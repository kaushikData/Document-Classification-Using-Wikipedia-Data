It was held in the United Kingdom in April 1949 and was hosted by that country's Prime Minister, Clement Attlee.\n\nThe principal topic of the conference was the relationship of India, which was intending to become a republic, to the Commonwealth, which, hitherto, had been an association of Britain and British dominions united by sharing a constitutional link by sharing the British sovereign as their head of state, in particular whether a Commonwealth state could become a republic and remain in the Commonwealth, if so, whether it had the same status in the Commonwealth as the dominions who had the British sovereign as their head of state. The Canadian government feared that if India was not permitted to remain in the Commonwealth as an autonomous republic then Pakistan, Ceylon, and South Africa would soon leave as well, resulting in the Commonwealth's collapse. Australian prime minister Ben Chifley was on one pole during the conference, arguing for maintaining a strong British connection, while South Africa's newly elected nationalist prime minister, D. F. Malan, was on the other pole arguing for complete independence.\n\nIn the London Declaration, Commonwealth prime ministers agreed to India's continued membership in the Commonwealth as a republic and that the King would have a new role in the Commonwealth not as a joint head of state but as \"the symbol of the free association of its member nations, and as such Head of the Commonwealth.\" \n\nFour days before the Conference met, Ireland formally declared itself a republic. The other members of the Commonwealth chose to regard that declaration as terminating Ireland's membership of the Commonwealth. Ireland had not participated in Commonwealth affairs since the 1930s but this was the first conference to be held after Ireland's membership was regarded as terminated.\n"}

{"id": "10658637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10658637", "title": "Astronomical art", "text": "Astronomical art\n\nAstronomical art is the aspect of Space art devoted to visualizing the wonders of outer space. A major emphasis of such art is the space environment as a new frontier for Humanity. Many other works portray alien worlds, extremes of matter such as black holes, and concepts arising from inspiration derived from astronomy.\n\nAstronomical art was largely pioneered in the 1940s and 50s by the abilities of Chesley Bonestell to solve formidable perspective problems, paint with the eye of a master matte artist to create a realistic visual impression, and to seek out the greatest experts in the fields which fascinated him. His work helped inspire many in the post war era to think about space travel, which seemed fantastic before the V-2 rocket. To this day numerous artists assist in bringing ideas into presentable form in the space community, both in portraying the latest ideas on how to leave Earth and in showing wonders awaiting us out there.\n\nAstronomical Art is the most recent of several art movements which have explored the inspirational ideas emerging from ongoing exploration of Earth, (Hudson River school, or Luminism) the distant past, (ancient history and prehistoric animal art) and finally the steadily revealed universe. Most Astronomical artists use traditional painting methods or digital equivalents in a way which brings the viewer to the frontiers of human knowledge gathered in the exploration of space. Such works usually portray things in the familiar visual language of realism extrapolated to exotic environments whose details reflect ongoing knowledge and educated guesswork. An example of the process of creating astronomical art would be studying and visiting desert environments to experience something of what it might be like on Mars, and painting based on such experience. Another would be to hear of something likely to be amazing to watch close up, then seeking out published articles or experts in the field. Usually there is an artistic effort to emphasize the favorable visual elements just as a photographer composes a picture. The best astronomical art shares with the viewer what it is that catches the artists imagination about the subject portrayed.\n\nScience Fiction magazines such as \"Fantasy and Science Fiction, Amazing, Astounding\" (later renamed \"Analog\"), and \"Galaxy\" served as a major outlet for the work of space and particularly astronomical artists in the 1950s. The several picture essay magazines of the time such as \"Life\", \"Collier's\", and \"Coronet\" were other major outlets for such art. Today astronomical art can be seen in magazines such as \"Sky and Telescope\", \"The Planetary Report\" and occasionally in \"Scientific American\". Individual web sites are by far the best place to see such work today. The NASA fine arts program has been an ongoing effort to hire artists to create works generally specific to a particular space project. This page is primarily devoted to what has traditionally been the most successful aspect of this program, the documenting of historical events in recognizable form by professional artists. The NASA Fine Arts Program operated in the era of seemingly unlimited progress at the time of the first head of that program, James Dean, although even then pictorial realism seemed a subset rather than a dominating visual influence.\n\nThe works which document space flight situations such as those referenced above are similar in concept to government efforts during World War II to send artists to battle zones to document things as they saw it, much of which appeared in contemporary \"Life\" magazines.\n\nAnother close parallel to Astronomical art is Dinosaur art. Both art schools explore unreachable realms with the intent to bring a sense of reality to them. The 'Grand Masters' of that field such as Charles R. Knight and Zdeněk Burian worked with experts in the field, using the best available information to create a realistic vision of something we can never behold with our own eyes. Ideally, as with Astronomical art, such a work tries to show what is known about the subject, with some educated guesswork to fill in the unknown and unknowable. We see more recent works by a healthy number of great dinosaur artists which reflect the growth in knowledge in body stances and likely feathers, etc. just as we see alien landscapes now painted which reveal the gathered knowledge instead of the craggy fantasies and the 'blue sky' Mars of yesteryear. Most of today's widely published space and astronomical artists have belonged since 1983 to the International Association of Astronomical Artists.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8136123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8136123", "title": "Cajun English", "text": "Cajun English\n\nCajun English, or Cajun Vernacular English, is the dialect of English spoken by Cajuns living in southern Louisiana and, to a lesser degree, in eastern Texas. Cajun English is significantly influenced by Cajun French, the historical language of the Cajun people, who descended from Acadian settlers and others. It is derived from Acadian French and is on the list of dialects of the English language for North America. This differed markedly from Metropolitan or Parisian French in terms of pronunciation and vocabulary, particularly because of the long isolation of Acadians, and even more so of Cajuns, from the Francophone world.\n\nEnglish is now spoken by the vast majority of the Cajun population, but French influence remains strong in terms of inflection and vocabulary. Their accent is considerably distinct from the General American. Cajun French is considered by many to be an endangered language, mostly used by elderly generations. However it is now frequently spoken by even the youngest Cajuns, and is seeing something of a cultural renaissance. In recent years, due to influence from tourism and a resurgence of pride in their cultural identity, a new era of linguistic innovation for Cajun English has begun. Dramatic differences are developing along both gender and generational lines as for how Cajun English is used and what it means to be Cajun.\n\nCajun English is spoken throughout Mississippi and up through the gulf of Texas. Its speakers are descendants of Acadians from Nova Scotia, Canada who, in 1765 moved to French-owned Mississippi when the British took control of Nova Scotia. In 1803, however, Britain purchased Mississippi as well and, in 1812, declared English as the official language of the state. Despite this many Cajuns at the time, who lived in small towns and were poorly educated, continued to use French exclusively. This isolated them from British colonists, who often ridiculed them and treated them like second-class citizens. In the 1930s English was the only language taught in schools, but the Cajun communities still resisted the change, using French at home and in their communities. The combination of being native French speakers and the incomplete English Cajun children were learning during their inconsistent public education led to the advent of Cajun English, a fusion of both languages.\n\nAfter World War II, however, Cajun English saw a severe decline in use, as young people entered the military and were consequently using English more and more in their daily lives. Meanwhile, Cajun children were beginning to receive better and more consistent education, which allowed them to become wealthier than the generation before them. At this time, there was still a lot of stigma associated with Cajun English and in order to achieve and maintain the new social status many young Cajuns now enjoyed, they abandoned French and Cajun English entirely in favor of more American cultural lifestyles and dialects. This shift caused Cajun English to become an endangered dialect. Many decades latter, the new Cajun generation perceived a loss of cultural identity and their efforts to recover it began the Cajun Renaissance. The corresponding upsurge of Cajun food, music, and festivities have been well received by tourists and are now supported by the local government. Although Cajun English has made a comeback, the bilingualism that originally created it, a knowledge of both French and English, has not. Cajun English speakers today typically do not speak French, and experts believe that it is unlikely that this part of the culture will be recovered. This shift away from bilingualism has changed the source of many of the phonological differences between Cajun English and Standard American English from interference caused by being a native French speaker to markers of Cajun identity.\n\nCajun English is distinguished by some of the following phonological features:\n\nThese are a few other examples.\n\nThere are several phrases used by Cajuns that are completely unknown to non-Cajun speakers. When outside of Acadiana, Cajuns tend to be made fun of for using these phrases. Young Cajuns are often jokingly discouraged from marrying non-Cajuns for this simple fact. Some common phrases are listed below:\n\n\"Come see\" is the equivalent of saying \"come here\" regardless of whether or not there is something to \"see.\" The French \"\"viens voir\",\" or \"\"venez voir\",\" meaning \"come\" or \"please come,\" is often used in Cajun French to ask people to come. This phrasing may have its roots in \"viens voir ici\" (), the French word for \"here.\"\n\nInstead of \"When did you go?\"\n\nTo \"save the dishes\" means to \"put away the dishes into cupboards where they belong after being washed\". While dishes are the most common subject, it is not uncommon to save other things. For example: Save up the clothes, saving the tools, save your toys.\n\n\"Getting/Running down at the store\" involves stepping out of a car to enter the store. Most commonly, the driver will ask the passenger, \"Do you want to run/get down with me?\" One can get down at any place, not just the store. The phrase \"get down\" may come from the act of \"getting down from a horse\" as many areas of Acadiana were only accessible by horse (or boat) well into the 20th century. It also may originate from the French language \"descendre\" meaning \"to get down\", much as some English-Spanish bilingual speakers say \"get down,\" from the Spanish \"bajar\".\n\n\"Makin' groceries\" refers to the act of buying groceries, rather than that of manufacturing them. The confusion originates from the direct translation of the American French phrase \"faire l'épicerie\" which is understood by speakers to mean \"to do the grocery shopping.\" \"Faire\" as used in the French language can mean either \"to do\" or \"to make.\" This is a term frequently used in New Orleans, but it's not used very much elsewhere in the Acadiana area.\n\n\"Makin water\" is using the bathroom. One would say, \"I need to go make water.\" It's mostly used in New Orleans.\n\nCajun English speakers can exhibit a tendency to use \"for\" instead of \"at\" when referring to time. For example, \"I'll be there for 2 o'clock.\" means \"I'll be there at 2 o'clock.\" Given the connection between Cajun English and Acadia, this phenomenon can also be seen among Canadian English speakers.\n\n\n\nSeveral characters of , particularly the narrator, have Cajun accents. Some characters even use Cajun French phrases.\n\n\n\n"}

When applied to cultural heritage conservation activities are generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer.\n\nPaper-based items, such as books, scrapbooks, manuscripts, maps, deeds, newspapers, drawings, water colors, miniatures, and postcards present distinctive concerns when it comes to care and conservation. Unlike works of art on paper, these items are often handled directly and repeatedly to access information. Even paper ephemera like newspapers and letters may be significant historical records or family mementos.\n\nThe first substantial work on the subject of book restoration was Alfred Bonnardot's \"Essai sur l'art de Restaurer les Estampes et les Livres\", first published in Paris in 1846.\n\nInherent vice is \"the quality of a material or an object to self-destruct or to be unusually difficult to maintain\". Paper, books, manuscripts, and ephemera are prime examples of materials subject to inherent vice. Early paper was handmade from plant fibers such as flax, hemp, and cotton: it is generally durable and can last for centuries. \n\nIn the mid-19th century, machine-made paper was introduced, and wood became the most common, least expensive ingredient, especially in newspapers. The presence of lignin in wood pulp paper causes acid to degrade the cellulose, which causes the paper to become unstable and discolored over time. In addition, paper has the natural ability to absorb and retain moisture from the atmosphere, making it prone to the growth of mold, fungi, and bacteria.\n\nBooks are inherently complex; they are often made of mixed materials ranging from parchment, leather, fabric, adhesives and thread. Some inks used in old books and manuscripts are harmful to paper. Iron gall ink, most commonly used from the 8th century through the end of the 19th century, contains acid and can corrode the paper in humid conditions.\n\nThe materials used to make books contain hundreds of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that break down over time. They are released into the air, where they become detectable as \"old-book smell\". A book's smell can provide conservators with hints as to its condition. Decomposing cellulose emits furfural, which has an almond-like scent. Lignin releases benzaldehyde and vanillin with a vanilla smell. Hexanal from cellulose and lignin gives off an earthy smell. Researchers have attempted to profile the smell of old books and relate human perceptions of smell to their chemical sources. “Chocolate” and “coffee” are the most frequently used descriptors from the Historic Paper Odour Wheel.\n\nEphemera, as the name implies, was never made to survive. Flyers, postcards, and programs are often printed on poor quality paper, carelessly handled, and likely to be haphazardly displayed or stored.\n\nInsects and vermin are naturally attracted to paper because paper is made of cellulose, starch and protein, materials that provide sources of nourishment. The most common pests are roaches, silverfish, and various types of beetles. Book lice feed on mold spores found on paper and cardboard, and although they do not cause visible damage, their decomposition and excretions can stain paper and may also nourish other pests, continuing the cycle of damage. To best discourage infestation, a clean and dust-free environment is desirable: food and drink should be kept away from storage areas. If pests are discovered, they should first be identified so that appropriate measures can be taken. Freezing the collection items is an option for pest mitigation: ideally (for dealing with most insects) the center of the item should be frozen within four hours at a temperature of -20 °C (about -4 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 72 hours, following which the materials may be thawed over a 24-hour period. However, some materials should not be frozen, such as books made with leather, because the cold temperatures may cause the fat to rise to the surface of the leather resulting in a white or yellow area called a bloom. The use of insecticides directly on collection materials is not generally recommended. However, if the infestation is severe, and fumigation is the best option, the affected items should be separated from the rest of the collection for treatment.\n\nExtremes of temperature or relative humidity are damaging from either end of the spectrum (low or high). High heat and low relative humidity can cause paper to become brittle and leather book bindings to crack. High temperatures and high relative humidity accelerates mold growth, foxing, staining, blooming, disintegration, and \"red rot\" in leather bindings. Fluctuations in temperatures and humidity may also cause cockling: a wrinkling or puckering preventing the surface from laying flat. Precise environmental levels for optimal preservation will depend on whether the collection is for use, storage, or a combination: in general, a cool environment (below 70 degrees Fahrenheit) and relatively dry air (between 30-50% relative humidity) is recommended.\n\nAir quality must also be taken into consideration. Dust tends to absorb moisture, providing a suitable environment to attract mold growth and insects. Dust can also become acidic when combined with skin oils and the surface of paper.\n\nAll kinds of light (sunlight, artificial light, spotlights) can be harmful. Light can result in fading, darkening, bleaching, and cellulose breakdown. Some inks and other pigments will fade if exposed to light, especially ultraviolet (UV) light present in normal daylight and from fluorescent bulbs. Any exposure to light can cause damage, as the effects are cumulative and cannot be reversed. Minimal or no exposure to light is ideal.\n\nOther than a poor environment, poor handling is the primary cause of deterioration for books, manuscripts, and ephemera. Recommendations for good handling to minimize damage include:\n\nGood storage can extend the life of an item and is an important aspect of preventative conservation. Storage should be cool, dry, clean, and stable. Items should be kept away from radiators or vents, which can cause environmental fluctuations.\n\nManuscripts and paper documents should be stored in protective archival-quality boxes and folders, made of acid-free and lignin-free materials. Documents that might be handled often may be stored or encapsulated in a clear polyester (Mylar) film sleeve or folder. As added protection acid formation, paper-based storage materials may have a buffer, such as calcium carbonate, which can neutralize acids as they form in the storage materials. Boxes should not be overfilled. Items may be interleaved with acid/lignin-free paper. If boxes are only partially full, spacers may be used, or the box may be stored horizontally. Large format material is best stored in a plan cabinet with shallow drawers. The rolling of large items (e.g. maps) should be avoided where possible; but if there is no other option, the item should be rolled around a large diameter archival quality tube. The outside of the rolled item may also be covered with archival quality paper.\n\nThe best shelving for books is baked enamel steel shelving that stands away from exterior walls. Average size books should be shelved vertically, side-by-side so they can support each other. If a book is removed from the shelf, it may be replaced with a foam block to maintain verticality. Shelves should not be overpacked. Oversized or fragile books may be stored horizontally and completely flat, but stacking should be kept to a minimum. Books should be placed in supportive and protective boxes, to prevent soiling and abrasion as well as to provide structural support. Book boxes may range from simple four-flap enclosures made of archival safe paper or cardboard to custom clamshell or drop-spine boxes covered in book cloth.\n\n\nReformatting options include photocopying, digitization, and microfilming. Many libraries and universities have book copiers where the book can be supported at an angle, avoiding the damage to its structure that can be caused by forcing it flat.\n\nIn spite of the digital revolution, preservation microfilming is still used. Microfilm can have a life expectancy of 500 or more years, and only needs light and magnification to read.\n\nIn general, the cleaning and repair of paper documents and books should ideally be assigned to a professional conservator. Many paper or book conservators are members of a professional body, such as the American Institute for Conservation (AIC) or the Guild of Bookworkers (both in the United States), or the Archives and Records Association (in the United Kingdom and Ireland).\n\n\n\n"}

The Africana Studies program offers around 23 graduate and undergraduate courses each semester. Africana offers an undergraduate major for students in the Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences as well as a Ph.D through the Cornell University Graduate School. The John Henrik Clarke Africana Library, located at the Center, focuses on the social, economic, and political dimensions of the history and cultures of peoples of African descent. It has more than 17,000 volumes.\n\nThe ASRC occupies 310 Triphammer Rd in the Village of Cayuga Heights, New York. Its director is Gerard Aching.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Black Community began to ask for academic programs and funding for ethnic studies, including the establishment of an Africana studies program. By the spring of 1969, the Administration had recruited James Turner to be the first director of the ASRC. The ASRC offered its first classes in the fall of 1969 in its first building at 320 Wait Avenue, after the subsequent Willard Straight Hall Takeover. On April 1, 1970, 320 Wait Avenue was destroyed in a racially motivated arson attack. The ASRC was temporarily relocated to the unoccupied North Campus low-rise dormitory 8, and was permanently relocated to 310 Triphammer Road. However, a number of irreplaceable documents, including Turner's draft Ph.D. dissertation were lost in the blaze.\n\nSubsequently, controversy arose because in ASRC's early years, its classes were not printed in the University's course and room roster making it difficult for white students to enroll. Instead, course offerings were distributed to COSEP students. As a result, from 1969 to 1972, no white students enrolled in ASRC classes. In addition to limited distribution of ASRC's course offering, many classes had an \"experiential prerequisite\" requiring that students have the \"black experience\" before they are eligible to enroll in the class. In addition, enrollment in certain classes required the approval of Turner, the Director of ASRC, who would routinely fail to meet with white students who made appointments to see him at his office. On the third anniversary of the ASRC, the Board of Trustees formed a committee headed by Lisle C. Carter, Jr. to evaluate the progress of the ASRC, and three white students successfully enrolled in an ASRC course on South African history. The Trustees decided to continue the ASRC.\n\nOn April 15–17, 2010, the ASRC hosted a scholarly conference in celebration of its 40th anniversary.\n\nFrom its inception, the ASRC reported directly to the Provost independent of any undergraduate college. In 2005, the \"Report of Visiting Committee to the Africana Studies and Research Center\" which consisted of scholars from Northwestern, Yale and New York University found the ASRC reporting to the Provost to be a \"peculiar arrangement,\" and recommended that Cornell \"revisit this arrangement.\" On December 1, 2010, Cornell Provost Kent Fuchs announced that the Center would become a department in the Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences effective July 1, 2011. Fuchs said that the shift would facilitate the start of an Africana PhD program. In response, Robert L. Harris, Jr resigned as ASRC's director. Elizabeth Adkins-Regan and David Harris served as interim co-directors until July 2012. Gerard Aching subsequently served as director for the 2012-13 academic year before current interim director Salah Hassan filled in.\n\nIn Fall 2013, the Graduate Field of Africana Studies at Cornell University established the first Ph.D. program in Africana Studies in New York State and is expecting its first cohort Fall 2014.\n\n\n"}

The discipline is relatively new, but offers novel insights on new technological advances and their effect on culture and society.\n\nDonna Haraway’s 1984 \"\"\"\"A Cyborg Manifesto\" was the first widely-read academic text to explore the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the cyborg. A sub-focus group within the American Anthropological Association's annual meeting in 1992 presented a paper entitled \"Cyborg Anthropology\", which cites Haraway's \"Manifesto\". The group described cyborg anthropology as the study of how humans define humanness in relationship to machines, as well as the study of science and technology as activities that can shape and be shaped by culture. This includes studying the ways that all people, including those who are not scientific experts, talk about and conceptualize technology. The sub-group was closely related to STS and the Society for the Social Studies of Science. More recently, Amber Case has been responsible for explicating the concept of Cyborg Anthropology to the general public. She believes that a key aspect of cyborg anthropology is the study of networks of information among humans and technology.\n\nMany academics have helped develop cyborg anthropology, and many more who haven't heard the term still are today conducting research that may be considered cyborg anthropology, particularly research regarding technologically advanced prosthetics and how they can influence an individual's life. A 2014 summary of holistic American anthropology intersections with cyborg concepts (whether explicit or not) by Joshua Wells explained how the information-rich and culture-laden ways in which humans imagine, construct, and use tools may extend the cyborg concept through the human evolutionary lineage. Amber Case generally tells people that the actual number of self-described cyborg anthropologists is \"about seven\". The Cyborg Anthropology Wiki, overseen by Case, aims to make the discipline as accessible as possible, even to people who do not have a background in anthropology.\n\nCyborg anthropology uses traditional methods of anthropological research like ethnography and participant observation, accompanied by statistics, historical research, and interviews. By nature it is a multidisciplinary study; cyborg anthropology can include aspects of Science and Technology Studies, cybernetics, feminist theory, and more. It primarily focuses on how people use discourse about science and technology in order to make these meaningful in their lives. \n\nOriginally coined in a 1960 paper about space exploration, the term is short for cybernetic organism. A cyborg is traditionally defined as a system with both organic and inorganic parts. In the narrowest sense of the word, cyborgs are people with machinated body parts. These cyborg parts may be restorative technologies that help a body function where the organic system has failed, like pacemakers, insulin pumps, and bionic limbs, or enhanced technologies that improve the human body beyond its natural state. In the broadest sense, all human interactions with technology could qualify as a cyborg. Most cyborg anthropologists lean towards the latter view of the cyborg; some, like Amber Case, even claim that humans are already cyborgs because people's daily life and sense of self is so intertwined with technology. Haraway's \"Cyborg Manifesto\" suggests that technology like virtual avatars, artificial insemination, sexual reassignment surgery, and artificial intelligence might make dichotomies of sex and gender irrelevant, even nonexistent. She goes on to say that other human distinctions (like life and death, human and machine, virtual and real) may similarly disappear in the wake of the cyborg.\n\nDigital anthropology is concerned with how digital advances are changing how people live their lives, as well as consequent changes to how anthropologists do ethnography and to a lesser extent how digital technology can be used to represent and undertake research. Cyborg anthropology also looks at disciplines like genetics and nanotechnology, which are not strictly digital. Cybernetics/informatics covers the range of cyborg advances better than the label digital.\n\nQuestions of subjectivity, agency, actors, and structures have always been of interest in social and cultural anthropology. In cyborg anthropology the question of what type of cybernetic system constitutes an actor/subject becomes all the more important. Is it the actual technology that acts on humanity (the Internet), the general techno-culture (Silicon Valley), government sanctions (net neutrality), specific innovative humans (Steve Jobs), or some type of combination of these elements? Some academics believe that only humans have agency and technology is an object humans act upon, while others argue that humans have no agency and culture is entirely shaped by material and technological conditions. Actor-network theory (ANT), proposed by Bruno Latour, is a theory that helps scholars understand how these elements work together to shape techno-cultural phenomena. Latour suggests that actors and the subjects they act on are parts of larger networks of mutual interaction and feedback loops. Humans and technology both have the agency to shape one another. ANT best describes the way cyborg anthropology approaches the relationship between humans and technology. Similarly, Wells explain how new forms of networked political expression such as the Pirate Party movement and free and open-source software philosophies are generated from human reliance on information technologies in all walks of life.\n\nResearchers like Kathleen Richardson have conducted ethnographic research on the humans who build and interact with artificial intelligence. Recently, Stuart Geiger, a PhD student at University of California, Berkeley suggested that robots may be capable of creating a culture of their own, which researchers could study with ethnographic methods. Anthropologists react to Geiger with skepticism because, according to Geiger, they believe that culture is specific to living creatures and ethnography limited to human subjects. \n\nThe most basic definition of anthropology is the study of humans. However, cyborgs, by definition, describe something that is not entirely an organic human. Moreover, limiting a discipline to the study of humans may be difficult the more that technology allows humans to transcend the normal conditions of organic life. The prospect of a posthuman condition calls into question the nature and necessity of a field focused on studying humans. \n\nSociologist of technology Zeynep Tufekci argues that any symbolic expression of ourselves, even the most ancient cave painting, can be considered \"posthuman\" because it exists outside of our physical bodies. To her, this means that the human and the \"posthuman\" have always existed alongside one another, and anthropology has always concerned itself with the posthuman as well as the human. Neil L. Whitehead and Michael Welsch point out that the concern that posthumanism will decenter the human in anthropology ignores the discipline's long history of engaging with the unhuman (like spirits and demons that humans believe in) and the culturally \"subhuman\" (like marginalized groups within a society).. Contrarily, Wells, taking a deep-time perspective, points out the ways that tool-centric and technologically communicated values and ethics typify the human condition, and that cross-cultural and ethnological trends in conceptions of lifeways, power dynamics, and definitions of humanity often incorporate information-rich technological symbology. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1112855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1112855", "title": "Drawn Together", "text": "Drawn Together\n\nDrawn Together is an American adult animated sitcom that ran on Comedy Central from October 27, 2004 to November 14, 2007. The series was created by Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein, and uses a sitcom format with a reality TV show setting.\n\nThe show's eight characters are a combination of personalities that were recognizable and familiar prior to the series. Differently, however, \"Drawn Together\" used caricatures of established cartoon characters and stock characters. In addition, their character traits parody personality types that are typically seen in reality TV shows.\n\nComedy Central advertised it as the first animated reality TV series, and in some episodes, characters participate in challenges that are similar to reality TV challenges, although the premise is largely dropped in later seasons.\n\nAfter three seasons, the show was cancelled. Subsequently, a direct-to-video film and series finale, \"\" was released on April 20, 2010.\n\n\nThe show's visual style is that of digital ink-and-paint. The style was chosen both for the retro feel it gives the show and for the versatility and freedom it allows the animators, providing an environment in which it is possible to combine many different styles of animation. Another unique aspect of the show is that, where most cartoons present their characters, though animated, as real within the show's world, the \"Drawn Together\" characters retain their identities as cartoon characters even within their animated world, and acknowledge their status as animations. The show has cameo appearances by famous characters (or in some cases, copyright-avoiding clones) from all across the animated spectrum. In keeping with the various animation styles for the characters, Wooldoor and Toot have four fingers on each hand, whereas Clara, Foxxy, Hero and Xandir have five. In promotional artwork for the show, Toot and Wooldoor are drawn with the standard five fingers, but in the show itself they have four. Whereas most of the characters are drawn with black outlines, Clara and items belonging to her are drawn with soft edges, a reference to Disney animation techniques, which involve \"cleanup\" of any black outlines. Contrasting, Toot is drawn in the grainy, high-contrast monochrome of her era's technology.\n\nThe show was made by Rough Draft Studios in Glendale, California, with much of the animation done at the studio's facilities in South Korea. A gag in \"The Drawn Together Clip Show\" is that they show a list of all the Korean children who died animating the show.\n\nThe movie was produced by 6 Point Harness and done completely with Flash animation due to budget cuts.\n\nA total of three seasons were produced. Season 3 began airing on October 5, 2006, and took a mid-season break which started on November 15, 2006. The second half of season three began airing on October 4, 2007.\n\nIn March 2007, it was announced that creators Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein had left Comedy Central and signed a two-year contract with 20th Century Fox Television to create new series and/or work on the studio's existing shows.\n\nThe season three finale included multiple jokes about the show's cancellation. \"TV Guide\" listed this episode as a series finale and described the episode as follows: \"The series wraps up with the housemates participating in a singing competition as they look back on their recent misadventures.\"\n\nIn March 2008, Tara Strong confirmed that the show had been cancelled, and the back of the third season DVDs box refers to it as the \"third and final season\".\n\nSince cancellation, the show has partial rotation late-nights, and airs uncensored on Comedy Central's \"Secret Stash\" and on Logo.\n\nDespite the cancellation, the official page of \"Drawn Together\" in Myspace had suggested the fans call Comedy Central and convince them to make a new season.\n\nThe plots and humor of \"Drawn Together\" are adult-oriented and laden with shock comedy. The humor is largely morbid and satirical in nature, its primary focus being the mockery of stereotypes and the casual exploration of taboo subject matter, such as masturbation, paraphilia, kinky sex, BDSM, homosexuality or gay marriage, abortion, rape, incest, pedophilia, spousal abuse, racism, homophobia, antisemitism, necrophilia, terrorism, violence and death. Episodes such as \"Gay Bash\" or \"A Very Special Drawn Together Afterschool Special\", for example, feature the exploration of homosexuality as a central theme. Nearly all episodes feature at least one death, and several episodes feature characters going on killing sprees or perpetrating or becoming victims of , though the main characters will subsequently return alive and uninjured, either in the subsequent episode or within the time frame of the same episode. The show breaks the fourth wall regularly; on one occasion, the show mocks Adam Carolla, the voice of Spanky Ham.\n\nDespite the show's overt and underlined sexuality, the characters' innocent and sensual sides are often the main driving force of the plot (alongside comedic non-sequitur moments intended to parody standard plot lines). This adds romantic comedy, melodrama, action film, war film, court drama and other genres to the pool of spoofing material. Sincere feelings the characters are forced to experience (and comic disregard thereof) seem to add integrity to the plot and imbue every episode with a genuine moral message, made more efficient by constant spoofing of moral message clichés like \"character X has learned a valuable lesson\".\nComedy Central's original tagline for the show was \"Find out what happens when cartoon characters stop being polite… and start making out in hot tubs\", referring to Clara and Foxxy's kiss in the pilot episode. The line is a parody of \"The Real World\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s tagline, \"Find out what happens when people stop being polite… and start getting real.\" The aforementioned hot tub kiss is considered one of the show's defining images; Comedy Central based nearly all of its first-season promotional material for \"Drawn Together\" on it. In \"\", a billboard featuring the hot tub kiss is a major plot point in the film and is the main reason why the Network Head is hunting the housemates down in order to kill them in the movie, due to the billboard being the cause of his wife and daughter's death.\n\nThe extensive use of stereotypes is another controversial aspect of the show, though the intent is actually to make fun of bigotry. As Jess Harnell states in the DVD commentary for \"Hot Tub\", \"Most of the racism on the show is coming from people who are so obviously stupid about it; it really isn't that threatening\". (Jewish people are mocked, including creators and principal cast member Tara Strong.) Other content known to be featured on some episodes are occurrences of natural disasters, depictions of dictators and sexual fetishes.\n\n\"Drawn Together\" is heavy with popular culture references. Animation is a major source of material; as mentioned above, many characters from comics and animated cartoons make cameo appearances and often are the subjects of parody. However, numerous live-action films, TV shows, and video games are referenced as well. Reality shows are another prime inspiration, not surprising given that \"Drawn Together\" is presented as a reality show that takes place in a cartoon world. However, although many of the first-season plots made extensive use of the reality show scenario, this aspect of the show has largely been de-emphasized in later episodes. The spoofing of film and television clichés is another common theme on the show; many \"Drawn Together\" stories are parodies of overused plots from TV and films.\n\nOne notable factor of the series are musical numbers. Some are parodies of real songs (i.e. in \"Hot Tub\", the song \"Black Chick's Tongue\" is a parody of \"A Whole New World\" from \"Aladdin\"; in the episode \"Super Nanny\", the song at the DMV is a riff on \"Who's That Guy?\" from \"Grease 2\"; in \"Freaks & Greeks\", the song at the end is a take on \"Summer Nights\" from \"Grease\"; and \"You'll Really Love Being Abandoned Here\" in \"Alzheimer's That Ends Well\" is a reference to \"I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here\" from \"Annie\"). Other songs are those written by the show's creators/writers, like \"The Bully Song\" from \"Requiem for a Reality Show\" and \"La-La-La-La-Labia\" in \"Clara's Dirty Little Secret\"). Only two episodes (\"Lost in Parking Space, Part One\" and \"Nipple Ring-Ring Goes to Foster Care\") do not feature a musical performance.\n\nIn terms of continuity, events in different episodes contradict each other, as there is a loose sense of canon. One such example is in \"The Other Cousin\" and \"N.R.A.y RAY\", in which Toot is pictured with a penis, something that is not consistent with other episodes. Another is Foxxy's various and contradictory stories about her son Timmy (one involves selling him on the black market, another involves her accidentally shooting him after believing him to be rabid, when he was really just brushing his teeth). Plots and gags are often used that do not make any type of internal sense, but are used as one-off jokes, as when Foxxy, who is in her twenties, is said to have a teenage grandson. Some episodes begin with a fake recap of events supposed to have happened in a (non-existent) previous episode. According to executive producer Bill Freiberger, \"Very little on \"Drawn Together\" can be considered canon. If you try to find continuity on this show you'll drive yourself nuts. The only thing that's consistent is we try to make the show as funny as possible. And we'd never let a little thing like continuity get in the way of that.\"\n\nOccasionally, episodes of \"Drawn Together\" are shown with less editing for content during \"Secret Stash\", a Comedy Central program aired on weekends at 1am that showcases films (i.e. \"Not Another Teen Movie\"), comedy specials (Comedy Central Roast), and animated programs (this and \"South Park\") with uncensored language. Though \"Secret Stash\" programs typically have the nudity still censored, \"Drawn Together\" is an exception to this. Some nudity not seen in the original broadcast is shown in the \"Secret Stash\" version, while the nudity in other scenes is censored with a caption reading \"DVD only\"; this is done as a way of promoting the show's DVD releases.\n\n\"Drawn Together\" features a cast of voice actors, which contains a mix of veteran voice actors (Tara Strong, Cree Summer, Jess Harnell and James Arnold Taylor) and newcomers to the field (Abbey DiGregorio, Jack Plotnick and Adam Carolla).\n\nThree of the show's voice actors had worked with creators Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein on other projects: Jack Plotnick on \"Action\", and Adam Carolla and Abbey McBride on \"The Man Show\". Two of \"Drawn Together\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s guest stars also came from the casts of earlier Jeser/Silverstein projects: \"The Other Cousin\" guest star Sarah Silverman (from \"Greg the Bunny\"), and Carolla's \"Man Show\" co-host Jimmy Kimmel, who guest-starred in \"Xandir and Tim, Sitting in a Tree\" and \"Alzheimer's That Ends Well\".\n\nPrincipal cast member Tara Strong has stated that she deeply loves the show, as it was such a departure from the family-friendly productions that she was used to working on at the time. The only problems that she had with it were a few jokes related to Anne Frank.\n\nOriginally, Xandir was to have been played by Nat Faxon, but he was fired following the first table read because the network felt his portrayal of the character was too stereotypically gay. Actor Jack Plotnick ended up being cast because he could play a gay man without resorting to stereotypical mannerisms such as the gay lisp.\n\nIn addition to their regular roles, the show's cast provides many of the minor roles and guest voices on the series, Summer, Strong, Harnell and Taylor in particular. In the DVD commentary for \"Hot Tub\", Tara Strong jokes that this is because the show does not have a lot of money to pay guest stars. Chris Edgerly appears in the majority of Season One and Two episodes despite not having a regular role on the series.\n\nThe pilot episode, \"Hot Tub\", was given mediocre reviews, which focused mostly on its crudity. \"USA Today\" deemed \"Drawn Together\" \"the smutty offspring of \"Real World\" and \"Superfriends\"\", stating that the pilot pushed the limits of taste, being overpowered by violence, sex, and disgusting subject matter. According to \"The New York Times\", \"Hot Tub\", while it had many good sight gags, did not go far enough in parodying reality television. The domination of Clara's racism in the story was criticized as being a weak attempt to \"send up racism while still showcasing its cruel excitement\". Toot's cutting was praised as a good parody of self-harm presented on reality shows, but Spanky's flatulence was considered more disgusting than humorous.\n\nThe pilot episode was given an F rating from \"Entertainment Weekly\", and the subplot for a second-season episode, \"Xandir and Tim, Sitting in a Tree\", involved the majority of the housemates seeking revenge for this rating. The latter episode also received an F from the magazine. Despite the criticism, the Season 1 overall received positive reviews, with a Metacritic rating of 7.6 out of 10.\n\n\"TV Guide\" named \"Drawn Together\" in its 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time list in 2013.\n\nSeason releases\nThe first season of \"Drawn Together\" was released on DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment on October 4, 2005. Its release was timed to coincide with the premiere of Season Two on television. The set includes all seven aired first-season episodes. (By the time the release was finalized, it had been determined that the unaired \"Terms of Endearment\" would air during Season Two, so it was left off the set and eventually released as part of the Season Two set.) The profanity and nudity are intact and uncensored. Some shows also contain additional lines and scenes. Special features include audio commentary on select episodes by creators Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein along with assorted cast and crew members, in addition to deleted scenes and karaoke/sing-along versions of the show's songs.\n\nThe set has a game called the \"Censored/Uncensored\" game: A line is given, and the viewer must decide if the line aired on television as given (uncensored), or if it had to be altered significantly or deleted (censored). Some of the censored lines appear intact in the extended DVD version of the episode. Getting at least 11 of the 19 questions correct unlocks a hidden feature, a prank phone call by Jeser and Silverstein to their agent regarding the royalties they are to receive for the DVD audio commentaries.\n\nThe song \"Time of My Life\" from \"Dirty Pranking No. 2\" had to be left off the first season DVD because of copyright concerns. The show mocked the situation in the lyrics of the replacement music.\n\nSeason Two Uncensored was released on September 25, 2007. Like the Season One set, the set features audio commentaries by Jeser and Silverstein along with assorted cast and crew members, as well as karaoke/singalong versions of the show's songs. The set also contains, in the words of the box art, \"potentially annoying\" commentary on the commentary for \"Terms of Endearment\". The behind-the-scenes interviews in the set are the same ones that appear on Comedy Central's website, which feature each of the voice actors talking about his or her character, along with a separate interview with creators Jeser and Silverstein. Tara Strong does two separate interviews, one for each of her characters (Princess Clara and Toot Braunstein).\n\nThe set includes the controversial horse shot from \"Terms of Endearment\", which was not allowed to air on television.\n\nSeason Three Uncensored was released on May 13, 2008.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "210254", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210254", "title": "Dynasty", "text": "Dynasty\n\nA dynasty (, ) is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a feudal or monarchical system, but sometimes also appearing in elective republics. The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a \"noble house\", which may be styled as \"royal\", \"princely\", \"ducal\", \"comital\", etc., depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members. Historians periodize the histories of many sovereign states, such as Ancient Egypt, the Carolingian Empire and Imperial China, using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term \"dynasty\" may be used to delimit the era during which the family reigned and to describe events, trends, and artifacts of that period (\"a Ming-dynasty vase\"). The word \"dynasty\" itself is often dropped from such adjectival references (\"a Ming vase\").\n\nUntil the 19th century, it was taken for granted that a legitimate function of a monarch was to aggrandize his dynasty: that is, to increase the territory, wealth, and power of his family members. The longest-surviving dynasty in the world is the Imperial House of Japan, otherwise known as the Yamato dynasty, whose reign is traditionally dated to .\n\nPrior to the 20th century, dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been reckoned patrilineally, such as under the Frankish Salic law. In nations where it was permitted, succession through a daughter usually established a new dynasty in her husband's ruling house. This has changed in some places in Europe, where succession law and convention have maintained dynasties \"de jure\" through a female. For example, the House of Windsor is maintained through the children of Queen Elizabeth II, similarly with the monarchy of the Netherlands, whose dynasty remained the House of Orange-Nassau through three successive queens regnant. The earliest such example among the major European monarchies was in Russia in the 18th century, where the name of the House of Romanov was maintained through a non-ruling female.\n\nIn South Africa's Limpopo Province, Balobedu determined descent matrilineally, while rulers have at other times adopted the name of their mother's dynasty when coming into her inheritance. Less frequently, a monarchy has alternated or been rotated, in a multidynastic (or polydynastic) system – that is, the most senior living members of parallel dynasties, at any point in time, constitute the line of succession.\n\nNot all feudal states or monarchies were/are ruled by a dynasty. Modern examples are the Vatican City State and Principality of Andorra. Throughout history, there were monarchs that did not belong to any dynasty. Non-dynastic rulers include Ptolemy Keraunos of Macedon, Arioald of the Lombards, and Phocas of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nThe word \"dynasty\" is sometimes used informally for people who are not rulers but are, for example, members of a family with influence and power in other areas, such as a series of successive owners of a major company. It is also extended to unrelated people, such as major poets of the same school or various rosters of a single sports team.\n\nThe word \"dynasty\" derives from Latin \"\", which comes from Greek \"dynastéia\" (), where it referred to \"power\", \"dominion\", and \"rule\" itself. It was the abstract noun of \"dynástēs\" (), the agent noun of \"dynamis\" (), \"power\" or \"ability\", from \"dýnamai\" (), \"to be able\".\n\nA ruler in a dynasty is sometimes referred to as a \"dynast\", but this term is also used to describe any member of a reigning family who retains a right to succeed to a throne. For example, following his abdication, Edward VIII of the United Kingdom ceased to be a dynastic member of the House of Windsor.\n\nA \"dynastic marriage\" is one that complies with monarchical house law restrictions, so that the descendants are eligible to inherit the throne or other royal privileges. The marriage of Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange, to Máxima Zorreguieta in 2002 was dynastic, for example, and their eldest child is expected to inherit the Dutch crown eventually. But the marriage of his younger brother Prince Friso to Mabel Wisse Smit in 2003 lacked government support and parliamentary approval. Thus Friso forfeited his place in the order of succession, lost his title as a \"Prince of the Netherlands\", and left his children without dynastic rights.\n\nIn historical and monarchist references to formerly reigning families, a \"dynast\" is a family member who would have had succession rights, were the monarchy's rules still in force. For example, after the 1914 assassinations of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his morganatic wife Sophie von Hohenberg, their son Max was bypassed for the Austrian throne because he was not a Habsburg dynast. Even since abolition of the Austrian monarchy, Max and his descendants have not been considered the rightful pretenders by Austrian monarchists, nor have they claimed that position.\n\nThe term \"dynast\" is sometimes used only to refer to agnatic descendants of a realm's monarchs, and sometimes to include those who hold succession rights through cognatic royal descent. The term can therefore describe overlapping but distinct sets of people. For example, David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon, a nephew of Queen Elizabeth II through her sister, Princess Margaret, is in the line of succession to the British crown: in that sense he is a British dynast. Yet he is not a male-line member of the royal family, and is therefore not a dynast of the House of Windsor.\n\nOn the other hand, the German aristocrat Prince Ernst August of Hanover (born 1954), a male-line descendant of George III of the United Kingdom, possesses no legal British name, titles or styles (although he is entitled to re-claim the once-royal dukedom of Cumberland), was born in the line of succession to the British crown and was bound by Britain's Royal Marriages Act 1772 until it was repealed when the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 took effect on 26 March 2015. Thus, in 1999 he requested and obtained formal permission from Elizabeth II to marry the Roman Catholic Princess Caroline of Monaco. Yet a clause of the English Act of Settlement 1701 remained in effect at that time, stipulating that dynasts who marry Roman Catholics are considered \"dead\" for the purpose of succession to the throne. That exclusion, too, ceased to apply on 26 March 2015, with retroactive effect for those who had been dynasts prior to triggering it by marriage to a Catholic.\n\nSome dynasties appear more than once in this list, because:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyal families\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a list of rulers of the Huns.\nPeriod Ruler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crown of the Kingdom of England and Ireland merged with that of the Kingdom of Scotland to form a personal union between England-Ireland and Scotland (the former a personal union itself)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough in elected governments, rule does not pass automatically by inheritance, political power often accrues to generations of related individuals in republics. Eminence, influence, tradition, genetics, and nepotism may contribute to the phenomenon.\n\nFamily dictatorships are a different concept in which political power passes within a family because of the overwhelming authority of the leader, rather than informal power accrued to the family.\n\nSome political dynasties:\n\n\n\n"}

Hopkins (August 11, 1865 – November 5, 1951) was an American professional horseman who at one time performed with the Ringling Brothers Circus. He was supposedly a legendary long-distance rider, who won 400 races, and was recognized by his contemporaries as supporting the preservation of the mustang.\n\nThough the Disney film \"Hidalgo\" was based on Hopkins' purported story, his alleged exploits are most likely fictional. He has been described as a \"fabulator and a confidence man whose tales of heroic deeds were little more than tall stories.\" Few items in his accounts have been verified by outside, reliable, third-party sources.\n\nHopkins said he was born to a Lakota mother and European-American father, that he grew up in both cultures, and that he learned to ride and care for horses at an early age. He claimed that his father, Charles Hopkins, was a scout for George Armstrong Custer and he was captured by Chief Gall in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, but he was released four months later and returned to Fort Laramie, which is where Frank said he was born and raised (his father being with Custer cannot be substantiated). The Fort Laramie National Historic site has no record of his birth or family. There is a marriage certificate that Hopkins signed in New York in 1929 where his age was put at 44 which, if true, would place his birth in 1885. However, the photograph shown, said to have been taken in 1905, seems to show the appearance of a middle-aged man.\n\nHopkins claimed to have been a cowboy and professional horseman in the American West, where he gained a reputation for distance riding. In his autobiographical memoir (unpublished in his lifetime) and accounts to friends, he claimed to have been featured as one of the \"Rough Riders of the World\" in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, which toured in Europe as well as the United States.\n\nA number of his stories have been debunked by many historians. Examples include:\nIn 1926 Hopkins was foreman of a construction crew, digging a subway tunnel in downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the 1940s, Hopkins claimed he was honorary chair at a Vermont Races, though the Vermont Historical Society has no knowledge of any races in Vermont. Hopkins also claimed to have won a Texas-to-Vermont endurance race at age 21, riding an 800-pound buckskin, but there is no evidence in contemporary sources that such a race was ever held. Up to the time of his death in 1951, he remained an outspoken champion of the threatened mustang which he called \"the most significant animal on the North American continent.\"\n\nFrank Hopkins is interred in Lutheran All Faiths Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens County, New York.\n\nHopkins' life and the story of the race in Arabia were the inspiration for the 2004 film \"Hidalgo\", written by John Fusco, directed by Joe Johnston, and starring Viggo Mortensen. The Walt Disney Company marketed the film as \"based on a true story\" although subsequent investigations failed to find any evidence of such a race. Lakota scholar, historian and doctor Vine Deloria says \"Hopkins' claims are so outrageously false that one wonders why the Disney people were attracted to this material at all.\"\n\n"}

The presence of glass in Sub-Saharan Africa mostly consists of the importation of glass beads shipped primarily from the Middle East and Indian as early as 200-300AD; later, from Portugal, the Netherlands, and Venice.\n\nAs most African cultures have long histories of crafting and adornment with beads made from wood, bone and shell, the introduction of glass as a bead material was widely and rapidly received. The exchange of glass beads for local goods such as ivory, gold and slaves aided in the accumulation of wealth and creation of unequal power dynamics still apparent today. Archaeological evidence, primarily from various burial sites from the West and coastal port cities in the East, confirm the import of hundreds of thousands of glass beads.4 3 These assemblages boast rich varieties in shape, colour, texture and patterning. While most Sub-Saharan glass was imported as pre-formed beads, there is evidence of the importation of glass fragments and ingots to be used in local beadmaking practices.5 Preliminary excavations also exhibit evidence of indigenous glass production from raw materials, a technology previously thought unknown to this region of the world.6 4, recent evidence has shown that glass making has been started separate from the general glass trade centuries before European and Arab contact \n\nAs subsistence-level herding was common throughout much of Sub-Saharan Africa, bead adornment was an apt medium for self and cultural expression; whereas a more permanent art form would have proven impractical. Through various bead shape formations, colouring choices and assemblage methods, individuals were able to express complex information which was particularly useful in the absence of written language. Notions such as age, marital status and relative economic wealth were communicated through careful selection of symbolic glass beads. The remelting and reworking of existing beads also suggests that the shape and style of glass beads held specific cultural values; various regions were able to imitate more favourable foreign styles, create unique forms or produce much larger beads than what was available through international trade, effectively expressing local distinctiveness. 7 8 Glass beads also provided a means of connecting with ones ancestors. Known as Heirloom beads, these beads were typically translucent, resembling wax, having a discoid shape and usually could be dated back to the middle and late Iron Age. Whether strung as jewellery, attached to clothing or stored unassembled, Heirloom beads were extremely prized and often passed down from generation to generation. Additionally, glass beads have been linked to a number of religious and symbolic practices, primarily as offerings to deities at sacred locations and constructed shrines. 4\n\nGlass beads in Sub-Saharan regions were used as an economic tool, denoting wealth and political power. Yoruba kings, or Obas, often encouraged complicated and abundant glass beadworking as a visual symbol of their nation’s wealth. Production of beads in great quantities could also be offered by Obas to various deities as a symbol of appreciation of such granted political and economic power. Aje Ilekes, discs of melted cullet (recycled material) glass with beads embedded, were produced by intentionally destroying and remelting glass beads, serving as a status symbol of power and wealth. Aje Ilekes are still used today as a monetary system, often exchanged as wedding dowry.4 In the archaeological record it is common to find numerous glass beads and beadworking tools such as stone anvils and crucibles included in burial sites suggesting the objects’ cultural and economic importance.4\n\nAttempts to determine date and origin of glass beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa have been made with varying success. It is generally agreed that glass beads were present in the Sub-Saharan world by at least 300AD, having been imported from the Middle East and South East Asian regions. Transported by sea, shipments arrived to coastal ports such as Mtwapa and Ungwana in Kenya and were then distributed inland via local trade networks and kinship relations.3 On land, glass bead cargos travelled through North Africa south to areas such as Gao in Mali, as well as Nigeria, Ghana and Benin. The expansion of the Roman Empire helped to broaden trade patterns and the introduction of the camel as means of transport significantly fostered the spread of imported goods. European nations entered the African trading market, beginning with Portugal, Italy and Bohemia in the 15th century, followed by the Dutch, English, French, Belgians and Germans. By the 17th century, the Netherlands managed to secure an impressive monopoly on the glass bead exchange with Sub-Saharan Africa. A Dutch merchant and entrepreneur named Sir Nicholas Crisp is recorded to have been awarded a patent “for the sole making and vending of beads and beugles to trade to Guinea,” in 1632.7\n\nDuring the Medieval Period, trade of a particular style of glass bead, the Trade Wind bead, dominated the market. These beads ranged in colour and length but could be mass-produced.3 Termed “Trade Wind beads” due to the use of monsoon winds for navigation, these beads were shipped throughout the Indian Ocean Trading Complex, especially to East, West and South African coastal ports. 3 India and Sri Lanka contributed greatly to the exchange of Trade Wind beads though it has been disputed whether these countries also partook in the primary production of glass used for such beads. The mineral soda-alumina (abbreviated m-Na-Al or mNa) chemical composition of most Trade Wind Beads found in Sub-Saharan regions suggests a connection to the mineral-soda sources and alumina rich sand ubiquitous in India; however, there is no archaeological evidence to support this hypothesis to date.3 Other analysts propose a Middle Eastern, Venetian and/or Portuguese origin for the Trade Wind beads found in Sub-Saharan regions.\n\nEuropean nations became increasingly involved in the glass bead trade with Africa which consequently aided in the foreign exploitation of natural resources, including slaves. Because Westerners viewed Africans as “the uncivilised of the World,”7 glass beads known crudely as “slave beads” were commonly exchanged for human cargo which could then be shipped and traded for other desired goods. The residual effects from the glass bead trade had dramatically varying results across Sub-Saharan Africa. While most regions suffered economic and social hardship due to abusive foreign monopolies, some nations prospered from this interaction. Coastal ports serving as initial points of contact often benefited from access to imported goods, reaping profits from their own subsequent distribution to regions inland. Scholars have suggested that the rise of Empires in Ghana and Mali between the 8th-13th centuries, as well as the Kingdoms of Benin and Akan during the 16th century are intrinsically related to the access and distribution of foreign glass beads. 3 5\n\nPrimary glass production involves the combination of the raw materials Soda, Lime and Silica, heated at specific temperatures in order to produce a basic glass compound (see Glass and Anglo-Saxon Glass). Traditionally, glass has been made from either the mixture of ground quartz stones (providing the silica) and plant ash (supplying the soda and lime elements); or, by utilizing sand as a silica and lime source and then adding a chemical natron for the remaining soda needed. The production of primary glass has seen much variation throughout its history, each region slightly altering the chemical composition to better suit its particularly environmental and cultural needs (i.e. adding various fluxes/chemical additives in order to lower the required melting temperature). The addition of mineral deposits to alter the colour of glass can be carried out in the primary stage or can be added in later stages of production. The secondary production of glass typically involves processes of colouring, remelting, shaping and decorating of the glass object. While some archaeological evidence suggests the concurrence of both primary and secondary glass production at the same site, in the case of glass beads these processes often occurred separately. As access to premade glass and foreign colorants increased, beadmaking from imported goods developed into a technology which could be conducted in virtually any location across the globe.10\n\nThe production of beads from imported glass shards, cullet (scraps) and undesired glass beads has a lively presence in Sub-Saharan history. Imported glass was either formed by melting such imported glass, potentially adding desired colorants, and then shaping the melt into a bead form; or, by grinding down the imported glass to form a powder which would then be shaped, heated and cooled. The archaeological evidence of beadworking in Sub-Saharan Africa provides examples of both types.5 9 \n\nWith melted glass working, beads found were generally formed by either a wound, drawn or moulded process. Wound glass beads, also known as Tubular, Cylindrical, Spherical or Melon-Shaped, were formed by folding molten glass around a metal rod called a mandrel. Once the glass had cooled slightly, the material was slipped off the mandrel and pinched and prodded until it reached a desired shape.9\n\nAlso known as Cane beads, Drawn beads were formed by dipping an iron blowpipe into molten glass and slightly blowing air through the pipe, allowing for a “gather,” or hollow glass ball, to form at the end. A rod called a ‘puntil’ was used to pull the gather into a longer, hollow form which would then cool and be broken into individual beads. As glassblowing technology did not exist in early Sub-Saharan African regions, locally produced drawn beads were made by trapping air bubbles in molten glass and then drawing the glass into a cane form.8\n\nLittle evidence of beads produced from moulds are found in Sub-Saharan Africa, however it is understood that beads of this form were produced by dropping molten glass into a preformed open clay mould and then “punched” with a core to take on the mould’s form. Holes could then be drilled through moulded beads or, beads produced from half moulds could then be adhered together.9\n\nThe glass beads of Sub-Saharan Africa that were not melted from pre-existing glass material were instead formed by grinding glass into a fine powder to be worked further. Sources for such glass included scraps from broken glass bottles, cullets (recycled glass) or pre-existing glass beads which were no longer wanted. The grinding process generally caused colouring to be lost; therefore, various pigments were often added at this stage (see the colouring section below). After the desired colour was achieved, powdered glass was either worked in its dry form or was wetted with water or saliva to create a paste. This paste was next formed by hand into various bead shapes. Powder Glass Beads were then heated, allowed to cool and finally, polished.8 Garden Roller beads, such as the Bodom beads of Ghana.8 were the earliest form of powder glass beads found, made by threading glass in a mould with a mandrel. This process was extremely labour-intensive and expensive as the mould used was unable to be reused.8 More common were the Kiffa beads, typically associated with Mauritania. These beads were produced from the wet-form of powder glass production, and have been found since the 8th century. The paste produced in wet-form production was shaped into a bead using frames typically made of leaves of grass and then were decorated and coloured using a needle.8\n\nThough technically made from glass, the lapidary style of bead production is more akin to stone working than proper glass manufacturing. This process involved the recycling of imported glass by chipping, knapping, drilling and polishing pieces to a desired bead form. Evidence from areas outside of Ile-Ife, Nigeria suggests that individuals scavenged for discarded glass remains from earlier burial sites at Olokun Grove. Glass remains that had been brought to the upper soil layers (either naturally or via “mining”) were collected and worked to produce new glass beads.4\n\nColouring of glass could either be achieved by adding bits of pre-existing coloured glass, such as bottle shards or beads, by adding scrap metals, or by adding mineral pigments directly.9 The beads found in Sub-Saharan Africa generally contained the following pigment sources: Red was achieved by adding small amounts of metallic copper. The presence of Iron could also produce a red colour, as well as form green and brown tones.3 When copper was present and cooled in an oxidizing atmosphere (i.e. great exposure to oxygen) glass could achieve a blue-green colour. To get a clear blue colour cobalt was often used.3 To produce a purple colour manganese was added, and in the right environments manganese was also used as a decolouring agent. Yellow and opaque white were created by the addition of antimony and lead or tin and lead and if a stronger orange colour was desired zinc was then added as well. While the colouring of imported glass certainly took place in local Sub-Saharan beadworking sites, this does not imply that the minerals utilized came from local sources. Many glass pigments were most likely imported from abroad to Sub-Saharan beadworking sites.3\n\nArchaeological evidence, coupled with historical documentation and oral tradition provide evidence of numerous Sub-Saharan beadmaking sites. Found Nupe beads from Nigeria suggest native individuals produced beads from scrap glass and bottles. Remains from the Ashanti region in Ghana imply beadmaking from moulds using imported powdered glass. Sites such as Gao, Mali and Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria provide evidence for the production of Carnelian Bead. It is not known whether the Carnelian was a local material; however, bead production has been confirmed due to the discovery of lumps of imported raw glass and other glassworking equipment.5 Mapungbwe, South Africa provides another example of beadmaking. This site dates between 600-1200AD and contains evidence of glass working from pulverized bottles, ingots and other beads.\n\nThe most conclusive archaeological evidence for the primary production of glass in Sub-Saharan Africa comes from Ile-Ife, Nigeria, though finds in Gao, Mali, Benin and Ghana also support such inferences.4 Crucibles with glass layering and exterior vitrification indicative of production from raw materials prompted further compositional analysis. Archaeologist concluded that the glass found in the crucibles of Ile-Ife had a uniquely high percentage of lime and alumina compounds,4 a glass formula known only to exist in Korea. Importation of glass from Korea can be ruled out as this area only produced small quantities of glass, supplies no evidence of glass bead production and mainly only experimented with glazing.4 European, Middle Eastern, Indian and Chinese origins for the glass found at Ile-Ife can also be excluded as none of these traditions produced glass high in both lime and alumina.4 It has been suggested that this unique high-lime, high alumina glass could represent an entirely new glass making technology6 in which the alkali (soda) and alumina were derived from separate mineral sources. The lime source would also have been added separately; most probably in the form of limestone, marble or shell.6 These proposed sources for lime, native to Nigeria and other Sub-Saharan regions, comprise a novel yet plausible primary production process. Neighbouring areas, such as the sites at Ita Yemoo and Igbo-Ukwu, contain glass working evidence such as crucibles, cullets, and beads, all with high-lime, high-alumina glass compositions suggesting the secondary production of glass imported from Ile-Ife.4 Whether primary production technology was learned and transferred from abroad or locally invented is unknown. Most reasonably, the presence of imported glass beads pre-existed primary production technology which was later developed through processes of trial and error.4 6 The invention of glass distinctive to Sub-Saharan Africa could have been spurred due to a shortage of imported glass beads as material accessibility and supply often directed the course of glass production technology throughout the course of history (See History of Glass).\n\n\n"}

Image restoration theory can be applied as an approach for understanding personal or organizational crisis situations.\n\nBenoit outlines this theory in \"Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies: A Theory of Image Restoration Strategies\".\n\nTwo components must be present in a given attack to the image of an individual or organization: \n\nImage restoration theory is grounded in two fundamental assumptions.\n\n\nPerception is fundamental to image restoration, as the accused actor will not engage in a defensive strategy unless the perception exists that he is at fault. The actor who committed the wrongful act must decide on the strategy of best course based on their specific situation. Factors such as credibility, audience perceptions, and the degree of offensiveness of the act must be taken into account.\n\nThe theory of image restoration builds upon theories of apologia and accounts. Apologia is a formal defense or justification of an individual’s opinion, position, or actions, and an account is a statement made by an individual or organization to explain unanticipated or transgressive events.\n\nBenoit claims that these treatments of image restoration focus on identifying options rather than prescribing solutions. He grounds image restoration theory on a comprehensive literature review of apologia and accounts theories.\n\nSpecific influences of image restoration theory include Rosenfield’s (1968) theory of analog, Ware and Linkugel's (1973) theory of apologia; Kenneth Burke's (1970) theory of goals and purification; Ryan's (1982) kategoria and apologia; Scott and Lyman's (1968) analysis of accounts; Goffman’s (1967) remedial moves; Schonbach's (1980) updated analysis of Scott and Lyman’s (1968) theory; and Schlenker’s (1980) analysis of impression management and accounts.\n\nBased on several case studies by Benoit and his colleagues, Coombs (2006) cited a number of prescriptive recommendations for the use of crisis strategies (Benoit, 1995; Brinson & Benoit, 1996, 1999). 1) The dominant recommendation is for an organization to immediately admit fault/accept responsibility, 2) Corrective actions should be taken and an organization need to publicize those actions, 3) Bolstering, which is directly related to the charge, is the most effective strategy, and 4) If the organization was innocent, Denial is an effective strategy. “Image restoration theory is the dominant line of research generating these recommendations. The most common recommendations suggest using the mortification and corrective action crisis response when an organization is guilty.” (Coombs, 2006, p. 191)\n\nHere representative case studies by Benoit and his colleagues are introduced.\n\nEven though image restoration theory represented the use of mortification (accepting responsibility) and corrective action, there might be alternative recommendation. For instance, his studies using situational crisis communication theory found no support for always using mortification and corrective action. Also, the mortification and corrective action strategies had no greater effect than a simple bolstering strategy in a criminal violation crisis such as racial discrimination (Coombs, 2006).\n\nAdditionally, in terms of the limitation of case studies in image restoration theory, Coombs (2006) argued that closer scrutiny with insights should be taken before offering strategies to crisis managers as facts. In order to gaining additional insights into the use of crisis responses, he pointed out many similar crises should be examined for patterns of strategy use and effect and “a large number of cases could be coded and subjected to loglinear analysis in order to identify patterns.” (Coombs, 2006, p. 191-192)\n\nCoca-Cola and Pepsi’s longstanding competition reached its peak when Coke and Pepsi placed advertisements in Nation’s Restaurant News with unmistakable attacks from both sides.\n\nBenoit analyses advertisements from both companies from 1990-1992 to address the persuasive strategies of Coke and Pepsi to determine recommendations for image restoration following an attack. He advises that companies should avoid making false claims, provide adequate support for claims, and develop themes throughout a campaign, and avoid arguments that might backfire.\n\n"}

He was formerly the auxiliary bishop of Manhattan. He is a Slavist, theologian and polyglot, adherent of the Western Rite Orthodoxy.\n\nJohn Robert Shaw was born on December 21, 1946, and grew up in a small New England town. He came of an old American family, of \"Anglo\" ancestry, and was raised in the Episcopal Church. Interested in languages from an early age, he began learning Russian and Greek from the time he was 14.\n\nAt first, he did not see the connection between these languages and religion, but as he became more curious about Anglicanism, he came to believe that just as the Church of England had broken away from Rome, so in turn had the Roman Catholic Church originated as one of the Orthodox patriarchates but separated and made changes in its teachings.\n\nFrom age 16, his curiosity about these things began to turn into a serious quest for the \"true church\". That year, he began immersing himself in everything he could read about Orthodox Christianity and discovered that one of his schoolmates, Dmitry Rimsky, was of Russian Orthodox background. Rimsky's father, Fyodor Rimsky, was a parishioner of the Synodal Cathedral of Our Lady of the Sign in Manhattan, and although he did not attend services too often, he recommended the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia to Shaw and promised to take him there the next time he went.\n\nThen, on April 6, 1963 (which was Lazarus Saturday that year), Shaw made a visit to the chapel of St. Sergius in Southbury Connecticut and met Dmitry Alexandrow (the future Bishop Daniel of Erie) who took him that evening to the Night Vigil service in New Kursk-Root Icon Hermitage, Mahopac, New York. That first experience of Orthodox worship made a lasting impression.\n\nShaw spent that summer in Greece, staying with the Yiannouzis family in a suburb of Athens and, surrounded there by the Orthodox Church, made a firm decision to embrace Orthodox Christianity as soon as possible.\n\nAfter attending Russian Orthodox services for most of that year, Shaw was received into the Orthodox Church by chrismation on the day after he turned seventeen, December 22, 1963.\n\nRd. Dmitry Alexandrow was away from Southbury for some time, working with the newly arrived Old Believer Cossacks who had emigrated from Turkey, and John was received into the Orthodox Church by the Very Rev. Fr. Michael B. Draovitch, of Waterbury, Connecticut.\n\nFor a few months, John attended St. Mary's Russian Orthodox Church in Waterbury, Connecticut, but was soon involved again in ROCOR, and has remained a ROCOR member ever since.\n\nAfter graduation from high school, Shaw studied at the University of Pittsburgh, majoring in Russian linguistics, with a minor in East European history. He graduated \"cum laude\" in 1968 and entered Holy Trinity Seminary in Jordanville, New York, where his classmates included the future Bishop Peter (Loukianoff)of Cleveland, Fr. Alexander Lebedeff, Fr. Stefan Pavlenko, Fr. Vitaly Kichakov, Bro. Adam Krotov and others. As a seminarian, Shaw's \"obedience\" was at the linotype. He was tonsured a reader on September 27, 1970, by Archbishop Averky.\n\nAfter graduation from Jordanville in the class of 1971, Shaw served as a helper, translator, subdeacon and chauffeur to Archbishop Nikon (Rklitski) and, on the recommendation of his father-confessor, Archimandrite Cyprian (Pyzhov), was ordained to the subdiaconate, diaconate (April 11, 1976) and priesthood (April 25, 1976) by Archbishop Nikon. He was assigned to St. Vladimir Memorial Church, in Jackson New Jersey.\n\nOn September 4, 1976, Archbishop Nikon suddenly died and Shaw was reassigned at the request of Archbishop Seraphim (Ivanov) to Holy Virgin Protection Cathedral in Chicago, Illinois where he served from November 1976 until March 1991. On the feast of the Ascension in 1984, Shaw was elevated to the rank of archpriest.\n\nThen, when a priest was suddenly needed at Holy Trinity Church in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Archbishop Alypy (Gramanovich) (who had succeeded Archbishop Seraphim) assigned Shaw to that parish, where he served from March 17, 1991, to November 30, 2008.\n\nDuring that period, Shaw also translated two books from Russian into English: Vladyka Alypy's Slavonic textbook, which is now published in both Russian and English editions by Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, and Monk Mitrophan's \"How Our Departed Ones Live\", which was published in both languages by the efforts of Fr. Stefan Pavlenko and his parishioners in Burlingame, California.\n\nShaw was one of the delegates to the 4th All-Diaspora Sobor in 2006, and was a member of the delegation to Russia in 2007, for the restoration of communion between ROCOR and the Moscow Patriarchate.\n\nOn May 13, 2008, Shaw was asked by the newly elected Metropolitan Hilarion (Kapral) to serve as Bishop of Manhattan. After this On May 15, 2008, the Council of Bishops of the ROCOR decreed to send the curricula vitae of archimandrite George (Schaefer) and protopriest John Shaw along with accompanying appeals to Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow and All Russia for the confirmation of their candidacies for episcopal consecration. The Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church confirmed their election (together with previously elected archimandrite Theodosius (Ivashchenko)) in June 23, 2008.\n\nShaw was tonsured a monk at Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville on December 5, 2008, by Bishop John (Bērziņš), and given the name Jerome in honor of Saint Jerome of Stridonium because of their common multi-lingual talents and translation efforts.\n\nShaw was elevated to the rank of an archimandrite by Bishop Peter (Loukianoff) of Cleveland on December 7, 2008, and consecrated Bishop of Manhattan on December 10, 2008, in the Synodal Cathedral of Our Lady of the Sign, on December 10 of the same year.\n\nApril 11, 2011, \"in consideration of his diligent service ... and in connection with the 35th anniversary of entering the priesthood\", Shaw was awarded a commemorative panagia.\n\nOn May 18, 2011, a vicariate was established for the parishes adhering to the Western rite. Shaw was appointed an assistant of the First Hierarch in management of these communities.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, an extraordinary session of the Synod of Bishops of ROCOR censured Shaw \"for his willfulness in administering the parishes adhering to the Western Rite, and in performing various ecclesiastical services not approved by the Synod of Bishops, and for criticizing his brethren in letters to clergy and laity\", relieved him of all duties, and retired him.\n\n\n"}

He has also conducted his own opera \"Jaakko Ilkka\" at the Finnish National Opera.\n\nPanula has served as Professor of Conducting at the Sibelius Academy in Helsinki from 1973 to 1994 and at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm and the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen. \n\nAs a pedagogue, Panula has been a teacher and mentor to many Finnish conductors, including Esa-Pekka Salonen, Mikko Franck, Sakari Oramo, Jukka-Pekka Saraste, and Osmo Vänskä. \n\nHe has taught conducting courses all over the world, such as in Paris, London, Amsterdam, Moscow, New York, Tanglewood, Aspen, Ottawa and Sydney. He has limited his podium appearances greatly during the past ten years. Panula was listed as one of the \"60 most powerful people in music\" featured in the November 2000 issue of \"BBC Music Magazine\". Panula was awarded the Rolf Schock Prize in 1997. He conducted the Helsinki City Symphony Orchestra in the première in December 1971 of the first symphony by Aulis Sallinen.\n\nIn March 2014, Panula caused controversy in a Finnish television interview with remarks that denigrated the ability of women to conduct particular composers, and that women were suited to conducting music that was \"feminine enough\", such as Debussy, but that they were unsuited for conducting Bruckner. He stated that \"women [conductors]… Of course they are trying! Some of them are making faces, sweating and fussing, but it is not getting any better – only worse!... It’s not a problem – if they choose the right pieces. If they take more feminine music... This is a purely biological question.” Other conductors, such as his former student Salonen, responded critically to Panula's remarks.\n"}

{"id": "1151672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1151672", "title": "Killer7", "text": "Killer7\n\nKiller7 is a 2005 action-adventure video game for the GameCube and PlayStation 2, developed by Grasshopper Manufacture and published by Capcom. The game was written and directed by Goichi Suda, also known by the nickname Suda51, and produced by Hiroyuki Kobayashi.\n\nThe game follows an elite group of assassins called the \"killer7\". The assassins, physical manifestations of a man named Harman Smith, perform hits on behalf of the United States government. Through these missions, the killer7 uncover a deeper conspiracy regarding the role of Japan in U.S. politics and secrets about the nature of their organization. \"Killer7\" features first-person shooter elements and a unique on rails control scheme, but the core adventure-style gameplay has been compared to \"Myst\" and \"Snatcher\".\n\n\"Killer7\" was Suda51's first game released outside Japan. It received polarized reviews due to its unconventional control scheme, linear gameplay, and complex noir plot. While some reviewers appreciated the stripped-down controls and stylized arthouse approach, others panned it as confusing and restricting. However, the game's soundtrack, presentation, visual style and thought-provoking story received generally positive responses from critics and considered as the best aspects of the game and lead to several accolades and nominations. Despite these setbacks, \"Killer7\"s cult appeal led to remakes of Suda51's older works, a remastered version of \"Killer7\" for Microsoft Windows released in 2018, and the successful launch of \"No More Heroes\".\n\nThe player controls the on-screen character, a member of the killer7 group, from a third-person view using the gamepad. The gameplay consists of elements of first-person shooter and action-adventure game with restricted movement (i.e. \"on rails\")—rather than allow free motion, the game limits the on-screen character to predetermined paths through the environment. The on-screen character moves forward by holding a button and reverses direction with another button press. At intersections, the player may choose which path to take. Progress is made by navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Some puzzles require the talents of a specific killer7 member. The player may switch between available members via a menu in the pause screen at any time; not all personalities may be awake at a start of a mission, and requires defeating a number of enemies before they can be awakened. Other puzzles require magical rings or other items collected throughout the game.\n\nCombat in \"Killer7\" occurs when the player encounters enemies called \"Heaven Smiles\". Smiles announce their presence with a laughing sound effect and are initially invisible. The player must switch to a first-person viewpoint and scan the surroundings to reveal Smiles. While in first-person view, movement is disabled and the analog stick aims the character's gun. Targeting specific body parts will disable them; for example, shooting off a leg will cause a Smile to fall to the ground and crawl toward the player. The player may aim for a \"critical point\" that instantly destroys the Smile. Smiles that get too close will explode and injure the character. If a character dies, players can use Garcian Smith to retrieve the fallen character's head and bring them back to life; if Garcian dies, then the game ends.\n\nDefeated Smiles yield \"thick blood\" and \"thin blood\". Thick blood functions similarly to experience points, and players gain more by shooting Smiles' critical points. The player may redeem thick blood for \"serum\" while in \"Harman's Room\", checkpoints that appear throughout the game. Serum is used to improve the attributes of the characters such as \"power\" and \"speed\". This also unlocks special abilities for the characters. Players may save their game to a memory card in designated Harman's Rooms. Thin blood is used to recover the characters' stamina and fuel special abilities.\n\nCompleting the game unlocks another character, \"Young Harman\", together with another level, \"Killer8\". Completing Killer8 unlocks \"Hopper7\".\n\n\"Killer7\" takes place in an alternate version of Earth in the early 21st century. After a treaty ends all international conflict, the world powers destroy all nuclear weapons by firing them into the upper atmosphere and intercepting them with other missiles. This event becomes known as \"Fireworks\" and symbolizes world peace to the general populace. In an effort to combat terrorism, pandemic disease, and cyberterrorism, the International Ethics Committee (IEC) shuts down all air travel and public use of the Internet. Air transportation is replaced by a system of intercontinental expressways. However, a new terrorist group called \"Heaven Smile\" appears, targeting the United Nations (UN) and IEC. The members of Heaven Smile are humans who have been infected with a virus that evokes a desire to kill. Factory-produced Smiles are given a \"bomb-organ\" that allows them to explode at will, their principal means of attack.\n\nIn this Earth, Japanese politics are dominated by two parties: the UN Party and the Liberal Party. The UN Party is more powerful and moves to end the Asian Security Treaty and sever ties with the United States (US). The UN Party seized control of the Japanese government through the wisdom of the \"Yakumo Cabinet Policy\", a secret document which details how to run the \"ideal nation\". It was written by the Union 7, young members of the Liberal Party who went on to found the UN Party. The US government is also eager to sever relations with Japan, seeing the country as a hindrance and of little economic value. The interaction between Japan and the US is a central source of conflict in \"Killer7\".\n\nThe player controls the members of a group of assassins called the \"killer7\". The group is led by an elderly man in a wheelchair named Harman Smith, who exhibits \"Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon\". This condition allows him to physically transform into one of his seven assassin personae: African American Garcian Smith, aggressive Irish American Dan Smith, barefoot Japanese American female KAEDE Smith, albino Briton Kevin Smith, Puerto Rican Coyote Smith, young Chinese American Con Smith, and Mexican American luchador MASK de Smith. These people were gifted killers in life and Harman absorbed their souls through his condition after their deaths. The killer7 were temporarily incapacitated in an incident 50 years ago, in which the members of the group were systematically tracked and killed while performing a job at the Union Hotel in Pennsylvania. Garcian, whose power is to revive fallen personae, became the dominant personality as a result. In this capacity, he receives orders from the frail Harman when his consciousness is \"awake\" and accepts jobs from Christopher Mills, who hires the killer7 on behalf of the US government. Multifoliate Personae Phenomenon also causes Harman and his personae to see \"remnant psyches\"—ghosts of their past victims. Iwazaru, a man in a bondage suit, and Travis Bell, the killer7's first target, are the main remnant psyches who aid them throughout the game. The primary antagonist is an old friend of Harman's named Kun Lan. He has the \"Hand of God\", a supernatural power that produces the Heaven Smile virus.\n\nThe game opens with a conversation between Garcian Smith and Christopher Mills about a new job for the killer7. The assassins battle their way to the top of a building which has become infested with Heaven Smiles. Harman confronts the source of the Smiles, an angel-like figure, but she is merely Kun Lan's puppet. Harman and Kun Lan discuss the current state of the world before the mission ends. In the subsequent missions, the killer7 target a number of individuals on behalf of the US government or for personal reasons. They kill Andrei Ulmeyda, a Texan postal worker who established a successful company based on the Yakumo, when he becomes infected with the Heaven Smile virus. Dan Smith confronts Curtis Blackburn, his former mentor and murderer, when Mills informs the group that Blackburn is running an organ trafficking business that targets young girls. Their penultimate mission pits them against the \"Handsome Men\", a group of sentai rangers who assassinate a US politician.\n\nThe central plot arc concerns the true nature of US–Japan relations. After a volley of two hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles are fired at Japan, the US government contracts the killer7 to eliminate Toru Fukushima, the head of the UN Party. However, an assassin posing as Fukushima's secretary kills him first in an attempt to reclaim the Yakumo document for the Liberal Party, believing its wisdom would help the party to regain political power. Shortly thereafter, Kenjiro Matsuoka (nicknamed \"Matsuken\") kills two senior members of the UN Party to become its new leader, under the influence of Kun Lan. In the end, the killer7 defeat the two UN Party members who had been reanimated by Kun Lan as Japan is destroyed by the missiles.\n\nIn their final mission, the killer7 seek Matsuken, who leads the 10 million UN Party members who live in the US. The government fears that if they converge on a single state, they could win a seat in the United States Senate. Garcian travels to Coburn Elementary School near Seattle, Washington and discovers tapes that reveal the school as a front for the UN Party to train children as assassins. The tapes focus on Emir Parkreiner, a gifted killer trained at the school. Garcian learns that Japan uses Coburn to control the vote of the US presidential election. The assassins battle a group of invincible Smiles and all but Garcian are incapacitated. Garcian travels to the Union Hotel where he witnesses visions of the other members being killed in their rooms. At the top, he discovers that his true identity is Emir Parkreiner, the one who killed the killer7 at the Union Hotel over 50 years ago. Following that incident, Harman absorbed Emir as a persona and Emir's memories were lost.\n\nThree years later, Garcian arrives at Battleship Island in Japan to destroy the last Heaven Smile. He meets with Matsuken, who presents Garcian with a choice: let him live, which allows Japan to mount an assault on the US; or kill him, which lets the US discover Japan's role in rigging American elections—US forces destroy Japan's last stronghold, Battleship Island, in retaliation and wipe Japan off the map. Regardless of the player's choice, Garcian finds that the last Heaven Smile is Iwazaru, whose real identity is Kun Lan, and kills him. However, Harman and Kun Lan are revealed to be immortal beings, representing a dialectic struggle between opposites, which persists a century in the future in Shanghai as they continue their eternal battle.\n\nDevelopment for \"Killer7\" began in mid-2002 as part of the Capcom Five, a set of games overseen by Shinji Mikami and intended to be exclusive to the GameCube. Capcom produced the games to bring new intellectual property to the video game industry, which the company viewed as stagnant. \"Killer7\"s gameplay mechanics were finalized late in development because most resources went to story and visual work. Director Suda51 wrote the scenario based on a plot he conceived together with Mikami, and later decided on the unconventional control scheme as a deconstruction of how gamers play and to \"create new expression\". Complex controls and combos were omitted to present a system that fosters easy progression for the player. Producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi described the controls as \"intuitive\" and stated that the team wanted players to \"think when they are playing\" so they can enjoy the mystery in the story. The long development process culminated in several delays, the last of which was due to an artistic desire to release the game on July 7 (7/7).\n\nSuda51 drew influence from film noir, particularly the theme of multiple personality disorder, and called \"Killer7\" a \"hardboiled action-adventure\". Hiro Sugiyama, Peter Saville, and American comic book artists, such as Adrian Tomine, inspired the artistic design and aesthetic. Suda51 noted the inclusion of cel animation in Western and Japanese anime styles was meant to legitimize video games as an art form by competing with traditional art forms in their stage. The game's anime sequences were created by Xebec, while the CGI sequences were handled by Digital Frontier. Kobayashi commented that \"Killer7\" is \"styled more as an interactive story than a traditional game.\" Suda also drew from yakuza film \"\". His experience as an undertaker had a powerful effect on the portrayal of death in his games. The game reflects his interest in professional wrestling; Suda51 included a luchador character, MASK de Smith, and conducted interviews and attended promotional events while wearing a lucha libre mask. Reflecting on his work, Suda51 considers \"Killer7\" his proudest achievement.\n\n\"Killer7\" received divisive reviews and sparked debates about depictions of sex and violence in video games and the status of video games as art. James Mielke of 1UP.com likened the game's high-contrast art style to noir and neo-noir film such as \"Se7en\". He found that despite poor pacing and stilted gameplay, the \"quirky scripting and edgy plot\" were strong draws, and called \"Killer7\" one of the \"most artfully designed footnotes in gaming history\". \"Edge\" magazine's reviewers echoed this sentiment and predicted that the game would \"[pave the way] for future creative leeway\", crediting the director with an unwavering artistic vision. Eurogamer's Kristan Reed was keenly aware of the game's limited appeal, calling it \"a concept game, an arthouse game, a simple game, an often beautiful game, but most certainly never an everyman's game\". Yahtzee Croshaw of \"The Escapist\" commends the game for \"showing exactly what can be done when you flaunt all established convention and just start exploring what can really be done with gaming as an art form\".\n\nVirtually all aspects of the game had their proponents and detractors. Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the unity of \"great-looking camera work with simple controls\" and compared its \"thought-provoking\" storyline to \"Metal Gear Solid\", while a \"GamePro\" reviewer criticized those features, calling the controls limited, the cel-shading dull, and the story incoherent. Kasavin complimented the game's eclectic soundtrack, excellent voice acting, and distinctive sound effects, while the \"GamePro\" reviewer panned them as minimalist and irritating. IGN's Matt Casamassina likened the control scheme to \"old-school adventure games like \"Myst\" and \"Snatcher\"\" and commended Suda51 for making a \"cult hit\", \"erupting with style, mood and undiluted craziness\". Casamassina was also impressed by the quality of the anime-style cutscenes featured in the latter half of the game.\n\nThe IGN, GameSpot, and GameSpy reviews noted the GameCube version features superior graphics, substantially faster loading times, and more responsive controls than the PlayStation 2 version, resulting in lower scores for the latter. Nevertheless, IGN called it the 94th best PlayStation 2 game. \"Nintendo Power\" claimed that \"Killer7\" is a \"highly rewarding\" experience for dedicated gamers. Nintendo World Report writer Karl Castaneda also remarked that, despite repetitive gameplay, it was \"\"still\" fun\". Charles Herold of \"The New York Times\" was less forgiving and commented that the lack of new features beyond the first hour made the remaining experience boring and annoying.\n\nDespite its mixed reception, a number of video game publications recognized \"Killer7\"s unconventional gameplay and innovative style. At GameSpot's \"Best and Worst of 2005\" awards, the game was nominated for Best Story, Best GameCube Game, Most Outrageous Game, Most Gratuitous Use of F------ Swearing, and won Best New Character (Harman Smith) and Most Innovative Game. IGN similarly nominated it for Game of the Year, Most Innovative Design, and Best Artistic Design and awarded it Best Adventure Game, Best Story, and Best Game No One Played. IGN later named \"Killer7\" the 20th best GameCube game of all time. The game had a large presence at the 2005 \"Nintendo Power\" Awards, winning Best New Character (Harman Smith).\n\nIn August 2005, Jack Thompson, an activist who campaigns against video games, demanded that the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) change its rating for \"Killer7\" from \"M\" (for Mature, ages 17 and up) to \"AO\" (for Adults Only, ages 18 and up). He cited Casamassina's review of the game at IGN, claiming that \"full-blown sex sequences\" present in the game would be harmful to minors. Casamassina rebutted that the scene in question involved two fully clothed adults and that a similar scene in a film would garner \"only a PG-13 or, worst, R-rating\".\n\nReviewers quickly identified \"Killer7\" as a cult game with limited appeal. IGN lamented that its experimental style was not conducive to high sales, naming it GameCube's Best Game No One Played in their 2005 awards. IGN's Casamassina later placed it fourth in his \"Top 10 Tuesday: Underrated and Underappreciated Games\" feature. Despite modest sales, \"Killer7\"s cult success prompted the development of remakes of Suda51's older Japan-only games, \"The Silver Case\" and \"Flower, Sun, and Rain\". In 2007, Grasshopper Manufacture released Suda51's \"No More Heroes\" to critical and commercial success. In addition to an original soundtrack and comic book adaptation, Capcom published \"Hand in killer7\", a companion book that explains the plot in more depth. Kinetic Underground, the company that handled the comic book, also released a number of figurines depicting characters from the game.\n\n\"Killer7 Original Sound Track\" was released on June 20, 2005 by Sony Music Entertainment. It features 55 compositions by Masafumi Takada and 6 by Jun Fukuda across two discs. Takada put a large emphasis on ambient music due to the genre's ability to draw in the player. He called his soundtrack a \"translation of the text\" of the game and sought to retell the story through music. Carolyn Gudmundson of GamesRadar praised the soundtrack's varied style, a \"moody, atmosphereric base punctuated with spikes of manic energy\". She singled out \"Rave On\", a track heard before mini-boss battles, as an excellent example of the latter. GameSpy's Phil Theobald had similar compliments for \"Rave On\" and other more subdued pieces that slowly \"work [their] way into your mind\".\n\nTakada said in a 2008 interview that \"Killer7\" is his favourite own soundtrack.\n\nTrack list\n\nIn 2006, Devil's Due Publishing released a comic book adaptation of \"Killer7\", written and drawn by Kinetic Underground staff. The planned 12-issue limited series was cancelled after four issues. Players who preordered \"Killer7\" through EB Games received a special \"Issue #0\" as a bonus, and \"Issue #½\" was available at the 2005 San Diego Comic-Con. Writer Arvid Nelson described the story as a \"mutant cross-breeding of John Woo and Quentin Tarantino\", and Devil's Due President Josh Blaylock commented that \"Killer7\"s style was perfect for the comic book medium. In adapting the game, Nelson admitted that the plot was streamlined to maintain a comprehensible story, but noted that the \"video game doesn't spoon-feed you information ... That's how the comic's going to be, too\".\n\nSince its inception, fans have been anticipating a \"Killer7\" sequel. Suda made it clear that it will \"probably never happen\" as Capcom holds the rights to the IP. In a 2010 interview, he exclaimed that \"Killer7\" is \"part of his soul\" and is certainly interested in making a sequel.\n\nIn 2012, Suda revealed a new game titled \"Killer Is Dead\"; word quickly spread that it was a follow-up to \"Killer7\" since the game shares similar concept with an assassin protagonist, complex plot and cel-shaded graphics. Suda later clarified that \"Killer Is Dead\" is an original game and has no relation to \"Killer7\".\n\nDuring a panel at 2016's PAX East, Suda expressed his interest to remaster \"Killer7\" and has begun talks with the game's publisher, Capcom. On March 17 2018, during \"HOPPER'S Vol. 5\" an event celebrating Grasshopper Manufacture's 20th anniversary, Suda verbally announced to attendees that there are plans to remaster both \"Killer7\" and \"Flower, Sun, and Rain.\" However no platform or release date was mentioned. Suda later posted on his Twitter account stating that the \"Killer7\" remaster will be out within 10 years. At the 2018 MomoCon, Suda announced that a remastered version of \"Killer7\" for Microsoft Windows which was released on November 15, 2018.\n\n"}

{"id": "229136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=229136", "title": "Linguistic prescription", "text": "Linguistic prescription\n\nLinguistic prescription, or prescriptive grammar, is the attempt to lay down rules defining preferred or \"correct\" use of language. These rules may address such linguistic aspects as spelling, pronunciation, vocabulary, syntax, and semantics. Sometimes informed by linguistic purism, such normative practices may suggest that some usages are incorrect, illogical, lack communicative effect, or are of low aesthetic value. They may also include judgments on socially proper and politically correct language use.\n\nLinguistic prescriptivism may aim to establish a standard language, teach what a particular society perceives as a correct form, or advise on effective communication. If usage preferences are conservative, prescription might appear resistant to language change; if radical, it may produce neologisms.\n\nPrescriptive approaches to language are often contrasted with the descriptive approach (\"descriptivism\"), employed in academic linguistics, which observes and records how language is actually used. The basis of linguistic research is text (corpus) analysis and field study, both of which are descriptive activities. Description, however, may include researchers' observations of their own language usage.\n\nDespite being apparent opposites, prescription and description are often complementary, as comprehensive descriptive accounts must take speaker preferences into account, and an understanding of how language is actually used is necessary for prescription to be effective. Since the mid-20th century some dictionaries and style guides, which are prescriptive works by nature, have increasingly integrated descriptive material and approaches. Examples of guides updated to add more descriptive and evidence-based material include \"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\" (1961) and the third edition \"Garner's Modern English Usage\" (2009) in English, or the \"Nouveau Petit Robert\" (1993) in French. A partially descriptive approach can be especially useful when approaching topics of ongoing conflict between authorities, or in different dialects, disciplines, styles, or registers. Other guides, such as \"The Chicago Manual of Style\", are designed to impose a single style and thus remain primarily prescriptive ().\n\nSome researchers define \"prescriptivism\" as the concept where a certain language variety is promoted as linguistically superior to others, thus recognizing the standard language ideology as a requisite element of prescriptivism or even identifying prescriptivism with this doctrinal system. Others, however, use this term in relation to the prescriptive approach peculiar to language counseling and other formal norm-setting activities, without, however, implying that these practices by definition involve propagating the standard language ideology.\n\nThe chief aim of linguistic prescription can be to specify standard language forms (either generally, as in Standard English, or in style and register) in a way that is easily taught and learned. Prescription may apply to most aspects of language, including spelling, grammar, semantics, pronunciation, syntax, and register.\n\nStandardized languages are useful for inter-regional communication, allowing speakers of divergent dialects to understand a standard language used in broadcasting, for example, more readily than each other's dialects. While such a lingua franca may evolve by itself, the desire to formulate and define it is widespread in most parts of the world. Writers or communicators often adhere to prescriptive rules to make their communication clearer and more widely understood. Similarly, stability of a language over time helps one to understand writings from the past.\n\nLinguistic prescription may also be used to advance a social or political ideology. During the second half of the 20th century, efforts driven by various advocacy groups had considerable influence on language use under the broad banner of \"political correctness\", to promote special rules for anti-sexist, anti-racist, or generically anti-discriminatory language (e.g. \"people-first language\" as advocated by disability rights organizations).\n\nGeorge Orwell criticized the use of euphemisms and convoluted phrasing as a means of hiding insincerity in \"Politics and the English Language\" (1946). His fictional \"Newspeak\" (in \"1984\", written around the year 1949) is a parody of ideologically motivated linguistic prescriptivism.\n\nPrescription presupposes authorities whose judgments may come to be followed by many other speakers and writers. For English, these authorities tend to be books. H. W. Fowler's \"Modern English Usage\" was widely taken as an authority for British English for much of the 20th century; Strunk and White's \"The Elements of Style\" has done similarly for American English. The \"Duden\" grammar (first edition 1880) has a similar status for German.\n\nAlthough lexicographers often see their work as purely descriptive, dictionaries are widely regarded as prescriptive authorities. Books such as Lynne Truss's \"Eats, Shoots & Leaves\" (2003), which argues for stricter adherence to prescriptive punctuation rules, also seek to exert an influence.\n\nLinguistic prescription is imposed by regulation in some places. The \"Académie française\" in Paris is the national body in France whose recommendations about the French language are widely respected in the French-speaking world, though not legally enforceable. In Germany and the Netherlands, recent spelling reforms such as that of 1996 were devised by teams of linguists commissioned by the respective governments of German-speaking countries and then implemented by statutes. Some met with widespread dissent.\n\nExamples of national prescriptive bodies and initiatives are:\n\nOther kinds of authorities exist in specific settings, most commonly in the form of style manuals (also called style guides, manuals of style, style books, or style sheets). Style guides vary in form, and may be alphabetical usage dictionaries, comprehensive manuals divided into numerous subsection by facet of language, or very compact works insistent upon only a few matters of particular importance to the publisher. Some aim to be comprehensive only for a specific field, deferring to more general-audience guides on matters that are not particular to the discipline in question. There are different types of style guides, by purpose and audience. Because the genres of writing and the audiences of each manual are different, style manuals often conflict with each other, even within the same dialect of English.\n\nMany publishers have established an internal house style specifying preferred spellings and grammatical forms, such as serial commas, how to write acronyms, and various awkward expressions to avoid. Most of these are internal documentation for the publisher's staff, though various newspapers, universities, and other organizations have made theirs available for public inspection, and sometimes even sell them as books, e.g. \"The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage\" and \"The Economist Style Guide\".\n\nIn a few cases, an entire publishing sector complies with a publication that originated as a house style manual, such as \"The Chicago Manual of Style\" and \"New Hart's Rules\" in non-fiction book publishing in the United States and the United Kingdom, respectively, and \"The Associated Press Stylebook\" in American news style. Others are by self-appointed advocates whose rules are propagated in the popular press, as in \"proper Cantonese pronunciation\". The aforementioned Fowler, and Strunk & White, were among the self-appointed, as are some modern authors of style works, like Bryan A. Garner and his \"Modern English Usage\" (formerly \"Modern American Usage\").\n\nVarious style guides are used for academic papers and professional journals, and have become \"de facto\" standards in particular fields, though the bulk of their material pertains to formatting of source citations (in mutually conflicting ways). Some examples are those issued by the American Medical Association, the Modern Language Association, and the Modern Humanities Research Association; there are many others. \"Scientific Style and Format\", by the Council of Science Editors, seeks to normalize style in scientific journal publishing, based where possible on standards issued by bodies like the International Standards Organization.\n\nNone of these works have any sort of legal or regulatory authority (though some governments produce their own house style books for internal use). They still have authority in the sense that a student may be marked down for failure to follow a specified style manual; a professional publisher may enforce compliance; and a publication may require its employees to use house style as a matter of on-the-job competence. A well-respected style guide, and usually one intended for a general audience, may also have the kind of authority that a dictionary does, consulted as a reference work to satisfy personal curiosity or settle an argument.\n\nHistorically, linguistic prescriptivism originates in a standard language when a society establishes social stratification and a socio-economic hierarchy. The spoken and written language usages of the authorities (state, military, church) are preserved as the standard language. Departures from this standard language may jeopardise social success (see social class). Sometimes, archaisms and honorific stylizations may be deliberately introduced or preserved to distinguish the prestige form of the language from contemporary colloquial language. Likewise, the style of language used in ritual also differs from everyday speech. Special ceremonial languages known only to a select few spiritual leaders are found throughout the world; Liturgical Latin has served a similar function for centuries.\nWhen a culture develops a writing system, orthographic rules for the consistent transcription of culturally important works (laws, scriptures, contracts, poetry, etc.) allow a large number of speakers to understand written communications easily, and across multiple generations.\n\nEarly historical trends in literacy and alphabetization were closely tied to the influence of various religious institutions. Western Christianity propagated the Latin alphabet. Eastern Orthodoxy spread the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets. Judaism used the Hebrew alphabet, and Islam the Arabic alphabet. Hinduism used the Devanagari script. In certain traditions, strict adherence to prescribed spellings and pronunciations was and remains of great spiritual importance. Islamic naming conventions and greetings are notable examples of linguistic prescription being prerequisite to spiritual righteousness. Another commonly cited example of prescriptive language usage closely associated with social propriety is the system of honorific speech in Japanese.\n\nMost, if not all, widely spoken languages demonstrate some degree of social codification in how they conform to prescriptive rules. Linguistic prestige is a central research topic within sociolinguistics. Notions of linguistic prestige apply to different dialects of the same language and also to separate, distinct languages in multilingual regions. Prestige level disparity often leads to \"diglossia\": speakers in certain social contexts consciously choose a prestige language or dialect over a less prestigious one, even if it is their native tongue.\nGovernment bureaucracy tends toward prescriptivism as a means of enforcing functional continuity. Such prescriptivism dates from ancient Egypt, where bureaucrats preserved the spelling of the Middle Kingdom of Egypt into the Ptolemaic period through the standard usage of Egyptian hieroglyphics.\n\nFrom the earliest attempts at prescription in classical times grammarians have based their norms on observed prestige use of language. Modern prescriptivist textbooks draw heavily on descriptive linguistic analysis.\n\nPrescription may privilege some existing forms over others for the sake of maximizing clarity and precision in language use. Others are subjective judgments of what constitutes good taste. Some reflect the promotion of one class or region within a language community over another, which can become politically controversial.\n\nPrescription can also reflect ethical considerations, as in prohibiting swear words. Words referring to elements of sexuality or toilet hygiene may be regarded as obscene. Blasphemies against religion may be forbidden. In recent decades \"political correctness\" has had a profound censorious effect.\n\nSome elements of prescription in English are sometimes thought to have been based on the norms of Latin grammar. Robert Lowth is frequently cited as having done so, but he specifically objected to \"forcing the English under the rules of a foreign Language\". It is true that analogies with Latin were sometimes used to buttress arguments, but only in defending an accepted prestige form of English.\n\nAlthough the standardization of language has an established place in such fields as broadcasting, computer programming, and international commerce, prescriptivism is often subject to criticism. Many linguists, such as Geoffrey Pullum and other posters to Language Log, are highly skeptical of the quality of advice given in many usage guides, including highly regarded books like Strunk and White's \"Elements of Style\".\nIn particular, linguists point out that popular books on English usage written by journalists or novelists (e.g. Simon Heffer's \"Strictly English: The Correct Way to Write ... and Why It Matters\") often make basic errors in linguistic analysis.\n\nA frequent criticism is that prescription has a tendency to favour the language of one particular region or social class over others, and thus militates against linguistic diversity. Frequently, a standard dialect is associated with the upper class, for example Great Britain's Received Pronunciation (RP). RP has now lost much of its status as the Anglophone standard, and other standards are now alternative systems for English as a foreign language. Although these have a more democratic base, they still exclude large parts of the English-speaking world: speakers of Scottish English, Hiberno-English, Australian English, or African-American English may feel the standard is slanted against them. Thus prescription has political consequences. In the past, prescription was used consciously as a political tool.\n\nA second issue with prescriptivism is that prescriptive practices tend to explicitly devalue non-standard dialects. Prescriptive practices frequently come with the intention of influencing speakers to apply the proposed linguistic devices invariably, without considering the existence of different registers and styles of language. In many cases, prescriptive codification involves promoting the sanctioned language variety as the only legitimate means of communication and the only valid criterion of correctness, coupled with stigmatizing non-standard usages as \"mistakes\". Such practices might contribute to perpetuating the belief that non-codified forms of language are innately inferior or less legitimate linguistically. This popular idea, however, goes against one of the fundamental principles of modern linguistics, which holds that all forms of language, including both vernacular dialects and different realizations of a standardized variety, are scientifically equal, even if deemed socially inappropriate for certain situations. Normative practices might also give rise to the conviction that explicit formal instruction is an essential prerequisite for acquiring proper command of one's native language. Propagating such language ideologies is characteristic of normativistics in Eastern Europe, where prescriptivist ideas of correctness are predominant even among professional linguists.\n\nAnother serious issue with prescription is that prescriptive rules quickly become entrenched and it is difficult to change them when the language changes. Thus, there is a tendency for prescription to lag behind the colloquial language. In 1834, an anonymous writer advised against the split infinitive, reasoning that the construction was not a frequent feature of English as he knew it. Today the construction is in everyday use, yet the old prohibition can still be heard.\n\nA further problem is the difficulty of specifying legitimate criteria. Although prescribing authorities may have clear ideas about why they make a particular choice, and their choices are seldom entirely arbitrary, there exists no linguistically sustainable metric for ascertaining which forms of language are objectively superior or \"more correct\". Judgments that seek to resolve ambiguity or increase the ability of the language to make subtle distinctions are easier to defend. Judgments based on the subjective associations of a word are more problematic.\n\nFinally, there is the problem of inappropriate dogmatism. Although competent authorities tend to make careful statements, popular pronouncements on language are apt to condemn. Thus, wise prescriptive advice identifying a form as non-standard and suggesting that it be used with caution in some contexts may – when taken up in the classroom – become converted into a ruling that the non-standard form is automatically wrong in all circumstances, a view linguists reject. (Linguists may accept that a form is incorrect if it fails to communicate, but not simply because it diverges from a norm.) A classic example from 18th-century England is Robert Lowth's tentative suggestion that preposition stranding in relative clauses sounds colloquial. This grew into a grammatical rule that a sentence should never end with a preposition. Such dogmatism has often caused resentment.\nFor these reasons, some writers argue that linguistic prescription is foolish or futile. Samuel Johnson commented on the tendency of some prescription to resist language change:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "72715", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72715", "title": "Metonymy", "text": "Metonymy\n\nMetonymy () is a figure of speech in which a thing or concept is referred to by the name of something closely associated with that thing or concept.\n\nThe words \"metonymy\" and \"metonym\" come from the Greek , , \"a change of name\", from , , \"after, beyond\", and , , a suffix that names figures of speech, from , or , , \"name\".\n\nMetonymy and related figures of speech are common in everyday speech and writing. Synecdoche and metalepsis are considered specific types of metonymy. Polysemy, multiple meanings of a single word or phrase, sometimes results from relations of metonymy. Both metonymy and metaphor involve the substitution of one term for another. In metaphor, this substitution is based on some specific analogy between two things, whereas in metonymy the substitution is based on some understood association or contiguity.\n\nAmerican literary theorist Kenneth Burke considers metonymy as one of four \"master tropes\": metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony. He discusses them in particular ways in his book \"A Grammar of Motives\".\n\nIn addition to its use in everyday speech, metonymy is a figure of speech in some poetry and in much rhetoric. Greek and Latin scholars of rhetoric made significant contributions to the study of metonymy.\n\nSynecdoche, in which a specific part of something is used to refer to the whole, is usually understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Sometimes an absolute distinction is made between a metonymy and a synecdoche, treating metonymy as different from, rather than inclusive of, synecdoche. There is a similar problem with the terms simile and metaphor.\n\nWhen the distinction is made, it is the following: when \"A\" is used to refer to \"B\", it is a synecdoche if A is a component of B or if B is a component of A, and a metonym if A is commonly associated with B but not part of its whole or a whole of its part. Thus, \"20,000 hungry mouths to feed\" is a synecdoche because mouths (A) are a part of the people (B) referred to. \"Australia votes\" is also a synecdoche because Australia is a whole of which the people who voted are a part. On the other hand, \"The White House said\" is metonymy, but not synecdoche, for the president and his staff, because, although the White House is associated with the president and his staff, the building is not a part of the people.\n\nSimilarly, metalepsis is closely related to metonymy, and is sometimes understood as a specific kind of metonymy. Metalepsis is a figure of speech in which a word or a phrase from figurative speech is used in a new context. The new figure of speech refers to an existing one. For example, in the idiom \"lead foot\", meaning someone who drives fast, lead is a heavy substance, and a heavy foot on the accelerator pedal would cause a vehicle to go quickly. The use of \"lead foot\" to describe a person follows the intermediate substitution of \"lead\" for \"heavy\". The figure of speech is a \"metonymy of a metonymy\".\n\nThe concept of metonymy also informs the nature of polysemy, i.e., how the same phonological form (word) has different semantic mappings (meanings). If the two meanings are unrelated, as in the word \"pen\" meaning both \"writing instrument\" and \"enclosure\", they are considered homonyms. Within logical polysemies, a large class of mappings may be considered to be a case of metonymic transfer (e.g., \"chicken\" for the bird, as well as its meat; \"crown\" for the object, as well as the institution). Other cases where the meaning is polysemous, however, may turn out to be more metaphorical, e.g., \"eye\" as in the \"eye of the needle\".\n\nMetonymy works by the contiguity (association) between two concepts, whereas the term \"metaphor\" is based upon their analogous similarity. When people use metonymy, they do not typically wish to transfer qualities from one referent to another as they do with metaphor. There is nothing press-like about reporters or crown-like about a monarch, but \"the press\" and \"the crown\" are both common metonyms. Some uses of figurative language may be understood as both metonymy and metaphor; for example, the relationship between \"a crown\" and a \"king\" could be interpreted metaphorically (i.e., the king, like his gold crown, could be seemingly stiff yet ultimately malleable, over-ornate, and consistently immobile).\n\nTwo examples using the term \"fishing\" help clarify the distinction. The phrase \"to fish pearls\" uses metonymy, drawing from \"fishing\" the idea of taking things from the ocean. What is carried across from \"fishing fish\" to \"fishing pearls\" is the domain of metonymy. In contrast, the metaphorical phrase \"fishing for information\" transfers the concept of fishing into a new domain. If someone is \"fishing\" for information, we do not imagine that the person is anywhere near the ocean; rather, we transpose elements of the action of fishing (waiting, hoping to catch something that cannot be seen, probing) into a new domain (a conversation). Thus, metaphor works by presenting a target set of meanings and using them to suggest a similarity between items, actions, or events in two domains, whereas metonymy calls up or references a specific domain (here, removing items from the sea).\n\nSometimes, metaphor and metonymy may both be at work in the same figure of speech, or one could interpret a phrase metaphorically or metonymically. For example, the phrase \"lend me your ear\" could be analyzed in a number of ways. One could imagine the following interpretations:\n\n\nIt is difficult to say which analyses above most closely represents the way a listener interprets the expression, and it is possible that different listeners analyse the phrase in different ways, or even in different ways at different times. Regardless, all three analyses yield the same interpretation. Thus, metaphor and metonymy, though different in their mechanism, work together seamlessly.\n\nHere are some broad kinds of relationships where metonymy is frequently used:\n\nA place is often used as a metonym for a government or other official institutions, for example, Brussels for the institutions of the European Union, The Hague for the International Court of Justice or International Criminal Court, Nairobi for the government of Kenya, the White House and Capitol Hill for the executive and legislative branches, respectively, of the United States federal government, or Foggy Bottom for the US State Department. A place can represent an entire industry: for instance Wall Street is often used metonymically to describe the entire U.S. financial and corporate banking sector. Common nouns and phrases can also be metonyms: red tape can stand for bureaucracy, whether or not that bureaucracy actually uses red tape to bind documents. In Commonwealth realms, The Crown is a metonym for the state in all its aspects.\n\nWestern culture studied poetic language and deemed it to be rhetoric. A. Al-Sharafi supports this concept in his book \"Textual Metonymy\", \"Greek rhetorical scholarship at one time became entirely poetic scholarship.\" Philosophers and rhetoricians thought that metaphors were the primary figurative language used in rhetoric. Metaphors served as a better means to attract the audience’s attention because the audience had to read between the lines in order to get an understanding of what the speaker was trying to say. Others did not think of metonymy as a good rhetorical method because metonymy did not involve symbolism. Al-Sharafi explains, \"This is why they undermined practical and purely referential discourse because it was seen as banal and not containing anything new, strange or shocking.\"\n\nGreek scholars contributed to the definition of metonymy. For example, Isocrates worked to define the difference between poetic language and non-poetic language by saying that, \"Prose writers are handicapped in this regard because their discourse has to conform to the forms and terms used by the citizens and to those arguments which are precise and relevant to the subject-matter.\" In other words, Isocrates proposes here that metaphor is a distinctive feature of poetic language because it conveys the experience of the world afresh and provides a kind of defamiliarisation in the way the citizens perceive the world. Democritus described metonymy by saying, \"Metonymy, that is the fact that words and meaning change.\" Aristotle discussed different definitions of metaphor, regarding one type as what we know to be metonymy today.\n\nLatin scholars also had an influence on metonymy. The treatise \"Rhetorica ad Herennium\" states metonymy as, \"the figure which draws from an object closely akin or associated an expression suggesting the object meant, but not called by its own name.\" The author describes the process of metonymy to us saying that we first figure out what a word means. We then figure out that word’s relationship with other words. We understand and then call the word by a name that it is associated with. \"Perceived as such then metonymy will be a figure of speech in which there is a process of abstracting a relation of proximity between two words to the extent that one will be used in place of another.\" Cicero viewed metonymy as more of a stylish rhetorical method and described it as being based on words, but motivated by style.\n\nMetonymy became important in French structuralism through the work of Roman Jakobson. In his 1956 essay \"The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles\", Jakobson relates metonymy to the linguistic practice of [syntagmatic] combination and to the literary practice of realism. He explains:\nThe primacy of the metaphoric process in the literary schools of Romanticism and symbolism has been repeatedly acknowledged, but it is still insufficiently realized that it is the predominance of metonymy which underlies and actually predetermines the so-called 'realistic' trend, which belongs to an intermediary stage between the decline of Romanticism and the rise of symbolism and is opposed to both. Following the path of contiguous relationships, the realistic author metonymically digresses from the plot to the atmosphere and from the characters to the setting in space and time. He is fond of synecdochic details. In the scene of Anna Karenina's suicide Tolstoy's artistic attention is focused on the heroine's handbag; and in \"War and Peace\" the synecdoches \"hair on the upper lip\" or \"bare shoulders\" are used by the same writer to stand for the female characters to whom these features belong.\n\nJakobson's theories were important for Claude Lévi-Strauss, Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, and others.\n\nDreams can use metonyms.\n\nMetonyms can also be wordless. For example, Roman Jakobson argued that cubist art relied heavily on nonlinguistic metonyms, while surrealist art relied more on metaphors.\n\nLakoff and Turner argued that all words are metonyms: “Words stand for the concepts they express.” Some artists have used actual words as metonyms in their paintings. For example, Miró’s 1925 painting \"Photo: This is the Color of My Dreams\" has the word “photo” to represent the image of his dreams. This painting comes from a series of paintings called peintures-poésies (paintings-poems) which reflect Miró’s interest in dreams and the subconscious and the relationship of words, images, and thoughts. Picasso, in his 1911 painting \"Pipe Rack and Still Life on Table\" inserts the word “Ocean” rather than painting an ocean: These paintings by Miró and Picasso are, in a sense, the reverse of a rebus: the word stands for the picture, instead of the picture standing for the word.\n\n\n"}

A common English example would be \"la la la\", \"na na na\" or \"da da da\".\n\nNon-lexical vocables are used in yodeling, Blackfoot music and other Native American music, Pygmy music, the music of the Maldives, Irish music, and Highland Scots music. Vocables frequently act as formal markers, indicating the beginning and end of phrases, sections or songs themselves, and also as onomatopoeic references, cueing devices, and other purposes.\n\nThe Blackfoot, like other Plains Indians, use the consonants \"h\", \"y\", \"w\", and vowels. They avoid \"n\", \"c\" (\"ts\") and other consonants. \"i\" and \"e\" tend slightly to be higher pitches, \"a\", \"o\", and \"u\" lower ones.\n\nThe AIM Song has its origins in the Plains; as such, it holds similar characteristics to Blackfoot song. It is intended as an intertribal song, so the use of non-lexical vocables prevents bias to one particular language.\n\nOther traditional musical forms employing non-lexical vocables include:\n\nScat singing is a type of voice instrumental music. A scat is vocalized using wordless vocables and syllables (e.g. \"bippity-bippity-doo-wop-razzamatazz-skoobie-doobie-shoobity-bee-bop-a-lula-shabazz\") as employed by jazz singers. Scat singing gives singers the ability to sing improvised melodies and rhythms, to create the equivalent of an instrumental solo using their voice. Scatman John (John Paul Larkin) renewed interest in the genre briefly during the mid-90s.\n\nVocal improviser Bobby McFerrin’s performances at major concert halls worldwide show that “wordless singing has traveled far from the concepts demonstrated by Louis Armstrong, Gladys Bentley, Cab Calloway, Anita O’Day, and Leo Watson”.\n\nAnother method of scat singing is practiced by guitarists who scat along with their solos note for note. Notable practitioners include George Benson, Sheldon Reynolds, and Rik Emmett.\n\nNon-lexical vocables that take on percussive roles:\n\n\nThe song \"Swinging the Alphabet\" is sung by The Three Stooges in their short film \"Violent Is the Word for Curly\" (1938). It is the only full-length song performed by the Stooges in their short films, and the only time they mimed to their own pre-recorded soundtrack. The lyrics use each letter of the alphabet to make a nonsense verse of the song:\n\nThe song \"Mairzy Doats\" (1943) used blurred lyrics that sound non-lexical:\nHowever, the lyrics of the bridge provide a clue:\n\nExamples of popular music employing non-lexical vocables include:\n\nJack Black uses non-lexical vocables whilst singing as Tenacious D\n\nVan Morrison employed scat in his performances.\n\nScat singing influenced the development of doo-wop and hip hop. It was popular enough in doo-wop that Barry Mann and Gerry Goffin made it the subject of a 1961 song, Who Put the Bomp (in the Bomp, Bomp, Bomp)\". It has also appeared in various genres of rock music. Jim Morrison of The Doors sings a chorus of slow scat on the song \"Cars Hiss By My Window\", trying to replicate a harmonica solo he had heard, as well as on the song \"Roadhouse Blues\"; scat singing also notably opens the B-side of Joe Walsh's 1973 album \"The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get\" with the song \"Meadow\". The technique was employed in the song \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" by Pink Floyd, as well as the R&B song \"Rubber Biscuit\" by The Chips (also as by The Blues Brothers). The list of scat singers includes such greats as Jelly Roll Morton, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, Cab Calloway, Scatman Crothers, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan, Sammy Davis Jr., Mel Tormé, Tony Bennett, Cleo Laine, Roger Miller, Aretha Franklin, Van Morrison, and the Pointer Sisters.\n\nScatting also makes appearances in newer genres, including industrial music, in the chorus of Ministry's 1991 song \"\"; nu metal music, in the band Korn (whose lead singer Jonathan Davis has incorporated scat singing into songs such as \"Twist\", \"Ball Tongue\", \"Freak on a Leash\", \"B.B.K.\", \"Beat it Upright\", \"Liar\", and \"Rotting in Vain\"); and the heavy metal subgenre of death metal, where scat singing is used by John Tardy of the band Obituary. Jack Black incorporates scat into several Tenacious D songs, most notably: \"Tribute\", \"Cosmic Shame\", \"Classico,\" \"Jesus Ranch,\" Low Hangin' Fruit,\" and \"Bowie\". Singer JoJo performs ad-libbed scats on the track \"Yes or No\". Other modern examples include \"Under Pressure\" by Queen (band), \"Rag Doll\" by Aerosmith, \"Under My Voodoo\" by Sublime, \"No! Don't Shoot\" by Foxy Shazam, \"Ma Meeshka Mow Skwoz\" by Mr. Bungle, \"In My Bed\" by Amy Winehouse, and \"Stuck in the Middle\" by Mika. Scatman John combined scat and early-1990s electronic dance music.\n\nExamples by popular non-anglophone singers using such techniques include \"Bla Bla Bla\" by Gigi D'Agostino, \"Eena Mina Dika\" in the Bollywood film \"Aasha\", Eduard Khil's \"I Am Glad, Cause I'm Finally Returning Back Home\" (known as \"Trololo\") sung entirely without lyrics, \"Fuzao\" by Faye Wong, \"Lagu Lagu\" by Sa Dingding and \"Din Daa Daa\" by George Kranz.\n\nDue to the wide-ranging vocal styles used in popular music, occasionally songs have been mistakenly categorized as having non-lexical vocables, when in fact the singers are performing actual lyrics rendered partially (or completely) unintelligible to the ear of some (but not all) listeners. Two famous 1960s examples are \"Louie Louie\" as recorded by The Kingsmen and \"Wooly Bully\" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs.\n\nA signature of some Disney musical films is their songs' use of nonsense words, the longest and most famous of which is from \"Mary Poppins\", entitled \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\". A close second is \"Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah\" from \"Song of the South\", which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song.

However, the French were defeated by the British in the Battle of the Nile and in the subsequent Treaty of Alexandria, all Egyptian antiquities collected by the French became the property of the British Crown. The obelisks, along with other objects, were then taken to England and presented to King George III, who in turn donated them to the British Museum in 1802.\n\nThe pair of obelisks were originally set up at a temple complex in Hermopolis, Middle Egypt, under the Thirtieth Dynasty reign of the Pharaoh Nectanebo II. This dynasty witnessed a renaissance in art and culture that had begun under its first King Nectanebo I. The two obelisks were probably erected on either side of a ramp leading to the entrance of a temple. They are fragmentary, with only half of them extant.

{"id": "8976076", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8976076", "title": "Okanagan language", "text": "Okanagan language\n\nOkanagan, or Colville-Okanagan, is a Salish language which arose among the indigenous peoples of the southern Interior Plateau region based primarily in the Okanagan River Basin and the Columbia River Basin in precolonial times in Canada and the United States. Following British, American, and Canadian colonization during the 1800s and the subsequent repression of all Salishan languages, the use of Colville-Okanagan declined drastically.\n\nColville-Okanagan is highly endangered and is rarely learned as either a first or second language. About 150 deeply fluent speakers of Colville-Okanagan Salish remain, the majority of whom live in British Columbia. The language is currently moribund and has no first-language speakers younger than 50 years of age. Colville-Okanagan is the second-most spoken Salish language after Shuswap.\n\nHistorically, Colville-Okanagan originated from a language which was spoken in the Columbia River Basin and is now termed Proto Southern Interior Salish. As a result of the initial expansion of Colville-Okanagan prior to European contact, the language developed three separate dialects: Colville, Okanagan, and Lakes. A low degree of dialectic divergence exists in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Variation is primarily confined to pronunciation.\n\nThe vast majority of Colville-Okanagan words are from Proto-Salish or Proto-Interior Salish. A number of Colville-Okanagan words are shared with or borrowed from the neighboring Salish, Sahaptian, and Kutenai languages. More recent word borrowings are from English and French. Colville-Okanagan was an exclusively oral form of communication until the late 19th century, when priests and linguists began transcribing the language for word lists, dictionaries, grammars, and translations. Colville-Okanagan is currently written in Latin script using the American Phonetic Alphabet.\n\nIn Colville-Okanagan the language itself is known as \"n̓səl̓xcin̓\" or \"nsyilxcn\". Speakers of \"n̓səl̓xcin̓\" occupied the northern portion of the Columbia Basin from the Methow River in the west, to Kootenay Lake in the east, and north along the Columbia River and the Arrow Lakes. In Colville-Okanagan, all \"nsyilxcn\"-speaking bands are grouped under the ethnic label \"syilx\". Colville-Okanagan is the heritage language of the Lower Similkameen Indian Band, the Upper Similkameen Indian Band, the Westbank First Nation, the Osoyoos Indian Band, the Penticton Indian Band, the Okanagan Indian Band, the Upper Nicola Indian Band, and the Colville, Sanpoil, Okanogan, Lakes, Nespelem, and Methow bands of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation.\n\nIn 2012, the CBC featured a report on a family which is teaching its children \"n̓səl̓xcin̓\" in the home.\n\nFive nonprofit organizations which support Colville-Okanagan language acquisition and revitalization are the Paul Creek Language Association in Keremeos, British Columbia, the En'owkin Centre in Penticton, British Columbia, the Hearts Gathered Waterfall Montessori in Omak, Washington, the Salish School of Spokane in Spokane, Washington, and the Inchelium Language and Culture Association in Inchelium.\n\nRevitalization efforts for Colville-Okanagan in the United States are limited largely to instruction for children . However, concentrated efforts are made on the part of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation to promote language preservation. Among the activities in which the Confederation takes part are allocating funds both local and federal for cultural preservation projects. The Confederated Tribes' goals are to establish three language programs, develop language dictionaries, provide translation services and curriculum, and establish language classes with a regular attendance of 30 or more people. Though the Confederation's efforts are laudable, the limitations of 150 truly native speakers are evident. Language revitalization on the scale the Confederation proposes is limited by the number of native speakers available for those projects.\n\nDespite the confederation's efforts, language revitalization cannot be reproduced on such a large scale in the short run. The Salish School of Spokane in Washington takes a smaller approach towards revitalization. This school caters to the Colville-Okanagan-speaking population in the tribal regions of northeastern Washington. This school's efforts fall under the category of full-immersion school. The Salish School's target demographic is children between the ages of one and 10 years old. This places the Salish School of Spokane in the children revitalization group of schools. The school's programs are designed to spur full native fluency in Okanagan before the age of 10. The school does this by offering classes in Okangan from 9 am to 3:15 pm. According to school expectations and curricula, children are expected to speak Okanagan for the duration of their time in school. In addition, the school is committed to an active learning strategy, that is, children are taught common nursery rhythms (heads, shoulders, knees, and toes) that engage the learner's body.\n\nThe Salish School of Spokane makes a point of not falling into the trap of monopolizing teaching resources. Unlike Walsh's examples of tribes opting to not share materials, the Salish School maintains a variety of audio resources and curricula to advance Okanagan revitalization. Along with these efforts, the school not only provides curriculum, but also helps develop and translate it. The Salish School works alongside organizations such as the Paul Creek Language Association, a nonprofit based in British Columbia, on the N̓səl̓xcin̓ Curriculum Project. The N̓səl̓xcin̓ Project aims to create foundational lesson plans from which teachers of Okanagan can draw. The project is spearheaded by Christopher Parkin, and is translated primarily by the fluent elder Sarah Peterson, with the additional help of Hazel Abrahamson and Herman Edwards. The participation of native speakers ensures clear meaning and high fidelity to the Okanagan language. The project is composed of six textbooks divided into three levels. Each level consists of a language book which contains a number of audio recordings, language, and learning software to ease language teaching. Additionally, each level includes a literature book. The literature book provides the vital function of providing entertainment for language learners when outside of class and also reinforces sentence construction for Okanagan. Most importantly, the curriculum developed by the N̓səl̓xcin̓ Curriculum Project is available in electronic format online free of charge.\n\nTo encourage interest in teaching vocations, the En'Owkin places a strong emphasis on its various certification programs. The Certificate of Aboriginal Language Revitalization is offered in the En'Owkin Centre and is taught by linguist Maxine Baptiste. The course does have a fee involved, but the certificate is offered in partnership with the University of Victoria. Additionally, the center also offers a certification to become a Certified Early Childhood Education Assistant which is in partnership with Nicola Valley Institute of Technology. The certificate does not qualify one to teach at the secondary level, but does ensure employability in daycare and pre-K. The strategy behind these two certificates ensures that potential teachers have easy access to college credits from centers of higher learning like the University of Victoria, and potential education assistants can be involved in the education of children, thus establishing fluency in Okanagan early on. \nFinally, the En'Owkin Centre places a heavy emphasis on its college readiness programs. The importance of these programs lies not only in setting up native students for success, but also incorporating Colville-Okanagan courses into curriculum for young adult to adult students. William Cohen notes in his article, that many native students perform poorly in school and the high school dropout rate for aboriginal high schoolers is very high.\n\nConsonant inventory of Okanagan:\n\nOkanagan is also reported to contain the rare uvular flap.\n\nThe vowels found in Lakes are: [i], [a], [u], [ə], and [o]. The [ə] is the single unstressed variant of the full vowels in Okanagan while the [o] vowel is found only in borrowed words. Stress will fall only on the full vowels [i], [a], and [u] in Okanagan.\n\nThe morphology of Okanagan is fairly complex. It is a head-marking language that relies mostly on grammatical information being placed directly on the predicate by means of affixes and clitics. The combination of derivational and inflectional suffixes and prefixes that are added onto the stem words make for a compact language.\n\nOkanagan demonstrates great flexibility when dealing with persons, number, and gender. The language encodes the person via a series of prefixes and suffixes, and uses its number system in tandem with pluralized pronominals to communicate the number of actors within a sentence. For example:\n\n\"tkaˀkaˀɬis\"\n\nk- kaˀ- kaˀɬis\n\nnum.classifier plural.redup three\n\n\"There are three people\" \n\nIn this example the /k/ classification designates that the word contains a numeral classifier.\n\nAdditionally, Okanagan relies heavily on the use of suffixes to designate gender. Okanagan handles gender in much the same way, by attaching both determiner and ‘man' to the sentence, the gender of an object or subject can be communicated:\n\n\"wikən iˀ sqəltmix\"\n\nwik- -ən iˀ sqəltmix\n\nsaw 1sg det man\n\"I saw the man\"\n\nIn this example, there is a combination of 2nd singular marker with ‘wife.' ‘She' is encoded into the meaning of the word via the inclusion of the gender suffix at the end of the sentence.\n\nPerson markers within Okanagan are attached to verbs, nouns, or adjectives. The marker used depending on transitivity of verbs and other conditions outlined below. The person maker used largely depends on the case being used in the sentence.\n\nAbsolutive markers within Okanagan can only be used if the predicate of the sentence is intransitive.\nFor example, [Kən c'k-am] (I count) is perfectly viable in Okanagan, but *[Kən c'k-ən-t] *(I count it)is not because the verb 'count' is transitive. Person markers never occur without an accompanying intransitive verb.\n\nSimple possessives within Okanagan are predominantly a result of prefixation and circumfixation on a verb. However, Okanagan uses simple possessives as aspect forms on the verb in very complex ways. This practice is predominantly seen in Southern interior Salish languages.\n\nThe stem: \"kilx\" 'hand'\n\nWhere prefixation occurs with -in / an in the 1st and 2nd person singular, /n/ may undergo deletion as below:\n\nisxʷuytn\nin-s-xʷuy-tan\n1sgposs-nom -go- inst\n\"They are my tracks.\"\n\nakɬtkɬmilxʷ\nan- kɬ- tkɬmilxʷ\n2sgposs-to be-woman\n\"She is your wife to be.\"\n\nanik'mən\nan-nik'mən\n2sgposs-knife\n\"your knife\"\n\nIn the case of verbs, Okanagan morphology handles transitivity in various ways. The first is a set of rules for verbs that only have a single direct object, transitive verbs. For the ergative case there are two variants of person markers a stressed and an unstressed.\n\nStressed and Unstressed\nThe stem: c'k-ən-t is the equivalent of the transitive verb 'count.'\n\nwikn̓t (see it) is an example of a strong -nt- transitive past/present verb, with 'XX' identifying non-occurring combinations and '--' identifying semantic combinations which require the reflexive suffix -cut-\n\nThere are two sets of verb affixes each containing two members that dictate the composition of a verb. The first set is composed of the affixes –nt-, and -ɬt-. The second set is composed of –st- and x(i)t- where ‘i' is a stressed vowel.\n\nThe major difference between two sets is how they incorporate affixes to remain grammatically correct. In the case of the –nt-, -ɬt- group, all particles and suffixes joining onto the stem and suffix of the verb will be identical for both. The –nt- affix connects to the stem of a transitive verb via suffixation. The suffix –nt- can only make reference to two persons: an actor and a primary goal.\n\nq̓y̓əntin q'y'-ənt-in (I write something)\n\nThe -ɬt- affix is the ditransitive counterpart of –nt- and works in much the same. The difference between the two is that it refers to three persons: an actor, and two other actors or goals. Furthermore, -ɬt- is further differentiated from its ditransitive cousin -x(i)t- because it does not require a clitic to be a part of the verb.\nIn contrast to this group, -st- and –x(i)t- operate by unique rules. The –st- affix, much like its counterpart must be added to a verb stem by means of suffixation, it is also transitive, and refers to an actor and a primary goal, but it implies a reference to a third person, or a secondary goal without explicitly stating it.\n\nq̓y̓əstin q'y'-əst-in. (I write it [for myself])\nThe -x(i)t- ditransitive affix shares all of the features of -ɬt- with the sole exception that it requires a clitic to be attached to front of the verb stem. The reason for the clitic in Okanagan is to add emphasis or focus on the second object, whereas -ɬt- makes no distinction.\n\nEach clause in Okanagan can be divided into two parts: inflected predicates which are required for every sentence, and optional arguments. Okanagan allows a maximum of two arguments per sentence construction. These are marked by pronominal markers on the predicate. Each argument is introduced to the sentence via an initial determiner; the only exception to initial determiners is in the case of proper names which do not need determiners to introduce them. Predicates may be of any lexical category. There may be additional arguments added to a sentence in Okanagan via complementizers. Okanagan is unique among the majority of Salish languages for the inclusion of the complementizer.\n\n Okanagan has one oblique marker that serves adapts it to several different functions depending upon the context in which it is used. The oblique marker ‘t' can be used to mark the object of an intransitive verb, as in the case below.\n\nkən ˀiɬən t sɬiq\nI eat obl meat\nI ate (some)meat \n\n‘t' may also mark the agent in a passive construction, and it may be used to mark the ergative agent of transitive verbs. Finally, the oblique ‘t' may be used to mark functions including time and instrument:\n\nkən txam t sx̌əx̌c'iˀ\nI comb obl stick\n\"I combed my hair with a stick\" \n\n‘t' may also coincide with the determiner ‘iʔ' in the case of instrumentals and passive agents:\n\ntʕapəntís [iʔ [t swlwlmínk] ].\nshoot-DIR-3SG.ERG DET OBL gun\nHe shot it with a gun.\nMike cúmqs-nt-m [iʔ [t tkɬmílxʷ] ].\nMike kiss-DIR-PASS DET OBL woman\nMike was kissed by the woman.\n\nThere are a number of complements available to Okanagan to clarify its predicates among these are positional complements, which merely indicate the place of a predicate. \nIn addition to positional complements, there are a variety of marked complements, complements used in Okanagan that express further meaning through a series of particles.\n\nThe first of the marked complements is the prefix /yi/. For the most part, /yi/ is an optional complement that is used in definite cases with the exception of cases when a proper noun is used. In such cases, the /yi/ prefix is not allowed. When /yi/ is used it refers to a definite referent.\n\nwikən yiʔ sqilxʷ\n\" I saw the/those people.\"\nThe sequential complements are composed of the particles /ɬ/ and /ɬa/. /ɬa/ conveys temporal sequence while /ɬ/ represents a subordinate element.\n\nway̓ x̌ast ɬ kʷ cxʷuy̓\n\"It's good if/that you come.\"\n\nway̓ x̌ast ɬa kʷ cxʷuy̓\n\"It will be good when/after you come.\"\n\nOkanagan also contains a number of locational complements which refer to when or where something happened. It is a point of reference. The /l/ and the variant /lə/particles are used to tie a predicate to a time or place.\nxʷuy̓ lə sənkʷəkʷəʔac.\n\"He went in the night\"\n\nAblative complements in Okanagan come in the form of the /tl/ particle. Along with directional complements, /k̓/ and /k̓l/, Okanagan speakers can indicate motion. The ablative complement /tl/ only serves to indicate ‘moving away from.' For instance, in the sentence below, the ablative is ‘from (across the ocean).'\n\nKʷ scutxx tl sk̓ʷətikənx\n\"Were you saying [that he is] from Seattle?\"\n\nThe directional complement's two particles represent both direction towards something, and direction towards a specific location. /k/ signifies movement towards something:\n\nk̓ incitxʷ\n\"to my house\" (not towards it)\n\nThe /k̓l/ particle modifies this sentence so that it specifies the house as the location to which the subject must move.\nk̓əl incitxʷ\n\"To my house\" (there specifically)\n\nVerbs may react in a number of different ways when a suffix is attached to the root stem of the word. Below are a number of ways in which intransitive roots are modified.\n\n-t can indicate a natural characteristic of the root\nc̓ik̓ \"burn\"\nc̓ik̓t \"burned\"\n\n-lx indicates the subject is engaged in an activity\nqiclx \"run\"\n\n-ils expresses state of mind.\nnk̓wpils \"lonely\"\n\n-p expresses lack of a subject's control\nkmap \"darkening\"\n\nTransitives:\n\n-n involves action upon an object by a subject\nkʷuʔ caʔntis \"he hit me\"\n\n-s involve action or state resulting from an activity.\nkʷu cˀaistixʷ\n\n-cut indicates when the action of a subject is directed toward oneself.\ntarqncut \"kick oneself\"\n\nTransitive stems without person markings indicate imperatives\nnlk̓ipnt \"open it\"\n\nIntransitives can express an imperative via the –x suffix:\nxʷuyx \"go\"\n\nThe Okanagan system relies heavily on its affixes to demonstrate tense, space, and time. Below are demonstrated various affixes that attach to roots to encode meaning. \nOf the following two examples, they are only possible in the –n transitive paradigm.\n\nks- unrealized action\n\nikstxt̓ám\n\"I'm going to look after him\"\n\nsəc- past perfect\nˁi-səc-txt'-am\n\"I've been looking after him.\"\n\nThe following examples are for intransitives.\n\n-k Unrealized: expresses an intentional future action or state. (I am going to…)\nKn kʷal̓t\n\" I'm warm\"\n\n-aʔx Continuative: Action or state that is in progress\n\nɬ- Movement back\n\nc- Movement toward speaker\n\nkɬ- down, and under \n\ntl̓ from, source.\n\nk̓l to, at, goal, recipient, dative.\n\nk̓ for, benefative.\n\nl on, locative.\n\nnˁəɬ with, comitative.\n\nˁit with, by, instrumental \n\n\n"}

It consists of a 3 features, a hill and mound connected by a zig-zag causeway formed by 2 almost parallel ditches to another rectangular enclosure measuring surrounded by a large ditch with a suggested bank up to wide. It is located in the northwest of Hatfield Forest in Beggarshall coppice. It has been considered to be an ancient defensive enclosure, but is too small to be a hill fort and is not in a defensible position.\n\nArchaeological excavations were carried out in 1964–1965 with recovered evidence including a small flint blade 4 cm long, animal bones, flints, and charcoal with very slight dating evidence suggesting Iron Age construction. The archaeologists suggested that the initial, ‘V’ shaped, ditch surrounding the mound would have been approximately 2 metres in depth suggesting it once had earth ramparts supported by timber. Smaller banks have been noted to cross Shermore Brook to Spittlemore coppice.\n\nIn 1975 retired geologist and researcher Christian O'Brien suggested that Portingbury Hills had a purpose in archaeoastronomy and was constructed in the Bronze Age which gave it some brief coverage in the Sunday Telegraph. O'Brien suggested that the mound was aligned astronomically with Wandlebury Hill via a series of equally spaced, hand-carved, stone monoliths forming a Loxodrome. Eleven of the original twenty-six markers are still in situ, such as the Leper Stone, with several of the other distinctive stones lying nearby. O'Brien's theory met with mixed reviews from astronomers and archaeologists. Glyn Daniel, Professor of Archaeology at Cambridge University dismissed the paper as \"nonsense\" and Alexander Thom could find nothing in it to revise the documented view of Wandlebury as an Iron Age Fort. Archie Roy, Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow University commented that \"in the absence of a more convincing explanation, this conclusion also has to be taken very seriously.” \n\n\n"}
{"id": "1931801", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1931801", "title": "Principle of charity", "text": "Principle of charity\n\nIn philosophy and rhetoric, the principle of charity or charitable interpretation requires interpreting a speaker's statements in the most rational way possible and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation. In its narrowest sense, the goal of this methodological principle is to avoid attributing irrationality, logical fallacies, or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available. According to Simon Blackburn \"it constrains the interpreter to maximize the truth or rationality in the subject's sayings.\"\n\nNeil L. Wilson gave the principle its name in 1958–59. Its main area of application, by his lights, is determining the referent of a proper name:\nHow should we set about discovering the significance which a person attaches to a given name? […] Let us suppose that somebody (whom I am calling \"Charles\") makes just the following five assertions containing the name \"Caesar.\" […]\n(1) Caesar conquered Gaul. (Gc) \n(2) Caesar crossed the Rubicon. (Rc) \n(3) Caesar was murdered on the Ides of March. (Mc) \n[…] And so we act on what might be called the Principle of Charity. We select as designatum that individual which will make the largest possible number of Charles' statements true. […] We might say the designatum is that individual which satisfies more of the asserted matrices containing the word \"Caesar\" than does any other individual. \nWillard Van Orman Quine and Donald Davidson provide other formulations of the principle of charity. Davidson sometimes referred to it as \"the principle of rational accommodation\". He summarized it: \"We make maximum sense of the words and thoughts of others when we interpret in a way that optimises agreement\". The principle may be invoked to make sense of a speaker's utterances when one is unsure of their meaning. In particular, Quine's use of the principle gives it this latter, wide domain.\n\nSince the time of Quine \"et al.\", other philosophers have formulated at least four versions of the principle of charity. These alternatives may conflict with one another, so which principle to use may depend on the goal of the conversation. The four principles are:\n\n\nA related principle is the principle of humanity, which states that we must assume that another speaker's beliefs and desires are connected to each other and to reality in some way, and attribute to him or her \"the propositional attitudes one supposes one would have oneself in those circumstances\" (Daniel Dennett, \"Mid-Term Examination,\" in \"The Intentional Stance\", p. 343).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30876385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30876385", "title": "Royal prerogative", "text": "Royal prerogative\n\nThe royal prerogative is a body of customary authority, privilege, and immunity, recognized in common law and, sometimes, in civil law jurisdictions possessing a monarchy, as belonging to the sovereign and which have become widely vested in the government. It is the means by which some of the executive powers of government, possessed by and vested in a monarch with regard to the process of governance of the state, are carried out.\n\nIn most constitutional monarchies, prerogatives can be abolished by Parliament as the courts apply the constitutional near-absolute of the supremacy of Parliament. In the Commonwealth realms this draws on the constitutional statutes at the time of the Glorious Revolution when William III and Mary II were invited to take the throne.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the remaining powers of the royal prerogative are devolved to the head of the government which for more than two centuries has been the Prime Minister; the benefits, equally, such as mineral rights in all gold and silver ores, vest in (belong to) the government.\n\nIn Britain, prerogative powers were originally exercised by the monarch acting, without an observed requirement for parliamentary consent (after its empowerment in certain matters following Magna Carta). Since the accession of the House of Hanover these powers have been, with minor exceptions in economically unimportant sectors, exercised on the advice of the Prime Minister or the Cabinet, who are accountable to Parliament, exclusively so, except in matters of the Royal Family, since at least the time of William IV.\n\nTypically in liberal democracies that are constitutional monarchies as well as nation states, such as those of Denmark, Norway, or Sweden, the royal prerogative serves in practice as a prescribed ceremonial function of the \"state power\".\n\nToday, prerogative powers fall into two main categories:\n\n\n\nSome key areas of government are carried out by the royal prerogative but its usage is falling as functions are progressively made statutory.\n\nIn Australia, the royal prerogative is vested in the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, and this is included in the Constitution.\n\nIn Canada, the royal prerogative is, for the most part, the same as that in the United Kingdom, as constrained by constitutional convention, although its exercise is usually through the federal governor general or the lieutenant governors of the provinces in their respective privy councils. The royal prerogative in Canada is largely set out in Part III of the Constitution Act, 1867, particularly section 9.\n\nAs foreign affairs are a matter of royal prerogative, the power to declare war and deploy the armed forces belongs to the Crown, though only in its federal Cabinet (the federal government), as outlined in sections 9 and 15 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Neither legislation nor any other type of parliamentary approval, beyond budgetary matters, is required for such actions, though the Cabinet has on occasion consulted parliament before engaging Canada or extending Canada's involvement in a conflict. Additionally, the federal and provincial crowns may ratify treaties, though only so far as they fall within the proper area of jurisdiction, according to sections 91 and 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Again, the endorsement of parliament is not necessary for these agreements to have force in an international sense, but the legislatures must pass treaties in order for them to have domestic effect. Proposed treaties have also occasionally been presented to parliament for debate before ratification. Members of Parliament have tabled bills seeking to curtail the use of the royal prerogative in foreign affairs by legislating a greater role for parliament, as have Senate standing committees, from time to time, called for the same.\n\nThe issuance of passports also remains within the royal prerogative in Canada. The terms for the issuing of passports by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Crown are set out in the Canadian Passport Order, issued by the Governor General-in-Council. The Canadian government has used the royal prerogative on two occasions to deny a passport to a Canadian citizen, Abdurahman Khadr and Fateh Kamel. Lawsuits filed at the Federal Court, Federal Court of Appeal, and ultimately the Supreme Court of Canada did not find in favour of either Khadr, nor Kamel.\n\nThe royal prerogative in Canada extends also to the granting of honours, as explained by the Court of Appeal for Ontario in Black v. Chrétien (regarding Conrad Black's entitlement to an appointment to the House of Lords while a Canadian citizen). Other royal prerogatives, such as the prerogative of mercy, also exist in the Canadian context.\n\nIn the Kingdom of England (up to 1707), the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1800), and the United Kingdom (since 1801), the royal prerogative was one of the central features of the realm's governance.\n\nConstitutional theorist A. V. Dicey gives the standard definition of what prerogative powers as follows:\n\nThe scope of the royal prerogative is difficult to determine due to the uncodified nature of the constitution. It is clear that the existence and extent of the power is a matter of the common law of England, making the courts the final arbiter of whether a particular type of prerogative exists or not. Nevertheless, certain prerogative powers have been widely acknowledged and accepted over time, while others have fallen out of use.\n\nThe royal prerogative is not constitutionally unlimited. In the Case of Proclamations (1611) during the reign of King James VI/I, English common law courts judges emphatically asserted that they possessed the right to determine the limits of the royal prerogative. Since the Glorious Revolution in 1688, which brought co-monarchs Queen Mary II and King William III to power, this interpretation of there being a separate and distinct power of the Judiciary has not been challenged by the Crown. It has been accepted that it is emphatically the province of the court(s) to say what the law is, or means. This is a crucial corollary and foundation to the concept of the judicial power; and its distinct and separate nature from the executive power possessed by the Crown itself, or its ministers.\n\nGenerally, the Crown retains all the power of the state in a Crown colony (even if in practice it is not directly exercised), which was later renamed ‘dependent territory’ in 1983 and has been known as ‘overseas territory’ since 2002. Thus the royal prerogative is in theory an unlimited, arbitrary authority. In British overseas territories however, each inhabited territory has a constitution by which the territory is governed locally.\n\nThe absoluteness of the royal prerogative in the colonies was however defeated in the case of \"Campbell v. Hall\" in 1774. This case decided that once a colony gained a representative assembly (or once the governor has been instructed to call one), the royal authority is limited to the familiar prerogatives; without the assembly's consent the Crown could not raise taxation nor change the law. Several of the colonies of the British West Indies thus became \"settled colonies\", and reverted to \"crown colony\" status only by Act of Parliament in the nineteenth century.\n\nIn August 2009 the government of the Turks and Caicos Islands, a UK dependency, was revested in the governor, on the advice of the Government of the United Kingdom, under an Order in Council of 18 March 2009, which suspended and amended parts of the Islands' constitution, and vacated all the offices of ministers and the House of Assembly. This was not itself an exercise of the royal prerogative, as it was made under \"the West Indies Act 1962 and of all other powers enabling Her to do so\". However, in effect the order extended the royal prerogative in the Islands, vesting wide discretionary legislative and executive powers in Her Majesty's governor. The governor remains subject to the amended constitution, and in practice to the instructions of the Queen's Foreign Office in the UK.\n\nIn the case of the Chagos Archipelago, in 2000, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales ruled that a local ordinance made by the Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory exiling the islanders was unlawful, a decision which was accepted by the British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook. That Order was legislation passed under authority given by the royal prerogative, not an exercise of the prerogative itself, and was overturned as being beyond the powers given. After this decision, the British government issued an Order in Council, a primary exercise of the royal prerogative, to achieve the same objective. This Order was also ruled unlawful by the High Court, a ruling upheld in the Court of Appeal. However, on Wednesday, 22 October 2008, the government won its appeal in the House of Lords against the previous rulings. The House decided by a three-to-two majority that the Order in Council was a lawful exercise of authority. In their speeches, the Law Lords admitted the government of the day was morally wrong to force out some 2,000 residents of the Chagos Archipelago, a British Crown colony, to make way for a US air base in the 1960s. Nevertheless, the majority could not find legal fault in the Order.\n\nIn the other Commonwealth realms, the royal prerogative can be or is specifically mandated to be exercised by the monarch's representative, the governor-general. The constitution of a Commonwealth realm may sharply limit the prerogative and many governmental acts which would be done under the prerogative in other countries are given effect by the constitution or Acts of Parliament in the Commonwealth realm.\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978, Title II \"The Crown\", Article 62, delineates the powers of the king, while Title IV \"Government and Administration\", Article 99, defines the king's role in government. Title VI \"Judicial Power\", Article 117, Articles 122 through 124, outlines the king's role in the country's independent judiciary. However, by constitutional convention established by Juan Carlos I, the king exercises his prerogatives having solicited government advice while maintaining a politically non-partisan and independent monarchy. Receiving government advice does not necessarily bind the monarch into executing the advice, except where prescribed by the constitution.\n\n\n\n"}

Some of these beliefs are popular superstitions, while others are actually better described as traditions, stories, folklore, tropes, myths, or legend.\n\nThe origins of many of these superstitions are based in the inherent risks of sailing, and luck, either good or bad, as well as portents and omens that would be given associative meaning in relation to the life of a mariner, sailor, fisherman or a crew in general. Even into the 21st century, \"fishers and related fishing workers\" still have amongst the most dangerous jobs, with the second highest rate of mortality only after loggers.\n\nBy far the best known sailors' superstitions involve bad luck.\n\nSailors are taught if the sunrise is red to take warning. The day ahead will be dangerous.\n\n\"Red Sky at night, Sailors delight; Red Sky in the morning, Sailors take warning.\"\n\nA \"Jonah\" is a long-established expression among sailors, meaning a person (either a sailor or a passenger) who is bad luck, which is based on the Biblical prophet Jonah. The comic character Jonah's name is a direct reference to the long established sailor's superstition.\nThis concept is prominent in the film \"\".\n\nFriday is considered to be an unlucky day in some cultures, and perhaps the most enduring sailing superstition is that it is unlucky to begin a voyage or 'set sail' on a Friday. However, this superstition is not universal. In the 19th century Admiral William Henry Smyth, writing in his nautical lexicon \"The Sailor's Word-Book\", described Friday as\n\n(\"Dies Infaustus\" means \"unlucky day\".) This superstition is the root of the well-known urban legend of .\n\nSailors are often reluctant to set sail on Candlemas Day, believing that any voyage begun then will end in disaster. This may be related to the superstition to remove all Christmas decorations by Candlemas, a practice done well into Victorian times.\n\nIn 18th century New England, rolling clouds and roaring waves were thought as bad omens, so sailing on days under such conditions was considered inadvisable.\n\nSirens were mythological, often dangerous and beautiful, creatures, portrayed as femmes fatales who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. They were portrayed in both Greek and Roman mythology as sea deities who lured mariners, and in Roman lore were daughters of Phorcys. In the \"Odyssey\", the hero Odysseus, wishing to hear the sirens' seductive and destructive song, must protect himself and his crew by having his fellow sailors tie him to the mast and then stop their own ears with wax (\"see image\").\n\nIn another myth, Hera, queen of the gods, persuaded the Sirens to enter a singing contest with the Muses, which the Sirens lost; out of their anguish, writes Stephanus of Byzantium, the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera (\"featherless\"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called \"Souda\" (modern Lefkai).\nAnother mythological creature, the Scylla, is a similar female sea demon that is both dangerous yet beautiful. Sirens supposedly \"lured mariners to their deaths with their melodious, enchanting song\", while \"Scylla sent countless sailors to the depths of the sea.\"\n\nThe albatross as a superstitious relic is referenced in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's well-known poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. It is considered very unlucky to kill an albatross; in Coleridge's poem, the narrator killed the bird and his fellow sailors eventually force him to wear the dead bird around his neck.\n\nHaving bananas on a ship, especially on a private boat or fishing yacht, is considered bad luck.\n\nWhistling is usually considered to be bad luck with the possible exception of the sources mentioned below. It is said that to whistle is to challenge the wind itself, and that to do so will bring about a storm. Another tale is that it has been considered bad luck ever since the mutiny aboard HMS \"Bounty\"; Fletcher Christian is said to have used a whistle as the signal to begin the mutiny against Captain William Bligh.\n\nSailors also had a culture of items or practices that were believed to bring good luck, or trinkets to ward off bad luck or the evil eye.\n\nWhile in many cultures, a black cat is considered unlucky, British and Irish sailors considered adopting a black \"ship's cat\" because it would bring good luck. There is some logic to this belief: cats eat (or at least kill) rodents, which can damage ropes and stores of grain on board, and they are intelligent animals, a high level of care was directed toward them to keep them happy, and research has backed up this superstition. Evidence published in 2017 by a geneticist the University of Leuven shows that Egyptian cats spread their mitochondrial DNA through shipping lanes to medieval northern Europe. Preliminary results of that genetic study concluded that cats were also carried on trading ships to control rodents, and that practice was adopted by traders from other nations, including Vikings in northern Germany around the 8th to 11th centuries.\n\nSome sailors believed that polydactyl cats were better at catching pests, possibly connected with the suggestion that extra digits give a polydactyl cat better balance, important when at sea. Cats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. If a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, it was thought that it would summon a terrible storm to sink the ship and that if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Other beliefs included: if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hailstorm was coming; if it sneezed it meant rain; and if it was frisky it meant wind.\n\nCormorants, in some Scandinavian areas, are considered a good omen; in particular, in Norwegian tradition spirits of those lost at sea come to visit their loved ones disguised as cormorants.\n\nWhistling on board a sailing ship is thought to encourage the wind strength to increase. This is regularly alluded to in the Aubrey-Maturin books by Patrick O'Brian.\nOn boats and ships where whistling was taboo, the cook was usually excused, because as long as he was whistling, he was not stealing the food.\n\nTraditionally, a type of kobold, called a Klabautermann, lives aboard ships and helps sailors and fishermen on the Baltic and North Sea in their duties. He is a merry and diligent creature, with an expert understanding of most watercraft, and an irrepressible musical talent. He also rescues sailors washed overboard. The name comes from the Low German verb \"klabastern\" meaning \"rumble\" or \"make a noise\". An etymology deriving the name from the verb \"kalfatern\" (\"to caulk\") has also been suggested. A carved klabautermann image, of a small sailor dressed in yellow with a tobacco pipe and woollen sailor's cap, often carrying a caulking hammer, is attached to the mast as a symbol of good luck. However, despite the positive attributes, there is one omen associated with his presence: no member of a ship blessed by his presence shall ever set eyes on him; he only ever becomes visible to the crew of a doomed ship. The belief in Klabautermänner dates to at least the 1770s.\n\nSailors have had several patron saints.\n\nSaint Nicholas is probably the most famous; according to his hagiography, he calmed a storm by prayer.\n\nSaint Brendan the Navigator is also considered a patron saint of sailors and navigators, due to his mythical voyage to St. Brendan’s Island.\n\nSaint Erasmus of Formiae, also known as Saint Elmo, may have become the patron of sailors because he is said to have continued preaching even after a thunderbolt struck the ground beside him. This prompted sailors, who were in danger from sudden storms and lightning, to claim his prayers. The electrical discharges at the mastheads of ships were read as a sign of his protection and came to be called \"Saint Elmo's Fire\". Thus, Saint Elmo's Fire was usually good luck in traditional sailor's lore, but because it is a sign of electricity in the air and interferes with compass readings, sailors sometimes regarded it as an omen of bad luck and stormy weather.\n\nIt is often considered lucky to touch the collar of a sailor's suit.\n\nMermaids usually are considered lucky, but not universally. In Trinidad and Tobago, sea-dwelling mer-men \"were known to grant a wish, transform mediocrity into genius and confer wealth and power.\"\n\nMermaids appear in British folklore as unlucky omens, both foretelling disaster and provoking it. Several variants of the ballad \"Sir Patrick Spens\" depict a mermaid speaking to the doomed ships. In some versions, she tells them they will never see land again; in others, she claims they are near shore, which they are wise enough to know means the same thing. Mermaids can also be a sign of approaching rough weather, and some have been described as monstrous in size, up to .\n\nHans Christian Andersen's fairy tale \"The Little Mermaid\" was published in 1837. The story was adapted into a Disney film with a bowdlerized plot. In the original version, The Little Mermaid is the youngest daughter of a sea king who lives at the bottom of the sea. To pursue a prince with whom she has fallen in love, the mermaid gets a sea witch to give her legs and agrees to give up her tongue in return. Though she is found on the beach by the prince, he marries another. Told she must stab the prince in the heart to return to her sisters, she can't do it out of love for him. She then rises from the ocean and sees ethereal beings around her who explain that mermaids who do good deeds become daughters of the air, and after 300 years of good service they can earn a human soul. A world-famous statue of the Little Mermaid, based on Andersen's fairy tale, has been in Copenhagen, Denmark since August 1913, with copies in 13 other locations around the world.\n\nSailors would look for mermaid's purses on beaches for signs of mermaids in the area.\n\nDavy Jones is a popular character in sailor's yore, especially of the gothic fictional variety. Davy Jones' Locker is an idiom for the bottom of the sea: the state of death among drowned sailors. It is used as a euphemism for death at sea (to be \"sent to Davy Jones' Locker\"). The origins of the name are unclear, and many theories have been put forth, including an actual David Jones, who was a pirate on the Indian Ocean in the 1630s; a pub owner who kidnapped sailors and then dumped them onto any passing ship; the incompetent Duffer Jones, a notoriously myopic sailor who often found himself over-board; or that Davy Jones is another name for Satan; or \"Devil Jonah\", the biblical Jonah who became the \"evil angel\" of all sailors, who would identify more with the beset-upon ship-mates of Jonah than with the unfortunate man himself. Upon death, a wicked sailor's body supposedly went to Davy Jones' locker (a chest, as lockers were back then), but a pious sailor's soul went to Fiddler's Green. This nautical superstition was popularized in the 19th century.\n\nKraken were legendary sea monsters that may have been based on sightings of giant squids.\n\nIn relation to language and cultural practices, such sailors superstitions are the consequence of folkloric practices or traditions whose meanings were once important signifiers, but now are lost to most modern sailors and laypersons alike.\n\nSailor tattoos are a visual way to preserve the culture of the maritime superstitions. Sailors believed that certain symbols and talismans would help them in when facing certain events in life; they thought that those symbols would attract good luck or bad luck in the worst of the cases:\nFor example, the images of a pig and a hen were good luck; both animals are not capable of swimming, but they believed that God would look down upon a shipwreck and see an animal not capable of swimming and would take them into his hand and place them on land. Another example of superstitions is the North Star (Nautical Star or compass rose); sailors had the belief that by wearing this symbol it would help them to find his or her way home. Sailors designed mariner motifs of their own, according to their travel experiences in the ocean. By the 19th century, about 90% of all United States Navy sailors had tattoos.\n\nThe anchor is commonly used in sailor tattoos.\n\nThe Line-crossing ceremony commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the Equator. Its practices invoke good luck on the new sailor. The ceremony of Crossing the Line is an initiation rite in the Royal Navy, Royal Canadian Navy, U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Marine Corps, and other navies that commemorates a sailor's first crossing of the Equator. The tradition may have originated with ceremonies when passing headlands, and become a \"folly\" sanctioned as a boost to morale, or have been created as a test for seasoned sailors to ensure their new shipmates were capable of handling long rough times at sea. Sailors who have already crossed the Equator are nicknamed (Trusty) \"Shellbacks\", often referred to as \"Sons of Neptune\"; those who have not are nicknamed (Slimy) \"Pollywogs\" (in 1832 the nickname \"griffins\" was noted ).\n\nAfter crossing the line, Pollywogs receive subpoenas to appear before \"King Neptune and his court\" (usually including his first assistant Davy Jones and her Highness Amphitrite and often various dignitaries, who are all represented by the highest ranking seamen), who officiate at the ceremony, which is often preceded by a beauty contest of men dressing up as women. Afterwards, some \"wogs\" may be \"interrogated\" by King Neptune and his entourage. During the ceremony, the Pollywogs undergo a number of increasingly embarrassing ordeals (such as wearing clothing inside out and backwards; crawling on hands and knees; being swatted with short lengths of firehose; kissing the Royal Baby's belly coated with axle grease, etc.), largely for the entertainment of the Shellbacks. Once the ceremony is complete, a Pollywog receives a certificate declaring his new status.\n\nU.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt described his Crossing the Line ceremony aboard the \"Happy Ship\" \"USS Indianapolis\" with his \"Jolly Companions\" in a letter to his wife Eleanor Roosevelt on 26 November 1936:\n\nThe phrase \"over a barrel\", meaning to be in a dilemma or \"a weak or difficult position\", may refer to the first aid practice amongst sailors of placing a drowning victim's head over a barrel, and rolling his body over it, in an attempt to remove aspirated water from the person's lungs. However, this etymology is challenged, and may come instead from the custom of punishing a prisoner by flogging or paddling him while he is strapped to a barrel; there is no documentary evidence it was actually used specifically as a nautical phrase. Either way, the image created in the mind is that of total helplessness and loss of control, which is a common anxiety of sailors in fear of corporal punishment.\n\n"}
{"id": "545562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=545562", "title": "Service-learning", "text": "Service-learning\n\nService-learning is an educational approach that combines learning objectives with community service in order to provide a pragmatic, progressive learning experience while meeting societal needs.\n\nService-learning involves students in service projects to apply classroom learning for local agencies that exist to effect positive change in the community. The National Youth Leadership Council defines service learning as \"a philosophy, pedagogy, and model for community development that is used as an instructional strategy to meet learning goals and/or content standards\".\n\nAuthor Barbara Jacoby defines service-learning as \"a form of experiential education in which students engage in activities that address human and community needs together with structured opportunities for reflection designed to achieve desired learning outcomes\".\n\nAs defined by Robert Sigmon, 1994:\n\nService-learning, as defined by Robert Sigmon, \"occurs when there is a balance between learning goals and service outcomes.\" As follows, there are various methods of hands-on learning that fall into this category, these include:\n\nThe purpose of service learning is, in essence, to, \"equally benefit the provider and the recipient of the service as well as to ensure equal focus on both the service being provided and the learning that is occurring.\" Volunteerism, community service, internships, and field education all exemplify, in some way or another, the core value of service learning, as all of them benefit the student as well as the one they served to an equal degree, the only difference being how material the benefit is. These methods also tend to focus on ensuring that the student not only serves, but learns something, whether it is interpersonal skills, work experience in their future field, or a change in how they view themselves and others.\n\nIn \"Service-learning: History, Theory, and Issues\", Bruce W. Speck and Sherry Lee Hoppe say that John Dewey's writings on the active nature of understanding and the benefits of and conditions for participatory democracy \"provide an early theoretical foundation for a pedagogy in which students cooperatively engage actual social problems\". In \"Building partnerships for service-learning\", Barbara Jacoby writes that Service-learning \"is based on the work of researchers and theorists on learning, including John Dewey, Jean Piaget, Kurt Lewin, Donald Schon, and David Kolb, who believe that we learn through combinations of action and reflection.\"\n\nIn 1979 Robert Sigmon called for a more precise definition in \"Service-Learning: Three Principles\", in which he said the term, which was relatively new, was being used to describe a number of different volunteer actions and experiential education programs.\nSigmon wrote that, in the late 1960s, the Southern Regional Education Board (SREB) popularized a service-learning internship model, that defined service-learning as \"the integration of the accomplishment of a public task with conscious educational growth.\"\n\nIn 1992 Maryland adopted statewide service-learning requirements for high school graduation.\nIn the same year, the District of Columbia also adopted such requirements.\n\nA number of other states have allowed credit toward graduation for service-learning/community service.\n\nJanet Eyler outlines the different ways student learn through service-learning in the book \"Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?\". First, there is interpersonal learning, in which students re-evaluate personal values and motivations by channeling a passionate interest to service-learning projects, as well as build a connection and commitment to the community. The second form is academic material that is taught through practical application and reflective instruction, so that it may be practiced outside classrooms and test-taking. Janet Eyler explains, \"it is the product of continuous challenge to old conceptions and reflection on new ways to organize information and use the new material.\" Thirdly is cognitive development where students are challenged to use critical thinking and problem-solving skills in a context that provides additional information and experience for student evaluation, because service-learning deals with numerous problems in complex situations. The fourth form is transformation within the students, which \"is about thinking about things in a new way and moving in new direction—creating a new picture without relying on the old lines.\" Finally, service-learning focuses on effective citizenship and behavioral issues, and this helps the students better understand social issues relevant to their own community. Learning in all these ways makes service-learning effective to those serving as well as those being served, for \"learning begins with the impact of service-learning on the personal and interpersonal development of the students.\"\n\nAccording to Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles, there are numerous benefits to the service-learning approach. It provides experiential learning that connects personal and interpersonal development with cognitive and academic advancement, providing opportunities for personal connections and ultimately transformation. Those serving may encounter certain social problems for the first time, thus transforming their view on the world. Beyond that, students may be transformed in the way of developing better problem-solving skills to address those problems about which they now know. A service-learning experience may be the catalyst in the life of a student to dive into the complexities of the social issues they have encountered and to seek to develop innovative solutions.\n\nService learning combines both experiential learning and community service.\n\nIn order for students to receive college credit for service-learning courses, a substantial amount of academic learning needs to accompany the service. Janet Eyler outlines several impacts of learning that she believes evolves from service-learning. The first impact is Personal Connections. When a person is passionate about a certain topic or cause, they will more likely want to make a difference by trying to mend the area with which they are passionate about. Lifelong learners develop from students who are personally connected with their passion. Secondly, the usefulness of service-learning, according to Eyler, can impact a student for the rest of their lives. Eyler points that learning the material for a test or exam in a classroom is one thing, but actually pulling that knowledge out and using it in new circumstances or in problems that arise in everyday life is another thing. Students have the chance to practice what they learn in the classroom by encountering life problems and have a chance to develop skill in how to develop solutions for the problems they face. The development of learning is the third impact that Eyler explains. She writes that much of the knowledge that students have is not self-consumed, but rather developed from training obtained from the classroom and from daily life. Any thought or active development attained during service is more liable to impact the student, and the students' surroundings. The fourth impact that Eyler explains is the transformational aspect of service-learning. Students who participate in service are can be likely to develop different ways of thinking and approaching life. It may be a service-learning course that impacts the students' frame of thinking, while transforming the community as well. Finally, the fifth impact of learning is finding citizenship in our communities. While the students are serving and impacting the community, they are very likely to find their role in society. Students can realize that they can make a difference and do have a part in their community. This realization can lead to citizenship, and active and acknowledged place in community. These five by-products of learning, as Janet Eyler outlines, are important to the progression of learning in service-learning.\n\nAccording to Eyler and Giles Jr., who conducted nationwide studies on service-learning, factors which influence its impact on students include placement quality, duration, and reflection.\n\nAccording to Eyler and Giles, \"\"Placement quality\" refers to the extent that students in their community placements are challenged, are active rather than observers, do a variety of tasks, feel that they are making a positive contribution, have important levels of responsibility, and receive input and appreciation from supervisors in the field.\" According to their research, placement quality has measurable effects on such things as \"personal development outcomes,\" \"increased leadership and communication skill,\" and connection to community, faculty, and other students.\n\nIn \"The Importance of Program Quality in Service-Learning,\" Eyler and Giles state: \"a program or a sequence of experiences needs to be of a long enough duration to have a developmental impact.\" This view is expanded upon by Alexander W. Astin and Linda J. Sax. In their opinion, \"the amount of time devoted to providing service carries additional benefits beyond those benefits associated with the type of service performed, especially in the areas of civic responsibility and life skill development.\"\n\nBut how much time is enough? According to J. Beth Mabry, \"students should spend at least fifteen to nineteen hours in their service activities to have adequate exposure to the people and issues their service addresses.\"\n\nAn essential feature of service-learning programs, reflection is a period of critical thinking performed by the student. For many advocates of the pedagogy, reflection may symbolize the learning that occurs in the student. Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles provide an example of this opinion in their book, \"Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?\" when they state: \"learning occurs through a cycle of action and reflection, not simply through being able to recount what has been learned through reading and lecture.\" Also, the National Service Learning Clearinghouse considers reflection to be a \"core component\" of service-learning.\n\nSome higher education programs require a reflection component in their service-learning classes. The University of Minnesota is one such institution that includes required reflection activities with its service learning classes.\n\nReflection may be done individually or as a group activity. Wartburg College in Indiana published a list of reflection activity suggestions on their website. These included various types of journaling, brainstorming as a group, using quotes, writing essays and papers, structured class discussions, and class presentations among other ideas.\n\nEffective service-learning programs also include required written reflection. Not only does writing permanently record a student's service-learning experience, but it also provides a helpful tool for continued reflection long after the program has been completed. Written reflection assignments also require students to stop, think, and articulate their learning. This evaluation is of incredible value to students.\n\nHigh quality placements are a key to the success of a service-learning program. This requires the service learning establishment to have a broad network of connections within the community. Students need to have a positive connection with the establishment they're serving in order to maximize their learning.\n\nDiversity is also a component of a successful service-learning program. By working with people of different ethnicities, lifestyles, and socioeconomic statuses, a student's learning and tolerance will increase. By serving in a diverse learning environment, student are more likely to reduce stereotypes and increase their cultural appreciation. This can help a student learn how to more effectively serve a broader array of people.\n\nThe Service in Service Learning takes knowledge outside the classroom into the real world with real people and situations.  In his book \"Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty\", Muhammad Yunus states that \"If a university is a repository for knowledge, then some of this knowledge should spill over to the neighboring community. A university must not be an island where academics reach out to higher and higher levels of knowledge without sharing any of their findings.\"\n\nService brings community together as a whole, towards a common goal or purpose. Service is about what is for someone else. The action of service in and among the community, provides chances for sociocultural norms and prejudices to be removed. While some have questioned the positive effect and collective interest of the \"service\" side of service-learning, among those who perform the services, it has been made known that many would say otherwise.\n\nBased upon various studies, students who participate in service-learning courses or projects seem to encounter a multitude of benefits. The book \"Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?\" discusses the effects of service learning on students, as well service learning in general.\n\nIn addition to interpersonal skills students have also reported developing personal leadership skills. Another benefit seen is that it can also develop a sense of meaning and purpose in their academics. \n\nThough one might not immediately think of serving others as affecting oneself, studies have found that \"coming into contact with people whose life experiences and assumptions about the world are different calls one's own world into question.\" Not only does the service experience move one to examine his own life, but it also allows him to produce a better version of himself. In their book, \"Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?\" Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr. identify five key personal growth outcomes of service-learning: self-knowledge, spiritual growth, the reward of helping others, career benefits and careers in service, and changes in personal efficacy. As one goes out into the community with the intent of reaching out to those within it, this broader social context causes one to see himself more clearly.\n\nBeing involved in the educational process of service-learning also strengthens one's critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which is vital to facing modern-day dilemmas. This will transform a person's prior way of thinking, for critical thinking stimulates people to question assumptions and to \"color outside the lines\". According to Eyler and Giles Jr., \"Transformative thinking is about thinking about things in a new way and moving in new directions—creating a new picture without relying on the old lines\".\n\nIt is in this way that service-learning motivates individuals to become better citizens of their communities. Many of those interested in reforming higher education have found that this experiential pedagogy helps to \"cultivate civic and social responsibility as part of education for citizenship\". As individuals acquire knowledge about serving those around them, they can apply that knowledge to community problems, thus being able to make a greater difference in the world. People who realize their responsibility to their community will naturally develop into more productive members of society. \n\nService-learning begins in the heart and mind of the individual; he must understand himself before he can attempt to understand others. This will prompt him to develop personal connections with those whom he is serving, for it is within community involvement where one's own understanding and knowledge are transformed.\n\nResearchers have found that these personal and interpersonal gains from engaging in service-learning classes where higher when the programs were of better quality. The biggest predictor of increased learning in communication skills was the high placement quality that the students were put into, allowing them to develop and \"hone\" their skills.\n\nMany experience interpersonal development through the service learning process. According to \"Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?\", among the students in their survey, \"40 percent reported that learning to work with others was among the most important things they learned from service-learning, and 81 percent indicated that it was the most or very important.\" Learning to work with others is crucial for job placement in our world today. Another effect this has on the students is that they are more apt to learn how to lead. By working with others, the students are given opportunities to be more responsible and take initiative. Service-learning also encourages connection within the community. Truly, many learned how to listen to the voice of their communities. Not only that, but it helps form friendships and find other like-minded individuals who are involved with service learning. Above all it helps students to feel as though they are making a difference and matter to their communities. It was also found that quantity and quality of reflective discussion was linked to the outcome of feeling a closeness among the community and other students. An even more powerful outcome was the creation of a bond between a student and faculty member. In most classroom settings there's little room for a deep relationship between the student and teacher, while in service-learning often student and teacher will work alongside each other and develop a more lasting bond. As stated in \"Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?\", \"Service participants in their assessment of Learn and Serve America were more likely than their peers to spend at least an hour a week interacting with a faculty member.\" Service-learning has a tremendous impact on students and how they learn, but also how they interact with others.\n\nService-learning offers an opportunity for students to experience different cultures, which in turn reduces many negative and unnecessary stereotypes derived by inexperienced students. The appreciation of different cultures in service-learning happens because of the interaction that often occurs while completing a service. A survey on students who participated in service-learning finds that, \"63 percent reported interacting with those receiving services at least fairly often, 60 percent reported frequent interaction with other volunteers, 51 percent felt that professionals at the placement site often took an interest in them, and 57 percent reported that they had frequent chances to work with people from ethnic groups other than their own.\"\n\nOne of the goals of service-learning is positive interactions.\n\nPeople often only distinguish the differences between other cultures and communities and their own. These perceived differences often influence the decisions made when interacting with people of other cultures. Service-learning provides the opportunity for students to not only appreciate other cultures, but to appreciate their shared humanity.\n\nService learning programs have developed rapidly within the last 30 years. From 1995–1997, 458 universities received grants from the Corporation for National Service's Learn and Serve Higher Education (LASHE) which enabled 3,000 new service-learning courses to be developed to the benefit of more than 60 students per course.\n\nMuch of the research on the effects of service-learning is focused on what students learn through their service to the community; fewer studies have been conducted on the impact of service-learning on the communities where the students serve. Several studies that have been done on this topic measure the impact of service-learning on the community organizations with which college students volunteer, seeking to understand the organizations' perspectives on service-learning.\n\nOne positive impact of service-learning on these organizations is the presence of more volunteers, which enables the organizations to accomplish more and to serve more clients. Students can use specific skills they possess to benefit the organization, and can be a source of new ideas, energy, and enthusiasm. Through partnering with a college or university, the organization can gain access to new knowledge and opportunities to connect with other organizations that have partnered with the same school.\n\nService-learning has been applied across a host of cultural settings, including numerous Native American communities. Guffey (1997) notes credible service learning begins with tribal ways of knowing and value systems, which is to say that outsiders should not impose service learning projects. Rather, tribal communities should devise projects that reflect needs unique to the community being served. This parallels Matthew Fletcher's (2010) assertion that tribes, and other historically marginalized communities, should unique develop educational programs, as opposed to merely adopting Westernized forms of education. \n\nAccording to this view, service learning provides a pedagogical framework for tribes to address community needs. One such example is provided by Sykes, Pendley, and Deacon (2017) who provide a qualitative case study of a tribally-initiated service learning project embedded within a partnership at a research university. This case is unique in that it recounts how service learning students (who were also tribal members) came to collectively understand their responsibilities of citizenship through service. Moreover, tribal elders came to appreciate the importance of young citizens in maintaining and growing tribal culture. Thus, service learning can also be a means to explore cultural identity.\n\nThere are numerous critiques of service-learning. In 1979, Robert Sigmon acknowledged criticisms that called service-learning, \"a utopian vision\" and \"too demanding and impractical\". He called for research into outcomes related to service-learning. Towson University Professor John Egger, writing in the Spring 2008 issue of the journal \"Academic Questions\", argued that service learning does not really teach useful skills or develop cultural knowledge. Instead, Egger maintained, service learning mainly involves the inculcation of communitarian political ideologies. Tulane Professor Carl L. Bankston III has described his own university's policy of mandating service learning as the imposition of intellectual conformity by the university administration on both students and faculty. According to Bankston, by identifying specific types of civic engagement as worthy community service, the university was prescribing social and political perspectives. He argued that this was inconsistent with the idea that individuals in a pluralistic society should choose their own civic commitments and that it was contrary to the ideal of the university as a site for the pursuit of truth through the free exchange of ideas.\n\nHowever, these organizations face challenges in working with the students. Communication with faculty is often inconsistent, so organizations do not always understand their roles and the roles of the faculty in students' service projects. Some organizations' representatives stated that faculty assigned students projects that were not allowed in their organization. Often the demographics of students do not match well with the demographics of the clients they serve, which can make it difficult for the students to relate to the clients or create an uncomfortable situation for the clients. The academic calendar students follow tends not to work well with the organizations' schedules, since students' volunteering schedules are interrupted for holiday breaks, finals, and other activities. Also, the small number of hours students are required to spend volunteering can cause problems for organizations and their clients. Some organizations require more hours for volunteer training than students are required to volunteer, and making a personal connection with clients only to break it off soon after can be more hurtful than helpful.\n\nRepresentatives of community organizations where service-learning students volunteer expressed interest in working with colleges and universities to change service-learning programs so that they work more smoothly for the organizations. Their suggestions included establishing more consistent communication between faculty and organizations, creating longer-term partnerships between colleges and community organizations, and ensuring that the students and their projects are matched well with the organizations they serve.\n\nIn \"Downsizing Democracy: How America Sidelined Its Citizens and Privatized Its Public\", Matthew A. Crenson and Benjamin Ginsberg question whether service-learning is contributing to privatizing or downsizing citizenship practices. Responding to this, Christopher Koliba wrote that education providers may have the opportunity to change this trend.\n\n\nMany engineering faculty members believe the educational solution lies in taking a more constructivist approach, where students construct knowledge and connections between nodes of knowledge as opposed to passively absorbing knowledge. Educators see service learning as a way to both implement a constructivism in engineering education as well as match the teaching styles to the learning styles of typical engineering students. As a result, many engineering schools have begun to integrate service learning into their curricula and there is now a journal dedicated to service learning in engineering.\n\nIn \"Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?\", Janet Eyler and Dwight E. Giles Jr. wrote, \"Although fewer students chose spiritual growth as an important outcome of service-learning—20 percent selecting it as among the most important things they learned and 46 percent selecting it as very or most important—it was important to many students...Some saw service as a definite opportunity to fulfill their religious commitment.\"\n\nService-learning has both a service and a learning component. Eyler and Giles Jr. in \"Where's the Learning in Service-Learning?\" apply the term service-learning \"to programs where the two foci are in balance, and study and action are explicitly integrated.\n\nEyler and Giles Jr. have found that service-learning students, upon reflecting on their experience, find reward in helping others and in developing close personal relationships. The second focus in the term \"service-learning\", that of \"learning\", is defined by R. L. Atkinson as \"a relatively permanent change in behavior that results from practice\".\n\nIn addition to the \"service\" and \"learning\" components stressed by Eyler and Giles, author David Bornstein references motivation in service. In \"How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas\", he states: \"The key difference [between highly successful and average entrepreneurs has] more to do with the quality of their motivation.\"\n\nService learning is about taking the student out of the classroom and placing them in an environment where they can make a difference while also learning. Service learning strengthens not just the community that is being helped but the person who is giving their time and effort to their cause, which benefits them socially, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. For many service learning is simply tending to basic human needs: food, water, clothes, and housing. Some organizations, such as The Salvation Army, also seek to attend to the spiritual side of service learning. They used the motto \"soup, soap, and salvation\" to show what they wanted to do with their ministry. \"The Salvation Army sees no conflict between spiritual and social ministry. It seeks to serve people so as to satisfy both the spiritual and social dimensions of their needs.\"\n\nOne contributor to the study of service learning is Alexander Astin. Astin, the Allan M. Cartter Distinguished Professor of Higher Education Emeritus and founding director of both Cooperative Institutional Research Program and Higher Education Research Institute, formed a Theory of Involvement. This theory explains how student involvement in co-curricular activities positively affects college outcomes. Through a 1998 study of college seniors, Astin demonstrated that service greatly improves critical thinking skills.\n\nNadinne I. Cruz works as an independent consultant. She gained enthusiasm for the cause of service learning through her work in the Philippines. Now, she is an advocate of service learning who argues that only a small portion of skills needed to address life’s problems can be learned through traditional academia. Other skills, such as courage, forgiveness, and stewarding the earth, must be learned elsewhere. Therefore, she recommends service learning and community engagement, which “offer learning with and from wise people, who teach by example.”\n\nAndrew Furco, Associate Vice President for Public Engagement at the University of Minnesota and a professor, has contributed a variety of literature to service learning, including two books: Service-Learning: The Essence of the Pedagogy and Service-Learning Through a Multidisciplinary Lens, which he co-authored with S. Billig. He gives five reasons engagement programs differ from engaged universities: “Engagement differs from outreach… is at the heart of the university’s identity… focuses on partnerships… is with, not to, for, or in communities… is about institutional transformation.”\n\nOne other service-learning notable is James Kielsmeier. Kielsmeier founded the National Youth Leadership Council, a nonprofit that became the service-learning movement. Kielsmeier posits that service learning involves a change in how schools see young people: from “resource users, recipients, and victims” to “contributors, givers, and leaders”.\n\n"}

No scanning is involved with this method and the lack of moving parts means that motion artifacts should be avoided. This instrument typically features detector arrays with a high number of pixels.\n\nAlthough the first known reference to a snapshot hyperspectral imaging device—the Bowen \"image slicer\"—dates from 1938, the concept was not successful until a larger amount of spatial resolution was available. With the arrival of large-format detector arrays in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a series of new snapshot hyperspectral imaging techniques were developed to take advantage of the new technology: a method which uses a fiber bundle at the image plane and reformatting the fibers in the opposite end of the bundle to a long line, viewing a scene through a 2D grating and reconstructing the multiplexed data with computed tomography mathematics, the (lenslet-based) integral field spectrograph, a modernized version of Bowen's image slicer. More recently, a number of research groups have attempted to advance the technology in order to create devices capable of commercial use. These newer devices include the HyperPixel Array imager a derivative of the integral field spectragraph, a multiaperture spectral filter approach, a compressive-sensing–based approach using a coded aperture, a microfaceted-mirror-based approach, a generalization of the Lyot filter, and a generalization of the Bayer filter approach to multispectral filtering \n\nWhile snapshot instruments are featured prominently in the research literature, none of these instruments have seen wide adoption in commercial use (i.e. outside the professional astronomical community) due to manufacturing limitations. Thus, their primary venue continues to be astronomical telescopes. One of the main reasons for the popularity of snapshot devices in the astronomical community is that they offer large increases in the light collection capacity of a telescope when performing hyperspectral imaging. Recent applications have been in soil spectroscopy and vegetation sciences.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "696542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=696542", "title": "The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism", "text": "The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism\n\nThe Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism is a book written by Max Weber, a German economist and sociologist. It was first published in German under the title Konfuzianismus und Taoismus in 1915 and an adapted version appeared in 1920. An English translation was published in 1951 and several editions have been released since.\n\nIt was his second major work on the sociology of religion, after \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". Weber focused on those aspects of Chinese society that were different from those of Europe and Puritanism, and posed a question why capitalism did not develop in China. From the chronological perspective, he concentrated on early period of Chinese history (Hundred Schools of Thought, Warring States period), during which major Chinese schools of thoughts (Confucianism, Taoism) were invented. In that period, he focused on the issues of Chinese urban development, Chinese patrimonialism and officialdom, and Chinese religion, as the areas in which Chinese development differed most distinctively from the European route.\n\nWeber's choice of topics and analysis inspired further attention and critique. The sociologist of Chinese religion C.K. Yang, for instance, wrote that Weber's interpretation is \"largely the result of viewing the religious situation in Chinese culture from the view of the Christian world, where religion has a formal organizational system and has occupied a prominent structural position in the organizational scheme of Western society.\" \n\nThe sociologist Andreas Buss wrote in 1985 that many Western scholars felt the so-called \"Weber-thesis” belonged to a “bygone era” yet it continued to inspire discussion and reference. He cautioned that English language scholars would find it difficult to read Weber. One problem is that Weber did not intend the essays on China and India to be read separately or as definitive treatments. His purpose was to sketch selected elements in Indian or Chinese culture to contrast with and test his essay “The Protestant Ethic and the Rise of Capitalism.” The essay on Confucianism and Taoism was published in English under “misleading” title, \"The Religion of China\", a title which does “not at all reflect Weber’s intentions”. In addition, Buss continued, the translations are of “poor quality”, even a “disgrace”, and add to the misunderstanding that Weber over-generalized.\n\nWeber based much of his analysis on the early period of Chinese history. By 200 B.C., the Chinese state had emerged from a loose federation of feudal states of the Warring States period to the unified empire with patrimonal rule. Confucianism emerged to dominate the other schools that had developed in the fertile social upheavals of pre-imperial China such as Daoism (Taoism), Mohism, and Legalism, all of which had criticised Confucianism (c. 400–c. 200 B.C.). One of Confucius's disciples, Mencius, (c. 372–c. 289 B.C.) developed a more idealistic version of Confucianism, while Xunzi (Hsün Tzu, c.313–c.238 B.C.) argued that all inclinations are shaped by acquired language and other social forms. Confucianism rose to the position of an official orthodoxy during the Han dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220).\n\nWhen the Han disintegrated, Confucianism fell with it and lay dormant for almost 400 years (A.D. 220-618) as Chinese Buddhism and Taoism offered new visions. China was again unified, by the Tang Dynasty (618–906). During the Song (Sung) dynasty (960–1279), Neo-Confucianism flourished — interpreting classical Confucian doctrine in a way that addressed Buddhist and Daoist issues. In the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), Wang Yangming claimed that the mind projects \"li\" (principle) onto things rather than just noticing external \"li\". 20th-century Chinese intellectuals blamed Confucianism for the scientific and political backwardness of China after the disastrous conflicts with Western military technology at the dawn of the modern era.\n\nSimilar to Europe, Chinese cities were founded as forts or leader's residences and were the centers of trade and crafts. However, they never received political autonomy and in fact sometimes had fewer rights than villages. Likewise, its citizens had no special political rights or privileges; the resident of Chinese cities never constituted a separate status class like the residents of European cities.\n\nThe lack of city development is partially due to strengths of kinship ties, which stems from religious beliefs (in ancestral spirits) and maintaining strong ties to the villages in which one's ancestors lived. The guilds likewise competed against each other for the favour of the Emperor, never uniting in order to fight for more rights.\n\nUnlike eternally divided Europe, China saw early unification and establishment of imperial government with a centralized officialdom. Relatively peaceful centuries in the first centuries of Chinese history meant that military never gained significant authority when the power structure was being formed. This meant that the focus of struggle for political power turned from the distribution of land to the distribution of offices, which with their fees and taxes were the most prominent source of income for the holder. The state depended on the services of those freely removable and non-hereditary officials, rather than on the service of military (knights), like in Europe. The officialdom nonetheless had significant powers, and its vested interests were in preserving the \"status quo\", opposing any reforms or changes, particularly on a governmental level.\n\nFor the members of the officialdom, it was their rank, or status, which was of prime importance. The 'superior' man (literati) should stay away from the pursuit of wealth (though not from the wealth itself). Therefore, becoming a civil servant was preferred to becoming a businessman and granted a much higher status class. Literati did not care about the wealth, although they could and did care about their status. As Weber wrote:\n\nChinese civilization had no religious prophecy nor a powerful priesthood social class. The emperor was the high priest of the state religion and the supreme ruler. Weber emphasized that Confucianism tolerated the simultaneous existence of many popular cults and made no effort to organize them as part of a religious doctrine, while nonetheless curtailing the political ambitions of their priests. Instead it taught adjustment to the world.\n\nThis forms a sharp contrast with medieval Europe, where the Church was often able to superimpose its will over those of secular rulers, and where the same, singular religion was the religion of rulers, nobility and the common folk.\n\nAccording to Confucianism, the worship of great deities was the affair of the state, ancestral worship is required of all, and a multitude of popular cults are tolerable. Confucianism tolerated magic and mysticism as long as they were useful tools for controlling the masses; it denounced them as heresy and suppressed them when they threatened the established order (hence the opposition to Buddhism). Another notable quality was the avoidance of both irrational ecstasy and excitement, as well as mystic contemplation and metaphysical speculation.\n\nNote that in this context Confucianism can be referred to as the state cult, and Taoism as the popular religion.\n\nWeber argued that, while several factors were good for development of a capitalist economy (long periods of peace, improved control of rivers, population growth, freedom to acquire land and move outside of native community, freedom of choosing the occupation), they were outweighed by others (mostly stemming from religion) in China:\n\nAccording to Weber, Confucianism and Puritanism are mutually exclusive types of rational thought, each attempting to prescribe a way of life based on religious dogma. Notably, they both valued self-control and restraint, and did not oppose accumulation of wealth.\n\nHowever, to both those qualities where just means to the final goal, and here they were divided by a key difference. The Confucianism goal was \"a cultured status position\", while Puritanism's goal was to create individuals who are \"tools of God\". The intensity of belief and enthusiasm for action were rare in Confucianism, but common in Protestantism. Actively working for wealth was unbecoming a proper Confucian. Therefore, Weber states that it was this difference in social attitudes and mentality, shaped by the respective, dominant religions, that contributed to the development of capitalism in the West and the absence of it in China.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25959082", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25959082", "title": "Voting gender gap in the United States", "text": "Voting gender gap in the United States\n\nThe voting gender gap typically refers to the difference in the percentage of men and women voting for a particular candidate. It is calculated by subtracting the percentage of women supporting a candidate from the percentage of men supporting a candidate (e.g., if 55 percent of men support a candidate and 44 percent of women support the same candidate, there is an 11 point gender gap).\n\nContrary to many popular media accounts, gender gaps are not the within gender differences in candidate support, nor are they the aggregate total of men's and women's within gender differences (e.g., men +10 Republican and women +12 Democrat is not equivalent to a 22 point gender gap).\n\nGender differences in support for political candidates in the United States predate woman suffrage. Even the nation's first president, George Washington, may have had different rates of support among his male and female constituents. Scholarly analyses of letters and newspapers of the founding period suggest that women's support for Washington exceeded that of their male contemporaries.\n\nVery little was written about gender differences in vote choice for the 60 years following the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. Although the Amendment gave women the right to vote in national elections, many women were still reluctant participants in the electoral process. However, post-hoc analyses of American National Election Studies data indicate that majorities of women supported different candidates than majorities of men at least since the organization began to collect data on American elections. Through 1960, these preferences skewed Republican, with women more likely to support Thomas Dewey in 1948, Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, and Richard M. Nixon in 1960. However, men were more likely to support Barry Goldwater's 1964 Republican candidacy, as well as Nixon's 1968 and 1972 campaigns. There was little evidence of a difference in male and female vote choice in the post-Watergate 1976 election between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.\n\nThis changed with the 1980 presidential election between Carter and Republican nominee Ronald Reagan. For the first time, pollsters noted gender differences in candidate preference even before Election Day. These predictions were realized when the final vote tallies revealed was an 8 percentage point gap in women's support for Carter over Reagan. Eleanor Smeal, then director of the National Organization for Women, is credited as being the first to refer to these differences as \"gender gaps\". In post-election analyses, Smeal and others attributed the gap to the Republican Party's reluctance to endorse feminist positions. Namely, the party refused to endorse the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In addition, the party's 1980 platform took a pro-life position on abortion, making it the first major party to take a specific stance on the increasingly politicized issue.\n\nThe size of the gender gap in presidential elections has ranged from a low of 4 percentage points in the 1992 election between George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and third-party candidate Ross Perot to 11 percentage points in both the 1996 election between Clinton and Bob Dole and the 2016 contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Gender gaps in presidential elections usually average about 8 percentage points, though they may vary with the candidates, platforms, and salient issues in each contest.\nThe development of a gender gap in congressional and gubernatorial elections lagged behind its presidential counterpart, though by the mid-1990s, its magnitude reached relatively similar proportions, averaging approximately 9 percentage points. It has persisted in recent midterm election years, measuring 4 percentage points in 2006, 6 percentage points in 2010, and 10 percentage points in 2014.\n\nPre-election forecasts of the 2018 midterm elections suggest the potential for the largest gender gap ever recorded. These predictions are affected by a surge in opposition to Republican President Trump, activation of women as political actors through actions such as the Women's Marches in 2017 and 2018, and increased efforts to recruit women candidates, particularly Democrats. In addition, women tend to outvote men at higher rates in congressional than presidential elections.\n\nThe earliest differences in vote choice were attributed to women's higher rates of religiosity, as well as their lower levels of education, income, and rates of union membership. These traits, it was believed, made women more conservative than their male counterparts, and less likely to identify with President Franklin Roosevelt's Democratic New Deal coalition.\n\nAfter the 1980 election, scholars began to reassess the causes of the apparent shift in women's party loyalties toward the Democratic Party. Researchers hypothesized that these changes may have been the result of an increasing emphasis on women's issues such as the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion. However, there was little evidence that men and women held different positions on these wedge issues. Self-identified feminist men and women, however, did appear to take different stances than their non-feminist counterparts.\n\nAfter more careful examination, scholars discovered that the reemergence and growth of gender gaps in American vote choice and party identification were less the result of women becoming more liberal and more supportive of the Democratic Party, but rather men's gradual movement toward the Republican Party. This shift in party loyalties began during the 1960s, when the Democratic Party under the leadership of Lyndon Johnson began to take increasingly assertive positions on civil rights issues. It became increasingly pronounced in late 1980s and early 1990s, as Southern white men, who formerly identified as Southern Democrats, shifted their loyalties to the Republican Party. In addition, women continue to be more likely than men to identify as independents or weak partisans.\n\nSome scholars argue that key differences in men's and women's partisanship and vote choice are largely attributable to their different positions on political issues. In particular, scholars have found that women are more likely to support a larger national government, increased gun control regulations, the legalization of same-sex marriage, and pro-choice positions on abortion. Women also tend to express higher levels of support on compassion issues such as welfare and health policy, issue positions that scholars argue may be an extension of women's greater propensity to feel and express empathy.\n\nHowever, on some policy issues, such as school prayer and drug use, women tend to be more conservative than their male counterparts. In still other issue areas, there is no compelling evidence for a significant gap between men and women.\n\nThe significance of the gender gap in American politics is magnified because women generally turn out to vote at higher rates than their male counterparts. Scholars argue that this is the result of a greater sense of civic duty among women than men. In addition, due to their longer life expectancy, women also comprise a larger percentage of registered voters than men. Thus, the effects of even small gender gaps in men's and women's vote choice can be magnified, particularly in close elections.\n\nWomen, however, continue to have lower levels of political knowledge, interest, and engagement. They are also less likely to run for office and are underrepresented in elected political positions at the local, state, and national levels.\n"}

He then transitioned into television and in the 1958–59 awards period won both an Emmy and a Producer of the Year award for the \"Alcoa-Goodyear Theatre\" production of \"Eddie.\" He was also nominated for the Producer of the Year award by the Producers Guild of America for his work on \"Mr. Novak\", \"Playhouse 90\" and \"The Twilight Zone\".\n\nAs a writer-producer he went on to write numerous optioned screenplays, one of which was bought by 3 different studios, and wrote and/or produced for such iconic television series as \"Adventures in Paradise\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Bewitched\" and \"Gilligan's Island\". James Michener sent him a telegram congratulating him on the script he wrote for \"Adventures in Paradise\", \"Angel of Death,\" calling it, \"A real achievement.\" His shows were called must-see TV for millions of viewers and fans. He wrote more than 100 scripts for other series' such as \"Bonanza\", \"Quincy M.E.\", \"Paper Chase\" and \"Charlie's Angels\", among other top shows. The pilot for which he served as a producer, \"Adam's Rib\", was accepted into the permanent collection of the Museum of Broadcasting in New York.\n\nFroug was nominated for another Emmy as producer on \"Bewitched\", became executive producer in charge of drama at CBS, and began lecturing at USC's film school before leaving for UCLA as an adjunct professor. He authored numerous books on screenwriters and screenwriting and continued in leadership positions with the Writer's Guild of America West and Producer's Guild of America. In 1987 Froug was honored with the prestigious Valentine Davies Award from the Writers Guild of America, West.\n\nAs a tenured professor at UCLA, he revamped the screenwriting program and taught select graduate level courses. His advanced screenwriting seminars had long wait lists and were the most popular and inspiring courses, according to former students and colleagues. In a 1976 interview for the \"Los Angeles Times,\" Froug was quoted as saying. \"I often tell my students at the first class that if one of them ever sells a screenplay, it will be a minor miracle\". By that time, he had taught more than 500 students at USC and UCLA and said he guessed that fewer than 10 percent of those students would be able to make a career in film, let alone screenwriting. Froug retired from UCLA in 1987. He taught advanced screening writing courses in several countries in addition to colleges in Hawaii and Florida after his retirement. He found much joy in mentoring and was proud of the success of so many of his students.\n\nAs an author, Froug's books were used as textbooks in film schools around the world. In \"The Ultimate Writer's Guide to Hollywood\", author Skip Press describes Froug's \"Screenwriting Tricks of the Trade\" as \"one of the best screenwriting books I've ever read\" and listed the book in his \"Top 10 Hollywood Reads.\"\n\nIn 2011 Froug was selected as one of the Emmy Legends of Television by the Archive of American Television. His interview is available online at EmmyLegends.org\n\nThe UCLA Film and Television Archives hold many of his scripts, interviews and legacy items. The UCSB Special Collection Library holds his extensive research documents on the \"Oklahoma Run\" which he used for a proposed series, \"El Dorado.\"\n\nWilliam Froug was a political and social activist and served on the boards of both the Writers Guild of America, West and Producers Guild of America. In addition, he was a founding member of \"The Caucus for Producers, Writers and Directors\" for which he served as both chair and co-chair over the years. Froug died at the age of 91 in August 2013 in Sarasota, Florida.\n\nRoger Ebert once wrote of Froug, \"I know an old writer. His name is William Froug, he lives in Florida and if you look him up on Amazon, you will see he is still writing brilliant and useful books about screenwriting and teleplays. He is not merely as sharp as a tack, he is the standard by which they sharpen tacks. If he had been advising the kid, the kid would have made a better movie, and if he had been advising the director of 'The Man in the Chair,' we would have been spared the current experience. Just because you're old doesn't mean you have to be a decrepit caricature. One thing that keeps Froug young is that, unlike Flash Madden, he almost certainly does not sit on an expressway overpass guzzling Jack Daniels from a pint bottle.\"\n"}
