Especially in parliamentary systems of government, heads of state often act on the basis of advice issued by prime ministers or other government ministers. For example, in constitutional monarchies, the monarch usually appoints Ministers of the Crown on the advice of his or her prime minister.\n\nAmong the most prominent forms of advice offered are:\n\nIn some states, the duty to accept advice is legally enforceable, having been created by a constitution or statute. For example, the Basic Law of Germany requires the President to appoint federal ministers on the advice of the Chancellor. In others, especially under the Westminster system, advice may legally be rejected; for example, in several Commonwealth realms, the Queen is not legally obliged to accept the advice of her ministers. This lack of obligation forms part of the basis for the Queen's reserve powers. Nevertheless, the convention that the head of state accept ministerial advice is so strong that in ordinary circumstances, refusal to do so would almost certainly provoke a constitutional crisis. \n\nAlthough most advice is binding, in comparatively rare instances it is not. For example, many heads of state may choose not to follow advice on a dissolution of parliament where the government has lost the confidence of that body. In some cases, whether the advice is mandatory or truly just advisory depends on the context and authority of the person offering it. Hence the President of Ireland ordinarily is obliged to dissolve \"Dáil Éireann\" (the House of Representatives) when advised to do so by the \"Taoiseach\" (prime minister). However, where a \"taoiseach\" has (in the words of the Constitution of Ireland) \"ceased to retain the support of a majority in \"Dáil Éireann\"\" (i.e., lost the confidence of parliament) the President has the option of refusing to follow that advice.\n\n"}

This usage originated in the discussion of the history of English-speaking people of the United States and the Spanish-speaking people residing in the western United States during the Mexican–American War.\n\nThe term is ambiguous and used in several different ways. While it is primarily used to refer to people of English ancestry, it (along with terms like \"Anglo\", \"Anglic\", \"Anglophone\", and \"Anglophonic\") also used to denote all people of British or Northern European ancestry or all people of European ethnic origin who speak English as a mother tongue and their descendants in the New World, regardless of their prior racial or ethnic background, much like \"Hispanic\" refers to people of any race. Therefore, a person, for example, of Chinese descent who adopts the American or Canadian culture would have English-speaking \"Anglo-American\", \"Anglic\", \"Anglophone\", \"Anglo\", or \"Anglophonic\" children (in contrast to Spanish-speaking Chinese descent people living in Hispanic America, who would be \"Hispanic\"). Thus, \"Anglo-American\", \"Anglic-American\", \"Anglophone-American\", \"Anglo\", or \"Anglophonic-American\" can refer to all those whose families who, regardless of race or ethnicity, have become mainstream English-speaking people in the United States, English Canada, English-speaking areas of the Caribbean, Belize, and Guyana, including those of African descent.\n\nIn 2017, the Pew Research Center reported that 18% of people who identify as Hispanic in the United States speak English as a first language compared to 90% of non-Hispanics.\n\nThe term implies a relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom (specifically England), or the two countries' shared language, English, and/or cultural heritage. In this context the term may refer to an English American, a person from the United States whose ancestry originates wholly or partly in England, a person from the United States who speaks English as their first language (see American English), a collective term referring to those countries that have similar legal systems based on common law, relations between the United Kingdom and United States, or Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules, a national cataloging code.\n\nThe term is also used, less frequently, to denote a connection between English people (or the English language) and the Western Hemisphere as a whole.

{"id": "308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=308", "title": "Aristotle", "text": "Aristotle\n\nAristotle (; \"Aristotélēs\", ; 384–322 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidiki, in the north of Classical Greece. Along with Plato, he is considered the \"Father of Western Philosophy\". Aristotle provided a complex and harmonious synthesis of the various existing philosophies prior to him, including those of Socrates and Plato, and it was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its fundamental intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be central to the contemporary philosophical discussion.\n\nLittle is known about his life. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects – including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics and government – and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. Teaching Alexander gave Aristotle many opportunities. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books, which were papyrus scrolls. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to empiricism. He believed all concepts and knowledge were ultimately based on perception. Aristotle's views on natural sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.\n\nAristotle's views on physical science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan. Aristotelianism profoundly influenced Islamic thought during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\". His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.\n\nAll aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of academic study. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication. Aristotle has been depicted by major artists including Raphael and Rembrandt. Early Modern theories including William Harvey's circulation of the blood and Galileo Galilei's kinematics were developed in reaction to Aristotle's. In the 19th century, George Boole gave Aristotle's logic a mathematical foundation with his system of algebraic logic. In the 20th century, Martin Heidegger created a new interpretation of Aristotle's political philosophy, but elsewhere Aristotle was widely criticised, even ridiculed by thinkers such as the philosopher Bertrand Russell and the biologist Peter Medawar. More recently, Aristotle has again been taken seriously, such as in the thinking of Ayn Rand and Alasdair MacIntyre, while Armand Marie Leroi has reconstructed Aristotle's biology. The image of Aristotle tutoring the young Alexander remains current, and the \"Poetics\" continues to play a role in the cinema of the United States.\n\nIn general, the details of Aristotle's life are not well-established. The biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.\n\nAristotle, whose name means \"the best purpose\" in Ancient Greek, was born in 384 BC in Stagira, Chalcidice, about 55 km (34 miles) east of modern-day Thessaloniki. His father Nicomachus was the personal physician to King Amyntas of Macedon. Both of Aristotle's parents died when he was about thirteen, and Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. Although little information about Aristotle's childhood has survived, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy.\n\nAt the age of seventeen or eighteen, Aristotle moved to Athens to continue his education at Plato's Academy. He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in 348/47 BC. The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew Speusippus, although it is possible that he feared the anti-Macedonian sentiments in Athens at that time and left before Plato died. Aristotle then accompanied Xenocrates to the court of his friend Hermias of Atarneus in Asia Minor. After the death of Hermias, Aristotle travelled with his pupil Theophrastus to the island of Lesbos, where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon. While in Lesbos, Aristotle married Pythias, either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. In 343 BC, Aristotle was invited by Philip II of Macedon to become the tutor to his son Alexander.\n\nAristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of Macedon. During Aristotle's time in the Macedonian court, he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and Aristotle's own attitude towards Persia was unabashedly ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be \"a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants\". By 335 BC, Aristotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the Lyceum. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with Herpyllis of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, Nicomachus. According to the \"Suda\", he also had an \"erômenos\", Palaephatus of Abydus.\n\nThis period in Athens, between 335 and 323 BC, is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. He wrote many dialogues, of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include \"Physics\", \"Metaphysics\", \"Nicomachean Ethics\", \"Politics\", \"On the Soul\" and \"Poetics\". Aristotle studied and made significant contributions to \"logic, metaphysics, mathematics, physics, biology, botany, ethics, politics, agriculture, medicine, dance and theatre.\"\n\nNear the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but the only evidence of this is an unlikely claim made some six years after the death. Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In 322 BC, Demophilus and Eurymedon the Hierophant reportedly denounced Aristotle for impiety, prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in Chalcis, on Euboea, at which occasion he was said to have stated: \"I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy\" – a reference to Athens's trial and execution of Socrates. He died on Euboea of natural causes later that same year, having named his student Antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.\n\nWith the \"Prior Analytics\", Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th-century advances in mathematical logic. Kant stated in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\" that with Aristotle logic reached its completion.\n\nWhat we today call \"Aristotelian logic\" with its types of syllogism (methods of logical argument), Aristotle himself would have labelled \"analytics\". The term \"logic\" he reserved to mean \"dialectics\". Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the \"Organon\" around 40 BC by Andronicus of Rhodes or others among his followers. The books are:\n\n\nThe order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the \"Categories,\" the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in \"On Interpretation\", to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the \"Analytics\") and dialectics (in the \"Topics\" and \"Sophistical Refutations\"). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory \"stricto sensu\": the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. The \"Rhetoric\" is not conventionally included, but it states that it relies on the \"Topics\".\n\nLike his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the universal. Aristotle's ontology places the universal (\"katholou\") in particulars (\"kath' hekaston\"), things in the world, whereas for Plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate. This means that Aristotle's epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world, and rises to knowledge of the universal, whereas for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal Forms (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, \"form\" is still what phenomena are based on, but is \"instantiated\" in a particular substance. Aristotle uses induction from examples alongside deduction, whereas Plato relies on deduction from \"a priori\" principles.\n\nIn Aristotle's terminology, \"natural philosophy\" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. Aristotle's work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry. Aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as \"science\". Note, however, that his use of the term \"science\" carries a different meaning than that covered by the term \"scientific method\". For Aristotle, \"all science (\"dianoia\") is either practical, poetical or theoretical\" (\"Metaphysics\" 1025b25). His practical science includes ethics and politics; his poetical science means the study of fine arts including poetry; his theoretical science covers physics, mathematics and metaphysics.\n\nThe word \"metaphysics\" appears to have been coined by the first century AD editor who assembled various small selections of Aristotle's works to the treatise we know by the name \"Metaphysics\". Aristotle called it \"first philosophy\", and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science (physics) as the contemplative (\"theoretikē\") philosophy which is \"theological\" and studies the divine. He wrote in his \"Metaphysics\" (1026a16):\n\nAristotle examines the concepts of substance (\"ousia\") and essence (\"to ti ên einai\", \"the what it was to be\") in his \"Metaphysics\" (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form, a philosophical theory called hylomorphism. In Book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the substratum, or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the \"potential\" house, while the form of the substance is the \"actual\" house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other differentia that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.\n\nWith regard to the change (\"kinesis\") and its causes now, as he defines in his \"Physics\" and \"On Generation and Corruption\" 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:\n\nThe coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality (\"dynamis\") and actuality (\"entelecheia\") in association with the matter and the form. Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially (\"dynamei\") plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' (\"poiein\") or 'be acted upon' (\"paschein\"), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting). Actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end (\"telos\") is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.\n\nFor that for the sake of which (\"to hou heneka\") a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see.\n\nIn summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a final cause or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality. With this definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, \"what is it that makes a man one\"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same.\n\nPlato argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyse a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other. Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but \"good\" is still a proper universal form. Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time, and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. Where Plato spoke of the world of forms, a place where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.\n\nAristotle's \"natural philosophy\" spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics, biology and other natural sciences.\n\nIn his \"On Generation and Corruption\", Aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by Empedocles, Earth, Water, Air, and Fire, to two of the four sensible qualities, hot, cold, wet, and dry. In the Empedoclean scheme, all matter was made of the four elements, in differing proportions. Aristotle's scheme added the heavenly Aether, the divine substance of the heavenly spheres, stars and planets.\n\nAristotle describes two kinds of motion: \"violent\" or \"unnatural motion\", such as that of a thrown stone, in the \"Physics\" (254b10), and \"natural motion\", such as of a falling object, in \"On the Heavens\" (300a20). In violent motion, as soon as the agent stops causing it, the motion stops also; in other words, the natural state of an object is to be at rest, since Aristotle does not address friction. With this understanding, it can be observed that, as Aristotle stated, heavy objects (on the ground, say) require more force to make them move; and objects pushed with greater force move faster. This would imply the equation\n\nincorrect in modern physics.\n\nNatural motion depends on the element concerned: the aether naturally moves in a circle around the heavens, while the 4 Empedoclean elements move vertically up (like fire, as is observed) or down (like earth) towards their natural resting places.\n\nIn the \"Physics\" (215a25), Aristotle effectively states a quantitative law, that the speed, v, of a falling body is proportional (say, with constant c) to its weight, W, and inversely proportional to the density, ρ, of the fluid in which it is falling:\n\nAristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite, and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible. Opinions have varied on whether Aristotle intended to state quantitative laws. Henri Carteron held the \"extreme view\" that Aristotle's concept of force was basically qualitative, but other authors reject this.\n\nArchimedes corrected Aristotle's theory that bodies move towards their natural resting places; metal boats can float if they displace enough water; floating depends in Archimedes' scheme on the mass and volume of the object, not as Aristotle thought its elementary composition.\n\nAristotle's writings on motion remained influential until the Early Modern period. John Philoponus (in the Middle Ages) and Galileo are said to have shown by experiment that Aristotle's claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect. A contrary opinion is given by Carlo Rovelli, who argues that Aristotle's physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity, that of objects in the Earth's gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air. In this system, heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones (whether friction is ignored, or not), and they do fall more slowly in a denser medium.\n\nNewton's \"forced\" motion corresponds to Aristotle's \"violent\" motion with its external agent, but Aristotle's assumption that the agent's effect stops immediately it stops acting (e.g., the ball leaves the thrower's hand) has awkward consequences: he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it, resulting in the Medieval theory of impetus.\n\nAristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors. His term \"aitia\" is traditionally translated as \"cause\", but it does not always refer to temporal sequence; it might be better translated as \"explanation\", but the traditional rendering will be employed here.\n\n\nAristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in \"Problems\", book 15. The apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in. With it, he saw that whatever shape he made the hole, the sun's image always remained circular. He also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accidental things, \"from what is spontaneous\". There is also more a specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names \"luck\", that only applies to people's moral choices.\n\nIn astronomy, Aristotle refuted Democritus's claim that the Milky Way was made up of \"those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays,\" pointing out correctly that if \"the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them.\"\n\nAristotle was one of the first people to record any geological observations. He stated that geological change was too slow to be observed in one person's lifetime.\nThe geologist Charles Lyell noted that Aristotle described such change, including \"lakes that had dried up\" and \"deserts that had become watered by rivers\", giving as examples the growth of the Nile delta since the time of Homer, and \"the upheaving of one of the Aeolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption.\"'\n\nAristotle was the first person to study biology systematically, and biology forms a large part of his writings. He spent two years observing and describing the zoology of Lesbos and the surrounding seas, including in particular the Pyrrha lagoon in the centre of Lesbos. His data in \"History of Animals\", \"Generation of Animals\", \"Movement of Animals\", and \"Parts of Animals\" are assembled from his own observations, statements given by people with specialised knowledge such as beekeepers and fishermen, and less accurate accounts provided by travellers from overseas. His apparent emphasis on animals rather than plants is a historical accident: his works on botany have been lost, but two books on plants by his pupil Theophrastus have survived.\n\nAristotle reports on the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and the catches of fishermen. He describes the catfish, electric ray, and frogfish in detail, as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus. His description of the hectocotyl arm of cephalopods, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until the 19th century. He gives accurate descriptions of the four-chambered fore-stomachs of ruminants, and of the ovoviviparous embryological development of the hound shark.\n\nHe notes that an animal's structure is well matched to function, so, among birds, the heron, which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish, has a long neck and long legs, and a sharp spear-like beak, whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet. Darwin, too, noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal, but unlike Aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution. Aristotle's writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution, but while Aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridisations could occur, he saw these as rare accidents. For Aristotle, accidents, like heat waves in winter, must be considered distinct from natural causes. He was thus critical of Empedocles's materialist theory of a \"survival of the fittest\" origin of living things and their organs, and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results. To put his views into modern terms, he nowhere says that different species can have a common ancestor, or that one kind can change into another, or that kinds can become extinct.\n\nAristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense. He used the ancient Greek term \"pepeiramenoi\" to mean observations, or at most investigative procedures like dissection. In \"Generation of Animals\", he finds a fertilised hen's egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryo's heart beating inside.\n\nInstead, he practised a different style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.\n\nFrom the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.\n\nAristotle distinguished about 500 species of animals, arranging these in the \"History of Animals\" in a graded scale of perfection, a \"scala naturae\", with man at the top. His system had eleven grades of animal, from highest potential to lowest, expressed in their form at birth: the highest gave live birth to hot and wet creatures, the lowest laid cold, dry mineral-like eggs. Animals came above plants, and these in turn were above minerals. He grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter \"animals with blood\", and below them the colder invertebrates as \"animals without blood\". Those with blood were divided into the live-bearing (mammals), and the egg-laying (birds, reptiles, fish). Those without blood were insects, crustacea (non-shelled – cephalopods, and shelled) and the hard-shelled molluscs (bivalves and gastropods). He recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale, and noted various exceptions, such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods. To a modern biologist, the explanation, not available to Aristotle, is convergent evolution. He believed that purposive final causes guided all natural processes; this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design.\n\nAristotle's psychology, given in his treatise \"On the Soul\" (\"peri psyche\"), posits three kinds of soul (\"psyches\"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. The human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the \"nous\" (intellect) and \"logos\" (reason).\n\nFor Aristotle, the soul is the form of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement). In contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, he placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain. Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers, with the exception of Alcmaeon.\n\nAccording to Aristotle in \"On the Soul\", memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal \"appearance\" and an occurrence in the past. In other words, a memory is a mental picture (phantasm) that can be recovered. Aristotle believed an impression is left on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when stimuli such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation, Aristotelian 'common sense', and thinking.\n\nAristotle uses the term 'memory' for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation, and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents. Memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. Retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.\n\nBecause Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions, people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences. To search for these impressions, people search the memory itself. Within the memory, if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. Recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another. If the chain of \"images\" is needed, one memory will stimulate the next. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed. Recollection is thus the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression. Only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed.\n\nAristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain impressions, was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity, contrast, and contiguity, described in his Laws of Association. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled.\n\nAristotle describes sleep in \"On Sleep and Wakefulness\". Sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense during sleep they can not have desire, which is the result of sensation. However, the senses are able to work during sleep, albeit differently, unless they are weary.\n\nDreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner. Aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water, and then look away, the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored. However, during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience. During sleep, a person is in an altered state of mind. Aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus. For example, a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings. Since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements, they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams, like the infatuated person. This leads the person to believe the dream is real, even when the dreams are absurd in nature.\n\nOne component of Aristotle's theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs. He claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being. Aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences. Aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, this sensory experience is not part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences.\n\nAristotle's practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics, politics, economics, and rhetoric.\n\nAristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the \"Nicomachean Ethics\".\n\nAristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function (\"ergon\") of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the \"psuchē\" (\"soul\") in accordance with reason (\"logos\"). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity (the virtuous mean, between the accompanying vices of excess or deficiency) of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, \"eudaimonia\", generally translated as \"happiness\" or sometimes \"well being\". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character (\"ēthikē\" \"aretē\"), often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence.\n\nAristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom (\"phronesis\") and their intellect (\"nous\") can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.\n\nIn addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled \"Politics\". Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, \"for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part\". He also famously stated that \"man is by nature a political animal\" and also arguing that humanity's defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality. Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.\n\nThe common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city (\"polis\") which functions as a political \"community\" or \"partnership\" (\"koinōnia\"). The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: \"The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together.\" This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with social contract theory, according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of \"fear of violent death\" or its \"inconveniences.\"\n\nIn \"Protrepticus\", the character 'Aristotle' states:\n\nAristotle made substantial contributions to economic thought, especially to thought in the Middle Ages. In \"Politics\", Aristotle addresses the city, property, and trade. His response to criticisms of private property, in Lionel Robbins's view, anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists, as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements. Aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society, and that although private property is often blamed for social strife, such evils in fact come from human nature. In \"Politics\", Aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money. Money came into use because people became dependent on one another, importing what they needed and exporting the surplus. For the sake of convenience, people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable, such as iron or silver.\n\nAristotle's discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the Middle Ages. He had a low opinion of retail, believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household, retail trade seeks to make a profit. It thus uses goods as a means to an end, rather than as an end unto itself. He believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural. Similarly, Aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural, as it makes a gain out of the money itself, and not from its use.\n\nAristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time. He wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth, the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement. Money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them \"commensurable\". He goes to on state that money is also useful for future exchange, making it a sort of security. That is, \"if we do not want a thing now, we shall be able to get it when we do want it\".\n\nAristotle's \"Rhetoric\" proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience: \"ethos\" (an appeal to the speaker's character), \"pathos\" (an appeal to the audience's emotion), and \"logos\" (an appeal to logical reasoning). He also categorises rhetoric into three genres: epideictic (ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame), forensic (judicial speeches over guilt or innocence), and deliberative (speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue). Aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proofs: \"enthymeme\" (proof by syllogism) and \"paradeigma\" (proof by example).\n\nAristotle writes in his \"Poetics\" that epic poetry, tragedy, comedy, dithyrambic poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and dance are all fundamentally acts of \"mimesis\" (\"imitation\"), each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. He applies the term \"mimesis\" both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artist's intention and contends that the audience's realisation of the \"mimesis\" is vital to understanding the work itself. Aristotle states that \"mimesis\" is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry \"follows the pattern of nature\". Because of this, Aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what Stephen Halliwell calls \"highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes.\" For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.\n\nWhile it is believed that Aristotle's \"Poetics\" originally comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes \"Poetics\" with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic. Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the Delphic Oracle and studied the fables of Aesop.\n\nAristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On this ground, proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused Aristotle of misogyny and sexism. However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his \"Rhetoric\" that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as men.\n\nMore than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher Bryan Magee, \"it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did\". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of formal logic, pioneered the study of zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method. Taneli Kukkonen, writing in \"The Classical Tradition\", observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched, and his reach in influencing \"every branch of intellectual enterprise\" including Western ethical and political theory, theology, rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long. As a result, Kukkonen argues, any analysis of reality today \"will almost certainly carry Aristotelian overtones ... evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind.\" Jonathan Barnes wrote that \"an account of Aristotle's intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of European thought\".\n\nAristotle's pupil and successor, Theophrastus, wrote the \"History of Plants\", a pioneering work in botany. Some of his technical terms remain in use, such as carpel from \"carpos\", fruit, and pericarp, from \"pericarpion\", seed chamber.\nTheophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than Aristotle was, instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned.\n\nThe immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the Peripatetic school. Aristotle's notable students included Aristoxenus, Dicaearchus, Demetrius of Phalerum, Eudemos of Rhodes, Harpalus, Hephaestion, Mnason of Phocis, Nicomachus, and Theophrastus. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained \"Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?\"\n\nAfter Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is not until the age of Alexandria under the Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found.\n\nThe first medical teacher at Alexandria, Herophilus of Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between veins and arteries, noting that the latter pulse while the former do not. Though a few ancient atomists such as Lucretius challenged the teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, natural theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. Ernst Mayr states that there was \"nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance.\"\n\nGreek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and Stephen of Alexandria in the early seventh century. John Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought. Philoponus questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics, noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations.\n\nAfter a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and Michael of Ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by Anna Comnena.\n\nAristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early Islamic theology. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle, as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars. Averroes, Avicenna and Alpharabius, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced Thomas Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. Alkindus considered Aristotle the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the \"exemplar\" for all future philosophers. Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the \"First Teacher\". The title \"teacher\" was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of Islamic philosophy.\n\nIn accordance with the Greek theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with Plato essential tenets of thought. Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.\n\nWith the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. AD 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the \"Organon\" made by Boethius. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by Gerard of Cremona, and from the original Greek, such as those by James of Venice and William of Moerbeke. After the Scholastic Thomas Aquinas wrote his \"Summa Theologica\", working from Moerbeke's translations and calling Aristotle \"The Philosopher\", the demand for Aristotle's writings grew, and the Greek manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the Renaissance. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. Scholars such as Boethius, Peter Abelard, and John Buridan worked on Aristotelian logic.\n\nThe medieval English poet Chaucer describes his student as being happy by having\n\n<poem>at his beddes heed\nTwenty bookes, clad in blak or reed,\nOf aristotle and his philosophie,</poem>\n\nA cautionary medieval tale held that Aristotle advised his pupil Alexander to avoid the king's seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her, and allowed her to ride him. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Artists such as Hans Baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme.\n\nThe Italian poet Dante says of Aristotle in \"The Divine Comedy\":\n\nIn the Early Modern period, scientists such as William Harvey in England and Galileo Galilei in Italy reacted against the theories of Aristotle and other classical era thinkers like Galen, establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment. Harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood, establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the body's heat, as Aristotle thought. Galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace Aristotle's physics, proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight.\n\nThe 19th-century German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle. Aristotle rigidly separated action from production, and argued for the deserved subservience of some people (\"natural slaves\"), and the natural superiority (virtue, \"arete\") of others. It was Martin Heidegger, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition.\n\nThe English mathematician George Boole fully accepted Aristotle's logic, but decided \"to go under, over, and beyond\" it with his system of algebraic logic in his 1854 book \"The Laws of Thought\". This gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations, enables it to solve equations as well as check validity, and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms, not just two.\n\nDuring the 20th century, Aristotle's work was widely criticised. The philosopher Bertrand Russell\nargued that \"almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine\". Russell called Aristotle's ethics \"repulsive\", and labelled his logic \"as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy\". Russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors. In 1985, the biologist Peter Medawar could still state in \"pure seventeenth century\" tones that Aristotle had assembled \"a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay, imperfect observation, wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility\".\n\nBy the start of the 21st century, however, Aristotle was taken more seriously: Kukkonen noted that \"In the best 20th-century scholarship Aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the Greek philosophical tradition.\" Ayn Rand accredited Aristotle as \"the greatest philosopher in history\" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. More recently, Alasdair MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans. Kukkonen observed, too, that \"that most enduring of romantic images, Aristotle tutoring the future conqueror Alexander\" remained current, as in the 2004 film \"Alexander\", while the \"firm rules\" of Aristotle's theory of drama have ensured a role for the \"Poetics\" in Hollywood.\n\nBiologists continue to be interested in Aristotle's thinking. Armand Marie Leroi has reconstructed Aristotle's biology, while Niko Tinbergen's four questions, based on Aristotle's four causes, are used to analyse animal behaviour; they examine function, phylogeny, mechanism, and ontogeny.\n\nThe works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organisation of Immanuel Bekker's Royal Prussian Academy edition (\"Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica\", Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.\n\nAristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls, the common writing medium of that era. His writings are divisible into two groups: the \"exoteric\", intended for the public, and the \"esoteric\", for use within the Lyceum school. Aristotle's \"lost\" works stray considerably in characterisation from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication, the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication. Cicero's description of Aristotle's literary style as \"a river of gold\" must have applied to the published works, not the surviving notes. A major question in the history of Aristotle's works is how the exoteric writings were all lost, and how the ones we now possess came to us. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.\n\nAristotle has been depicted by major artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder, Justus van Gent, Raphael, Paolo Veronese, Jusepe de Ribera, Rembrandt, and Francesco Hayez over the centuries. Among the best-known is Raphael's fresco \"The School of Athens\", in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace, where the figures of Plato and Aristotle are central to the image, at the architectural vanishing point, reflecting their importance. Rembrandt's \"Aristotle with a Bust of Homer\", too, is a celebrated work, showing the knowing philosopher and the blind Homer from an earlier age: as the art critic Jonathan Jones writes, \"this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world, ensnaring us in its musty, glowing, pitch-black, terrible knowledge of time.\"\n\nThe Aristotle Mountains in Antarctica are named after Aristotle. He was the first person known to conjecture, in his book \"Meteorology\", the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and called it \"Antarctica\". Aristoteles is a crater on the Moon bearing the classical form of Aristotle's name.\n\n\n\nThe secondary literature on Aristotle is vast. The following references are only a small selection.\n\n\n\n"}

It most resembles a case binding in that it has a hollow back and visible joint, but unlike a case binding, it is built up on the book. Characteristic of the binding is the material covering the outside boards is separate from the material covering the spine. Many bookbinders consider the Bradel binding to be stronger than a case binding.\n\nThe binding may be traced to 18th century Germany. The originator of the binding is uncertain, but the name comes from a French binder working in Germany, Alexis-Pierre Bradel (also known as \"Bradel l'ainé\" or \"Bradel-Derome\"). The binding originally appeared as a temporary binding, but the results were durable, and the binding had great success in the nineteenth century. Today, it is most likely to be encountered in photo albums and scrapbooks.\n\nThe binding has the advantage of allowing the book to open fully, where traditional leather bindings are too rigid. It is sometimes modified to provide a rounded spine. This lends the appearance of a book where the paper is not suited to spine rounding; this is also to provide a rounded spine to a book too thin for a spine rounding to hold. The binding may also provide an impressive-looking leather spine to a book without incurring the full expense of binding a book in full or partial leather.\n\n\n"}

The dictator is not absolute and the dictator's authority remains limited by the constitution.\n\nThe Roman Republic made provision for a dictator who could govern unchecked for a stipulated period of time. Unlike other magistrates, a dictator was not subject to review of his actions at the conclusion of his term.\n\nThe United States Constitution has a similar dictator clause stating that the President \"may adjourn [congress] to such Time as he shall think proper\" if the two houses disagree on when to adjourn.\nAbraham Lincoln, President of the United States during the American Civil War, exercised extraordinary powers to preserve the Union. Lincoln's dictatorial actions included directly ordering the arrest and detention of dissenters and the suspension of the right to writs of habeas corpus. However, Lincoln remained subject to Congressional oversight, judicial review, and periodic elections.\n\nThe Weimer Republic, which succeeded Imperial Germany after the First World War, adopted a constitutional provision that expressly enabled the president to rule by decree, without consultation with the legislative branch. That provision was used by Chancellor Hitler to consolidate his powers upon his selection by President Hindenburg.\n\nUS President Franklin D. Roosevelt also exercised extraordinary powers in response to the Great Depression and the Second World War.

The \"function\" side covers what is commonly understood as \"meaning\", \"content\", or \"intent\"; it usually extends over both conventional fields of semantics and pragmatics.\n\nLanguage users learn these pairings as individual, whole facts about language. These language facts are indexed to specific interactive contexts and/or linguistic practices. They may be associated in the mind of the language user with a highly particularized sociolect, dialect, pattern of jargon, genre, or register.\n\nThe guiding insight of construction grammar (often abbreviated CxG) is that rules of syntactic combination are directly associated with interpretive and use conditions. All construction-based grammars allow units bigger than the word as semantic building blocks of syntax. One example is the bipartite clausal pattern sometimes referred to as the Correlative Conditional construction, as found in the proverbial expression \"The bigger they come, the harder they fall\" ; another is the Copula Doubling construction exemplified by \"The thing is, is you never really know\" . In contrast to traditional compositional approaches to syntax, in which all conceptual content comes from the lexicon, and rules of syntactic combination do no more than determine which word sequences function as units for syntactic purposes, constructional approaches assume a continuum of idiomaticity (or generality) of expressions, from tightly bound idioms to fully productive patterns. This fundamental commitment unites all of the varieties of CxG, whether or not formal descriptive methods are used and whether the research program targets language development, second-language learning, typology, diachrony, language productions and comprehension, language evolution, conversational practice or social identity. Owing to its focus on descriptive precision, patterns of usage, grammaticalization and the structure of linguistic categories, CxG is closely linked to the explanatory frameworks of cognitive-functional linguistics.\n\nHistorically, the notion of construction grammar developed out of the ideas of \"global rules\" and \"transderivational rules\" in generative semantics, together with the generative semantic idea of a grammar as a constraint satisfaction system.\nGeorge Lakoff's \"Syntactic Amalgams\" paper in 1974 (Chicago Linguistics Society, 1974) posed a challenge for the idea of transformational derivation.\n\nConstruction grammar was spurred on by the development of Cognitive Semantics, beginning in 1975 and extending through the 1980s. Lakoff's 1977 paper, Linguistic Gestalts (Chicago Linguistic Society, 1977) was an early version of CxG, arguing that the meaning of the whole was not a compositional function of the meaning of the parts put together locally. Instead, he suggested, constructions themselves must have meanings.\n\nConstruction grammar was developed in the 1980s by linguists such as Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, and George Lakoff. Construction grammar was developed in order to handle cases that intrinsically went beyond the capacity of generative grammar.\n\nThe earliest study was \"There-Constructions,\" which appeared as Case Study 3 in George Lakoff's \"Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things\". It argued that the meaning of the whole was not a function of the meanings of the parts, that odd grammatical properties of Deictic There-constructions followed from the pragmatic meaning of the construction, and that variations on the central construction could be seen as simple extensions using form-meaning pairs of the central construction.\n\nFillmore et al.'s (1988) paper on the English \"let alone\" construction was a second classic. These two papers propelled cognitive linguists into the study of CxG.\n\nIn construction grammar, like in general semiotics, the grammatical construction is a pairing of form and content. The formal aspect of a construction is typically described as a syntactic template, but the form covers more than just syntax, as it also involves phonological aspects, such as prosody and intonation. The content covers semantic as well as pragmatic meaning.\n\nThe semantic meaning of a grammatical construction is made up of conceptual structures postulated in cognitive semantics: image-schemas, frames, conceptual metaphors, conceptual metonymies, prototypes of various kinds, mental spaces, and bindings across these (called \"blends\"). Pragmatics just becomes the cognitive semantics of communication—the modern version of the old Ross-Lakoff performative hypothesis from the 1960s.\n\nThe form and content are symbolically linked in the sense advocated by Langacker.\n\nThus a construction is treated like a sign in which all structural aspects are integrated parts and not distributed over different modules as they are in the componential model. Consequentially, not only constructions that are lexically fixed, like many idioms, but also more abstract ones like argument structure schemata, are pairings of form and conventionalized meaning. For instance, the ditransitive schema [S V IO DO] is said to express semantic content X CAUSES Y TO RECEIVE Z, just like \"kill\" means X CAUSES Y TO DIE.\n\nIn construction grammar, a grammatical construction, regardless of its formal or semantic complexity and make up, is a pairing of form and meaning. Thus words and word classes may be regarded as instances of constructions. Indeed, construction grammarians argue that all pairings of form and meaning are constructions, including phrase structures, idioms, words and even morphemes.\n\nUnlike the componential model, construction grammar denies any strict distinction between the two and proposes a \"syntax-lexicon continuum\". The argument goes that words and complex constructions are both pairs of form and meaning and differ only in internal symbolic complexity. Instead of being discrete modules and thus subject to very different processes they form the extremes of a continuum (from regular to idiosyncratic): syntax > subcategorization frame > idiom > morphology > syntactic category > word/lexicon (these are the traditional terms; construction grammars use a different terminology).\n\nIn construction grammar, the grammar of a language is made up of taxonomic networks of families of constructions, which are based on the same principles as those of the conceptual categories known from cognitive linguistics, such as inheritance, prototypicality, extensions, and multiple parenting.\n\nFour different models are proposed in relation to how information is stored in the taxonomies:\n\n\nAll four models are advocated by different construction grammarians, but since the late 1990s there has been a shift towards a general preference for the usage-based model. The shift towards the usage-based approach in construction grammar has inspired the development of several corpus-based methodologies of constructional analysis (for example, collostructional analysis).\n\nAs construction grammar is based on schemas and taxonomies, it does not operate with dynamic rules of derivation. Rather, it is monotonic.\n\nBecause construction grammar does not operate with surface derivations from underlying structures, it adheres to functionalist linguist Dwight Bolinger's \"principle of no synonymy\", on which Adele Goldberg elaborates in her book.\n\nThis means that construction grammarians argue, for instance, that active and passive versions of the same proposition are not derived from an underlying structure, but are instances of two different constructions. As constructions are pairings of form and meaning, active and passive versions of the same proposition are not synonymous, but display differences in content: in this case the pragmatic content.\n\nAs mentioned above, Construction grammar is a \"family\" of theories rather than one unified theory. There are a number of formalized Construction grammar frameworks. Some of these are:\n\nBerkeley Construction Grammar (BCG: formerly also simply called Construction Grammar in upper case) focuses on the formal aspects of constructions and makes use of a unification-based framework for description of syntax, not unlike head-driven phrase structure grammar. Its proponents/developers include Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Laura Michaelis, and to a certain extent Ivan Sag. Immanent within BCG works like Fillmore and Kay 1995 and Michaelis and Ruppenhofer 2001 is the notion that phrasal representations—embedding relations—should not be used to represent combinatoric properties of lexemes or lexeme classes. For example, BCG abandons the traditional practice of using non-branching domination (NP over N' over N) to describe undetermined nominals that function as NPs, instead introducing a determination construction that requires ('asks for') a non-maximal nominal sister and a lexical 'maximality' feature for which plural and mass nouns are unmarked. BCG also offers a unification-based representation of 'argument structure' patterns as abstract verbal lexeme entries ('linking constructions'). These linking constructions include transitive, oblique goal and passive constructions. These constructions describe classes of verbs that combine with phrasal constructions like the VP construction but contain no phrasal information in themselves.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, several of the developers of BCG, including Charles Fillmore, Paul Kay, Ivan Sag and Laura Michaelis, collaborated in an effort to improve the formal rigor of BCG and clarify its representational conventions. The result was Sign Based Construction Grammar (SBCG). SBCG is based on a multiple-inheritance hierarchy of typed feature structures. The most important type of feature structure in SBCG is the sign, with subtypes word, lexeme and phrase. The inclusion of phrase within the canon of signs marks a major departure from traditional syntactic thinking. In SBCG, phrasal signs are licensed by correspondence to the mother of some licit construct of the grammar. A construct is a local tree with signs at its nodes. Combinatorial constructions define classes of constructs. Lexical class constructions describe combinatoric and other properties common to a group of lexemes. Combinatorial constructions include both inflectional and derivational constructions. SBCG is both formal and generative; while cognitive-functional grammarians have often opposed their standards and practices to those of formal, generative grammarians, there is in fact no incompatibility between a formal, generative approach and a rich, broad-coverage, functionally based grammar. It simply happens that many formal, generative theories are descriptively inadequate grammars. SBCG is generative in a way that prevailing syntax-centered theories are not: its mechanisms are intended to represent all of the patterns of a given language, including idiomatic ones; there is no 'core' grammar in SBCG. SBCG a licensing-based theory, as opposed to one that freely generates syntactic combinations and uses general principles to bar illicit ones: a word, lexeme or phrase is well formed if and only if it is described by a lexeme or construction. Recent SBCG works have expanded on the lexicalist model of idiomatically combining expressions sketched out in Sag 2012.\n\nThe type of construction grammar associated with linguists like Goldberg and Lakoff looks mainly at the external relations of constructions and the structure of constructional networks. In terms of form and function, this type of construction grammar puts psychological plausibility as its highest desideratum. It emphasizes experimental results and parallels with general cognitive psychology. It also draws on certain principles of cognitive linguistics. In the Goldbergian strand, constructions interact with each other in a network via four inheritance relations: polysemy link, subpart link, metaphorical extension, and finally instance link.\n\nSometimes, Ronald Langacker's cognitive grammar framework is described as a type of construction grammar. Cognitive grammar deals mainly with the semantic content of constructions, and its central argument is that conceptual semantics is primary to the degree that form mirrors, or is motivated by, content. Langacker argues that even abstract grammatical units like part-of-speech classes are semantically motivated and involve certain conceptualizations.\n\nWilliam A. Croft's radical construction grammar is designed for typological purposes and takes into account cross-linguistic factors. It deals mainly with the internal structure of constructions. Radical construction grammar is totally non-reductionist, and Croft argues that constructions are not derived from their parts, but that the parts are derived from the constructions they appear in. Thus, in radical construction grammar, constructions are likened to Gestalts. Radical construction grammar rejects the idea that syntactic categories, roles, and relations are universal and argues that they are not only language-specific, but also construction specific. Thus, there are no universals that make reference to formal categories, since formal categories are language- and construction-specific. The only universals are to be found in the patterns concerning the mapping of meaning onto form. Radical construction grammar rejects the notion of syntactic relations altogether and replaces them with semantic relations. Like Goldbergian/Lakovian construction grammar and cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar is closely related to cognitive linguistics, and like cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar appears to be based on the idea that form is semantically motivated.\n\nEmbodied construction grammar (ECG), which is being developed by the Neural Theory of Language (NTL) group at ICSI, UC Berkeley, and the University of Hawaii, particularly including Benjamin Bergen and Nancy Chang, adopts the basic constructionist definition of a grammatical construction, but emphasizes the relation of constructional semantic content to embodiment and sensorimotor experiences. A central claim is that the content of all linguistic signs involves mental simulations and is ultimately dependent on basic image schemas of the kind advocated by Mark Johnson and George Lakoff, and so ECG aligns itself with cognitive linguistics. Like construction grammar, embodied construction grammar makes use of a unification-based model of representation. A non-technical introduction to the NTL theory behind embodied construction grammar as well as the theory itself and a variety of applications can be found in Jerome Feldman's \"From Molecule to Metaphor: A Neural Theory of Language\" (MIT Press, 2006).\n\nFluid construction grammar (FCG) was designed by Luc Steels and his collaborators for doing experiments on the origins and evolution of language. FCG is a fully operational and computationally implemented formalism for construction grammars and proposes a uniform mechanism for parsing and production. Moreover, it has been demonstrated through robotic experiments that FCG grammars can be grounded in embodiment and sensorimotor experiences. FCG integrates many notions from contemporary computational linguistics such as feature structures and unification-based language processing. Constructions are considered bidirectional and hence usable both for parsing and production. Processing is flexible in the sense that it can even cope with partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences. FCG is called 'fluid' because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars. The research on FCG is conducted at Sony CSL Paris and the AI Lab at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.\n\nIn addition there are several construction grammarians who operate within the general framework of construction grammar without affiliating themselves with any specific construction grammar program. There is a growing interest in the diachronic aspect of grammatical constructions and thus in the importation of methods and ideas from grammaticalization studies. Another area of growing interest is the pragmatics of pragmatic constructions. This is probably one of the reasons why the usage-based model is gaining popularity among construction grammarians. Another area of increasing interest among construction grammarians is that of language acquisition which is mainly due to Michael Tomasello's work. Mats Andrén coined the term multimodal constructions to account for constructions that incorporate both (conventionalized) gesture and speech.\n\n\n\n"}

The term 'contemplative psychology' therefore does not refer to academic psychological theory about contemplation, religion or religious behavior. It refers to the psychological insights and methods that are - often implicitly - present in the vision and practice of religions and that clarify and guide ones contemplative or religious development\" (p. 82). \"Contemplative psychology addresses the question of how we could intelligently approach and understand human life-experience\" (p. 83).\n\nThe term Contemplative Psychology was coined by Han F. De Wit in 1991 when he, a theoretical psychologist at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, published his pioneering book \"Contemplative Psychology.\" The goal of this project was to \"establish a dialogue between contemplative psychology and academic psychology\" (p. 233). As a first step Han did not offer a systematic contemplative psychology but rather he suggested a \"framework in which a full-fledged contemplative psychology may be developed\" (p. 3). Is this work he outlines the \"contours and the view of contemplative psychology\" (p. 4). As Han develops the concept, his first point is to illustrate \"a position from which the 'excavation' and 'exposure' of the contemplative psychologies seems possible\" (p. 115) and to \"make explicit and clarify the nature and position of the psychological \"know-how\" that contemplative traditions contain\" (p. 14) This implied a comparative study of different religious and contemplative traditions in the belief that there was enough in common between these traditions to make \"the search for a general contemplative psychological perspective and approach\" meaningful (p. 4).\n\nContemplative psychology became visible in the Western sphere of psychology when researchers began studying the methods used to help individuals understand their own mind, emotions, and motivations. The goal of these practices is to improve the quality of one's own life (and, by extension, the quality of other people's lives). Research began at Naropa University, and was developed extensively by Han himself.\n\nThus far, mindfulness has been the contemplative practice of most research. Mindfulness is a practice that allows one to exist in the present moment without being judgmental of it. This meditative absorption, often referred to as samadhi in many eastern traditions, is the equivalent of contemplation in Western traditions. Gerald G. May expands on this notion in his book \"Will and Spirit\" by differentiating between willfulness and willingness. \"Willfulness\", he explains, is one's attempted mastery over the psyche, while \"willingness\" is a surrender of one's self to a way of being. Contemplative practices allow persons to cultivate meaningful experiences intrinsic to religious and spiritual traditions that are virtually absent in modern, mechanistic psychology alone.\n\nFor Han, the project of defining a contemplative psychology begins with the excavation and explication of the \"psychology embedded in various contemplative traditions (although often in an implicit and not fully developed state); to compare these different psychologies and derive more general rules from them; and to refine and systematize these findings further through a confrontation with contemporary academic psychology\" (p. 84). Thus Han did not create the concept of contemplative psychology from scratch. It emerged as a common \"techne\" in various religious and secular traditions.\n\nHan develops three concepts of contemplative tradition: monastic tradition, lay tradition and temporal (non-religious) tradition. Monastic tradition is \"a context in which people devote their whole life to the practice of a religious discipline and to the spiritual exercises that are part of it\" (p. 84). People of the monastic traditions typically live with a group of individuals that is fairly separate from the surrounding society. \"Their daily life activities are permeated by a discipline that is supposed to develop and sustain religious or spiritual growth\" (p. 84). These individuals are typically trained to possess a practical knowledge of their particular tradition and there role is to educate people in the religious view of the world. \"This know how is psychological and methodological in nature\" (p. 84). It is a form of contemplative psychology.\n\nLay traditions are \"religious disciplines that are practiced in the context of normal every day life\" (p. 84). There are two particular views on lay tradition practice. One is that religious practice in everyday life brings one closer to a monastic tradition and the other is that daily life is the ultimate monastery and that daily practice is the monastic practice brought into everyday lived experiences. In either view there is psychological knowledge that could be considered contemplative.\n\nTemporal (non-religious) traditions are \"contemplative traditions could be 'non religious', that is without a connection with a particular religion\" (p. 84). Despite an informal nature these traditions contain \"a discipline based on a particular kind of psychological knowledge, that guides its practitioners towards the realization of the highest human values\" (p. 84).\n\nThe assumption of contemplative psychology is that contemplative traditions have in common \"some normative anthropology, some notion of 'materialistic man' or 'fallen man' and the idea that human beings have the possibility to uplift themselves and others from their' corrupted state' towards what is often called 'enlightenment'\"(p. 84). Contemplative psychology gathers its knowledge base from the comparative analysis of experiential knowledge across contemplative traditions.\n\n\"If we would interpret the preposition ‘of’ in the possessive sense of 'belonging to', then contemplative psychology would definitely be a psychology of religion, but the academic ‘psychology of religion’ would not. For the standard interpretation of the preposition ‘of' in ‘psychology of religion’ is rather in the direction of ‘about’ than in the direction of ‘belonging to’. And conventional psychology about religion is not and does not intend to be a psychology belonging to religion\" (p.86).Thus contemplative psychology is a psychology of first-person experience. The psychology of religion (and scientific psychology) is a psychology \"about\" its object of study, it is a third-person psychology. The major difference is epistemological. The first-person nature of contemplative psychology values the knowledge which comes from private, personal experience. \"It has its own notion of objectivity (see e.g. the ‘acid test of truth’ in Roberts, 1985: 171)\" (p.86). The psychology of religion and scientific psychology in general \"tend to shun away from research into experience that is only available in the first-person sense. For the private character of first-person experience seems to exclude ‘objectivity’ as defined in third person methodology\" (p. 86).\n\n\"The object of contemplative psychology is the totality of human existence or human experience. The central question is: what is the place of all aspects of human life within the contemplative perspective and its development? How could one deal with all these aspects in a way that furthers one’s contemplative development\" (p.87)?\"The object of scientific psychology of religion is religion itself, which is viewed as one among the many non-religious aspects of human life. The central question here is: how could we gain a third-person psychological understanding of religious phenomena and how are these causally related to other non-religious phenomena\" (p.87)?\n\nThe aim of contemplative psychology as a field of study is a way of life. It pursues knowledge about living \"in the first-person sense of being wise [and] being free from confusion and ignorance\" (p. 87).\n\nThe aim of psychology of religion is scientific knowledge, that is true information \"about\" its object of study. \"This knowledge is primarily representational and indirect and as such distinct from (at a distance of) what it represents\"(p. 87).\n\nBecause of the difference in epistemological bases there is also differentiation between the methods of acquiring the differing types of knowledge. The methods of contemplative psychologies are in fact practices and disciplines like (meditation, contemplation, prayer) that bring about what the contemplative tradition views the existentential path towards the above-mentioned aims.\" Han de Wit characterizes these practices as \"awareness strategies\" that are aimed at the \"discipline of becoming aware on the spot of one’s working basis\" (p. 111). The methods of psychology of religion consist of the empirical scientific method, which are characterized by Han de Wit as \"conceptual strategies,\" as they aim for the development of conceptual knowledge that represents human behavior.\"\n\nAn example of using contemplative psychology would be using Buddhist concepts such as brilliant sanity (or buddha-nature), ego, mindfulness, and interconnectedness as framework for interpreting psychological experiences, as is done in the contemplative counseling program at Naropa university. The same could be applied to other faiths, as May used the Christian concept of Grace as a framework for explaining our psychological surrender to a cosmic order.\n\nRoberts, B. \"The path to no self\".

{"id": "29200595", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29200595", "title": "Encyclopedia of Performing Arts", "text": "Encyclopedia of Performing Arts\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Performing Arts (Italian: Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo; sometimes cited as Enciclopedio dello Spettacolo) was an Italian language specialty encyclopedia of performing arts, published between 1954 and 1965. Its first editor was the Italian theatre critic and journalist, Silvio D'Amico. Considered to be the most comprehensive international performing arts encyclopedia, it is included in the reference section of many libraries.\n\nThe Encyclopedia of Performing Arts was created by two separate projects, one dating to 1945 and the other to 1954.\n\nStarting in 1945 or 1946, D'Amico conceived of a project to develop an encyclopedia of the performing arts. Undertaken by an editorial team composed of a few people and led by D'Amico, it was produced in three or four years and contained four volumes. Considered superficial, it was not publishable. However, it developed a model for scientific study of the theater and other performing arts.\n\nConceived as a set of 12 volumes, the second project took on an ethnographic approach. It had the advantage of a stable editorial group and used foreign employees. D'Amico's editorial staff worked at the Palazzo Doria Pamphili, Via del Plebiscito 112. The attorney Carlo Minù, D'Amico's brother-in-law, found funding for the second project and referred D'Amico to publishers. In drawing up lists of dramas, operas, ballets and films, the editorial team wondered if it their work was worthwhile or helpful. It was Francesco Savio who sometimes said, \"Of course it is; if someone else wants one day to create an Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, they would find this materials to be useful.\" When the news spread that the encyclopedia was about to be published, a delegation arrived wanting guidance in the organizational work to start up an encyclopedia of Prague theater.\n\nThe structure of the work was better articulated. Responsibility for each section, such as film, music, or theater, was delegated to an initial small staff that rapidly grew to thirty editors that coordinated over five hundred employees. Large blocks of work were assigned to collaborators, many of them in foreign countries.\n\nD'Amico felt that the second project benefited from finding amateur collectors without whose assistance entire sectors of biographical entries would have been less detailed. Collected material came from abroad or was bought directly in the antique market. An example of a collector was Ulderico Rolandi, a gynecologist who lived in the Via Veneto, and who had made a hobby of collecting, filing and examining librettos. He had accumulated what was thought to be the largest collection of opera librettos after the Library of Congress. Another example was David Turcotte who had developed a catalog of American cinema.\n\nThe project suffered a severe crisis in 1957, two years after the death of D'Amico, due to disagreements between the editorial office and the publisher. The publisher's expectation was to publish two volumes a year, but the editorial staff was only able to put out a single volume each year. Because of this crisis, there is an imbalance between the first volume and the last four whose detail is considered sometimes less accurate.\n\nPublished between 1954 and 1962, the original nine volume \"Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo\" covers ballet, films, opera, plays, theater, vaudeville, and other areas of entertainment. They include signed essays that discuss performers, directors, and writers. Other sections discuss genres and themes, as well as history, technical subjects, and bibliographies. The encyclopedia is over 18,000 pages in length and profusely illustrated with thousands of illustrations of which 700 are in the text, 1800 are out of the text, and there are 320 color plates. The first print run of 10,000 copies was followed by a reprint of 5,000 additional copies. Originally published in Rome by Casa Editrice Le Maschere, reprints were published by UNEDI.\n\nPublished in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1966, the \"Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Aggiornamento 1955-1965\" (\"Encyclopedia of Performing Arts, Supplementary 1955-1965) is an update of the main set. The Aggiornamento addresses developments and biographies.\n\nPublished in Rome by Unione Editoriale in 1968, the \"Enciclopedia dello spettacolo. Indice-repertorio\" (Encyclopedia of Performing Arts. Index-Directory) is a title index of the 145,000 entries cited in the main set and the supplements. It addresses author, genre and year of composition.\n\nD'Amico conceived of the project and brought it to fruition. The theater section was under the direction of Luigi Squarzina; he also did the film section. D'Amico's father worked on the drama theatre section, while his brother Mario worked on the music section. Gabriele Baldini and later Gian Luigi Rondi were responsible for the cinema section. Additional sections were led by others including: classical antiquity by Bruno Gentili, German theater by Paolo Chiarini, Slavic theater by Angelo Maria Ripellino, English theater by Brunacci, French theater by Gian Carlo Roscioni, Iberian theater by Luciana Stegagno Picchio, and Italian theater by Niccolò Gallo, Giulio Cesare Castello, and Caesar Garboli. The Chamber music section was under the direction of D'Amico's son, Fedele D'Amico, a musicologist, with Nino Pirrotta, Franco Serpa and Emilia Zanetti as editors.\n\nConsultants included Sabatino Moscati for Hebrew and Yiddish theater; Dario Puccini for the Iberian language theater; Luigi Salvini for Slavic, Finno-Ugric and Romanian language theater; Giuliano Bertuccioli for Chinese language theater. Almost all of the drawings were made by young, recent graduates. Some of the illustrations were edited by Helen Poveledo. Texts and drafts were reviewed by professors.\n\nMost libraries found it to be an essential component of their reference section.\n\nThe proposed biographies of many lesser figures were not included as the editorial staff were unable to keep up with the publisher's deadline.\n\nCriticisms of the encyclopedia have included the fact that it was only available in the Italian language, that it was Eurocentric, and that non-European theater and 20th century theater were underrepresented. While the encyclopedia was first published in the 1950s, it was based on pre-World War II documentation. By the 1970s, the \"Encyclopedia of Performing Arts\" was considered out of date.\n"}

It has become a national event focused on the emotion and character of automotive design.\n\nThe Eyes on Design Show was established on the late-1986 as both celebration of automotive design and a fundraiser for the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, a nonprofit organization in Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan, devoted to matters pertaining to the eye and vision.\n\nThe first shows were called \"Eyes On The Classics\". The first shows were held in the Grosse Pointe Academy parking lots. Initially focused on the domestic \"Big Three\" (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler), the show was expanded to include automakers from around the world. The name was also changed to \"EyesOn Design\". For its third show, the venue moved to the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House.\n\nTo ease access and accommodate the increasing public attendance, the design chiefs at DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and General Motors suggested that the event be hosted by one of their companies each year. The 2002 show was held at the Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The theme for this 15th anniversary weekend-long show was \"Performance Vehicles\".\n\nIn 2003, the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan hosted the event. According to General Motors, the 2003 event was the largest, most complete collection of concept vehicles ever assembled representing the very best efforts of GM, Ford, Chrysler, and other automakers. The three-day event was also the first time the GM Design Center was open to the general public. Attendees also had the opportunity to purchase rides in notable GM concept cars.\n\nA Founding Chairman of the annual EyesOn Design event, Chuck Jordan, was commemorated during the January 2011 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The EyesOn Design show celebrated its 25th anniversary during summer 2012, on the grounds of the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House with over 200 vehicles displayed by invitation only.\n\nThe \"Eyes on Design Show\" has grown from an East Side show to an automobile exhibition of national and international significance.\n\nAccording to the Ford Motor Company, the Eyes on Design Show is the world's only car show to focus on the emotion and character of automotive design.\n\nBringing together some 250 concept cars in one place is the secret of the show's success that has been driven by the enthusiastic assistance of automotive design executives. In addition to vehicles from various automakers, the event also features concept cars by invitation from some of the world's most renowned vintage automobile collectors and restorers.\n\nThe vehicles shown at the annual event are by invitation. Judging in numerous classes is \"based not on the quality of the restoration or authenticity\"; rather it is on the basis of their \"the design character, emotional appeal and artistic excellence of the vehicle.\"\n\nThe EyesOn Design celebrations include the prestigious \"Lifetime Design Achievement\" award. This recognition is given to an accomplished automotive designer selected by previous winners of this award.\n"}

(shortened to Garmin, stylized as GARMIN, and formerly known as ProNav) is an American multinational technology company founded by Gary Burrell and Min Kao in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas, United States, with headquarters located in Olathe, Kansas. Since 2010, the company is incorporated in Schaffhausen, Switzerland.\n\nThe company specializes in GPS technology for automotive, aviation, marine, outdoor, and sport activities. Due to their development in wearable technology, they have also been competing with activity tracker and smartwatch consumer developers such as Fitbit and Apple.\n\nIn 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio. They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas, as \"ProNav\". ProNav's first product was a GPS unit which sold for . The company was later renamed \"Garmin\", a portmanteau of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao. In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer.\n\nBy 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $105 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. By 1999, sales had reached $233 million and a profit of $64 million. Garmin reported a 2006 total revenue of $1.77 billion, up 73% from $1.03 billion in 2005.\n\nBy 2000 Garmin had sold three million GPS devices, and was producing 50 different models. Its products were sold in 100 countries and carried by 2,500 independent distributors. As of 22 August 2000, the company held 35 patents on GPS technology. By the end of June 2000, the company employed 1,205 people: 541 in the United States, 635 in Taiwan, and 29 in the United Kingdom. In April 2018, Garmin launched Connect IQ 3.0  along with new apps - MySwim Pro, Yelp, Trailforks and iHeartRadio. In May 2018, Garmin partnered with the University of Kansas Medical Center to tackle sleep apnea and atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe company began public trading on NASDAQ on 8 December 2000. At that time Burrell owned 19,911,155 shares. Kao owned 20,352,803 shares. Together their holdings accounted for 45 percent of the company's stock. Kao's brother, Ruey-Jeng Kao, an attorney in Taipei, owned another 7,984,109 shares, which when combined with Burrell's and Kao's shares constituted 54.22 percent of the shares outstanding.\n\nIn August 2003, Garmin completed acquisition of UPS Aviation Technologies, Inc. based in Salem, Oregon, a subsidiary of United Parcel Service, Inc., expanding its product line of panel-mounted GPS/NAV/COMM units and integrated cockpit systems for private and commercial aircraft. The acquired company changed its name to Garmin AT, Inc. and continued operations as a wholly owned subsidiary of Garmin International, Inc.\n\nGarmin has acquired Dynastream Innovations, EME Tec Sat SAS (EME), and Digital Cyclone. Dynastream, in Cochrane, Alberta, produces personal monitoring technology (ANT+)—such as foot pods and heart rate monitors for sports and fitness products—and also ultra-low-power and low-cost wireless connectivity devices for a wide range of applications (ANT). EME Tec Sat SAS (EME) is the distributor of Garmin's consumer products in France; following the acquisition, EME changed its name to Garmin France SAS. Digital Cyclone Inc (DCI), located in Chanhassen, Minnesota, provides mobile weather solutions for consumers, pilots, and outdoor enthusiasts. Garmin also bought Nautamatic Marine Systems, an Oregon-based company that makes autopilot systems for boats. In July 2011, Garmin finished its acquisition of the German satellite navigation company Navigon.\n\nIn 2006, Garmin introduced a new corporate logo, and opened its first retail store, located on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.\n\nIn 2015, Garmin acquired South Africa's iKubu Ltd. for its Backtracker on-bicycle low power radar system.\n\nIn 2018, it was reported that the Garmin subsidiary Navionics had exposed hundreds of thousands of customer records, when its MongoDB database wasn't secured with a password.\n\nBurrell retired in 2003 as Garmin's chief executive officer and in 2004 retired as chairman of its board of directors. He is now chairman emeritus. Kao became CEO in 2003, and chairman in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, \"Forbes\" estimated Kao’s net worth at $1.5 billion. He has donated $17.5 million to the University of Tennessee. The same year \"Forbes\" estimated Burrell’s net worth as $940 million. Cliff Pemble is the current CEO of Garmin.\n\nGarmin operates in several other countries besides the UK, USA, and Taiwan. It operates as Formar (Belgium), Garmin AMB (Canada), Belanor (Norway), Trepat (Spain), and Garmin-Cluj (Romania).\n\nThe company’s first product was the GPS 100, a panel-mounted GPS receiver aimed at the marine market, priced at $2,500. It made its debut at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition in Chicago.\n\nAnother early product, a handheld GPS receiver, was sold to military personnel serving in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nIn the early 2000s (decade), Garmin launched a series of personal GPS devices aimed at recreational runners called the Forerunner. The Garmin Foretrex is a similar wrist-worn GPS device with two-dimensional GPS tracking and waypoint projection called .\n\nThe compact eTrex was introduced in 2000; several models with different features have been released since. The original eTrex, commonly nicknamed \"eTrex Yellow\", offered a lightweight (5.3 oz/150 g), waterproof, palm-sized 12-channel GPS receiver, along with a battery life of up to 22 hours on two AA-size batteries. It was replaced in 2007 by the eTrex H, which added a high-sensitivity receiver. Other eTrex models include the Summit, Venture, Legend, and Vista, each with various additional features such as WAAS, altimeter, digital compass, city database, and highway maps. Many of these models come in color and expandable-memory versions.\n\nIn May 2011 Garmin refreshed the eTrex product line with new mechanical design and support for advances in cartography and hardware technology with its release of the eTrex 10, eTrex 20, and eTrex 30, Garmin became the first company to manufacture and distribute a worldwide consumer navigation product supporting both GPS and GLONASS satellite constellations. On May 13, 2015 Garmin released the eTrex 20x and 30x, which succeeded the eTrex 20 and 30. The main upgrade was a higher resolution screen and 4GB storage, double of the previous models.\n\nOn July 2, 2015 Garmin introduced its eTrex Touch line, releasing three models (25, 35 and 35t), all featuring a 2.6\" touch screen. The 35t model designation is not used in Europe, but the European market 35 is essentially the 35t, and both the European 25 and 35 include Garmin TopoActive Europe maps and 8GB of internal storage.\nThe Geko series was a compact line of handheld GPS receivers aimed at the budget or lightweight hiking market.\n\nIn 2004, Garmin introduced its \"60C\" line of handheld GPS mapping receivers, featuring increased sensitivity and storage capacity along with a battery life of up to 30 hours in battery-save mode. This was followed by the \"60Cx\" and \"60CSx\" with improved color map displays.\n\nWith the GTM-11, GTM 20 and GTM 25, a Garmin GPS device receives and uses traffic message channel (TMC) information. Also, some Garmin nüvi (1690, 1490T, 1450T, 1390T, 1390, 1350, 1260, 1250 and 265WT, 265T, 265W, 265, 255w and 255) comes with an integrated TMC receiver.\n\nIn 2003, Garmin launched the iQue line of integrated PDA-GPS receivers. On 31 October 2005, the iQue M4 became the first PDA that did not require a PC to preload the maps. The American version came with built-in maps of North America, while the UK version was supplied pre-loaded with maps of Western Europe.\n\nOn June 2, 2011, Garmin introduced Astro 320.\n\nOn June 12, 2014, Garmin introduced T5 and TT15 Collars for Astro and Alpha.\n\nOn July 31, 2015, T5 mini and T15 mini collars were added.\n\nOn June 16, 2016, Garmin introduced the Astro 430.\n\nOn October 10, 2016, Garmin added pairing of the Astro 430 and Alpha 100 to Garmin Smart Watches.\n\nGarmin also manufactures a line of sonar fishfinders, including some units that also have GPS capability.\n\nIn April 2008, Garmin launched Garmin Mobile PC, a GPS navigation software program for laptop PCs and other computers, based on the Microsoft Windows operating system, now discontinued.\n\nGarmin offers mobile apps for various purposes for Android, Windows Phone, and for iPhone.\n\nIn early 2009, Garmin announced it would be manufacturing a location-specific cellular telephone in cooperation with Asus. Called the \"Garmin-Asus nüvifone G60\", the United States release on AT&T was scheduled for October 4, 2009. Four other models in this line have since been released: two Windows Mobile-powered models for the European and Asian market, and two Android models, one for the Europe/Asia market and another for T-Mobile USA.\n\nThe \"Garmin Edge\" and certain models of \"Garmin Forerunner\" are a suite of GPS-enabled devices for use while running or cycling.\n\nGarmin offers integrated cockpits, panel mount displays, multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar and other avionics. \nGarmin entered this market in 1991 with the \"GPS-100AVD\" panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the \"GPS-95\", was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the \"GPS-155\" panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches. In 1998, Garmin introduced the \"GNS-430\", an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver. in 1998 rolled out its first integrated GPS, COM, VOR, LOC and glideslope product, the GNS 430. More than 125,000 GNS navigators are now installed in aircraft. Garmin reached its one millionth delivery in November 2017.\n\nThe G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft, the similar G950 is used in experimental aircraft, and the G600 is a retrofit.\n\nIn 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business.\n\nII Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches. The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation. This primary GPS \"sole source\" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80. The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV \"glidescope\" approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment. Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin.\n\nIn 1999: \"Flight International\" magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety.\n\nGarmin produces activity trackers and sports watches, aimed at activities such as running, watersports, golf, cycling and swimming with sensors such as heart rate and gps. Some recent models add Bluetooth music playback and puls-oximetry.\n\nThe vivofit and vivosmart ranges are activity trackers. The Garmin Vivofit 3 measures the wearer's duration and quality of sleep, quantifies body movement, records heart rate, counts steps and the number of stairs climbed. Garmin produces the Vivosmart HR. It comes with the touch screen and includes heart rate monitoring, media player controls, smart notifications and phone finder features.\n\nThe Forerunner series is aimed at running primarily, but the watches are more breadly focussed, especially in the higher end. The 735 XT has multi-sport tracking capabilities (automatically switching betweek sports, for example in a triathlon) and a variety of special profiles for jogging, swimming, cycling, skiing, paddle sports, a variety of weight loss activities, and hiking. It comes with built-in heart rate sensor and GPS.\n\nThe Fenix range, such as the Fenix 5 announced in 2017, is a more rugged, multisport range.\n\nThe Vivomove is a traditionally-styled watch with activity tracking capabilities. It has a built-in accelerometer (calculates distance during indoor workouts, without the need for a foot pod), step counter, auto goal (learns the wearer's activity level and assigns a daily step goal), move bar, and sleep-monitoring capabilities.\n\nOther series include the Quatix aimed at water sports, the D2 aviator watches, the Approach golf watches.\n\nIn 2018, Garmin introduced functionality such as maps, Bluetooth music playback, NFC payment and pulse-oximetry for it's wristwear.\n\nIn October 2018, Garmin announced it has integrated Spotify to its Garmin Fenux 5 Plus and Garmin Forerunner 645 Music GPS sports watch. Garmin was the second smartwatch maker to do so, after Spotify was exclusive to Samsung smartwatches since 2016 \n\nMost current Garmin devices can display its current location on a map, which is vector-based and stored in the built-in memory or loaded from additional flash media. The built-in (or 'basemap') displays all country borders and major cities. Garmin offers different maps for purchase, including detailed road maps, topographic maps and nautical maps. Non-commercial maps are also available and can be displayed on most Garmin GPS devices.\n\nThe maps used by Garmin products are currently provided by Navteq. Map errors are handled using Navteq Map Reporter. Errors can be reported using Garmin's report a map error page, or by using the Navteq map reporter.\n\nIn 2007 Garmin began sponsorship of English Premier League football club Middlesbrough in a one-year deal that was carried into a second year for the 2008/09 season. In 2008 Garmin began sponsorship of cycling team to promote its \"Edge\" line of bicycle computers. In 2015, the team became Cannondale-Garmin.\nIn 2014 Garmin paired up with Premier League side Southampton FC in a global partnership. Garmin's European head office is located in Southampton.\n\n\n"}

The network was initiated by COST Action BM0803 in January 2009. Currently HLA-NET activities are being coordinated by a subcommittee of the scientific committee of the European Federation for Immunogenetics.\n\nHLA-NET defined guidelines for the description of HLA typings concerning both the characterisation of the sample (including anthropological information) and the reporting of the typing data (including technical details to avoid misuse in the future). The guidelines also include rules for the validation of samples and suggests minimal requirements for data analysis. The HLA-NET portal provides an interface to software implementing these guidelines.\n\nHLA-NET main recommendations for population characterization have been published. Most notably, outdated racial/ethnical and meaningless terms have to be replaced by an acceptable terminology to describe populations (i.e. geographical and cultural criteria). \nAn electronic population questionnaire for field studies is available on the HLA-NET portal.\n\nHLA-NET defined standards for producing high quality data for HLA genotyping and proposed guidelines for reporting typing ambiguities. A best suitable format for optimal allelic and haplotypic HLA frequency estimations, based on the list of allele pairs that account for the genotyping information, has been published. Other formats that allow to express ambiguities without simplifying the data can also be used.\n\nSamples are used to provide allele frequency estimates for populations. For HLA \"loci\", the presence of ambiguities and that of putative recessive-like undetected alleles require the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg. HLA-NET explicitly requests that frequency estimates, for alleles or haplotypes, be validated by checking their conformity with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. If Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is rejected then the frequencies can not be taken as representative of the population. The causes for deviation should be looked for and, if possible, addressed. In any case, non Hardy-Weinberg frequencies should never be used as valid population estimates.\n\nBesides the guidelines above, the HLA-NET network made a contributions in the following areas\n\nThe most fine grained map of HLA distribution in the pan-European region is a result of cooperation with the AHPD – Analysis of HLA Populations Data – component of the International Histocompatibility Workshops. Besides the well-known pan-European gradients, originally reported by Cavalli-Sforza, local differentiations emerge, most notably the Alps appear as a genetic barrier to gene flow across Europe.\n\nRegistries have moderate to huge data sets, but the recruitment often is not performed in such a way that registry data can be considered as representative of the population. However, under certain conditions, it is possible to assess if a given registry might be used as a population sample or not. Undergoing work is being conducted to formalise the constraints and the procedures required to use registry data as a proxy to population samples.\n\n"}
{"id": "5776590", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5776590", "title": "Hyperrealism (visual arts)", "text": "Hyperrealism (visual arts)\n\nHyperrealism is a genre of painting and sculpture resembling a high-resolution photograph. Hyperrealism is considered an advancement of Photorealism by the methods used to create the resulting paintings or sculptures. The term is primarily applied to an independent art movement and art style in the United States and Europe that has developed since the early 1970s. Carole Feuerman is the forerunner in the hyperrealism movement along with Duane Hanson and John De Andrea.\n\nBelgian art dealer Isy Brachot coined the French word \"Hyperréalisme\", meaning Hyperrealism, as the title of a major exhibition and catalogue at his gallery in Brussels in 1973. The exhibition was dominated by such American Photorealists as Ralph Goings, Chuck Close, Don Eddy, Robert Bechtle and Richard McLean; but it included such influential European artists as Domenico Gnoli, Gerhard Richter, Konrad Klapheck, and . Since then, \"Hyperealisme\" has been used by European artists and dealers to apply to painters influenced by the Photorealists. Among contemporary European hyperrealist painters we find Gottfried Helnwein (Austrian), Willem van Veldhuizen and Tjalf Sparnaay (Dutch), Roger Wittevrongel (Belgian), as well as the French Pierre Barraya, Jacques Bodin, Ronald Bowen, François Bricq, Gérard Schlosser, Jacques Monory, Bernard Rancillac, Gilles Aillaud and Gérard Fromanger.\n\nEarly 21st century Hyperrealism was founded on the aesthetic principles of Photorealism. American painter Denis Peterson, whose pioneering works are universally viewed as an offshoot of Photorealism, first used \"Hyperrealism\" to apply to the new movement and its splinter group of artists. Graham Thompson wrote \"One demonstration of the way photography became assimilated into the art world is the success of photorealist painting in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It is also called super-realism or hyper-realism and painters like Richard Estes, Denis Peterson, Audrey Flack, and Chuck Close often worked from photographic stills to create paintings that appeared to be photographs.\"\n\nHowever, Hyperrealism is contrasted with the literal approach found in traditional photorealist paintings of the late 20th century. Hyperrealist painters and sculptors use photographic images as a reference source from which to create a more definitive and detailed rendering, one that often, unlike Photorealism, is narrative and emotive in its depictions. Strict Photorealist painters tended to imitate photographic images, omitting or abstracting certain finite detail to maintain a consistent over-all pictorial design. They often omitted human emotion, political value, and narrative elements. Since it evolved from Pop Art, the photorealistic style of painting was uniquely tight, precise, and sharply mechanical with an emphasis on mundane, everyday imagery.\n\nHyperrealism, although photographic in essence, often entails a softer, much more complex focus on the subject depicted, presenting it as a living, tangible object. These objects and scenes in Hyperrealism paintings and sculptures are meticulously detailed to create the illusion of a reality not seen in the original photo. That is not to say they're surreal, as the illusion is a convincing depiction of (simulated) reality. Textures, surfaces, lighting effects, and shadows appear clearer and more distinct than the reference photo or even the actual subject itself.\n\nHyperrealism has its roots in the philosophy of Jean Baudrillard, \"the simulation of something which never really existed.\" As such, Hyperrealists create a false reality, a convincing illusion based on a simulation of reality, the digital photograph. Hyperreal paintings and sculptures are an outgrowth of extremely high-resolution images produced by digital cameras and displayed on computers. As Photorealism emulated analog photography, Hyperrealism uses digital imagery and expands on it to create a new sense of reality. Hyperrealistic paintings and sculptures confront the viewer with the illusion of manipulated high-resolution images, though more meticulous.\n\nThe Hyperrealist style focuses much more of its emphasis on details and the subjects. Hyperreal paintings and sculptures are not strict interpretations of photographs, nor are they literal illustrations of a particular scene or subject. Instead, they use additional, often subtle, pictorial elements to create the illusion of a reality which in fact either does not exist or cannot be seen by the human eye. Furthermore, they may incorporate emotional, social, cultural and political thematic elements as an extension of the painted visual illusion; a distinct departure from the older and considerably more literal school of Photorealism.\n\nHyperrealist painters and sculptors make allowances for some mechanical means of transferring images to the canvas or mold, including preliminary drawings or grisaille underpaintings and molds. Photographic slide projections or multi media projectors are used to project images onto canvases and rudimentary techniques such as gridding may also be used to ensure accuracy. Sculptures utilize polyesters applied directly onto the human body or mold. Hyperrealism requires a high level of technical prowess and virtuosity to simulate a false reality. As such, Hyperrealism incorporates and often capitalizes upon photographic limitations such as depth of field, perspective and range of focus. Anomalies found in digital images, such as fractalization, are also exploited to emphasize their digital origins by some Hyperrealist painters, such as Chuck Close, Denis Peterson, Bert Monroy and Robert Bechtle.\n\nSubject matter ranges from portraits, figurative art, still life, landscapes, cityscapes and narrative scenes. The more recent hyperrealist style is much more literal than Photorealism as to exact pictorial detail with an emphasis on social, cultural or political themes. This also is in stark contrast to the newer concurrent Photorealism with its continued avoidance of photographic anomalies. Hyperrealist painters at once simulate and improve upon precise photographic images to produce optically convincing visual illusions of reality, often in a social or cultural context.\n\nSome hyperrealists have exposed totalitarian regimes and third world military governments through their narrative depictions of the legacy of hatred and intolerance. Denis Peterson and Gottfried Helnwein depicted political and cultural deviations of societal decadence in their work. Peterson's work focused on diasporas, genocides and refugees. Helnwein developed unconventionally narrative work that centered on past, present and future deviations of the Holocaust. Provocative subjects include enigmatic imagery of genocides, their tragic aftermath and the ideological consequences. Thematically, these controversial hyperreal artists aggressively confronted the corrupted human condition through narrative paintings as a phenomenological medium. These lifelike paintings are an historical commentary on the grotesque mistreatment of human beings.\n\nHyperreal paintings and sculptures further create a tangible solidity and physical presence through subtle lighting and shading effects. Shapes, forms and areas closest to the forefront of the image visually appear beyond the frontal plane of the canvas; and in the case of sculptures, details have more clarity than in nature. Hyperrealistic images are typically 10 to 20 times the size of the original photographic reference source, yet retain an extremely high resolution in color, precision and detail. Many of the paintings are achieved with an airbrush, using acrylics, oils or a combination of both. Ron Mueck's lifelike sculptures are scaled much larger or smaller than life and finished in incredibly convincing detail through the meticulous use of polyester resins and multiple molds. Bert Monroy's digital images appear to be actual paintings taken from photographs, yet they are fully created on computers.\n\n"}

It combines details from all four \"Indiana Jones\" features into one continuous adventure with a humorous twist, and includes several inside-jokes for fans of both the \"Indiana Jones\" films and the \"Star Wars\" series.\n\nAll four chapters, which combine to form a so-called \"mini-epic\", aired on Cartoon Network from May 10, 2008 and could be seen at the Lego \"Indiana Jones\" page on the Cartoon Network website, as well as on the Lego Indiana Jones website.\n\nPedersen had previously spoofed the \"Indiana Jones\" films in his music video for \"Doctor Jones\" (1997), a hit song by the Danish/Norwegian dance-pop group Aqua.\n\n\"Lego Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Brick\" was followed by \"\" in 2009, also directed by Pedersen.\n\n\"Raiders of the Lost Brick\" opens up with Indiana Jones and Satipo in a jungle. The two face several traps along the way including a pit, but Indy and Satipo continue their journey. When Indiana Jones has to get across tiles that lead to the altar with the idol, he dances on them, leaving Satipo a bit confused. Once he crossed the tiles, Indy grabs the idol and runs as the temple collapses. Satipo crosses the pit first, and gestures for the idol in exchange for giving Indy the whip. Indy throws the idol, but it hits Satipo in the head and knocks him out. Indy then builds a bridge out of Lego pieces to get across the pit, and once he crosses it he retrieves the whip and idol. The boulder trap is triggered, but Indy was able to escape. Once outside of the temple, he finds René Belloq waiting for him with two Hovitos warriors(who look like the Ugah warriors in chapter 3). Suddenly, the boulder crashes through the doorway where it was stuck and flattens René Belloq and the Hovitos, as Indy jumps away into Jock's seaplane, where Indy is seen with a check list and crosses \"Idol\" off the list.\n\nIndiana Jones and Marion Ravenwood are seen in a tomb with the Ark of the Covenant. As they try to fend off snakes, two German soldiers hoist the Ark out of the tomb, Indy and Marion then build a Lego elevator to escape the tomb. Indy and Marion safely get out of the tomb, and Indy goes on a horse to chase the truck that has the Ark. Indiana spots his father, Henry Jones Sr., reading a book about golf on a motorcycle. Indy jumps into the motorcycle and drives it. German soldiers on motorcycles drive toward the two and Indy grabs a flag, and knocks down both soldiers, and then uses his whip to get himself on top of the truck. The driver stops abruptly, and Indy falls onto the hood of the truck, he then accidentally pulls a piece of the hood off and falls, and goes under the truck until he reappears clinging to his whip, which was still hanging there from when he got on the truck. The grill of the truck breaks off and goes under it. Indy gets onto the grill and surfs on it, then leaps into the truck, and knocks the two German soldiers, a window frame, and a Stormtrooper out of the truck. Indy gets to the driver and pushes him out as well. Indy drives the truck, and his father then joins him to ride off into the distance.\n\nThis chapter opens up with Indy riding an amphibious vehicle in a river in a jungle. Mutt Williams comes out of a pitched tent and is delighted to see Indy coming back, but when Indy's vehicle gets on land and accidentally runs over Mutt's motorcycle, Mutt gets angry briefly. Indy shows Mutt the checklist with \"Idol\" and \"Ark\" checked off. The only unchecked item on the list is \"Skull\", and the two journey into the jungle. Suddenly, a rumbling sound is heard in the distance, and cutting through the jungle is Irina Spalko on a jungle cutter. The two run from and escape the cutter by falling into a ditch. They find themselves on a mine car, which runs down a track, around a rollercoaster-style loop and out a door that literally says \"END OF RIDE\". They see the jungle cutter again, and they continue running from it. When they go under an archway towards the temple and the jungle cutter tries to follow, it crashes. Spalko is then thrown off the vehicle and the jungle cutter gets destroyed. It forms a new machine with a saw blade, and Indy and Mutt decide to cut some pepperoni with it. Later, Indy and Mutt arrive at the temple entrance, but two natives stop them. They point to Indy, then Mutt, and then to a sign that says a person had to be as tall as a part of their spear to enter. Mutt is too short to go in, much to Indy's laughter, but he is able to go in anyway. Inside the temple, Indiana and Mutt run from spears (which eventually hit a dart board) until they come across a mirror. Indy's reflection is Han Solo (hinting that both Indiana Jones and Han Solo were played by Harrison Ford), and Mutt's reflection is of Chewbacca, (probably because he's seen as a companion to Indy, like Chewbacca is Han Solo's companion). Later, while Irina and Mutt are in a sword duel, Indy takes the Crystal Skull from one of the skeletons. The temple collapses behind the two, probably leaving Irina to be crushed after falling in a light-filled chasm to her death, and a close-up shows the skull as the movie ends.\n\nOn Cartoon Network and on its website, Chapter 3 replays and then Chapter 4 starts. But on the Lego Indiana Jones website, Chapter 3 does not repeat itself, as all four chapters are presented together in the order they were released.\n\nThe chapter begins at a party at Indy's place. Mutt hangs the Crystal Skull on a string together with other lanterns and seems to be a good bug electrifier. The Idol is used as a candle holder and the Ark is used as a grill (producing a thunderstorm during its use). Indy uses a spatula to flip and serve a burger. And Henry Jones Sr. (using the Holy Grail as a cup) toasts glasses with Mutt's cup. It is then revealed that the film was being watched in a movie theater by Lego versions of Steven Spielberg (wearing an \"E.T. II\" hat) and George Lucas, who nod at each other as the movie ends and give each other a high-five with a whip crack.\n\n"}
{"id": "435079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=435079", "title": "Lenition", "text": "Lenition\n\nIn linguistics, lenition is a kind of sound change that alters consonants, making them more sonorous. The word \"lenition\" itself means \"softening\" or \"weakening\" (from Latin \"lenis\" \"weak\"). Lenition can happen both synchronically (i.e. within a language at a particular point in time) and diachronically (i.e. as a language changes over time). Lenition can involve such changes as making a consonant more sonorous, causing a consonant to lose its place of articulation (a phenomenon called \"debuccalization\", which turns a consonant into a glottal consonant like or ), or even causing a consonant to disappear entirely.\n\nAn example of synchronic lenition in American English is found in flapping in some dialects: the of a word like \"wait\" becomes the more sonorous in the related form \"waiting\" . Some dialects of Spanish show debuccalization of to at the end of a syllable, so that a word like \"we are\" is pronounced . An example of diachronic lenition can be found in the Romance languages, where the of Latin (\"father\", accusative) becomes in Italian and in Spanish , while in Catalan , French and Portuguese it has disappeared completely. Along with assimilation, lenition is one of the primary sources of phonological change of languages.\n\nIn some languages, lenition has been grammaticalized into a consonant mutation, which means it is no longer triggered by its phonological environment but is now governed by its syntactic or morphological environment. For example, in Welsh, the word \"cat\" begins with the sound , but after the definite article , the changes to : \"the cat\" in Welsh is . This was historically due to intervocalic lenition, but in the plural, lenition does not happen, so \"the cats\" is , not *. The change of to in is thus caused by the syntax of the phrase, not by the phonological position of the consonant .\n\nThe opposite of lenition, fortition, a sound change that makes a consonant \"stronger\", is less common.\n\nLenition involves changes in manner of articulation, sometimes accompanied by small changes in place of articulation. There are two main lenition pathways: opening and sonorization. In both cases, a stronger sound becomes a weaker one. Lenition can be seen as a movement on the sonority hierarchy from less sonorous to more sonorous, or on a strength hierarchy from stronger to weaker.\n\nIn examples below, a greater-than sign indicates that one sound changes to another. The notation > means that changes to .\n\nThe sound change of palatalization sometimes involves lenition.\n\nLenition includes the loss of a feature, such as deglottalization, in which glottalization or ejective articulation is lost: or > .\n\nThe tables below show common sound changes involved in lenition. In some cases, lenition may skip one of the sound changes. The change voiceless stop > fricative is more common than the series of changes voiceless stop > affricate > fricative.\n\nIn the opening type of lenition, the articulation becomes more open with each step. Opening lenition involves several sound changes: shortening of double consonants, affrication of stops, spirantization of stops or affricates, debuccalization, and finally elision.\n\nThe sonorization type involves voicing. Sonorizing lenition involves several sound changes: voicing, approximation, and vocalization.\n\nSonorizing lenition occurs especially often intervocalically (between vowels). In this position, lenition can be seen as a type of assimilation of the consonant to the surrounding vowels, in which features of the consonant that are not present in the surrounding vowels (e.g. obstruction, voicelessness) are gradually eliminated.\n\nSome of the sounds generated by lenition are often subsequently \"normalized\" into related but cross-linguistically more common sounds. An example would be the changes → → and → → . Such normalizations correspond to diagonal movements down and to the right in the above table. In other cases, sounds are lenited and normalized at the same time; examples would be direct changes → or → .\n\n\"L\"-vocalization is a subtype of the sonorization type of lenition. It has two possible results: a velar approximant or back vowel, or a palatal approximant or front vowel. In French, \"l\"-vocalization of the sequence resulted in the diphthong , which was monophthongized, yielding the monophthong in Modern French.\n\nSometimes a particular example of lenition mixes the opening and sonorization pathways. For example, may spirantize or open to , then voice or sonorize to .\n\nLenition can be seen in Canadian and American English, where and soften to a tap (flapping) when not in initial position and followed by an unstressed vowel. For example, both \"rate\" and \"raid\" plus the suffix \"-er\" are pronounced . In many British English dialects, a different lenition that affects only takes place: > (see T-glottalization). The Italian of Central and Southern Italy has a number of lenitions, the most widespread of which is the deaffrication of to between vowels: post-pausal 'dinner' but post-vocalic 'the dinner'; the name , although structurally , is normally pronounced . In Tuscany, likewise is realized between vowels, and in typical speech of Central Tuscany, the voiceless stops in the same position are pronounced respectively , as in → 'the house', → 'hole'.\n\nDiachronic lenition is found, for example, in the change from Latin into Spanish, in which the intervocalic voiceless stops first changed into their voiced counterparts , and later into the approximants or fricatives : > , > , > , > . One stage in these changes goes beyond phonetic to have become a phonological restructuring, e.g. > (compare in Italian, with no change in the phonological status of ). The subsequent further weakening of the series to phonetic , as in is diachronic in the sense that the developments took place over time and displaced as the normal pronunciations between vowels. It is also synchronic in an analysis of as allophonic realizations of : illustrating with , 'wine' is pronounced after pause, but with intervocalically, as in 'of wine'; likewise, → . \n\nA similar development occurred in the Celtic languages, where non-geminate intervocalic consonants were converted into their corresponding weaker counterparts through lenition (usually stops into fricatives but also laterals and trills into weaker laterals and taps), and voiceless stops became voiced. For example, Indo-European intervocalic * in \"*\" \"people\" resulted in Proto-Celtic , Primitive Irish \"*\", Old Irish and ultimately complete deletion in modern Scots Gaelic .\n\nAn example of historical lenition in the Germanic languages is evidenced by Latin-English cognates such as , vs. \"father\", \"thin\". The Latin words preserved the original stops, which became fricatives in old Germanic by Grimm's law. A few centuries later, the High German consonant shift led to a second series of lenitions in Old High German, chiefly of post-vocalic stops, as evidenced in the English-German cognates \"ripe\", \"water\" vs. , .\n\nAlthough actually a much more profound change encompassing syllable restructuring, simplification of geminate consonants as in the passage from Latin to Spanish such as CUPPA > 'cup' is often viewed as a type of lenition (compare geminate-preserving Italian ).\n\nLike other Western Romance languages, many varieties of Sardinian offer an example of sandhi where the rule of intervocalic lenition extends across word boundaries. Since it is a fully active synchronic rule, lenition is not normally indicated in the normal orthography.\n\nA series of synchronic lenitions involving opening, or loss of occlusion, rather than voicing is found for post-vocalic in much of Tuscany, in Central Italy. Stereotypical Florentine, for example, has the of as 'house' in a post-pause realization, 'in (the) house' post-consonant, but 'the house' intervocalically. Word-internally, the normal realization is also : 'hole' → .\n\nIn the Celtic languages, the phenomenon of intervocalic lenition historically extended across word boundaries. This explains the rise of grammaticalised initial consonant mutations in modern Celtic languages through the loss of endings. A Scottish Gaelic example would be the lack of lenition in (\"the man\") and lenition in (\"the woman\"). The following examples show the development of a phrase consisting of a definite article plus a masculine noun (taking the ending ) compared with a feminine noun taking the ending . The historic development of lenition in these two cases can be reconstructed as follows:\n\nSynchronic lenition in Scottish Gaelic affects almost all consonants (except which has lost its lenited counterpart in most areas). Changes such as to involve the loss of secondary articulation; in addition, → involves the reduction of a trill to a tap. The spirantization of Gaelic nasal to is unusual among forms of lenition, but is triggered by the same environment as more prototypical lenition. (It may also leave a residue of nasalization in adjacent vowels. The orthography shows this by inserting an (except after ):\n\nSome languages which have lenition have in addition complex rules affecting situations where lenition might be expected to occur but does not, often those involving homorganic consonants. In Scottish Gaelic, for example, there are three homorganic groups:\nIn a position where lenition is expected due to the grammatical environment, lenition tends to be blocked if there are two adjacent homorganic consonants across the word boundary. For example:\nIn modern Scottish Gaelic this rule is only productive in the case of dentals but not the other two groups for the vast majority of speakers. It also does not affect all environments any more. For example, while still invokes the rules of blocked lenition, a noun followed by an adjective generally no longer does so. Hence:\nThere is a significant number of frozen forms involving the other two groups (labials and velars) and environments as well, especially in surnames and place names:\nThough rare, in some instances the rules of blocked lenition can be invoked by lost historical consonants, for example, in the case of the past-tense copula , which in Common Celtic had a final -t. In terms of blocked lenition, it continues to behave as a dental-final particle invoking blocked lenition rules:\n\nBlocked lenition phenomena are also known to occur in Irish and Spanish (orthographic b d g retained as following nasals rather than their normal lenited forms ).\n\nIn the modern Celtic languages, lenition of the \"fricating\" type is usually denoted by adding an \"h\" to the lenited letter. In Welsh, for example, , , and change into , , as a result of the so-called \"aspirate mutation\" (, \"stone\" → \"her stone\"). An exception is Manx orthography, which tends to be more phonetic, although in some cases etymological principles are applied. In the Gaelic script, fricating lenition (usually called simply \"lenition\") is indicated by a dot above the affected consonant, while in the Roman script, the convention is to suffix the letter to the consonant, to signify that it is lenited. Thus, is equivalent to . In Middle Irish manuscripts, lenition of and was indicated by the dot above, while lenition of , , and was indicated by the postposed ; lenition of other letters was not indicated consistently in the orthography.\n\nVoicing lenition is represented by a simple letter switch in the Brythonic languages, for instance , \"stone\" → , \"the stone\" in Welsh. In Irish orthography, it is shown by writing the \"weak\" consonant alongside the (silent) \"strong\" one: , \"pen\" → \"our pen\", , \"head\" → \"our head\" (sonorization is traditionally called \"eclipsis\" in Irish grammar). \n\nAlthough nasalization as a feature also occurs in most Scottish Gaelic dialects, it is not shown in the orthography on the whole as it is synchronic (i.e., the result of certain types of nasals affecting a following sound), rather than the diachronic Irish type sonorization (i.e., following historic nasals). For example \"house\" → \"the house\".\n\nThe phenomenon of consonant gradation in Samic and Finnic languages is also a form of lenition.\n\nAn example with geminate consonants comes from Finnish, where geminates become simple consonants while retaining voicing or voicelessness (e.g. → , → ). It is also possible for entire consonant clusters to undergo lenition, as in Votic, where voiceless clusters become voiced, e.g. \"to cry\" → .\n\nIf a language has no obstruents other than voiceless stops, other sounds are encountered, as in Finnish, where the lenited grade is represented by chronemes, approximants, taps or even trills. For example, Finnish used to have a complete set of spirantization reflexes for , though these have been lost in favour of similar-sounding phonemes. In Pohjanmaa Finnish, was changed into , thus the dialect has a synchronic lenition of an alveolar stop into an alveolar trill . Furthermore, the same phoneme undergoes assibilation → before the vowel , e.g. root \"water\" → and . Here, is the stem, is its nominative, and is the same stem under consonant gradation.\n\nFortition is the opposite of lenition: a consonant mutation in which a consonant changes from one considered weak to one considered strong. Fortition is less frequent than lenition in the languages of the world, but word-initial and word-final fortition is fairly frequent.\n\nItalian, for example, presents numerous regular examples of word-initial fortition both historically (Lat. with initial > , with ) and synchronically (e.g., \"house, home\" → but \"at home\" → ).\n\nCatalan is among numerous Romance languages with diachronic word-final devoicing ( > > . Fortition also occurs in Catalan for in consonant clusters with a lateral consonant (Lat. > or .\n\nWord-medially, is subject to fortition in numerous Romance languages, ranging from in many speech types on Italian soil to in some varieties of Spanish.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45697968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45697968", "title": "Male gaze", "text": "Male gaze\n\nIn feminist theory, the male gaze is the act of depicting women and the world, in the visual arts and literature, from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as sexual objects for the pleasure of the male viewer. The male gaze has three perspectives: (i) that of the person behind the camera, (ii) that of the characters within the representation, and (iii) that of the spectator.\n\nThe film critic Laura Mulvey coined the term \"male gaze\", which is contrasted with the concept of the female gaze; as such, the male gaze is comparable to scopophilia, which is sexual pleasure derived from observing the passive female as object.\n\nThe concept of the male gaze was first developed by the feminist film critic Laura Mulvey in the essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" (1975), in which she proposes that an asymmetry of power between the sexes is a controlling force in cinema; and that the male gaze is constructed for the pleasure of the male viewer, which is deeply rooted in the ideologies and discourses of patriarchy. Conceptually, the male gaze is a prominent element of feminist film theory and media studies, and is linked to models of voyeurism, scopophilia, and narcissism.\n\nThe perspective of the male gaze occurs when the camera places the viewer in the perspective of a heterosexual man whose sight lingers on the curves of a woman's body. Usually, the male gaze displays the woman on two different levels: (i) as an erotic object for the characters in the film story, and (ii) as an erotic object for the male viewer of the film. By way of the male gaze, the man emerges as the dominant power within the film fantasy, in which the woman is a passive object for the active gaze of the male viewer. The passive-object and active-viewer pairing is basic to the patriarchal order, and is typical in the \"illusionistic narrative film\" of mainstream cinema, where the male gaze has precedence over the female gaze — the underlying asymmetry of social and political power, between the sexes.\n\nThis inequality can be attributed to patriarchy which has been defined as a social ideology embedded in the belief systems of Western culture and in patriarchal societies. It is either masculine individuals or institutions created by these individuals that exert the power to determine what is considered \"natural\". Over the course of time, these constructed beliefs begin to seem \"natural\" or \"normal\" because they are prevalent and carry out unchallenged, thus arguing that Western culture has adopted a dyadic, hierarchical ideology which sets masculinity in binary opposition to femininity thus creating levels of inferiority.\n\nMulvey describes its two central forms that are based in Freud's concept of scopophilia, as: \"pleasure that is linked to sexual attraction (voyeurism in extremis) and scopophilic pleasure that is linked to narcissistic identification (the introjection of ideal egos)\", in order to demonstrate how women have historically been forced to view film through the \"male gaze\". It also suggests that the male gaze denies women their human identity, relegating them to the status of objects to be admired for physical appearance and male sexual desires and fantasies.\n\nIn \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\", Mulvey discusses several different types of spectatorship that may occur while viewing a film. They can involve unconsciously or, in some cases, consciously engaging in the typical, ascribed societal roles of men and women.\n\nIn relation to phallocentrism, films may be viewed in \"three different looks\"; the first refers to the camera as it records the actual events of the film, the second describes the nearly voyeuristic act of the audience as one engages in watching the film itself, and the third refers to the characters that interact with one another throughout the film. The main idea that seems to bring these actions together is that \"looking\" is generally seen as an active male role, while the passive role of being looked at is immediately adopted as a female characteristic. It is under the construction of patriarchy that Mulvey argues that women in film are tied to desire and that female characters hold an \"appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact\". The female actor is never meant to represent a character that directly affects the outcome of a plot or keep the story line going, but is inserted into the film as a way of supporting the male role and \"bearing the burden of sexual objectification\" that he cannot.\n\nIn other words, the woman is passive to the active gaze from the man and can be linked to scopophilia (or scoptophilia), which can be described as pleasure derived from looking. As an expression of sexuality, scopophilia refers to sexual pleasure derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, pornography, naked bodies, etc. \nIn sum, according to Mulvey, the categories of pleasurable viewing are twofold: voyeurism, which derives pleasure from viewing a distant other, and projecting one's fantasies, usually sexual, onto that person, and narcissism, a form of recognition of one's self in the image of another we are viewing. Mulvey also believes that in order to enjoy a film as a woman, or any gender other than male, we must learn to identify with the male protagonist. Wendy Arons adds that hypersexualization diminishes the symbolic threat posed by violent female characters in action films, \"The focus on the body—as a body in ostentatious display of breasts, legs, and buttocks—does mitigate the threat that women pose to 'the very fabric of... society' by reassuring the (male) viewer of his privilege as the possessor of the objectifying gaze.\"\n\nMulvey's essay also states that the female gaze is the same as the male gaze. This means that women look at themselves through the eyes of men. The male gaze may be seen by a feminist either as a manifestation of unequal power between gazer and gazed, or as a conscious or subconscious attempt to develop that inequality. From this perspective, a woman who welcomes an objectifying gaze may be simply conforming to norms established to benefit men, thereby reinforcing the power of the gaze to reduce a recipient to an object. Welcoming such objectification may be viewed as akin to exhibitionism.\n\nThe possibility of an analogous female gaze may arise from considering the male gaze. Mulvey argues that \"the male figure cannot bear the burden of sexual objectification. Man is reluctant to gaze\". Describing \"Wide Sargasso Sea\" (1966), by Jean Rhys, Nalini Paul indicates that the Antoinette character gazes at Rochester, placing a garland upon him, making him appear heroic: \"Rochester does not feel comfortable with having this role enforced upon him; thus, he rejects it by removing the garland, and crushing the flowers.\"\n\nFrom the male perspective, a man possesses the gaze because he is a man, whereas a woman has the gaze only when she assumes the male gazer role—when she objectifies others by gazing at them like a man. Eva-Maria Jacobsson supports Paul's description of the \"female gaze\" as \"a mere cross-identification with masculinity\", yet evidence of women's objectification of men—the discrete existence of a \"female gaze\"—can be found in the \"boy toy\" ads published in teen magazines, for example, despite Mulvey's contention that \"the gaze\" is \"property\" of one gender. Whether or not this is an example of female gaze or rather an internalized male gaze is up for debate, along with the other ideas on this subject. In terms of power relationships, the gazer can direct a gaze upon members of the same gender for asexual reasons, such as comparing the gazer's body image and clothing to those of the gazed-at individual.\n\nWith respect to her essay, Mulvey stressed in a 2011 interview with Roberta Sassatelli: \"First, that the 1975 article \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" was written as a polemic, and as Mandy Merck has described it, as a manifesto; so I had no interest in modifying the argument. Clearly I think, in retrospect from a more nuanced perspective, about the inescapability of the male gaze.\"\n\nBracha Ettinger criticizes this notion of the male gaze by her proposition of a \"matrixial gaze\". The matrixial gaze is not operative where a \"male gaze\" is placed opposite to a \"female gaze\" and where both positive entities constitute each other from a lack (such an umbrella concept of the gaze would precisely be what scholars such as Slavoj Žižek claim is the Lacanian definition of \"The Gaze\"). Ettinger's proposal doesn't concern a subject and its object, existing or lacking. Rather, it concerns \"trans-subjectivity\" and shareability on a partial level, and it is based on her claim concerning a feminine-matrixial difference that escapes the phallic opposition of masculine/feminine and is produced in a process of co-emergence. Ettinger works from the very late Lacan, yet, from the angle she brings, it is the structure of the Lacanian subject itself that is deconstructed to a certain extent, and another kind of feminine dimension appears, with its hybrid and floating matrixial gaze.\n\nIn the book \"Ways of Seeing\" (1972), John Berger addressed the subject of female sexual objectification in the arts, noting that \"according to usage and conventions, which are at last being questioned, but have by no means been overcome — men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at.\" Such usages and conventions of observation relate the objectifying male gaze to Lacan's theory of the social alienation that results from the psychological split, between seeing one's self and seeing the ideal of one's self. In Italian Renaissance painting, especially in the genre of the nude subject, that perceptual split arises from being both the viewer and the viewed, and from seeing one's self through the gaze of other people.\n\nGriselda Pollock, in her article, \"Modernity and the Spaces of Femininity\" argues that the female gaze can often be visually negated. Pollock claims Robert Doisneau's photo \"Sidelong Glance\" supports this argument. In the photo, a middle-aged bourgeois couple are looking around an art gallery. The spectator view of the picture is from inside the shop but the couple are looking in different places than the view of the spectator. The woman is commenting on an image to her husband, while the husband is being distracted by a nude female painting. The nude female painting is hung within view of the spectator. The woman is looking at another image, but it is out of view of the spectator. The man's gaze has found something more interesting and he has chosen to ignore the woman's comment. According to Pollock, \"She is contrasted iconographically to the naked woman. She is denied the picturing of her desire; what she looks at is blank for the spectator. She is denied being the object of desire because she is represented as a woman who actively looks, rather than returning and confirming the gaze of the masculine spectator\".\n\nLorraine Gamman has suggested that a female gaze can be distinguished from that of a male through its displacing of scopophilic power, not simply the inversion of the male gaze, which creates the possibility of a multiplicity of viewing angles. In fact, for Gamman, \"the female gaze cohabits the space occupied by men, rather than being entirely divorced from it\". Thus, for Gamman, the role of the female gaze is not to appropriate the traditional male form of \"voyeurism;\" its purpose is to disrupt the Phallocentric power of the male gaze by providing for other modes of looking.\n\nJay David Bolter and Richard Grusin suggest that Mulvey's \"male gaze\" coincides with \"the desire for visual immediacy\", the erasure of the medium for uninhibited interaction with the object portrayed, which feminist film theorists treat as \"a male desire that takes an overt sexual meaning when the object of representation, and therefore desire, is a woman\". However, Bolter and Grusin consider their term \"hypermediacy\", the drawing of attention to the medium (or media) and the mediating processes present in a work, to be a manifestation of Gamman's female gaze because it \"is multiple and deviant in its suggestion of multiplicity—a multiplicity of viewing positions and a multiplicity of relationships to the object in view, including sexual objects\". According to Bolter and Grusin, then, hypermediacy, much like the female gaze, works to disrupt the myopic and monolithic male gaze by offering more angles of viewing.\n\nAt the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, Jill Soloway, in her keynote address, tried to define the \"female gaze\" in film-making (available on YouTube).\n\nThe Indian photographer Farhat Basir Khan attributes the female gaze to anything that's been photographed by a woman which according to Khan is actually breaking the stereotypical view created by \"male-constructed\" photographs that have shown women in a certain light throughout the history of visual arts. The idea of female gaze was central to the exhibition curated by Khan titled 'Feminography' at the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts in January 2017.\n\nbell hooks, in her essay titled \"The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship\", argues that Black women are placed outside of the \"pleasure in looking\" as an imaginary subject to the male gaze. In reading Mulvey's essay \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\", hooks states,\"...from a standpoint that acknowledges race, one sees clearly why black women spectators not duped by mainstream cinema would develop an oppositional gaze\". In relation Lacan's mirror stage, during which a child develops self recognition and thus, the ideal ego, hooks takes up the oppositional gaze as a form of looking back, in search of the Black female body within the idealization of cinematic white womanhood.\n\nThe absence of racial relations in the context of feminist theory around the \"totalizing category [of] women\" engages in a process of denial which refutes the reality that many feminist film critics structure their discourse around white women. As a working-class Black woman interviewed by hooks replied, \"to see black women in the position white women have occupied in film forever...\", is to see a 'transfer' without 'transformation'. The oppositional gaze, therefore, encompasses resistance as well as an understanding and awareness of the politics of race and racism via cinematic whiteness inclusive of the male gaze.\n\n"}
{"id": "43082815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43082815", "title": "Maoism (Third Worldism)", "text": "Maoism (Third Worldism)\n\nMaoism (Third Worldism) (often stylized as Maoism–Third Worldism or simply MTW), not to be confused with Third Worldism generally, is a broad tendency which is mainly concerned with the infusion and synthesis of Marxism—particularly of the Marxist–Leninist–Maoist persuasion—with concepts of non-Marxist Third Worldism, namely dependency theory and world-systems theory. \n\nThere is no general consensus on part of Maoist-Third Worldists as a whole. However, the majority of proponents typically argue for the centrality of anti-imperialism to the victory of global communist revolution, as well as against the idea that the working class in the \"First World\" is majority-exploited (sometimes arguing that it experiences no exploitation at all), and therefore, it is not a part of the international proletariat.\n\nIn academic discourse, Maoism (Third-Worldism) is sometimes synonymous with \"dependency theory\" or \"Dependencism\".\n\nMaoism (Third Worldism) is defined, theoretically, by a variety of political principles which emphasize the enormous economic, social and political divisions which exist currently between the \"overdeveloped\" First World and the \"underdeveloped\" Third World. This is expressed through the lens of Maoist theory and practice, but brought into a new international understanding of imperialism and class in the context of the world which has been divided into two distinct camps: the exploited countries (the Third World) and their exploiters (the First World).\n\nAccording to the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement (RAIM), on the question of the principal theoretical observations of Maoism (Third Worldism) they state: \"Confronted by a complacent working class, served by an opportunist left, and alienated from the proletariat through the reception of surplus value drained from the Third World, we must understand the ideological and strategic implications of struggle from within the parasitic core. It benefits neither the left in the oppressor or the oppressed nations to pretend that the condition of the working class around the world is the same... To be a Third Worldist, in our view, is to be a principled internationalist.\"\n\nHowever the foundations of Maoism (Third Worldism) extend to encapsulate a great many strategic and theoretical developments in Marxist theory over the 20th century. Among them is the understanding of \"Global People's War\" being necessary as a military strategy for bringing an end to the historically unequal relationship built between the First and Third Worlds. This strategy includes the systematic \"de-linking\" of the exploited economies of Third World countries from the parasitic First World, and the unification of international forces to deprive the imperialist countries of resources and wealth extracted from Third World countries.\n\nThough this strategy has been drawn from several historical sources, such as Che Guevara's \"Message to the Tri-Continental\", it has most famously drawn on a quote from Lin Biao's speech \"Long Live the Victory of People's War!\" in 1965:\"Taking the entire globe, if North America and Western Europe can be called 'the cities of the world', then Asia, Africa and Latin America constitute 'the rural areas of the world'. Since World War II, the proletarian revolutionary movement has for various reasons been temporarily held back in the North American and West European capitalist countries, while the people’s revolutionary movement in Asia, Africa and Latin America has been growing vigorously. In a sense, the contemporary world revolution also presents a picture of the encirclement of cities by the rural areas. In the final analysis, the whole cause of world revolution hinges on the revolutionary struggles of the Asian, African and Latin American peoples who make up the overwhelming majority of the world’s population. The socialist countries should regard it as their internationalist duty to support the people’s revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\"\n\nFundamental, as well, to Maoism (Third Worldism) is an understanding of the \"Joint-Dictatorship of the Proletariat of Oppressed Nations\" (JDPON) and/or \"Global New Democratic Revolution\" (GNDR) which is proposed as a form of \"alter-globalization\" aimed at breaking the political and economic foundations of the economic parasitism between the First and Third Worlds. The JDPON is a point of relative contention between the various proponents of Maoism (Third Worldism) or at least the tendencies which have now been named as falling generally under the \"Third Worldist\" tendency within Marxism. The Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement, in their cardinal principles, describes the JDPON as: \"The necessary political strategy for world revolution to accompany the GPPW must result in the establishment of a Joint-Dictatorship of the Proletariat of Oppressed Nations (JDPON). Throughout the history of world imperialism there has been a massive accumulation of wealth in the core imperialist countries of the First World. We understand that to move forward in the hope of Communism without reconciling the vast division of wealth and labor between the First and Third Worlds can only produce social imperialism; Communism cannot be built over the hoards of stolen wealth in the core, to advance this contradiction must be resolved. To resolve this, and to sew together those movements who should coalesce in the global strategy of Global Protracted People’s War, we must have a Global New Democratic Revolution, in which a coalition toward the alter-globalization of the world is formed from the cooperation of the Proletarian and Progressive states of the oppressed countries, under the leadership of the Proletariat, to guide the revolutionary forces toward the defeat of imperialism. As well, to promote revolutionary consciousness and catalyze the development toward the JDPON: the global settling of accounts through which the means of production of the core countries are internationalized and their wealth is redistributed to those countries which have been historically robbed. It is through this process of JDPON that the contradiction between oppressor/oppressed nations is resolved and the oppressor countries are integrated into the world socialist project.\"However, the JDPON has also existed for quite a while longer than the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement, and was first formalized in its contemporary form by the Maoist Internationalist Movement in their article on the Dictatorship of the Proletariat: \"Because there is no exploited white working class in North Amerika, MIM favors the joint dictatorship of the proletariat of the oppressed nations (JDPON). This amounts to putting u.$. imperialism into receivership by something like a proletarian United Nations. The whole dictatorship of the proletariat idea or its current form required as JDPON is a strategy for advance from capitalism toward communism, in which dictatorship is only a stage existing until certain tasks eliminating classes are done.\"\n\nThe Maoist (Third Worldist) movement is currently mostly associated with organizations such as the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement and Maoist Internationalist Ministry of Prisons, (a branch-off from the Maoist Internationalist Movement, a now defunct organisation). Although MIM Prisons considers its ideology to be \"MIM Thought\", not Maoist (Third Worldist). The Communist Party of the Latin American and Caribbean Diaspora, also called \"Anticonquista\", considers itself a Third Worldist organization.\n\n\n"}

He is the one who played a pivotal role to give travelogue a 'literature form', was one of the most widely travelled scholars of India, spending forty-five years of his life on travels away from his home. \n\nHe travelled to many places and wrote many travelogue approximately in the same ratio. He is also famously known for his authentic description about his travels experiences, for instance- in his travelogue \"Meri Laddakh Yatra\" he presents overall regional, historical and cultural specificity of that region judiciously. He became a Buddhist monk (\"Bauddha Bhikkhu\") and eventually took up Marxist Socialism. Sankrityayan was also an Indian nationalist, having been arrested and jailed for three years for creating anti-British writings and speeches. He is referred to as the 'Greatest Scholar' (\"Mahapandit\") for his scholarship. He was both a polymath as well as a polyglot. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Bhushan in 1963.\n\nHe was born as Kedarnath Pandey in a poor Bhumihar Brahmin family on 9 April 1893 in Pandaha village, Azamgarh district, in Eastern Uttar Pradesh. He received formal schooling at a local primary school, though he later studied and mastered numerous languages independently, as well as the art of photography.\n\nIn his initial days he was a keen follower of Arya Samaj of Swami Dayananda Saraswati. Buddhism came to him and changed his life. He lost faith in God's existence but still retained faith in reincarnation. Later he moved towards Marxist Socialism and rejected the concepts of reincarnation and afterlife also. The two volumes of \"Darshan-Digdarshan\", the collected history of World's Philosophy give an indication of his philosophy when we find the second volume much dedicated to Dharmakirti's Pramana Vartika. This he discovered in Tibetan translation from Tibet.\n\nSankrityayan's travels took him to different parts of India including Ladakh, Kinnaur, and Kashmir. He also travelled to several other countries including Nepal, Tibet, Sri Lanka, Iran, China, and the former Soviet Union. He spent several years in the \"Parsa Gadh\" village in the Saran district in Bihar. The village's entry gate is named \"Rahul Gate\". While travelling, he mostly used surface transport, and he went to certain countries clandestinely; he entered Tibet as a Buddhist monk. He made several trips to Tibet and brought valuable paintings and Pali and Sanskrit manuscripts back to India. Most of these were a part of the libraries of Vikramshila and Nalanda Universities. These objects had been taken to Tibet by fleeing Buddhist monks during the twelfth and subsequent centuries when the invading Muslim armies had destroyed universities in India. Some accounts state that Rahul Sankrityayan employed twenty-two mules to bring these materials from Tibet to India. Patna Museum, Patna, has a special section of these materials in his honour, where a number of these and other items have been displayed.\n\nSankrityayan was a polyglot, well versed in several languages and dialects, including Hindi, Sanskrit, Pali, Bhojpuri, Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Tamil, Kannada, Tibetan, Sinhalese, French and Russian. He was also an Indologist, a Marxist theoretician, and a creative writer. He started writing during his twenties and his works, totalling well over 100, covered a variety of subjects, including sociology, history, philosophy, Buddhism, Tibetology, lexicography, grammar, textual editing, folklore, science, drama, and politics. Many of these were unpublished. He translated Majjhima Nikaya from Prakrit into Hindi.\n\nOne of his most famous books in Hindi is \"Volga Se Ganga\" (\"A journey from the Volga to the Ganges\") – a work of historical fiction concerning the migration of Aryans from the steppes of the Eurasia to regions around the Volga river; then their movements across the Hindukush and the Himalayas and the sub-Himalayan regions; and their spread to the Indo-Gangetic plains of the subcontinent of India. The book begins in 6000 BC and ends in 1942, the year when Mahatma Gandhi, the Indian nationalist leader called for the quit India movement. It was published in 1942. A translation into English of this work by Victor Kiernan was published in 1947 as \"From Volga to Ganga\". It was translated by K.N. Muthiya-Tamilputhakalayam in Tamil as \"Valgavil irundu gangai varai\" and is still considered a best-seller. The Kannada translation done by B.N Sharma as \"Volga Ganga\" . The Telugu translation (Volga nunchi Ganga ku) inspired many readers. \"Volga muthal Ganga vare\", the Malayalam translation, became immensely popular among the young intellectuals of Kerala and it continues to be one of the most influential books of its times. The Bengali version is \"Volga Theke Ganga\" [ভল্গা থেকে গঙ্গা], which is still acclaimed by the critics. \n\nHis most important travelogue literature is- \"Tibbat me Sava varsha(1933), \"Meri Europe Yatra\" (1935), \"Athato Ghumakkad Jigyasa\", \"Volga se Ganga\", \"Asia ke Durgam Bhukhando Mein\", \"Yatra Ke Panne\" and \"Kinnar Desh Mein\".\n\nMore than ten of his books have been translated and published in Bengali. \"Mahapandit\" was awarded the Padmabhushan in 1963, and he received the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1958 for his book \"Madhya Asia ka Itihaas\".\n\nHe maintained daily diaries in Sanskrit which were used fully while writing his autobiography. In spite of profound scholarship, he wrote in very simple Hindi that a common person could follow. He wrote books of varied interest. He was aware of limitations of Hindi literature and singularly made up the loss in no small measure.\n\nThe historian Kashi Prasad Jayaswal compared Rahul Sankrityayan with Buddha. Rahul's personality was as impressive and memorable as are his achievements. He traveled widely and wrote in five languages – Hindi, Sanskrit, Bhojpuri, Pāli and Tibetan. His published works span a range of genres, which include autobiography, biography, travelogue, sociology, history, philosophy, Buddhism, Tibetology, lexicography, grammar, text editing, folklore, science, fiction, drama, essays, politics, and pamphleteering.\n\nAlthough he had little formal education, in view of his knowledge and command over the subject, University of Leningrad appointed him Professor of Indology in 1937–38 and again in 1947–48.\n\nMany of Rahul's personal collections including the ones he gathered from his multiple trips to Tibet were distributed across to multiple Universities and Museums.\nPatna Museum has an extensive collection of Buddhist scrolls which he assimilated through his journeys across Tibet.Many of these are rare gems of Indian scriptures translated into Tibetan.\n\nRahul was married when very young and never came to know anything of his child-wife, Santoshi.Probably he saw her only once in his 40s as per his autobiography:Meri Jivan Yatra. \nDuring his stay in Soviet Russia a second time, accepting an invitation for teaching Buddhism at Leningrad University, he came in contact with a Mongolian scholar Lola (Ellena Narvertovna Kozerovskaya). She could speak French, English, and Russian and write Sanskrit. She helped him in working on Tibetan- Sanskrit dictionary. Their attachment ended in marriage and birth of son Igor. Mother and son were not allowed to accompany Rahul to India after completion of his assignment. It was Stalin's Russia.\n\nLate in life, he married Dr. Kamala, an Indian Nepali lady and had a daughter (Jaya), two sons (Jeta) and (Jayant) .\n\nRahul accepted a teaching job at a Sri Lankan University, where he fell seriously ill. Diabetes, high blood pressure and a mild stroke struck him. Most tragic happening was the loss of memory.

Since then, the \"Relación breve de la conquista de la Nueva España\" has been held along with other 16th century manuscripts in the library of the Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial.

{"id": "72554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72554", "title": "Sound bite", "text": "Sound bite\n\nA sound bite is a short clip of speech or music extracted from a longer piece of audio, often used to promote or exemplify the full length piece. In the context of journalism, a sound bite is characterized by a short phrase or sentence that captures the essence of what the speaker was trying to say, and is used to summarize information and entice the reader or viewer. The term was coined by the U.S. media in the 1970s. Since then, politicians have increasingly employed sound bites to summarize their positions.\n\nDue to its brevity, the sound bite often overshadows the broader context in which it was spoken, and can be misleading or inaccurate. The insertion of sound bites into news broadcasts or documentaries is open to manipulation, leading to conflict over journalistic ethics.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, pressure from advertisers on the American television industry to create entertaining news material made sound bites central to political coverage. Politicians began to use PR techniques to craft self-images and slogans that would resonate with the television-viewing audience and ensure their victory in campaigns. The term \"sound bite\" was coined in the late 1970s, several years before the presidency of Ronald Reagan, who was famous for short, memorable phrases like, \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\" in reference to the Berlin Wall.\n\nDuring the 1988 United States presidential election, candidate Michael Dukakis highlighted the prominent role of sound bites and spin doctors in political campaigns by running a commercial that mocked contender George H.W. Bush's handlers' frustration over the gaffes of his vice presidential running-mate Dan Quayle.\n\nIn journalism, sound bites are used to summarize the position of the speaker, as well as to increase the interest of the reader or viewer in the piece. In both print and broadcast journalism, sound bites are conventionally juxtaposed and interspersed with commentary from the journalist to create a news story. A balanced news report is expected to contain sound bites representing both sides of the debate. This technique, however, can lead to biased reporting when a sound bite is selected for sensationalism, or is used to promote the point of view of one individual or group over another.\n\nIn his book \"The Sound Bite Society\", Jeffrey Scheuer argues that the sound bite was the product of television's increased power over all forms of communication, and that the resulting trend toward short, catchy snippets of information had a significant negative impact on American political discourse. In contrast, Peggy Noonan feels that sound bites have acquired a negative connotation but are not inherently negative, and that what we now think of as great historical sound bites—such as \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself\", the most famous phrase in Franklin D. Roosevelt's first Inaugural Address—were examples of eloquent speakers unselfconsciously and \"simply trying in words to capture the essence of the thought they wished to communicate.\"\n\nThe increased use of sound bites in news media has been criticized, and has led to discussions on journalistic and media ethics. According to the Code of Ethics of the Society of Professional Journalists, journalists should \"make certain that headlines, news teases and promotional material, photos, video, audio, graphics, sound bites and quotations do not misrepresent. They should not oversimplify or highlight incidents out of context.\" \n\nDespite this criticism, sound bites are widely employed by businesses, trade groups, labor unions and politicians. Senator Jim DeMint readily admitted this when he said, \"There’s a reason why most politicians talk in sanitized sound bites: Once you get out of that, you’re opening yourself up to get attacked.\" \n\n"}

The phrase may have originated with a pamphlet 'Speak truth to power: a Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence', published in 1955. Speak Truth To Power is also the title of a global Human Rights initiative under the auspices of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. Practitioners who have campaigned for a more just and truthful world have included Vaclav Havel, Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Dalai Lama and Elie Wiesel.\n\nIn classical Greece 'speaking truth to power' was known as parrhesia. The tactic is similar to Satyagraha (literally, 'truth-force') which was used by Mahatma Gandhi in seeking independence from British India. Albert O. Hirschman, writing in the 1970s, suggested that subordinates have three options; Exit, Voice, and Loyalty.\n\nAccording to Michel Foucault writing in 1983, only the courageous may pursue the truth-to-power course; they risk losing their friends, (as Winston Churchill did in the 1930s) their liberty, even their lives ( Liu Xiaobo).\n\nNoam Chomsky is dismissive of 'speaking truth to power'. He asserts that 'power knows the truth already, and is busy concealing it'. It is the oppressed who need to hear the truth, not the oppressors.\n\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov are among those who suffered for speaking out against the USSR. In 1936, Japanese finance minister Takahashi Korekiyo was assassinated after suggesting that Japan could not afford its planned military buildup. Dietrich Bonhoeffer in Nazi Germany, and Martin Luther King in the US, were people who lost their lives for speaking truth to power. The former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali was jailed in the 1960s for refusing to be drafted to the Vietnam war, saying; 'No Vietcong ever called me nigger...I have no quarrel with the Vietnamese people.'\n\nVaclav Havel in his \"Power of the Powerless\" essay wrote: \"The post-totalitarian system touches people at every step, but it does so with its ideological gloves on. This is why life in the system is so thoroughly permeated with hypocrisy and lies: government by bureaucracy is called popular government; the working class is enslaved in the name of the working class; the complete degradation of the individual is presented as his ultimate liberation; depriving people of information is called making it available; the use of power to manipulate is called the public control of power, and the arbitrary abuse of power is called observing the legal code; the repression of culture is called its development; the expansion of imperial influence is presented as support for the oppressed; the lack of free expression becomes the highest form of freedom; farcical elections become the highest form of democracy; banning independent thought becomes the most scientific of world views; military occupation becomes fraternal assistance. Because the regime is captive to its own lies, it must falsify everything. It falsifies the past. It falsifies the present, and it falsifies the future. It falsifies statistics\".\n\nEx-GCHQ employee Katharine Gun was threatened with prosecution for exposing an alleged conspiracy to bug United Nations delegates prior to the Iraq invasion of 2003. Together with Daniel Ellsburg, Coleen Rowley and Sibel Edmonds, she set up the Truth-telling Coalition to encourage more of their former colleagues to ‘tell truth to power’.\n\nThe reverend Nick Mercer, an assistant chaplain at Sherborne School, believes that Human Rights and morality should be taught in all schools. Mercer, who gave evidence on mistreatment of detainees in Iraq, once served as a military lawyer.\n\nAccording to Vaclav Havel, politics should not be ignored because it attracts bad people. It follows that politics requires people of exceptional purity, higher sensitivity, taste, tact and responsibility. ‘Those who say that politics is disreputable help make it so… Those who claim that politics is a dirty business are lying to us.’ \n\nMichel Foucault spoke and wrote about power and oppression by examining how \"technologies of power and knowledge have, since antiquity, intertwined and developed in concrete and historical frameworks\".\n\nPaulo Freire in his seminal work \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" explains how \"oppression has been justified and how it is reproduced through a mutual process between the \"oppressor\" and the \"oppressed\" (oppressors–oppressed distinction). Freire admits that the powerless in society can be frightened of freedom. He writes, \"Freedom is acquired by conquest, not by gift. It must be pursued constantly and responsibly. Freedom is not an ideal located outside of man; nor is it an idea which becomes myth. It is rather the indispensable condition for the quest for human completion\". According to Freire, freedom will be the result of praxis—informed action—when a balance between theory and practice is achieved\".\n\nThe story of Sophie Scholl and the White Rose has been filmed four times, including Die Weisse Rose in 1983, and \nRichard Attenborough's Gandhi (film) was a worldwide success in spite of one Hollywood mogul opining that the central character was a 'little brown man in a sheet whom nobody wants to see.'\n\n\"Speak Truth To Power: Human Rights Defenders Who Are Changing Our World\" is a 2003 book by Kerry Kennedy with photographs by Eddie Adams.

{"id": "525193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=525193", "title": "Spelling pronunciation", "text": "Spelling pronunciation\n\nA spelling pronunciation is the pronunciation of a word according to its spelling, at odds with a standard or traditional pronunciation. Words spelled with silent letters (e.g. \"island\", \"knife\"), or traditionally pronounced with reduced vowels or omitted consonants (e.g. \"cupboard\", \"Worcester\"), may be subject to a spelling pronunciation.\n\nIf a word's spelling was standardized prior to sound changes that produced its \"traditional\" pronunciation, a spelling pronunciation may reflect an even older pronunciation. This is often the case with compound words (e.g. \"waistcoat\", \"cupboard\", \"forehead\"). It is also the case for many words with silent letters (e.g. \"often\"), though not all—silent letters are sometimes added for etymological reasons, to reflect a word's spelling in its language of origin (e.g. \"victual\", rhyming with \"little\" but derived from Late Latin \"victualia\"). Some silent letters were added on the basis of erroneous etymologies, as in the cases of the words \"island\" and \"scythe\".\n\nSpelling pronunciations are generally considered incorrect next to the traditionally accepted, and usually more widespread, pronunciation. If a spelling pronunciation persists and becomes more common, it may eventually join the existing form as equally acceptable (for example \"waistcoat\" and \"often\"), or even become the dominant pronunciation (as with \"forehead\" and \"falcon\"). If a rare word is more often encountered in writing than in speech, the spelling pronunciation may be assumed by most, while the traditional pronunciation is maintained only by older or educated individuals.\n\nA large number of easily noticeable spelling pronunciations occurs only in languages such as French and English in which spelling tends to not indicate the current pronunciation. Because all languages have at least some words which are not spelled as pronounced, even those such as Finnish with most words being written phonetically, spelling pronunciations can arise in any language in which most people obtain only enough education to learn how to read and write but not enough to understand when the spelling fails to indicate the modern pronunciation. In other words, when many people do not clearly understand the relationship between spelling and pronunciation, spelling pronunciations are common.\n\nOn the other hand, spelling pronunciations are also evidence of the reciprocal effects of spoken and written language on each other. Many spellings represent older forms and corresponding older pronunciations. Some spellings, however, are not etymologically correct.\n\nThough many people may believe (to various degrees of accuracy) that the written language is \"more correct\", that, in turn, can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, with the written language affecting and changing the spoken language and resulting in a pronunciation that is similar to an older pronunciation or even to a new pronunciation that is suggested by the spelling but had never occurred before.\n\n\nSpelling pronunciations give rise to varied opinions. Often, those who retain the old pronunciation consider the spelling pronunciation to be a mark of ignorance or insecurity. Those who use a spelling pronunciation may not be aware that it is one and consider the historically-authentic version to be slovenly since it \"slurs over\" a letter. Conversely, the users of some innovative pronunciations such as \"Febuary\" (for \"February\") may regard the historically- and phonetically-authentic version to be a pedantic spelling pronunciation.\n\nHenry Watson Fowler (1858–1933) reports that in his day, there was a conscious movement among schoolteachers and others encouraging people to abandon anomalous traditional pronunciations and to \"speak as you spell\". According to major scholars of early modern English (Dobson, Wyld et al.), in the 17th century, there was already beginning an \"intellectual\" trend in England to \"pronounce as you spell\". That presupposes a standard spelling system, which was only beginning to form at the time.\nSimilarly, quite a large number of \"corrections\" slowly spread from scholars to the general public in France, starting several centuries ago.\n\nA different variety of spelling pronunciations are phonetic adaptations, pronunciations of the written form of foreign words within the frame of the phonemic system of the language that accepts them: an example of this process is \"garage\" ( in French) sometimes pronounced in English. Such adaptations are quite natural and often preferred by speech-conscious and careful speakers.\n\nChildren who read a great deal often produce spelling pronunciations since if they do not consult a dictionary, they have only the spelling to indicate the pronunciation of words that are uncommon in the spoken language. Well-read second language learners may also produce spelling pronunciations.\n\nIn some instances, a population in a formerly non-English speaking area may retain such second language markers in the now native-English speaking population. For example, Scottish Standard English is replete with spelling pronunciations from when Scots was subsumed by English in the 17th century.\n\nHowever, since there are many words that one reads far more often than one hears, adult native-language speakers are also affected. In such circumstances, the \"spelling pronunciation\" may well be more comprehensible than any other. That, in turn, leads to the language evolution mentioned above. What is a spelling pronunciation in one generation often becomes the standard pronunciation in the next.\n\nIn French, the modern pronunciation of the 16th-century French author Montaigne as , rather than the contemporary , is a spelling pronunciation.\n\nWhen English \"club\" was first borrowed into French, the approved pronunciation was /klab/, as being a reasonable approximation of the English. The standard then became /klyb/ on the basis of the spelling, and later, in Europe, /klœb/, deemed closer to the English original. The standard pronunciation in Quebec French remains [klʏb]. Similarly, \"shampooing\" \"product for washing the hair\" at the time of borrowing was but it is now \n\nIn Modern Hebrew, the word חֵטְא (, meaning 'sin') is sometimes pronounced , as suggested by its spelling, especially by children. Other examples of spelling pronunciations are the Sephardic Hebrew כָּל (, meaning all) being pronounced as and צָהֳרַיִם (, meaning noon) being pronounced as because of how the kamatz katan vowel point (אָ), which indicates , is visually identical to the kamatz, which indicates .\n\nIn Italian, a few early English loanwords are pronounced according to Italian spelling rules such as \"water\" ('toilet bowl', from English \"water (closet)\"), pronounced [ˈvater], and \"tramway\", pronounced [tranˈvai]. The Italian word \"ovest\" ('west') comes from a spelling pronunciation of French \"ouest\" (which, in turn, is a phonetic transcription of English \"west\"); that particular instance of spelling pronunciation must have occurred before the 16th century, when the letters u and v were still indistinct.\n\nA few foreign proper names are normally pronounced according to the pronunciation of the original language (or a close approximation of it), but they retain an older spelling pronunciation when they are used as parts of Italian street names. For exame, the name of Edward Jenner retains its usual English pronunciation in most contexts, but \"Viale Edoardo Jenner\" (a main street in Milan) is pronounced [ˈvjale edoˈardo 'jɛnner]. The use of such old-fashioned spelling pronunciations was probably encouraged by the custom of translating given names when streets were named after foreign people: \"Edoardo\" for \"Edward\", or \"Giorgio\" for \"George\" for \"Via Giorgio Washington\".\n\nIn Spanish, the \"ch\" in some German words is pronounced or ,instead of . Bach is correctly pronounced , and Kuchen is , but Rorschach is , rather than , Mach is or , and Kirchner is or . Other spelling pronunciations are club pronounced , iceberg pronounced in Spain (in the Americas, it is pronounced ), and \"folclor\" and \"folclore\" as translations of folklore, pronounced and . Also in Spanish, the acute accent in the French word \"élite\" is taken as a Spanish stress mark, and the word is pronounced .\n\nWhen Polish borrows words from English with their spelling preserved, the pronunciation tends to follow the rules of Polish. Words such as \"marketing\" are pronounced as spelled, instead of the more faithful \"markytyng\".\n\nIn Vietnamese, initial \"v\" is often pronounced like a \"y\" () in the central and southern varieties. However, in formal speech, speakers often revert to the spelling pronunciation, which is increasingly being used in casual speech as well.\n\n\n"}

It portrays the queen wearing a brocaded skirt and bodice and an open cloak with the insignia of the Order of the Garter; on her head is a small crown and in her hands she holds an orb and sceptre. The statue, carved from Portland stone, stands on a plinth of the same material with the inscription . The pedestal consists of a fat \"engaged\" cylinder with a flat volute on either side, each with scrolls adorned with carved flowers and leaves. Neither the sculptor's identity nor the exact date of the work are known, but it is probably of the early eighteenth century.\n\nWhen Queen Anne's Gate was built by the banker William Paterson in 1704–5, it originally formed two separate closes divided by a wall with two openings, with Queen Square to the west and Park Street to the east. The statue is first mentioned in Edward Hatton's \"A New View of London\" (1708) as being \"erected in full proportion on a pedestal at the E.End of Q[ueen]. \"Square\", \"Westminster\"\". An engraved map of 1710 depicts the statue of Queen Anne in the middle of the wall, flanked by the gateways on either side. At some point in the early 19th century the statue was moved to a new position in the square. The \"Gentleman's Magazine\" reported in 1814 that \"the statue until of late occupied a conspicuous situation on the East end of the square, but now we find it huddled up in a corner\".\n\nBy 1862, the statue had lost its nose and right arm. The Earl of Caernarvon and other local residents pressed the Office of Works to repair it, saying in a letter that the residents had long been dissatisfied with the statue's poor condition. His request received a favourable response from the First Commissioner of Works, William Cowper. Although Cowper regarded the statue as being of \"little merit as a work of art\", he did not \"think it desirable that a statue of an illustrious sovereign should be left in a public place without a nose or right arm.\" The sculptor John Thomas was hired to repair it. He based the face on a \"squeeze\" (plaster cast) of Francis Bird's statue of Queen Anne outside St Paul's Cathedral. The right arm was replaced with a marble substitute and a replacement bronze sceptre was also installed.\nThe statue's poor condition was due in large part to the local children's mistaken belief that the statue represented the ill-reputed Queen Mary. They would ask \"Bloody Queen Mary\" to come down from her pedestal, and upon \"receiving, naturally, no response, [they would] assail it with missiles\". Cowper recommended in 1862 that \"if the name of Queen Anne be written in legible characters on the pedestal, their puerile outrage will not be repeated.\" The inscription was therefore added by John Thomas as part of his restoration work. Nonetheless the vandalism continued, and it was not until a generation later that the complaints ceased. Another legend concerning the statue holds that on 1 August, the anniversary of Queen Anne's death, the statue climbs down and walks three times up and down the street.\n\nThe dividing wall between the two streets was demolished in 1873 to form the present Queen Anne's Square, and at that time the statue was removed to its present position. It became the subject of a long-running dispute over ownership, as it was not brought into the care of the Office of Works when the Public Statues Act 1854 was enacted. The owner of 15 Queen Anne's Gate permitted the Office of Works to carry out repairs in 1862 but objected to its removal and did not transfer it into public ownership.\n\nIn 1938, the house's then owner, E. Thornton Smith, carried out repairs at his own expense. He resolved the question of ongoing maintenance through his position as Master of the Worshipful Company of Gardeners by presenting the statue to the Company and arranging that it would pay for any future repairs with the Office of Works carrying out the work. An 18-inch thick brick wall was built around the statue in 1940 to protect it from enemy bombing during the Second World War; it was only in April 1947 that the wall was removed.\n\n"}
{"id": "5569214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5569214", "title": "Taʻovala", "text": "Taʻovala\n\nA taovala is a Tongan dress, a mat wrapped around the waist, worn by men and women, at all formal occasions, much like the tie for men in the European and North American culture. The ta'ovala is also commonly seen among the Fijian Lau Islands, a region once heavily influenced by Tongan hegemony and cultural diffusion.\n\nAccording to a Tongan story, a group of Tongans once arrived by boat at the Tui Tonga. They had had a rough ride and their clothing, if any remained, was not respectable. They cut the sail of their boat (Polynesian sails are also mats) in pieces and wrapped them around. The king was so pleased by the sacrifice they had made to him of their expensive sail that he ordered this dress to be court dress from then on. The Tongan waist-mat probably shares a common origin or inspiration as the Samoan \"valatau\" or \"vala\" waistband often donned by orators and chiefly sons (\"manaia\") and daughters (\"taupou\") on festive occasions and rituals.\n\nQueen Salote Tupou III ordered the taovala to be part of the civil servants' uniform. The use of the taovala for men is therefore extremely common in Tonga. For women it is somewhat less common, as they prefer a kiekie.\n\nThe normal taovala, for everyday neat wear, is a short mat, coming halfway up the thighs. It is tied with a rope (\"kafa\", often made of coconut coir or of human hair of a deceased ancestor) wrapped around the waist. The mat worn on festive occasions, like a marriage, is much larger and often very nicely decorated. Likewise the taovala for a funeral is also a huge mat, but much coarser, not decorated. If the wearer has an inferior rank towards the deceased, the mat is old and torn. The older and more torn it is, the better. All these special mats are kept as precious heirlooms.\n\nTaovala are part of the koloa, the handicraft goods made by the women. Every woman can do it. If girls do not learn it at home, it will be taught at school. More recently, however, some women specialise in the handicraft and sell their products on the market.\n\nTaovala can be made from different materials, natural and introduced:\n\nBefore the advent of Western influence, the men wore a fringe skirt of native materials about long. Women traditionally wore two mats about a yard (metre) square each, made by weaving pandanus and hibiscus leaves together, and belted around the waist. Children were usually naked. The Christian missionaries who began arriving in the late 19th century influenced the islanders' notions of modesty.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30782336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30782336", "title": "Tejo Power Station", "text": "Tejo Power Station\n\nThe Tejo Power Station was a thermoelectric power plant owned by the \"Companhias Reunidas de Gás e Electricidade\" (CRGE – United Gas and Electric Companies), which supplied power to the city and entire Lisbon region. \n\nIt is located in the Belém district of Portugal's capital and its activity spanned from 1909 to 1972, although as of 1951 it was used as a reserve power station. Over time, it underwent several adjustments and expansions, going through many different phases of construction and production. \n\nIt now houses the Museu da Electricidade (Electricity Museum)\n\nThe original Tejo Power Station, whose buildings no longer exist, was built in 1909 and operated until 1921. In 1914, construction began on the low pressure boiler buildings and the machinery room, which were later expanded several times. Finally, in 1941 construction on the high pressure boiler building took place, the power station's largest structure, which was expanded in 1951 with the addition of another boiler.\n\nDespite operating for the last time in 1972, it was only officially shut down in 1975, thus proving its great importance to the city of Lisbon as industrial archaeological heritage. For this reason, in 1986 it was classified as an Asset of Public Interest. Since 1990, the Tejo Power Station is open as the Electricity Museum.\n\nThe buildings built in 1909, and which no longer exist, comprised the original Tejo Power Station, which remained operational until 1921. It was designed and projected by engineer Lucien Neu, and construction was undertaken by the company Vieillard & Touzet (the latter, Fernand Touzet, a disciple of Gustave Eiffel).\n\nFor years, the machinery was altered in order to increase the plant's output, and in 1912, when all the equipment was installed, the plant had fifteen small Belleville boilers and five generating sets with a 7,75MW output. From 1916 until being deactivated in 1921, it received steam from the new boilers installed in the current low pressure building, and was shut down, dismantled and used as storage space and workshops from that time until 1938, when it was demolished to make room for construction of the high pressure boiler building.\n\nThe low pressure naves began construction in 1914 and were completed in 1930, going through three very important construction phases. The first (from 1914 to 1921) included construction of two industrial naves for the boilers, the machinery room for the alternators and for the substation.\nThe second phase (from 1924 to 1928) included the first expansion of the boiler room with a new longitudinal nave, the purchase of a new generating set, construction of a coal distributor and the docks to the refrigeration circuit's channels.\nFinally, it was in the third phase (from 1928 to 1930) that the final expansion was carried out on the boiler room–with a new industrial nave of greater proportions than the previous ones–the machinery room and the substation.\n\nThus, in the 1930s, the plant's boiler room included eleven low pressure boilers: ten Babcock & Wilcox and one Humboldt. The machinery room comprised five generating sets of varying outputs and brands: Escher & Wiss, AEG (two sets), Stal-Asea and Escher Wiss/Thompson.\n\nWith the increased output from the two new AEG turbo-alternator sets installed in 1934, it was necessary to install new boilers that would operate with high pressure steam. Construction was carried out on property previously occupied by the original Tejo Power Station, which was demolished in 1938 to make way for construction of this new high pressure boiler building, the facility's most impressive structure. Inside, it housed three large Babcock & Wilcox high pressure boilers, which began operating in 1941.\n\nWith the destruction of the original Tejo Power Station and the installation of the high pressure boiler building, the need arose for space for workshops and storage space. Thus the CRGE purchased the properties adjoining the eastern side of the complex, where the old Senna Sugar Estates, Ltd. sugar refinery–owned by the \"Companhia de Açúcar de Moçambique\" (Mozambique Sugar Company) –used to operate. It was also necessary to create an auxiliary room for water treatment, which was installed inside the low pressure boiler building, thus dismantling the first two boilers.\n\nIn 1950 the high pressure boiler building was expanded to include another boiler, which began operating the following year and constituted the plant's final expansion.\n\nWith the entry into force in 1944 of Law 2002 – the National Electrification Law, which made producing hydroelectric power an absolute priority, the Tejo Power Station took on a secondary role in the electricity sector due to the construction of the first major hydroelectric station, the Castelo do Bode dam, which began operating in 1951, gradually turning the Tejo Power Station into a reserve station.\n\nNonetheless, the Tejo Power Station operated without interruption between 1951 and 1968, except for in 1961. In 1972, as follow-up to an attempt against the Salazar regime, high voltage lines carrying electric power to Lisbon from the Castelo do Bode hydroelectric station were pulled down, and the Tejo Power Station was once again reactivated, producing electricity for the last time in its history. It was officially shut down in 1975.\n\nAfter closing and nationalising the electric companies, it was decided that this old thermoelectric power station should be given new life and reopened for cultural purposes. The first team responsible for the Museum was formed in 1986, and in 1990 it opened its doors to the general public.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2005, the Museum underwent profound restructuring, from the entire architectural heritage to the museographic content. Finally, in 2006 the museum reopened its doors, but with a new type of museology which was much more educational and dynamic.\n\nAfter continuous transformations and expansions over the years, the Tejo Power Station's architectural ensemble represents the masterful conservation of a large manufacturing structure from the first half of the 20th century.\nThe entire set of buildings is in perfect aesthetic harmony thanks to the use of an iron structure covered in brick on all the structures. Despite this, there are differences in style between the low pressure naves and the high pressure building.\n\nThe operating principle of a thermoelectric power station is based on the burning of fuel to produce vapour which then turns an electric current generator. In theory, this is simple to carry out, but in practice it requires a complex combination of machines, circuits and logistics.\n\nAt the Tejo Power Station, the main fuel was coal, which arrived by river and was unloaded into the square with the same name in order to then be deposited in the crusher and sent to the mixing silos. From there, the coal was fed onto the conveyor belt running along the top of the building, and dropped onto the combustion belt inside the furnace. There it was burnt at a temperature of approximately 1200 °C.\nThe heat thereby generated would turn the water passing through the boiler's inner tubes into steam, which was then carried to the turbo-alternators. The water used here travelled in a closed circuit and was chemically pure. For this, it went through a purification and filtering process to avoid deteriorating the station's equipment.\n\nThus, the steam would travel in the tubes at high pressure (38 kg/cm²) to the generating sets, where the turbine would transform the steam's thermal energy into mechanical energy, and the alternator would transform the mechanical energy it received from the turbine into electric power, producing a 10.500 V triphasic electric current with a 50 Hz frequency, which after passing through the plant's substation, was distributed among consumers.\n\nIn turn, after running the turbines, the steam was sent to the condensers where it was turned back into water in order to be reused in the boilers. The hot steam returned to its liquid state through contact with the cold walls of the condenser's inner tubes, which carried water from the Tagus river. For that reason, the river water never came into direct contact with the purified water used as work fluid. From the condenser, the water was pumped back to the boilers, thereby closing the cycle.\n\nThe plant's operation would have been impossible without the people who worked there for generations. It was necessary to have a strict division of tasks and a shift work system in order to guarantee the station operated without interruption.\nThe close to five hundred workers who laboured all day and night fulfilled more than forty-five different roles. Those jobs ranged from coal unloaders to the most specialised engineers and technicians, with workers in the boiler rooms and carpentry and ironwork workshops in between.\n\nThe hardest jobs were those involving coal burning, both in the boiler room and in the boiler dust (ash) room, with workers having to endure extremely high temperatures due to the coal burning inside the boilers, the dust originating from combustion and the deafening noise throughout the entire work shift. Even so, it was the boiler room that occupied the largest number of workers and had the greatest number of different tasks. It was here that the chief technical Engineer, technical engineers, head operators, sub-head operators, operators, stokers and workers (boiler dust extraction), all endured extremely harsh working conditions, especially the latter.\n\nThe Tejo Power Station has huge heritage value, not only in architectural or archaeological terms, but also from a historic, social, anthropological and economic perspective.\nThe heritage left behind throughout the power station's activity is undeniable. It was the main power station in Lisbon and Portugal until the mid-20th century. Its reach covered the entire city and the Tagus Valley, lighting up streets and homes and providing factories with power. Without the Tejo Power Station, Lisbon's history would have been very different. It was the invisible factor in the city's growth and expansion in the 20th century, the cornerstone for regional industrialisation and the first electrified railway line in the country (Lisbon – Cascais).\n\nAt the same time, the Tejo Power Station was crucial to Lisbon's modernisation. Several generations worked and suffered by the boilers so that others could turn on the lights in their homes, walk through artificially lit streets at night, or travel comfortably in electric trams that climbed Lisbon's precipitous slopes.\nAside from that, within the station's complex, there is also a set of assets that, by remaining intact, made this old thermoelectric power plant survive the deindustrialisation of the Belém district, thus making it unique in the country and perhaps all of Europe.\n\n\n\n"}

It began as a political term, and came to be used elsewhere.\nIn law and politics, treating is the act of serving food, drink, and other refreshments to influence people for political gain, often shortly before an election. In various countries, treating is considered a form of corruption, and is illegal as such. However, as long as the supplying of refreshments is not part of a \"quid pro quo\" for votes, etc., it is often not illegal.\n\nIn a social context, treating came about with the birth of leisure time in the late nineteenth century. Young working class women took pride in going out and enjoying the city’s “cheap amusements”. Some notable cheap amusements included public dances, amusement parks, and nickelodeon movie theatres. \nAlthough young working class women liked to go out, this often proved difficult, as their wages were very low. Young women dealt with this issue in numerous ways. Some refrained from going out or limited going out to special occasions, while others depended on their male counterparts to finance their pleasures. The latter solution is referred to as “treating”. Historian Kathy Peiss has popularized this term in many of her scholarly works such as \"Cheap Amusements: Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York\" (1986) and “Charity Girls and City Pleasures” (2004). \nThe act of treating was an exchange between a man and a woman. A man would agree to pay for a woman’s outing in exchange for her company. Treating ranged from the more innocent to the more scandalous. Treating was seen as harmless when it was conducted between a “steady” couple and more risqué when it was performed on a casual basis. \nThe women who engaged with this more risqué form of treating often reciprocated by performing sexual favors. These favors could be dancing, hugging, and kissing to intercourse. The women who engaged with the more intense sexual acts were referred to as “charity girls”. These women did not see themselves as prostitutes but often walked a fine line between being treated and being paid for their sexual services.\n\n"}
{"id": "32435", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32435", "title": "Vellum", "text": "Vellum\n\nVellum is prepared animal skin or \"membrane\" used as a material for writing on. The term is derived from the Latin word \"vitulinum\" meaning \"made from calf\", leading to Old French \"velin\" for \"calfskin\". Parchment is another term for this material category. If vellum is distinguished, it is by vellum being made from calf skin, as opposed to that from other animals, or otherwise being of higher quality. Vellum is prepared as a surface for writing (or printing) to produce scrolls, single pages, codices or books. \n\nModern scholars and custodians increasingly use only the safe, if confusing, term \"membrane\". Depending on factors such as the method of preparation it may be very hard to determine the animal species involved (let alone its age) without using a laboratory, and the term avoids the need to distinguish between vellum and parchment.\n\nVellum is generally smooth and durable, although there are great variations depending on preparation and the quality of the skin. The manufacture involves the cleaning, bleaching, stretching on a frame (a \"herse\"), and scraping of the skin with a crescent-shaped knife (a \"lunarium\" or \"lunellum\"). To create tension, scraping is alternated with wetting and drying. A final finish may be achieved by abrading the surface with pumice, and treating with a preparation of lime or chalk to make it accept writing or printing ink.\n\nModern \"paper vellum\" is a made of synthetic plant material, and is called such for its usage and quality similarities. Paper vellum is used for a variety of purposes including tracing, technical drawings, plans and blueprints.\n\nIn Europe, from Roman times, the term \"vellum\" was used for the best quality of prepared skin, regardless of the animal from which the hide was obtained, calf, sheep, and goat all being commonly used (other animals, including pig, deer, donkey, horse, or camel have been used). Although the term derives from the French for \"calf\", animal vellum can include hide from virtually any other mammal. The best quality, \"uterine vellum\", was said to be made from the skins of stillborn or unborn animals, although the term was also applied to fine quality skins made from young animals. There has long been, however, much blurring of the boundaries between these terms. In 1519, William Horman could write in his \"Vulgaria\": \"That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called parchement, somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan.\" Writing in 1936, Lee Ustick explained that:\nFrench sources, closer to the original etymology, tend to define \"velin\" as from calf only, while the British Standards Institution defines parchment as made from the split skin of several species, and vellum from the unsplit skin. In the usage of modern practitioners of the artistic crafts of writing, illuminating, lettering, and bookbinding, \"vellum\" is normally reserved for calfskin, while any other skin is called \"parchment\".\n\nVellum is a translucent material produced from the skin, often split, of a young animal. The skin is washed with water and lime (Calcium hydroxide), but not together. It is then soaked in lime for several days to soften and remove the hair. \nOnce clear, the two sides of the skin are distinct: the side facing inside the animal and the hair side. The \"inside body side\" of the skin is usually the lighter and more refined of the two. The hair follicles may be visible on the outer side, together with any scarring made while the animal was alive. The membrane can also show the pattern of the animal's vein network called the \"veining\" of the sheet.\n\nAny remaining hair is removed (\"scudding\") and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame (a \"herse\"). The skin is attached at points around the circumference with cords; to prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin to which the cord is to be attached around a pebble (a \"pippin\"). The maker then uses a crescent shaped knife, (a \"lunarium\" or \"lunellum\"), to clean off any remaining hairs.\n\nOnce the skin is completely dry, it is thoroughly cleaned and processed into sheets. The number of sheets extracted from the piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the given dimensions requested by the order. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when it is folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a bifolium. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers. The membrane is then rubbed with a round, flat object (\"pouncing\") to ensure that the ink would adhere well.\n\nOnce the vellum is prepared, traditionally a quire is formed of a group of several sheets. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in their \"Introduction to Manuscript Studies\", that \"the quire was the scribe's basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages\". Guidelines are then made on the membrane. They note \"'pricking' is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of its ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns\".\n\nMost of the finer sort of medieval manuscripts, whether illuminated or not, were written on vellum. Some Gandharan Buddhist texts were written on vellum, and all Sifrei Torah (Hebrew: ספר תורה Sefer Torah; plural: ספרי תורה, Sifrei Torah) are written on kosher klaf or vellum.\n\nA quarter of the 180 copy edition of Johannes Gutenberg's first Bible printed in 1455 with movable type was also printed on vellum, presumably because his market expected this for a high-quality book. Paper was used for most book-printing, as it was cheaper and easier to process through a printing press and bind.\n\nIn art, vellum was used for paintings, especially if they needed to be sent long distances, before canvas became widely used in about 1500, and continued to be used for drawings, and watercolours. Old master prints were sometimes printed on vellum, especially for presentation copies, until at least the seventeenth century.\n\nLimp vellum or limp-parchment bindings were used frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries, and were sometimes gilt but were also often not embellished. In later centuries vellum has been more commonly used like leather, that is, as the covering for stiff board bindings. Vellum can be stained virtually any color but seldom is, as a great part of its beauty and appeal rests in its faint grain and hair markings, as well as its warmth and simplicity.\n\nLasting in excess of 1,000 years—Gregory the Great, Pastoral Care (Troyes, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS 504), for example dates from about 600 and is in excellent condition—animal vellum can be far more durable than paper. For this reason, many important documents are written on animal vellum, such as diplomas. Referring to a diploma as a \"sheepskin\" alludes to the time when diplomas were written on vellum made from animal hides.\n\nBritish Acts of Parliament are still printed on vellum for archival purposes, as are those of the Republic of Ireland. In February 2016, the UK House of Lords announced that legislation would be printed on archive paper instead of the traditional vellum from April 2016. However, Cabinet Office Minister Matthew Hancock intervened by agreeing to fund the continued use of vellum from the Cabinet Office budget.\n\nToday, because of low demand and complicated manufacturing process, animal vellum is expensive and hard to find. The only UK company still producing traditional parchment and vellum is William Cowley (established 1870), which is based in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire. A modern imitation is made of cotton. Known as paper vellum, this material is considerably cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and drafting supply stores. Some brands of writing paper and other sorts of paper use the term \"vellum\" to suggest quality.\n\nVellum is still used for Jewish scrolls, of the Torah in particular, for luxury book-binding, memorial books, and for various documents in calligraphy. It is also used on instruments such as the banjo and the bodhran, although synthetic skins are also available for these instruments.\n\nModern imitation vellum is made from plasticized rag cotton or fibers from interior tree bark. Terms include: paper vellum, Japanese vellum, and vegetable vellum. Paper vellum is usually translucent and its various sizes are often used in applications where tracing is required, such as architectural plans. It is more dimensionally stable than a linen or paper sheet, which is frequently critical in the development of large scaled drawings such as blueprints. Paper vellum had also become extremely important in hand or chemical reproduction technology for dissemination of plan copies. Like a high-quality traditional vellum, paper vellum could be produced thin enough to be virtually transparent to strong light, enabling a source drawing to be used directly in the reproduction of field-used drawings.\n\nVellum is ideally stored in a stable environment with constant temperature and 30% (± 5%) relative humidity. If vellum is stored in an environment with less than 11% relative humidity, it becomes fragile, brittle, and susceptible to mechanical stresses; if it is stored in an environment with greater than 40% relative humidity, it becomes vulnerable to gelation and to mold or fungus growth. The optimal temperature for the preservation of vellum is .\n\n\n\n"}

Discovered by the French Institute in 1928, the will outlines the division of assets by an Egyptian mother among her children.\n\nThe will of Naunakhte papyrus was originally separated into two rolls. Later on, it was discovered that the rolls were cut from the same papyrus; it was decided then to physically rejoin them (Černý 1954 pg. 29). The papyrus measures in height and in length (Černý 1945 pg. 30).\n\nHandwriting changes provide evidence that the will was written by two different scribes. It is believed that two scribes wrote different sections (Černý 1945 pg. 31).\n\nThe papyrus is now located at the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford University and can be found under P.Ashmolean 1945.97 (Haring 2003 p. 265).\n\nThe Lady Naunakhte held the title of \"citoyenne\" (citizen). This was indicative of all free women in the 20th dynasty who were not servants or slaves (Černý 1945 pg. 44).\n\nShe was married twice, first to the scribe Kenhikhopshef and then to the workman Khaemnun. The eight children mentioned in the will belonged to Khaemnun (McDowell 1999 pg. 38).\n\nThe will of Naunakhte lays out her wishes on the inheritance of her eight children.\n\nThe will first states the date of its declaration and the names of witnesses who were present when it was transcribed.\n\nThe will then states which children would receive Naunakhte'a property and which children got nothing. She disinherited three children and bestowed her property on the remaining five. Her son, Kenhikhopshef, received a special reward of a bronze washing bowl. Naunakhte specifically stated that the disinherited children were still eligible to receive property from their father, Khaemnun.\n\nThe will of Naunakhte offers an insight into the judicial proceedings that affected everyday Egyptians, particularly those of the workmen and their families at Deir el-Medina. The will also demonstrates the growing use of written records for non-royal Egyptians.\n\nThe will also illuminates the place that women held within Egyptian society. Under the 20th dynasty of Egypt, women had the same legal property ownership rights as men. Though women tended to inherit little from their families, they controlled their inheritance, not their husbands (McDowell 1999 pg. 40). The will also gives insight into the practices of caring for elder parents and the social rules that governed their support.\n\n\nAccording to the papyrus, of the children of Lady Naunakhte and her second husband, Khaemnun, the first five were considered the “good” children who continued to support and provide care to Naunakhte in her old age and therefore received a portion of her property. In contrast, Neferhot[e]p, Henshene, and Khanub failed to support Naunakhte sufficiently and therefore were disowned and left with nothing (Černý 1945 pg. 48).\n\nFirst studied and analyzed by Jaroslav Černý, the will of Naunakhte is often cited in regards to women in Egypt, judicial literature, and life within the workmen's village of Deir el-Medina. For example, A.G. McDowell cites the will of Naunakhte as an example of the power that women held in regards to controlling their own property (McDowell 1999 pg. 40). Also Ben Haring utilizes the will of Naunakhte in order to describe the growing use of papyri to record both private and judicial matters (Haring 2003 pg. 265).\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16123988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16123988", "title": "Wolfgang von Kempelen's speaking machine", "text": "Wolfgang von Kempelen's speaking machine\n\nWolfgang von Kempelen's speaking machine is a manually operated speech synthesizer that began development in 1769, by Austro-Hungarian author and inventor Wolfgang von Kempelen. It was in this same year that he completed his far more infamous contribution to history: The Turk, a chess-playing automaton, later revealed to be a very far-reaching and elaborate hoax due to the chess-playing human-being occupying its innards. But while the Turk's construction was completed in six months, Kempelen's speaking machine occupied the next twenty years of his life. After two conceptual \"dead ends\" over the first five years of research, Kempelen's third direction ultimately led him to the design he felt comfortable deeming \"final\": a functional representational model of the human vocal tract.\n\nKempelen's first experiment with speech synthesis involved only the most rudimentary elements of the vocal tract necessary to produce speech-like sounds. A kitchen bellows, used to stoke fires in wood-burning stoves, was invoked as a set of lungs to supply the airflow. A reed extracted from a common bagpipe was implemented as the glottis, the source of the raw fundamental sound in the vocal tract. The bell of a clarinet made for a sufficient mouth, despite its rigid form. This basic model was able to produce simple vowel sounds only, though some additional articulation was possible by positioning one's hand at the bell opening to obstruct airflow. The physical hardware for constructing the nasals, plosives and fricatives that most consonants require was not present, however. Kempelen, like many other early pioneers of phonetics, misunderstood the source of the perceived \"higher frequencies\" of certain sounds as a function of the glottis, rather than as the function of the formants of the entire vocal tract, so he abandoned his single-reed design for a multiple-reed approach.\n\nThe second design involved a console, similar to that of a musical organ of the period, in which the operator manned a set of keys, one for each letter. The sounds were produced by a common bellows that fed air through various pipes with the appropriate shapes and obstructions needed to produce that letter. Through experimentation, he came to find that the reed's resonant length was not crucial to the creation of the high-frequency components of certain vowels and fricatives, so he tuned them all to be the same pitch for the sake of consistency between letters. While not all letters were represented at this point, Kempelen had developed the technology required to produce most vowels and several consonants, including the plosive \"p”, and the nasal \"m”, and thus was in a position to begin forming syllables and short words. However, this immediately led to the primary flaw of his second design: the parallel nature of the multiple reeds allowed for more than one letter to be sounded at a time. And in the process of building syllables and words, the sonic “overlap” (now referred to as co-articulation) rendered sounds very uncharacteristic of human speech, undermining the intention of the design altogether. Kempelen comments:\n\nThe third approach followed a similar design to the first, which was conceptually more faithful to the natural design of the human vocal tract than the second. It consisted, like before, of a bellows, a reed and a simulated mouth (this time made of India rubber, for better creation of vowel sounds via manipulation by hand), but also included a \"throat\" to which a \"nasal cavity\" was attached (complete with two \"nostrils\" for making the \"n” and \"m” sounds), as well as several levers and tubes dedicated to \"s” and \"sh\" sounds, a rod that would interfere with the reeds vibration to make a rolling \"r” sound, and a separate, smaller bellows that would allow air to pass the reed while the mouth was completely closed (a feature required for the \"b” sound). At one point, a special valve intended to simulate the \"f” fricative was included, but was later removed when it was revealed that the same sound could be achieved by simply closing all of the orifices of the machine and allowing air to leak from the cracks. Similarly, at one point in the design, there was an alternate \"mouth\" assembly consisting of a wooden box with a pair of hinged shutters that acted as lips. Inside the box resided a hinged, wooden, string-operated flap that acted as a tongue. The purpose of this assembly was to mimic the mouth and tongue in the construction of plosives such as \"b” and \"d”, but was later removed when Kempelen recognized that without a proper tongue, the machine would never be able to produce the \"t”, \"k”, \"d” and \"g” sounds. He found his way around this entire problem by replacing the \"t” and \"k” sounds with the \"p” sound, and the \"d” and \"g” sounds with the \"b” sound (which itself was simply a slight variation of the \"p” sound). In the context of a familiar word, listeners often ignored the mispronunciation altogether (a phenomenon later explored by researchers in the field of cognitive science). Kempelen believed that people were more forgiving of the errors made by his machine due to the frequency of the reed and vocal tract resonant length he chose to use, which create a resonance much more like a young child, than that of an adult.\n\nShortly after the completion and exhibition of his Speaking Machine, in 1804, von Kempelen died, though not before publishing an extremely comprehensive journal of the past twenty years of his research in phonetics. The 456-page book, titled \"Mechanismus der menschlichen Sprache nebst Beschreibung einer sprechenden Maschine\" (which translates to \"The Mechanism of Human Speech, with a Description of a Speaking Machine\", published in 1791), contained every technical aspect of both Kempelen's construction of the Speaking Machine (including the preliminary designs) and his studies of the human vocal tract.\n\nIn 1837, Sir Charles Wheatstone resurrected the work of Wolfgang von Kempelen, creating an improved replica of his Speaking Machine. Using new technology developed over the previous 50 years, Wheatstone was able to further analyze and synthesize components of acoustic speech, giving rise to the second wave of scientific interest in phonetics. After viewing Wheatstone's improved replica of the Speaking Machine at an exposition, a young Alexander Graham Bell set out to construct his own speaking machine with the help and encouragement of his father. Bell's experiments and research ultimately led to his invention of the telephone in 1876, which revolutionized global communication.\n\nIn 1968, Marcel van den Broecke (University of Amsterdam) built a replica as part of a MA thesis, about which he reported in \"Sound Structures\", Marcel van den Broecke, Vincent van Heuven and Wim Zonneveld (eds.), chapter 2, p 9-19: \"Wolfgang von Kempelen's Speaking Machine as a Performer\", Foris Publications, Dordrecht-Netherlands/Cinnaminson-USA, 1983.\nAcoustic predictions using N-tube approximations of the vocal tract and applying them to the replica's characteristics showed what had already been established perceptually, namely that the machine could only produce two vowel-like sounds, viz. an /a/-like vowel and an /o/-like vowel. Of the consonants produced, the general purpose plosive is very convincing. A general purpose nasal can also easily be identified, but sibilants and the rattling /r/ are as unpleasant as eye witness von Windisch reported two centuries earlier.\n\n\n"}
