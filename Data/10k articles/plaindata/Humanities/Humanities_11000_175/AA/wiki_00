{"id": "30836189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30836189", "title": "Accidental gap", "text": "Accidental gap\n\nIn linguistics an accidental gap, also known as a gap, accidental lexical gap, lexical gap, lacuna, or hole in the pattern, is a word or other form that does not exist in some language but which would be permitted by the grammatical rules of the language. Accidental gaps differ from systematic gaps, those words or other forms which do not exist in a language due to the boundaries set by phonological, morphological, and other rules of that specific language.\n\nIn English, for example, a word pronounced cannot exist because it has no vowels and therefore does not obey the word-formation rules of English. This is a systematic gap. In contrast, a word pronounced would obey English word-formation rules, but this is not a word in English. Although theoretically such a word could exist, it does not; its absence is therefore an accidental gap.\n\nVarious types of accidental gaps exist. Phonological gaps are either words allowed by the phonological system of a language which do not actually exist, or sound contrasts missing from one paradigm of the phonological system itself. Morphological gaps are non-existent words potentially allowed by the morphological system. A semantic gap refers to the non-existence of a word to describe a difference in meaning seen in other sets of words within the language.\n\nOften words that are allowed in the phonological system of a language are absent. For example, in English the consonant cluster is allowed at the beginning of words such as \"spread\" or \"spring\" and the syllable rime occurs in words such as \"sick\" or \"flicker\". Even so, there is no English word pronounced *. Although this potential word is phonologically well-formed according to English phonotactics, it happens to not exist.\n\nThe term \"phonological gap\" is also used to refer to the absence of a phonemic contrast in part of the phonological system. For example, Thai has several sets of stop consonants that differ in terms of voicing (whether or not the vocal cords vibrate) and aspiration (whether a puff of air is released). Yet the language has no voiced velar consonant (). This lack of an expected distinction is commonly called a \"hole in the pattern\".\n\nA morphological gap is the absence of a word that could exist given the morphological rules of a language, including its affixes. For example, in English a deverbal noun can be formed by adding either the suffix \"-al\" or \"-(t)ion\" to certain verbs (typically words from Latin through Anglo-Norman French or Old French). Some verbs, such as \"recite\" have two related nouns, \"recital\" and \"recitation\". However, in many cases there is only one such noun, as illustrated in the chart below. Although in principle the morphological rules of English allow for other nouns, those words do not exist.\nMany potential words that could be made following morphological rules of a language do not enter the lexicon. \"Homonymy blocking\" and \"synonymy blocking\" stop some potential words. A homonym of an existing word may be blocked. For example, the word \"liver\" meaning \"someone who lives\" is not used because the word \"liver\" (an internal organ) already exists. Likewise, a potential word can be blocked if it is a synonym of an existing word. An older, more common word blocks a potential synonym, known as \"token-blocking\". For example, the word \"stealer\" (\"someone who steals\") remains only a potential word because the word \"thief\" already exists. Not only individual words, but entire word formation processes may be blocked. For example, the suffix \"-ness\" is used to form nouns from adjectives. This productive word-formation pattern blocks many potential nouns that could be formed with \"-ity\". Nouns such as *\"calmity\" (a potential synonym of \"calmness\") and *\"darkity\" (cf. \"darkness\") are unused potential words. This is known as \"type-blocking\".\n\nA defective verb is a verb that lacks some grammatical conjugation. For example, several verbs in Russian do not have a first-person singular form in non-past tense. Although most verbs have such a form (e.g. \"vožu\" \"I lead\"), about 100 verbs in the second conjugation pattern (e.g. *\"derz'u\" \"I talk rudely\"; the asterisk indicates ungrammaticality) do not appear as first-person singular in the present-future tense. Morris Halle called this defective verb paradigm an example of an accidental gap.\n\nThe similar case of unpaired words occurs where one word is obsolete or rare while another word derived from it is more common. Examples include *\"effable\" and \"ineffable\" or *\"kempt\" and \"unkempt\".\n\nA gap in semantics occurs when a particular meaning distinction visible elsewhere in the lexicon is absent. For example, English words describing family members generally show gender distinction. Yet the English word \"cousin\" can refer to either a male or female cousin. Similarly, while there are general terms for siblings and parents, there is no comparable common gender-neutral term for a parent's sibling or a sibling's child. The separate words predicted on the basis of this semantic contrast are absent from the language, or at least from many speakers' dialects.\n"}

It corresponds to Middle Coles Creek, chronologically between the \"Bayland Phase\" and \"Kings Crossing Phase\".\n\nThe Aden Site is located on the south bank of Jeff Davis Bayou, a mile and a half east of the unincorporated community of Valley Park, Issaquena County, Mississippi, U.S.A., near coordinates .\n\nThe site consists of three platform mounds making a triangular arrangement surrounding a small plaza, with the fourth side of the plaza bordered by Jeff Davis Bayou. This is considered to be a typical Coles Creek phase settlement pattern. The largest, designated Mound A, on the eastern border of the plaza is in height, with the summit surface area measuring by . The second largest mound, Mound B on the southern border of the plaza, is high, and measuring by at its base. Mound C, located on the western border of the plaza, is high and in diameter. Mound C has been heavily degraded by cultivation, and may have been larger.\n\nAden Phase (800-900 CE) is a classification of sites and artifacts of the Cole Creek Culture created by Phillip Phillips.\n\nAden Phase sites are distributed throughout western Mississippi, in the area east of the Mississippi River and North of the Yazoo River except for the Blackely and Haynes Bluff sites which are along the Southern bank of the Yazoo River.\n\nThe original Cole Creek site had become better known as the Gordon site and was considered an example of the late Gordon period of the Plaquemine culture. Sites such as Greenhouse and French Fork showed evidence of multiple occupations over a long period resulting in pottery that from multiple cultures. The Aden Phase was an attempt to create a new baseline for “classic” Cole Creek Culture which could be then be used as a reference when comparing it to other cultures.\n\nAden Phase sites are distributed throughout western Mississippi, in the area east of the Mississippi River and North of the Yazoo River except for the Blackely and Haynes Bluff sites which are along the Southern bank of the Yazoo River.\n\nThe Aden Phase was originally represented by the pottery styles identified as Baytown Plain, var. Valley Park; Chevalier Stamped, var Chevalier; Coles Creek Incised, vars. Coles and Wade; Evansville Punctuated, var. Rhinehart; French Fork Incised, var. Larkin ; Marzique Incised, var. Marzique; and Mulberry Creek Cord Marked, var. Smith Creek. The sites now considered the best examples of “typical” Aden Phase are, in descending order of importance Coles Creek Incised, vars. Coles Creek, Campbellsville, and Macedonia, and French Fork Incised, var Larkin.\n\nPottery of the Aden Phase tended towards simple designs; regular shapes, unmodified rims and few appendages. Their surfaces were typically light gray, clouded by firing and bits of white material embedded in the earthenware. Triangular, zig zag and crescents were also present as decoration.\n\nAden Phase settlements were the first example of the rectangular shaped mounds that have become a hallmark of Cole Creek Culture settlements, though some sites have older conical mounds from the Bayland phase remained in sites that were continually inhabited since that time. In the Aden Phase, settlements began to be built in a planned fashion with three rectangular mounds of approximately equal size forming a ceremonial center to the town with the three mounds forming three sides of a rectangular space.\n\n"}

{"id": "3556316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3556316", "title": "Apples and oranges", "text": "Apples and oranges\n\nA comparison of apples and oranges occurs when two items or groups of items are compared that cannot be practically compared.\n\nThe idiom, \"comparing apples and oranges\", refers to the apparent differences between items which are popularly thought to be incomparable or incommensurable, such as apples and oranges. The idiom may also be used to indicate that a false analogy has been made between two items, such as where an \"apple\" is faulted for not being a good \"orange\".\n\nThe idiom is not unique to English. In Quebec French, it may take the form \"comparer des pommes avec des oranges\" (to compare apples and oranges), while in European French the idiom says \"comparer des pommes et des poires\" (to compare apples and pears). In Latin American Spanish, it is usually \"comparar papas y boniatos\" (comparing potatoes and sweet potatoes) or commonly for all varieties of Spanish \"comparar peras con manzanas\" (comparing pears and apples). In some other languages the term for 'orange' derives from 'apple', suggesting not only that a direct comparison between the two is possible, but that it is implicitly present in their names. Fruit other than apples and oranges can also be compared; for example, apples and pears are compared in Danish, Dutch, German, Spanish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Italian, Slovene, Luxembourgish, Serbian, and Turkish. In fact, in the Spanish-speaking world, a common idiom is \"sumar peras con manzanas\", that is, \"to add pears and apples\"; the same thing applies in Italian (\"sommare le mele con le pere\") and Romanian (\"a aduna merele cu perele\"). In Portuguese, the expression is \"comparar laranjas com bananas\" (compare orange to banana). In Czech, the idiom \"míchat jablka s hruškami\" literally means 'to mix apples and pears'.\n\nSome languages use completely different items, such as the Serbian \"Поредити бабе и жабе\" (comparing grandmothers and toads), or the Romanian \"baba şi mitraliera\" (the grandmother and the machine gun); \"vaca şi izmenele\" (the cow and the longjohns); or \"țiganul şi carioca\" (the gypsy and the marker), or the Welsh \"mor wahanol â mêl a menyn\" (as different as honey and butter), while some languages compare dissimilar properties of dissimilar items. For example, an equivalent Danish idiom, \"Hvad er højest, Rundetårn eller et tordenskrald?\" means \"What is highest, the Round Tower or a thunderclap?\", referring to the size of the former and the sound of the latter. In Russian, the phrase \"сравнивать тёплое с мягким\" (to compare warm and soft) is used. In Argentina, a common question is \"¿En qué se parecen el amor y el ojo del hacha?\" (What do love and the eye of an axe have in common?) and emphasizes dissimilarity between two subjects; in Colombia, a similar (though more rude) version is common: \"confundir la mierda con la pomada\" (to confuse shit with ointment). In Polish, the expression \"co ma piernik do wiatraka?\" is used, meaning \"What has (is) gingerbread to a windmill?\". In Chinese, a phrase that has the similar meaning is 风马牛不相及 (fēng mǎ niú bù xiāng jí), literally meaning \"horses and cattles won't mate with each other\", and later used to describe things that are totally unrelated and incomparable.\n\nA number of more exaggerated comparisons are sometimes made, in cases in which the speaker believes the two objects being compared are radically different. For example, \"oranges with orangutans\", \"apples with dishwashers\", and so on. In English, different fruits, such as pears, plums, or lemons are sometimes substituted for oranges in this context.\n\nSometimes the two words sound similar, for example, Romanian \"merele cu perele\" (apples and pears) and the Hungarian \"szezont a fazonnal\" (the season with the fashion).\n\nAt least two tongue-in-cheek scientific studies have been conducted on the subject, each of which concluded that apples can be compared with oranges fairly easily and on a low budget and the two fruits are quite similar.\n\nThe first study, conducted by Scott A. Sandford of the NASA Ames Research Center, used infrared spectroscopy to analyze both apples and oranges. The study, which was published in the satirical science magazine \"Annals of Improbable Research\", concluded: \"[...] the comparing apples and oranges defense should no longer be considered valid. This is a somewhat startling revelation. It can be anticipated to have a dramatic effect on the strategies used in arguments and discussions in the future.\"\n\nA second study, written by Stamford Hospital's surgeon-in-chief James Barone and published in the \"British Medical Journal,\" noted that the phrase \"apples and oranges\" was appearing with increasing frequency in the medical literature, with some notable articles comparing \"Desflurane and propofol\" and \"Salmeterol and ipratropium\" with \"apples and oranges\". The study also found that both apples and oranges were sweet, similar in size, weight, and shape, that both are grown in orchards, and both may be eaten, juiced, and so on. The only significant differences found were in terms of seeds (the study used seedless oranges), the involvement of Johnny Appleseed, and color.\n\nThe \"Annals of Improbable Research\" subsequently noted that the \"earlier investigation was done with more depth, more rigour, and, most importantly, more expensive equipment\" than the \"British Medical Journal\" study.\n\nOn April Fools' Day 2014, \"The Economist\" compared worldwide production of apples and oranges from 1983 to 2013, however noted them to be \"unrelated variables\".\n\nWhile references to comparing apples and oranges are often a rhetorical device, references to adding apples and oranges are made in the case of teaching students the proper uses of units. Here, the admonition not to \"add apples and oranges\" refers to the requirement that two quantities with different units may not be combined by addition, although they may always be combined in ratio form by multiplication, so that multiplying ratios of apples and oranges is allowed. Similarly, the concept of this distinction is often used metaphorically in elementary algebra.\n\nThe admonition is really more of a mnemonic, since in general counts of objects have no intrinsic unit and, for example, a number count of apples may be dimensionless or have dimension \"fruit\"; in either of these two cases, apples and oranges may indeed be added.\n\n"}

The presence of man activities in Sri Lanka probably dates from 75,000 years ago (late Pleistocene period). Prehistoric sites which are presently identified in the country are distributed from the maritime belt and the lowland plains of the wet and dry zones to the high plateaus and rain forest in the central and south western mountain region of the island. The protohistoric period expands from about 1000 BC to the historical period at about 500 BC. The main indicators of the distribution of protohistoric and early settlements in the island are the megalithic burials and pottery sites. \n\nThe beginning of the historical period of Sri Lanka is traditionally assigned to the reign of king Devanampiya Tissa (307–267 BC) when the Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka by the missionaries sent by the Indian emperor Ashoka. However the first clear information about the establishment of building and structures are dated back to the time of king Pandukabhaya (437–367 BC).\n\nSri Lanka's political and religious history is mainly set out by the ancient chronicles as well as over 4,000 stone inscriptions from 3rd century BC onward. Which give the history in considerable detail from the 3rd century and less reliably back to the 6th century BC.\n\nSri Lanka has more than 250,000 identified archaeological sites throughout the country and some of them have been declared as archaeological reserves and protected monuments by the Sri Lanka archaeological department.

Their exploits are known in part through the fictional film \"Cattle Annie and Little Britches\" (1981), directed by Lamont Johnson and starring Amanda Plummer in her film debut as Cattle Annie, with Diane Lane as Little Britches.\n\nCattle Annie and Little Britches were crack shots with both pistol and rifle, but today they are mostly unknown outside of the film. Yet they were once among the most recognized names among outlaws in the Oklahoma and Indian territories, where they carried out their short-lived criminal ventures.\n\nAnna was born in Lawrence in Douglas County in eastern Kansas, one of eight children of James C. and Rebekah McDoulet. When Anna was four years old, the family moved to Coyville in Wilson County, in southeastern Kansas. Anna worked as a hotel dishwasher and performed other odd jobs. When she was twelve, the family moved to the Otoe Reservation near Skiatook north of Tulsa in the northern Oklahoma Territory, where she turned outlaw. Annie and Little Britches followed tales of the Bill Doolin gang from reading dime novelists like Ned Buntline, who became famous for his mostly fictional account of Buffalo Bill Cody as a western frontier hero and showman.\n\nFor two years, Cattle Annie and Little Britches roamed the former Indian Territory, often working together and at other times alone. They stole horses, sold alcohol to the Osage and Pawnee Indians, and warned outlaw gangs whenever law-enforcement officers were nearby. They wore men's clothing and packed pistols on their hips. Their adventures netted headlines from Guthrie, the capital of the former Oklahoma Territory, to Coffeyville in southeastern Kansas, where the Dalton gang attempted to rob two banks simultaneously on October 5, 1892.\n\nU.S. Marshal Steve Burke captured 13-year-old Cattle Annie climbing from a window in 1895. (Marshal Bill Tilghman had a more difficult task apprehending Little Britches, who engaged in a physical confrontation with the famous lawman before he took her into custody.) Annie was sentenced to one year in the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Framingham. Because of health issues, she was soon paroled. She remained in Framingham for some time, having informed corrections officers that, if she returned to Oklahoma, she would likely have fallen back into her criminal ways. In 1898, she was working as a housekeeper for Mrs. Mary Daniels in Sherborn in Middlesex County south of Framingham. A few months later, she may have moved to New York City, where she may have died of tuberculosis.\n\nAnother legitimate report claims that Annie left Framingham to return to Oklahoma where she wed Earl Frost of Perry on March 13, 1901. The couple had two sons, Robert C. Frost (1903-1993) of Oklahoma City and Carlos D. Frost, later of Malibu, California. The Frosts divorced in Noble County, Oklahoma in October 1909, probably because Annie had joined a Wild West show. The historical museum in Guthrie maintains that, soon after the divorce from Frost, Annie married Whitmore R. Roach (1879-1947), a Texas native, veteran of World War I, and painting contractor in Oklahoma City, where they lived after 1912. They had resided from 1910 to 1912 in Fort Worth, Texas. This \"Emma McDoulet Roach\" is interred at Rose Hill Burial Park in Oklahoma City. She died in 1978, just short of her 96th birthday. Her newspaper obituary makes no mention of her early days or even the first name \"Anna\" but instead refers to \"Emma\", the shortened form of \"Emmaline\". The obituary indicates that she had been a bookkeeper in her later working career. Her services were held in her home church, Olivet Baptist in Oklahoma City.\n\nMeanwhile, Little Britches also served a short sentence at the reformatory in Framingham, but her whereabouts thereafter are unknown. Some reports indicate that Little Britches returned to Tulsa, where she was married, had a family, and led an exemplary life.\n\nJohnson's film, \"Cattle Annie and Little Britches\" (1981), features Burt Lancaster as an historically inaccurate and much older Bill Doolin, Rod Steiger as Marshal William Tilghman, Scott Glenn as Bill Dalton, and Buck Taylor, particularly known to audiences as the blacksmith-turned-deputy Newly O'Brien on CBS's \"Gunsmoke\", as the outlaw Dynamite Dick, presumably Dan Clifton, called \"Dynamite Dan.\"\n\nNovelist Robert Ward, a native of Baltimore, Maryland, penned \"Cattle Annie and Little Britches\" (1977), his personal interpretation of the romantic legends of the Doolin-Dalton gang.\n"}

It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in kinetic criminal operations.\n\nChildren may volunteer to participate in piratical activities (usually on account of socioeconomic desperation, familial suggestion or peer influence) or they may be forcibly abducted by piratical gangs.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why an adult pirate commander would view children as being of significant tactical value. These perceptions render children vulnerable to abduction or forced recruitment. As noted by Carl Conradi:\n\nIn other cases, children may volunteer to participate in piratical activities. However, as asserted by the Canada-based Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative, \"'voluntary' enlistment must be understood in terms of the limited choices and circumstances that may exist in the context of a particular country.\"’ If a child is extremely poor, has been displaced from his or her home, has been separated from his or her family, has limited educational opportunities or has been exposed to conflict, there is an increased likelihood that he or she will view piracy as a legitimate vehicle for social advancement.\n\nIn the absence of specific international legislation on juvenile maritime piracy, the precise age of a child’s criminal responsibility when committing piratical acts differs from country to country. There are, however, a number of international conventions pertaining to either maritime law or children’s rights that may provide some guidance as to the proper handling of child pirates.\n\nWhile the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS, 1982) does not discuss children’s involvement in maritime criminal activities, it does provide a clear definition of piracy. According to Article 101, piracy is:\n\nUNCLOS does recognise universal jurisdiction over the crime of piracy but it only applies to criminal acts that take place on international waters. If an act of piracy occurs within a country’s territorial waters, it is a matter of state jurisdiction and prosecution.\n\nArticle 3 of the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention (No. 182, 1999) stipulates that:\n\nInsofar as participation in any form of maritime criminality is dangerous (and indeed, potentially lethal), child piracy clearly constitutes a worst form of child labour.\n\nAccording to the Convention, a child is any person who is below the age of 18.\n\nAs of April 2013, eight countries had not signed ILO Convention No. 182. These include Cuba, Eritrea, India, the Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Palau, Somalia and Tuvalu. Two of these countries – India and Somalia – are currently detaining and prosecuting alleged child pirates.\n\nLike ILO Convention No. 182, Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1990) specifies that a child is any human being below the age of 18 years. However, the same article adds a caveat to the effect that a country’s minimum age of criminal responsibility may be lower than 18, as stipulated by national law.\n\nOther sections that may have some bearing upon the status of child pirates include Article 6, in which, “States Parties recognize that every child has the inherent right to life,” and that, “States Parties shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child.”\n\nArticle 19(1) affirms that, “States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.” This clause may be particularly relevant in cases where a child’s parents have forced him or her to participate in piratical activity, or where the State is responsible for detaining, interrogating, trying and/or incarcerating a captured child pirate.\n\nArticle 32(1) echoes ILO Convention No. 182 by stipulating that, “States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child’s education, or to be harmful to the child’s health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.”\n\nArticle 35 says that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction of, the sale of or traffic in children for any purpose or in any form.” When a piratical gang permanently separates a child from his or her family, this may constitute an act of child trafficking.\n\nArticle 37(a) affirms that, “No child shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Neither capital punishment nor life imprisonment without possibility of release shall be imposed for offences committed by persons below eighteen years of age.” Likewise, Article 37(c) states that, “Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age. In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child’s best interests not to do so and shall have the right to maintain contact with his or her family through correspondence and visits, save in exceptional circumstances.”\n\nLastly, Article 39 stipulates that, “State Parties shall take all appropriate measures to promote physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of a child victim of: any form of neglect, exploitation or abuse; torture or any other form of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or armed conflicts. Such recovery and reintegration shall take place in an environment which fosters the health, self-respect and dignity of the child.”\n\nThe third version of the \"Best Management Practices to Deter Piracy off the Coast of Somalia and in the Arabian Sea Area\" (June 2010) recommends a sample follow-up report that should be filled by the captain of any vessel that has come under pirate attack. While the report does solicit certain details concerning the offending raiding party – such as the number of constituent pirate members, their physical appearance and the weapons that were used – it does not ask for the estimated ages of pirates.\n\nThe Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP) is a multilateral pact that facilitates information sharing between signatory countries. The reporting mechanism that it establishes does not specifically call for the collection of disaggregated data pertaining to the ages of captured pirates.\n\nAccording to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the UN Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia is in the midst of drafting an apprehension and transfer protocol for juvenile pirates who are captured by international navies operating in the Horn of Africa region.\n\nAll three of the main Somali sub-regions (i.e., South-Central, Puntland and Somaliland) have signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with the governments of Mauritius and the Seychelles, allowing for the transfer of convicted pirates to prison facilities in Somalia. These MoUs, however, do not specify clear standard operating procedures for processing and/or transferring pirates who are determined to be under the age of 18. Kenya is also trying suspected Somali pirates but no prisoner transfer agreement is currently in place.\n\nAccording to UNICEF-Somalia, some 100 child pirates are currently being detained in a prison in Bosaso, Puntland. A second prison for juvenile pirates with a capacity of 100 is being built in Garoowe, while a 70-person prison for juvenile pirates is being built in Somaliland.\n\nThe Republic of Somaliland’s Juvenile Justice Law (2007) raised the age of criminal responsibility for 14 to 15 years and established separate judicial mechanisms for minors, such as child-specific courts of first instance and appellate courts. However, Somaliland’s Law on Combating Piracy (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.\n\nThe Somali sub-region of Puntland does not have any specific legislation pertaining to child protection, though as of April 2013, a policy on orphans and other vulnerable children had been tabled in Parliament.\n\nIndia’s Piracy Bill (2012) does not make any specific reference to persons under the age of 18.\n\nAccording to the Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative:\n\nOne of the most egregious instances of child maritime piracy off the coast of Somalia is recounted on the Canadian Naval Review’s Broadsides forum:\n\nThe \"Vega 5\" hijacking does not appear to be an isolated incident. The Broadsides article continues to report that:\n\nThe Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has determined that a significant proportion of those Somali pirates who are currently being tried internationally are actually under the age of 18. In India, 38 out of 61 pirates (62%) facing trial are juveniles; in Germany, 3 out of 10 (30%) are children; and in the United States of America, all three Somali pirates currently facing trial are under the age of 18.\n\nThe Roméo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative has noted that:\n"}

Cultural districts may be seen by local authorities as a way to revitalize the “brownfields” of the urban core: areas of abandoned buildings that encourage businesses and residents to leave the cities.\n\nThe developing theory of cultural districts increasingly conceives them as development models for local systems, where the term ‘district’ refers to supra-urban area. At supra-urban or regional level the complexity of a cultural district is even more marked than at urban level, due to potential interdependencies among a greater multitude of actors. A useful approach towards a deeper understanding can be to conceive cultural districts as complex adaptive systems. Indeed, complexity is definitely not a management fad and fashion, a mere metaphor or methodology, but a deeper perception of reality. Organizations are classically seen as purpose-driven entities with a structural form, exhibiting a certain degree of order and determinism. Such a linear top-down approach to analysis and design, however, exhibits many limitations when used for organizational settings characterized by a complex web of interdependencies. The view of a cultural district as a complex adaptive system suggests new ideas and approaches for policy-makers, designers and managers. It also opens up debate on issues of organizational design and change.\n\nMore than 90 cities in the United States have planned or implemented cultural districts, positioning the arts at the center of their urban revitalization efforts.\nAll cultural districts are unique, reflecting their cities’ unique environment, including history of land use, urban growth and cultural development. There is no standard model.\nMost cultural districts are built to take advantage of other city attractions such as historic features, convention spaces and parks and other natural amenities.\n\nStructural considerations within or near the district, community leadership and social forces all influence the development of a cultural district and the type of district that results. Factors influencing the siting of cultural districts include: perceived need for urban revitalization, existing investment, property value and preexisting cultural facilities.\n\nUnlike a cultural center or a shopping mall, a cultural district comprises a large number of property owners, both public and private, who control the various properties involved, hence a structural complexity. The effectiveness of the coordinating agency in guiding the direction of the cultural district varies according to its size, budget, mandated functions and degree of authority, resulting in widespread variation in the coordinated cultural programming and administration services offered by cultural districts. The coordinated agency appointed for the district must work carefully to ensure inclusiveness of concerns and to balance potentially conflicting interests.\n\nCultural districts offer two major types of services: one targets the arts community, providing marketing /promotion, box office services and property management; the other targets the district’s business and property owners, offering urban design and development services or administrative support.\n\nThe excitement and attraction of a cultural district is a high mixture of interesting things to do, places to see, and places to visit (both cultural and noncultural), across the day and evening.\n\nSome artist-activists are promoting the concept of a \"Naturally Occurring Cultural District,\" or NOCD, patterned after the demographic concept of a naturally occurring retirement community. A NOCD \"supports existing neighborhood cultural assets rather than imposing arts institutions somewhere new,\" according to Tamara Greenfield, co-director of NOCD-New York. Co-director Caron Atlas explained: \"If a cultural district has emerged 'naturally,' then it grows from, builds on and validates existing community assets rather than importing assets from outside a community.\" Indeed, different conceptions of cultural districts include self-organization and emergence in different degrees (e.g. Lazzeretti, 2003; Le Blanc, 2010; Sacco et al., 2013; Stern & Seifert, 2007). Many authors argue that districtualization is essentially spontaneous and that the conditions for formation can be recognized and sustained, not created from the top. If the conception of a cultual district as a complex adaptive system were accepted, the design process would be conceived as something more flexible, dynamic and in evolution. Complexity theory and complex adaptive systems should move understanding of supra-urban cultural districts towards a more holistic and bottom-up approach rather than a linear top-down approach to analysis and design. This does not suggest inhibiting any attempt at prediction or planning. The use of qualitative analysis and rough estimations or agent-based modelling can represent a fertile ground for both future research, policy-making and managerial implications.\n\n"}

In the centre of the square stands a monumental statue of Germany's renowned poet Friedrich Schiller. The square was created by Johann Arnold Nering at the end of the seventeenth century as the Linden-Markt and reconstructed by Georg Christian Unger in 1773. The Gendarmenmarkt is named after the cuirassier regiment \"Gens d'Arme\"s, which had stables at the square until 1773.\n\nDuring World War II, most of the buildings were badly damaged or destroyed. Today all of them have been restored.\n\nGendarmenmarkt was first built in 1688. It was a marketplace and part of the city's Western expansion of Friedrichstadt, one of Berlin's emerging quarters.\n\nThe French Church (in German: \"Französischer Dom\", where \"Dom\" refers to the \"dome\" and not to a cathedral. Neither the French nor the German Church was ever the seat of a bishop. The terminology is a relic of francophone Frederick the Great, who was instrumental in enhancing the Gendarmenmarkt) is the older of the two churches, was built by the Huguenot community between 1701 and 1705. It was modelled after the destroyed Huguenot church in Charenton-Saint-Maurice, France. The tower and porticoes, designed by Carl von Gontard, were added to the building in 1785. The French Church has a viewing platform, a restaurant and a Huguenot museum.\n\nThe German Church (in German: \"Deutscher Dom\") is located to the south of the Gendarmenmarkt. It has a pentagonal structure and was designed by Martin Grünberg and built in 1708 by Giovanni Simonetti. This church belonged to the Lutheran community. It too was modified in 1785 by Carl von Gontard, who built the domed tower. The German Church was completely destroyed by fire in 1945, during World War II. After German reunification it was rebuilt, finished in 1993 and re-opened in 1996 as a museum of German history.\n\nThe Konzerthaus Berlin is the most recent building on the Gendarmenmarkt. It was built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel in 1821 as the \"Schauspielhaus\". It was based on the ruins of the National Theatre, which had been destroyed by fire in 1817. Parts of the building contain columns and some outside walls from the destroyed building. Like the other buildings on the square, it was also badly damaged during World War II. The reconstruction, finished in 1984, turned the theatre into a concert hall. Today, it is the home of the Konzerthausorchester Berlin.\n\nThe Gendarmenmarkt hosts one of Berlin's most popular Christmas markets.\n\n"}

{"id": "12386", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12386", "title": "Golden ratio", "text": "Golden ratio\n\nIn mathematics, two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities. The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship. The golden ratio is also called the golden mean or golden section (Latin: \"sectio aurea\"). Other names include extreme and mean ratio, medial section, divine proportion, divine section (Latin: \"sectio divina\"), golden proportion, golden cut, and golden number.\n\nMathematicians since Euclid have studied the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a regular pentagon and in a golden rectangle, which may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same aspect ratio. The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as financial markets, in some cases based on dubious fits to data. The golden ratio appears in some patterns in nature, including the spiral arrangement of leaves and other plant parts.\n\nSome twentieth-century artists and architects, including Le Corbusier and Salvador Dalí, have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the golden rectangle, in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be aesthetically pleasing.\n\nExpressed algebraically, for quantities \"a\" and \"b\" with \"a\" > \"b\" > 0,\n\nwhere the Greek letter phi (formula_2 or formula_3) represents the golden ratio.{2}</math>. The sum of the two solutions is one, and the product of the two solutions is negative one.}} It is an irrational number with a value of:\n\nThe golden ratio has a wide range of demonstrations throughout history. According to Mario Livio:\n\nAncient Greek mathematicians first studied what we now call the golden ratio because of its fundamentality to the geometry of regular pentagrams and pentagons. According to one story, 5th-century mathematician Hippasus discovered that the golden ratio was an irrational number, surprising Pythagoreans. Hippasus was also the first to write of the (golden ratio-related) dodecahedron, though its discovery is attributed to Pythagoras ( 570 BC–c. 495 BC); Theaetetus (c. 417–c. 369 BC) was the first to describe all five possible regular solids. In the \"Republic\" (c. 380 BC), Plato expressed the concept of in his Analogy of the Divided Line. Euclid in his \"Elements\" (c. 300 BC) provides several propositions and their proofs employing the golden ratio, and wrote the first known definition:\nLuca Pacioli explored the golden ratio in his book \"On the Divine Proportion\" (1509). The first known approximation of the (inverse) golden ratio by a decimal fraction was stated as \"about 0.6180340\" in 1597 by Michael Maestlin in a letter to his former student Johannes Kepler (1571–1630). Kepler proved that consecutive golden numbers approach the golden ratio asymptotically, and combined two of his favorite mathematical concepts in the triangle named for him, saying:\nGeometry has two great treasures: one is the theorem of Pythagoras, and the other the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio; the first we may compare to a measure of gold, the second we may name a precious jewel.\nCharles Bonnet (1720–1793) pointed out that in the spiral phyllotaxis of plants going clockwise and counter-clockwise were frequently two successive golden ratio series. Martin Ohm is believed to have been the first to use the term \"goldener Schnitt\" (golden section) to describe the ratio in 1835. Édouard Lucas (1842–1891) gave the golden number series the name of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nBy 1914, mathematician Mark Barr suggested Greek letter Phi (φ) as a symbol for the golden ratio. Previously, it was represented by τ (tau, the first letter of the ancient Greek root τομή—meaning \"cut\" or \"section\"). In 1974, Roger Penrose discovered Penrose tiling, a pattern set that is related to the golden ratio both in the relationship of areas of its two rhombic tiles and in their relative frequency within the pattern. This in turn led to new discoveries about quasicrystals.\n\n\"De Divina Proportione\", a three-volume work by Luca Pacioli, was published in 1509. Pacioli, a Franciscan friar, was known mostly as a mathematician, but he was also trained and keenly interested in art. \"De Divina Proportione\" explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though it is often said that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the Vitruvian system of rational proportions. Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. \"De Divina Proportione\" contains illustrations of regular solids by Leonardo da Vinci, Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.\n\nThe Parthenon's façade as well as elements of its façade are said by some to be circumscribed by golden rectangles. Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with the golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, \"It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the \"Elements\" (308 BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and decagons was duly observed, as well as in the dodecahedron\". And Keith Devlin says, \"Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one thing we know for sure is that Euclid, in his famous textbook \"Elements\", written around 300 BC, showed how to calculate its value.\" Later sources like Vitruvius exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions. One researcher concluded that the golden ratio was totally absent from Greek architecture of the classical fifth century BC, and almost absent during the following six centuries, based on measurements of 15 temples, 18 monumental tombs, 8 sarcophagi, and 58 grave stelae.\n\nIn a recent book, author Jason Elliot speculated that the golden ratio was used by the designers of the Naqsh-e Jahan Square and the adjacent Lotfollah mosque. A 2004 geometrical analysis of earlier research into the Great Mosque of Kairouan reveals a consistent application of the golden ratio throughout the design, according to Boussora and Mazouz. They found ratios close to the golden ratio in the overall proportion of the plan and in the dimensioning of the prayer space, the court, and the minaret. The authors note, however, that the areas where ratios close to the golden ratio were found are not part of the original construction, and theorize that these elements were added in a reconstruction.\n\nThe Swiss architect Le Corbusier, famous for his contributions to the modern international style, centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier's faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as \"rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned.\"\nLe Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his Modulor system for the scale of architectural proportion. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Vitruvian Man\", the work of Leon Battista Alberti, and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of architecture. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on human measurements, Fibonacci numbers, and the double unit. He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the Modulor system. Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in Garches exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.\n\nAnother Swiss architect, Mario Botta, bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in Origlio, the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci's illustrations of polyhedra in \"De divina proportione\" (\"On the Divine Proportion\") and his friendship with its author have led some to speculate that he incorporated the golden ratio in his work, but this is not supported by any of Leonardo's writings. Similarly, although the \"Vitruvian Man\" is often connected with the golden ratio, its proportions do not actually match it, and the text only mentions whole number ratios. The 16th-century philosopher Heinrich Agrippa drew a man over a pentagram inside a circle, implying a more direct relationship to the golden ratio.\n\nThe Section d'Or was a collective of painters, sculptors, poets and critics associated with Cubism and Orphism. Active from 1911 to around 1914, they adopted the name both to highlight that Cubism represented the continuation of a grand tradition, rather than being an isolated art-form, and in homage to the mathematical harmony associated with Georges Seurat. The Cubists observed in its harmonies, geometric structuring of motion and form, the primacy of idea over nature, an absolute scientific clarity of conception. However, despite this general interest in mathematical harmony, whether the paintings featured in the celebrated 1912 \"Salon de la Section d'Or\" exhibition used the golden ratio itself in their compositions is more difficult to determine. Mario Livio, for example, claims that they did not, and Marcel Duchamp said as much in an interview with art historian William A. Camfield. On the other hand, an analysis by Camfield suggests that Juan Gris made use of the golden ratio in composing works that were likely, but not definitively, shown at the exhibition. (Art historian Daniel Robbins has argued that in addition to referencing the mathematical term, the exhibition's name also refers to the earlier \"Bandeaux d'Or\" group, with which Albert Gleizes and other former members of the Abbaye de Créteil had been deeply involved.)\n\nSalvador Dalí, influenced by the works of Matila Ghyka, explicitly used the golden ratio in his masterpiece, \"The Sacrament of the Last Supper\". The dimensions of the canvas are a golden rectangle. A huge dodecahedron, in perspective so that edges appear in golden ratio to one another, is suspended above and behind Jesus and dominates the composition.\n\nMondrian has been said to have used the golden section extensively in his geometrical paintings, though other experts (including critic Yve-Alain Bois) have disputed this claim.\n\nA statistical study performed in 1999 on 565 works of art by different painters found that they did not use the golden ratio in their canvas sizes. The study concluded that the average ratio of the two sides of the paintings studied is 1.34, with averages for individual artists ranging from 1.04 to 1.46. On the other hand, Pablo Tosto listed over 350 works by well-known artists, including more than 100 which have canvasses with golden rectangle and root-5 proportions.\n\nAccording to Jan Tschichold,\nThere was a time when deviations from the truly beautiful page proportions 2:3, 1:√3, and the Golden Section were rare. Many books produced between 1550 and 1770 show these proportions exactly, to within half a millimeter.\n\nSome sources claim that the golden ratio is commonly used in everyday design, for example in the shapes of postcards, playing cards, posters, wide-screen televisions, photographs, light switch plates and cars.\nErnő Lendvai analyzes Béla Bartók's works as being based on two opposing systems, that of the golden ratio and the acoustic scale, though other music scholars reject that analysis. French composer Erik Satie used the golden ratio in several of his pieces, including \"Sonneries de la Rose+Croix\". The golden ratio is also apparent in the organization of the sections in the music of Debussy's \"Reflets dans l'eau (Reflections in Water)\", from \"Images\" (1st series, 1905), in which \"the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals 34, 21, 13 and 8, and the main climax sits at the phi position\".\n\nThe musicologist Roy Howat has observed that the formal boundaries of Debussy's \"La Mer\" correspond exactly to the golden section. Trezise finds the intrinsic evidence \"remarkable\", but cautions that no written or reported evidence suggests that Debussy consciously sought such proportions.\n\nPearl Drums positions the air vents on its Masters Premium models based on the golden ratio. The company claims that this arrangement improves bass response and has applied for a patent on this innovation.\n\nThough Heinz Bohlen proposed the non-octave-repeating 833 cents scale based on combination tones, the tuning features relations based on the golden ratio. As a musical interval the ratio 1.618... is 833.090... cents ().\n\nAdolf Zeising, whose main interests were mathematics and philosophy, found the golden ratio expressed in the arrangement of parts such as leaves and branches along the stems of plants and of veins in leaves. He extended his research to the skeletons of animals and the branchings of their veins and nerves, to the proportions of chemical compounds and the geometry of crystals, even to the use of proportion in artistic endeavors. In these patterns in nature he saw the golden ratio operating as a universal law. In connection with his scheme for golden-ratio-based human body proportions, Zeising wrote in 1854 of a universal law \"in which is contained the ground-principle of all formative striving for beauty and completeness in the realms of both nature and art, and which permeates, as a paramount spiritual ideal, all structures, forms and proportions, whether cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, acoustic or optical; which finds its fullest realization, however, in the human form.\"\n\nIn 2010, the journal \"Science\" reported that the golden ratio is present at the atomic scale in the magnetic resonance of spins in cobalt niobate crystals.\n\nSince 1991, several researchers have proposed connections between the golden ratio and human genome DNA.\n\nHowever, some have argued that many apparent manifestations of the golden ratio in nature, especially in regard to animal dimensions, are fictitious.\n\nStudies by psychologists, starting with Gustav Fechner, have been devised to test the idea that the golden ratio plays a role in human perception of beauty. While Fechner found a preference for rectangle ratios centered on the golden ratio, later attempts to test such a hypothesis have been inconclusive.\n\nExamples of disputed observations of the golden ratio include the following:\n\nBoth Egyptian pyramids and the regular square pyramids that resemble them can be analyzed with respect to the golden ratio and other ratios.\n\nA pyramid in which the apothem (slant height along the bisector of a face) is equal to times the semi-base (half the base width) is sometimes called a \"golden pyramid\". The isosceles triangle that is the face of such a pyramid can be constructed from the two halves of a diagonally split golden rectangle (of size semi-base by apothem), joining the medium-length edges to make the apothem. The height of this pyramid is formula_5 times the semi-base (that is, the slope of the face is formula_5); the square of the height is equal to the area of a face, times the square of the semi-base.\n\nThe medial right triangle of this \"golden\" pyramid (see diagram), with sides formula_7 is interesting in its own right, demonstrating via the Pythagorean theorem the relationship formula_8 or formula_9. This Kepler triangle\nis the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in geometric progression, just as the 3–4–5 triangle is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in arithmetic progression. The angle with tangent formula_5 corresponds to the angle that the side of the pyramid makes with respect to the ground, 51.827... degrees (51° 49' 38\").\n\nA nearly similar pyramid shape, but with rational proportions, is described in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (the source of a large part of modern knowledge of ancient Egyptian mathematics), based on the 3:4:5 triangle; the face slope corresponding to the angle with tangent 4/3 is 53.13 degrees (53 degrees and 8 minutes). The slant height or apothem is 5/3 or 1.666... times the semi-base. The Rhind papyrus has another pyramid problem as well, again with rational slope (expressed as run over rise). Egyptian mathematics did not include the notion of irrational numbers, and the rational inverse slope (run/rise, multiplied by a factor of 7 to convert to their conventional units of palms per cubit) was used in the building of pyramids.\n\nAnother mathematical pyramid with proportions almost identical to the \"golden\" one is the one with perimeter equal to 2 times the height, or h:b = 4:. This triangle has a face angle of 51.854° (51°51'), very close to the 51.827° of the Kepler triangle. This pyramid relationship corresponds to the coincidental relationship formula_11.\n\nEgyptian pyramids very close in proportion to these mathematical pyramids are known.\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, Röber studied various Egyptian pyramids including Khafre, Menkaure and some of the Giza, Sakkara, and Abusir groups, and was interpreted as saying that half the base of the side of the pyramid is the middle mean of the side, forming what other authors identified as the Kepler triangle; many other mathematical theories of the shape of the pyramids have also been explored.\n\nOne Egyptian pyramid is remarkably close to a \"golden pyramid\"—the Great Pyramid of Giza (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu). Its slope of 51° 52' is extremely close to the \"golden\" pyramid inclination of 51° 50' and the -based pyramid inclination of 51° 51'; other pyramids at Giza (Chephren, 52° 20', and Mycerinus, 50° 47') are also quite close. Whether the relationship to the golden ratio in these pyramids is by design or by accident remains open to speculation. Several other Egyptian pyramids are very close to the rational 3:4:5 shape.\n\nAdding fuel to controversy over the architectural authorship of the Great Pyramid, Eric Temple Bell, mathematician and historian, claimed in 1950 that Egyptian mathematics would not have supported the ability to calculate the slant height of the pyramids, or the ratio to the height, except in the case of the 3:4:5 pyramid, since the 3:4:5 triangle was the only right triangle known to the Egyptians and they did not know the Pythagorean theorem, nor any way to reason about irrationals such as or .\n\nMichael Rice asserts that principal authorities on the history of Egyptian architecture have argued that the Egyptians were well acquainted with the golden ratio and that it is part of mathematics of the Pyramids, citing Giedon (1957). Historians of science have always debated whether the Egyptians had any such knowledge or not, contending rather that its appearance in an Egyptian building is the result of chance.\n\nIn 1859, the pyramidologist John Taylor claimed that, in the Great Pyramid of Giza, the golden ratio is represented by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle θ to the ground, to half the length of the side of the square base, equivalent to the secant of the angle θ. The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, Howard Vyse, according to Matila Ghyka, reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of slant height to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.\n\nUsually, the lowercase form of phi (φ or ) is used to symbolize the golden ratio. Sometimes the uppercase form (formula_12) is used for the reciprocal of the golden ratio, 1/.\n\nTwo quantities \"a\" and \"b\" are said to be in the \"golden ratio\" if\n\nOne method for finding the value of is to start with the left fraction. Through simplifying the fraction and substituting in b/a = 1/,\n\nTherefore,\n\nMultiplying by gives\n\nwhich can be rearranged to\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, two solutions are obtained:\n\nand\n\nBecause is the ratio between positive quantities is necessarily positive:\n\nThe golden ratio is an irrational number. Below are two short proofs of irrationality:\n\nRecall that:\n\nIf we call the whole \"n\" and the longer part \"m\", then the second statement above becomes\n\nor, algebraically\n\nTo say that the golden ratio is rational means that is a fraction \"n\"/\"m\" where \"n\" and \"m\" are integers. We may take \"n\"/\"m\" to be in lowest terms and \"n\" and \"m\" to be positive. But if \"n\"/\"m\" is in lowest terms, then the identity labeled (*) above says \"m\"/(\"n\" − \"m\") is in still lower terms. That is a contradiction that follows from the assumption that is rational.\n\nAnother short proof—perhaps more commonly known—of the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the closure of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. If formula_22 is rational, then formula_23 is also rational, which is a contradiction if it is already known that the square root of a non-square natural number is irrational.\n\nThe golden ratio is also an algebraic number and even an algebraic integer. It has minimal polynomial\n\nHaving degree 2, this polynomial actually has two roots, the other being the golden ratio conjugate.\n\nThe conjugate root to the minimal polynomial x − x − 1 is\n\nThe absolute value of this quantity (≈ 0.618) corresponds to the length ratio taken in reverse order (shorter segment length over longer segment length, \"b/a\"), and is sometimes referred to as the \"golden ratio conjugate\". It is denoted here by the capital Phi (formula_12):\n\nAlternatively, formula_12 can be expressed as\n\nThis illustrates the unique property of the golden ratio among positive numbers, that\n\nor its inverse:\n\nThis means 0.61803...:1 = 1:1.61803...\n\nThe formula = 1 + 1/ can be expanded recursively to obtain a continued fraction for the golden ratio:\n\nand its reciprocal:\n\nThe convergents of these continued fractions (1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, 13/8, ..., or 1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, ...) are ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThe equation = 1 + likewise produces the continued square root, or infinite surd, form:\n\nAn infinite series can be derived to express phi:\n\nAlso:\n\nThese correspond to the fact that the length of the diagonal of a regular pentagon is times the length of its side, and similar relations in a pentagram.\n\nThe number turns up frequently in geometry, particularly in figures with pentagonal symmetry.\nThe length of a regular pentagon's diagonal is times its side.\nThe vertices of a regular icosahedron are those of three mutually orthogonal golden rectangles.\n\nThere is no known general algorithm to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, \"Thomson problem\"). However, a useful approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal surface area and placing one node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. 360°/ ≅ 222.5°. This method was used to arrange the 1500 mirrors of the student-participatory satellite Starshine-3.\n\nApplication examples you can see in the articles Pentagon with a given side length, Decagon with given circumcircle and Decagon with a given side length.\n\nBoth the above displayed different algorithms produce geometric constructions that determine two aligned line segments where the ratio of the longer to the shorter one is the golden ratio.\nThe golden triangle can be characterized as an isosceles triangle ABC with the property that bisecting the angle C produces a new triangle CXB which is a similar triangle to the original.\n\nIf angle BCX = α, then XCA = α because of the bisection, and CAB = α because of the similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the original isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.\n\nSuppose XB has length 1, and we call BC length . Because of the isosceles triangles XC=XA and BC=XC, so these are also length φ. Length AC = AB, therefore equals  + 1. But triangle ABC is similar to triangle CXB, so AC/BC = BC/BX, AC/ = φ/1, and so AC also equals . Thus = φ + 1, confirming that is indeed the golden ratio.\n\nSimilarly, the ratio of the area of the larger triangle AXC to the smaller CXB is equal to , while the inverse ratio is φ − 1.\n\nIn a regular pentagon the ratio of a diagonal to a side is the golden ratio, while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio.\n\nGeorge Odom has given a remarkably simple construction for involving an equilateral triangle: if an equilateral triangle is inscribed in a circle and the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides is produced to intersect the circle in either of two points, then these three points are in golden proportion. This result is a straightforward consequence of the intersecting chords theorem and can be used to construct a regular pentagon, a construction that attracted the attention of the noted Canadian geometer H. S. M. Coxeter who published it in Odom's name as a diagram in the \"American Mathematical Monthly\" accompanied by the single word \"Behold!\" \n\nThe golden ratio plays an important role in the geometry of pentagrams. Each intersection of edges sections other edges in the golden ratio. Also, the ratio of the length of the shorter segment to the segment bounded by the two intersecting edges (a side of the pentagon in the pentagram's center) is , as the four-color illustration shows.\n\nThe pentagram includes ten isosceles triangles: five acute and five obtuse isosceles triangles. In all of them, the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is . The acute triangles are golden triangles. The obtuse isosceles triangles are golden gnomons.\n\nThe golden ratio properties of a regular pentagon can be confirmed by applying Ptolemy's theorem to the quadrilateral formed by removing one of its vertices. If the quadrilateral's long edge and diagonals are \"b\", and short edges are \"a\", then Ptolemy's theorem gives \"b\" = \"a\" + \"ab\" which yields\n\nConsider a triangle with sides of lengths \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\" in decreasing order. Define the \"scalenity\" of the triangle to be the smaller of the two ratios \"a\"/\"b\" and \"b\"/\"c\". The scalenity is always less than and can be made as close as desired to .\n\nIf the side lengths of a triangle form a geometric progression and are in the ratio 1 : \"r\" : \"r\", where \"r\" is the common ratio, then \"r\" must lie in the range −1 < \"r\" < , which is a consequence of the triangle inequality (the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be strictly bigger than the length of the third side). If \"r\" = then the shorter two sides are 1 and but their sum is , thus \"r\" < . A similar calculation shows that \"r\" > −1. A triangle whose sides are in the ratio 1 : : is a right triangle (because 1 + = ) known as a Kepler triangle.\n\nA golden rhombus is a rhombus whose diagonals are in the golden ratio. The rhombic triacontahedron is a convex polytope that has a very special property: all of its faces are golden rhombi. In the rhombic triacontahedron the dihedral angle between any two adjacent rhombi is 144°, which is twice the isosceles angle of a golden triangle and four times its most acute angle.\n\nThe mathematics of the golden ratio and of the Fibonacci sequence are intimately interconnected. The Fibonacci sequence is:\n\nA closed-form expression for the Fibonacci sequence involves the golden ratio:\n\nThe golden ratio is the limit of the ratios of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence (or any Fibonacci-like sequence), as originally shown by Kepler:\n\nIn other words, if a Fibonacci number is divided by its immediate predecessor in the sequence, the quotient approximates ; e.g., 987/610  1.6180327868852. These approximations are alternately lower and higher than , and converge to as the Fibonacci numbers increase, and:\n\nMore generally:\n\nwhere above, the ratios of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence, is a case when formula_45\n\nFurthermore, the successive powers of obey the Fibonacci recurrence:\n\nThis identity allows any polynomial in to be reduced to a linear expression. For example:\n\nThe reduction to a linear expression can be accomplished in one step by using the relationship\nwhere formula_49 is the \"k\"th Fibonacci number.\n\nHowever, this is no special property of , because polynomials in any solution \"x\" to a quadratic equation can be reduced in an analogous manner, by applying:\nfor given coefficients \"a\", \"b\" such that \"x\" satisfies the equation. Even more generally, any rational function (with rational coefficients) of the root of an irreducible \"n\"th-degree polynomial over the rationals can be reduced to a polynomial of degree Phrased in terms of field theory, if α is a root of an irreducible \"n\"th-degree polynomial, then formula_51 has degree \"n\" over formula_52, with basis formula_53\n\nThe golden ratio and inverse golden ratio formula_54 have a set of symmetries that preserve and interrelate them. They are both preserved by the fractional linear transformations formula_55 – this fact corresponds to the identity and the definition quadratic equation.\nFurther, they are interchanged by the three maps formula_56 – they are reciprocals, symmetric about formula_57, and (projectively) symmetric about 2.\n\nMore deeply, these maps form a subgroup of the modular group formula_58 isomorphic to the symmetric group on 3 letters, formula_59 corresponding to the stabilizer of the set formula_60 of 3 standard points on the projective line, and the symmetries correspond to the quotient map formula_61 – the subgroup formula_62 consisting of the 3-cycles and the identity formula_63 fixes the two numbers, while the 2-cycles interchange these, thus realizing the map.\n\nThe golden ratio has the simplest expression (and slowest convergence) as a continued fraction expansion of any irrational number (see \"Alternate forms\" above). It is, for that reason, one of the worst cases of Lagrange's approximation theorem and it is an extremal case of the Hurwitz inequality for Diophantine approximations. This may be why angles close to the golden ratio often show up in phyllotaxis (the growth of plants).\n\nThe defining quadratic polynomial and the conjugate relationship lead to decimal values that have their fractional part in common with :\n\nThe sequence of powers of contains these values 0.618..., 1.0, 1.618..., 2.618...; more generally,\nany power of is equal to the sum of the two immediately preceding powers:\n\nAs a result, one can easily decompose any power of into a multiple of and a constant. The multiple and the constant are always adjacent Fibonacci numbers. This leads to another property of the positive powers of :\n\nIf formula_67, then:\n\nWhen the golden ratio is used as the base of a numeral system (see Golden ratio base, sometimes dubbed \"phinary\" or \"-nary\"), every integer has a terminating representation, despite being irrational, but every fraction has a non-terminating representation.\n\nThe golden ratio is a fundamental unit of the algebraic number field formula_70 and is a Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number. In the field formula_70 we have formula_72, where formula_73 is the formula_74-th Lucas number.\n\nThe golden ratio also appears in hyperbolic geometry, as the maximum distance from a point on one side of an ideal triangle to the closer of the other two sides: this distance, the side length of the equilateral triangle formed by the points of tangency of a circle inscribed within the ideal triangle, is formula_75.\n\nThe golden ratio's decimal expansion can be calculated directly from the expression\n\nwith ≈ 2.2360679774997896964 . The square root of 5 can be calculated with the Babylonian method, starting with an initial estimate such as \"x\" = 2 and iterating\n\nfor \"n\" = 1, 2, 3, ..., until the difference between \"x\" and \"x\" becomes zero, to the desired number of digits.\n\nThe Babylonian algorithm for is equivalent to Newton's method for solving the equation \"x\" − 5 = 0. In its more general form, Newton's method can be applied directly to any algebraic equation, including the equation \"x\" − x − 1 = 0 that defines the golden ratio. This gives an iteration that converges to the golden ratio itself,\n\nfor an appropriate initial estimate \"x\" such as \"x\" = 1. A slightly faster method is to rewrite the equation as \"x\" − 1 − 1/\"x\" = 0, in which case the Newton iteration becomes\n\nThese iterations all converge quadratically; that is, each step roughly doubles the number of correct digits. The golden ratio is therefore relatively easy to compute with arbitrary precision. The time needed to compute \"n\" digits of the golden ratio is proportional to the time needed to divide two \"n\"-digit numbers. This is considerably faster than known algorithms for the transcendental numbers and .\n\nAn easily programmed alternative using only integer arithmetic is to calculate two large consecutive Fibonacci numbers and divide them. The ratio of Fibonacci numbers \"F\" and \"F\" , each over 5000 digits, yields over 10,000 significant digits of the golden ratio.\n\nThe decimal expansion of the golden ratio has been calculated to an accuracy of two trillion ( = 2,000,000,000,000) digits.\n\nFootnotes\nCitations\n\n\n"}

Since it is often uttered by service employees to customers at the end of a transaction, particularly in Israel and the United States, its repetitious and dutiful usage has resulted in the phrase developing, according to some journalists and scholars, especially outside of these two countries, a cultural connotation of impersonality, lack of interest, passive–aggressive behavior, or sarcasm. The phrase is generally not used in Europe, as some find it artificial or even offensive. Critics of the phrase characterize it as an imperative, obliging the person to have a nice day. Other critics argue that it is a parting platitude that comes across as pretended. While defenders of the phrase agree that \"Have a nice day\" can be used insincerely, they consider the phrase to be comforting, in that it improves interactions among people. Others favor the phrase because it does not require a response.\n\nA variant of the phrase—\"have a good day\"—is first recorded in \"Layamon's Brut\" (c. 1205) and \"King Horn\". \"Have a nice day\" itself first appeared in the 1948 film \"A Letter to Three Wives\". In the United States, the phrase was first used on a regular basis in the early to mid 1960s by FAA air traffic controllers and pilots. It was subsequently popularized by truck drivers talking on CB radios. Variations on the phrase include \"have a good one\" and \"have a nice one\". In conjunction with the smiley face, the phrase became a defining cultural emblem of the 1970s and was a key theme in the 1991 film \"My Own Private Idaho\". By 2000, \"have a nice day\" and \"have a good day\" were taken metaphorically, synonymous with the parting phrase \"goodbye\".\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" recorded the earliest uses of one the phrase's variants—\"have a good day\"—as being \"Habbeð alle godne dæie\" in \"Layamon's Brut\" (c. 1205) and \"Rymenhild, have wel godne day\" in \"King Horn\" (1225). According to Roland Dickison of California State University, \"have a good day\" first appeared in Geoffrey Chaucer's 1387 \"The Canterbury Tales\": \"And hoom wente every man the righte way, there was namoore but 'Fare wel, have a good day. Routinely employed by Chaucer in his literary works, \"have a good day\" disappeared for several centuries before its revival.\n\nWilliam Safire of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"have a nice day\" first appeared in the 1948 film \"A Letter to Three Wives\". \"The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms\" stated that \"have a nice day\" first came into being in 1920, and the phrase and its variants became widely used after the 1950s. In 1964, Carol Reed of WCBS-TV spread the phrase in the New York metropolitan area by closing her weather reports with \"have a happy day\", which, according to Safire, is a variant of \"have a nice day\". The 1960s saw the phrase \"have a good day\" become prevalent and supersede \"happy day\". Numerous hippies, when parting, told each other to \"have a nice day\" or \"have a beautiful day\". In 1970, \"have a nice city\" was a mayoralty slogan in San Francisco. In 1972, during the Vietnam War, family members of POW/MIA members of the American armed forces participated in South Boston's Saint Patrick's Day march. They carried a black banner that read \"POW/MIA Families Never Have a Nice Day\". They received scowls and jeers from a hostile crowd. One woman said, \"They should be shot for bringing this here.\"\n\nBy around 2000, \"have a nice day\" and \"have a good day\" were taken metaphorically, morphing into synonyms of the parting phrase \"goodbye\".\n\nAbigail Goldman of the \"Los Angeles Times\", wrote that the smiley face and the expression \"have a nice day\" \"helped to define the '70s\". In the early 1970s, Philadelphian brothers Murray and Bernard Spain designed and sold products including bumper stickers and coffee mugs that each contained the yellow smiley face, usually attributed to Harvey Ball. They later changed the phrase to \"Have a nice day\".\n\nThe 1991 film \"My Own Private Idaho\" ironically ends with the parting phrase \"have a nice day\", which for the fourth time invokes the smiley face. Smiley faces represent optimism and appear to ask the characters, who are characterized as \"marginal figures\", how nice their days are. While traveling to Idaho, the protagonists' motorcycle breaks down, and one of the characters, Mike, gazes at the sun on the horizon and links it with the motto \"have a nice day\". He says, \"I've been on this road before. Looks like a fucked-up face. Like it's saying 'have a nice day' or something.\"\n\nIn the 1994 film \"Forrest Gump\", title character Forrest is jogging down the street when a T-shirt salesman approaches him, asking him to put his face on T-shirts as inspiration to people. While the men are jogging, a truck splashes mud into Forrest's face, and the salesman gives him a yellow shirt to wipe the mud off. Forrest rolls up the shirt and hands it back, saying \"have a nice day\". Unrolling the shirt, the man finds a smiley face outlined on it. Thus the film credits Forrest Gump with inventing the \"Smiley\" logo and the \"have a nice day\" slogan.\n\nIn September 2005, Bon Jovi released the album \"Have a Nice Day\". The album cover contains a red smiley face which guitarist Richie Sambora stated echoes its title song. Sambora explained that \"It's [like] 'Have a nice day; get out of my face'—therefore the smirk. To me, it's much more of a Clint Eastwood 'Have a nice day' than a smiley face 'Have a nice day.'\"\n\nThe phrase \"have a nice day\" is typically spoken by service employees or clerks to customers at the end of a transaction. A mercantile method of expressing \"thank you\" as in \"thank you for shopping with us\" or \"thank you for using our service\", it is commonly used among people in the United States and by retailers in New Zealand and elsewhere. In the 1970s, the American supermarket chain Kmart opened a store in Brisbane, Australia. The workers were trained to say, \"Thank you for shopping at K-Mart. Have a nice day.\"\n\nOther versions of \"have a nice day\" are \"have a good one\" and \"have a nice one.\" The phrase was universalized after 1950 by truck drivers conversing on their CB radios. Scientific studies indicate that people who regularly smile are more likely to say \"have a nice day\". The phrase can have passive–aggressive connotations, and can be caustically used to end transactions with abusive customers. The speaker may also use the phrase ironically, in either a purposeful or unintentional manner.\n\nRoly Sussex of \"The Courier-Mail\" wrote that \"have a nice day\" can sound \"a touch brusque\" in comparison with \"you have a nice day\". Deeming the word \"you\" as moderating the imperative, Sussex stated that the word \"you\" causes the phrase to seem like a mixture of a command and a hope. He wrote that using \"you\" in imperatives is more common with people under 25. In her 2001 book \"The Facts on File Dictionary of Clichés\", Christina Ammer wrote about the growing usage of \"have a good meal\" in restaurants. Ammer opined that the phrase \"induces teeth-gnashing irritation when voiced by a particularly incompetent waiter\".\n\nAcademic Sandi Mann's interviews found that the British wished and demanded cordiality from service personnel, more than from their coworkers. Israelis, Americans, and Australians, on the other hand, wanted friendliness from both their coworkers and service personnel. Mann explains that the British do not expect a \"smiley\" display from colleagues because they have more time to build longer-term relationships. Those in the service industry, though, have to become \"one-minute friends\" each time they interact with customers.\n\nOn July 14, 1979, the \"Chicago Tribune\" published an article titled \"This is a holdup; have a nice day\" about a Minneapolis robber; while robbing the First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Chicago, the man gave a note to the bank teller that said \"Thank you, and have a nice day\". On November 3, 2007, two robbers equipped with handguns stole money from a kiosk at a Vale, North Carolina store; the \"Hickory Daily Record\" called them \"courteous crooks\" because after the theft, they told people to \"have a nice day\".\n\nBefore the Binghamton shootings on April 3, 2009, the perpetrator sent a rambling diatribe against the police to News 10 Now; the letter concluded with the chilling message \"COP BRiNG ABOUT THiS SHOOTiNG COP MUST RESPONSiBLE. AND YOU HAVE A NiCE DAY\". In the Cumbria shootings on June 2, 2010, the belligerent mocked one of his victims by saying \"have a nice day\" to her while he shot her in the face. The victim, who survived the incident, told reporters later she felt \"[i]t was just like something out of \"The Terminator\"\".\n\n\"Have a nice day\" is frequently used in the Israeli retail and service industries. Jerry Levin wrote in his 2005 book \"West Bank Diary: Middle East Violence as Reported by a Former American Hostage\" about a woman in a coffee shop telling him to \"have a nice day\" after he purchased a sweet roll and coffee. Levin stated that there is also a \"grimmer version of the pervasive pleasantry\". After an Israeli soldier destroyed the memory card of Levin's camera, the soldier told him with a jocular smirk, \"have a nice day\".\n\nIn 2005, the Mosawa Center for Arab Rights in Israel paid for ads on television and radio stations in Israel. In the television ads, the Arabic phrase for \"have a nice day\" would flash onto the screen in black letters and on a red background. Immediately following the Arabic phrase would be a Hebrew phrase that said, \"Are you already against it without even knowing what it says? All we wanted to say is have a nice day.\" Spokeswoman Abir Kopty stated that \"[t]he purpose of this campaign was mainly to cause the Israeli public sitting at home, or walking down the street, to ask itself why it had a negative reaction to everything Arab, even if it is the simplest phrase.\" Kopty further said that the Mosawa Center wanted to encourage Arabs to be more active and more visible in the community.\n\nAccording to \"Korean Studies\" published by the University of Hawaii at Manoa, \"have a nice day\" is sometimes used in Korea. \"Korean Studies\" wrote that it \"seemed somehow to fit nicely\" with the phrase \"Caymi posey yo\", which is frequently used in Korean shops to say goodbye.\n\nEuropeans generally feel the phrase \"have a nice day\" is fake and that the speaker is solely interacting with the listener for business purposes. It is generally not used in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe phrase \"have a nice day\" spread to Britain from the United States. In Britain, the variants \"have a fine day\" and \"have a good day\" are frequently used in place of \"have a nice day\". British customers generally consider it to be obnoxious and overbearing, instead usually preferring the gentler expression \"enjoy the rest of your afternoon\".\n\nIn their 2002 book \"Different Games, Different Rules\", Haru Yamada and Deborah Tannen recalled teaching a class in London, where a student construed \"have a nice day\" to be insincere. The student said that Americans \"say things like that with this big fake smile on their face, and they don't really mean it\". Not having the context of the metaphor, the student took the phrase literally and was unable to discern the intended cordiality. Conversely, when Americans visit stores in Britain where the salespeople engage not in \"have a nice day\" salesmanship, Americans regard British as lacking customer service.\n\nGuy Browning penned an article in 2007 titled \"How to... have a nice day\" for \"The Guardian\", writing that sarcasm will creep into the discussion if the British say \"have a nice day\". Browning explained that in Britain, people assume that the day will be horrible—even catastrophic. He wrote that for the United States though, \"nice days and the having thereof are written into the constitution\".\n\nIn Germany, \"Schönen Tag noch!\", the German phrase for \"have a nice day\", is being used more frequently by its vendors and waiters. German author Hyde Flippo wrote that many Germans deem \"have a nice day\" to be affected and shallow. Flippo further opined that the phrase is an appropriate example of culturally improper language. He compared it to smiling arbitrarily at a German person which would give the impression that the smiler is a \"little simple-minded or not quite 'all there'\". Writing that Germans prefer \"Auf Wiedersehen!\" or \"Tschüss!\" (both meaning \"goodbye\")—which German shopkeepers frequently use—to \"dubious wishes for a nice day\" he opined that that is why Germans generally favor visiting a small shop instead of a large department store.\n\nThe French also concur that the phrase is insincere. Author Natalie Schorr wrote that the French frequently say \"bonne journée\"—\"good day\" in French—and do not consider it to be insincere. Schorr explains that \"bonne journée\" is a \"gracious \"formule de politesse\"\", similar to \"merci\" and \"s'il vous plaît\". However, \"have a nice day\" sounds like a trite phrase spoken by a telemarketer.\n\nIn Sweden, Lennart Fridén, a member of the Parliament of Sweden, lamented in a January 1995 speech to Parliament the usage of \"ha en bra dag\"—\"have a nice day\" in Swedish. Fridén stated that the increased usage of English loan expressions like \"ha en bra dag\" \"impairs our sense of language and style\". He proposed a motion that an authoritative body, working in conjunction with linguistic institutions, be delegated the job of \"caring for the Swedish language\"; the motion did not pass.\n\nThe Boston-born American author Edith Shillue wrote in her 2003 book \"Peace Comes Dropping Slow\" that when the Irish stereotyped Americans, they tended to use the phrase \"have a nice day\". While lodging at a house in Ireland, Shillue found a drawing on the wall for American visitors like her. Drawn by her host's daughters, the picture had the phrase \"Have a ______ Day\", with a smiley faced affixed instead of the word \"nice\". Irish author Aidan Higgins wrote in his 2004 book \"A Bestiary\" that the Americanization of Ireland led the Irish to say phrases like \"No problem!\" or \"Have a nice day!\" even when there is drenching rain.\n\nIn the United States, \"good morning\", \"good afternoon\", \"good evening\", and \"good night\" were previously the normal farewell addresses for a lengthy period of time. The common valediction has become \"have a nice day\". \nAccording to the \"Handbook of Hispanic Cultures in the United States\", \"[t]enga un nice day\" is an example of Cuban Spanglish. This is distinguished from Chicano Spanish, in that the Chicano second-generation and beyond, who are inclined to code-switch, generally do not speak in the formal address form of \"tenga\".\n\nIn a New York courtroom, a judge sentenced a man to a seven- to ten-year jail term at the Auburn State Prison for committing a robbery. The judge's final words were \"You are hereby remanded to the custody of the sheriff's department for delivery to the custody of state officials. Have a nice day.\" Jack Sheehan of WKRT stated that the convict \"almost sank to his knees. The phrase had worked its magic.\"\n\nJewish-American comedian Alan King joked in his book \"Matzo Balls for Breakfast\" that Jews rarely say \"'have a nice day', or even have one\". He wrote that \"[t]o be honest, I've never heard a Jew say that.\"\n\nSandi Mann, a business psychologist at the University of Central Lancashire, defines the \"Have a Nice Day\" culture as filled with \"fake smiles, forced \"bonhomie\", and meaningless demands by workers to 'have a nice day'\". Managers compel their employees to be attentive and affable with customers despite the fact that some employees do not feel these emotions.\n\nSandi Mann concludes from her research that the \"Have a Nice Day\" culture will prevail, becoming used by more companies and countries. In the service industry, for example, she explains that products have become more uniform over the past few decades. Thus, the sole way for companies to distinguish themselves is to have better customer service. She notes that there are positive and negative effects. A positive effect is that it is beneficial for business and for people who enjoy fake displays. A negative effect is that emotions incompatible with the \"Have a Nice Day\" culture are repressed, leading to what Mann terms the \"Have a Nice Day\" syndrome. In an interview for the \"Wall Street Journal\", an employee of a telemarketing company, was called a son of a bitch. Clenching his teeth, he responded \"Thank you very much, you have a nice day.\" The stress of suppressing their feelings and faking cheerfulness caused people like the telemarketer to feel insincere and phony. Individuals affected by the \"Have a Nice Day\" syndrome must carry out emotional labor, which could lead to diminished self-esteem, depression, and cynicism.\n\nLinguistically, \"have a nice day\" is a command in that the subject, the pronoun you, is intimated. It could be regarded as an exhortation to achieve an outcome that the recipient has no power to influence. However, it is also possible to interpret the phrase as a contraction of \"\"I hope that you\" have a nice day\".\n\nKerry LePage wrote in his 2004 book \"Some Day Never Comes\" that he chooses to have a nice day based on his own choice, not that of another person. J. Broad wrote in his 2007 book \"Some Day Never Comes\" that the phrase causes people to feel they have an obligation to have a nice day. Mike Royko wrote in his 2002 book \"For the Love of Mike\" that people may have a bad day, not a nice one, because they \"confront a demanding boss, a nasty customer, a crabby teacher\".\n\nAccording to author John Tschohl, the tediousness of the phrase is exemplified by employees uttering the words so faintly as to be barely audible. The phrase is occasionally used in an ironic manner when others have been disrespectful or have negatively impacted the speaker. In Detroit, a supermarket started a program to have its cashiers tell every customer to \"have a nice day\" after completing their transactions. After conducting surveys, they realized that more than half of the customers were unaware of whether the clerk had said the phrase. In addition, a number of customers commented that they despised being told to \"have a nice day\". In a 2006 study, researchers at Frankfurt University discovered that people who must smile and say \"have a nice day\" in their jobs are more prone to illness. Flight attendants, waiters, and call center operators, as well as others who are forced to act cheerfully, are more likely to become depressed. This can lead to decreased immune system function.\n\nAustralian \"Andrew Biggs\" of the \"Bangkok Post\" wrote that in the past, the phrase was heard exclusively in Hollywood movies and American soap operas. He lamented that by the 1970s, Aussie teenagers were compelled to tell customers to \"have a nice day\", a \"blatant American cliche\". Biggs stated that \"have a nice day\" is \"an idiom that's been mashed and mangled over the decades\".\n\nJan C. Snow laments that the phrase was trite and indicative of the speaker's lack of vocabulary. She wrote that on Saturdays, people could be asked to \"have a relaxing day\". People with highly variable jobs such as emergency room nurses may appreciate \"have a routine day\", while mothers of young children may wish to \"have a quiet day\". Debbie Lundberg wrote in her 2008 book \"Have a Nice Day Is Not Thank You, and No Problem Is Not You're Welcome\" that service people should say \"thank you\" instead of \"have a nice day\". She argued that \"thank you\" is shorter and is a \"recognition of the ability you have to thank someone\", which adds more worth to the purchase than something that will occur in the future. Paul V. Marshall, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Bethlehem, concurred, writing in the \"Reading Eagle\" that he prefers \"thank you\" to \"have a nice day\" or \"have a great day\" even though \"thank you\" has a \"host of socially acceptable responses\". He stated that when people say \"thank you\", they admit that they are dependent on others, which leads to a healthier, safer society.\n\nJ. Broad wrote that the phrase \"have a nice day\" is an apt middle ground for the \"drop dead\" the cashier is thinking and the \"come back soon\" the owner wants. Broad stated that the phrase is meaningless because it has been castrated by excessive usage and pretense. He compared the phrase to the salutation \"How are you?\" and the phrase \"had a lovely time\", which are \"conversational space-fillers\" that help prevent embarrassing silences. Usage of the term has been compared to inserting the phrase \"you know\" or the word \"like\" in sentences. In 1982, comedian George Carlin joked at Carnegie Hall, \"That's the trouble with 'Have a nice day'; it puts all the pressure on you. Now you've got to go out and somehow manage to have a good time, all because of some loose-lipped cashier. 'Have a nice day ...' Maybe I don't feel like having a nice day. Maybe, just maybe, I've had 116 nice days in a row and I'm ready, by God, for a crappy day.\"\n\nWilliam Safire of \"The New York Times\" wrote that when the speaker of the phrase is genuine and maintains eye contact, the act is a \"social asset and a note of civility\" in a busy world. However, he stated that when the phrase is robotically said or said in a tone similar to \"get lost\", the utterance \"comes across with a resounding clank of falsity\". Marilyn Gardner of \"The Christian Science Monitor\" wrote that the \"bland age of 'Have-a-nice-day' should come to a deserving end\". She opined that service could not be \"peddled as an image\", and that substance is more important than style. Satirical commentator Russell Baker wrote in the \"Chicago Tribune\" that he did not know Ma Bell was waning until she began using the phrase \"have a nice day\".\n\nMiss Manners wrote in her 1990 book \"Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium\" that although the phrase was trite, she wondered whether there was \"so much deeply felt good will\" permeating through the world that shallow friendliness ought to desist. She stated that for her, saying \"goodbye\" is sufficient because it expresses the same well-wishing farewell sentiment. Leil Lowndes wrote in her 2009 book \"How to Instantly Connect with Anyone\" that if someone says \"have a nice day\", the recipient should refrain from sarcastically responding \"Thanks, but I have other plans\" or \"Gee, I was planning on having a miserable one, but now that you mention it, I think I'll have a nice one.\" Lowndes suggested that the response merely be \"You, too.\"\n\nCarol Swiderski of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that although saying \"have a nice day\" may not be sincere, the speaker has acknowledged that the recipient is there. She argued \"[h]ave we become so analytic that we can't accept these little niceties without asking ourselves, 'Did he really mean it? Does she really care if I have a nice day?'\" Writing that society has become so automated that going through a check-out line at a grocery store without having made eye contact or spoken with the checker is possible, Swiderski favored \"insincerely meant human kindness to a robot\". She encouraged people to respond to \"have a nice day\" with \"you have a nice day, too\" because she hoped that when a sufficient number of people do this, there could be a time when people will sincerely intend it.\n\nJeff Corbett of \"The Newcastle Herald\" defended \"have a nice day\" despite his characterization of the phrase as \"wincingly American and so patently false in its sing-song delivery\" by cashiers. Corbett favored the phrase to the inquiries of the shopkeepers about his life; he preferred \"have a nice day\" because it did not entail a response.\n\nJanice Turner of \"The Times\" supported the phrase, writing that she is indifferent to it being used insincerely or 1,000 times a day. She wrote that \"have a nice day\" is \"soothing, even kind\", in that it improves the interactions among millions of people crowded together.\n\nWilliam F. Wyatt Jr. of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that \"have a nice day\" used to be new and \"fill[ed] a needed slot\". \"Goodbye\", he stated, inappropriately indicates that salespeople are intimate with customers they do not know and would seem forced. \"Farewell\", Wyatt said, would feel abnormal and could only be employed in an ironic context. The close of a transaction needed an oral ending. \"Have a nice day\" was the apt phrase for those who serve people they do not know to end a transaction.\n\n"}
{"id": "31934213", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31934213", "title": "Hermeticism (poetry)", "text": "Hermeticism (poetry)\n\nHermeticism in poetry, or hermetic poetry, is a form of obscure and difficult poetry, as of the Symbolist school, wherein the language and imagery are subjective, and where the suggestive power of the sound of words is as important as their meaning. The name alludes to the mythical Hermes Trismegistus, supposed author of mystic doctrines composed in the Neoplatonic tradition.\n\nHermeticism was influential in the Renaissance, after the translation of these Neoplatonic texts by Marsilio Ficino. Within the Novecento Italiano, Hermetic poetry became an Italian literary movement in the 1920s and 1930s, developing between the two world wars. Major features of this movement were reduction to essentials, abolishment of punctuation, and brief, synthetic compositions, at times resulting in short works of only two or three verses.\n\nThe term ermetismo was coined in Italian by literary critic Francesco Flora (although with a very generic and superficial connotation) in 1936 and recalls a mystic conception of the poetic word because it makes reference to the legendary figure of Hermes Trismegistus (\"Thrice-Great Hermes\") going back to hellenistic times, with writings such as \"Asclepius\" and the \"Corpus Hermeticum\" attributed to him. During the same year (1936), Italian poet Carlo Bo published an essay on the literary magazine \"Il Frontespizio\", by the title \"Letteratura come vita (Literature as a way of life)\", containing the theoretical-methodological fundamentals of hermetic poetry.\n\nOn the literary plane, the term \"Hermeticism\" thus highlights a type of poetry which has a \"close\" (i.e., \"hermetic\", hidden, sealed) character, complex in its construction and usually achieved by a sequence of analogies difficult to interpret.\n\nAt the movement's core—which was modelled after the great French decadentist poets Mallarmé, Rimbaud and Verlaine—was a group of Italian poets, called \"hermeticists\", who followed the style of Giuseppe Ungaretti and Eugenio Montale.\n\nRejecting any direct social and political involvement, in order to detach themselves from the fascist culture, the hermetic group used a difficult and closed style in the analogic form, with a constant emotional introspection. Among these young intellectuals, some took strong anti-fascist stances, with Romano Bilenchi, Elio Vittorini, Alfonso Gatto and Vasco Pratolini being the main dissidents. \"Tradition is Hermeticism's best ally\".\n\nHermetic poetry opposes verbal manipulation and the ease of mass communication, which began taking place during Europe's dictatorial years, with the increasing brain-washing propaganda of the nazi-fascist regimes. Poetry therefore retreats into itself and assumes the task of returning sense to words, giving them back their semantic meaning, using them only when strictly necessary.\n\nThe hermetic poets pursue the ideal of a \"pure poesy\", an essential composition without educational aims. Their central theme is the desperate sense of loneliness modern man experiences, having lost the ancient values and myths of the romantic and positivistic society, no longer retaining any certitudes to refer to. Man lives in an incomprehensible world, ravaged by wars and enslaved by dictatorships, therefore the poet has a disheartened vision of life, without illusions, and repudiates the word as an act of communication in order to give it an evocative sense only. So, hermetic poetry is poetry of moods, of interior reflection expressed by a subdued and pensive tone, through a refined and evocative language, concealing direct intimations to experience in a play of allusions.\n\nTo describe the fleeting course of human life, Quasimodo would compose this famous hermetic poem \"Ed è subito sera\":\n\nThe hermetic poets took their inspiration from Ungaretti's second book, \"Sentimento del Tempo (\"The Feeling of Time\", 1933)\", with its complex analogies: one can thus consider Ungaretti as \"Hermeticism's\" first exponent.\n\nIn the field of hermetic literary critique, Carlo Bo was its main interpreter, with his discourse \"La letteratura come vita (\"Literature as a way of life\")\" dated 1938, where he wrote the actual hermetic manifesto by describing poetry as a moment of Absolute. Among the other critics and theoreticians, to be mentioned are Oreste Macrì, Giansiro Ferrata, Luciano Anceschi and Mario Luzi.\n\nDuring the second half of the 1930s, and important hermetic group arose in Florence, around the Italian magazines \"Il Frontespizio\" and \"Solaria\" who were inspired by the works of Giuseppe Ungaretti, Salvatore Quasimodo e Arturo Onofri, and directly referred to European symbolism, also approaching more recent movements such as surrealism and existentialism.\n\n\n"}

The main ideal of this party was to bring the Italian frontier up to the Gottardo Pass (\"Catena mediana delle Alpi\" ) in the Alps through political unrest and possible referendums (supported, in case of need, by the Italian Army).\n\nIn 1934 was done a small tentative by the Ticino fascists: the March on Bellinzona\", similar to the March on Rome. But it was successfully contrasted by socialist organizations, like \"Liberi e Svizzeri\" of Guglielmo Canevascini, promoted even by the Swiss government.\n\nSuccessively, in the 1935 elections the fascists obtained just 2% of the votes and since then their movement faded away to less than 100 members.\n\nBefore World War II the Italian irredentism in Switzerland was reduced to have followers mainly between the descendants of Italians emigrated to Ticino at the end of the 19th century, but was ruled and promoted by a small group of ticino intellectuals with their active newspapers and propaganda.\n\nThe most important of these intellectuals was Teresina Bontempi, who created the magazine \"L'Adula\". She denounced in her writings, together with Rosetta Colombi, the germanization of Canton Ticino promoted by the Swiss government. Indeed, the German speaking population in Canton Ticino went from 2.6% in 1837 to 5.34% in 1920 and nearly 10% in 1940.\n\nAs a consequence of this political activity she was involved in continuous problems with the Swiss government, that finally jailed her in 1936. She was forced to move to Italy as a political refugee after some months.\n\nThe most renowned fascist born in Canton Ticino was Aurelio Garobbio, who tried to imitate Gabriele D'Annunzio with his organization called \"Giovani Ticinesi\". After 1935 Garobbio was the main responsible of the Italian irredentism in Switzerland and was with Mussolini until his death in spring 1945, when tried to organize a last fascist area of defense in Valtellina next to Ticino.\n\n\n"}

The lectures, at which Casimir Lewy was present, contain Wittgenstein's thoughts about aesthetics and religion, alongside a critique of psychoanalysis. Wittgensteinian fideism originates from the remarks in the \"Lectures\". It is noteworthy that Eberhard Bubser in the introduction of the German edition states that: ″Wittgenstein would surely have not approved this release [...]″ (″Wittgenstein hätte diese Ausgabe bestimmt nicht gebilligt [...]″).\n\nOne question Wittgenstein raises in his \"Lectures on Aesthetics\" is how we learn to use and recognize the words used to make an aesthetic judgment, such as ″beautiful″ (″schön″) or ″nice″ or (″fein″). He suggests that these words are firstly and often used like interjections or gestures. Wittgenstein also notes that we seldom use these words in everyday language to make aesthetic judgments, but rather use words like ″right″ (″richtig″) or ″correct″ (″korrekt″). With regard to aesthetic pleasures, he also names a question that is recently under debate in aesthetics: How are distinctly aesthetic pleasures different from more ordinary pleasures? He makes a point in stating that ″One uses the same term in both cases [...]″ (″ Man gebraucht in beiden Fällen [...] dasselbe Wort″).\n\nA recurring theme in these lectures is also Wittgenstein's firm rejection of the possibility that psychology may explain aesthetic experiences or judgments. This opinion is based on Wittgenstein's view that psychological (behaviorist) experiments would generate results based on mere descriptions of behavior and generalizations across large numbers of observers.\n\nIn his Lectures on Religious Belief (\"Vorlesungen über den religiösen Glauben\"), Wittgenstein argues, among other things, that superficial grammatical similarities in the \"forms\" of both religious and factual statements mislead us into believing that they are fundamentally identical states of \"belief.\" This grammatical similarity, Wittgenstein argues, is merely a parallel \"expression\" of drastically different processes. \"The expression of belief\", Wittgenstein notes, \"may play an absolutely minor role.\"\n"}

The term was coined by a 20th-century artist, Thomas Wilfred. In the early 20th century artists began to promote colors and light together in their artworks. Wilfred worked towards establishing lumia as a new form of art but the term never caught on. Despite creating the term lumia, Wilfred did not create the use of light in art.\n\nThomas Wilfred, (1889–1968), was the first artist in the United States to use light as the sole means of expression for his artwork. He consistently used colored light in his works. Wilfred was born in Denmark in 1889 and emigrated to the U.S. in 1916. Wilfred explored light and color in art as early as 1905. In 1921, Wilfred created his first portable clavilux, a machine that allowed for the creation and performance of lumia. Clavilux is a term in Latin that means \"light played by key\". In 1930 Wilfred founded a center for research in lumia, the Art Institute of Light. The institute closed down during World War ll. In the early 1930s he transitioned from the musical aspect of lumia to painting. Wilfred planned to turn lumia into a formal art form, an \"eighth art\"; Wilfred wanted lumia to be its own art form of expression.\n\nThe three main elements of lumia, defined by Wilfred, are form, color, and motion in a dark space. The most important are said to be form and motion. Wilfred's original contribution to lumia was the introduction of a fourth dimension - time. Since 1924, lumia accompanied music, dance, and drama.\n\nIn a musical sense, Lumia is used to accompany music by adding a visual effect. Wilfred mentioned that Lumia has three factors, \"Form, color, and motion are the three basic factors in lumia - as in all visual experience - and form and motion are the two most important.\"\n\nA term also coined by Thomas Wilfred to refer to his invention that allowed the creation and performance of Lumia. Clavilux means \"light played by key\" in Latin. The term used by other artists was known as color organ. \nLouis-Bertrand Castel invented the first light organ in the seventeenth century. For more information check light organ or color organ.\n\nThere are different forms of art that use light as a medium:\nLight art is an art form that focuses on the expression of light. Light art includes stained glass which transmits light through colored glass. This type of art dates back to the 4th century. This art is found in churches and mosques with stained glass windows. Another used of light art is shadow puppetry in which shadows can create moving images. This art can be dated back to 380 BC by the use of Plato in the Allegory of the cave. Light art is even used in modern photography and motion pictures which uses artificial light to help captures images. Artists recognized for their use of light include James Turrell, Robert Irwin, Dan Flavin, Bruce Nauman, Jenny Holzer, Leo Villareal, and Mel and Dorothy Tanner.\nLight painting is a term used for a photographic technique. It is done by moving a light source or the camera while taking a long exposure photograph to produce a light painting. This creates a photograph that looks like it was painted with light. Painting with a light source dates back to 1889.\n"}
{"id": "3564042", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3564042", "title": "Madonna–whore complex", "text": "Madonna–whore complex\n\nIn psychoanalytic literature, a Madonna–whore complex is the inability to maintain sexual arousal within a committed, loving relationship. First identified by Sigmund Freud, under the rubric of \"psychic impotence\", this psychological complex is said to develop in men who see women as either saintly Madonnas or debased prostitutes. Men with this complex desire a sexual partner who has been degraded (the whore) while they cannot desire the respected partner (the Madonna). Freud wrote: \"Where such men love they have no desire and where they desire they cannot love.\" Clinical psychologist Uwe Hartmann, writing in 2009, stated that the complex \"is still highly prevalent in today's patients\".\n\nThe term is also used popularly, if sometimes with subtly different meanings.\n\nFreud argued that the Madonna–whore complex was caused by a split between the affectionate and the sexual currents in male desire. Oedipal and castration anxiety fears prohibit the affection felt for past incestuous objects from being attached to women who are sensually desired: \"The whole sphere of love in such persons remains divided in the two directions personified in art as sacred and profane (or animal) love\". In order to minimize anxiety, the man categorizes women into two groups: women he can admire and women he finds sexually attractive. Whereas the man loves women in the former category, he despises and devalues the latter group. Psychoanalyst Richard Tuch suggests that Freud offered at least one alternative explanation for the Madonna–whore complex: This earlier theory is based not on oedipal-based castration anxiety but on man's primary hatred of women, stimulated by the child's sense that he had been made to experience intolerable frustration and/or narcissistic injury at the hands of his mother. According to this theory, in adulthood the boy-turned-man seeks to avenge these mistreatments through sadistic attacks on women who are stand-ins for mother.\n\nIt is possible that such a split may be exacerbated when the sufferer is raised by a cold but overprotective mother – a lack of emotional nurturing paradoxically strengthening an incestuous tie. Such a man will often court someone with maternal qualities, hoping to fulfill a need for maternal intimacy unmet in childhood, only for a return of the repressed feelings surrounding the earlier relationship to prevent sexual satisfaction in the new.\n\nAnother theory claims that the Madonna–whore complex derives from the representations of women as either madonnas or whores in mythology and Judeo-Christian theology rather than developmental disabilities of individual men.\n\nNaomi Wolf considered that the sexual revolution had paradoxically intensified the importance of the virgin–whore split, leaving women to contend with the worst aspects of both images. Others consider that both men and women find integrating sensuality and an ideal femininity difficult to do within the same relationship.\n\n\n\n"}

It was designed and built in 1934 by Jim McGilvray and Harold Fife. It is also known as the Chaff cutting train. The property is owned by City of Wagga Wagga. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 December 2004.\n\nThe Cook's Galley was a mobile kitchen used to prepare food to feed the chaff cutting team owned and run by the Fife family during the 1930s and 1940s. Jim McGilvray (carpenter) and Harold Fife made it from recycled materials in 1934.\n\nIt consists of a carriage of four steel wheels with a drawbar for towing. The drawbar was attached to the back of a Roden or McClaren traction engine. On top of the carriage a rectangular cabin was fitted with two single full-length doors and a small window at one end. The kitchen contains a coal stove for cooking, a wooden cupboard for storage (below) and food preparation (above). Elsewhere in the kitchen are a number of wooden packing cases, food bins, cooking and eating utensils, fire tools and pitching forks. \n\nThe origins of this particular branch of the Fife family go back to William Fife (1802-1880) who lived on a moderate farm at Drumcullion, County Fermanagh, Ireland. All five surviving children of his first marriage to wife Bessie (nee Nixon 1807-1850) immigrated to New South Wales, Australia between 1859 and 1865. The aftermath of the potato famine, the death of their mother, their father remarrying and better prospects in an overseas colony were all contributing to factors to them leaving Ireland.\n\nThe Keenan family, their neighbours in Ireland, had a daughter in Goulburn, New South Wales, who agreed to sponsor the new migrants - Faithy (1836-1903), Nixon (1840-1916), John (1838-1874), George (1848-1916) and Eliza (1846-1939). Their ages on arrival were 23, 19, 24, 14 and 19 respectively. Harold's great grandfather, Nixon started work as a yardman in a hotel, then became a carrier driving a bullock team between Sydney and Cooma. Later he bought and worked land in the vicinity of Goulburn. He married Elizabeth Cole (1849-1879) in 1870 who bore him six children.\n\nHarold's grandfather, William (1871-1956), the eldest son of Nixon, was the first of the family to operate a chaff cutting business. He also bred horses, worked as a railway line contractor during lean times, and a farmer in later life. He suffered the unfortunate accident of having his left foot crushed by the Buffalo Pitts Traction engine which drove his chaff cutting plant. He married Mary Jane Whittaker (1874-1904) in 1896 and they had two sons William Clyde (1897-1971) and James Nixon (1898-1972), Harold's father and uncle respectively who played a major role in the family's chaff cutting, produce store and bakery businesses in Wagga Wagga.\n\nIt was while working on his father's (William's Snr) chaff cutting plant at Sherwin's Flat, Tarago, that Harolds' father met his future wife, and Harold's mother, Myrtle Wyatt.\n\nIn about 1919 Harold's father, William Clyde, moved to Wagga Wagga to work for Les Howard who operated a chaff cutting plant. (Howard also originated from Goulburn). He was paid one shilling per ton and had an average weekly wage of 2 pounds 8 shillings. James Nixon (1898-1972), William's younger brother and Harold's uncle, joined him. Initially they camped in the Jockey's Room at the pony racecourse where Norton Street is now located and on the site which in years to come would house their Chaff Mill and Bulk Store.\n\nHarold and his mother joined his father and uncle in Wagga and with good prospects in the chaff industry persuaded their Uncle Tom, who lived in Goulburn, to purchase Les Howard's chaff cutting plant. For a number of years they worked for Uncle Tom before buying the plant from him and establishing Fife Bros in 1925. Tom Fife still lived in Goulburn so the sale to his nephews suited him. For almost three decades the family business travelled rural New South Wales cutting hay under contract to James Dunn Ltd., Stockman and Kleinig & Co., Kerridge & McMahon Ltd., and E.D. McMahon & Co.\n\nChaff cutting at the time was a huge industry as motor trucks were only starting to become widespead and there were big markets for chaff in Sydney, in the coal fields of New South Wales and Roma Street, Brisbane. In these centres household deliveries were still done by horse drawn vehicles and as the mines were not fully mechanised pit ponies were still in use. With increasing prosperity the family bought their first of three Cliff and Bunting chaff cutters in 1927 and featured it at the Wagga Wagga Show.\n\nTheir first vehicle was a Model T Ford which Clyde used in the evenings, after completing his daily stint on the plant, to travel between plants to deliver spare parts, bags, provisions and meat. A Chevrolet Utility was purchased from Minty's Dealership, Wagga Wagga in 1927.\n\nCrop failures, labour strikes and the depression brought difficult times and the chaff cutting plant stood in the backyard of the family's No.9 Shaw Street home for many years. During these tough times Harold's father took labouring work on the roads with the Wagga Wagga Municipal Council and as a fettler with the New South Wales Railways. His mother collected the fat from the Galley and made it into soap and also sold it to the soap works in town to earn much needed income. Around 1940 the brothers purchased the Swan Bakery and soon owned and operated four shops drawing on the labour of various family members.\n\nIrene Wealand, Harold's aunt, remembers his mother making attractive and warm Wagga rugs from chaff bags for the household beds. The chaff bags were opened and filled with old woollen garments, sandwiched together sewn together and then covered with a heavy patterned material.\n\nIn 1949 the brothers dissolved their business partnership. Harold and his father held onto the chaff cutting plant and the produce store, which had been established in 1945, at 45 Baylis Street, while his uncle (James) took over the two bakehouses and four retail outlets and formed J. N. Fife and Sons with his boys, Ken and Edgar (Ned). The business was expanded with new partners and later known as the Riverina Baking Co. A large bakehouse was built in Edward Street behind the Wagga Flour Mill. A chaff mill was established at The Rock in 1945. This was a result of criticism levelled at the chaff cutters whose machinery due to their heavy steel wheels damaged the roads. A second mill was established at a site in Norton Street which lasted for about five years as difficulties were still experienced with transporting hay from the farms to the mill the authorities been particularly strict on over wide loading. The focus of the business shifted to the produce store and fertiliser.\n\nAt the age of thirteen Harold joined his father in the chaff cutting plant. In his father's words, If he won't go to school, he might as well go to work! Harold started as a lunch boy and by his fourteenth birthday had moved to the chaff cutter been taught the ropes by the older men. At the age of eighteen (1937) a second plant was purchased and Harold put in charge. The plant was in Blayney when news of the outbreak of the World War II was made known. Harold enlisted and served for three years. In 1944 he was discharged under the Manpower Act and returned to the cutter. In later years he followed in the footsteps of his father and became a City Councillor and a Deputy Mayor of Wagga Wagga both serving for a period of 21 years. Harold's younger brother Wallace Clyde Fife (1929- ) went into politics and became the Member for Farrer.\n\nHarold's uncle, James, was badly burnt, in 1939, when the steam box exploded he was working on. Painted with Gentian Violet he spent many weeks recuperating at home.\n\nChaff, as petrol is today, was a much-needed fuel when the horse was the primary source of power and transport on Riverina farms between the late 19th century and the end of Second World War. Horse numbers reached their peak in 1919 when there were two million horses in Australia - one horse for every two head of population. Over the next three decades the tractor gradually replaced them. To maintain their health and strength working horses needed to be fed three times per day. The most convenient form of fed was to cut hay into chaff and then mix it with other grains such as oats. One horse consumed about of feed per year. As a result most farmers kept a proportion of their crops for feed which would amount to per annum if they had two 8-horse teams. Others are known to have cut more than a year.\n\nChaff was also stocked piled for periods of drought and used to feed cattle and sheep as well as horses. Additional demands for chaff came from teamsters and townspeople that used horses for transport. As a result of these demands for horse feed chaff cutting became a profitable business with a number of firms, of which the Fife brothers were one, operating in the Riverina.\n\nThe hay season usually stretched from early November until the end of January the following year. With the use of binders, pulled by three horses, the hay was cut, tied into sheaves, and bundles of about ten sheaves, tied together to form a stook and left to dry. The stooks were then collected and carted to a site for the building of a haystack. Chaff cutting teams cut the hay into chaff either directly from the stooks in the paddock or from the haystacks. The Fife family plant consisted of a Roden or McLaren 8 horse power, two-cylinder traction engine, cook's galley, cliff and bunting chaff cutter, dobbin (or wagon), steam box, and water cart.\n\nLinked together in this order they formed a train which moved from one farm to another around the district. On arriving at a farm the plant was set up next to the haystack(s). The farmer had to supply the wood and water for the steam traction engine which had a capacity of 300 gallons. Up to four Furphy carts of water were used per day. The ratio of wood needed per ton of chaff cut was of wood for one tonne of chaff. The wood was cut to lengths for feeding into the furnace.\n\nStackmen, armed with pitching forks, passed the sheaves to a man at the steam box who cut the twine holding them together and feed the loose hay, with the help of a conveying mechanism, through the steam box long and wide. Steaming the hay before it was cut prevented it from breaking and greatly improved its quality. The steam was supplied from the steam engine through a pipe. When the hay reached the Chaff Cutter it was fed through a pair of rollers and cut. The cut hay fell onto a type of sieve, called a riddle board, which fed it onto an elevator taking it to a double chute of bagging cylinders. Long pieces of uncut hay fell onto a caving elevator which took it back through the cutters.\n\nThere were two bag sewers who in turn filled and sewed alternate bags. The machine would cut 1 or 2 bags of chaff per minute which after been sewn up were loaded straight onto a truck which depending on its size was allowed to carry 152, 184 or 220 bags. The blades of the cutter had to be sharpened or replaced at regular intervals and Harold prides himself at been able to change and set six knives within three minutes.\n\nThe traction engine supplied the steam box with steam as well as the power for driving the cutter. The pulley belt turning the drive wheels was long and wide and made of a compound of two or three ply leather sewn together with copper rivets. It cost A£100 (a pound a foot). It also generated a considerable amount of static electricity which made ones hair stand upright if you stood beneath it. The dobbin was either a three wheel or four-wheel cart used to carry new bags, tarpaulins, sleeping equipment and spare parts. A horse drawn Furphy Cart was used to bring dam water to the engine for steaming purposes.\n\nDrinking water and water used for cooking was stored in a tank and two drums were brought separately to the galley by Clyde Fife. The tank and drums were placed at the back of the galley.\n\nTime spent on a farm varied from as short as a day to a week. On average the plant cut a day but they could reach if pushed to the limit.\n\nThe normal routine was an eleven hour day, starting at 7:00am, stopping for a short smoke break at 9:00am, dinner between 12 noon and 1:00pm, a ten minute tea break at 3:00pm and calling it a day around 6:00pm. The business operated for all but two weeks in the year and in good times the Fife family owned and operated two plants.\n\nThe routine of the cook was as follows: The wood stove was fired at 5:45am for a 6:30am breakfast to facilitate a 7:00am start. Because of the heavy labour involved breakfast consisted of one pound of sausage per man with toast and tea. Dinner consisted of roast meat, potatoes, carrots, parsnips and turnips with a sweet to end. The evening meal was usually cold meats and salads. Scones, jam tarts and biscuits were served during the mid-morning and mid-afternoon breaks. Tea appeared at all meals.\n\nWhen the chaff cutting plant was in full production sixteen men were fed from the galley. When out in the field provisions were usually delivered on a Monday supplemented with fresh bread and meat on a Wednesday due to the absence of refrigeration.\n\nRates of pay for the various labourers were as follows:\n\nIt consists of a carriage of four steel wheels with a drawbar for towing. The drawbar was attached to the back of a Roden or McClaren traction engine. On top of the carriage a rectangular cabin was fitted with two single full-length doors and a small window at one end. The kitchen contains a coal stove for cooking, a wooden cupboard for storage (below) and food preparation (above). Elsewhere in the kitchen are a number of wooden packing cases, food bins, cooking and eating utensils, fire tools and pitching forks.\n\nThe galley was built in 1935 and operated until 1954.\n\nAs at 22 October 2004, the item was intact and in a good, sound condition. With the exception of a number of new wooden planks on its rear platform, a material foot plate at its entrance, and a small number of nuts and bolts in the doors, it remains in original condition. This adds considerably to its value and importance as i's surfaces and feature retain their unique working characteristics.\n\nThe mobile galley is believed to be one of only two retained in NSW and has been retained substantially in its original built and used condition.\n\nAs at 14 June 2006, the Cook's Galley, as an element of the Fife family chaff cutting plant, was a significant item representing a historical phase of grain harvesting in the Riverina. It represents a period between the 1880s and 1940s that saw the dominance of horse-drawn power for rural farm operations and transport generally throughout NSW.\n\nChaff cutting provided fuel for horses which were the principle form of power and transport on farms and the cities during the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. They pulled the drays, wagons or a variety implements for the sowing, harvesting or transporting of wheat, machinery, for mining operations, and delivery of other produce.\n\nWith the rest of the chaff cutting plant having been broken up, the Cook's Galley remains a tangible example of the Fife chaff cutting business and about the men who worked this and similar machines on a number of farms in rural New South Wales. The family, great grandchildren and grandchildren of Irish migrants, contributed to the rural economy and political life of the Riverina.\n\nThe item retains a high level of integrity and significant display and educational roles.\n\nMobile Cook's Galley, Museum of the Riverina was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 December 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nThe Cook's Galley was part of a larger chaff cutting plant owned and operated by the local Wagga Wagga Fife family. It represents a distinct stage in the NSW economy where horses played a seminal role in rural, manufacturing, mining and transport industries. In the days before motorised machinery such as tractors and lorries, securing chaff for horse feed was a critical task in servicing the State's animal labour force.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.\n\nThe Fife family chaff cutting \"trains\", that included a mobile cook's galley, played an important role in the harvesting of chaff for a thirty year period. The teams were a common fixture on rural properties throughout the Riverina, Central West and North West of NSW.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nThe Mobile Galley was an element in a travelling \"train\" that comprised a steam-powered traction engine that towed the kitchen, a chaff cutting machine, a dobbin (wagon), a steam box and a water cart. Collectively, the \"train\" showed a marked level of local ingenuity in the adaptation of existing vehicle types for a specific rural technological need. The mobile galley was hand built from an original stone wagon, with the introduction of a cabin area fitted out specifically to cook and store food in remote farm areas. It had to be self-contained and provide 3+ meals a day for periods extending up to seven days. While subject to harsh conditions, the survival of the vehicle in a near-original form is testimony to the inventiveness and skills of its builders, Jim McGilvray (carpenter) and Harold Fife of Wagga.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nOriginating from Ireland and settling in Goulburn between 1859 and 1865, the Fife family remain a prominent family in the Riverina district. The Fife Brothers company was formed in Wagga during 1925, although family members had already settled and been working in the chaff industry there. The successful family business operated throughout NSW for some thirty years, surviving the Depression years and World War Two. The family diversified into chaff mill, bakery and produce areas, and several members played prominent roles in local and Federal politics.\n\nLife in the chaff cutting industry involved long hard labour, and the provision of meals and refreshments through the mobile 'canteen's' played an important social role in the servicing and support of the local labour market.\n\nThe galley's integrity and retention by the original family which built and operated the vehicle contributes to its social significance values.\n\nThe place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe Cook's Galley and original chaff cutting \"train\" has been effectively researched and interpreted and it is unlikely that significant new insights will be documented regarding its impact on past farming and agricultural practices.\n\nThe place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.\n\nThe Cook's Galley is unique in NSW being one of only two known retained examples of a mobile farm kitchen and retains a high level of integrity. Now a fixture of the respected Museum of the Riverina, the Cook's Galley offers a unique opportunity to examine a past, defunct, way of rural life - the harvesting of chaff to provide feed for the working horse population of NSW. The importance of this industry is identified with the State's horse population of 1919 being 2.5 million - one for every two people in the State. With the widespread introduction of mechanized machinery on the farm, particularly following World War Two, the chaff industry was lost to the tide of petroleum and other fuel needs.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.\n\nThe mobile cook's galley is today representative of a once commonplace rural activity in the grain harvesting areas of NSW. The growing, cutting, storage and processing of grains for chaff, supplied necessary horse feed and stock food reserves. The industry therefore played a significant underlying role in the development and support of the State's rural and general economies at a time that depended on horse-drawn power for many sectors of industry.\n"}

It is located in the historic Glendower Street neighbourhood, within the medieval town walls. In March 2012, it was announced that the Monmouth Police Station was one of seventeen police stations in South East Wales that would no longer be open to the public.\n\nBefore 1881, the town of Monmouth maintained and staffed its own police station. Monmouthshire County assumed control of Monmouth for policing in 1881, and Monmouth eliminated its own police force. The county rented a building in Agincourt Street as a police station. In 1895, the Monmouthshire County Council purchased a building in Glendower Street, and redeveloped it as a police station. The Agincourt Street facility was no longer needed.\n\nKelly's Directory of Monmouthshire indicates that, in 1901, the Monmouth Police Station on Glendower Street was staffed by Captain Vincent E. Parker, \"Superintendent of the Borough County Constabulary,\" as well as two sergeants and seven constables. Police Superintendent Parker did not live at the police station; rather, he resided in the Overmonnow area with his family. Ten years earlier, the native of France had been Superintendent of Police in Tredegar, Monmouthshire. While Parker did not reside at the station in 1901, other members of the police force did call it (or the building to the right of it) home. Police Sergeant John Tucker resided at 13 A Glendower Street with his family. Police constable James Collins boarded there as well.\n\nIn 1911, the address of the Monmouth Police Station was recorded as 15 Glendower Street. The station was the residence of Police Sergeant Charles Jones, a native of Herefordshire, and his family. Constables Albert Jenkins and Frederick Dries, of Monmouthshire and Middlesex respectively, boarded there as well. Police Sergeant Jones had lived on Hereford Road in 1901. William Bullock was Superintendent of Police in 1923. His title was \"Superintendent of the County and Borough Constabulary.\" Two sergeants and six constables were also at Glendower Street.\n\nThe Monmouth Police Station at 19 Glendower Street is a mid 19th-century, listed building. It is located within the medieval walls of the town, built around 1300. The main building is three storeys with a four-bay elevation, and there is a two-storey extension to the right with a three-bay elevation. The exterior is stucco and there is a hipped tile roof. Glendower Street, the site of the Monmouth Police Station since 1895, has been partially renumbered since the early 20th century. In 1901, the station (or the building housing some of the police staff) was documented at 13A Glendower Street, the record immediately next to that for the Druid's Head Inn at 19 Glendower Street. In 1911, the station was at 15 Glendower Street. Decades later, at the time of the heritage listings, at least a portion of the police building was recorded at 17 Glendower Street.\n\nThere is a separate Coflein listing at 19 Glendower Street. It describes an old pub with a two-storey, two-bay elevation and a roughcast exterior. This is a reference to the Druid's Head Inn, to the immediate left (southeast) of the police station. It was the public house that had the 19 Glendower Street address for much of the 19th and 20th centuries. The Monmouth Police Station was grade II listed on 15 August 1974. The fencing and gate behind 17 Glendower Street, also part of the station, are adjacent to those of the Henry Burton Court residences and are positioned in front of Chippenham Park. They were grade II listed on 8 October 2005.\n\nThe building not only houses the local police, it also serves as a response center for the Gwent Police. The Gwent Police are responsible for an area of approximately 600 square miles. The Monmouth Police Station was one of the Monmouth facilities that welcomed visitors in September 2011 during Open Doors 2011, European Heritage Days in Wales. The event was put together by the Monmouth Civic Society and the Civic Trust for Wales. On 31 May 2012, the Gwent Police announced that the next Monmouth Off Street Project (MOSP) event had been scheduled for 24 June 2012. The MOSP began in 2009 in response to the perceived increase in anti-social behaviour of Monmouth youths. When queried, local children had noted the lack of youth facilities in the Monmouth area and had suggested a new skate park. The MOSP team meets regularly and plans fundraising activities to finance the skate park, with the event scheduled for June 2012 a zip line in Chepstow.\n\nOn 13 March 2012, the \"BBC News\" reported that as of July of that year, seventeen police stations in South East Wales would close to the public, with only five still offering front desk service. The closures were reported to be undertaken as part of a program of cost-saving measures at Gwent Police. The Monmouth Police Station was one of the buildings that would no longer be open to the public.\n\nGlendower Street, Monmouth\n\n"}

The location of artifacts in the stratigraphic column suggests that, originally, the site was not occupied year-round, and that during the last glacial period people would have been travelling back and forth between North America and Russia, using this site as an outpost. Zooarchaeological evidence, such as mammoth and sheep bones, suggest that people were following these paths seasonally for hunting. As the ice age ended, the site would have become a more permanent residence. Points found here suggest that the culture is ancestral to that which created the Clovis points, of which variations can be found across the United States.\n\n"}

It was a traditional feature of Fourth of July parades in parts of the United States in the 19th century, and \"Horribles Parades\" continue to be part of the Independence Day celebration in several New England communities. A 1926 newspaper article about July the Fourth celebrations in the White Mountains of New Hampshire notes:\nOld-time celebrations are to be held tomorrow at Littleton, Lancaster, Colebrook, and Conway, with all the usual features of street parades of horribles and grotesques, brass bands, decorated automobiles and vehicles, exhibitions by fire departments, basket picnics in convenient groves...\nFounded in 1926, the Ancient and Horribles Parade in Chepachet, Rhode Island continues this tradition.\n\nOther rural New England towns, such as Hopkinton, Massachusetts and Mendon, Massachusetts still hold annual Horribles Parades.\n\nA parade of horribles is also a rhetorical device whereby the speaker argues against taking a certain course of action by listing a number of extremely undesirable events which will ostensibly result from the action. Its power lies in the emotional impact of the unpleasant predictions; however, a parade of horribles can potentially be a fallacy if one or more of the following is true:\n\nA parade of horribles is a type of hyperbole, because it exaggerates the negative results of the action, arguing that \"If we do this, ultimately all these horrible things will happen\".\n\n"}

It was historically spoken by the Pottawatomi people who lived around the Great Lakes in what are now Michigan and Wisconsin in the United States, and in southern Ontario in Canada. Federally recognized tribes in Michigan and Oklahoma are working to revive the language.\n\nCecilia Miksekwe Jackson, one of the last surviving native speakers of Potawatomi, died in May 2011, at the age of 88. She was known for working to preserve and teach the language. \n\nThe federally recognized Pokégnek Bodéwadmik Pokagon Band of Potawatomi started a master-apprentice program in which a \"language student (the language apprentice) will be paired with fluent Potawatomi speakers (the language masters)\" in January 2013. In addition, classes in the Potowatomi language are available, including those at the Hannahville summer immersion camp, with webcast instruction and videoconferencing.\n\nPotawatomi is a member of the Algonquian language family (itself a member of the larger Algic stock). It is usually classified as a Central Algonquian language, with languages such as Ojibwe, Cree, Menominee, Miami-Illinois, Shawnee and Fox. The label \"Central Algonquian\" signifies a geographic grouping rather than the group of languages descended from a common ancestor language within the Algonquian family. Of the Central languages, Potawatomi is most similar to Ojibwe, but it also has borrowed a considerable amount of vocabulary from the Sauk.\n\nGenerally, in developments since Indian Removal in the 19th century, Potawatomi has become differentiated in North America among separated populations. It is divided between Northern Potawatomi, spoken in Ontario, Canada; and Michigan and Wisconsin of the United States; and Southern Potawatomi, which is spoken in Kansas and Oklahoma, where certain Pottawatomi ancestors were removed who had formerly lived in Illinois and other areas east of the Mississippi River.\n\nThough no standard orthography has been agreed upon by the Potawatomi communities, the system most commonly used is the \"Pedagogical System\" developed by the Wisconsin Native American Languages Program (WNALP). As the name suggests, it was designed to be used in language teaching. The system is based on the Roman alphabet and is phonemic, with each letter or digraph representing a contrastive sound. The letters used are a b ch d e é g ' h i j k m n o p s sh t w y z zh.\n\nIn Kansas, a different system called BWAKA is used. It too is both based on the Roman alphabet and phonemic, with each letter or digraph representing a contrastive sound. The letters used are ' a b c d e e' g h i I j k m n o p s sh t u w y z zh.\n\nThe traditional system used in writing Potawatomi is a form of syllabic writing. Potawatomi, Ottawa, Sac, Fox and Winnebago communities all used it. Derived from the Roman alphabet, it resembles handwritten Roman text. However, unlike the Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics or the Cherokee alphabet, it has not yet been incorporated into the Unicode standards.\n\nEach Potawatomi syllabic block in the system has at least 2 of the 17 alphabetic letters, which consist of 13 consonants and 4 vowels. Of the 13 phonemic consonantal letters, the /h/, written , is optional.\n\nHere, the phonology of the Northern dialect is described, which differs somewhat from that of the Southern dialect, spoken in Kansas.\n\nThere are 5 vowel phonemes, 4 diphthongs, and 19 consonant phonemes.\n\n, which is often written as , represents an open-mid front unrounded vowel, . represents the schwa, , which has several allophonic variants. Before /n/, it becomes ; before /k/, it becomes or ; and word-finally, it becomes .\n\nObstruents, as in many other Algonquian languages, do not have a voicing distinction \"per se\" but what is better termed a \"strong\"/\"weak\" distinction. \"Strong\" consonants, written as voiceless (), are always voiceless, often aspirated, and longer in duration than the \"weak\" consonants, which are written as voiced () and are often voiced and are not aspirated. Nasals before another consonant become syllabic, and /t/, /d/, and /n/ are dental: .\n\nPotawatomi has six parts of speech: noun, verb, pronoun, prenoun, preverb, and particle.\n\nThere are two main types of pronoun: personal pronouns and demonstrative pronouns. As nouns and verbs use inflection to describe anaphoric reference, the main use of the free pronouns is for emphasis.\n\nPotawatomi Personal Pronouns, due to vowel syncope, resemble Odaawaa, but structurally they resemble closer to the Personal Pronouns used by the Swampy Cree language:\n\nThe relatively-recent split from Ojibwe makes Potawatomi still exhibit strong correspondences, especifically with the \"Odaawaa\" (Ottawa) dialect.\n\n\n"}

The idea of \"kanun\" first entered the Muslim World in the thirteenth century, as it was borrowed from the Mongol Empire in the aftermath of their invasions. The 10th sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Suleiman was known in the Ottoman Empire as Suleiman Kanuni (\"the Lawgiver\"), due to his code of laws. \n\nAfter the fall of the Abbasid Caliphate in 1258, a practice known to the Turks and Mongols transformed itself into qanun, which gave power to caliphs, governors, and sultans alike to \"make their own regulations for activities not addressed by the sharia.\" This became increasingly important as the Middle East started to modernize, thus running into the problems of a modern state, which were not covered by sharia. The Qanun began to unfold as early as Umar I (586–644 CE). Many of the regulations covered by qanun were based on financial matters or tax systems adapted through the law and regulations of those territories Islam conquered.\n\nThe term ḳānūn derives itself from the Greek word κανών. Originally having the less abstract meaning of “any straight rod” it then later referred to any “measure or rule” in Greek. The word was then translated into and adopted by the Arabic language after the Ottoman Empire’s conquest of Egypt under Sultan Selim I (ca. 1516). In the Ottoman empire, the term ḳānūn still carried the word’s original meanings of a system of tax regulation. However, it later came to also refer to “code of regulations” or “state law”, a well-defined secular distinction to “Muslim law” known as the s̲h̲arīʿa. The ḳānūn took on significant importance during the period of modernization in the Ottoman Empire. The ḳānūn and s̲h̲arīʿa did not contradict each other concerning administrative matters, and therefore the ḳānūn was assimilated easily into Ottoman regulatory functions. The ḳānūn promulgated by Ottoman sultans also came to be used for financial and penal law. Under Sultan Mehmed II (1451-1481) the ḳānūn continued to be strictly applied for these practices. However due to the influence of Abu ʾl-Suʿūd, grand muftī of Istanbul from 1545 to 1574 the ḳānūn was applied to deal with matters concerning property rights as well. Previously, property rights were exclusively under the jurisdiction of the s̲h̲arīʿa. Despite this seeming contradiction, due to skillful bureaucratic operations, the ḳānūn and the s̲h̲arīʿa existed harmoniously. The ḳānūn has retained its relevance in the Middle East regarding civil, commercial, administrative, and penal laws that were inspired by originally Western legislation. It also has an influence in the ways that provisions of the s̲h̲arīʿa are reproduced.\n\n"}

{"id": "5948266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5948266", "title": "Secondary products revolution", "text": "Secondary products revolution\n\nAndrew Sherratt's model of a secondary products revolution involved a widespread and broadly contemporaneous set of innovations in Old World farming. The use of domestic animals for primary carcass products (meat) was broadened from the 4th-3rd millennia BCE (c. Middle Chalcolithic) to include exploitation for renewable 'secondary' products: milk, wool, traction (the use of animals to drag ploughs in agriculture), riding and pack transport.\n\nThe SPR model incorporates two key elements:\nMany of these innovations first appeared in the Near East during the fourth millennium BCE and spread to Europe and the rest of Asia soon afterwards. They appeared in Europe by the beginning of the third millennium BCE. These innovations became available in Europe due to the westwards diffusion of new species (horse, donkey), breeds (e.g. woolly sheep), technology (wheel, ard) and technological knowledge (e.g. ploughing). Their adoption can be understood in terms of pastoralism, plough agriculture and animal-based transport facilitating marginal agricultural colonisation and settlement nucleation. Ultimately it was revolutionary in terms of both origins and consequences. \n\nHowever, both the dating and significance of the archaeological evidence cited by Sherratt (and thus the validity of the model) have been questioned by several archaeologists. The dangers of dating the innovations on the basis of evidence such as iconography and waterlogged organic remains with restricted chronological and geographical availability have been pointed out. Sherratt has himself acknowledged that such dates provide a \"terminus ante quem\" for the invention of milking and ploughing.\n\nDirect evidence for how domestic animals were exploited in later prehistoric Europe has grown substantially, in quantity and diversity, since 1981. Initially the concepts of the SPR were tested by analysing the appearance of certain artefact types (e.g. ploughs, wheeled vehicles). By the middle 1980s the most common means of testing the model derived from the more ubiquitous faunal (zooarchaeological) assemblages, through which mortality patterns, herd management and traction-related arthropathies were utilized to confirm or reject the SPR model. Many zooarchaeological studies in both the Near East and Europe have confirmed the veracity of the model.\nHowever the detection of milk residues in ceramic vessels is now considered the most promising means of detecting the origins of milking. Discovery of such residues has pushed back the earliest date for milking into the Neolithic. A study of more than 2,200 pottery vessels from sites in the Near East and Southeastern Europe indicated that milking had its origins in northwestern Anatolia. The lowland, coastal region around the Sea of Marmara favoured cattle-keeping. Pottery from these sites dating from 6500–5000 BCE showed milk being processed into dairy products. Milk residues had already been found in vessels from the British Neolithic, but farming arrived in Britain late (c. 4000 BCE).\n\nThe seeming contradiction between the zooarchaeological and residue studies appears to be a matter of scale. The residues indicate that milking may have played a role in domestic animal exploitation from the later Neolithic. The zooarchaeological studies indicate that there was a massive change in the scale of such production strategies during the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age.\n"}

Some venues issue standing-room-only (or SRO) tickets for a reduced cost since it can become uncomfortable to stand through the course of an event. However, some fans prefer standing-room-only tickets as the crowds that gather can be more active than people who are sitting down for much of the event.\n\nFor example, standing-room only areas known as terraces are very common at football matches around the globe and tickets sold as standing area tickets are sometimes the most popular; i.e., they are not sold merely when all seating tickets have been sold out. However, the periodic occurrence of tragedies related to standing room only areas at football matches such as at Hillsborough and Guatemala City have led to calls to eliminate such arrangements. In England, standing room, once a staple of most football stadiums there, has been practically eliminated at the highest level; all of the major stadiums have been refurbished as all-seaters. There is a now move towards the provision of safe standing areas, providing bolt-on, fold-away or rail seats. \n\nBy contrast, standing room tickets are rare at major sports stadiums in the United States and Canada, with only the Dallas Cowboys' AT&T Stadium, the Washington Redskins FedExField and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats Tim Hortons Field having such permanent arrangements, though they are usually marketed as part of a 'party deck' where the price of a ticket may come with food and drink along with obstructed picnic table-style seating, and with other amenities to encourage fans to purchase those tickets. The Green Bay Packers have also tested out the standing room concept in 2014 in a select section after the completion of renovations at Lambeau Field. The Little League World Series utilizes standing room and berm seating at its events, with its flagship venue, Howard J. Lamade Stadium, able to accommodate 12 times as many spectators on its berms (over 40,000) than it does in the 3,300-seat ballpark proper.\n\nStanding tickets are a key feature of the annual London concert season The Proms, with up to 1,350 \"Promenaders\" buying cheaper tickets to stand in unreserved space in the arena and gallery of the Royal Albert Hall.\n"}

The book is credited with popularizing the political culture sub-field and is considered to be the first systematic study in this field.\n\nIn the text Almond and Verba examine the democratic systems in five countries, the United States, Germany, Mexico, Italy, and the United Kingdom. They interviewed about a thousand individuals in each country on their views of government and political life. As they define it, the \"civic culture\" (singular) is \"based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that [permits] change but [moderates] it\" (Almond and Verba 1963, 8). They identify three political structures: participant, subject, and parochial. They consider political culture to be the element that connects individual attitudes with the overall political system structure.\n\nAlmond and Verba considered the Italian emphasis on the family as the driving main force for society as \"amoral\" (in the words of Edward Banfield (\"The Moral Basis of a Backward Society\", 1958), or \"exclusive\", and believed that such a culture would impede the culture's potential for developing a \"sense of community and civic culture,\" which they saw as a necessary background for \"effective democracy\".\n\nSeymour Lipset wrote in \"The Democratic Century\" that Almond and Verba \"did argue persuasively that the extent of civic culture could be predicted by structural and historical factors\" but that there was also \"strong evidence that some aspects of the civic culture were powerfully associated with education levels, across national borders\".\n\n\"The Civic Culture\" was criticized for having an \"Anglo-American bias\", with the authors stating that only the United Kingdom and the United States possessed the capability for long term democratic stabilization. Critics also expressed skepticism over the accuracy of depicting a culture based upon individual interviews and that the approach was \"ethnocentric and more prescriptive than objective and empirical\".\n"}

Before the show and during the interval people wrote down their ideas for policies, with help from the campaign group NO2ID. Thomas would then go through the policies, deciding which ones would be considered for the manifesto and which ones should be immediately rejected. At the end of the show, the public were asked to vote for the best policy by shouting out loudly in support of the policies, the winning one being formed as part of the manifesto.\n\nThomas said in an interview with \"The List\": \"People innately have lots of solutions.

It was succeeded by the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture.\n\nAs the name implies, the Tumulus culture is distinguished by the practice of burying the dead beneath burial mounds (tumuli or kurgans).\n\nIn 1902, Paul Reinecke distinguished a number of cultural horizons based on research of Bronze Age hoards and tumuli in periods covered by these cultural horizons are shown in the table below. The Tumulus culture was prevalent during the Bronze Age periods B, C1, and C2. Tumuli have been used elsewhere in Europe from the Stone Age to the Iron Age; the term \"Tumulus culture\" specifically refers to the South German variant of the Bronze Age. In the table, Ha designates Hallstatt. Archaeological horizons Hallstatt A–B are part of the Bronze Age Urnfield culture, while horizons Hallstatt C–D are the type site for the Iron Age Hallstatt culture.\n\nThe Tumulus culture was eminently a warrior society which expanded with new chiefdoms eastward into the Carpathian Basin (up to the river Tisza), and northward into Polish and central European Únětice territories, with dispersed settlements centred in fortified structures. Some scholars see Tumulus groups from southern Germany in this context as corresponding to a community that shared an extinct Indo-European linguistic entity, such as the hypothetical Italo-Celtic group that was ancestral to Italic and Celtic. This particular hypothesis, however, conflicts with suggestions by other Indo-Europeanists. For instance, David W. Anthony suggests that Proto-Italic (and perhaps also Proto-Celtic) speakers could have entered northern Italy at an earlier stage, from the east (e.g., the Balkan/Adriatic region).\n\n\n\n"}

Though frequently referred to as an author of science fiction, critics have described her work as being difficult to classify.\n\nLe Guin came to critical attention with the publication of \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" in 1968, and \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" in 1969. The Earthsea books, of which \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" was the first, have been described as Le Guin's best work by several commentators, while scholar Charlotte Spivack described \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" as having established Le Guin's reputation as a writer of science fiction. Literary critic Harold Bloom referred to the books as Le Guin's masterpieces. Several scholars have called the Earthsea books Le Guin's best work. Her work has received intense critical attention. As of 1999, ten volumes of literary criticism and forty dissertations had been written about her work: she was referred to by scholar Donna White as a \"major figure in American letters\". Her awards include the National Book Award, the Newbery Medal, and multiple Hugo and Nebula Awards.

{"id": "220011", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220011", "title": "West American Digest System", "text": "West American Digest System\n\nThe West American Digest System is a system of identifying points of law from reported cases and organizing them by topic and key number. The system was developed by West Publishing to organize the entire body of American law. This extensive taxonomy makes the process of doing case law legal research less time consuming as it directs the researcher to cases that are similar to the legal issue under consideration.\n\nThe problem of finding cases on a particular topic was a large problem for the rapidly growing American legal system of the 19th century. John B. West, the founder of West Publishing, described this problem in his article \"A multiplicity of reports\". To solve the problem, he developed a system with two major parts. First, his company published cases in many American jurisdictions in bound volumes called reporters (the West National Reporter System now covers all state and federal courts). Second, he put together a classification system in which he divided the law into major categories which he called topics (such as \"Contracts\"). He then created hundreds of subcategories. To save space in printing, these were given a number called a key number. He then applied this \"topic and key number\" system to the cases he published. The key number is identified in the books with a key number and a key symbol graphic.\n\nEach case published in a West reporter is evaluated by an editor who identifies the points of law cited or explained in the case. The editor places the summaries of the points of law covered in the case at the beginning of the case. These summaries are usually a paragraph long, and are called headnotes. Each headnote is then assigned a topic and key number. The headnotes are arranged according to their topic and key number in multi-volume sets of books called Digests. A digest serves as a subject index to the case law published in West reporters. Headnotes are merely editorial guides to the points of law discussed or used in the cases, and the headnotes themselves are not legal authority.\n\nWest publishes \"West's Analysis of American Law\", which is a complete guide to the topic and key number system, and it is revised periodically.\n\nIn print, a digest works like an encyclopedia, in that the topics are listed in alphabetical order and printed on the spines. The \"Descriptive Word Index\" provides guidance as to the proper topics and key numbers.\n\nThe digest system includes digests for the individual states (except for Delaware, Nevada and Utah). The U.S. Supreme Court, Bankruptcy Courts, Federal Claims Court, and military courts each have an individual digest, as well as their decisions being included in the Federal Practice Digest with the notes of decisions from the federal District Courts and Courts of Appeals. Digests are also published for West's National Reporter System. Specialty subject digests exist, such as the Education Law Digest, and the Social Security Digest.\n\nFor nationwide research, about once a month, West publishes a General Digest volume, which incorporates classified digest notes from all reporters of the West National Reporter System. These are then cumulated into a Decennial Digest. Decennial implies that this occurs every ten years, but in the past several decades, there have been Decennial Digest Parts I and II (the 11th Series now has Part III ), so the cumulation is now more frequent. However, the various Decennial Digests are not cumulated. Thus, completing such a search over several decades requires consulting the Decennial Digests, and then updating that work with the most recent series of the General Digest.\n\nSome of the state and topical digests are revised to include the first cases in the jurisdiction, while the spines of the books of some of the other digests indicate that they are from \"1933 to date,\" for instance, indicating that one must consult a prior series for references to earlier cases. The state, federal, regional, and topical digests are updated by interim pamphlets, pocket parts, replacement volumes, or a new series.\n\nResearchers can also search the digest electronically using Westlaw:\n\nMost secondary sources published by Thomson West, such as Corpus Juris Secundum and American Jurisprudence, also have key number hyperlinks in their on-line Westlaw versions.\n\nThe \"Key Numbers and Digest\" feature and the hyperlinks create a \"Custom Digest.\"\n\nThe Custom Digest allows:\n\nSelecting key numbers and jurisdictions in the \"Key Number Search Tool\" results in a similar display of digest headnotes.\nSince all West headnote annotations are merged on Westlaw into a single database from which each Custom Digest is generated, there is no need to consult each separate series of the hard copy Decennial Digest. Full text of the cases may be accessed from the Custom Digest by clicking on the underlined case citation. The key number search or KeySearch will retrieve entire cases from a case law database.\n\nOther digest systems exist, including Butterworth's Digest for the United Kingdom (also containing references to cases decided in other Commonwealth countries), the Canadian Abridgment, digests associated with official state reports, such as in California and Wisconsin, and digests associated with topical reporters, such as the Uniform Commercial Code Case Digest. Most of these use a topic and section format, while some, like the U.C.C. Case Digest, use a section format based on the statute or rules being annotated. The A.L.R. Digest, accompanying the American Law Reports, formerly had its own classification system, but was replaced in 2004 by \"West's American Law Reports Digest,\" which follows West's topic and key number system.\n\n\n"}
