According to a diplomatic note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Morocco, \"The official announcement on Friday of the unfortunate visit of His Majesty King Juan Carlos I, on 5 and 6 November to the two occupied cities of Ceuta and Melilla is a regrettable initiative, whatever are the motives and objectives.\"\n\nAfter reporting of calls of queries from the Ambassador, the Chief Moroccan Government Spokesperson said,\"The ball is in the countryside of Spain and we hope that that country takes into consideration the sentiments of the Moroccan people and the interest of bilateral ties and cooperation.\"\n\nThe royal visit occurred in the days set, registering an influx of thousands of citizens, who cheered the Kings in both Ceuta and Melilla. During those days continued statements against the visit were made by the Moroccan authorities. In this regard, the Prime Minister of Morocco, Abbas El Fassi, compared the situation in both cities with the Israeli occupation of Palestinian Territories and King Mohammed VI himself described the visit as an \"outdated and nostalgic act of a dark era.\" The Spanish government, just before the visit, and after the reporting of the Moroccan opposition, told through the Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega that the visit of the King of Spain was an act of 'institutional normality.\" Days later, at the initiative of certain groups in Morocco, some hundreds of people carried out protests in Tetuan, as well as front of the border with Ceuta and Melilla. Moroccan authority also discontinued high-level visits of Spanish authorities to their country.\n\nFinally, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain, Miguel Angel Moratinos, visited Rabat to meet his Moroccan counterpart, Taib Fassi Fihri on January 3, 2008, and presented him a personal letter from Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to King Mohamed VI, which advocated for closer relations between both countries. Four days later, the Moroccan Foreign Ministry announced the return of its ambassador to Madrid, thus terminating the conflict.\n\nOn October 30, the Government of Spain announced the visit of King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia to Ceuta and Melilla from 5 and 6 November. The day before, the Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, had told that fact to the opposition leader Mariano Rajoy during an official ceremony, which Rajoy welcomed.\n\nThe King of Spain had not visited Ceuta and Melilla in his reign. The most immediate antecedent of the stay of King Juan Carlos I in these cities dates back to 1970, when he undertook a visit to Ceuta in his capacity as Prince of Asturias on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Spanish Legion.\n\nThe last visit of a Head of State of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla was by king Alfonso XIII, who was last seen in 1927, and President of the Second Republic, Niceto Alcala Zamora, on 4 November 1933.\n\nThe king of Spain was scheduled to visit to the autonomous city of Melilla in 1997 on the occasion of the five hundredth anniversary of the founding of the city, but the pressure of the Moroccan authorities led to the cancellation of the visit.\n\nOn November 5, the King and the Queen of Spain stayed in Ceuta for five hours, where they spoke to the Assembly of the Autonomous City, where the monarch said that he \"had an pending commitment to Ceuta\". Neither the king nor the Minister of Public Administration who accompanied him, Elena Salgado, or any other Spanish authority made any mention of the situation in Morocco. The King was welcomed by 25,000 people.\n\nOn November 6, the king came to Melilla, in which the Spanish monarch intervened the Assembly. There he acknowledged the loyalty of Melillans to the Crown. He made specific reference to Morocco, but said that \"Spain through mutual respect cultivates relations of sincere friendship with its neighbors.\" The number of people who gathered to welcome the King was estimated at 30,000.\n\nA month before the announcement of the royal visit, the judge of the National Court of Spain, Baltasar Garzón, had opened a file to investigate an alleged genocide of Sahrawis by Morocco, accepting to process the lawsuit filed in 2006 by various associations defending human rights and relatives of prisoners and disappeared Saharawis, which accused 31 senior officials of Moroccan security. Morocco, meanwhile, was accused of siding with the positions of the Polisario Front. Moroccan spokesman said that \"it would be good that Judge Garzon deal a bit of respect for human rights in Tindouf.\" Among the accused were Driss Basri and former Interior Minister and General Housni Benslimane.\n\nAs stated by Yassine Mansouri, Foreign Secret Service Chief of Morocco, during a stay in Mallorca, the deterioration of relations is also related to the active position of the Spanish Government and local authorities to untie Muslim believers of Ceuta and the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Morocco; and to bet on movements like the Tablig (Congregation for the Propagation of Islam) or the Muslim Brotherhood. Mansouri informed this to Alberto Saiz, Director of National Intelligence of Spain.\n\nThe position was due to the wrath of King Mohamed VI, according to Mansouri, he remembered that Moroccan King is the \"Commander of the Faithful\" and many mosques in Ceuta had been attached to the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain (UCIDE) (36 of 40 Islamic communities of Ceuta). The image of the UCID leader in Ceuta, Laarbi Maateis, is associated with radical Islamist movements by Morocco. For his part, Laarbi Maateis denied any involvement with fundamentalist movements, indicating that no member of Tablig had ever been arrested or identified as a suspect in connection with jihadism. He also said the prosecution were not understandable \"because the Maliki rite is practiced both here and in the rest of Spain and Morocco and no one has tried to change that, especially because it seems to be the best for the city.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister of Morocco, Abbas El Fassi, reported the Moroccan parliament that his government would not spare efforts to regain the two cities (Ceuta and Melilla). The next day, November 1, Abbas el Fassi asked the King of Spain to \"waive\" the trip, while the Minister and Speaker of the Moroccan government, Khalid Naciri, expressed the \"total rejection and condemnation\" of the royal visit to \"despoiled Moroccan cities.\" Abbas el Fassi, however, at the time said the Spanish press that there was no coercion and that the conflict \"must be approached with intelligence, mutual respect, dialogue and concertation.\"\n\nOn November 5, while King Juan Carlos I was visiting Ceuta, Abbas el Fassi compared the situation of Ceuta and Melilla to the Israeli occupation of Palestine during a special session of the Moroccan Parliament to discuss the issue.\n\nThe same opinion was pronounced by the leader of the Moroccan Islamist Justice and Development Party, Mustafa Ramid, by manifesting in the Parliament that \"the Moroccans living under Spanish colonization are as our fellow Palestinians under Israeli colonization.\"\n\nOn November 6, after holding a Council of Ministers before intervening in the acts of commemoration of the Green March in the Parliament, Moroccan King Mohamed VI issued a harsh condemnation through a personnel spokesman:\nIn the same statement Mohamed VI called for the formal opening of negotiations on the two cities:\nOn 15 November, the government spokesman Khalid Naciri, after a Governing Council, stated that he hoped that the Spanish \"place their hand into ours to overcome the crisis and privileging our bilateral relationship. The Spanish-Moroccan relations have undergone a crisis.\" Do not set a date for the return of the ambassador to Madrid, insist on the need for a dialogue between the parties about the future of the Spanish autonomous cities and it is expected for the future that \"our Spanish friends will consider our feelings, our sensitivity and our claims; the purpose is not to create difficulties but to preserve our relations.\" However, on 16 November, the Government of Morocco suspended two high-level visits of Spanish authorities:that of the Minister of Public Works, Magdalena Álvarez, who had planned to deal with the Moroccan Minister of Equipment and Transport Karim Ghellab about the Gibraltar rail tunnel to link the two countries across the strait (an issue on which both are officially working since 2005 when Tangier was treated evolving the fixed links between Europe and Africa and Chief of Staff of the Army of Spain, Admiral Sebastian Zaragoza.\n\nOn the same day, November 1, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Spain, Miguel Angel Moratinos, who was visiting the Moroccan city of Marrakech, reported orally to the Moroccan Foreign Minister Taieb Fassi-Fihri, despite the manifestations of the Prime Minister, that the King of Spain would visit the cities of Ceuta and Melilla on 5 and 6 November as planned. That same day, in the usual appearance of the Government of Spain after the conclusion of the regular meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Second Deputy Prime Minister Maria Teresa Fernandez de la Vega said that relations with the Moroccan government \"were extraordinary\" and the journey of the Kings fell within the \"institutional normality.\" Foreign Affairs Minister, Moratinos ruled out an action similar withdrawing the ambassador of Spain in Rabat, Spanish diplomatic sources said.\n\nOn November 3, Defense Minister Jose Antonio Alonso, in a statement to the Cadena SER said that he hoped the gesture of calling the ambassador-step prior to the breakdown of diplomatic relations, he repeated the words said by Deputy Prime Minister the previous day on the normality of the visit.\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs expressed on November 14 its confidence in the return of the Moroccan ambassador in Madrid \"as soon as possible.\"\n\nThe People's Party and United Left political parties, through Angel Acebes and Gaspar Llamazares, respectively, announced their support for the visit of the King of Spain to Ceuta and Melilla. Gustavo de Arístegui, of the People Party, termed Mohamed VI's reaction as \"excessive\" and criticized the Spanish Prime Minister for failing to make clear, in his view, the 'red lines' that Morocco could not cross. Meanwhile, Elena Valenciano, International Relations Secretary of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, stressed that the visit was part of \"the most absolute institutional normality.\"\n\nThe President of Melilla, Juan José Imbroda, said that \"it is not the time to make opposite sounding declarations\", in reference to the Moroccan position. Coalition for Melilla, the prime Muslim-based opposition party in the autonomous city, manifested itself as extremely pleased with the visit the King, adding that the presence of the King of Spain was a \"historic debt in this city and which, from this formation, we always advocate for the occurrence of the visit.\" For his part, the President of Ceuta, Juan Jesus Vivas, merely issued an edict in which he urged the citizens to welcome the King, honor him by the presence of Ceutans, and \"you will honor yourselves, our city and our beloved country.\"\n"}

In Davis' earlier work, \"The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government\", he had written what is probably the most thorough exegesis of the compact theory of the United States Constitution in existence, devoting the first fifteen chapters of the book to that topic. Fearful that his readers might not understand, or might forget, he repeated the explanation every second or third chapter after that.

The gnomon is not fixed and must change position daily to accurately indicate time of day. Hence there are no hour lines on the dial and the time of day is read only on the ellipse. As with most sundials, analemmatic sundials mark solar time rather than clock time. An analemmatic sundial is completely defined by\n\nAnalemmatic sundials are sometimes designed with a human as the gnomon. In this case the size of the hour marker ellipse is constrained by human height and the latitude of the sundial location - since the human gnomon shadow must fall on the hour marker ellipse to accurately indicate the time of day.\nHuman gnomon analemmatic sundials are not practical at lower latitudes where a human shadow is quite short during the summer months. A 66 inch tall person casts a 4-inch shadow at 27 deg latitude on the summer solstice.\n\nThe use of the adjective \"analemmatic\" to describe this class of sundial can be misleading, because there is no use of the equation of time or the analemma in the design of an analemmatic sundial. Mayall refers to the analemmatic sundial as \"the so-called Analemmatic Dial\", implying a lack of connection to the analemma. The dial of Brou in front of the church of Brou in Bourg-en-Bresse, France is an example of the erroneous use of the analemma in the construction of an analemmatic sundial. Rohr states \"The gnomon is displaced on the short axis of the ellipse and not on the meridian, whose presence here in the shape of an 8 is a mistake.\"\n\nAn analemmatic sundial uses a vertical gnomon and its hour lines are the vertical projection of the hour lines of a circular equatorial sundial onto a flat plane. Therefore, the analemmatic sundial is an ellipse, where the short axis is aligned North-South and the long axis is aligned East-West. The noon hour line points true North, whereas the hour lines for 6am and 6pm point due West and East, respectively; the ratio of the short to long axes equals the sine sin(Φ) of the local geographical latitude, denoted Φ. All the hour lines converge to a single centre; the angle θ of a given hour line with the noon hour is given by the formula\n\nwhere \"t\" is the time (in hours) before or after noon. \n\nHowever, the vertical gnomon does not always stand at the centre of the hour lines; rather, to show the correct time, the gnomon must be moved daily northwards from the centre by the distance\n\nwhere \"W\" is half the width of the ellipse and δ is the Sun's declination at that time of year. The declination measures how far the sun is above the celestial equator; at the equinoxes, δ=0 whereas it equals roughly ±23.5° at the summer and winter solstices.\n\n\n"}

It is bound roughly by North 19th Street to the north, North 10th Street to the south, North East 2nd Avenue to the west, and Biscayne Boulevard to the east.\n\nThe Arts & Entertainment District is an urban, residential neighborhood with many high-rise residential towers, as well as some smaller scale historic buildings. It is home to the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, the old \"Miami Herald\" headquarters (now located in Doral, Florida), and the Omni International Mall. Until 2014 it was one of the neighborhoods that hosted the annual Miami International Boat Show at the Sea Isle Marina. The City of Miami Cemetery, one of Miami's oldest cemeteries, is also located in the district, as well as the historic Women's Club, and some of Miami's oldest churches and synagogues.\n\nThe Arts & Entertainment District is served by the Omni Loop branch of the Metromover and by the Metrorail via Metromover at Government Center.\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1950s, the Omni area was a high-end shopping area with many major department stores along Biscayne Boulevard, such as Sears, Roebuck and Company (whose tower still stands at the Arsht Center), Jordan Marsh (NE 15th Street and Biscayne Blvd) built in 1956, and a Burdines (NE 14th Street and Biscayne Blvd). By 1930, this area of Biscayne Boulevard was the home of Sears (later Burdines) Store, and the Shrine Building (which still stands at NE 14th Street and Biscayne Blvd), all of which were designed and built by the Biscayne Boulevard Company in the Art Deco architectural style. The area from NE 13th to NE 16th Street was envisioned as a high-end shopping district. By 1930, early tenants in the Shrine Building included the Piggly-Wiggly grocery store, Biscayne-Page Electric Company, and the John Turner Piano Store on the first floor. Other tenants in 1930 were the Home Drug Store and the Burroughs Adding Machine Company.\n\nIn 1977, the Omni International Mall opened replacing much of the street-side stores with a suburban-style shopping mall. The mall brought many upscale stores to the Omni such as Emilio Pucci, Givenchy and Hermes. By the 1990s, however, the mall began to falter, and in 1991, Jordan Marsh closed, and in 1998, so did JC Penney. In 2000, the mall closed, and the area was reconverted into offices in 2007. Today, it houses a few office tenants and the Miami International University of Art and Design. It is also the corporate home of the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce. The name of the neighborhood today, comes from the name of the Omni Mall.\n\nIn the 2000s, rapid construction of high-rise residential skyscrapers has revitalized the neighborhood from urban blight. The area around Margaret Pace Park has seen large population growth from 2000 to 2010. Omni today has a large residential population, and with continued retail and residential construction in the neighborhood, has grown into its own unique neighborhood in the city.\n\n\nMetromover train system runs three lines throughout Downtown (the Downtown Loop, the Omni Loop, and the Brickell Loop). The Metromover connects with Metrorail and is free. There are two Metromover stations in the district- School Board Station and Adrienne Arsht Center. Transfers can be made to the Metrorail, Miami's heavy rail system, at Government Center, as well as to the Brickell and Inner Metromover loops. Metrorail has stops throughout Miami with connections to Miami International Airport, all Miami-Dade County bus lines, Tri-Rail and Amtrak. The main bus station is also located in the district, next to the Arsht Center at the Adrienne Arsht Center station.\n\nThe Arts & Entertainment District is served by Metrobus throughout the area, the Miami Metrorail, and the Metromover:\n\nMetrorail:\n\nMetromover:\n\nAs an urban and pedestrian-friendly area with an extensive public transit network, the Arts & Entertainment District and the greater Downtown area, is one of the areas in Miami where a car-free lifestyle is commonplace. Many residents get around by foot, bicycle, Metromover or by taxi. The Metromover is a popular alternative to walking in the area, especially on rainy, hot or cold days, as the Metromover is free, and stations are located roughly every two blocks throughout the area.\n\nRecently, the City of Miami, along with the Downtown Development Authority, has begun bicycle initiaves promoting citywide bike parking and bike lanes, that have made bicycling much more popular for residents. Bike lanes and bike sharrows are currently planned for the majority of Downtown streets to be painted by the end of 2010. The Venetian Causeway is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects South Beach to Omni. The Rickenbacker Causeway is very popular on weekends for recreational bicyclists, and often, bicycles can outnumber cars on the causeway.\n\n\nAlthough one of Miami's oldest neighborhoods, few buildings remain in the district from its founding days.

The book dates from the mid-13th century; its name comes from its association with the Priory of St. John the Evangelist and Teulyddog at Carmarthen, and is referred to as black due to the colour of its binding. It is currently part of the collection of the National Library of Wales, where it is catalogued as NLW Peniarth MS 1.\n\nThis was one of the collection of manuscripts amassed at the mansion of Hengwrt, near Dolgellau, Gwynedd, by Welsh antiquary Robert Vaughan (c.1592–1667); the collection later passed to the newly established National Library of Wales as the Peniarth or Hengwrt-Peniarth Manuscripts. It is believed that the manuscript is first recorded when it came into the possession of Sir John Price of Brecon (1502?–1555), whose work was to search the monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII. It was given to him by the treasurer of St David's Cathedral, having come from Carmarthen Priory. \"Llyfr Du Caerfyrddin\" was described by William Forbes Skene (1809–92) as one of the Four Ancient Books of Wales.\n\nWritten before 1250, the manuscript is a small (170 x 125 mm; 7 x 5 inches), incomplete, vellum codex of 54 folios (108 pages) in eight gatherings; several folios are missing. Although the product of a single scribe, inconsistency in the ruling of each folio, in the number of lines per folio, and in handwriting size and style, suggest an amateur writing over a long period of time. The opening folios, written in a large textura on alternating ruled lines, are followed by folios in a much smaller, cramped script.\n\nThe book contains a small group of triads about the horses of Welsh heroes, but is chiefly a collection of 9th–12th century poetry falling into various categories: religious and secular subjects, and odes of praise and of mourning. Of greater interest are the poems which draw on traditions relating to the Welsh heroes associated with the Hen Ogledd (Old North, i.e. Cumbria and the surrounding area), and especially those connected with the legend of Arthur and Myrddin, also known as Merlin, thus predating the descriptions of Merlin by Geoffrey of Monmouth. One of the poems, \"The Elegy of Gereint son of Erbin\", refers to the \"Battle of Llongborth\", the location of which can no longer be pinpointed, and mentions Arthur's involvement in the battle.\n\nThe poems \"Yr Afallennau\" and \"Yr Oianau\" describe the mad Merlin in a forest talking to an apple tree and a pig, prophesying the success or failure of the Welsh army in battles with the Normans in South Wales.\n\nSome of the other poems contained are:\n\nThere has been a call from the editor of the \"Carmarthen Journal\" newspaper to house the Black Book in its native Carmarthen, so that it might be seen by locals and tourists coming into the town.\n\nIn 2002, it was announced that the Black Book had been scanned, and made available online.\n\nIn 2014 it was suggested an interactive display about the book could be created in Carmarthen's St Peter's Church.\n\nIn March 2015, University of Cambridge Professor Paul Russell and Ph.D. student Myriah Williams reported that a variety of imaging techniques such as ultraviolet lamps and photo-editing software had revealed content that had been invisible under normal viewing conditions. Among the previously unknown material, erased half a millennium ago, were extensive marginal annotations, including an inscription suggesting that the book was gifted by a previous owner to a family member; drawings of a fish and of two human faces; and a previously unattested Welsh poem.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11824851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11824851", "title": "Bohemian glass", "text": "Bohemian glass\n\nBohemian glass, chiefly referred to as Bohemia crystal, is glass produced in the regions of Bohemia and Silesia, now parts of the Czech Republic. It has a centuries long history of being internationally recognised for its high quality, craftsmanship, beauty and often innovative designs. Hand-cut, engraved, blown and painted decorative glassware ranging from champagne flutes to enormous chandeliers, ornaments, figurines and other glass items are among the best known Czech exports and immensely popular as tourist souvenirs. The Czech Republic is home to numerous glass studios and schools attended by local and foreign students.\n\nOldest archaeological excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the Lusatian Mountains of Northern Bohemia. Most notable Czech sites of glass-making throughout the ages are Skalice (), Jablonec nad Nisou, Železný Brod, Poděbrady, Karlovy Vary, Kamenický Šenov () and Nový Bor (). Several of these towns have their own glass museums with many items dating since around 1600. Jablonec nad Nisou in particular is famous for the local tradition of manufacturing glass costume jewellery. Its long history is documented by large collections in the Museum of Glass and Jewellery in Jablonec nad Nisou.\n\nThe meaning of crystal versus glass changes according to the country. The word \"crystal\" means, in most of the western world, the presence of lead. In the European Union, labeling of \"crystal\" products is regulated by Council Directive 69/493/EEC, which defines four categories, depending on the chemical composition and properties of the material. Only glass products containing at least 24% of lead oxide may be referred to as \"lead crystal\". Products with less lead oxide, or glass products with other metal oxides used in place of lead oxide, must be labeled \"crystallin\" or \"crystal glass\". In the United States it is the opposite - glass is defined as \"crystal\" if it contains only 1% lead. In the Czech Republic, the term \"crystal\" is used for any exquisite, high quality glass. Leaded crystal means crystal containing more than 24% lead oxide.\n\nThe presence of lead in crystal softens the glass and makes it more accessible for cutting and engraving. Lead increases the weight of the glass and causes the glass to diffract light. Glass can contain up to 40% lead, if maximum hardness is desired. On the other hand, crystal can contain less than 24% lead if it has a high proportion of barium oxide, which ensures high quality light diffraction.\n\nBohemia, a part of the Czech Republic (formerly part of Czechoslovakia, formerly part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, originally part of Czech Kingdom or Kingdom of Bohemia), became famous for its beautiful and colourful glass during the Renaissance. The history of Bohemian glass started with the abundant natural resources found in the countryside.\n\nBohemian glass-workers discovered potash combined with chalk created a clear colourless glass that was more stable than glass from Italy. In the 16th century the term Bohemian crystal was used for the first time to distinguish its qualities from glass made elsewhere. This glass contained no lead as is commonly suspected. This Czech glass could be cut with a wheel. In addition, resources such as wood for firing the kilns and for burning down to ashes were used to create potash. There were also copious amounts of limestone and silica. In the 17th century, Caspar Lehmann, gem cutter to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with copper and bronze wheels. During the era, the Czech lands became the dominant producer of decorative glassware and the local manufacture of glass earned international reputation in high Baroque style from 1685 to 1750.\n\nCzech glassware became as prestigious as jewellery and was sought-after by the wealthy and the aristocracy of the time. Czech crystal chandeliers could be found in the palaces of the French king Louis XV, Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria, and Elizabeth of Russia.\n\nBohemia turned out expert craftsmen who artfully worked with crystal. Bohemian crystal became famous for its excellent cut and engraving. They became skilled teachers of glass-making in neighbouring and distant countries. By the middle of the 19th century, a technical glass-making school system was created that encouraged traditional and innovative techniques as well as thorough technical preparation.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Bohemia looked to the export trade and mass-produced coloured glass that was exported all over the world. Pairs of vases were produced either in a single colour of opaque glass or in two-colour cased glass. These were decorated in thickly enamelled flower subjects that were painted with great speed. Others were decorated with coloured lithographic prints copying famous paintings. These glass objects were made in huge quantities in large factories and were available by mail order throughout Europe and America. Many of them were not fine art but provided inexpensive decorative objects to brighten up ordinary homes. Reverse glass painting was also a Czech specialty. The image is carefully painted by hand on the back of a pane of glass, using a variety of techniques and materials, after which the painting is mounted in a bevelled wooden frame.\n\nGlass artisanship remained at a high level even under the Communists because it was considered ideologically innocuous and it helped promote the good name of the country. Czech glass designers and manufacturers enjoyed international recognition and Czech glassware including art works such as sculptures was displayed and awarded in many international exhibitions, most notably in Expo 58 world fair in Brussels and in Expo 67 in Montréal.\n\nToday, Czech crystal chandeliers hang, for example, in Milan's La Scala, in Rome's Teatro dell'Opera, in Versailles, in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg or in the royal palace in Riyadh. Various sorts of glassware, art glass, ornaments, figurines, costume jewellery, beads and others also remain internationally valued.\n\nOne of the glass items for which the Czech nation is still well known is the production of \"druk\" beads. Druks are small (3mm-18mm) round glass beads with small threading holes produced in a wide variety of colors and finishes and used mainly as spacers among beaded jewellery makers.\n\n"}
{"id": "730207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=730207", "title": "Boston accent", "text": "Boston accent\n\nA Boston accent is a local accent of Eastern New England English native specifically to the city of Boston and its suburbs. Eastern New England English also traditionally includes New Hampshire, Maine, all of eastern Massachusetts, and arguably Rhode Island, though some uniquely local vocabulary appears only around Boston. Some of the characteristics of traditional Boston accents may be retreating, particularly among younger residents. However, linguist William Labov claims that, in the twenty-first century, there remains a relatively stable Boston accent.\n\nBoston and surrounding northeastern New England form the only major region in North America where the distinction between the vowel phonemes \"broad \"a\"\" (as in \"father\") and \"short \"o\"\" (as in \"bother\") is often maintained (with some New York accents also following this pattern). Examples include words like \"father\" and \"spa\" which contain (, ) and \"bother\" and \"dock\" which contain (, ) being different. This means that even though \"dark\" has no in many Boston accents, it remains distinct from \"dock\" because its vowel quality is different: vs. . In this way, Bostonians align with most Britons, but unlike most other Americans, who use the same vowel in both of these classes: .\n\nOn the other hand, the Boston accent merges the \"short \"o\"\" with the \"aw\" phoneme: the two classes exemplified by \"caught\" and \"cot\" thus both become an often long and rounded , so that \"caught\", \"cot\", \"law\", \"wand\", \"rock\", \"talk\", \"doll\", and \"wall\" all are pronounced with the same vowel. By contrast, New York accents and southern New England accents have for \"caught\" and for \"cot\" and the London accents have and , respectively. In Boston and some other parts of New England, a few words ending in , e.g., \"hot\" and \"got\", can be pronounced with an entirely different phoneme, however, sounding instead like \"hut\" and \"gut\", respectively.\n\nEastern New England English has a so-called \"nasal short-\"a\" system\". This means that the \"short \"a\"\" vowel as in \"cat\" and \"rat\" becomes raised to a mid-high front diphthong when it precedes a nasal consonant (but also, on a continuous scale in some other environments); thus, \"man\" is and \"planet\" is . Boston shares this system with some of the Midwest and most of the West, though the raising in Boston tends to be more noticeable and extreme than elsewhere. This system is not shared with London or New York City accents. In addition to raising before nasals, Bostonians (unlike nearby New Hampshirites, for example) also tend to somewhat \"raise\" or \"break\" the \"short \"a\"\" sound the most before voiceless fricatives (followed by voiced stops, laterals, voiceless stops, and voiced fricatives), so that words like \"half\", \"bath\", and \"glass\" become , and , respectively. This trend began around the early-mid to mid-twentieth century, replacing the older Boston accent's London-like \"broad \"a\"\" system to an opener sound in those same example words (see \"Declining characteristics\" below).\n\nBoston accents make a greater variety of distinctions between short and long vowels before medial than many other modern American accents do: \"hurry\" and \"furry\" ; and \"mirror\" and \"nearer\" , though some of these distinctions are somewhat endangered as people under 40 in neighboring New Hampshire and Maine have lost them. Boston shares these distinctions with both New York and Received Pronunciation, but the Midwest, for instance, has lost them entirely.\n\nThe nuclei of the diphthongs and may be raised to something like before voiceless consonants: thus \"write\" has a higher vowel than \"ride\" and \"lout\" has a higher vowel than \"loud\". This effect is known usually as (one of the two phenomena of) Canadian raising, though it is less extreme in New England than in most of Canada. Furthermore, some Boston accents have a tendency to raise the diphthong in both voiced and voiceless environments and some Boston accents may raise the diphthong in certain voiced environments.\n\nThe nuclei of and are significantly less fronted than in many American accents. Both have may be diphthongized to approximately or .\n\nThe more deeply urban varieties of the Boston accent may use the dental stops to replace the normal English dental fricatives .\n\nThe traditional Boston accent is non-rhotic, particularly in the early 1900s. Recent studies have shown that younger speakers use more of a rhotic accent than older speakers from the Boston region. The phoneme does not appear in coda position (where in English phonotactics it must precede other consonants, see English phonology#Coda), as in most dialects of English in England and Australia; \"card\" therefore becomes \"cahd\". After high and mid-high vowels, the is replaced by or another neutral central vowel like : \"weird\" , \"square\" . Similarly, unstressed is replaced by , , or , as in \"color\" . A famous example is \"Park the car in Harvard Yard\", pronounced , or as if spelled \"pahk the cah(r) in Hahvud Yahd\". Note that the \"r\" in \"car\" would usually be pronounced in this case, because the following word begins with a vowel. The Boston accent possesses both linking R and intrusive R: That is to say, an will not be lost at the end of a word if the next word begins with a vowel, and indeed an will be inserted after a word ending with a central or low vowel if the next word begins with a vowel: \"the tuner is\" and \"the tuna is\" are both .\n\nMany characteristics of the Boston accent may be retreating, particularly among some younger residents. In the most \"old-fashioned\" of Boston accents, there may be a lingering resistance to the horse–hoarse merger, so that what in other dialects becomes a low back vowel : \"horse\" is , pronounced the same or almost the same as \"hoss\", while the word \"hoarse\" is somewhat different . Other words fall into these distinct classes too, like \"for\" vs. \"four\": vs. . This distinction is rapidly fading out of currency, as it is in almost all regions of North America that still make it. Regardless, for some Boston speakers, the words \"tot\", \"tort\", and \"taught\" may all be homophones.\n\nA feature that Boston speakers once shared with greater London, though now uncommon, is the \"broad \"a\"\" of the lexical set of words, making a distinction from the set. In particular words that in other American accents have the \"short \"a\"\" pronounced as , that vowel was replaced in the nineteenth century (if not earlier and often sporadically by speakers as far back as the late eighteenth century) with : thus, \"half\" as and \"bath\" as . Fewer words have the broad \"a\" in Boston English than in the London accents, and fewer and fewer Boston speakers maintain the broad \"a\" system as time goes on, with its transition into a decline occurring in speakers born from about 1930 to 1950 (and first documented as a decline in 1977). Boston speakers born before about 1930 used this broad \"a\" in the words \"after\", \"ask\", \"aunt\", \"bath\", \"calf\", \"can't\", \"glass\", \"half\", \"laugh\", \"pasture\", \"path\", and perhaps other words, and born from about 1930 to 1950 use it only in \"aunt\", \"calf\", \"half\", \"laugh\", and \"pass\". Speakers born since 1950 typically have no broad \"a\" whatsoever and, instead, slight /æ/ raising (i.e. ), for example, in \"craft\", \"bad\", \"math\", etc.) with this same set of words and, variably, other instances of short \"a\" too. Only \"aunt\" maintains the broad \"a\" sound in even the youngest speakers, though this one word is a common exception throughout all of the Northeastern U.S.\n\nAlthough not all Boston-area speakers are non-rhotic, non-rhoticity remains the feature most widely associated with the region. As a result, it is frequently the subject of humor about Boston, as in comedian Jon Stewart joking in his book \"America\" that, although John Adams drafted the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution, \"delegates from his state refused to ratify the letter 'R'.\"\n\nBeing conspicuous and easily identifiable as regional, Boston accents are routinely featured by actors in films set in Boston, particularly for working-class white characters, such as in \"Good Will Hunting\", \"Mystic River\", \"The Departed\", \"Manchester by the Sea\", \"The Town\", \"Ted\", \"The Fighter\", and \"Black Mass\". Television series based within a Boston setting such as \"Boston Public\" and \"Cheers\" have featured the accent. \"Simpsons\" character Mayor Quimby talks with an exaggerated Boston accent as reference to the former US Senator Ted Kennedy. Television comedy sketches have featured the accent, including \"The Boston Teens\" and \"Dunkin Donuts\" on \"Saturday Night Live\", as well as \"Boston Accent Trailer\" on \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\". The popular American TV series M*A*S*H had, from its sixth season onwards, the Boston-born upper-class surgeon character Major Charles Emerson Winchester III, portrayed by David Ogden Stiers, always spoken with his characterization'a noticeable Boston accent. \n\nIn \"The Heat\", the family of Shannon Mullins all speak with the Boston accent and confusion arrises from the pronunciation of the word \"narc\" as \"nahk\". \"30 Rock\" character Nancy Donovan speaks with a pronounced Boston accent. In the video game \"Team Fortress 2\", the character Scout, who is himself a Boston native, talks with a distinct Boston accent, although it sometimes lapses into a Brooklyn accent. Many elements of the Boston accent can be heard on the animated TV series \"Family Guy\", which is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island.\n\nSome words most famously associated with the Boston area are:\nMany words common to Boston are also common throughout the New England dialects: \"blinkers\" for \"automobile turn signals\" (the Massachusetts Department of Transportation even has signs reminding motorists, with Boston phonetic spelling, to \"Use Yah Blinkah\"), \"packie\" (or \"package store\") for \"liquor store\", and \"rotary\" for \"traffic circle\" (these full-speed circular intersections being common in Greater Boston).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

There is a Roman marble version of this subject from the Medici collections in a corridor of the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.\n\nThe sculpture was one of the very few Roman bronzes that was never lost to sight. The work was standing outside the Lateran Palace when the Navarrese rabbi Benjamin of Tudela saw it in the 1160s and identified it as Absalom, who \"was without blemish from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.\" It was noted around 1200 by the English visitor, Magister Gregorius, who noted in his \"De mirabilibus urbis Romae\" that it was ridiculously thought to be Priapus. It must have been one of the sculptures transferred to the Palazzo dei Conservatori by Pope Sixtus IV in the 1470s, though it is not recorded there until 1499-1500. \n\nIn the Early Renaissance, it was celebrated through being one of the first Roman sculptures to be copied. There are bronze reductions by Severo da Ravenna and Jacopo Buonaccolsi (called \"L'Antico\" for his refined, classicizing figures). Buonaccolsi made a copy for Isabella d'Este around 1501 that is now in the Galleria Estense, Modena. He followed that work with an untraced pendant that perhaps reversed the pose. In 1500, Antonello Gagini made a full-size variant for a fountain in Messina, which is probably the bronze version that now resides in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, bronze copies made suitably magnificent ambassadorial gifts to the King of France and the King of Spain. Francis I of France was given a version by Ippolito II d'Este. The making of this copy was overseen by Giovanni Fancelli and Jacopo Sansovino, and the transaction effected by the courtly Benvenuto Cellini. It now is held in the Musée du Louvre. Philip II of Spain received a copy from Cardinal Giovanni Ricci. In the following century, Charles I of England had a bronze \"Spinario\" made by Hubert Le Sueur.\n\nSmall bronze reductions were suitable for the less grand. A \"Still Life with 'Spinario\"' by Pieter Claesz, 1628, is conserved at the Rijksmuseum, and among the riches emblematic of the good life, it displays a small plaster model of the \"Spinario\".\n\nThere were also marble copies. The Medici Roman marble seems to have been among the collection of antiquities assembled in the gardens at San Marco, Florence, which were the resort of the humanists in the circle of Lorenzo il Magnifico, who opened his collection to young artists to study from. The young Michelangelo profited from this early exposure to antique sculpture. and it has been discussed whether Masaccio was influenced by the Medici \"Spinario\" or by the bronze he saw in Rome in the 1420s. \nHowever, Filippo Brunelleschi more certainly adapted the \"Spinario\"'s pose for the left-hand attendant in 1401 for his bronze panel \"The Sacrifice of Isaac\", which was his trial piece for the competition to design the doors of the Baptistery of San Giovanni.\nThe formerly popular title \"Il Fedele\" (\"The faithful boy\") derived from an anecdote invented to give this intimate and naturalistic study a more heroic civic setting: the faithful messenger, a mere shepherd boy, had delivered his message to the Roman Senate first, only then stopping to remove a painful thorn from his foot: the Roman Senate commemorated the event. Such a story was already deflated in Paolo Alessandro Maffei's \"Raccolta di statue antiche e moderni...\" of 1704\n\nTaking into account Hellenistic marble variants that have been discovered, of which the best is the \"Thorn-Puller\" from the Castellani collection now in the British Museum, none of which have the archaizing qualities of the bronze \"Spinario\", recent scholarship has tended to credit this as a Roman bronze of the first century CE, with a head adapted from an archaic prototype.\n\n"}

It is one of the Burial Acts 1852 to 1885. Its purpose is to regulate burial grounds. It regulates where and how deceased people may be buried, and provides for the exhumation of remains. The Act made it illegal to disturb a grave (other than for an officially sanctioned exhumation). The Act did not make it illegal to steal a dead body, and it is only the opening of the grave which constitutes an offence, not the removal of the contents.\n\nThe Government Department for Constitutional Affairs provides guidance for burial ground managers, and many aspect of it relate to provisions contained in the Burial Act 1857. \n\nConcerns arose that due to pressures of population movement to urban areas during the Industrial revolution that burial graves were reused too quickly. The offence of disturbing a burial included in the Burial Act 1857 was based on the Victorian value that a burial was for eternity. Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857 makes it unlawful in England and Wales to disturb human burials except without a licence from the Secretary of State, or on ground consecrated by the rites of the Church of England, without the permission of the church. The mechanisms about how the Church of England provides this permission slightly differs depending if the remains are at a church or cathedral.. In Scotland, the law is different and covered by the Burial and Cremations Act (Scotland) Act 2016. The powers for a coroner to permit an exhumation fall outside the scope of the Burial Act 1857 and The Coroners And Justice Act 2009 allows them to authorise an exhumation for the purposes of a post-mortem and in relation criminal proceedings.\n\nThe Blagdon Cemetery [2002] Court of Arches case is the basis of the Church of England exhumation guidelines. The viewpoint of the Church of England is burial is final and only grants exhumation in exceptional circumstances. The Advisory Panel on the Archaeology of Burials in England is a partnership between Historic England, and the Church of England providing guidance based on the law, archaeological research, and theology. In England and Wales, The Ministry of Justice holds the right to issue exhumation licence. Before issuing a licence, consent is required from close relatives of the deceased, grave owner, and burial authority.\n\nIn 2004, the Government, in response to the problem of the lack of space for new burials, partly a consequence of the Burial Act 1857, held a consultation called, “Burial Law and Policy in the 21 Century”. The consultation considered how to address the problem that when a burial ground became full, it generated no income from new burials, and without income, it may become difficult to maintain and fall into neglect. \n\nLondon Burial Authorities in some instances could reclaim and reuse a grave after 75 years, under the London Authorities Act 2007. Extending this provision elsewhere in the country was deliberated. The consultation considered the ‘Exclusive Rights for Burial’. When purchasing a grave, a person usually buys the right to exclusive be buried in it for a period, often 100 years, they do not buy the land. Noted was the possibility of reusing graves with the permission of the Church of England. Section 25 of the Burial Act 1857, amended by Section 2 of the Church of England (Miscellaneous Provisions) Measures 2014 permitted the disturbance of graves with Church of England permission. Successive Government have considered the problem of lack of space for graves but not taken at this time taken any action. \n\nThe 2015 amendments to the Burial Act 1857, allowing the Church of England to reuse graves, was controversial. Such changes have been criticised as offensive and distressing to the living, and disrespectful to the dead.\n\n"}

{"id": "185095", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185095", "title": "Chinook Jargon", "text": "Chinook Jargon\n\nChinook Jargon (also known as ', or ') is a nearly extinct American indigenous language originating as a pidgin trade language in the Pacific Northwest, and spreading during the 19th century from the lower Columbia River, first to other areas in modern Oregon and Washington, then British Columbia and as far as Alaska and Yukon Territory, sometimes taking on characteristics of a creole language. It is partly descended from the Chinook language, upon which much of its vocabulary is based.\n\nMany words from Chinook Jargon remain in common use in the Western United States, British Columbia and the Yukon, in indigenous languages as well as regional English usage. The total number of Jargon words in published lexicons numbered only in the hundreds, and so it was easy to learn. It has its own grammatical system, but a very simple one that, like its word list, was easy to learn. Though existent in Chinook Jargon, the consonant is rare, and English and French loan words, such as \"rice\" and , have changed in their adoption to the Jargon, to and , respectively.\n\nThe Jargon was originally constructed from a great variety of Amerindian words of the Pacific Northwest, arising as an intra-indigenous contact language in a region marked by divisive geography and intense linguistic diversity. The participating peoples came from a number of very distinct language families, speaking dozens of individual languages. It peaked in usage from approximately 1858 to 1900, and declined as a result of the Spanish Flu, World War I and residential schools.\n\nAfter European contact, the Jargon also acquired English and French loans, as well as words brought by other European, Asian, and Polynesian groups. Some individuals from all these groups soon adopted The Jargon as a highly efficient and accessible form of communication. This use continued in some business sectors well into the 20th century and some of its words continue to feature in company and organization names as well as in the regional toponymy.\n\nIn the Diocese of Kamloops, British Columbia, hundreds of speakers also learned to read and write the Jargon using Duployan shorthand via the publication \"Kamloops Wawa\". As a result, the Jargon also had the beginnings of its own literature, mostly translated scripture and classical works, and some local and episcopal news, community gossip and events, and diaries. Novelist and early Native American activist Marah Ellis Ryan (c. 1860-1934) used Chinook words and phrases in her writing.\n\nIn Oregon, Chinook Jargon was widely used by Natives, trappers, traders, employees of the Hudson's Bay Company, missionaries, and pioneers who came across the Oregon Trail from the 1830s-1870s. In Portland's first half century (1840s-1890s) there were frequent trade interactions between pioneers and Native Americans. After about 1900, when such daily interactions were less frequent, Jargon was spoken among pioneer families to prove how early they arrived out west. Many Oregonians used Jargon in casual conversation—to add humor, whimsy or emphasis and to exhibit deep knowledge of Oregon's history. Though traditions of speaking Jargon faded away among the non-Native population, some of Oregon's tribal groups continued speaking Chinook Jargon, though usage was diminished. However, a strong revival occurred with the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon's 2012 \"Chinuk Wawa\" dictionary.\n\nAccording to Nard Jones, Chinook Jargon was still in use in Seattle until roughly the eve of World War II, especially among the members of the Arctic Club, making Seattle the last city where the language was widely used. Writing in 1972, he remarked that at that later date \"Only a few can speak it fully, men of ninety or a hundred years old, like Henry Broderick, the realtor, and Joshua Green, the banker.\"\n\nJones estimates that in pioneer times in the 1860s there were about 100,000 speakers of Chinook Jargon.\n\nMost books written in English still use the term Chinook Jargon, but some linguists working with the preservation of a creolized form of the language used in Grand Ronde, Oregon prefer the term \"Chinuk Wawa\" (with the spelling 'Chinuk' instead of 'Chinook'). Historical speakers did not use the name \"Chinook Wawa\", however, but rather \"the Wawa\" or \"Lelang\" (from Fr. \"la langue\", the language, or tongue). NB \"Wawa\" also means speech or words – \"have a wawa\" means \"hold a parley\" even in idiomatic English today, and \"lelang\" also means the physical bodypart, the tongue.\n\nThe name for the Jargon varied throughout the territory in which it was used. For example: \"skokum hiyu\" in the Boston Bar-Lytton area of the Fraser Canyon, or in many areas simply just \"the old trade language\" or \"the Hudson Bay language\".\n\nThere is some controversy about the origin of the Jargon, but all agree that its glory days were during the 19th century. During this era many dictionaries were published to help settlers interact with the First Nations people living there. The old settler families' heirs in the Pacific Northwest sent communiques to each other, stylishly composed entirely in \"the Chinook\". Many residents of the British Columbia city of Vancouver spoke Chinook Jargon as their first language, even using it at home in preference to English. Among the first Europeans to use Chinook Jargon were traders, trappers, Voyageurs, Coureurs des bois and Catholic missionaries. \n\nHawaiians and American in the region made much use of it as well. In some places Kanakas married into the First Nations and non-native families and their particular mode of the Jargon is believed to have contained Hawaiian words, or Hawaiian styles of pronunciation. Similarly the Jargon as spoken by a Chinese person or a Norwegian or a Scot will have been influenced by those individuals' native-speaker terms and accents. In some areas the adoption of further non-aboriginal words has been observed. The Chinook Jargon naturally became the first language in multi-racial households and in multi-ethnic work environments such as canneries and lumberyards and ranches where it remained the language of the workplace well into the middle of the 20th century. During the Gold Rush, Chinook Jargon was used in British Columbia by gold prospectors and Royal Engineers. As industry developed, Chinook Jargon was often used by cannery workers and hop pickers of diverse ethnic background. Loggers, fishermen and ranchers incorporated it in their jargon.\n\nA heavily creolized form of Chinook Jargon (Chinuk Wawa) is still spoken as a first language by some residents of Oregon, much as the Métis language Michif is spoken in Canada. Hence, Chinuk Wawa as it is known in Oregon is now a creole language, distinct from the widespread and widely varied pronunciation of the Chinook Jargon as it spread beyond the Chinookan homeland. There is evidence that in some communities (e.g., around Fort Vancouver) the Jargon had become creolized by the early 19th century and that would have been among the mixed French/Métis, Algonkian, Scots and Hawaiian population there as well as among the natives around the Fort. At Grand Ronde, the resettlement of tribes from all over Oregon in a multi-tribal agency led to the use of Chinuk Wawa as a common tongue among the linguistically diverse population. These circumstances led to the creolization of Chinuk Wawa at Grand Ronde. There is also evidence that creolization occurred at the Confederated Tribes of Siletz reservation paralleling Grand Ronde although, due to language revitalization efforts being focused on the Tolowa language, Chinuk fell out of use.\n\nNo studies of British Columbia versions of the Jargon have demonstrated creolization. The range of varying usages and vocabulary in different regions suggests that localization did occur — although not on the pattern of Grand Ronde where Wasco, Klickitat and other peoples adopted and added to the version of the Jargon that developed there. First-language speakers of the Chinook Jargon were common in BC (native and non-native), until the mid-20th century. It is a truism that while after 1850 the Wawa was mostly a native language in the United States portion of the Chinook-speaking world, it remained in wide use among non-natives north of the border for another century, especially in wilderness areas and work environments. Local creolizations probably did occur in British Columbia, but recorded materials have not been studied as they were made due to the focus on the traditional aboriginal languages.\n\nMany believe that something similar to the Jargon existed before European contact — without European words in its vocabulary. There is some evidence for a Chinookan-Nuu-chah-nulth lingua franca in the writings of John Jewitt and in what is known as the Barclay Sound word-list, from the area of Ucluelet and Alberni. Others believe that the Jargon was formed in the great cultural cauldron of the time of Contact and cannot be discussed separately from that context, with an appreciation for the full range of the Jargon-speaking community and its history.\n\nCurrent scholarly opinion holds that a trade language probably existed before European contact, which began \"morphing\" into the more familiar Chinook Jargon in the late 1790s, notably at a dinner party at Nootka Sound where Capts Vancouver and Bodega y Quadra were entertained by Chief Maquinna and his brother Callicum performing a theatrical using mock English and mock Spanish words and mimicry of European dress and mannerisms. There evidently was a Jargon in use in the Queen Charlotte, but this \"Haida Jargon\" is not known to have shared anything in common with Chinook Jargon, or with the Nooktan-Chinookan \"proto-jargon\" which is its main foundation.\n\nPacific Northwest historians are well acquainted with the Chinook Jargon, in name if not in the ability to understand it. Mentions of and phrases of Chinook Jargon were found in nearly every piece of historical source material before 1900. Chinook Jargon is relatively unknown to the rest of the population, perhaps due to the great influx of newcomers into the influential urban areas. However, the memory of this language is not likely to fade entirely. Many words are still used and enjoyed throughout Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, the Yukon, and Alaska. Old-timers still dimly remember it, although in their youth, speaking this language was discouraged as slang. Nonetheless, it was the working language in many towns and workplaces, notably in ranching country and in canneries on the British Columbia Coast where it was necessary in the strongly multi-ethnic workforce. Place names throughout this region bear Jargon names (see List of Chinook Jargon placenames) and words are preserved in various rural industries such as logging and fishing.\n\nThe Chinook Jargon was multicultural and functional. To those familiar with it, Chinook Jargon is often considered a wonderful cultural inheritance. For this reason, and because Jargon has not quite died, enthusiasts actively promote the revival of the language in everyday western speech.\n\nThe Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon is taking steps to preserve Chinook Jargon use through a full immersion head start/preschool which is conducted in Chinuk Wawa, in hopes of fostering fluency in the language. The Confederated Tribes also offer Chinuk Wawa lessons at their offices in Eugene and Portland, Oregon. In addition, Lane Community College offers two years of Chinuk Wawa language study that satisfy second-language graduation requirements of Oregon public universities.\n\nIn March 2012, the Tribe published a Chinuk Wawa dictionary through University of Washington Press.\n\nAt her swearing-in as lieutenant governor in 2001, Iona Campagnolo concluded her speech in Chinook, observing that \"konoway tillicums klatawa kunamokst klaska mamook okoke huloima chee illahie\" - Chinook for \"everyone was thrown together to make this strange new country (British Columbia).\"\n\nAn art installation featuring Chinook Jargon, \"Welcome to the Land of Light\" by Henry Tsang, can be viewed on the Seawall along False Creek in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia between Davie and Drake streets. Translation into Chinook Jargon was done by Duane Pasco.\n\nA short film using Chinook Jargon, \"Small Pleasures\" by Karin Lee explores intercultural dialogue between three women of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds in 1890's Barkerville in Northern British Columbia.\n\nChinuk Wawa was classified as extinct until the 2000s when it was revived, notably in 2014 with the release of \"Chinuk Wawa—As our elders teach us to speak it\" by the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde Community of Oregon. In 2018 a textbook for Chinook Jargon in Esperanto (\"La Chinuka Interlingvo Per Esperanto\", \"The Chinook Bridge-Language Using Esperanto\") was published in both physical and e-book formats by Sequoia Edwards.\n\nDuring termination of aboriginal peoples by the United States government, speaking of the language was forbidden, and as a result, developed a decline of speakers. After the conclusion of the termination era with the restoration of tribes in the pacific northwest area, revival of Chinuk Wawa began. To date, there are fluent speakers of Chinuk Wawa, primarily in the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde.\n\nBritish Columbian English and Pacific Northwest English have several words still in current use which are loanwords from the Chinook Jargon, which was widely spoken throughout the Pacific Northwest by all ethnicities well into the middle of the 20th century. These words tend to be shared with, but are not as common in, the states of Oregon, Washington, Alaska and, to a lesser degree, Idaho and western Montana.\n\n\n\n\nNote: The Incubator link at right will take you to the Chinuk Wawa test-Wikipedia, which is written in a variation of the standardized orthography of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde which differs significantly from the orthographies used by early linguists and diarists recording other versions of the Jargon:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It's used as a euphemism for drowning or shipwrecks in which the sailors' and ships' remains are consigned to the bottom of the sea (to be \"sent to Davy Jones' Locker\").\n\nThe origins of the name of Davy Jones, the sailors' devil, are unclear, with a 19th-century dictionary tracing Davy Jones to a \"ghost of Jonah\". Other explanations of this nautical superstition have been put forth, including an incompetent sailor or a pub owner who kidnapped sailors.\n\nThe earliest known reference of the negative connotation of Davy Jones occurs in the \"Four Years Voyages of Capt. George Roberts\", by the author Daniel Defoe, published in 1726 in London.\n\nAn early description of Davy Jones occurs in Tobias Smollett's \"The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle\", published in 1751:\n\nIn the story, Jones is described as having saucer eyes, three rows of teeth, horns, a tail, and blue smoke coming from his nostrils.\n\nThe origin of the tale of Davy Jones is unclear, and many conjectural or folkloric explanations have been told:\n\nNot all traditions dealing with Davy Jones are fearful. In traditions associated with sailors crossing the Equatorial line, there was a \"raucous and rowdy\" initiation presided over by those who had crossed the line before, known as shellbacks, or Sons of Neptune. The eldest shellback was called King Neptune, and Davy Jones would be re-enacted as his first assistant.\n\nIn 1824, Washington Irving mentions Jones's name in his \"Adventures of the Black Fisherman\":\nIn Edgar Allan Poe's \"\" of 1835, Davy Jones is referred to dismissively by the anti-hero, Tarpaulin, when King Pest refers to \"that unearthly sovereign\" \"whose name is Death.\" Tarpaulin responds, \"Whose name is Davy Jones!\"\n\nHerman Melville mentions Jones in the 1851 classic \"Moby-Dick\":\nIn Charles Dickens's \"Bleak House\" (1852–53), the character Mrs. Badger quotes her former husband's work ethic, portraying Davy Jones in a formidable light:\nIn Robert Louis Stevenson's 1883 novel \"Treasure Island\", Davy Jones appears three times, for example in the phrase \"in the name of Davy Jones\".\n\nIn J. M. Barrie's 1904 play and 1911 novel \"Peter and Wendy\", Captain Hook sings a song:\nA US Navy song, \"Anchors Aweigh\", refers to Davy Jones in its current lyrics adopted in the 1920s:\nThe comic strip Terry and the Pirates (Sunday strip March 3, 1935, 10th picture) contains the line \"Boy! - I'm flirtin' with ol' Davey Jones! - this weepin' bomb had better work!\". It is said by Terry as he is climbing the outside of a ship at sea while fighting pirates.\n\nThe 1959 Broadway musical \"Davy Jones' Locker\" with Bil Baird's marionettes had a two-week run at the Morosco Theatre.\n\nLate 20th-century songs that refer to Davy Jones include Paul McCartney's song \"Morse Moose and the Grey Goose\" and the Beastie Boys' song \"Rhymin and Stealin\".\n\nIn the English translations of \"The Adventures of Tintin\", the character Captain Haddock makes occasional references to Davy Jones. Also, \"Secret of the Unicorn\", on page 17, while recounting Sir Francis Haddock's manuscript to Tintin, references a pirate ship raising the red flag and says, \"The red pennant!... No quarter given!... A fight to the death, no prisoners taken! You understand? If we're beaten, then it's every man to Davy Jones's locker!\" However, it is not the case in the original version, since the idiom only exists in English (in French, he uses another archaic French idiom, \"Que le Grand Cric me croque !\", which is not particularly related to sailors and has nothing to do with Davy Jones).\n\nIn the Genesis song \"Dodo/Lurker\" from the 1981 album \"Abacab\", the sixth stanza has the lyrics: \n\"One he got a dream of love, deep as the ocean \nWhere does he go, what does he do? \nWill the siren team with Davy Jones, \nAnd trap him at the bottom of the sea?\"\n\nThe Iron Maiden song \"Run Silent Run Deep\" (about submarine warfare) contains the lines: \"The lifeboats shattered, the hull is torn/The tar black smell of burning oil/On the way down to Davy Jones/Every man for himself – you're on your own...\"\n\nThe band Clutch have a song entitled \"Big News I\", which says, when played backwards, \"them bones, them bones, them dry, dry bones/ Come down to the locker of Davy Jones\".\n\nIn the 1960s television series \"The Monkees\" episode \"Hitting The High Seas\", the character Davy Jones (played by musician Davy Jones) receives special treatment while kidnapped in a ship as he claims to be related to \"The Original\" Davy Jones, his grandfather. Meanwhile, his fellow band members are held hostage, leading to various humorous situations. The fact that Jones the musician shared a name with the legendary seafarer has itself led to a number of puns swapping the two in the decades that followed.\n\nIn the UK TV sitcom \"Only Fools and Horses\" (\"The Frog's Legacy\"), Del Boy mentions \"it's not going to end up in Davy Jones' locker\" at the end.\n\nIn the 1994 movie \"The Pagemaster\", Adventure (Patrick Stewart) and Richard Tyler (Macaulay Culkin) are shipwrecked, and when Richard Tyler asks what happened to Fantasy and Horror, Adventure sadly replies, \"I'm afraid they've gone below to Davey Jones.\"\n\nThe Tears for Fears song \"Don't Drink the Water\" from the 1995 album \"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\" contains the lines: \"I saw you swim / Sink to your grave / Down to Davy Jones' locker / Under the waves...\"\n\nIn the cartoon \"The Haunted Ship\", from the Aesop's Fables series produced by the Van Beuren animation studios, Davy Jones is depicted as a living skeleton wearing a pirate's bicorn.\n\nThe concept of Davy Jones was conflated with the legend of the \"Flying Dutchman\" in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film series, in which Davy Jones's locker is portrayed as a purgatory place of punishment for those who crossed Davy Jones. Jones is portrayed as a captain assigned to ferry those drowned at sea to the afterlife before he corrupted his purpose out of anger at his betrayal by his lover, the sea goddess Calypso. Davy Jones is portrayed in the movie as an enigma of the sea, featuring octopus arms for a beard and crab claw for a hand.\n\nThe origins of Davy Jones and Calypso are revealed in the stand-alone novella \"Davy Jones & the Heart of Darkness\". The Scottish origins are consistent with the legend, but this novella includes Davy's training aboard Inferno with Charon, the ferryman of Hades. The tale is written by Dave Montalbano and illustrated by Rachel Galvin.\n\nIn the video game \"Banjo-Tooie\", in world 4 (Jolly Roger's Lagoon), the player can swim to the bottom of the lagoon and find a giant locker with the name \"D. Jones\" on it (among many other lockers bearing the names of various Rare developers). Inside the locker is a cavern containing the level boss, an anglerfish named Lord Woo Fak Fak.\n\nThe term has also been used repeatedly in the animated TV series \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" to represent an actual locker in the bottom of the sea where Davy Jones (of The Monkees fame) keeps his gym socks.\n\nPlayers of the 21st-century real-world treasure-hunting game of Geocaching have been inspired to hide a number of geocaches containing a reference to Davy Jones's Locker.\n\nAdam Carolla has repeatedly used or referenced the term on his daily podcast, \"The Adam Carolla Show\".\n\nThe Devil Makes Three references the idiom on their single \"The Plank\".\n\nSleeping With Sirens references Davy Jones on their song \"Don't Fall Asleep At The Helm\".\n\nIn his novel \"The Last Dickens\", Matthew Pearl makes the Captain of the \"Samaria\" transatlantic liner assume that Herman the Parsee might be \"sleeping soundly in Davy Jones's locker\", namely that he \"\"has almost certainly perished in the depths\".\" Use of seamen jargon chimes with the Dickensian topic and environment of the novel.\n\nIn the novel \"The Amber Spyglass\" (the third and last book of Philip Pullman's trilogy \"His Dark Materials\"), Lyra Belacqua tells the tale (actually, a lie) that her friend Roger Parslow \"lost his footing and plunged down into Davy Jones's Locker\".\n\nFrench singer Nolwenn Leroy recorded a song titled \"Davy Jones\" for her 2012 album \"Ô Filles de l'Eau\". The English version contains the lines: \"Davy Jones, oh Davy Jones / Where they gonna rest your bones / Down in the deep blue sea / Down in the deep blue sea...\"\n\nAmerican surf-rock/punk band Rusty Shipp released a song in late 2012 titled \"Davy Jones Ain't Got Nothin' On Me\", which makes several references to Davy Jones's Locker, and also is believed to make reference to the \"Flying Dutchman\" myth. This is especially prevalent in the lines: \"all of the sudden, a ghost ship appears/with a crew of souls whose singing I hear\".\n\n\"Monster High\" character Dayna Treasura Jones is the pirate daughter of Davy Jones.\n\nIn the sixteenth episode of the seventh season of \"Once Upon a Time\", Davy Jones' Locker appears as a treasure chest at the bottom of the sea.\n\n"}

{"id": "187586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187586", "title": "Family Guy", "text": "Family Guy\n\nFamily Guy is an American animated sitcom created by Seth MacFarlane for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series centers on the Griffins, a family consisting of parents Peter and Lois; their children, Meg, Chris, and Stewie; and their anthropomorphic pet dog, Brian. The show is set in the fictional city of Quahog, Rhode Island, and exhibits much of its humor in the form of metafictional cutaway gags that often lampoon American culture.\n\nThe family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, \"The Life of Larry\" and \"Larry & Steve\". MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox in 1998, and the show was greenlit and began production. Shortly after the third season of \"Family Guy\" had aired in 2002, Fox canceled the series with one episode left unaired. Adult Swim aired that episode in 2003, finishing the series' original run. However, favorable DVD sales and high ratings for syndicated reruns on Adult Swim convinced the network to renew the show in 2004 for a fourth season, which began airing on May 1, 2005.\n\nSince its debut on January 31, 1999, episodes of \"Family Guy\" have been broadcast. Its seventeenth season began on September 30, 2018. \"Family Guy\" has been nominated for 12 Primetime Emmy Awards and 11 Annie Awards, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series, the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since \"The Flintstones\" in 1961. \"Family Guy\" has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons to \"The Simpsons\".\n\nMany tie-in media have been released, including \"\", a straight-to-DVD special released in 2005; \"\", a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and Walter Murphy; a video game and pinball machine, released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by Harper Adult based on the \"Family Guy\" universe; and \"\" (2010), a series of parodies of the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation.\n\nA spin-off series, \"The Cleveland Show\", featuring Cleveland Brown, aired from September 27, 2009, to May 19, 2013. \"The Simpsons Guy\", a crossover episode with \"The Simpsons\", aired on September 28, 2014. \"Family Guy\" is a joint production by Fuzzy Door Productions and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television. In 2013, \"TV Guide\" ranked \"Family Guy\" the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.\n\nOn May 12, 2018, Fox renewed the series for a seventeenth season, which premiered on September 30, 2018.\n\nThe show revolves around the adventures of the Griffin family, consisting of father Peter Griffin, a bumbling yet well-intentioned blue-collar worker; Lois, a pretty stay-at-home mother and piano teacher who is a member of the wealthy Pewterschmidt family; Meg, their often-bullied teenage daughter who is also constantly ridiculed or ignored by the family; Chris, their awkward teenage son, who is overweight, unintelligent and, in many respects, is simply a younger version of his father; and Stewie, their diabolical infant son of ambiguous sexual orientation who has adult mannerisms and uses stereotypical archvillain phrases. Living with the family is their witty, smoking, martini-swilling, sarcastic, English-speaking anthropomorphic dog Brian, though he is still considered a pet in many ways.\nRecurring characters appear alongside the Griffin family. These include the family's neighbors: sex-crazed airline pilot bachelor Quagmire; African-American deli owner Cleveland and his wife Loretta (later Donna); paraplegic police officer Joe, his wife Bonnie, their son Kevin and their baby daughter Susie; neurotic Jewish pharmacist Mort, his wife Muriel, and their geeky and annoying son Neil; and elderly child molester Herbert. TV news anchors Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa, and \"Blaccu-Weather\" meteorologist Ollie Williams also make frequent appearances. Actors Adam West and James Woods guest star as themselves in various episodes.\n\nThe primary setting of \"Family Guy\" is Quahog ( [pron. ko-hog or kwo-hog]), a fictional district of Providence, Rhode Island that was founded by Peter's ancestor, Griffin Peterson. MacFarlane resided in Providence during his time as a student at Rhode Island School of Design, and the show contains distinct Rhode Island landmarks similar to real-world locations. MacFarlane often borrows the names of Rhode Island locations and icons such as Pawtucket and Buddy Cianci for use in the show. MacFarlane, in an interview with a news program on WNAC-TV, Channel 64 in Providence, stated that the town is modeled after Cranston, Rhode Island.\n\nMacFarlane initially conceived \"Family Guy\" in 1995 while studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). During college, he created his thesis film entitled \"The Life of Larry\", which was submitted by his professor at RISD to Hanna-Barbera. MacFarlane was hired by the company. In 1996 MacFarlane created a sequel to \"The Life of Larry\" entitled \"Larry and Steve\", which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of Cartoon Network's \"World Premiere Toons\".\n\nExecutives at Fox saw the \"Larry\" shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled \"Family Guy\", based on the characters. Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000. Several aspects of \"Family Guy\" were inspired by the \"Larry shorts\". While he worked on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian. MacFarlane stated that the difference between \"The Life of Larry\" and \"Family Guy\" was that \"\"Life of Larry\" was shown primarily in my dorm room and \"Family Guy\" was shown after the Super Bowl.\" After the pilot aired, the series was given the green light. MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as \"The Simpsons\" and \"All in the Family\". Premises were drawn from several 1980s Saturday morning cartoons he watched as a child, such as \"The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang\" and \"Rubik, the Amazing Cube\".\n\nThe Griffin family first appeared on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998. \"Family Guy\" was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show \"MADtv\", but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought that that was the place to create a prime-time animation show. \"Family Guy\" was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as \"King of the Hill\", but the show was not bought until years later, when \"King of the Hill\" became successful. Fox ordered 13 episodes of \"Family Guy\" to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.\n\nMacFarlane has served as an executive producer during the show's entire history. The first executive producers were David Zuckerman, Lolee Aries, David Pritchard, and Mike Wolf. \"Family Guy\" has had many executive producers in its history, including Daniel Palladino, Kara Vallow, and Danny Smith. David A. Goodman joined the show as a co-executive producer in season three, and eventually became an executive producer. Alex Borstein, who voices Lois, worked as an executive and supervising producer for the fourth and fifth seasons.\n\nThe first team of writers assembled for the show consisted of Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker. The writing process of \"Family Guy\" generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it is given to the rest of the writers to read. These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason. The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.\n\nMacFarlane explains that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology \"Suspense\", which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like \"Death Has a Shadow\" and \"Mind Over Murder\". MacFarlane explained that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify, and the novelty wore off. For the first few months of production, the writers shared one office, lent to them by the \"King of the Hill\" production crew.\n\nCredited with 19 episodes, Steve Callaghan is the most prolific writer on \"Family Guy\" staff. Many of the writers that have left the show have gone on to create or produce other successful series. Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan co-wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom \"Scrubs\" during their eight-year run on the show, while also serving as co-producers and working their way up to executive producers. Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman left the show and went on to create the long-running and still ongoing adult animated series \"American Dad!\" MacFarlane is also a co-creator of \"American Dad!\" On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Barker had departed \"American Dad!\" during its run as well, after 10 seasons of serving as producer and co-showrunner over the series.\n\nDuring the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, official production of the show halted for most of December 2007 and for various periods afterward. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, which he termed \"a colossal dick move\" in an interview with \"Variety\". Though MacFarlane refused to work on the show, his contract under Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it would subsequently produce. Production officially resumed after the end of the strike, with regularly airing episodes recommencing on February 17, 2008. According to MacFarlane, in 2009, it costs about $2 million to make an episode of \"Family Guy\".\n\nDuring his September 2017 AMA on Reddit, MacFarlane revealed that he hadn't written for the show since 2010, focusing instead on production and voice acting.\n\n\"Family Guy\" officially premiered after Fox's broadcast of Super Bowl XXXIII on January 31, 1999, with \"Death Has a Shadow\". The show debuted to 22 million viewers, and immediately generated controversy regarding its adult content. The show returned on April 11, 1999, with \"I Never Met the Dead Man\". \"Family Guy\" garnered decent ratings in Fox's 8:30 pm slot on Sunday, scheduled between \"The Simpsons\" and \"The X-Files\". At the end of its first season, the show ranked at #33 in the Nielsen ratings, with 12.8 million households tuning in. The show launched its second season in a new time slot, Thursday at 9 pm, on September 23, 1999. \"Family Guy\" was pitted against NBC's \"Frasier\", and the series' ratings declined sharply. Subsequently, Fox removed \"Family Guy\" from its schedule, and began airing episodes irregularly. The show returned on March 7, 2000, at 8:30 pm on Tuesdays, where it was constantly beaten in the ratings by ABC's then-new breakout hit \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", coming in at #114 in the Nielsen ratings with 6.32 million households tuning in. Fox announced that the show had been canceled in May 2000, at the end of the second season. However, following a last-minute reprieve, on July 24, 2000, Fox ordered 13 additional episodes of \"Family Guy\" to form a third season.\n\nThe show returned November 8, 2001, once again in a tough time slot: Thursday nights at 8:00 pm ET; this slot brought it into competition with \"Survivor\" and \"Friends\" (a situation that was later referenced in \"\"). During its second and third seasons, Fox frequently moved the show around to different days and time slots with little or no notice and, consequently, the show's ratings suffered. Upon Fox's annual unveiling of its 2002 fall line-up on May 15, 2002, \"Family Guy\" was absent. Fox announced that the show had been officially canceled shortly thereafter.\n\nFox attempted to sell the rights for reruns of the show, but finding networks that were interested was difficult; Cartoon Network eventually bought the rights, \" basically for free\", according to the president of 20th Century Fox Television. \"Family Guy\" premiered in reruns on Adult Swim on April 20, 2003, and immediately became the block's top-rated program, dominating late-night viewing in its time period versus cable and broadcast competition, and boosting viewership by 239%. The complete first and second seasons were released on DVD the same week the show premiered on Adult Swim, and the show became a cult phenomenon, selling 400,000 copies within one month. Sales of the DVD set reached 2.2 million copies, becoming the best-selling television DVD of 2003 and the second-highest-selling television DVD ever, behind the first season of Comedy Central's \"Chappelle's Show\". The third-season DVD release also sold more than a million copies. The show's popularity in DVD sales and reruns rekindled Fox's interest, and, on May 20, 2004, Fox ordered 35 new episodes of \"Family Guy\", marking the first revival of a television show based on DVD sales.\n\n\"North by North Quahog\", which premiered May 1, 2005, was the first episode to be broadcast after the show's hiatus. It was written by MacFarlane and directed by Peter Shin. MacFarlane believed the show's three-year hiatus was beneficial because animated shows do not normally have hiatuses, and towards the end of their seasons, \"... you see a lot more sex jokes and \"bodily function\" jokes and signs of a fatigued staff that their brains are just fried\". With \"North by North Quahog\", the writing staff tried to keep the show \"[...] exactly as it was\" before its cancellation, and \"None of us had any desire to make it look any slicker\". The episode was watched by 11.85 million viewers, the show's highest ratings since the airing of the first season episode \"\".\n\nIn March 2007 comedian Carol Burnett filed a $6 million lawsuit against 20th Century Fox, claiming that her charwoman cartoon character had been portrayed on the show without her permission. She stated it was a trademark infringement, and that Fox violated her publicity rights. On June 4, 2007, United States District Judge Dean D. Pregerson rejected the lawsuit, stating that the parody was protected under the First Amendment, citing \"Hustler Magazine v. Falwell\" as a precedent.\n\nOn October 3, 2007, Bourne Co. Music Publishers filed a lawsuit accusing the show of infringing its copyright on the song \"When You Wish Upon a Star\", through a parody song entitled \"I Need a Jew\" appearing in the episode \"When You Wish Upon a Weinstein\". Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a \"thinly veiled\" copy of its music with antisemitic lyrics. Named in the suit were 20th Century Fox Film Corp., Fox Broadcasting Co., Cartoon Network, MacFarlane and Murphy; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages. Bourne argued that \"I Need a Jew\" uses the copyrighted melody of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in \"Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.\" On March 16, 2009, United States District Judge Deborah Batts held that \"Family Guy\" did not infringe on Bourne's copyright when it transformed the song for comical use in an episode.\n\nIn December 2007, \"Family Guy\" was again accused of copyright infringement when actor Art Metrano filed a lawsuit regarding a scene in \"\", in which Jesus performs Metrano's signature \"magic\" act involving absurd \"faux\" magical hand gestures while humming the distinctive tune \"Fine and Dandy\". 20th Century Fox, MacFarlane, Callaghan and Borstein were all named in the suit. In July 2009 a federal district court judge rejected Fox's motion to dismiss, saying that the first three fair use factors involved — \"purpose and character of the use\", \"nature of the infringed work\" and \"amount and substantiality of the taking\" — counted in Metrano's favor, while the fourth — \"economic impact\" — had to await more fact-finding. In denying the dismissal, the court held that the reference in the scene made light of Jesus and his followers — not Metrano or his act.\nThe case was settled out of court in 2010 with undisclosed terms.\n\nSeth MacFarlane voices three of the show's main characters: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, and Stewie Griffin. Since MacFarlane had a strong vision for these characters, he chose to voice them himself, believing it would be easier than for someone else to attempt it. MacFarlane drew inspiration for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film \"My Fair Lady\". MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time-only characters, most prominently those of the Griffins' neighbor Glenn Quagmire, news anchor Tom Tucker, and Lois' father, Carter Pewterschmidt.\n\nAlex Borstein voices Peter's wife Lois Griffin, Asian correspondent Tricia Takanawa, Loretta Brown, and Lois' mother, Barbara Pewterschmidt. Borstein was asked to provide a voice for the pilot while she was working on \"MADtv\". She had not met MacFarlane or seen any of his artwork, and said it was \"really sight unseen\". At the time, Borstein was performing in a stage show in Los Angeles. She played a redheaded mother whose voice she had based on one of her cousins.\n\nSeth Green primarily voices Chris Griffin and Neil Goldman. Green stated that he did an impression of the character Buffalo Bill from the thriller film \"The Silence of the Lambs\" during his audition.\n\nMila Kunis and Lacey Chabert have both voiced Meg Griffin. Chabert left the series because of time conflicts with schoolwork and her role on \"Party of Five\". When Kunis auditioned for the role, she was called back by MacFarlane, who instructed her to speak slower. He then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.\n\nMike Henry voices Cleveland Brown, Herbert, Bruce the Performance Artist, Consuela and the Greased-up Deaf Guy. Henry met MacFarlane at the Rhode Island School of Design, and kept in touch with him after they graduated. A few years later, MacFarlane contacted him about being part of the show; he agreed and came on as a writer and voice actor. During the show's first four seasons, he was credited as a guest star, but beginning with season five's \"Prick Up Your Ears\", he has been credited as a main cast member.\n\nOther recurring cast members include Patrick Warburton as Joe Swanson; Jennifer Tilly as Bonnie Swanson; John G. Brennan as Mort Goldman and Horace the bartender; Carlos Alazraqui as Jonathan Weed; Adam Carolla and Norm Macdonald as Death; Lori Alan as Diane Simmons; and Phil LaMarr as Ollie Williams and the judge. Fellow cartoonist Butch Hartman has made guest voice appearances in many episodes as various characters. Also, writer Danny Smith voices various recurring characters, such as Ernie the Giant Chicken. Alexandra Breckenridge also appears as many various characters. Adam West appeared as the eponymous Mayor Adam West, until his death in 2017.\n\nEpisodes often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians, and scientists. Many guest voices star as themselves. Leslie Uggams was the first to appear as herself, in the fourth episode of the first season, \"Mind Over Murder\". The episode \"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\" guest starred the entire cast of \"\", including Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, LeVar Burton, Gates McFadden, Michael Dorn, Wil Wheaton, Marina Sirtis, and even Denise Crosby (season 1 as Tasha Yar), playing themselves; this is the episode with the most guest stars of the seventh season.\n\nThe \"Road to\" episodes are a series of hallmark travel episodes. They are a parody of the seven \"Road to...\" comedy films starring Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. These episodes have always involved Stewie and Brian in some foreign, supernatural or science-fiction location, unrelated to the show's normal location in Quahog. The first, entitled \"Road to Rhode Island\", aired on May 30, 2000, during the second season. The episodes are known for featuring elaborate musical numbers, similar to the \"Road\" films. The episodes contain several trademarks, including a special version of the opening sequence, custom musical cues and musical numbers, and parodies of science fiction and fantasy films.\n\nThe original idea for the \"Road to\" episodes came from MacFarlane, as he is a fan of the films of Crosby, Hope and Lamour. The first episode was directed by Dan Povenmire, who would direct the rest of the \"Road to\" episodes until the episode \"Road to Rupert\", at which point he had left the show to create \"Phineas and Ferb\". Series regular Greg Colton then took over Povenmire's role as director of the \"Road to\" episodes.\n\nThe \"Road to\" episodes are generally considered by critics and fans to be some of the greatest in the series, thanks to the developing relationship between Stewie and Brian, and the strong plotlines of the episodes themselves.\n\n\"Family Guy\" uses the filmmaking technique of cutaways, which occur in the majority of \"Family Guy\" episodes. Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to current events and/or modern cultural icons.\n\nEarly episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie's \"super villain\" antics, such as his constant plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at matricide. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality. \"Family Guy\" often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters break the fourth wall by addressing the audience. For example, in \"North by North Quahog\", the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been canceled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like \"Dark Angel\", \"Titus\", \"Undeclared\", \"Action\", \"That '80s Show\", \"Wonderfalls\", \"Fastlane\", \"Andy Richter Controls the Universe\", \"Skin\", \"Girls Club\", \"Cracking Up\", \"The Pitts\", \"Firefly\", \"Get Real\", \"Freakylinks\", \"Wanda at Large\", \"Costello\", \"The Lone Gunmen\", \"A Minute with Stan Hooper\", \"Normal, Ohio\", \"Pasadena\", \"Harsh Realm\", \"Keen Eddie\", \"The $treet\", \"The American Embassy\", \"Cedric the Entertainer Presents\", \"The Tick\", \"Luis\", and \"Greg the Bunny\". Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during \"Family Guy\"s hiatus.\n\nThe show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have them. Notable expressions include Quagmire's \"Giggity giggity goo\", Peter's \"Freakin' sweet\", Cleveland's \"Oh, that's nasty\", and Joe's \"Bring it on!\" The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons. The episode \"Big Man on Hippocampus\" mocks catchphrase-based humor: when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, is introduced to Meg, he exclaims \"D'oh!\", to which Lois replies, \"No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase.\"\n\nIn 2016, a \"The New York Times\" study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that like other satirical comedies, \"Family Guy\" \"is most popular in cities. The show's popularity was more correlated with support for Hillary Clinton than any other show\". As of 2008, the franchise has generated in total revenue, including from TV syndication, from DVD sales, and from merchandise sales.\n\nCatherine Seipp of National Review Online described it as a \"nasty but extremely funny\" cartoon. Caryn James of \"The New York Times\" called it a show with an \"outrageously satirical family\" that \"includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies\". \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" named \"Family Guy\" the \"Show of the Week\" on April 21, 2009, hailing it a \"pop culture-heavy masterpiece\". Frazier Moore from \"The Seattle Times\" called it an \"endless craving for humor about bodily emissions\". He thought it was \"breathtakingly smart\" and said a \"blend of the ingenious with the raw helps account for its much broader appeal\". He summarized it as \"rude, crude and deliciously wrong\". \"The New Yorker\"s Nancy Franklin said that \"Family Guy\" is becoming one of the best animated shows; she commented on its ribaldry and popularity. The show has become a hit on Hulu; it is the second-highest viewed show after \"Saturday Night Live\". IGN called \"Family Guy\" a great show, and commented that it has gotten better since its revival. They stated that they cannot imagine another half-hour sitcom that provides as many laughs as \"Family Guy\". \"Empire\" praised the show and its writers for creating really hilarious moments with unlikely material. They commented that one of the reasons they love the show is because nothing is sacred—it makes jokes and gags of almost everything. Robin Pierson of \"The TV Critic\" praised the series as \"a different kind of animated comedy which clearly sets out to do jokes which other cartoons can't do.\" \"Family Guy\" has proven popular in the United Kingdom, regularly obtaining between 700,000 and 1 million viewers for re-runs on BBC Three.\n\nThe series has attracted many celebrities. Robert Downey Jr. telephoned the show production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode's creation, as his son is a fan of the show; the producers subsequently created a character for Downey. Lauren Conrad met MacFarlane while recording a \"\" clip for the episode \"Prick Up Your Ears\" (season 5, 2006). She has watched \"Family Guy\" for years and considers Stewie her favorite character. Commenting on his appearance in the episode \"Big Man on Hippocampus\" (season 8, 2010), actor Dwayne Johnson stated that he was a \"big fan\" of \"Family Guy\". Johnson befriended MacFarlane after he had a minor role in Johnson's 2010 film \"Tooth Fairy\". R&B singer Rihanna has admitted to being a fan of \"Family Guy\", as has pop singer Britney Spears; she tries to imitate Stewie's English accent. Spears, who was mocked for her personal problems in the \"South Park\" episode \"Britney's New Look\" in 2008, offered to appear in a cameo to hit back at the similar animated show, but MacFarlane declined, stating that he did not want to start a feud with the series.\n\n\"Family Guy\" and its cast have been nominated for 24 Emmy Awards, with 7 wins. MacFarlane won the Outstanding Voice-Over Performance award for his performance as Stewie; Murphy and MacFarlane won the Outstanding Music and Lyrics award for the song \"You Got a Lot to See\" from the episode \"Brian Wallows and Peter's Swallows\"; Steven Fonti won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode \"No Chris Left Behind\"; and Greg Colton won the Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation award for his storyboard work in the episode \"Road to the Multiverse\". The show was nominated for eleven Annie Awards, and won three times, twice in 2006 and once in 2008. In 2009 it was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, becoming the first animated program to be nominated in this category since \"The Flintstones\" in 1961. \"The Simpsons\" was almost nominated in 1993, but voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs. The show was nominated for a Grammy in 2011. \"Family Guy\" has been nominated and has won various other awards, including the Teen Choice Awards and the People's Choice Awards. In the 1,000th issue of \"Entertainment Weekly\", Brian Griffin was selected as the dog for \"The Perfect TV Family\".\" Wizard Magazine\" rated Stewie the 95th-greatest villain of all time. British newspaper \"The Times\" rated \"Family Guy\" as the 45th-best American show in 2009. IGN ranked \"Family Guy\" at number seven in the \"Top 100 Animated Series\" and number six in the \"Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time\". \"Empire\" named it the twelfth-greatest TV show of all time. In 2005 viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 voted \"Family Guy\" at number 5 on their list of the 100 Greatest Cartoons. Brian was awarded the 2009 Stoner of the Year award by \"High Times\" for the episode \"420\", marking the first time an animated character received the honor. In 2007 TV Guide ranked \"Family Guy\" number 15 in their list of top cult shows ever. \"Family Guy\" has garnered six Golden Reel Awards nominations, winning three times. In 2013, TV Guide ranked \"Family Guy\" the ninth Greatest TV Cartoon of All Time.\n\nOne of the initial critics to give the show negative reviews was Ken Tucker from \"Entertainment Weekly\"; he called it \"\"The Simpsons\" as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows\". The Parents Television Council (PTC), a conservative non-profit watchdog, has attacked the series since its premiere and has branded various episodes as \"Worst TV Show of the Week\". In May 2000 the PTC launched a letter-writing campaign to the Fox network in an effort to persuade the network to cancel the show. The PTC has placed the show on their annual lists of \"Worst Prime-Time Shows for Family Viewing\" in 2000, 2005, and 2006. The Federal Communications Commission has received multiple petitions requesting that the show be blocked from broadcasting on indecency grounds. Tucker and the PTC have both accused the show of portraying religion negatively, and of being racist. Because of the PTC, some advertisers have canceled their contracts after reviewing the content of the episodes, claiming it to be unsuitable. Critics have compared the show's humor and characters with those of \"The Simpsons\".\n\nVarious episodes of the show have generated controversy. In \"420\" (season seven, 2009) Brian decides to start a campaign to legalize cannabis in Quahog; the Venezuelan government reacted negatively to the episode and banned \"Family Guy\" from airing on their local networks, which generally syndicate American programming. Venezuelan justice minister Tareck El Aissami, citing the promotion of the use of cannabis, stated that any cable stations that did not stop airing the series would be fined; the government showed a clip which featured Brian and Stewie singing the praises of marijuana as a demonstration of how the United States supports cannabis use. In \"Extra Large Medium\" (season eight, 2010) a character named Ellen (who has Down syndrome) states that her mother is the former Governor of Alaska, which strongly implies that her mother is Sarah Palin, the only woman to have served in the office of governor in the state. Sarah Palin, the mother of a child with Down syndrome, criticized the episode in an appearance on \"The O'Reilly Factor\", calling those who made the show \"cruel, cold-hearted people.\"\n\n\"Family Guy\" premiered in Australia on April 9, 1999, on the Seven Network, in 2000 on Fox8, and on 7mate on September 27, 2010. In Canada, the series premiered January 31, 1999 on Global and September 1, 2003 on Teletoon. Beginning in the 2015–16 season, the show moved to City. In addition to Teletoon, the show has been syndicated to TVtropolis (now DTour), Adult Swim from July 4, 2012, and FXX. The show also airs in India on Star World Premiere, in Ireland on 3e, and in New Zealand on Four.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Family Guy\" premiered in September 1999, originally on Channel 4 and Sky One. In January 2005, FX (now Fox) began broadcasting the show. From October 2005, BBC Two started screening \"Family Guy\" before switching to BBC Three on September 2006. In March 2015, it was announced that season 14 of \"Family Guy\" and all of MacFarlane's other cartoons will transfer to ITV2, premiering on February 29, 2016, while the BBC would continue to hold the rights until 2017 for older episodes.\n\nFamily Guy: It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One was written by executive story editor Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and actress Alex Borstein. The book was first published on May 8, 2007. The book is a biographical monologue by Lois Griffin discussing her memories of growing up and to her attempted run for mayor in the town of Quahog. Though the book primarily consists of a loose narrative monologue by Lois, it is also interspersed with sections from other characters such as Peter Griffin. The book covers events featured in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\", with which it shares a title. It was published in the United Kingdom in 2007 by Orion Books.\n\nA comic book based on the \"Family Guy\" universe was produced. Published by Titan Comics, edited by Steve White and illustrated by Anthony Williams and S. L. Gallant. The writing and the illustrations will be supervised by the show's producers. The first comic book was released on July 27, 2011.\n\nAs promotion for the show, and, as Newman described, \"[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans\", Fox organized four \"Family Guy Live!\" performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the \"\" comedy album. The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 Montreal Comedy Festival. The \"Family Guy Live!\" performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.\n\nIn 2007, at the 59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song \"The Fellas At The Freakin' F.C.C.\" performed in the episode \"PTV\". The song insulted TV shows such as \"Two and a Half Men\", \"Desperate Housewives\", and \"Scrubs\", as well as the final scene of \"The Sopranos\".\n\nIn 2009, a special televised performance show aired entitled \"Family Guy Presents Seth & Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show\", in which voice actors Alex Borstein and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of Lady Gaga's song \"Poker Face\" in the voice of Marlee Matlin, who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance. Some new animated gags also appeared in the show.\n\nOn July 22, 2007, in an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", MacFarlane announced that he may start working on a feature film, although \"nothing's official.\" In \"TV Week\" on July 18, 2008, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a theatrically released \"Family Guy\" feature film sometime \"within the next year.\" He came up with an idea for the story, \"something that you could not do on the show, which [to him] is the only reason to do a movie.\" He later went to say he imagines the film to be \"an old-style musical with dialogue\" similar to \"The Sound of Music\", saying that he would \"really be trying to capture, musically, that feel.\" On October 13, 2011, Seth MacFarlane confirmed that a deal for a \"Family Guy\" film had been made, and that it would be written by himself and series co-producer Ricky Blitt.\n\nOn November 30, 2012, MacFarlane confirmed plans to produce a \"Family Guy\" film. The project was put on hold while MacFarlane worked on \"Ted 2\".\n\nOn August 10, 2018, Fox announced that a live-action/animated film based on the series is in development.\n\nMacFarlane co-created—alongside Mike Henry and Richard Appel—the \"Family Guy\" spin-off \"The Cleveland Show\", which premiered September 27, 2009. They began discussing the project in 2007.\n\nThe \"Family Guy Video Game!\" is a 2006 action game released by 2K Games and developed by High Voltage Software.\n\n\"\", which is centered around the episode \"Road to the Multiverse\", was released on November 20, 2012.\n\n\"\" launched on iOS and Android on April 10, 2014.\n\n\"Family Guy: Another Freakin' Mobile Game\" was released on iOS on April 25, 2017.\n\nAs of 2009, six books have been released about the \"Family Guy\" universe, all published by HarperCollins since 2005. The first, \"\" () by Steve Callahan, was released in April 26, 2005. Written in the style of a graphic novel, the plot follows Stewie's plans to rule the world. Other books include \"\" (), which covers the events of the episode \"It Takes a Village Idiot, and I Married One\"; and \"Family Guy and Philosophy: A Cure for the Petarded\" (), a collection of 17 essays exploring the connections between the series and historical philosophers. A book written from Brian's point of view (written by Andrew Goldberg) was published in 2006, called \"Brian Griffin's Guide to Booze, Broads and the Lost Art of Being a Man\".\n\n\"Family Guy\" has been commercially successful in the home market. The show was the first to be resurrected because of high DVD sales. The first volume, covering the show's first two seasons, sold 1.67 million units, topping TV DVD sales in 2003, while the second volume sold another million units. Volumes six and seven debuted at fifth place in United States DVD sales; volume seven was the highest-selling television DVD, selling 171,000 units by June 21, 2009. \"Family Guy Presents Blue Harvest\", the DVD featuring the \"Star Wars\" special \"Blue Harvest\", was released on January 15, 2008, and premiered at the top of United States DVD sales. The DVD was the first \"Family Guy\" DVD to include a digital copy for download to the iPod. In 2004, the first series of \"Family Guy\" toy figurines was released by Mezco Toyz; each member of the Griffin family had their own toy, with the exception of Stewie, of whom two different figures were made. Over the course of two years, four more series of toy figures were released, with various forms of Peter. In 2008, the character Peter appeared in advertisements for Subway Restaurants, promoting the restaurant's massive feast sandwich.\n\n\nInformational notes\nCitations\nBibliography\n\n"}

The son of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, he was married to Philippine Welser in his first marriage. In his second marriage to Anna Juliana Gonzaga, he was the father of Anna of Tyrol, the would-be Holy Roman Empress.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand of Austria was the second son of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary. He was a younger brother of Emperor Maximilian II. At the behest of his father, he was put in charge of the administration of Bohemia in 1547. He also led the campaign against the Turks in Hungary in 1556.\n\nIn 1557 he was secretly married to Philippine Welser, daughter of a patrician from Augsburg, with whom he had several children. The marriage was only accepted by Emperor Ferdinand I in 1559 under the condition of secrecy. The children were to receive the name \"of Austria\" but would only be entitled to inherit if the House of Habsburg became totally extinct in the male line, and thus the marriage had many qualities of a morganatic marriage. The sons born of this marriage received the title Margrave of Burgau, after the Margraviate of Burgau, an ancient Habsburg possession in Further Austria. The younger of the sons, who survived their father, later received the princely title of \"Fürst zu Burgau\".\n\nAfter his father's death in 1564, Ferdinand became the ruler of Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions under his father's will. However, he remained governor of Bohemia in Prague until 1567 according to the wishes of his brother Maximilian II.\n\nIn his own lands, Ferdinand made sure that the Catholic counter-reformation would prevail. He also was instrumental in promoting the Renaissance in central Europe and was an avid collector of art. He accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum built specifically for that purpose, making Ambras Castle Innsbruck the oldest museum in the world, and as the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle Innsbruck represents an unrivalled cultural monument. The collection was started during Ferdinand's time in Bohemia and he subsequently moved it to Tyrol. In particular, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities, the gallery of portraits, and the collection of armor were very expensive, leading Ferdinand to incurred a high level of debt. Part of collections remained in Innsbruck, and part ultimately was moved to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. \n\nAfter the death of his wife Philippine in 1580, he married Anna Caterina Gonzaga, a daughter of William I, Duke of Mantua, in 1582.\n\nArchduke Ferdinand died on 24 January 1595. Since his sons from the first marriage were not entitled to the inheritance, and the second produced only surviving daughters, Tirol was reunified with the other Habsburg lands. His daughter from the Mantuan marriage to Anna Caterina (later Anna Juliana) became Holy Roman Empress Anna, consort of Emperor Mathias, who received his Further Austrian inheritance.\n\nHe and his first wife Philippine Welser were parents of four children:\n\nOn 14 May 1582, Ferdinand married his niece Anne Catherine. She was a daughter of William I, Duke of Mantua, and Eleonora of Austria, younger sister of Ferdinand. They were parents to three daughters:\n\nHe had at least two illegitimate children:\n\n–With Anna von Obrizon:\n\n–With Johanna Lydl von Mayenburg:\n"}
{"id": "31657187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31657187", "title": "Filter bubble", "text": "Filter bubble\n\nA filter bubble – a term coined by Internet activist Eli Pariser – is a state of intellectual isolation that allegedly can result from personalized searches when a website algorithm selectively guesses what information a user would like to see based on information about the user, such as location, past click-behavior and search history. As a result, users become separated from information that disagrees with their viewpoints, effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. The choices made by these algorithms are not transparent. Prime examples include Google Personalized Search results and Facebook's personalized news-stream. The bubble effect may have negative implications for civic discourse, according to Pariser, but contrasting views regard the effect as minimal and addressable. The surprising results of the U.S. presidential election in 2016 have been associated with the influence of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, and as a result have called into question the effects of the \"filter bubble\" phenomenon on user exposure to fake news and echo chambers, spurring new interest in the term, with many concerned that the phenomenon may harm democracy.\n\nThe term was coined by Internet activist Eli Pariser circa 2010 and discussed in his 2011 book of the same name; according to Pariser, users get less exposure to conflicting viewpoints and are isolated intellectually in their own informational bubble. He related an example in which one user searched Google for \"BP\" and got investment news about British Petroleum, while another searcher got information about the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, and noted that the two search results pages were \"strikingly different\".\n\nPariser defined his concept of a filter bubble in more formal terms as \"that personal ecosystem of information that's been catered by these algorithms\". An Internet user's past browsing and search history is built up over time when they indicate interest in topics by \"clicking links, viewing friends, putting movies in [their] queue, reading news stories\", and so forth. An Internet firm then uses this information to target advertising to the user, or make certain types of information appear more prominently in search results pages. This process is not random either, and it operates under three step process. According to Eli Pariser's book, the process states, \"First, you figure out who people are and what they like. Then, you provide them with content and services that best fit them. Finally, you tune to get the fit just right. Your identity shapes your media.\" This portrays how we are allowing the media to formulate our thoughts because of the repeated messages we encounter daily.\n\nHow the filter bubbles and algorithms work according to a Wall Street Journal Study is, \"the top 50 Internet sites install 64 data-laden cookies and personal tracking beacons or tracking algorithms as stated above.\" Google specifically has 57 algorithms for the purpose of tailoring your searches. For example, searching a word like \"depression\" on Dictionary.com allows the site to install over 200 tracking algorithms on your computer so that websites can target you with antidepressants.\n\nOther terms have been used to describe this phenomenon, including \"ideological frames\" and \"the figurative sphere surrounding you as you search the Internet\". A related term, \"echo chamber\", was originally applied to news media, but is now applied to social media as well.\n\nPariser's idea of the filter bubble was popularized after the TED talk he gave in May 2011, in which he gives examples of how filter bubbles work and where they can be seen. In a test seeking to demonstrate the filter bubble effect, Pariser asked several friends to search for the word \"Egypt\" on Google and send him the results. Comparing two of the friends' first pages of results, while there was overlap between them on topics like news and travel, one friend's results prominently included links to information on the then-ongoing Egyptian revolution of 2011, while the other friend's first page of results did not include such links.\n\nIn \"The Filter Bubble\", Pariser warns that a potential downside to filtered searching is that it \"closes us off to new ideas, subjects, and important information\", and \"creates the impression that our narrow self-interest is all that exists\". It is potentially harmful to both individuals and society, in his view. He criticized Google and Facebook for offering users \"too much candy, and not enough carrots\". He warned that \"invisible algorithmic editing of the web\" may limit our exposure to new information and narrow our outlook. According to Pariser, the detrimental effects of filter bubbles include harm to the general society in the sense that they have the possibility of \"undermining civic discourse\" and making people more vulnerable to \"propaganda and manipulation\". He wrote:\n\nMany people are unaware that filter bubbles even exist. This can be seen in an article on The Guardian, which mentioned the fact that \"more than 60% of Facebook users are entirely unaware of any curation on Facebook at all, believing instead that every single story from their friends and followed pages appeared in their news feed.\" A brief explanation for how Facebook decides what goes on a user's news feed is through an algorithm which takes into account \"how you have interacted with similar posts in the past.\"\n\nA filter bubble has been described as exacerbating a phenomenon that has been called \"splinternet\" or \"cyberbalkanization\", which happens when the Internet becomes divided up into sub-groups of like-minded people who become insulated within their own online community and fail to get exposure to different views. This concern dates back to the early days of the publicly accessible Internet, with the term \"cyberbalkanization\" being coined in 1996.\n\nIn news media, echo chamber is a metaphorical description of a situation in which beliefs are amplified or reinforced by communication and repetition inside a closed system. By visiting an \"echo chamber\", people are able to seek out information which reinforces their existing views, potentially as an unconscious exercise of confirmation bias. This may increase political and social polarization and extremism.The term is a metaphor based on the acoustic echo chamber, where sounds reverberate in a hollow enclosure.\n\nBarack Obama's farewell address identified a similar concept to filter bubbles as a \"threat to [Americans'] democracy\", i.e., the \"retreat into our own bubbles, ...especially our social media feeds, surrounded by people who look like us and share the same political outlook and never challenge our assumptions... And increasingly we become so secure in our bubbles that we start accepting only information, whether it's true or not, that fits our opinions, instead of basing our opinions on the evidence that is out there.\"\n\nThere are conflicting reports about the extent to which personalized filtering is happening and whether such activity is beneficial or harmful. Analyst Jacob Weisberg, writing in June 2011 for \"Slate\", did a small non-scientific experiment to test Pariser's theory which involved five associates with different ideological backgrounds conducting a series of searches, \"John Boehner\", \"Barney Frank\", \"Ryan plan\", and \"Obamacare\", and sending Weisberg screenshots of their results. The results varied only in minor respects from person to person, and any differences did not appear to be ideology-related, leading Weisberg to conclude that a filter bubble was not in effect, and to write that the idea that most Internet users were \"feeding at the trough of a \"Daily Me\"\" was overblown. Weisberg asked Google to comment, and a spokesperson stated that algorithms were in place to deliberately \"limit personalization and promote variety\". Book reviewer Paul Boutin did a similar experiment to Weisberg's among people with differing search histories, and again found that the different searchers received nearly identical search results. Interviewing programmers at Google off the record journalist Per Grankvist found that user data used to play a bigger role in determining search results but that Google, through testing, found that the search query is by far the best determinator on what results to display.\n\nThere are reports that Google and other sites maintain vast \"dossiers\" of information on their users which might enable them to further personalize individual Internet experiences if they chose to do so. For instance, the technology exists for Google to keep track of users' past histories even if they don't have a personal Google account or are not logged into one. One report stated that Google had collected \"10 years' worth\" of information amassed from varying sources, such as Gmail, Google Maps, and other services besides its search engine, although a contrary report was that trying to personalize the Internet for each user was technically challenging for an Internet firm to achieve despite the huge amounts of available data. Analyst Doug Gross of CNN suggested that filtered searching seemed to be more helpful for consumers than for \"citizens\", and would help a consumer looking for \"pizza\" find local delivery options based on a personalized search and appropriately filter out distant pizza stores. Organizations such as the \"Washington Post\", \"The New York Times\", and others have experimented with creating new personalized information services, with the aim of tailoring search results to those that users are likely to like or agree with.\n\nA scientific study from Wharton that analyzed personalized recommendations also found that these filters can actually create commonality, not fragmentation, in online music taste. Consumers reportedly use the filters to expand their taste rather than to limit it. Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain disputed the extent to which personalization filters distort Google search results, saying that \"the effects of search personalization have been light\". Further, Google provides the ability for users to shut off personalization features if they choose, by deleting Google's record of their search history and setting Google to not remember their search keywords and visited links in the future.\n\nA study by researchers from Oxford, Stanford, and Microsoft examined the browsing histories of 1.2 million U.S. users of the Bing Toolbar add-on for Internet Explorer between March and May 2013. They selected 50,000 of those users who were active consumers of news, then classified whether the news outlets they visited were left- or right-leaning, based on whether the majority of voters in the counties associated with user IP addresses voted for Obama or Romney in the 2012 presidential election. They then identified whether news stories were read after accessing the publisher's site directly, via the Google News aggregation service, via web searches, or via social media. The researchers found that while web searches and social media do contribute to ideological segregation, the vast majority of online news consumption consisted of users directly visiting left- or right-leaning mainstream news sites, and consequently being exposed almost exclusively to views from a single side of the political spectrum. Limitations of the study included selection issues such as Internet Explorer users skewing higher in age than the general Internet population; Bing Toolbar usage and the voluntary (or unknowing) sharing of browsing history selecting for users who are less concerned about privacy; the assumption that all stories in left-leaning publications are left-leaning, and the same for right-leaning; and the possibility that users who are \"not\" active news consumers may get most of their news via social media, and thus experience stronger effects of social or algorithmic bias than those users who essentially self-select their bias through their choice of news publications (assuming they are aware of the publications' biases).\n\nWhile algorithms do limit political diversity, some of the filter bubble is the result of user choice. In a study by data scientists at Facebook, they found that for every four Facebook friends that share ideology, users have one friend with contrasting views. No matter what Facebook's algorithm for its News Feed is, people are simply more likely to befriend/follow people who share similar beliefs. The nature of the algorithm is that it ranks stories based on a user's history, resulting in a reduction of the \"politically cross-cutting content by 5 percent for conservatives and 8 percent for liberals\". However, even when people are given the option to click on a link offering contrasting views, they still default to their most viewed sources. \"[U]ser choice decreases the likelihood of clicking on a cross-cutting link by 17 percent for conservatives and 6 percent for liberals.\" A cross-cutting link is one that introduces a different point of view than the user's presumed point of view, or what the website has pegged as the user's beliefs.\n\nThe Facebook study found that it was \"inconclusive\" whether or not the algorithm played as big a role in filtering News Feeds as people assumed. The study also found that \"individual choice\", or confirmation bias, likewise affected what gets filtered out of News Feeds. Some social scientists criticized this conclusion though, because the point of protesting the filter bubble is that the algorithms and individual choice work together to filter out News Feeds. They also criticized Facebook's small sample size, which is about \"9% of actual Facebook users\", and the fact that the study results are \"not reproducible\" due to the fact that the study was conducted by \"Facebook scientists\" who had access to data that Facebook does not make available to outside researchers.\n\nThough the study found that only about 15–20% of the average user's Facebook friends subscribe to the opposite side of the political spectrum, Julia Kaman from Vox theorized that this could have potentially positive implications for viewpoint diversity. These \"friends\" are often acquaintances with whom we would not likely share our politics without the Internet. Facebook may foster a unique environment where a user sees and possibly interacts with content posted or re-posted by these \"second-tier\" friends. The study found that \"24 percent of the news items liberals saw were conservative-leaning and 38 percent of the news conservatives saw was liberal-leaning.\" \"Liberals tend to be connected to fewer friends who share information from the other side, compared with their conservative counterparts.\" This interplay has the ability to provide diverse information and sources that could moderate users' views.\n\nSimilarly, a study of Twitter's filter bubbles by New York University concluded that \"Individuals now have access to a wider span of viewpoints about news events, and most of this information is not coming through the traditional channels, but either directly from political actors or through their friends and relatives. Furthermore, the interactive nature of social media creates opportunities for individuals to discuss political events with their peers, including those with whom they have weak social ties\". According to these studies, social media may be diversifying information and opinions users come into contact with, though there is much speculation around filter bubbles and their ability to create deeper political polarization.\n\nWhen filter bubbles are in place they can create specific moments that scientists call 'Whoa' moments. A 'Whoa' moment is when an article, ad, post, etc. appears on your computer that is in relation to a current action or current use of an object. Scientists discovered this term after a young woman was performing her daily routine, which included drinking coffee, when she opened her computer and noticed an advertisement for the same brand of coffee that she was drinking. \"Sat down and opened up Facebook this morning while having my coffee, and there they were two ads for Nespresso. Kind of a 'whoa' moment when the product you're drinking pops up on the screen in front of you.\" 'Whoa' moments occur when people are \"found.\" Which means advertisement algorithms target specific users based on their 'click behavior' in order to increase their sale revenue. 'Whoa' moments can also ignite discipline in users to stick to a routine and commonality with a product.\n\nSeveral designers have developed tools to counteract the effects of filter bubbles (see ). Swiss radio station SRF voted the word \"filterblase\" (the German translation of filter bubble) word of the year 2016.\n\nIn \"The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You\", internet activist Eli Pariser highlights how the increasing occurrence of filter bubbles further emphasizes the value of one's bridging social capital as defined by Robert Putman. Indeed, while bonding capital corresponds on the one hand to the establishment of strong ties between like-minded people, thus reinforcing some sense of social homogeneity, bridging social capital on the other hand represents the creation of weak ties between people with potentially diverging interests and viewpoints, hence introducing significantly more heterogeneity. In that sense, high bridging capital is much more likely to promote social inclusion by increasing our exposure to a space where we address the problems that transcend our niches and narrow self interests. Fostering one's bridging capital – for example by connecting with more people in an informal setting – can therefore be an effective way to reduce the influence of the filter bubble phenomenon.\n\nUsers can in fact take many actions to burst through their filter bubbles, for example by making a conscious effort to evaluate what information they are exposing themselves to, and by thinking critically about whether they are engaging with a broad range of content. This view argues that users should change the psychology of how they approach media, rather than relying on technology to counteract their biases. Users can consciously avoid news sources that are unverifiable or weak. Chris Glushko, the VP of Marketing at IAB, advocates using \"fact-checking sites\" like \"Snopes.com\" to identify fake news. Technology can also play a valuable role in combating filter bubbles.\n\nWebsites such as \"allsides.com\" and \"hifromtheotherside.com\" aim to expose readers to different perspectives with diverse content. Some additional plug-ins aimed to help people step out of their filter bubbles and make them aware of their personal perspectives; thus, these media show content that contradicts with their beliefs and opinions. For instance, \"Escape Your Bubble\" asks users to indicate a specific political party they want to be more informed about. The plug-in will then suggest articles from well-established sources to read relating to that political party, encouraging users to become more educated about the other party. In addition to plug-ins, there are apps created with the mission of encouraging users to open their echo chambers. \"Read Across the Aisle\" is a news app that reveals whether or not users are reading from diverse new sources that include multiple perspectives. Each source is color coordinated, representing the political leaning of each article. When users only read news from one perspective, the app communicates that to the user and encourages readers to explore other sources with opposing viewpoints. Although apps and plug-ins are tools humans can use, Eli Pariser stated \"certainly, there is some individual responsibility here to really seek out new sources and people who aren't like you.\"\n\nSince web-based advertising can further the effect of the filter bubbles by exposing users to more of the same content, users can block much advertising by deleting their search history, turning off targeted ads, and downloading browser extensions. Extensions such as \"Escape your Bubble\" for Google Chrome aim to help curate content and prevent users from only being exposed to biased information, while Mozilla Firefox extensions such as \"Lightbeam\" and \"Self-Destructing Cookies\" enable users to visualize how their data is being tracked, and lets them remove some of the tracking cookies. Some use anonymous or non-personalised search engines such as \"YaCy\", \"duckduckgo\", \"StartPage\", \"Disconnect\", and \"Searx\" in order to prevent companies from gathering their web-search data. Swiss daily \"Neue Zürcher Zeitung\" is beta-testing a personalised news engine app which uses machine learning to guess what content a user is interested in, while \"always including an element of surprise\"; the idea is to mix in stories which a user is unlikely to have followed in the past.\n\nThe European Union is taking measures to lessen the effect of the filter bubble. The European Parliament is sponsoring inquiries into how filter bubbles affect people's ability to access diverse news. Additionally, it introduced a program aimed to educate citizens about social media. In the U.S., the CSCW panel suggests the use of news aggregator apps to broaden media consumers news intake. News aggregator apps scan all current news articles and direct you to different viewpoints regarding a certain topic. Users can also use a diversely-aware news balancer which visually shows the media consumer if they are leaning left or right when it comes to reading the news, indicating right-leaning with a bigger red bar or left-leaning with a bigger blue bar. A study evaluating this news balancer found \"a small but noticeable change in reading behavior, toward more balanced exposure, among users seeing the feedback, as compared to a control group\".\n\nIn light of recent concerns about information filtering on social media, Facebook acknowledged the presence of filter bubbles and has taken strides toward removing them. In January 2017, Facebook removed personalization from its Trending Topics list in response to problems with some users not seeing highly talked-about events there. Facebook's strategy is to reverse the Related Articles feature that it had implemented in 2013, which would post related news stories after the user read a shared article. Now, the revamped strategy would flip this process and post articles from different perspectives on the same topic. Facebook is also attempting to go through a vetting process whereby only articles from reputable sources will be shown. Along with the founder of Craigslist and a few others, Facebook has invested $14 million into efforts \"to increase trust in journalism around the world, and to better inform the public conversation\". The idea is that even if people are only reading posts shared from their friends, at least these posts will be credible.\n\nSimilarly, Google, as of January 30, 2018, has also acknowledged the existence of a filter bubble difficulties within its platform. Because current Google searches pull algorithmically ranked results based upon \"authoritativeness\" and \"relevancy\" which show and hide certain search results, Google is seeking to combat this. By training its search engine to recognize the intent of a search inquiry rather than the literal syntax of the question, Google is attempting to limit the size of filter bubbles. As of now, the initial phase of this training will be introduced in the second quarter of 2018. Questions that involve bias and/or controversial opinions will not be addressed until a later time, prompting a larger problem that exists still: whether the search engine acts either as an arbiter of truth or as a knowledgeable guide by which to make decisions by.\n\nIn April 2017 news surfaced that Facebook, Mozilla, and Craigslist Craig contributed to the majority of a $14M donation to CUNY's \"News Integrity Initiative,\" poised at eliminating fake news and creating more honest news media.\n\nLater, in August, Mozilla, whose services host the Firefox web engine, announced the formation of the Mozilla Information Trust Initiative (MITI). The MITI would serve as a collective effort to develop products, research, and community-based solutions to combat the effects of filter bubbles and the proliferation of fake news. Mozilla's Open Innovation team leads the initiative, striving to combat misinformation, with a specific focus on the product with regards to literacy, research and creative interventions.\n\nAs the popularity of cloud services increases, personalized algorithms used to construct filter bubbles are expected to become more widespread. Scholars have begun considering the effect of filter bubbles on the users of social media from an ethical standpoint, particularly concerning the areas of personal freedom, security, and information bias. Filter bubbles in popular social media and personalized search sites can determine the particular content seen by users, often without their direct consent or cognizance, due to the algorithms used to curate that content. Critics of the use of filter bubbles speculate that individuals may lose autonomy over their own social media experience and have their identities socially constructed as a result of the pervasiveness of filter bubbles.\n\nTechnologists, social media engineers, and computer specialists have also examined the prevalence of filter bubbles. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, and Eli Pariser, author of \"The Filter Bubble\", have even expressed concerns regarding the risks of privacy and information polarization. The information of the users of personalized search engines and social media platforms is not private, though some people believe it should be. The concern over privacy has resulted in a debate as to whether or not it is moral for information technologists to take users' online activity and manipulate future exposure to related information.\n\nSince the content seen by individual social media users is influenced by algorithms that produce filter bubbles, users of social media platforms are more susceptible to confirmation bias, and may be exposed to biased, misleading information. Social sorting and other unintentional discriminatory practices are also anticipated as a result of personalized filtering.\n\nIn light of the 2016 U.S. presidential election scholars have likewise expressed concerns about the effect of filter bubbles on democracy and democratic processes, as well as the rise of \"ideological media\". These scholars fear that users will be unable to \"[think] beyond [their] narrow self-interest\" as filter bubbles create personalized social feeds, isolating them from diverse points of view and their surrounding communities. Of particular interest is how filter bubbles manipulate news feeds via algorithms, which contributes to proliferation of \"fake news\" and may influence political leaning, including how users vote.\n\nRevelations in March 2018 of Cambridge Analytica's harvesting and use of user data for at least 87 million Facebook profiles during the 2016 presidential election highlight the ethical implications of filter bubbles. Co-Founder and whistleblower of Cambridge Analytica Christopher Wylie, detailed how the firm had the ability to develop \"psychographic\" profiles of those users and use the information to shape their voting behavior. Access to user data by third parties such as Cambridge Analytica can exasperate and amplify existing filter bubbles users have created, artificially increasing existing biases and further divide societies.\n\n\n\n"}

Four parchment leaves and a further quarter of a page have been preserved. They consist of three texts in the oldest Slovene dialect. Linguistic, stylistic and contextual analyses reveal that these are church texts of careful composition and literary form.\n\nThe precise date of the origin of the Freising Manuscripts cannot be exactly determined; the original text was probably written in the 9th century. In this liturgic and homiletic manuscript, three Slovene records were found and this miscellany was probably an episcopal manual (pontificals). The Freising Manuscripts in it were created between 972 and 1039, most likely before 1000. The main support for this dating is the writing, which was used in the centuries after Charlemagne and is named Carolingian minuscule.\n\nDuring the time of the writing of the two manuscripts (sermons on sin and repentance, a confessional form), Bishop Abraham was active (from 957 to 994) in Freising. It is believed that the manuscripts were written in the Möll River Valley in Carinthia. For this reason some linguists (e.g. Jernej Kopitar and Rajko Nahtigal) linked Abraham closely to the origin of the Freising Manuscripts and even attributed to him the authorship of one of the texts and suspected that he was of Slovene origin, although this was later disproven.\n\nThe manuscripts were discovered in Freising, Bavaria. The Slovene name \"Brižinski spomeniki\" (literally 'Brižinj Monuments') was coined by the Carinthian Slovene philologist Anton Janežič, who Slovenized the German name Freising to \"Brižinj\" in 1854. In 1803, the manuscript came to the Bavarian State Library in Munich and the Freising Manuscripts were discovered there in 1807. The texts were translated into modern Slovene in 1854 by the philologist Anton Janežič. Before World War II, a facsimile of the Freising Manuscripts was published by Silvester Škerl at \"Akademska založba\" (Academic Publisher) in Ljubljana.\n\nThe manuscripts are still kept at the Bavarian State Library in Munich and have left it only twice. In the 1970s, they were exhibited in the Vatican Museums. In May and June 2004, they were exhibited at the National and University Library in Ljubljana.\n\n\n"}

She is portrayed by Dawn French (who is 8 years older than Granger), described by the British Comedy Guide as \"the jolly, down-to-earth female vicar of Dibley, a small country village inhabited by oddballs. After overcoming the town's initial shock at her gender Geraldine helps to improve the village.\"\nMuch of the source of comedy comes from the way French plays the female vicar with her extroverted and fun-loving nature, frequent colourful language, and behaviour as a vicar which would usually be frowned on by the church.\n\nThe character made a debut in 1994, and on 15 March 2013, French reprised her role as Granger as part of her French and Saunders marathon on BBC Radio 2.\n\nGranger arrived at the parish church to a shocked congregation, leading her to remark: \"You were expecting a bloke - beard, bible, bad breath. And instead, you got a babe with a bob cut and a magnificent bosom.\" She is a bonne vivante and a liberal woman who enjoys nothing more than a good laugh, much to the consternation of her primary antagonist David Horton. Despite her fun-loving and sometimes outrageous behaviour, she is deeply caring and does her best to help those in her parish in any way she can. She is well aware of her obesity but seems to take a relatively laid-back attitude toward it. A self-confessed chocoholic, her favourite being Smarties and Curly Wurlys, she often will go on a diet only to break it within minutes by eating one of the innumerable chocolate bars that she has hidden throughout her house (even in hollowed-out Bibles). On one occasion, she gives up chocolate for Lent and nearly goes mad but does succeed. She has an enormous crush on actor Sean Bean.\n\nDespite her kind-hearted nature, Geraldine is not above occasional arrogance. In the second-season episode \"Celebrity Vicar\", after a spot on local radio led to several high-profile media appearances, Geraldine allowed fame to go to her head, and became overconfident and self-absorbed, caring more about her public image and TV career than she did about her parishioners or her duties as a priest. She was later humbled after the tabloids printed several offensive articles about the members of the village council, and she struggled to regain their trust.\n\nHer unusual first name Boadicea is revealed later in the series, much to David Horton's ongoing amusement, although in the final episode her full name is given as Geraldine Julie Andrews Dick van Dyke Supercalifragilisticexpialidocius Chim-Chiminey Chim-Chiminey Chim-Chim-Cheree Granger, the latter due to her mother's favourite book being \"Mary Poppins\" and the fact that the film was released in 1964, supposedly the year of Geraldine's birth. Geraldine celebrated her 40th birthday in an episode first broadcast on 1 January 2005. Dawn French was 48 at the time. \n\nHer best friend is Alice Tinker (Emma Chambers); at the end of each episode she tells a joke to Alice, but Alice rarely understands the humour. Geraldine was once going to marry David Horton but decided not to after all. In 2006, she receives a proposal from accountant Harry Jasper Kennedy and accepts by running around the village, screaming. In the final episode she marries him in a bizarre wedding with touches of \"Doctor Who\", including the two bridesmaids being dressed as Daleks and with parts of the church decorated with vegetables. She ends up getting married in her pyjamas because her wedding dress has been accidentally covered with mud by Owen Newitt.\n\n"}

From 1969 to 1993, she worked at the Natural History Museum. Between 1999 and 2006, she was the managing editor of the \"Journal of Zoology\".\n\nClutton-Brock was born on 6 September 1933 in London. She was the daughter of Alan Clutton-Brock (1904-1976), an art critic of \"The Times\" and Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge, and his first wife, Sheelah Mabel Stoney Archer. In 1936, she and her brother were sent to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to live with an aunt after the death of their mother in a car-accident. There, her brother died from polio. Juliet enjoyed the wildlife in her aunt's garden, but was terrified of snakes. Having returned to England after the end of the war in 1945, she was educated at Runton Hill School, an all-girls independent boarding school in Norfolk described as \"icy\" by Caroline Grigson. There she developed an interest in paleontology and studied the fossils in the nearby sea-cliffs.\n\nIn 1953, she took a course on Archaeological Techniques at the Institute of Archaeology, then an independent Institute and part of the University of London. Professor Frederick Zeuner, then Professor of Environmental Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology and one of the founders of zoo-archaeology recommended that she take a degree in zoology before undertaking further study in zooarchaeology. She therefore studied zoology at the Chelsea College of Science and Technology and graduated with a first class Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree. She returned to the Institute of Archaeology to undertake post-graduate study in zooarchaeology under Zeuner. She completed her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1962 with a thesis on \"mammalian faunas from sites in India and western Asia\". She also attended lectures by Gordon Childe, Kathleen Kenyon and Max Mallowan, which gave her a solid background in the archaeology of Central Europe and the Middle East. Her father had inherited Chastleton House in the Cotswolds (built in 1603) in 1955, and Clutton-Brock would spend her vacations there.\n\nClutton-Brock obtained part-time employment at the Natural History Museum and was a full-time senior research worker in the Mammal Section at the Natural History Museum, London from 1969 until her retirement in 1993, subsequently maintaining a position there as a research associate. She acted as an editor of the \"Journal of Zoology\" from 1994, and its managing editor between 1999 and 2006. \nIn 1976, Clutton-Brock became a member of the executive committee of the International Council for Archaeozoology during a meeting of the UISPP in Nice, and in 1982 organised a meeting of the International Council for Archaeozoology at the Institute of Archaeology on London together with Caroline Grigson.\n\nShe published more than 90 scientific reports, papers, books and popular articles on zooarchaeology and the history of domesticated mammals. Her most popular books include \"A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals\" (Cambridge University Press) and the \"Cat\", \"Dog\", and \"Horse\" volumes of the \"Eyewitness Books\" series (DK Publishing). Other works include \"Horse Power: A History of the Horse and the Donkey in Human Societies\" (Harvard University Press) and \"Cats: Ancient and Modern\" (also Harvard University Press). Her \"Natural History of Domesticated Mammals\" became the standard text-book for most zoo-archaeology courses in the UK and abroad.\n\nClutton-Brock married Peter Jewell (1925-1998), also a biologist and interested in zoo-archaeology, in 1958. Together, they had three daughters; Sarah, Rebecca and Topsy. In 1966, when Jewell was made Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of Nigeria, the family moved to Nsukka. They had to flee across the Niger in 1967 during the Biafran war. Jewell died in 1998.\n\nClutton-Brock was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London (FSA) on 3 May 1979. She was also an elected Fellow of the Zoological Society of London (FZS). Anneke Clason, Sebastian Payne and Hans-Peter Uerpmann published a festschrift in her honour in 1993, entitled \"Skeletons in Her Cupboard\".\n\n"}

{"id": "2868797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2868797", "title": "Legal executive", "text": "Legal executive\n\nLegal executives are a form of trained persons in the legal professional in certain jurisdictions. They often specialise in a particular area of law. The training that a Legal Executive undertakes usually includes both vocational training (a minimum of 3 years for those in England and Wales) and academic qualifications.\n\nLegal executives are associated with different membership bodies and different rights according to geographical regions. Legal executives are recognised in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and The Bahamas. There is no direct equivalent to a legal executive in Scotland. In England and Wales they hold Chartered status and are members of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx).\n\nChartered Legal Executives in England and Wales are lawyers. They can become partners in law firms and are eligible to become judges and advocates subject to meeting eligibility requirements. As lawyers, they are subject to stringent regulation and a code of ethics as with barristers and solicitors.\n\nChartered Legal Executives (formerly known as Fellows of CILEx) qualify after completing their CILEX training followed by a minimum of 3 years qualifying employment. Chartered Legal Executives may do a wide range of legal work although, like solicitors, they generally specialise in one area:\n\nAfter completing their academic training, trainee Legal Executives often occupy paralegal roles to satisfy the 3 year vocational stage of qualifying as Chartered Legal Executives.\n\nThe modern chartered legal executive evolved from the 19th-century managing clerk. When solicitor firms started to grow in the 19th century, they increasingly relied on an ever-expanding number of law clerks for drafting and organizing documents. Some of these clerks in turn became knowledgeable about the law and were allowed to manage their fellow clerks; hence, they were called managing clerks.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s England suffered a shortage of solicitors when population growth unexpectedly exceeded the number of entrants into the profession. To improve the availability of legal services, the Law Society began aggressive recruitment efforts to convince young people to choose law as a career. As part of this effort, the Law Society decided to turn the managing clerk into a true legal profession of its own and sponsored the ILEX's creation in 1963 as well as the change in title to legal executive. In the Law Society's own words, ILEX was intended \"to stimulate recruitment to the unadmitted ranks of the professional status [...] and would offer [...] a career with proper incentives.\"\n\nThe Institute of Legal Executives was granted a royal charter to chartered professional body status in October 2011 and on 30 January 2012, officially received its charter, from the Minister of Justice, Jonathan Djanogly and was officially launched as the 'Chartered Institute of Legal Executives'.\n\nThe Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx) was founded in 1892 as the Solicitors Managing Clerks' Association and became the Institute of Legal Executives, a company limited by guarantee, in 1963 with the support of the Law Society of England and Wales. In England and Wales the Institute of Legal Executives received a Royal Charter in early 2012 to become the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives (CILEx). Fully qualified members of CILEx in England and Wales are now therefore referred to as \"Chartered Legal Executives\".\n\nCILEx is a professional body which represents Chartered legal executive lawyers and other legal practitioners and law staff. It has around 20,000 members. All members of CILEx are independently regulated by ILEX Professional Standards (IPS), regardless of grade.\n\nTo qualify as a Chartered Legal Executive, aspiring Chartered Legal Executives undertake a series of training courses and are required to pass qualifications relevant to the area of practice in which they intend to specialise. The first stage for the full vocational route to qualifying is called the CILEx Level 3 Professional Diploma in Law and Practice and is set at the equivalent to A-level law. The second and final qualifications are equivalent to an honours degree course - the CILEx Level 6 Diploma in Law and Practice. Trainees will often work at the same time as studying in order to acquire practical skills. The courses can be undertaken at a college, university or through an open learning programme. The courses are open to graduates and non-graduates.\n\nA trainee must also gain 3 years' vocational experience before being admitted as a Fellow.\n\nOnly Fellows of CILEx (FCILEx) can lawfully hold themselves out as Chartered Legal Executives and are qualified by law (by way of CILEx) to be commissioners of oaths able to take depositions and affidavits. Fellows also can bring action in court and appear for clients in certain courts. Appearance in courts requires a separate CILEx qualification to become a Chartered Legal Executive Advocate. Fellows (that is, Chartered Legal Executives) are also eligible to apply and compete with barristers and solicitors for appointment to certain judicial offices, such as the position of deputy or district judge.\n\nIn September 2009, the CILEx training in England and Wales changed. The CILEx qualification now emphasises and examines the practical work of the law as well as continuing with the necessary academic examinations. At the same time, a number of new membership grades were introduced by CILEx. CILEx now offers the following membership categories which can be joined according to experience and qualifications held:\n\n\nStudents already holding a Legal Practice Course (LPC) or Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) qualifications are exempt from the CILEx academic qualifications and can immediately apply to become a graduate member. Graduate members must then work under the supervision of a qualified legal executive or a solicitor at a firm, either in-house at a private company or in government (provided their work is substantially of a legal rather than administrative nature). To apply to become a Fellow of the Chartered Institute they must have a minimum of three years' practical legal experience.\n\nOnce a student has successfully completed a period of qualifying employment, he or she will become a Fellow of CILEx, a qualified lawyer and will be allowed to hold themselves out as a Chartered Legal Executive and use the designatory letters FCILEx. Fellows (and other member grades) are required to maintain and improve their knowledge by undertaking CPD each year. A proportion of those hours must relate to their area of specialism. Fellows are issued an annual practising certificate. Only qualified and practicing Fellows of the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives may use the designatory title 'Chartered Legal Executives' which is a protected designation for practicing Fellows under its Royal Charter.\n\nA CILEx Fellow who wishes to go on to qualify as a solicitor is usually allowed to forego the training contract aspect. For this exemption to apply, they must have attained fellowship level by the time they complete the vocational stage of solicitor training, i.e. the LPC. It goes without saying they must also have completed the academic stage; however, having come through the CILEx route to qualification, this usually means taking advanced modules of the CILEx level-6 qualification.\n\nThe Institute of Legal Executives (Victoria) was set up in 1966 and represents legal executives in the state of Victoria, it works with the Institute of Legal Executives (Australia) which was formed in 1994 and represents legal executives in the rest of Australia. Both Legal Executives organisations in Australia work to formalise legal training and promote education for the position of Legal Executive. They award Diplomas, Certificates in Professional Legal studies, as well as prizes and bursaries for students.\nIn South Australia the law society provides an equivalent association for paralegals.\n\nThe Law Society of Hong Kong set benchmark standards for those using the title 'legal executive' in Hong Kong. HKUSPACE (an extension of the University of Hong Kong) runs two programs to meet the Law Society of Hong Kong benchmarks Legal executive may be given certain limited rights of audience in accordance with the Court’s Practice Direction to represent lay clients.\n\nThe Irish Institute of Legal Executives IILEX is the professional body representing legal executives in Ireland and with the stated aim to provide a system of training and examination and to obtain a recognised professional qualification for those engaged in legal work in Ireland.\n\n\nThe New Zealand Institute of Legal Executives is an incorporated society which advances and protects the status and interests of legal executives. At present it has approximately 650 members.\n\nIn The Bahamas, Legal Executives, like other members of the legal profession, are governed by and regulated in accordance with the provisions of the Legal Profession Act. The Legal Profession Act tasks the Registrar of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas with keeping a register which is known simply as the Register of Legal Executives.\n\nWhereas Legal Executives practising in England and Wales now enjoy certain rights of audience, in The Bahamas, Legal Executives may only appear before a particular tribunal or authority after the attorney-general has had consultations with the Bar Council of the Bahamas Bar Association.\n\nIn The Bahamas, under the Legal Profession Act, it is unlawful for a person to hold himself or herself out as a Legal Executive if their name does not appear on the Register of Legal Executives. Any person who is found to be guilty of pretending to be a Legal Executive can be liable upon conviction to a fine of B$5,000.00, or imprisonment for a period of three years, or both.\n\n"}
{"id": "441464", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=441464", "title": "Legend tripping", "text": "Legend tripping\n\nLegend tripping is a name bestowed by folklorists and anthropologists on an adolescent practice (containing elements of a rite of passage) in which a usually furtive nocturnal pilgrimage is made to a site which is alleged to have been the scene of some tragic, horrific, and possibly supernatural event or haunting. The practice has been documented most thoroughly to date in the United States.\n\nWhile the stories that attach to the sites of legend tripping vary from place to place, and sometimes contain a kernel of historical truth, there are a number of motifs and recurring themes in the legends and the sites. Abandoned buildings, remote bridges, tunnels, caves, rural roads, specific woods or other uninhabited (or semi-uninhabited) areas, and especially cemeteries are frequent sites of legend-tripping pilgrimages.\n\nLegend-tripping is a mostly harmless, perhaps even beneficial, youth recreation. It allows young people to demonstrate their courage in a place where the actual physical risk is likely slight. However, in what Ellis calls \"ostensive abuse,\" the rituals enacted at the legend-tripping sites sometimes involve trespassing, vandalism, and other misdemeanors, and sometimes acts of animal sacrifice or other blood ritual. These transgressions then sometimes lead to local moral panics that involve adults in the community, and sometimes even the mass media. These panics often further embellish the prestige of the legend trip to the adolescent mind. In at least one notorious case, years of destructive legend-tripping, amounting to an \"ostensive frenzy,\" led to the fatal shooting of a legend-tripper near Lincoln, Nebraska followed by the wounding of the woman whose house had become the focus of the ostension. The panic over youth Satanism in the 1980s was fueled in part by graffiti and other ritual activities engaged in by legend-tripping youths.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Walter N. Pahnke, a graduate student in theology at Harvard Divinity School, designed the experiment under the supervision of Timothy Leary and the Harvard Psilocybin Project. Pahnke's experiment investigated whether psilocybin (the active principle in psilocybin mushrooms) would act as a reliable entheogen in religiously predisposed subjects.\n\nPrior to the Good Friday service, graduate degree divinity student volunteers from the Boston area were randomly divided into two groups. In a double-blind experiment, half of the students received psilocybin, while a control group received a large dose of niacin. Niacin produces clear physiological changes and thus was used as an active placebo. In at least some cases, those who received the niacin initially believed they had received the psychoactive drug. However, the feeling of face flushing (turning red, feeling hot and tingly) produced by niacin subsided after about an hour after receiving the dose. However, the effects of the psilocybin intensified over the first few hours. \n\nAlmost all of the members of the experimental group reported experiencing profound religious experiences, providing empirical support for the notion that psychedelic drugs can facilitate religious experiences. One of the participants in the experiment was religious scholar Huston Smith, who would become an author of several textbooks on comparative religion. He later described his experience as \"the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced\".\n\nIn a 25-year follow-up to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of \"a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life\". Psychedelic researcher Rick Doblin considered Pahnke's original study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the double-blind procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, Doblin said that Pahnke's study cast \"a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects\". A similar sentiment was expressed by clinical psychologist William A. Richards, who in 2007 stated \"[psychedelic] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar, if not identical, to those that occur through so-called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry.\"\n\nIn 2002 (published in 2006), a more rigorously controlled version of this experiment was conducted at Johns Hopkins University by Roland R. Griffiths, yielding similar results. In a 14-month follow-up to this study, over half of the participants rated the experience among the top five most meaningful spiritual experiences in their lives, and considered the experience to have increased their personal well-being and life satisfaction.\n\n\n\n"}

The group was a parody of the Parents Television Council (PTC), which was protesting the level of violence and sexual content in WWF programming, and threatening to boycott several of their sponsors.\n\nThe Right to Censor uniform was a white button up shirt and black tie, with black slacks for the men (although Val Venis wore white slacks on occasion) and a long black skirt for the women, which parodies the look of a Mormon missionary. Eventually Ivory, the only woman recruited to the group, was forced to adopt the black slacks out of necessity, due to the skirt limiting her in-ring abilities.\n\nEntrances of RTC members were accompanied not by the standard musical theme but by the sound of shrill alarms and buzzers, with an underlying swing jazz beat, along with a monotone voice repeating the word \"warning\" over and over again.\n\nThe group was formed when wrestler Steven Richards began to randomly appear on WWF programming to cover up the bodies of scantily clad women or remove \"hardcore\" weapons such as tables from matches. He apparently took offense to the Acolytes' rowdy reputation and disapproved of the Dudleys' use of tables. He was eventually joined by Bull Buchanan, The Goodfather (formerly the Godfather), Val Venis, and Ivory. The group temporarily forced The Kat into its fold, but The Kat and the WWF parted ways before that storyline could completely play itself out. Before being forced into the group, The Kat was starting a group called Right to Nudity, which was to play on The Kat's infamous pay-per-view stunt where she appeared completely topless. Her group was what brought her to Right to Censor's attention.\n\nThe Right to Censor came out victorious in at least one match of every pay-per-view they participated in from mid-2000 to early 2001. At SummerSlam 2000, Richards, Buchanan, and The Goodfather won a 6-man tag match against Too Cool (Grandmaster Sexay and Scotty 2 Hotty) and Rikishi. At the next pay-per-view, Unforgiven, the RTC (now with Val Venis) won an 8-man tag match against the APA and the Dudley Boyz. Even though The Goodfather and Bull Buchanan lost the Dudley Invitational at No Mercy 2000, Venis and Richards managed to defeat Chyna and Mr. Ass in a tag match. When Women's Champion Ivory joined the group, she won 3 pay-per-view matches in a row for the group. She defeated Lita in a title match at Survivor Series 2000 while The Goodfather and Buchanan lost a Survivor Series Elimination Match. At Armageddon 2000, Ivory came out victorious once again in a triple-threat title match against Molly Holly and Trish Stratus, and Val Venis also was victorious over Chyna. Meanwhile, Buchanan and The Goodfather continued the losing streak when they lost the Tag Team titles to Edge and Christian in a Fatal Four-Way tag match. At the 2001 Royal Rumble, Ivory once again retained her title by defeating Chyna; on the other hand, Buchanan, The Goodfather, and Venis all failed in their attempt to win the Royal Rumble Match. No Way Out 2001 that year marked the last time the RTC would win a match at a pay-per-view when Steven Richards defeated Jerry Lawler.\n\nThe group had a moderate level of success, with Buchanan and The Goodfather holding the Tag Team Championship and Ivory capturing the WWF Women's Championship before entering into a high-profile feud with Chyna.\n\n\"WrestleMania X-Seven\" was the symbolic end of the Right to Censor, as the stable lost all of the matches they were scheduled to participate in, Buchanan, Venis, and The Goodfather lost a 6-man tag match against the APA and Tazz while Ivory lost her title to Chyna.\n\nOn the April 26, 2001 episode of SmackDown!, Richards, Buchanan, Val Venis, and The Goodfather faced the Undertaker in a 4-on-1 handicap match. The group was finally disbanded when Steven Richards was hit with the Last Ride by The Undertaker. The Goodfather, Buchanan and Val Venis all walked out and left him lying in the ring. The group’s last match was contested on May 24, 2001 on SmackDown!, when Bull Buchanan, The Goodfather & Ivory lost to Steve Blackman, Grand Master Sexay & Trish Stratus in a tag match. Following this match, RTC was officially disbanded, with Ivory appearing for the last time under the Right to Censor gimmick on the June 16, 2001 episode of Metal. Ivory & Steven Richards would return as members of WCW/ECW Alliance during the Invasion angle and Val Venis & Goodfather returned at the 2002 Royal Rumble under their old personas. Steven Richards adopted a psychotic gimmick while Bull Buchanan was briefly rebranded as B (B-Squared) and made a bodyguard for John Cena before departing the WWE. The rest of the group reverted to their previous personas before the advent of the faction.\n\n"}

Saint-Étienne is the capital of the Loire department and has a population of approximately 172,023 (2013) in the city itself and over 508,000 in the metropolitan area (2011).\n\nIn the last years Saint-Étienne made important transformations for transitioning from a 19th century industrial city to the 21st century \"European capital of design\". This approach led to important urban renovations of the main districts of the city.\n\nNamed after Saint Stephen, the city first appears in the historical record in the Middle Ages as \"Saint-Étienne de Furan\" (after the River Furan, a tributary of the Loire). In the 13th century, it was a small borough around the church dedicated to Saint Etienne. On the upper reaches of the Furan, near the Way of St. James, the Abbey of Valbenoîte had been founded by the cistercians in 1222. In the late 15th century, it was a fortified village defended by walls built around the original nucleus.\n\nFrom the 16th century, Saint-Étienne developed an arms manufacturing industry and became a market town. It was this which accounted for the town's importance, although it also became a centre for the manufacture of ribbons and passementerie starting in the 17th century. During the French revolution, Saint-Étienne was briefly renamed Armeville – 'arms town' – because of this activity.\n\nLater, it became a mining centre of the Loire coal mining basin, and more recently, has become known for its bicycle industry.\n\nIn the first half of the 19th century, it was only a chief town of an arrondissement in the ' of the Loire, with a population of 33,064 in 1832. The concentration of industry prompted these numbers to rise rapidly to 110,000 by about 1880. It was this growing importance of Saint-Étienne that led to its being made seat of the prefecture and the departmental administration on 25 July 1855, when it became the chief town in the ' and seat of the prefect, replacing Montbrison, which was reduced to the status of chief town of an . Saint-Étienne absorbed the commune of Valbenoîte and several other neighbouring localities on 31 March 1855.\n\nPopulation of the city at the 1999 census was 180,210 (177,300 as of February 2004 estimates). Population of the whole metropolitan area at the 1999 census was 321,703.\n\nInhabitants of Saint-Étienne are called \"Stéphanois\" in French. They are named so because \"Étienne\" derives from the Greek \"Stephanos\".\n\nSaint-Étienne became a popular stop for automobile travelers in the early 20th century (sometimes referred to as The Golden Age of Travel).\n\nIn 1998, Saint-Étienne set up a design biennale – the largest of its kind in France. It lasts around two weeks. A landmark in the history of the importance ascribed to design in Saint-Étienne was the inauguration of \"La Cité du design\" on the site of the former arms factory in 2009.\n\nThe city also launched the Massenet Festivals, (the composer Jules Massenet hailed from the area) devoted mainly to perform Massenet's operas. In 2000, the city was named one of the French Towns and Lands of Art and History. On 22 November 2010, it was nominated as \"City of Design\" as part of UNESCO’s Creative Cities Network.\n\nSaint-Étienne has four museums:\n\n\nSaint-Étienne has an anormal type of the oceanic climate that is heavily influenced by its relative distance to the sea. Summer days are very warm for a marine climate type, but fall into the range due to the cool nights that keep the mean average temperatures below the subtropical threshold of . Winters are cool but rarely very cold, although minor frosts are common. Precipitation levels are very low for this type of climate regime during winter, although the wet and humid summers compensate.\n\nThe city's football club AS Saint-Étienne has won the Ligue 1 title a record ten times, achieving most of their success in the 1970s. British indie-dance band Saint Etienne named themselves after the club.\n\nSt. Étienne has many sports stadiums, the largest being Stade Geoffroy-Guichard used for football and Stade Henri-Lux for athletics. St. Étienne was the capital of the French bicycle industry. The bicycle wheel manufacturer Mavic is based in the city and frame manufacturers Motobécane and Vitus are also based here. The city often hosts a stage of the Tour de France.\n\nSt. Étienne resident Thierry Gueorgiou is a world champion in orienteering. The local rugby union team is CA Saint-Étienne Loire Sud Rugby.\n\nThe nearest airport is Saint-Étienne - Bouthéon Airport which is located in Andrézieux-Bouthéon, north-northwest of Saint-Étienne. The main railway station is Gare de Saint-Étienne-Châteaucreux, which offers high speed services to Paris, Lyon (Saint-Étienne–Lyon railway), and several regional lines.\n\nSaint-Étienne is also notable for its tramway (Saint-Étienne tramway) – which uniquely with Lille, it kept throughout the 20th century – and its trolleybus system (Saint-Étienne trolleybus system) – which is one of only three such systems currently operating in France.\n\nBus and tram transport is regulated and provided by the Société de Transports de l'Agglomération Stéphanoise (STAS), a public transport executive organisation.\n\nThe bicycle sharing system Vélivert with 280 short term renting bicycles has been available since June 2010.\n\n\nSaint-Étienne was the birthplace of\n\nIt was also the place where Andrei Kivilev died.\n\nSaint-Étienne is twinned with:\n\n\n"}

Five percent of teachers in urban schools were physically attacked, with smaller percentages in suburban and rural schools. Other members of school staffs are also at risk for violent attack, with school bus drivers being particularly vulnerable.\n\nDuring 2007–08, teachers’ reports of being threatened or physically attacked by students varied according to the instructional level of their school. A greater percentage of secondary school teachers (8 percent) than elementary school teachers (7 percent) reported being threatened with injury by a student, and this pattern held for teachers in suburban schools as well as for teachers in rural schools (figure 5.2 and table 5.1).\n\nIn 2005, on a school bus in Montgomery County, Maryland, an 11-year-old girl was attacked by a group of several older boys who, the girl said, grabbed her breasts and feigned sex acts. Also in 2005 on a school bus in Colonial Heights, Virginia, south of Richmond, three boys and two girls aged 8 to 13 held an 11-year-old girl down in the back of the bus and sexually assaulted her. In the Maryland case, the child's mother, not the school, called the police, although a school administrator did notify the girl's mother (the students were not charged with sexual assault because the police mishandled the paperwork). In the Virginia case, the girl told her mother and was taken to a police station, prompting coordinated investigations by the police and the school. The bus driver testified she saw the incident happening but never stopped the bus. The girl was dropped off at her normal bus stop.\n\nIn 2008, the Baltimore School District failed to intervene in an act of violence committed against a teacher. A student had taken a video of a peer beating her art teacher. School officials ignored the problem until the video was posted on MySpace. Some cases of school violence have not been brought to the attention of the authorities because school administrators have not wanted their schools labeled unsafe under the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act. With or without NCLB, in the US, there has been a history of underreporting violent incidents occurring in schools.\n\nSchool shootings are rare and unusual forms of school violence, and account for less than 1% of violent crimes in public schools, with an average of 16.5 deaths per year from 2001–2008. There exists an uneven number of male versus female perpetrators of school shootings, where males outnumber females. Some commentators claim that media coverage encourages school violence. On the other hand, the press would likely have been faulted if it did not cover serious threats to public safety such as the Virginia Tech massacre, Columbine massacre, and Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.\n\n"}

Co-authored with Elizabeth DePoy, Gilson developed \"Explanatory Legitimacy Theory\". Through that lens, Gilson analyzes how population group membership is assigned, is based on political purpose, and is met with formal responses that serve both intentionally and unintentionally to perpetuate segregation, economic status quo, and inter-group tension. Additionally, co-authored with DePoy, Gilson developed \"Disjuncture Theory\". This theory explains disability as an interactive “ill-fit” between bodies (broadly defined) and environments (broadly defined).\n\nGilson has applied legitimacy theory and disjuncture theory to the analysis and enactment of health policy and practices related to access and to illness prevention. Along with DePoy, Gilson has implemented his vision of socially just policy based on universal access principles through the creation of a web portal that renders existing illness prevention information accessible to individuals across diversity category boundaries.\n\nGilson has received invitations to keynote at national and international conferences on disability studies and distinguished lectures at University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, Smith College, NYU, University of North Carolina, Ono Academic College, Research Institute for Health and Medical Professions, and others.\n\nGilson was born in 1950 in Long Beach, California, to a family of three—an older brother, Michael, and his mother and father, Janet and Arnold Gilson. Later, in 1955, a younger sister, Nancy, would join them. He spent years as an artist before earning a BA in 1973, and PhD in 1991 from the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nIn \"Rethinking Disability\", first published in 2004, and \"Disability as Disjuncture\", currently in press, Gilson with co-author Elizabeth DePoy, takes on the essentialist nature of current diversity categories with a particular focus on disability, laying bare the value foundation and political and economic purpose of “disability category” assignment and social, professional and community response. His subsequent works, also co-authored with DePoy, include \"The Human Experience\", published in 2007, \"Evaluation Practice\" (2008), \"Studying Disability\" (2010), and selected essays and papers. This scholarship applies legitimacy and disjuncture theories to understanding theories of human description and explanation and their purposive, political use in diverse “helping professional” worlds.\n\nRecently, Gilson, with co-author DePoy, applies design theory and practice to the analysis of diversity categories, their membership and their maintenance. In his non-profit work, he has applied this theory to the development of inexpensive, aesthetically designed prototypes, strategies, and products that enhance the ability of all people to engage in healthy behaviors. In the spring 2010, Gilson received funding to study campus architectures as symbols of campus cultural policy. He has also applied design and branding to the development of robotics for non-stigmatized augmentation of human function.\n\nGilson is currently professor and co-coordinator of Interdisciplinary Disability Studies at the University of Maine and a principal of ASTOS Innovations, a non-profit corporation devoted to improving equality of access to community resources in local, national, and global environments. ASTOS Innovations designs and develops model access solutions. Gilson also holds an appointment as Senior Research Fellow.

The name derives from the Latin \"tellus\", meaning Earth.\n\nThe original Tellurometer, known as the Micro-Distancer MRA 1, was introduced in 1957. It was invented by Dr. Trevor Lloyd Wadley of the Telecommunications Research Laboratory of the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), also responsible for the Wadley Loop receiver, which allowed precision tuning over wide bands, a task that had previously required switching out multiple crystals.\n\nThe Tellurometer emits an electronic wave: the remote station reradiates the incoming wave in a similar wave of more complex modulation, and the resulting phase shift was a measure of the distance travelled. The results appear on a cathode ray tube with circular sweep. This instrument penetrates haze and mist in daylight or darkness and has a normal range of 30–50 km but can extend up to 70 km.\n\nThe Tellurometer design yields high accuracy distance measurements over geodetic distances, but it is also useful for second order survey work, especially in areas where the terrain was rough and/or the temperatures extreme.\n\nExamples of remote locations mapped using Tellurometer surveys are Adams Bluff, Churchill Mountains, Cook Mountains, Jacobsen Glacier, Mount Albright, Mount Predoehl, Mount Summerson, Sherwin Peak and Vogt Peak.\n\nThe MRB2 or Hydrodist was a marine version that was used in coastal surveys and calibrating ships using other survey navigation systems.\n\nThey were used by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam in the late 1960s.\n\nPlessey, the British electronics company, formed a new subsidiary known as \"Tellurometer (Pty) Limited\" in the 1960s to manufacture the product and to develop and sell derivatives. The Company subsequently introduced numerical displays, solid state transmitters, integrated circuits and eventually microprocessors for the product.\n\n"}

{"id": "30494448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30494448", "title": "Tolerance tax", "text": "Tolerance tax\n\nTolerance tax (Toleranzgebührer) was a tax that was levied against Jews of Hungary, then part of the Austrian Empire, between 1747 and 1797.\n\nThe tax was based on the German statute that a Jew was obliged to pay a certain tax to be \"tolerated\".\n\nIn 1747, during the reign of Empress Maria Theresa, the Jews of Hungary were taxed for the privilege of remaining in the empire, and were threatened with expulsion if they did not pay. \n\nOn September 1, 1749, the delegates of the Hungarian Jews, except those from Szatmár County, assembled at Pressburg and met a royal commission, which informed them that they would be expelled from the country if they did not pay this tax. The frightened Jews at once agreed to do so; and the commission then demanded a yearly tax of 50,000 gulden. This sum being excessive, the delegates protested; and although the queen had fixed 30,000 gulden as the minimum tax, they were finally able to compromise on the payment of 20,000 gulden a year for a period of eight years. The delegates were to apportion this amount among the districts; the districts, their respective sums among the communities; and the communities, theirs among the individual members.\n\nThe queen confirmed this agreement of the commission, except the eight-year clause, changing the period to three years, which she subsequently made five. The agreement, thus ratified by the queen, was brought on November 26 before the courts, which were powerless to relieve the Jews from the payment of this \"Malkegeld\" (queen's money), as they called it.\n\nThe Jews, thus burdened by new taxes, thought the time ripe for taking steps to remove their oppressive disabilities. While still at Presburg the delegates had brought their grievances before the mixed commission that was called \"delegata in puncto tolerantialis taxae et gravaminum Judeorum commissio mixta\". These complaints pictured the distress of the Jews of that time. They were not allowed to live in Croatia and Slavonia, in Baranya and Heves Counties, or in several free royal towns and localities; nor might they visit the markets there. At Stuhlweissenburg (Székesfehérvár) they had to pay a poll-tax of 1 gulden, 30 kreuzer if they entered the city during the day, if only for an hour. In many places they might not even stay overnight. They therefore begged permission to settle, or at least to visit the fairs, in Croatia and Slavonia and in those places from which they had been driven in consequence of the jealousy of the Greeks and the merchants.\n\nThe Jews also had to pay heavier bridge-and ferry-tolls than the Christians; at Nagyszombat (Trnava) they had to pay three times the ordinary sum, namely, for the driver, for the vehicle, and for the animal drawing the same; and in three villages belonging to the same district they had to pay toll, although there was no toll-gate. Jews living on the estates of the nobles had to give their wives and children as pledges for arrears of taxes. In Upper Hungary they asked for the revocation of the Tolerance tax imposed by the chamber of Zips County (Szepes, Spiš), on the ground that otherwise the Jews living there would have to pay two such taxes; and they asked also to be relieved from a similar tax paid to the Diet. Finally, they requested that Jewish artisans might be allowed to follow their trades in their homes undisturbed.\n\nThe commission laid these complaints before the Queen, indicating the manner in which they could be relieved; and their suggestions were subsequently willed by the queen and made into law.\n\nThe queen relieved the Jews from the Tolerance tax in Upper Hungary only. In regard to the other complaints she ordered that the Jews should specify them in detail, and that the government should remedy them insofar as they came under its jurisdiction.\n\nThe Tolerance tax had hardly been instituted when Michael Hirsch petitioned the government to be appointed primate of the Hungarian Jews in order to be able to settle difficulties that might arise among them, and to collect the tax. The government did not recommend Hirsch, but decided that in case the Jews should refuse to pay, it might be advisable to appoint a primate to adjust the matter.\n\nBefore the end of the period of five years the delegates of the Jews again met the commission at Pressburg (Bratislava) and offered to increase the amount of their tax to 25,000 gulden a year if the queen would promise that it should remain at that sum for the next ten years. The queen had other plans, however; not only did she dismiss the renewed \"gravamina\" of the Jews, but rather imposed stiffer regulations upon them. Their tax of 20,000 gulden was increased to 30,000 gulden in 1760; to 50,000 in 1772; to 80,000 in 1778; and to 160,000 in 1813.\n\nThe method of calculating the Tolerance tax varied over time and location, according to the size of household, occupation, and income-producing assets.\n\nIn 1783, Emperor Joseph II, the son of Maria Theresa, allowed Jews to settle in Pest, while enacting a tolerance tax, which the Jews had to pay to the town.\n\nAfter 1789, the Jews paid a tolerance tax of 4 guilder per family, a tax on kosher meat, a marriage tax, a tax on the synagogues and cemeteries of 100 guilder per year, and a quota tax of 50 guilder per year.\n\nIn 1797, after the death of Joseph II, the tolerance tax and the taxes on homes and properties were replaced by a candle tax on Jewish religious candles.\n\nIn Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia, further rights were granted to Jews in 1840, but the \"tolerance tax\" remained in force. \n\n"}

{"id": "38857166", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38857166", "title": "Women in the Arab Spring", "text": "Women in the Arab Spring\n\nWomen played a variety of roles in the Arab Spring, but its impact on women and their rights is unclear. The Arab Spring was a series of demonstrations, protests, and civil wars against authoritarian regimes that started in Tunisia and spread to much of the Arab world. The leaders of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen were overthrown; Bahrain has experienced sustained civil disorder, and the protests in Syria have become a civil war. Other Arab countries experienced protests as well.\n\nAt this time, women's political participation was expanding greatly compared to before. They were participating in anti-government demonstrations and the protection of their rights for higher education by establishing a higher education system. Egyptian women have had a history of being active members of trade unions, organizations, informal networks, and online communities. Even though there are only a few women in politics in Egypt, those involved have advanced activism. Women's involvement in the Arab Spring went beyond direct participation in the protests to include cyberactivism. Social media has enabled women to be able to contribute to demonstrations as organizers, journalists, and political activists. Arab women played a key role in changing the views of many. They were important revolutionists during the Arab Spring, and many activists hoped the Spring would boost women's rights, but its impact has not matched expectations. Women face discrimination in the Arab world and since expanding their roles and participation was not a priority for other revolutionary forces, they ended up sacrificing a lot with no gain in the end. Islamist parties have risen to power in states that experienced changes of government, and some view their power as a major threat to women's status.\n\nSixty percent of the population of the Arab world is under the age of 30, and over half are female. The Arab Spring countries have a poor record on most gender issues, but have successfully reduced gender gaps in areas like education and healthcare. In the years leading up to the Arab Spring, there had been an authoritarian form of government. These nations intended to make more comprehensive political frameworks that depended on the rule of law and accountable governance. Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya faced this distinctly. In Tunisia, a Revolution was taking place, and the people from neglected rural areas were holding demonstrations. These protesters were able to find a common cause which empowered them to start a labor movement that was direct it towards the capital. In Egypt, uprisings composed of urban and cosmopolitan people all throughout cities. Meanwhile, in Libya, ragtag groups of armed rebels in the eastern regions touched off the challenges, uncovering the tribal and territorial differences that have affected the nation for a considerable length of time. In spite of the fact that they shared a joint call for personal dignity and responsive government, the upsets over these three nations reflected economic grievances and social progression. Women of all-encompassing countries have taken the path to challenge the transgressions of their countries. This being particularly apparent during the anti-regime in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.\n\n\"Syrian women have been active in the fight against Bashar al-Assad's regime from the start, dating back to the peaceful demonstrations in early 2011 in the southern city of Dara'a.\" Unlike other armed conflicts, like the Iraq war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, women revolutionaries, both in and outside of Syria, have been involved in humanitarian efforts, providing food and medical supplies to displaced and injured citizens. Although women there have had the legal right to vote for years, the authoritarian nature of the old authoritarian regimes meant that both women and men had very few political rights. Freedom House, a non-governmental organization that promotes political freedom, stated that the Middle East and North Africa region \"has historically been the least free region in the world\". Even given the general democracy deficit, women had lower rates of political participation and representation in the legislatures.\n\nThe Arab Spring countries besides Yemen have largely closed the gender gap in education. The female literacy rate and female-to-male primary school enrollment rate have grown faster than in most other developing countries. In Tunisia, Libya, and Syria more women than men are enrolled in universities. Despite these high levels of educational achievement, female participation in the workforce remains low due to cultural norms. Societal pressures deter women from pursuing careers that are \"too successful,\" so many women choose to or are forced to follow the traditional route of staying at home and caring for the children. Women in urban areas or from the middle and upper classes tend to have more opportunities to break from traditional norms.\n\nCountries in the Middle East and North Africa have also improved women's health outcomes, resulting in one of the world's lowest excess female mortality rates (how many fewer women would have died each year had they been living in a high-income country). The region has reduced its maternal mortality and infant mortality rates and increased female life expectancy from 55 to 73 years in the past four decades. Birth rates are higher than in the developed world, but have been dropping as women stay in school longer and delay marriage.\n\nAll of the states in the Arab world are majority-Muslim and Islam plays an important role in social and political life. Neither the Quran nor the Hadith clearly defines the role of women in Islam, so the impact of Sharia law on women's rights varies depending on a country's interpretation of it and how it connects to local traditions. Most countries in the Arab world place family matters under the jurisdiction of religious rather than civil courts. Many countries have religiously-justified \"guardianship laws\" that give women the status of minors and make them dependent on spouses or male relatives. In Syria, marriage contracts are between the groom and the bride's father, and Syrian law does not recognize the concept of marital rape. However, official recognition of Islam does not necessarily reduce women's rights. Certain interpretations of Sharia define fertility decisions as a private matter. Tunisia's pre-Spring constitution named Islam as the state religion, but since the 1950s and 1960s its laws have been more secular and have supported some women's rights. Women in Tunisia have access to contraceptives and abortions; polygamy is illegal; there is a minimum marriage age; and women have many marital and divorce rights. However, daughters have fewer inheritance rights than sons and husbands take control of wives' property after marriage.\n\nPre-Spring regimes enacted some pro-women's rights policies. The regimes strongly opposed Islamist movements and these policies stemmed from the desire to make society more secular. In Egypt, Hosni Mubarak gave women the right to sue for divorce from their husbands and implemented a female-friendly quota system for elections. Observers credited his wife, Suzanne Mubarak, with pushing the reforms. Syria's Bashar al-Assad made it legal for news outlets to report on honor killings, although judges could still reduce penalties if murder was justified that way. Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi made it illegal for men to marry additional women without their current wives' consent. He also discouraged women from wearing the hijab, describing it as an \"act of the devil\" that forced women to \"sit at home.\" This policy drew criticism for reducing women's freedom to choose their attire, but it also promoted secularism.\n\nWomen helped spark the Arab Spring protests in several countries and actively participated in all of them. The demonstrations were based on the issues of freedom from tyranny and patriotism, not religious ones. Bahrain's uprising has had some religious influence because many protesters are Shi'ites angry about the Sunni monarchy's power and discrimination against Shi'ites. However, the protests promoted democracy and the end of discrimination rather than a religious agenda. Many women's rights activists hoped the revolutions would lead to more democracy and thereby more women's rights. However, they did not explicitly push for women's rights during any of the demonstrations.\n\nIndividual women had played key roles in starting the protests. On 17 December 2010, Tunisian policewoman Fedia Hamdi's confiscation of Mohamed Bouazizi's street vending wares led him to set himself on fire in protest. This incident provoked protests in his hometown of Sidi Bouzid and eventually spread throughout the country to become the Tunisian Revolution. His family members and outside observers have hypothesized that Hamdi's gender compounded his embarrassment and frustration and drove him to the point of immolating himself. As the protests spread, blogger Lina Ben Mhenni reported from the rural areas where the protests started, including covering the security forces' attack on protesters in Kasserine. Her work provided vital information to other Tunisian activists and brought the events there to the world's attention.\n\nIn Egypt, activist Asmaa Mahfouz posted a video urging Egyptians to protest the regime of Hosni Mubarak in Tahrir Square on 25 January 2011, which is National Police Day. Her video went viral and the 25 January protests drew a large crowd, setting off the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. Yemeni activist Tawakkol Karman organized protests and student rallies against the rule of Ali Abdullah Saleh, which culminated in the 2011 Yemeni revolution and the abdication of President Saleh. Yemenis referred to her as the \"Mother of the Revolution\" and she was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2011. Libyan human rights lawyer Salwa Bugaighis helped organize the \"Day of Rage\" protests on 17 February 2011. Those protests drove the Libyan army out of Benghazi, which marked a turning point in the Libyan Revolution.\n\nWomen were instrumental in every facet of the movement ascribing to a post-colonial feminism that rejected their powerlessness and gave them unique, thoughtful roles. While women joined men with a similar cause, to fight for regime change, they ultimately were pursuing different goals unique to their gendered status in society. In some cases women had set backs and suffered from more oppression than pre-Arab Spring. But, more than anything they made the issues of women's rights vulnerable again to conservative values. While a democratic election is a right for all citizens, women had very little influence on the election and most often a leader was chosen that did not address their concerns or bring justice for women.\n\nThousands of women of all ages, classes, and religions participated in the protests in every country. When the police became unable to provide neighborhood security, women organized their own street patrols and guarded each other's tents. Women in Libya smuggled medicine and weapons and gathered intelligence for the rebels as the protests turned into civil war.\n\nIn Egypt, a country notorious for high levels of sexual harassment, male protesters treated the female protesters respectfully. On the other hand, male protesters in Bahrain have formed human chains to block women from taking part, and in Yemen's Change Square a rope divided the men and women. The women were subject to the same or worse treatment as the male protesters, including being \"harassed, tortured, shot by snipers, and teargassed.\" Women who were imprisoned were threatened with sexual violence or subject to virginity tests, and in Libya there were reports of mass rape committed by government mercenaries.\n\nCoverage of women in the Arab spring came at a somewhat perplexing rate. While CNN and other major American news outlets covered muslim women more, they often gave them a passive role in the commentary of their coverage. Most of the women were also shown wearing hijabs and more traditional muslim clothing than before, pointing to a change in coverage by US media outlets. This, however, was not reflective of the realities of the Arab Spring.\n\nNew technologies, particularly social media, enabled women to participate in the Arab Spring as organizers, journalists, and activists. Protesters used Facebook to mobilize supporters and organize events, and YouTube videos and Flickr photos gave the rest of the world visuals of the events of the Spring. Twitter functioned as a live newsfeed for other domestic and international activists as well as international media organizations. Mobile phones, especially those with cameras and Internet access, served as a key tool for cyber-activists. Blogs were another vital method for women to disseminate information. The numbers of female and male bloggers from Arab Spring countries were relatively even.\nSince older males dominate most conventional media networks in the Arab Spring countries, cyber-activism gave women their own voice, both domestically and abroad. Younger women, generally the most excluded from traditional news outlets, thus benefited the most from the rise of social media. The new platforms also enabled protesters, both male and female, to get their messages out without the filter of state-run media. Social media helped women engage more people in the revolutions by reducing distinctions between social and political networks.\n\nWhile internet access remains relatively low in most of the Spring countries, the people whom online activities reached included key groups like power brokers, journalists, the intelligentsia, and Western governments and media. Women split their messaging evenly between raising domestic awareness of their causes and sharing information about the Spring with other countries, while men tended to focus only on domestic awareness. The use of social media allowed for an increased awareness of the contributions of individual women in the demonstrations. The women's updates ensured that the West's 24-hour news cycle always had firsthand sources. Bahraini activists Maryam Al-Khawaja and Zainab Al-Khawaja, Egyptian journalist Mona Eltahawy, and Libyan activist Danya Bashir were called the \"Twitterati\" (a portmanteau of \"Twitter\" and \"literati\") because their Twitter accounts of the revolutions were praised by international media outlets.\n\nSocial media plays a key role for women in Tunisia while they face political issues. The internet has become an alternative way for women to defend their rights and also women's mobilization. Having access to the internet has helped women in Tunisia become more visible to the public, they have utilized social networks such as Facebook to promote women's movements. In this space they are able to express their issues and allow their actions to be known. Even though the country is heavy on internet filtering and press censorship, information and communications technology and social networks have help mobilize the push for political change. A prime example is the fall of Ben Ali's regime, even though the battle was won in the streets a big part of the Tunisian revolution was due to the support of information and communications technology. Tunisian women took part of the fall of Ben Ali's on January 14, 2011 by engaging in unions, marches, demonstrations, and their activism done on social networks. Another blog that became viral was by Lina Ben Mhenni. Her blog, \"A Tunisian Girl\" was also talked about on the blogs of many other women. With Mhenni's courage and bravery she was able to cover the battle in the western Tunisia. Mhenni was awarded in 2011 the Deutsche Welle International Blog Award and El Mundo's International Journalism.\n\n\nNazeeha Saeed journalist arrested and tortured because she was a witness of crimes by police guards, she is travel banned.\n\nNedal Alsalman feminist and women human right defenders who became vocal and participated in all human right activities, at the moment she is one of the only human right defenders based on the ground, she is the acting president of Bahrain Centre for Human Rights after the arrest of president Nabeel Rajab\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome women's rights activists fear that the new Islamist-led governments in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya will curtail women's rights.\n\nIn January 2013, women in Saudi Arabia were allowed to sit on the Saudi Shura council if they are \"committed to Islamic Shariah disciplines without any violations\" and must be \"restrained by the religious veil.\" However, women in Saudi Arabia \"are not allowed to travel, work, study abroad, marry, get divorced or gain admittance to a public hospital without permission from a male guardian. Although Saudi Arabia \"experienced almost no mayhem during this Arab Spring\" (81), it was still ranked last in a study that was based on reports from women across the state based on issues such as freedom of person and economic rights. However, women in Saudi Arabia now have the right to vote. In 2015, the first year women were allowed to vote, multiple women were elected to different councils in the Saudi government, with King Abdullah adding 30 women to the Shura Council, which is a group of advisors. The male guardianship system is still an important part of Saudi society, even though Saudi Arabia has told the UN twice that it would abolish the system. One of Saudi Arabia's most senior clerics has said that repealing the system would threaten the existence of Saudi society and be a crime against the religion of Islam. Many activists hope that with the inclusion of more women in the workforce, Saudi society will be more open to this change. In September 2017, the Saudi Arabian government announced that women would receive the right to drive, effective June 2018.\n\nIn 2012, the General National Congress of Libya saw women obtain 33 of the 200 seats. However, there is controversy concerning whether or not women and men can mix in a public setting, which leads women parliamentarians and activists to believe that women will not be fairly represented in the new Constitution. Violence against women has also seen an increase, as the number of women who are being intimidated and threatened with sexual harassment, virginity tests, and incarceration is rising. These women are usually the women who are trying to be politically active, and who are also struggling to vote, but can't because they are being chased out of polling places by people who believe that men and women should not intermix. So far, the government does not appear to by trying to help stop this violence.\n\nOf the states that underwent change in the Middle East during the Arab Spring, Egypt was the first to hold democratic elections. As of 2012, Egypt had also seen some increase in the number of women who were in a seat of government, with 12 of the 498 seats in the Egyptian People's Assembly being occupied by women. This Assembly disbanded in 2013 and was replaced with the Constituent Assembly. The Constituent Assembly saw 6 seats out of the 100 go to women, all of whom walked out before the new constitution could be finished, which lead many Egyptian and United Nations legal experts to believe that the Constitution \"did not prevent discrimination against women or safeguard the limited women's rights inherent in the PSL (Personal Status Law)\". Due to the number of military sexual harassment cases, a movement called No To Military Trials helped to bring justice against the generals who committed the crimes. With the help of this movement, and laws passed that made sexual harassment a crime punishable with jail sentences and fines, the public sexual harassment surge is starting to slow down. Human rights groups are reporting that more women are reporting the crime and more men are being jailed for harassing. One organization reported that it had won more than 15 cases for sexual harassment between the years of 2013 and 2016. President Sissi has also helped combat the harassment, with seven men sentenced to life in prison, and two men sentenced to 20 years for their participation in assaults in Tahrir Square.\n\nIn Tunisia, the number of women who are participating in government is increasing, with women securing 61 of the 217 seats in the Tunisian Constituent Assembly in the 2012 elections. They have also gained many rights, such as the ability to obtain a divorce and gain custody of their children, and polygamy was also outlawed in the area. However, in Tunisia's new constitution, Elisabeth Johansson-Nogues notes that there is much controversy about the inclusion of gender specific amendments. In relation to the ambiguity of the language, there is no guarantee that women will be treated equally in society and the private sector. Because of this ambiguity, women are being publicly harassed for the way they dress, with very little help from the government in helping to stop it. In one case, \"...a young woman was raped by police officers and, when she took the officers to trial, was in turn charged by the justice system for public indecency...\". The government of Tunisia has yet to make a law protecting women against this type of violence.\n\nThe Arab Spring setback all economies involved in the conflict. While these Middle Eastern countries tried to reintegrate into the global economy, uncertainty about their political future shunned investors and did little to promote economic growth. With a large refugee crisis, unstable regional governments and currency, and a questionable future, many of these economies and countries will suffer compounding future effects. The Arab Spring could prove to be detrimental to women's rights for economic reasons as well. In a 2012 World Bank Report, they highlighted how greater access to economic resources can increase women's agency. As the economies of countries in the MENA region have suffered, slowing due to the Arab Spring, then so could the advancement of women's rights.\n\n\n"}
