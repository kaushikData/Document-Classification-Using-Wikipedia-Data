{"id": "3398101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3398101", "title": "Aztec calendar stone", "text": "Aztec calendar stone\n\nThe Aztec calendar stone is a late post-classic Mexica sculpture housed in the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico City, and is perhaps the most famous work of Aztec sculpture. The stone is in diameter and thick, and it weighs about . Shortly after the Spanish conquest, the monolithic sculpture was buried in the Zócalo, the main square of Mexico City. It was rediscovered on December 17, 1790 during repairs on the Mexico City Cathedral. Following its rediscovery, the calendar stone was mounted on an exterior wall of the Cathedral, where it remained until 1885. Most scholars think that the stone was carved some time between 1502 and 1521, though some believe that it is several decades older than that.\n\nThe monolith was carved in the Mesoamerican Postclassic Period, between 1250 and 1521 AD. There are no clear indications about the exact year of the size, authorship and purpose of the monolith, although there are certain references to the construction of a huge block of stone by the Mexicas in their last stage of splendor. According to Diego Duran the emperor Axayácatl \"was also busy in carving the famous and large stone, very carved where the figures of the months and years, days 21 and weeks were sculpted\"\n. For his part Juan de Torquemada \ndescribed in his Monarchy Indiana, how Moctezuma Xocoyotzin ordered to bring a large rock from Tenanitla, today San Angel, to Tenochtitlan, but on the way it fell on the bridge of the Xoloco neighborhood.\n\nThe parent rock from which it was extracted comes from the Xitle volcano, and could be obtained from San Ángel or Xochimilco. The geologist Ezequiel Ordoñez in 1893 determined such an origin and ruled it as olivine basalt. It was probably dragged by thousands of people from a maximum of 22 kilometers to the center of Mexico-Tenochtitlan.\n\nAfter the conquest, it was transferred to the exterior of the Templo Mayor, to the west of the then Palacio Virreinal and the Acequia Real, where it remained uncovered, with the relief upwards for many years. According to Durán himself, it was during the leadership of Alonso de Montúfar as archbishop when he ordered to bury the Calendar Stone so that \"the memory of the ancient sacrifice that was made there would be lost\".\n\nTowards the end of the 18th century, the viceroy Juan Vicente de Güemes initiated a series of urban reforms in the capital of New Spain. One of them was the construction of new streets and the improvement of certain areas of the city, through the introduction of drains and sidewalks. In the case of the then called Plaza Mayor, sewers were built, the floor was leveled and areas were remodeled. It was José Damián Ortiz de Castro, master of urban works executed, who reported the finding of the Piedra del Sol on December 17, 1790. The monolith was found half a yard from the ground (about 40 centimeters) and 60 meters to the west of the second door of the viceregal palace, and removed from the earth with a \"real rigging with double pulley\". Antonio de León y Gama came to the discovery site to observe and determine the origin and meaning of the monument found. According to Chavero, it was Antonio who gave it the name of Aztec Calendar, believing it to be an object of public consultation. León y Gama said the following:\n\nGama himself interceded before the canon of the Cathedral, José Uribe, in order that the monolith found would not be buried again for his alleged pagan origin, for which almost two centuries before he had been buried. Gama argued that in countries like Italy there was much that was invested in rescuing and publicly showcasing monuments of the past. It is noteworthy that, for the spirit of the time, efforts were made to exhibit the monolith in a public place and also to promote its study. Gama defended in his writings the artistic character of the stone, in competition with arguments of authors like George-Louis Buffón, who gave lesser value to those born in the American continent, including their artistic talent.\n\nThe monolith was placed on one side of the west tower of the Metropolitan Cathedral on July 2, 1791. There they observed it, among others, Alexander von Humboldt, who made several studies on his iconography. During the Mexican–American War, soldiers of the United States Army who occupied the plaza used the Piedra del Sol for target shooting.\n\nIn August 1855, the stone was transferred to the Monolith Gallery of the Archaeological Museum on Moneda Street, on the initiative of Dr. Jesús Sánchez, director of the same. Through documents from the time, it is known of the popular animosity that caused the \"confinement\" of a public reference of the city.\n\nIn 1964 the stone was transferred to the National Museum of Anthropology and History, where the stone presides over the Mexica Hall of the museum and is inscribed in various Mexican coins.\n\nBefore the discovery of the monolith of Tlaltecuhtli, deity of the earth, with measurements being 4 by 3.57 meters high, it was thought that the Calendar Stone was the largest Mexica monolith in dimensions.\n\nThe sculpted motifs that cover the surface of the stone refer to central components of the Mexica cosmogony.\n\nIn the center of the monolith is the face of the solar deity, Tonatiuh, which appears inside the glyph for \"movement\" (Nahuatl: \"Ōllin\"), the name of the current era. The central figure is shown holding a human heart in each of his clawed hands, and his tongue is represented by a stone sacrificial knife (Tecpatl).\n\nThe four squares that surround the central deity represent the four previous suns or eras, which preceded the present era, 4 Movement (Nahuatl: \"Nahui Ōllin\"). The Aztecs changed the order of the suns and introduced a fifth sun named \"4 Movement\" after they seized power over the central highlands. Each era ended with the destruction of the world and humanity, which were then recreated in the next era.\n\nThe duration of the ages is expressed in years, although they must be observed through the prism of Aztec time. In fact the common thing to figures 676, 364 and 312 is that they are multiples of 52, and 52 years is the duration of 1 Aztec century, and that is why they can express a certain amount of Aztec centuries. Thus, 676 years are 13 Aztec centuries; 364 years are 7, and 312 years are 6 Aztec centuries.\n\nPlaced among these four squares are three additional dates, 1 Flint (\"Tecpatl\"), 1 Rain (\"Atl\"), and 7 Monkey (\"Ozomahtli\"), and a Xiuhuitzolli, or ruler's turquoise diadem, glyph. It has been suggested that these dates may have had both historical and cosmic significance, and that the diadem may form part of the name of the Mexica ruler Moctezuma II.\n\nThe first concentric zone or ring contains the signs corresponding to the 20 days of the 18 months and five nemontemi of the Aztec Calendar. Beginning at the symbol just left of the large point in the previous zone, these symbols are read counterclockwise. The order is as follows: 1. cipactli - crocodile, 2. ehécatl - wind, 3. calli - house, 4. cuetzpallin - lizard, 5. cóatl - serpent, 6. miquiztli - skull/death, 7. mázatl - deer, 8. tochtli - rabbit, 9. atl - water, 10. itzcuintli - dog, 11. ozomatli - monkey, 12. malinalli - herb, 13. ácatl - cane, 14. océlotl - jaguar, 15. cuauhtli - eagle, 16. cozcacuauhtli - vulture, 17. ollín - movement, 18. técpatl - flint, 19. quiahuitl - rain, 20. xóchitl - flower \nThe second concentric zone or ring contains several square sections, with each section containing five points. Directly above these square sections are small arches are said to be feather ornaments. Directly above these are spurs or peaked arches that appear in groups of four. There are also eight angles that divide the stone into eight parts, which likely represent the sun's rays placed in the direction of the cardinal points.\n\nTwo fire serpents take up almost this entire zone. They are characterized by the flames emerging from their bodies, the square shaped segments that make up their bodies, the points that form their tails, and their unusual heads/mouths. At the very bottom of the surface of the stone, are human heads emerging from the serpent's mouths. Scholars have tried to identify these profiles of human heads as deities but have not come to a consensus. \n\nIn the upper part of this zone, a square carved between the tails of the snakes represents the date \"Matlactli Omey-Ácatl\" (\"13-reed\"). This is said to correspond to 1479, the year in which the Fifth Sun emerged in Teotihuacan during the reign of Axayácatl, and at the same time, the year in which this monolith was carved.\n\nThe edge of the stone measures approximately 8 inches and contains a band of a series of dots as well as what have been said to be flint knives. This area has been interpreted as representing a starry night sky.\n\nFrom the moment the Sun Stone was discovered in 1790, many scholars have worked at making sense of the stone's complexity. This provides a long history of over 200 years of archaeologists, scholars, and historians adding to the interpretation of the stone. Modern research continues to shed light or cast doubt on existing interpretations as discoveries such as further evidence of the stone's pigmentation. As Eduardo Matos Montezuma stated in 2004:\n\nThe earliest interpretations of the stone relate to what early scholars believed was its use for astrology, chronology, or as a sundial. In 1792, two years after the stone's unearthing, Mexican scholar Antonio de León y Gama wrote one of the first treatises on Mexican archaeology on the Aztec calendar and Coatlicue. He correctly identified that some of the glyphs on the stone are the glyphs for the days of the month. Alexander von Humboldt also wanted to pass on his interpretation in 1803, after reading Leon y Gama's work. He disagreed about the material of the stone but generally agreed with Leon y Gama's interpretation. Both of these men incorrectly believed the stone to have been vertically positioned, but it was not until 1875 that Alfredo Chavero correctly wrote that the proper position for the stone was horizontal. Roberto Sieck Flandes in 1939 published a monumental study entitled \"How Was the Stone Known as the Aztec Calendar Painted?\" which gave evidence that the stone was indeed pigmented with bright blue, red, green, and yellow colors, just as many other Aztec sculptures have been found to have been as well\".\" This work was later to be expanded by Felipe Solís and other scholars who would re-examine the idea of coloring and create updated digitized images for a better understanding of what the stone might have looked like. It was generally established that the four symbols included in the Ollin glyph represent the four past suns that the Mexica believed the earth had passed through.\n\nAnother aspect of the stone is its religious significance. One theory is that the face at the center of the stone represents Tonatiuh, the Aztec deity of the sun. It is for this reason that the stone became known as the \"Sun Stone.\" Richard Townsend proposed a different theory, claiming that the figure at the center of the stone represents Tlaltecuhtli, the Mexica earth deity who features in Mexica creation myths. Modern archaeologists, such as those at the National Anthropology Museum in Mexico City, believe it is more likely to have been used primarily as a ceremonial basin or ritual altar for gladiatorial sacrifices, than as an astrological or astronomical reference.\n\nYet another characteristic of the stone is its possible geographic significance. The four points may relate to the four corners of the earth or the cardinal points. The inner circles may express space as well as time.\n\nLastly, there is the political aspect of the stone. It may have been intended to show Tenochtitlan as the center of the world and therefore, as the center of authority. Townsend argues for this idea, claiming that the small glyphs of additional dates amongst the four previous suns—1 Flint (\"Tecpatl\"), 1 Rain (\"Atl\"), and 7 Monkey (\"Ozomahtli\")—represent matters of historical importance to the Mexica state. He posits, for example, that 7 Monkey represents the significant day for the cult of a community within Tenochtitlan. His claim is further supported by the presence of Mexica ruler Moctezuma II's name on the work. These elements ground the Stone's iconography in history rather than myth and the legitimacy of the state in the cosmos.\n\nThe calendar stone image is displayed on the obverse the Mexican 20 Peso gold coin, which has a gold content of and was minted from 1917-1921 and restruck with the date 1959 from the mid 1940s to the late 1970s. Different parts of the calendar are represented on the current Mexican coins, each denomination has a different section.\n\nThe calendar stone image also has been adopted by modern Mexican and Mexican American/Chicano culture figures, and is used in folk art and as a symbol of cultural identity.\n\nThere are several other known monuments and sculptures that bear similar inscriptions. Most of them were found underneath the center of Mexico City, while others are of unknown origin. Many fall under a category known as temalacatl, large stones built for ritual combat and sacrifice. Matos Moctezuma has proposed that the Aztec Calendar Stone might also be one of these.\n\nThe Stone of Tizoc's upward-facing side contains a calendrical depiction similar to that of the subject of this page. Many of the formal elements are the same, although the five glyphs at the corners and center are not present. The tips of the compass here extend to the edge of the sculpture. The Stone of Tizoc is currently located in the National Anthropology Museum in the same gallery as the Aztec Calendar Stone.\n\nThe Stone of Motecuhzoma I is a massive object approximately 12 feet in diameter and 3 feet high with the 8 pointed compass iconography. The center depicts the sun deity Tonatiuh with the tongue sticking out.\n\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art has another, viewable here. This one is much smaller, but still bears the calendar iconography and is listed in their catalog as \"Calendar Stone\". The side surface is split into two bands, the lower of which represents Venus with knives for eyes; the upper band has two rows of \"citlallo\" star icons.\n\nA similar object is on display at the Yale University Art Gallery, on loan from the Peabody Museum of Natural History. This object can be viewed here. The sculpture, officially known as Aztec Calendar Stone in the museum catalog but called \"Altar of the Five Cosmogonic Eras\", bears similar hieroglyphic inscriptions around the central compass motif but is distinct in that it is a rectangular prism instead of cylindrical shape, allowing the artists to add the symbols of the four previous suns at the corners. It bears some similarities to the Coronation Stone of Moctezuma II, listed in the next section.\n\nThe \"Coronation Stone of Motecuhzoma II\" (also known as the \"Stone of the Five Suns\") is a sculpture measuring 55.9 x 66 x 22.9 cm (22 x 26 x 9 in), currently in the possession of the Art Institute of Chicago. It bears similar hieroglyphic inscriptions to the Aztec Calendar Stone, with 4-Movement at the center surrounded by 4-Jaguar, 4-Wind, 4-Rain, and 4-Water, all of which represent one of the five suns, or \"cosmic eras\". The year sign 11-Reed in the lower middle places the creation of this sculpture in 1503, the year of Motecuhzoma II's coronation, while 1-Crocodile, the day in the upper middle, may indicate the day of the ceremony. The date glyph 1-Rabbit on the back of the sculpture (not visible in the image to the right) orients Motecuhzoma II in the cosmic cycle because that date represents \"the beginning of things in the distant mythological past.\"\n\nThe \"Throne of Montezuma\" uses the same cardinal point iconography as part of a larger whole. The monument is on display at the National Museum of Anthropology alongside the Aztec Calendar Stone and the Stone of Tizoc. The monument was discovered in 1831 underneath the National Palace in Mexico City and is approximately 1 meter square at the base and 1.23 meters tall. It is carved in a temple shape, and the year at the top, 2-House, refers to the traditional founding of Tenochtitlan in 1345 CE.\n\nThe compass motif with \"Ollin\" can be found in stone alters built for the New Fire ceremony. Another object, the Ceremonial Seat of Fire which belongs to the Eusebio Davalos Hurtado Museum of Mexica Sculpture, is visually similar but omits the central \"Ollin\" image in favor of the Sun.\n\nThe British Museum possesses a cuauhxicalli which may depict the tension between two opposites, the power of the sun (represented by the solar face) and the power of the moon (represented with lunar iconography on the rear of the object). This would be a parallel to the Templo Mayor with its depictions of Huitzilopochtli (as one of the two deities of the temple) and the large monument to Coyolxauhqui.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25151891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25151891", "title": "Comics studies", "text": "Comics studies\n\nComics studies (also comic(s) art studies, sequential art studies or graphic narrative studies) is an academic field that focuses on comics and sequential art. Although comics and graphic novels have been generally dismissed as less relevant pop culture texts, scholars in fields such as semiotics, composition studies and cultural studies are now re-considering comics and graphic novels as complex texts deserving of serious scholarly study.\n\nNot to be confused with the technical aspects of comics creation, comics studies exists only with the creation of comics theory—which approaches comics critically as an art—and the writing of comics historiography (the study of the history of comics). Comics theory has significant overlap with the philosophy of comics, i.e., the study of the ontology, epistemology and aesthetics of comics, the relationship between comics and other art forms, and the relationship between text and image in comics.\n\nComics studies is also interrelated with comics criticism, the analysis and evaluation of comics and the comics medium.\n\nAlthough there has been the occasional investigation of comics as a valid art form, specifically in Gilbert Seldes' \"The 7 Lively Arts\" (1924), Martin Sheridan's \"Classic Comics and Their Creators\" (1942), and David Kunzle's \"The Early Comic Strip: Narrative Strips and Picture Stories in the European Broadsheet from c. 1450 to 1825\" (1973), contemporary Anglophone comics studies in North America can be said to have burst onto the academic scene with both Will Eisner's \"Comics and Sequential Art\" in 1985 and Scott McCloud's \"Understanding Comics\" in 1993. Continental comics studies can trace its roots back to the work of semioticians such as Roland Barthes (particularly his 1964 essay \"Rhetoric of the Image\", published in English in the anthology \"Image—Music—Text\") and Umberto Eco (particularly his 1964 book \"Apocalittici e integrati\").\n\nMore recently, analysis of comics have begun to be undertaken by cognitive scientists, the most prominent being Neil Cohn, who has used tools from linguistics to detail the theoretical structure of comics' underlying \"visual language\", and has also used psychological experimentation from cognitive neuroscience to test these theories in actual comprehension. This work has suggested similarities between the way that the brain processes language and the way it processes sequential images. Cohn's theories are not universally accepted with other scholars like Thierry Groensteen, Hannah Miodrag, and Barbara Postema offering alternative understandings.\n\nSimilar to the problems of defining literature and film, no consensus has been reached on a definition of the comics medium, and attempted definitions and descriptions have fallen prey to numerous exceptions. Theorists such as Töpffer, R. C. Harvey, Will Eisner, David Carrier, Alain Rey, and Lawrence Grove emphasize the combination of text and images, though there are prominent examples of pantomime comics throughout its history. Other critics, such as Thierry Groensteen and Scott McCloud, have emphasized the primacy of sequences of images. Towards the close of the 20th century, different cultures' discoveries of each other's comics traditions, the rediscovery of forgotten early comics forms, and the rise of new forms made defining comics a more complicated task.\n\nIn the field of composition studies, an interest in comics and graphic novels is growing, partially due to the work of comics theorists but also due to composition studies' growing focus on multimodality and visual rhetoric. Composition studies theorists are looking at comics as sophisticated texts, and sites of complex literacy.\n\nGunther Kress defines multimodality as \"the use of several semiotic modes in the design of a semiotic product or event, together with the particular way in which these mode are combined\" or, more simply as \"any text whose meanings are realized through more than one semiotic code\".\n\nKristie S. Fleckenstein sees the relationship between image and text as \"mutually constitutive, mutually infused\"—a relationship she names \"imageword\". Fleckenstein sees \"imageword\" as offering \"a double vision of writing-reading based on [the] fusion of image and word, a double vision of literacy\".\n\nDale Jacobs sees the reading of comics as a form of \"multimodal literacy or multiliteracy, rather than as a debased form of print literacy\". According to Jacobs, comics can help educators to move \"toward attending to multimodal literacies\" that \"shift our focus from print only to multiple modalities\". He encourages educators to embrace a pedagogy that will give students skills to effectively negotiate these multiple modalities.\n\nComics historiography (the study of the history of comics) studies the historical process through which comics became an autonomous art medium and an integral part of culture. An area of study is premodern sequential art; some scholars such as Scott McCloud consider Egyptian hieroglyphics and paintings and pre-Columbian American picture manuscripts to be the very first form of comics and sequential art. Another area of study is the 20th-century emergence of the subculture of comics readers and comicphilia (the passionate interest in comic books).\n\nComics studies is becoming increasingly more common at academic institutions across the world. Some notable examples include: University of Florida, University of Toronto at Mississauga, and University of California Santa Cruz, among others. West Liberty University is currently the only university offering a four-year undergraduate literature degree in comics studies. In Britain, growing interest in comics has led to the establishment of a center for comics studies, the Scottish Centre for Comics Studies (SCCS) at the University of Dundee in Scotland. Beside formal programs and degrees, it is common to see individual courses dedicated to comics and graphic novels in many educational institutions.\n\nSol M. Davidson's New York University thesis, \"Culture and the Comic Strips\", earned him the first PhD in comics in 1959, while in France, Jean-Christophe Menu was awarded a Doctorate in Art and Art Sciences in 2011 from Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne after defending his thesis \"The Comics and its Double: Language and Frontiers of Comics: Practical, Theoretical and Editorial Prospects\".\n\nTeesside University began offering a BA in Comics and Graphic Novels in 2014, as well as an MA in Comics from 2018. They have since appointed a team of renowned comics practitioners including Fionnuala Doran, Julian Lawrence, Con Chrisoulis, Nigel Kitching and Tara McInerney.\n\nThe University of Lancaster started offering a PhD degree in comics studies in 2015. The same year French comics studies scholar Benoît Peeters (a student of Roland Barthes) was appointed as the UK's first ever comics professor at Lancaster University.\n\nSince 2000 many new scholarly journals have appeared dedicated to comics studies. Three of the most important peer refereed journals in English are: \"Journal of Graphic Novels and Comics\", \"Studies in Comics\", and \"European Comic Art\". Other notable journals include: \"ImageTexT\" (a peer reviewed, open access journal that began in the spring of 2004 and is based at the University of Florida), \"Image and Narrative\" (stylized as \"Image [&] Narrative\", a peer-reviewed e-journal on visual narratology), \"SANE: Sequential Art Narrative in Education\" (based at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln), \"Inks: The Journal of the Comics Studies Society\" (published by the Ohio State University Press), \"The Comics Grid: Journal of Comics Scholarship\", and the \"International Journal of Comic Art\".\n\nAlthough presentations dedicated to comics are commonplace at conferences in many fields, entire conferences dedicated to this subject are becoming more common. There have been conferences at SAIC (International Comic Arts Forum), MMU (The International Bande Dessinée Society Conference), UTS (Sequential Art Studies Conference), Georgetown, Ohio State (Festival of Cartoon Art), and Bowling Green (Comics in Popular Culture conference), and there is a yearly conference at University of Florida (Conference on Comics and Graphic Novels). Additionally, there is an annual Michigan State University Comics Forum, which brings together academics and professionals working in the industry. Notable regularly held movable conferences include the Comic Art and Comics Area of the Popular Culture Association of America and the conference of the International Society for Humor Studies.\n\nThe International Comics Arts Forum (ICAF), begun in 1995 at Georgetown University by Guy Spielmann and Tristan Fonlladosa, is an annual academic conference distinguished by its international focus and scholarly rigor The German \"Gesellschaft für Comicforschung\" (ComFor, Society for Comics Studies) has organized yearly academic conferences since 2006. The Comics Arts Conference has met regularly since 1992 in conjunction with San Diego Comic-Con International and WonderCon. Another important conference is the annual International Graphic Novels and Comics Conference held since 2010 organized by British academics. This conference has been held in conjunction with the longer running International Bande Dessinée Society conference. \"Comics Forum\", a UK-based community of international comics scholars, also holds an annual conference at Leeds Central Library; the first was held in 2009.\n\n\n\n"}

The nymphs scream in surprise and attempt to cover Diana, who, in a fit of embarrassed fury, splashes water upon Actaeon. He is transformed into a deer with a dappled hide and long antlers, robbed of his ability to speak, and thereafter promptly flees in fear. It is not long, however, before his own hounds track him down and kill him, failing to recognize their master.\n\nThe story became very popular in the Renaissance. The most common scene shown was Actaeon surprising Diana, but his transformation and his death were also sometimes shown. Titian painted the first two scenes in two of his greatest late \"poesies\" for Philip II of Spain, in \"Diana and Actaeon\" and \"The Death of Actaeon\". The latter actually shows the transformation still in progress; like many depictions the head is shown transformed, but most of the body remains human. Less often Actaeon is fully transformed when caught by his dogs. The story was popular on Italian Renaissance maiolica.\n\nThe origins of the \"Diana and Actaeon Pas de Deux,\" a \"divertissement\" created for a 1935 version of \"La Esmeralda,\" lie in two earlier ballet productions. The first of these was \"Tsar Kandavl\" (aka \"Le Roi Candaule\"), premiered in 1868 by the Imperial Russian Ballet in Saint Petersburg. Based on a story told by Herodotus in his \"Histories,\" this four-act ballet, choreographed by Marius Petipa to music by Cesare Pugni, included a \"pas de trois\" for dancers portraying Diana, the Roman goddess of the moon, the hunt, and chastity; Endymion, a beautiful shepherd, and a Satyr. This \"divertissement\" told of a poetic encounter in which Diana (or Selene, another name for the moon goddess) looked down upon the sleeping youth, descended to earth, kissed him, and fell in love. In a production mounted in the early twentieth century, Anna Pavlova was among those who danced Diana, and Vaslav Nijinsky appeared as the Satyr. In 1917, George Balanchine, then Balanchivadze, also danced the role of the Satyr, with Lydia Ivanova as Diana and Nicholas Efimov as Endymion.\n\nIn 1886, Petipa incorporated a new \"pas de deux,\" set to music by Riccardo Drigo, into his production of Pugni's \"La Esmeralda\" for the Maryinsky Ballet, as the Imperial Russian Ballet had come to be called. This \"pas de deux\" was based on the Greek myth of Artemis (predecessor to the Roman Diana), in her aspect of virgin goddess of the hunt, and Actaeon, a Theban hero. According to Ovid's \"Metamorphoses,\" Actaeon, out on a hunt, stumbled upon Artemis while she was bathing at a spring. Outraged and embarrassed that he had seen her naked, she punished him by destroying his power of speech and turning him into a stag, with antlers and a shaggy coat. In deer form, he was torn to pieces by his own hunting dogs, whipped into a raging fury by Artemis.\n\nIn 1935, Agrippina Vaganova staged a new production of \"La Esmeralda\" for the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad, as the company and the city were then known. She created a new, bravura \"pas de deux\" for Diana and Actaeon, joining the names of the modest Roman goddess and the hapless Greek hunter. She included a few spectacular \"stag leaps\" for the male dancer, but she largely abandoned the well-known story of Actaeon in creating this \"divertissement\" and made instead a rapturous dance for two lovers, set to music by Pugni. Diana is seen as the beautiful goddess of the moon and the hunt, usually wearing a wispy red chiton and carrying a small golden bow; Actaeon is portrayed as a strong, handsome, mortal youth, clad in a short chiton or loincloth. At the premiere, Diana was danced by Galina Ulanova and Actaeon by Vaktang Chabukiani. Vaganova's popular \"pas de deux,\" which might have been better called \"Diana and Endymion,\" is still performed today as a spectacular showpiece for a ballerina and her partner.\n\n"}

{"id": "1978984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1978984", "title": "Discourse community", "text": "Discourse community\n\nA discourse community is a group of people who share a set of discourses, understood as basic values and assumptions, and ways of communicating about those goals. Linguist John Swales defined discourse communities as \"groups that have goals or purposes, and use communication to achieve these goals\".\n\nSome examples of a discourse community might be those who read and/or contribute to a particular academic journal, or members of an email list for Madonna fans. Each discourse community has its own unwritten rules about what can be said and how it can be said: for instance, the journal will not accept an article with the claim that \"Discourse is the coolest concept\"; on the other hand, members of the email list may or may not appreciate a Freudian analysis of Madonna's latest single. Most people move within and between different discourse communities every day.\n\nSince the discourse community itself is intangible, it is easier to imagine discourse communities in terms of the fora in which they operate. The hypothetical journal and email list can each be seen as an example of a forum, or a \"concrete, local manifestation of the operation of the discourse community\".\n\nThe term was first used by sociolinguist Martin Nystrand in 1982, and further developed by American linguist John Swales. Writing about the acquisition of academic writing styles of those who are learning English as an additional language, Swales presents six defining characteristics:\n\nJames Porter defined the discourse community as: \"a local and temporary constraining system, defined by a body of texts (or more generally, practices) that are unified by a common focus. A discourse community is a textual system with stated and unstated conventions, a vital history, mechanisms for wielding power, institutional hierarchies, vested interests, and so on.\"\n\nArgumentation theorists Chaim Perelman and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyceta offer the following statement on the conditioned nature of all discourse, which has applicability to the concept of discourse community: \"All language is the language of community, be this a community bound by biological ties, or by the practice of a common discipline or technique. The terms used, their meaning, their definition, can only be understood in the context of the habits, ways of thought, methods, external circumstances, and tradition known to the users of those terms. A deviation from usage requires justification ...\"\n\n\"Producing text within a discourse community,\" according to Patricia Bizzell, \"cannot take place unless the writer can define her goals in terms of the community's interpretive conventions.\" In other words, one cannot simply produce any text—it must fit the standards of the discourse community to which it is appealing. If one wants to become a member of a certain discourse community, it requires more than learning the lingo. It requires understanding concepts and expectations set up within that community.\n\nThe language used by discourse communities can be described as a register or diatype, and members generally join a discourse community through training or personal persuasion. This is in contrast to the speech community (or the 'native discourse community', to use Bizzell's term), who speak a language or dialect inherited by birth or adoption.\n\nOne tool that is commonly used for designing a discourse community is a map. \nThe map could provide the common goals, values, specialized vocabulary and specialized genre of the discourse community. This tool may be presented to all members as a mission statement. As a new generation of members enter into a discourse community, new interests may appear. What was originally mapped out may be recreated to accommodate any updated interests. The way in which a discourse community is designed, ultimately controls the way in which the community functions. A discourse community differs from any other type of grouping because the design will either constrain or enable participants.\n\nA discourse community can be viewed as a social network, built from participants who share some set of communicative purposes. In the digital age, social networks can be examined as their own branches of discourse communities. A genesis of online discourse is created through four phases: orientation, experimentation, productivity, and transformation. Just as the digital world is constantly evolving, \"discourse communities continually define and redefine themselves through communications among members\", according to Berkenkotter. A community of practice requires a group of people negotiating work and working toward a common goal using shared or common resources. These virtual discourse communities consist of a group of people brought together \"by natural will and a set of shared ideas and ideals\". The virtual discourse communities become a separate entity from any other discourse community when, \"enough people carry on those public relationships long enough to form webs of personal relationships in cyberspace\".\n\n\"The term discourse community has been criticized in being imprecise and inaccurate, by emphasizing the uniformity, symmetrical relations and cooperation within text circulation networks.\" Social collectivities within a discourse community can be interpreted as controversial whether by design or mistake. Members of the discourse community take on either assigned or maintained roles which serve as discursive authority, rights, expectations and constraints. Within an online discourse community text oftentimes circulate in what can be considered to be heterogeneous groupings, as teachers write to audiences of administrators, scholars, colleagues, parents and students. The circulation of texts form groups of communities that might not otherwise existed prior to being untied by the circulation of documents. \"These and other social complexities suggest a more subtle and varied sociological vocabulary is needed to describe the set of relations within text circulation networks as well as to describe the ways genres mediate the actions and relations within these social collectivities, such as that provided by sociocultural theories of genre and activity.\"\n\nDiscourse communities are not limited to involvement of people from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds. These people begin to adapt to standards of that discourse community. However, involvement in one discourse community does not hinder participation in other groups based on a pursuit of a common goal. In some cases, under specific standards, traces of discourse interference may appear from other standards.\n\nYerrick and Gilbert discuss the impact of discourse perpetuates marginalization of underrepresented students. Their study discuss their frustration of the overwhelming number of school policies and practices creating obstacles for certain students voices to be heard.\nTherefore, minimizing lower-track students' input shaping mainstream academic curriculum. These students are given few opportunities to contribute in the classroom and when they did, they would only be permitted to echo someone else's voice on particular views and opinions. With resentment, Yerrick and Gilbert state \"There was no attempt to match the home-based discourse with the academic discourse promoted in the classroom, as has been proven problematic through other studies as well.\"\n\nDiscourse communities are studied in the larger field of genre analysis. Related terms include Miller's \"rhetorical community\" and, focusing on the communication rather than the community, Yates & Orlikowski's \"genres of organizational communication\"\n\nJames Paul Gee uses discourse as a way of \"(writing)-doing-being-valuing-believing combinations\" (Gee 142). Discourse can be connected to the concept of audience in that both the audience and the writer partake in a series of historical contingencies that place the writer and audience into a larger conversation with one another. It is an \"identity kit\" of sorts: \"A Discourse is a sort of 'identity kit' which comes complete with the appropriate costume and instructions on how to act, talk, and often write, so as to take on a particular social role that others will recognize. Imagine what an identity kit to play the role of Sherlock Holmes would involve: certain clothes, certain ways of using language (oral language and print), certain attitudes and beliefs, allegiance to a certain life style, and certain ways of interacting with others. We can call all these factors together, as they are integrated around the identity of 'Sherlock Holmes, Master Detective' the 'Sherlock Holmes Discourse'. This example also makes clear that 'Discourse', as I am using the term, does not involve just talk or just language. (Gee 142) Furthermore, discourses are not individualistic, but rather community-based, in official (institutional frameworks) capacities, unofficial (social groups) capacities, or both. Specifically, \"Discourses are always embedded in a medley of social institutions, and often involve various 'props' like books and magazines of various sorts, laboratories, classrooms, buildings of various sorts, various technologies, and a myriad of other objects from sewing needles (for sewing circles) through birds (for bird watchers) to basketball courts and basketballs (for basketball players)\" (143).\n\nRegarding contemporary rhetorical communities, Zappen, et al., states, \"Thus a contemporary rhetorical community is less a collection of people joined by shared beliefs and values than a public space or forum that permits these people to engage each other and form limited or local communities of belief.\" Incorporating this factor suggests an introduction to a democratic system in discourse communities and has also been educationally termed \"Accountable Talk\" by researchers, indicating the diversity of communities.\n\n"}

The title is taken from films which bookend the era: \"Easy Rider\" (1969) and \"Raging Bull\" (1980). The book follows Hollywood on the brink of the Vietnam War, when a group of young Hollywood film directors known as the \"movie brats\" are making their names. It begins in the 1960s and ends in the 1980s.\n\nThe book was the basis of a 2003 documentary film of the same name directed by Kenneth Bowser and narrated by actor William H. Macy. It was screened out of competition at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 100% based on reviews from 8 critics.\n\n\nSeveral of the film-makers profiled in the book have criticized Biskind. Robert Altman denounced both the book and Biskind's methods, saying \"It was hate mail. We were all lured into talking to this guy because people thought he was a straight guy but he was filling a commission from the publisher for a hatchet job. He's the worst kind of human being I know.\" Francis Ford Coppola was similarly critical, alleging that Biskind interviewed only people with negative opinions of him.\n\nCritic Roger Ebert noted that Steven Spielberg said of \"Easy Riders, Raging Bulls\" that: \"Every single word in that book about me is either erroneous or a lie.\" Ebert himself notes that: \"Biskind has a way of massaging his stories to suit his agenda.\" When asked about Biskind's portrayal of him as \"a womanizer, a tyrant and a bully,\" William Friedkin said: \"I've actually never read the book, but I've talked to some of my friends who are portrayed in it, and we all share the opinion that it is partial truth, partial myth and partial out-and-out lies by mostly rejected girlfriends and wives.\" Peter Bogdanovich was equally furious, saying: \"I spent seven hours with that guy over a period of days, and he got it all wrong\".\n\n\"A Decade Under the Influence\"-a 2003 documentary also about New Hollywood\n\n"}
{"id": "41811383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41811383", "title": "Ecovention", "text": "Ecovention\n\nEcovention was a term invented by Amy Lipton and Sue Spaid in 1999 to refer to an ecological art intervention in environmental degradation. The Ecovention movement in art is associated with land art, earthworks, and environmental art, and landscape architecture, but remains its own distinct category. Many ecoventions bear tendencies similar to public works projects such as sewage and waste-water treatment plants, public gardens, landfills, mines, and sustainable building projects.\n\nThe term ‘Ecovention’ appears by the composition of the terms 'ecology' and 'innovation' or 'intervention'. The intention was to concrete a kind of art that alludes to the interventions that artists were made in degraded natural territories, pretending to generate a public consciousness, showing the existence of solutions. The fact of restoring make the artists enter in a collaboration process with the nature in a social way. They help to generate a new paradigm teaching how art could help the society not only in a social or political criticism, but getting directly involved in the world. They are responsible for extending the various environmental principles and practices to the community. \n\nArtists will focus on various aspects like: biological, cultural, political or historical. At the same time, different professionals work that are fundamental; architects, botanists, zoologists, engineers, ecologists... all based on the imaginative idea of an artist 4.\nActivism, the re-evaluation of territories, the study of diversity and the recovery of spaces will be some of its main characteristics. To carry them out, they use new techniques in order to transform that local ecology in order to reestablish natural resources and stabilize environments. His works have as a common goal to motivate the viewer to visit these spaces generating awareness and in turn encourage more interventions. \nArtists associated with ecovention include: Joseph Beuys, Mel Chin, Agnes Denes, Helen and Newton Harrison, Ocean Earth, Robert Smithson, Alan Sonfist, and Mierle Laderman Ukeles, among others.\n\n\"Ecovention\" is also the title of a 2002 exhibition at the \"Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center\" in Ohio, and the title of exhibition catalog, joint published with the Greenmuseum. It was considered the definitive text on ecological art for several years and the only text available for teaching the topic at the college and University level.\n\nOther major exhibitions apart from the CAC's \"Ecovention\" exhibition include: \"Earth Art\" (1969) at Cornell University, \"Elements of Art: Earth, Air and Fire\" (1971) at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, \"Earthworks: Land Reclamation as Sculpture\" (1979) at the Seattle Art Museum, and \"Fragile Ecologies\" (1992) curated by Barbara Matilsky at the Queens Museum of Art.\n\nThere is a new exhibition, Ecovention Europe, planned to open in the Fall of 2017.

{"id": "707370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=707370", "title": "El Perú (Maya site)", "text": "El Perú (Maya site)\n\nEl Perú (also known as Waka' ), is a pre-Columbian Maya archeological site occupied during the Preclassic and Classic cultural chronology periods (roughly 500 BC to 800 AD). The site was the capital of a Maya city-state and is located near the banks of the San Pedro River in the Department of Petén of northern Guatemala. El Perú is west of Tikal.\n\nThe Maya city of Waka' was rediscovered by oil prospectors in the 1960s. In the 1970s Ian Graham, a Harvard researcher, documented monuments at the site. Then in 2003 David Freidel, of Southern Methodist University, and Héctor Escobedo, of the University of San Carlos, began to excavate Waka'.\n\nThe site was named \"El Perú\" when rediscovered in the twentieth century. Hieroglyphs identified and deciphered at the site have indicated that the ancient name for the site was \"Waka'.\" While both names are currently used interchangeably, El Perú predominates on extant maps. In the published literature, a conflated name is generally used, El Perú-\"Waka'.\"\n\nThe first recorded meeting between Teotihuacan and the Maya occurred at Waka' in 378, 10 days prior to their arrival at Tikal. This moment is known among Mesoamerican archaeologists as “La Entrada.” During the early phases of the Early Classic, Waka’ was allied with Tikal.\n\nWaka’, however, later betrayed Tikal and forged an alliance with Calakmul. This alliance was solidified by K'inich Balam (“Sun Faced Jaguar”), who ruled from the late 7th century to the early 8th century and was married to Lady T'abi, a royal princess from Calakmul, capital of the Kan dynasty at the time. This union was a political maneuver that linked El Peru (K’inich Balam) to Calakmul and its leader Yuknom Cheen in a military alliance. Lady T’abi was later given the title \"ix kaloomté\" (\"empress\" or \"warlord”), a high title used in ancient Maya texts. Yuknom Cheen was attempting to gather several Maya kingdoms into a larger polity\n\nWaka’s downfall was likely initiated by its alliance with Calakmul. Following Tikal’s re-emergence from its hiatus in the Late Classic, Calakmul fell to its military might. Calakmul’s ruler Yik'in Chan K'awiil, likely the brother of Lady T'abi, was defeated, captured, and sacrificed in Tikal’s central plaza in 732. Waka’ was converted into a vassal state of Tikal. Yik'in Chan K'awiil defeated Waka' in 743. After his victory he took an image of a celestial serpent from Waka' and brought it to Tikal. According to Robert Sharer the celestial serpent was possibly Waka's patron deity. Evidence for Yik'in Chan K'awiil's act can be found on Tikal's Temple IV. Not a year later he defeated Naranjo. Waka' was eventually destroyed a decade later, an event that included the capture and sacrifice of K'inich Balam's successor.\n\nAs a trading power, Waka' held proximity to the San Pedro River which flowed westward from the Petén. Waka also had access to a north-south overland route. This route connected south Campeche and the Petén. The close location to the dominant Maya capitals Calakmul and Tikal contributed to the trading power of Waka'. Waka's market included maize, beans, chili peppers, avocados, chicle, and latex. Waka', also, obtained jade and quetzal feathers, used for costumes.\n\nAround 400, Waka' had a population containing tens of thousands people. According to Chris Hardman in \"Woman Power in the Maya World,\" this was the political peak of the city. The reason for the high population was the ideal location and trading power of the city.\n\nThe city included hundreds of buildings, four plazas, and ceremonial centers.\nArchaeologists have divided El Perú into different groups and plazas. Plaza 1 is in the center of the site. Other plazas, built neighboring Plaza 1, include residence compounds. The Northwest group is located near Plaza 1 and a ballcourt. The Paal group can be found near Plaza 2 and south of Plaza 1. South east of Plaza 1 are the Chok and Tolok groups. Just below these groups is the Mirador Complex.\n\nA number of tombs have recently been discovered at Waka' that contribute to the understanding of past Maya culture. One that is particularly important is the “Queen’s Tomb.” This feature contains the remains of a female in a tomb containing a rich assortment of grave goods. Of particular importance is the presence of a bloodletting paraphernalia in the form of a ceremonial stingray spine. This object was in clear association with the individual’s genital region, and indicates that royal women practiced genitalia bloodletting rituals.\n\nAn additional tomb for an elite individual was recently found within an 18 meter tall pyramid located in the site’s central core. The tomb’s chamber, which is 5.1 meters long by 1.5 meters wide, contained a rich assemblage of grave goods, including jade offerings, shell artifacts, ceramic vessels, 12 ballgame player figurines, the paws of jaguar, and stones from the Eastern Highlands and the Pacific Lowlands, which were used as signs of wealth. The early date of the tomb, between c. 200 and 400, indicates Waka’s early regional importance in the southern Maya lowlands.\n\nRecent research at the site of Zapote Bobal suggests a strong connection between that site and El Perú. It is possible that El Perú may have had a strong influence on the dynasty centered at Zapote Bobal.\n\nThe Early Classic period emblem glyph of El Perú consists of an Ajaw glyph connected to a zoomorphic head. According to Stanley Paul Guenter, this is similar to the Chapa(h)t logogram. Guenter also believes the zoomorphic head represents a centipede or creature with a face like a centipede's. The main sign of this glyph says \"Wak\". Guenter says this could be a word used for centipede however there is little evidence for this in previous knowledge of Mayan.\n\nThe Late classic shows a transition from iconographic logogram usage for the emblem glyph to use of syllables to spell out the name.\n\nThe \"Snake Head Emblem\" was originally thought to represent El Perú. This idea came from a pair of looted stelea Ian Graham said came from the site. Scholars David Stuart, Stephen Houston, and others have found a different emblem glyph they believe provides a better representation of El Perú during the Late Classic.\n\nSimon Martin was the first to study this glyph in 2000. The emblem includes two hieroglyphs. The first glyph contains three different signs. The K'uh sign is a prefix for the glyph and according to Stanley Paul Guenter of Southern Methodist University the sign is used to represent something \"divine.\" A male head with a spot on his cheek makes up the second part of the hieroglyph. Guenter says this is most likely a representation of the maize god. Above the head's ear is a K'in sign. On top of the male head is a sign David Stuart, and Stephen Houston read as Nal. Guenter says the sign requires further study before it can be legitimately read as Nal.\n\nThe second hieroglyph also contains three signs. The glyph includes an Ajaw, a leadership title, superfix. Below this sign is the syllable \"ka\". The syllable \"wa\" makes the third sign. Simon Martin says this glyph should be read as \"Wak Ajaw\". He has identified \" Waka' \" as the ancient toponym for El Perú. In Stanley Paul Guenter's article, \"Emblem Glyph of El Perú\" he says \"-a' \" refers to the Maya word used for water. Therefore, Waka' means \"Wak-water\" or \"Wak-place.\" The possible meanings for \"wak\" include the number six or the description of a location on an escarpment. The latter possibility comes from \"wa\"' meaning \"stood up.\"\n\nKings in the Late Classic differed from Early Classic because they attached a second part to the emblem. This second part recognized new rulers and an alliance with Calakmul.\n\nStela 15 is a monument containing only Maya glyphs. Keith Eppich dates the stela to 416. The monument contains the names of rulers back until the mid 4th century. The monument also describes how a foreign war leader Siyaj K'ahk, or Siyaj K'ak' came to Waka' during January of 378. According to epigrapher David Stuart (Mayanist), this stela supports the idea of Siyaj K'ahk' traveling through Waka' roughly eight days before taking over Tikal's government.\n\nStela 16 was first sketched by Ian Graham in the early 1970s and later in 2004 by David Freidel.\n\nThe monument, found a few yards away from Stela 15, shows a man wearing a headdress and royal outfit similar to rulers of Teotihuacan. The man holds a bird-headed staph on his right and a bundle on his left. David Freidel suggests the bird head is a symbol for \"Spearthrower Owl.\" This was one name used for a certain king of Teotihuacan, and the father of Siyaj K'ahk'. Epigrapher Stanley Guenter deciphered part of the Maya script on Stela 16 and believes it says \"planted [his] banner stone, Siyaj K'ahk\". Freidel thinks this monument is a depiction of the war leader many years after he had traveled through Waka'.\n\nThe text of stela 30 describes the contact of El Perú's king Mah-Kina-Balam and his wife to the king Jaguar-Paw, of Calakmul. The stela says they participated, along with other kings from western kingdoms, in the ritual of accession for Jaguar-Paw. One of these kings may have included Flint-Sky-God K of Dos Pilas, well known for his many captives. The stela describes how Mah-Kina-Balam and his wife were a part of the period-ending rites and displayed the God K scepter to Jaguar-Paw. Stela 30 also gives proof of Jaguar-Paw's visits to El Perú.\n\nThis stela portrays a woman identified as Lady K'abel who is described as a lady warlord. She was the wife of king K'inich B'ahlam II and daughter of the Calakmul king Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ak'. The stela was found by a looter in the 1960s. It is believed to be dated to 692. Stela 34 would have been situated in one of the plazas.\n\nIn 2004 tomb, dating between 650 and 750, was discovered by José Ambrosio Díaz. This tomb holds the remains of a high status woman. The tomb was identified as a royal tomb due to the amount of jade. Archaeologists believe the tomb may belong to Lady K'abel because the items within the tomb are similar to the image of her on Stela 34. The tomb was found in the main courtyard, under a building. Within the tomb were 23 vessels used for offerings, beads, shells, and a \"huunal\" jewel. This jewel was often placed on \"ko'haws\", helmets. These helmets were worn by war leaders. This suggests the woman was more powerful than most women of her time. Archaeologists do not believe this helmet necessarily means she was a war leader. It is more likely she was acting as a guardian of items used in battle.\n\nIn 2005 archaeologists Michelle Rich and Jennifer Piehl found the remains of two, possibly royal, women. The tomb is 4 feet high and 6.5 feet long. The two women were laid on top of each other with their backs touching. The woman on the bottom was pregnant. At the time of their death they were between the ages of 25 and 35. These women are believed to be royal because of their great condition of health and the vessels within their tomb. Rich believes these women were sacrificed by a new ruler who sought to eliminate the current family in power.\n\nIn 2006, Field Director Michelle Rich and her team discovered a collapsed tomb of a supposed ruler who died in the early 7th century. Burial #39 was located at pyramid O14-04 in the \"adosada,\" also known as the front platform. The tomb was sealed by a stone wall which took the archaeologists five days to remove. The artifacts within this tomb include painted and carved bones, mosaics, jade, mirrors, snake-like figurines, and ceramic figurines. The value of the items within this burial suggest the individual was a king. The king ruled after Muwaan Bahlam and before K'inich Bahlam II.\n\nWithin Burial #39 a group of 23 figurines were found. In David Freidel's article, \"Resurrecting the Maize King,\" he discusses how these figurines are a depiction of a royal court performing a ceremony. More specifically the figures show a king kneeling with his arms crossed. The king figure's hair is similar to that of the [Maize God]. Freidel therefore names the unknown deceased individual the Maize King. Beside the king is a deer spirit, possibly healing the king. This deer spirit may have been the \"way\", spirit companion, of a different king watching the ceremony.\n\nA figurine of a female singer conjures the deer spirit. Evidence for this includes the pigtail associated with shaman. She is also full of a red paint, thought to be the color of life. She holds sticks under her arm which may have been quill pens or used for counting. \nBeside the singer is a dwarf wearing a headdress similar to a deer. The dwarf is holding a shell trumpet which may have been used to conjure the deer from the underworld. Above the dwarf is a toad, often symbolic of birth in [ancient Maya] culture. Two other dwarf figurines are wearing helmets and look as if they are about to fight. Freidel suggests they might be boxers. Karl Taube, of the University of California, and Marc Zender, of Harvard University, believe boxing may have been a sport of ancient Meso-America.\n\nTwo figures, thought to be the successor of Waka' and his queen, are situated on the left of the deer spirit. The king figure is called Scribe King because his headdress resembles a monkey and the monkey gods were associated with scribes. The headdress contains a green mask inside a red seashell, held by a thumb. Freidel says this represents life rising from the underworld and the resurrection of the dead ruler's soul.\n\nAnother notable item found in Burial #39 includes an Olmec-like figurine. The figurine was found north of the buried ruler’s head. It was located inside two lip-to-lip cache vessels. The inside of these vessels were coated with a red pigment partially made of cinnabar. According to Michelle Rich, ancient Maya associated cinnabar coated caches, containing offerings, with resurrecting rulers, more specifically the maize god. A trefoil sprout on the crown of the figurine provides further evidence of a connection to the maize god. According to Michelle Rich this is used as a symbol for the maize god.\n\nThe figurine has one leg up, possibly showing dance movement. The left arm is bent and the right arm is missing. The top of the figurine’s head forms a fin. This represents either a fish or shark. The mouth of the figurine resembles a jaguar’s and contains a tooth much like a shark tooth. The crescent shape of the eyes are similar to the Olmec death god’s eyes, connecting the figurine to death. The low eye-lids of the figurine show a cross-bands motif on the right and a U shape on the left. These are often used as symbols of kingship. The figurine also has an engraving of the quatrefoil motif on the back. This suggests the figurine provides a way into the supernatural world.\n\nThe figurine is believed to be an heirloom of a dancing boy, representative of resurrection. This figurine was an important discovery because it is evidence that the ancient Maya knew about the Olmec maize god.\n\nA deposit was found near the main residential compound, referred to as N14-2 by excavators, of the Tolok group. This deposit contained the remains of two individuals, a two-year-old in burial #18 and a middle aged male in burial #19. The man was found under the staircase of N14-2 and had tabular modification of his skull. The two individuals had each been placed between two rocks and buried on top of broken ceramics. It is possible the deceased were sacrifices. Along with these individuals were items that suggested to researches the deposit was used for a ritual feasting event, important for establishing social position. The items included many bowls, plates, vases, bones of animals, ceramic figurines of a jaguar head and monkey wearing a headdress, and musical instruments. Keith Eppich of Southern Methodist University believes the items were intentionally broken in the deposit for the feasting ritual. The location of the deposit gives further indication of a feasting ritual. The ritual occurred at the stairs of N 14-2, a common location for the dedication ritual called Och-Otot which means \"enters house.\" This ritual was an act of paying debt to otherworldly powers and was often used with the construction of new architecture. Eppich says the two individuals were sacrificed and then became the \"soul\" of the building, N14-2.\n\nIn October 2012, the suspected tomb and remains of an important Maya queen were discovered at the site. During excavations led by David Freidel of Washington University in St. Louis uncovered a tomb in the city’s main pyramid temple and it was identified as belonging to Lady Ka’bel, the military ruler of the Wak kingdom between AD672 and 692. The body inside was buried with various offerings, including “ceramic vessels, jade jewellery, stone figurines, and a small alabaster jar carved in the shape of a conch shell, out of which the carved head and arms of an old woman emerge”. Maya hieroglyphs on the back of the jar include the names \"Lady Water Lily Hand\" and \"Lady Snake Lord,\" according to the study team. Both names are thought to refer to Lady K'abel, who governed the Wak kingdom for her family, the empire-building Kan, or \"Snake,\" dynasty, based in the Maya capital Calakmul.\n\nAn altar has been discovered at El Peru, featuring a quatrefoil on the back of a zoomorphic creature in which sits a ruler.\n\"While the imagery bears remarkable similarities to that of Izapa Stela 8, the text of the El Peru altar elucidates the significance of the quatrefoil, describing it as \"tu yol ahk\", 'at the heart af the turtle' or 'in the portal of the turtle', a reference to the creation narrative of the Maize god's rebirth\".\nWhile open to the public, Waka' is a difficult site to get to. It sits atop an escarpment in the Laguna del Tigre National Park (part of the Maya Biosphere Reserve), six kilometers north of the San Pedro River. The site can be reached via an arduous route from Flores, the closest town with an airport (the Mundo Maya International Airport).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5245926", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5245926", "title": "Emakimono", "text": "Emakimono\n\n, often simply called , is a horizontal, illustrated narrative form created during the 11th to 16th centuries in Japan. \"Emakimono\" combines both text and pictures, and is drawn, painted, or stamped on a handscroll. They depict battles, romance, religion, folk tales, and stories of the supernatural world. \n\nThe handscroll and the hanging scroll are the two most common forms of Japanese painting. Handscrolls are painted on paper or silk, backed with paper. The farthest (left) end is fitted with a roller around which the scroll is rolled. When rolled up, the scrolls are secured with a braided silk cord and can be safely carried, placed on shelves, or stored in a lacquerware box. Handscrolls range in size, averaging 30 centimeters (1 ft.) in height and 9 to 12 meters (30 to 40 ft.) in length. A normal story covers one to three scrolls.\n\"Emakimono\" are read by exposing an arms-length of the scroll at a time, from right to left, as Japanese is written. It was common for there to be a written account of the story being illustrated either at the start of the scroll, or interspersed between the pictures. It is expected that the person viewing the scroll will re-roll the scroll back in its original form, much as one is supposed to rewind video tape after viewing it.\n\n\"Emakimono\" also serve as some of the earliest and greatest examples of the \"otoko-e\" (Men's pictures) and \"onna-e\" (Women's pictures) styles of painting. There are many fine differences in the two styles, appealing to the aesthetic preferences of the genders. But perhaps most easily noticeable are the differences in subject matter. \"Onna-e\", epitomized by the Tale of Genji handscroll, typically deals with court life, particularly the court ladies, and with romantic themes. \"Otoko-e\", on the other hand, often recorded historical events, particularly battles. The Siege of the Sanjō Palace (1160), depicted in the painting \"Night Attack on the Sanjō Palace\" is a famous example of this style.\n\nThe most often discussed example of \"emakimono\" is the \"Genji monogatari emaki\" dating from about 1130. This \"emaki\" illustrates Murasaki Shikibu's epic \"The Tale of Genji\". Written about the year 1000, the novel deals with the life and loves of Genji and the world of the Heian court after his death. While only 15% of the original scrolls remain, the fragments are protected as national treasures.\n\nThe \"Chōjū giga\" (Scroll of Frolicking Animals) is unusual in its own medium, as it does not contain any text, only pictures. It depicts scenes of animals in amusing scenes, analogizing Japanese society in the 12th century.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41813255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41813255", "title": "Feminist art criticism", "text": "Feminist art criticism\n\nFeminist art criticism emerged in the 1970s from the wider feminist movement as the critical examination of both visual representations of women in art and art produced by women. It continues to be a major field of art criticism.\n\nLinda Nochlin's 1971 groundbreaking essay, \"Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\", analyzes the embedded privilege in the predominantly white, male, Western art world and argued that women's outsider status allowed them a unique viewpoint to not only critique women's position in art, but to additionally examine the discipline's underlying assumptions about gender and ability. Nochlin's essay develops the argument that both formal and social education restricted artistic development to men, preventing women (with rare exception) from honing their talents and gaining entry into the art world. In the 1970s, feminist art criticism continued this critique of the institutionalized sexism of art history, art museums, and galleries, as well as questioning which genres of art were deemed museum-worthy. This position is articulated by artist Judy Chicago: \"...it is crucial to understand that one of the ways in which the importance of male experience is conveyed is through the art objects that are exhibited and preserved in our museums. Whereas men experience presence in our art institutions, women experience primarily absence, except in images that do not necessarily reflect women's own sense of themselves.\"\n\nNochlin challenges the myth of the Great Artist as 'Genius' as an inherently problematic construct. 'Genius' “is thought of as an atemporal and mysterious power somehow embedded in the person of the Great Artist.”\nThis ‘god-like’ conception of the artist’s role is due to \"the entire romantic, elitist, individual-glorifying, and monograph-producing substructure upon which the profession of art history is based.\" She develops this further by arguing that \"if women had the golden nugget of artistic genius, it would reveal itself. But it has never revealed itself. Q.E.D. Women do not have the golden nugget of artistic genius.\" Nochlin deconstructs the myth of the 'Genius' by highlighting the unjustness in which the Western art world inherently privileges certain predominantly white male artists. In Western art, ‘Genius’ is a title that is generally reserved for artists such as, van Gogh, Picasso, Raphael, and Pollock—all white men. As recently demonstrated by Alessandro Giardino, when the concept of artistic genius started collapsing, women and marginal groups emerged at the forefront of artistic creation.\n\nSimilar to Nochlins’ assertions on women’s position in the art world, art historian Carol Duncan in the 1989 article, “The MoMA Hot Mamas”, examines the idea that institutions like the MoMA are masculinized. In MoMA’s collection, there is a disproportionate amount of sexualized female bodies by male artists on display compared to a low percentage of actual women artists included. According to data accumulated by the Guerrilla Girls, “less than 3% of the artists in the Modern Art section of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art are women, but 83% of the nudes are female”, even though “51% of visual artists today are women.” Duncan claims that, in regards to women artists:\n\nIn the MoMA and other museums, their numbers are kept well below the point where they might effectively dilute its masculinity. The female presence is necessary only in the form of imagery. Of course, men, too, are occasionally represented. Unlike women, who are seen primarily as sexually accessible bodies, men are portrayed as physically and mentally active beings who creatively shape their world and ponder its meanings.\n\nThis article narrows its focus on one institution to use as an example to draw from and expand on. Ultimately to illustrate the ways in which institutions are complicit in patriarchal and racist ideologies.\n\nWomen of color in the art world were often not addressed in earlier feminist art criticism. An intersectional analysis that includes not only gender but also race and other marginalized identities is essential.\n\nAudre Lorde’s 1984 essay “The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle The Master’s House,” briefly addresses a vital dilemma that artists who are women of color are often overlooked or tokenized in the visual arts. She argues that \"in academic feminist circles, the answer to these questions is often, ‘We did not know who to ask.’ But that is the same evasion of responsibility, the same cop-out, that keeps Black women's art out of women's exhibitions, Black women's work out of most feminist publications except for the occasional ‘Special Third World Women's Issue,’ and Black women's texts off your reading lists.” Lorde’s statement brings up how important it is to consider intersectionality in these feminist art discourses, as race is just as integral to any discussion on gender.\n\nFurthermore, bell hooks expands on the discourse of black representation in the visual arts to include other factors. In her 1995 book, \"Art on My Mind\", hooks positions her writings on the visual politics of both race and class in the art world. She states that the reason art is rendered meaningless in the lives of most black people is not solely due to the lack of representation, but also because of an entrenched colonization of the mind and imagination and how it is intertwined with the process of identification. Thus she stresses for a “shift [in] conventional ways of thinking about the function of art. There must be a revolution in the way we see, the way we look,\" emphasizing how visual art has the potential to be an empowering force within the black community. Especially if one can break free from \"imperialist white-supremacist notions of the way art should look and function in society.\"\n\nFeminist art criticism is a smaller subgroup in the larger realm of feminist theory, because feminist theory seeks to explore the themes of discrimination, sexual objectification, oppression, patriarchy, and stereotyping, feminist art criticism attempts similar exploration.\n\nThis exploration can be accomplished through a variety of means. Structuralist theories, deconstructionist thought, psychoanalysis, queer analysis, and semiotic interpretations can be used to further comprehend gender symbolism and representation in artistic works. The social structures regarding gender that influence a piece can be understood through interpretations based on stylistic influences and biographical interpretations.\n\nLaura Mulvey's 1975 essay, \"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\" focuses on the gaze of the spectator from a Freudian perspective. Freud's concept of scopophilia relates to the objectification of women in art works. The gaze of the viewer is, in essence, a sexually charged instinct. Because of the gender inequity that exists in the art sphere, the artist's portrayal of a subject is generally a man's portrayal of women. Other Freudian symbolism can be used to comprehend pieces of art from a feminist perspective—whether gender specific symbols are uncovered through psychoanalytic theory (such as phallic or yonic symbols) or specific symbols are used to represent women in a given piece.\n\nAre the women depicted in an artistic work realistic portrayals of women? Writer Toril Moi explained in her 1985 essay \"'Images of Women' Criticism\" that \"reflectionism posits that the artist's selective creation should be measured against 'real life,' thus assuming that the only constraint on the artist's work is his or her perception of the 'real world.'\"\n\nThe 1970s also saw the emergence of feminist art journals, including \"The Feminist Art Journal\" in 1972 and \"\" in 1977. The journal \"n.paradoxa\" has been dedicated to an international perspective on feminist art since 1996.\n\nImportant publications on feminist art criticism include:\n\nIn 1989, the Guerilla Girls' poster protest of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's gender imbalance brought this feminist critique out of the academy and into the public sphere.\n\nIn 2007, the exhibit \"WACK! Art and the Feminist Revolution\" presented works of 120 international artists and artists’ groups at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. It was the first show of its kind that employed a comprehensive view of the intersection between feminism and art from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. WACK! “argues that feminism was perhaps the most influential of any postwar art movement-on an international level-in its impact on subsequent generations of artists.”\n\nRosemary Betteron’s 2003 essay, “Feminist Viewing: Viewing Feminism”, insists that older feminist art criticism must adapt to newer models, as our culture has shifted significantly since the late twentieth century. Betterton points out:\n\nFeminist art criticism is no longer the marginalized discourse that it once was; indeed it had produced some brilliant and engaging writing over the last decade and in many ways has become a key site of academic production. But, as feminist writers and teachers, we need to address ways of thinking through new forms of social engagement between feminism and the visual, and of understanding the different ways in which visual culture is currently inhabited by our students.\n\nAccording to Betterton, the models used to critique a Pre-Raphaelite painting are not likely to be applicable in the twenty-first century. She also expresses that we should explore ‘difference’ in position and knowledge, since in our contemporary visual culture we are more used to engaging with \"multi-layered text and image complexes\" (video, digital media, and the Internet). Our ways of viewing have changed considerably since the 1970s.\n\n"}
{"id": "7959499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7959499", "title": "Generalized quantifier", "text": "Generalized quantifier\n\nIn linguistic semantics, a generalized quantifier (GQ) is an expression that denotes a set of sets. This is the standard semantics assigned to quantified noun phrases. For example, the generalized quantifier \"every boy\" denotes the set of sets of which every boy is a member. \n\nThis treatment of quantifiers has been essential in achieving a compositional semantics for sentences containing quantifiers.\n\nA version of type theory is often used to make the semantics of different kinds of expressions explicit. The standard construction defines the set of types recursively as follows:\n\nGiven this definition, we have the simple types \"e\" and \"t\", but also a countable infinity of complex types, some of which include:\n\n\nWe can now assign types to the words in our sentence above (Every boy sleeps) as follows.\n\nThus, every denotes a function from a \"set\" to a function from a set to a truth value. Put differently, it denotes a function from a set to a set of sets. It is that function which for any two sets \"A,B\", \"every\"(\"A\")(\"B\")= 1 if and only if formula_15.\n\nA useful way to write complex functions is the lambda calculus. For example, one can write the meaning of \"sleeps\" as the following lambda expression, which is a function from an individual \"x\" to the proposition that \"x sleeps\".\nSuch lambda terms are functions whose domain is what precedes the period, and whose range are the type of thing that follows the period. If \"x\" is a variable that ranges over elements of formula_4, then the following lambda term denotes the identity function on individuals:\n\nWe can now write the meaning of \"every\" with the following lambda term, where \"X,Y\" are variables of type formula_6:\n\nIf we abbreviate the meaning of \"boy\" and \"sleeps\" as \"\"B\" and \"S\"\", respectively, we have that the sentence \"every boy sleeps\" now means the following:\n\nThe expression \"every\" is a determiner. Combined with a noun, it yields a \"generalized quantifier\" of type formula_24.\n\nA \"generalized quantifier\" GQ is said to be monotone increasing, also called upward entailing, just in case, for any two sets \"X\" and \"Y\" the following holds:\nThe GQ \"every boy\" is monotone increasing. For example, the set of things that \"run fast\" is a subset of the set of things that \"run\". Therefore, the first sentence below entails the second:\n\nA GQ is said to be monotone decreasing, also called downward entailing just in case, for any two sets \"X\" and \"Y\", the following holds:\nAn example of a monotone decreasing GQ is \"no boy\". For this GQ we have that the first sentence below entails the second.\nThe lambda term for the determiner \"no\" is the following. It says that the two sets have an empty intersection.\nMonotone decreasing GQs are among the expressions that can license a negative polarity item, such as \"any\". Monotone increasing GQs do not license negative polarity items.\n\nA GQ is said to be \"non-monotone\" if it is neither monotone increasing nor monotone decreasing. An example of such a GQ is \"exactly three boys\". Neither of the following two sentences entail the other.\nThe first sentence doesn't entail the second. The fact that the number of students that ran is exactly three doesn't entail that each of these students \"ran fast\", so the number of students that did that can be smaller than 3. Conversely, the second sentence doesn't entail the first. The sentence \"exactly three students ran fast\" can be true, even though the number of students who merely ran (i.e. not so fast) is greater than 3.\n\nThe lambda term for the (complex) determiner \"exactly three\" is the following. It says that the cardinality of the intersection between the two sets equals 3.\n\nA determiner D is said to be \"conservative\" if the following equivalence holds:\nFor example, the following two sentences are equivalent.\n\nIt has been proposed that \"all\" natural language determiners (i.e. in every language) are conservative (Barwise and Cooper 1981). The expression \"only\" is not conservative. The following two sentences are not equivalent. But it is, in fact not common to analyze \"only\" as a determiner. Rather, it is standardly treated as a focus-sensitive adverb.\n\n\n\n"}

Now the Glencairn Museum, it contains a collection of about 8,000 artworks, mostly religious in nature, from cultures such as ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, the Roman Empire and medieval Europe, as well as Islamic, Asian, and Native American works. The museum is affiliated with The New Church, and the building is on the National Register of Historic Places. \n\nMulti-millionaire businessman Raymond Pitcairn (1885–1966) and his wife, Mildred Glenn (died 1979) built \"Glencairn\" between 1928 and 1939. Its name was a combination of their surnames. Pitcairn, a member of the New Church himself, had no formal training in architecture and designed the Romanesque-style building using a series of models. The nine-story, granite-and-ruddy-colored-stone mansion features more than 90 rooms on 10 floors. It has three main sections – a central rectangle, and two large rectangular wings – that together measure approximately 175 feet by 135 feet. The exterior features a nine-story tower, carved doorways, pillars, and wall insets. The building also contains elaborate interior mosaics, monel metalwork, Early Medieval stained glass windows, and a replica of the Biblical tabernacle.\n\nThe Pitcairn fortune derived from control of Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company, of which his father John Pitcairn, Jr. (1841-1916), was director, 1896-1906. Adjacent to \"Glencairn\" is Raymond Pitcairn's first architectural success, the Gothic Revival Bryn Athyn Cathedral (1913–19), and his father's house \"Cairnwood.\" The Pitcairns were funders of the American Liberty League. Following Mildred's death in 1979 (Raymond died in 1966), the mansion, with its collections and Pitcairn archives, was given to the Academy of the New Church. \n\n\"Glencairn\" was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and is a contributing property of the Bryn Athyn Historic District.\n\nGuided tours of the building and collection are available year-round. Tours are offered Tuesday through Friday at 2:30pm or by appointment, and weekends at 1:00, 1:45, 2:30 and 3pm. The Museum's first floor, including the Great Hall, Upper Hall, Bird Room, and current temporary exhibition, is open free of charge for self-guided viewing on weekends from 1:00 to 4:30 pm.\n\nGlencairn Museum also offers a variety of events and exhibitions throughout the year.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "324398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324398", "title": "In God We Trust", "text": "In God We Trust\n\n\"In God We Trust\" is the official motto of the United States of America, Nicaragua, and of the U.S. state of Florida. It was adopted as the nation's motto in 1956 as a replacement or alternative to the unofficial motto of \"E pluribus unum\", which was adopted when the Great Seal of the United States was created and adopted in 1782.\n\n\"In God We Trust\" first appeared on the two-cent piece in 1864 and has appeared on paper currency since 1957. A law passed in a Joint Resolution by the 84th Congress (P.L. 84-140) and approved by President Dwight Eisenhower on July 30, 1956, declared \"In God We Trust\" must appear on American currency. This phrase was first used on paper money in 1957, when it appeared on the one-dollar silver certificate. The first paper currency bearing the phrase entered circulation on October 1, 1957. The 84th Congress later passed legislation (P.L. 84-851), also signed by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1956, declaring the phrase to be the national motto.\n\nSome groups and people have expressed objections to its use, citing its religious reference that violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. These groups believe the phrase should be removed from currency and public property. In lawsuits, this argument has so far not overcome the interpretational doctrine of accommodationism, which allows government to endorse religious establishments as long as they are all treated equally. According to a 2003 joint poll by USA Today, CNN, and Gallup, 90% of Americans support the inscription \"In God We Trust\" on U.S. coins.\n\nIn 2006, \"In God We Trust\" was designated as the motto of the U.S. state of Florida. Its Spanish equivalent, \"En Dios Confiamos,\" is the motto of the Republic of Nicaragua.\n\nIn 1860, the phrase was used in the Coat of arms of New Westminster, Canada. The phrase has been included in many hymns and religious-patriotic songs. During the American Civil War, the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry for the Union Army assumed the motto \"In God we trust\" in early August 1862. William W. Wallace, coiner, circa August 1862, of the motto \"In God We Trust\" was Captain of Company C of the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry.\n\nThe Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of 'Ridleyville', Pennsylvania, (pastor of Prospect Hill Baptist Church in present-day Prospect Park, Pennsylvania) in a letter dated November 13, 1861, petitioned the Treasury Department to add a statement recognizing \"Almighty God in some form on our coins\" in order to \"relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism\". At least part of the motivation was to declare that God was on the Union side of the Civil War. Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase acted on this proposal and directed the then-Philadelphia Director of the Mint, James Pollock, to begin drawing up possible designs that would include the religious phrase. Chase chose his favorite designs and presented a proposal to Congress for the new designs in late 1863.\n\nIn December 1863, Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto, \"In God We Trust,\" to engrave on U.S. coins. Lincoln's involvement in this decision is unclear.\n\nA version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the twenty dollar interest bearing note issued in 1864 along with the motto \"God and our Right\".\n\nAs Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress, it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18, 1837 prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States. This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress. Such legislation was introduced and passed as the Coinage Act of 1864 on April 22, 1864, allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one-cent and two-cent coins.\n\nAn Act of Congress passed on March 3, 1865, allowed the Mint Director, with the Secretary's approval, to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that \"shall admit the inscription thereon\". In 1873, Congress passed the Coinage Act, granting that the Secretary of the Treasury \"may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto\".\n\nThe similar phrase 'In God is our Trust' appears in \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931. Written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812, the fourth stanza includes the phrase, \"And this be our motto: 'In God is our Trust'\", which was adapted as the national motto.\n\nThe use of \"In God We Trust\" has been interrupted. The motto disappeared from the five-cent coin in 1883, and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938. However, at least two other coins minted in every year in the interim still bore the motto, including the Morgan dollar and the Seated Liberty half dollar. The omission of the motto \"In God We Trust\" on the Indian Head eagle coin caused public outrage, and prompted Congress to pass a bill mandating its inclusion. Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber added the words and made minor modifications to the design. In 1908, Congress made it mandatory that the phrase be printed on all coins upon which it had previously appeared. This decision was motivated after a public outcry following the release of a $20 coin which did not bear the motto. The motto has been in continuous use on the one-cent coin since 1909, and on the ten-cent coin since 1916. It also has appeared on all gold coins and silver dollar coins, half-dollar coins, and quarter-dollar coins struck since July 1, 1908. Since 1938, all US coins have borne the motto.\nDuring the Cold War era, the government of the United States sought to distinguish itself from the Soviet Union, which promoted state atheism and thus implemented antireligious legislation. The 84th Congress passed a joint resolution \"declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States\". The resolution passed both the House and the Senate unanimously and without debate. The law was signed by President Eisenhower on July 30, 1956. The United States Code at , now states: \"'In God we trust' is the national motto.\"\n\nThe same day, the President signed into law a requirement that \"In God We Trust\" be printed on all U.S. currency and coins. On paper currency, it first appeared on the silver certificate in 1957, followed by other certificates. Federal Reserve Notes and United States Notes were circulated with the motto starting from 1964 to 1966, depending on the denomination. (Of these, only Federal Reserve Notes are still circulated.)\n\nRepresentative Charles Edward Bennett of Florida cited the Cold War when he introduced the bill in the House, saying \"In these days when imperialistic and materialistic communism seeks to attack and destroy freedom, we should continually look for ways to strengthen the foundations of our freedom\".\nAronow v. United States was the first case to challenge the inclusion of \"In God We Trust\" on U.S. currency. The law it challenged was \"31 U.S.C. § 324a \"the inscription 'In God we Trust'...shall appear on all United States currency and coins\". O'Hair v. Blumenthal (1978) challenged the inclusion of the phrase \"In God We Trust\" on U.S. currency. A similar decision was reached by the Fifth Circuit in Madalyn Murray O'Hair vs W. Michael Blumenthal in 1979, which affirmed that the \"primary purpose of the slogan was secular.\"\n\nIn March 2001, Governor of Mississippi Ronnie Musgrove signed legislation requiring the motto \"In God We Trust\" to be displayed in every public school classroom, as well as the school auditoriums and cafeterias, throughout the state.\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, many public schools across the United States posted \"In God We Trust\" framed posters in their \"libraries, cafeterias and classrooms\". The American Family Association supplied several 11-by-14-inch posters to school systems and vowed to defend any legal challenges to the displaying of the posters.\n\nAccording to a 2003 joint poll by \"USA Today\", CNN, and Gallup, 90% of Americans support the inscription \"In God We Trust\" on U.S. coins.\n\nIn 2006, on the 50th anniversary of its adoption, the Senate reaffirmed \"In God We Trust\" as the official national motto of the United States of America. In Florida House Bill no. 1145, Florida adopted 'In God We Trust' as the official state motto, effective July 1, 2006.\n\nIn 2011 the House of Representatives passed an additional resolution reaffirming \"In God We Trust\" as the official motto of the United States, in a 396–9 vote.\n\nIn 2013, a federal court rejected a challenge, brought by Michael Newdow and the Freedom From Religion Foundation, to remove \"In God We Trust\" from American currency.\nOn January 31, 2014, purporting to defend religious freedom, the Mississippi senate voted to add the words, \"In God We Trust\" to the state seal and the change was made effective on July 1, 2014.\n\nIn 2015 the county police department of Jefferson County, Illinois announced that the words \"In God We Trust\" will be on police squad cars. In 2015, the Freedom from Religion Foundation demanded that local authorities remove decals of the motto from Childress, Texas Police Department patrol vehicles. In response, Police Chief Adrian Garcia told the organization, in a written letter, to \"go fly a kite.\"\n\nIn March 2017, Act 911, sponsored by State Rep. Jim Dotson, made it a requirement of Arkansas state law for schools to display posters with the national motto (\"In God We Trust\").\n\nIn early 2018, Kimberly Daniels, a pastor who currently serves as the representative for Florida House of Representatives District 14 as a member of the Democratic Party, introduced HB 839, a bill that requires public schools to display the motto \"In God We Trust\" in a conspicuous place. On Tuesday, January 23, 2018, the bill received unanimous approval from the House PreK-12 Innovation Subcommittee. Later, in a vote on February 21, 2018, the bill passed 97 to 10 in the House. As part of Florida's March 2018 K-12 education law, Gov. Rick Scott mandated that all public schools post the state motto (\"In God We Trust\") in a prominent location.\n\nIn March 2018, a bill requiring Tennessee schools to prominently display the national motto (\"In God We Trust\") sponsored by Rep. Susan Lynn passed the state House with 81 of the 99 members voting in favor of it.\n\nIn Judaism and Christianity, the official motto \"In God We Trust\" resounds with several verses from the Bible, including , , , , and . Melkote Ramaswamy, a Hindu American scholar, writes that the presence of the phrase \"In God We Trust\" on American currency is a reminder that \"there is God everywhere, whether we are conscious or not.\"\n\n\nAdvocates of separation of church and state have questioned the legality of this motto asserting that it is a violation of the United States Constitution, prohibiting the government from passing any law respecting an establishment of religion. Religious accommodationists state that this entrenched practice has not historically presented any constitutional difficulty, is not coercive, and does not prefer one religious denomination over another.\n\n\"In God We Trust\" as a national motto and on U.S. currency has been the subject of numerous unsuccessful lawsuits. The motto was first challenged in \"Aronow v. United States\" in 1970, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled: \"It is quite obvious that the national motto and the slogan on coinage and currency 'In God We Trust' has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment of religion. Its use is of patriotic or ceremonial character and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise.\" In \"Lynch v. Donnelly\" (1984), the Supreme Court wrote that acts of \"ceremonial deism\" are \"protected from Establishment Clause scrutiny chiefly because they have lost through rote repetition any significant religious content\". In \"Zorach v. Clauson\" (1952), the Supreme Court also wrote that the nation's \"institutions presuppose a Supreme Being\" and that government recognition of God does not constitute the establishment of a state church as the Constitution's authors intended to prohibit.\n\nIn November 2005, Michael Newdow announced he wants to have \"In God We Trust\" removed from U.S. coins and banknotes. In 2004, he received the special Recognition Freethought Hero Award for his case to remove \"In God We Trust\" from currency. In a November 14, 2005 interview with Fox News's Neil Cavuto, Newdow compared \"In God We Trust\" appearing on United States currency with racial segregation (specifically separate drinking fountains), saying, \"How can you not compare those? What is the difference there? Both of them [whites and blacks] got equal water. They both had access. It was government saying that it's okay to separate out these two people on the basis of race. Here we're saying it's okay to separate two people on the basis of their religious beliefs.\"\n\nIn June 2006, a federal judge rejected Newdow's Establishment Clause lawsuit on the grounds that the minted words amount to a secular national slogan, and do not dictate anyone's beliefs. Newdow stated that he would appeal the ruling, although it should be noted that \"Aronow v. United States\" was decided on the same grounds in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the lower court was required to return the same ruling, likewise the Ninth Circuit does not traditionally overrule previous Ninth Circuit rulings.\n\nOn December 4, 2007, Newdow argued before a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit to remove both \"under God\" from the Pledge of Allegiance (\"Roe v. Rio Linda Union School District\"), and \"In God We Trust\" from United States currency. The Ninth Circuit rejected Newdow's challenge. In a decision published March 11, 2010, the court held that its earlier decision in \"Aronow\", which \"held the national motto is of a \"patriotic or ceremonial character,\" has no \"theological or ritualistic impact,\" and does not constitute \"governmental sponsorship of a religious exercise,\" foreclosed Newdow's argument. In an opinion concurring only in the judgment, even the extremely liberal Judge Stephen Reinhardt agreed that \"Aronow\" was controlling precedent.\n\n\"Newdow v. Congress\", 598 F.3d 638 (9th Cir. 2010) cert. denied 131 S. Ct. 1612 (U.S. 2011). AKA: The \"In God We Trust Case\" – A prominent atheist, Michael Newdow, filed a suit to declare the national motto – In God We Trust – unconstitutional and to have it removed from coins and currency. Pacific Justice Institute intervened as a defendant and defended against the suit. The case was dismissed by the trial court and the Ninth Circuit affirmed that decision.\n\nIn 2015, David F. Bauman dismissed a case against the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District brought by a student of the district and the American Humanist Association that argued that the phrase \"under God\" in the Pledge of Allegiance created a climate of discrimination because it promoted religion, making non-believers \"second-class citizens\". He noted; \"As a matter of historical tradition, the words 'under God' can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words 'In God We Trust' from every coin in the land, than the words 'so help me God' from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787.\"\n\nAside from constitutional objections, President Theodore Roosevelt took issue with using the motto on coinage as he considered using God's name on money to be sacrilege.\n\nIn September 2014, a proposal to add displays of \"In God We Trust\" on public property in Ballwin, Missouri was defeated following a plea to a meeting of aldermen by a local atheist.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17154", "title": "Kit Carson", "text": "Kit Carson\n\nChristopher Houston Carson (December 24, 1809 – May 23, 1868), better known as Kit Carson, was an American frontiersman. He was a mountain man (fur trapper), wilderness guide, Indian agent, and U.S. Army officer. Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles. Often exaggerated, versions of his exploits were the subject of dime novels. His understated nature belied confirmed reports of his fearlessness, combat skills, tenacity, and profound effect on the westward expansion of the United States.\n\nCarson left home in rural present-day Missouri at age 16 to become a mountain man and trapper in the West. In the 1830s, he accompanied Ewing Young on an expedition to Mexican California and joined fur-trapping expeditions into the Rocky Mountains. He lived among and married into the Arapaho and Cheyenne tribes.\n\nIn the 1840s, Carson was hired as a guide by John C. Frémont. Frémont's expeditions covered much of California, Oregon, and the Great Basin area. Frémont mapped and wrote reports and commentaries on the Oregon Trail to assist and encourage westward-bound American pioneers. Carson achieved national fame through Frémont's accounts of his expeditions. Under Frémont's command, Carson participated in the conquest of Mexican California at the beginning of the Mexican–American War. Later in the war, Carson was a scout and courier, celebrated for his rescue mission after the Battle of San Pasqual and for his coast-to-coast journey from California to Washington, D.C. to deliver news of the conflict in California to the U.S. government. In the 1850s, he was appointed as the Indian agent to the Ute Indians and the Jicarilla Apaches.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Carson led a regiment of mostly Hispanic volunteers from New Mexico on the side of the Union at the Battle of Valverde in 1862. When the Confederate threat to New Mexico was eliminated, Carson led forces to suppress the Navajo, Mescalero Apache, and the Kiowa and Comanche peoples by destroying their food sources.\n\nCarson was brevetted a Brigadier General and took command of Fort Garland, Colorado. He was there only briefly: poor health forced him to retire from military life. Carson was married three times and had ten children. The Carson home was in Taos, New Mexico. Carson died at Fort Lyon, Colorado, of an aortic aneurysm on May 23, 1868. He is buried in Taos, New Mexico, next to his third wife, Josefa Jaramillo.\n\nCarson was born in Kentucky on Christmas Eve, 1809. His parents were Lindsay (or Lindsey) Carson and his second wife, Rebecca Robinson. Lindsay had had five children by his first wife Lucy Bradley, and ten more children by Rebecca. Kit was their sixth, making him the eleventh of Lindsay's offspring.\n\nLindsay Carson had a Scots-Irish Presbyterian background. He was a farmer, a cabin builder, and a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. He fought Indians on the American frontier, losing two fingers on his left hand in a battle with the Fox and Sauk Indians.\n\nThe Carson family moved to Boone's Lick, Howard County, Missouri, when Kit was about one year old. The family settled on a tract of land owned by the sons of Daniel Boone, who had purchased the land from the Spanish. The Boone and Carson families became good friends, working and socializing together, and intermarrying. Lindsay's oldest son William married Boone's grand-niece, Millie Boone, in 1810. Their daughter Adaline became Kit's favorite playmate.\n\nMissouri was then the frontier of American expansionism west; cabins were \"forted\" with tall stockade fences to defend against Indian attacks. As men worked in the fields, sentries were posted with weapons, to protect the farmers. These men were ready to kill any Indian who attacked. Carson wrote in his \"Memoirs\": \"For two or three years after our arrival, we had to remain forted and it was necessary to have men stationed at the extremities of the fields for the protection of those that were laboring.\"\n\nIn 1818 Lindsay Carson died instantly when a tree limb fell on him while he was clearing a field. Kit was about 8 years old. Despite being penniless, his mother took care of her children alone for four years. She then married Joseph Martin, a widower with several children. Kit was a young teenager at the time and did not get along with his stepfather. The decision was made to apprentice him to David Workman, a saddler in Franklin, Missouri. Kit wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that Workman was \"a good man, and I often recall the kind treatment I received.\"\n\nFranklin was situated at the eastern end of the Santa Fe Trail, which had opened two years earlier. Many of the customers at the saddle shop were trappers and traders, from whom Carson heard stirring tales of the West. Carson found work in the saddlery not to his taste: he once stated \"the business did not suit me, and I concluded to leave\".\n\nIn August 1826, against his mother's wishes, Kit ran away from his apprenticeship. He went west with a caravan of fur trappers, tending their livestock. They made their trek over the Santa Fe Trail to Santa Fe, the capital of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, reaching their destination in November 1826. Kit settled in Taos.\n\nCarson lived with Mathew Kinkead, a trapper and explorer who had served with Carson's older brothers during the War of 1812. Carson was mentored by Kinkead in learning the skills of a trapper, while learning the necessary languages for trade. Eventually he became fluent in Spanish and several Indian languages.\n\nWorkman put an advertisement in a local newspaper back in Missouri. He wrote that he would give a one cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin. No one claimed the reward. It was a bit of a joke, but Carson was free. The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: \"Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, small of his age, but thick set; light hair, ran away from the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler's trade.\"\n\nBetween 1827 and 1829, Carson worked as cook, translator, and wagon driver in the southwest. He also worked at a copper mine near the Gila River in southwestern New Mexico. In later life, Carson never mentioned any women from his youth. There are only three specific women mentioned in his writing: Josefa Jaramillo, his third and last wife; a comrade's mother in Washington, DC; and Mrs. Ann White, a victim of Indian atrocities.\n\nAt the age of nineteen, Carson began his career as a mountain man. He traveled through many parts of the American West with famous mountain men like Jim Bridger and Old Bill Williams. He spent the winter of 1828–1829 as a cook for Ewing Young in Taos. He joined Young's trapping expedition of 1829. The leadership of Young and the experience of the venture are credited with shaping Carson's early life in the mountains.\n\nDuring August 1829 the party went into Apache country along the Gila River. The expedition was attacked, being Carson's first experience of combat. Young's party continued on into Alta California trapping and trading in California from Sacramento in the north to Los Angeles in the south, returning to Taos, New Mexico in April 1830 after trapping along the Colorado River.\n\nCarson joined a wagon train rescue party after entering Taos, and although the perpetrators had fled the scene of atrocities Young had the opportunity to witness Carson's horsemanship and courage. Carson joined another expedition led by Thomas Fitzpatrick and William Levin in 1831. Fitzpatrick, Levin and his trappers went north to the central Rocky Mountains. Carson would hunt and trap in the West for about ten years. He was known as a reliable man and a good fighter.\n\nLife for Carson as a mountain man was not easy. After collecting beavers from traps, he had to hold onto them for months at a time until the annual Rocky Mountain Rendezvous, held in remote areas of the West like the banks of the Green River in Wyoming. With the money received for the pelts, necessities of an independent life including fish hooks, flour and tobacco were procured. As there was little to no medical access in the varied regions he worked in, Carson had to dress his wounds and nurse himself. Conflict with particular Indians sometimes occurred. Carson's primary clothing at the time was in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time. This suit offered some protection against particular weapons employed by Indians.\n\nGrizzly bears were one of the mountain man's greatest enemies. A particular incident involving the animals happened to Carson in 1834 as he was hunting an elk alone. Two bears crossed paths with him and quickly chased him up a tree. One of the bears tried to make him fall by shaking the tree, but was not successful and eventually went away. Carson returned to his camp as fast as he could. He wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that: \"[The bear] finally concluded to leave, of which I was heartily pleased, never having been so scared in my life.\"\n\nThe last rendezvous was held in 1840. At that time, the fur trade began to drop off. Fashionable men in London, Paris, and New York wanted silk hats instead of beaver hats. In addition, beaver populations across North America were declining rapidly from over-exploitation. Carson knew it was time to find other work. He wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that \"Beaver was getting scarce, it became necessary to try our hand at something else.\"\n\nIn 1841, he was hired at Bent's Fort in Colorado, at the largest building on the Santa Fe Trail. Hundreds of people worked or lived there. Carson hunted buffalo, antelope, deer, and other animals to feed these people. He was paid one dollar a day. He returned to Bent's Fort several times during his life to again provide meat for the fort's residents.\n\nCarson was nineteen when he set off with Ewing Young's expedition to the Rocky Mountains in 1829. In addition to furs and the company of free-spirited, rugged mountain men, Carson sought action and adventure. He found what he was looking for in killing and scalping Indians. Carson probably killed and took the scalp of his first Indian when he was nineteen years old, during Ewing Young's expedition.\n\nCarson's \"Memoirs\" are replete with stories about hostile Indian encounters with the memoirist. In January 1833, for example, warriors of the Crow tribe stole nine horses from Carson's camp. Carson and two other men sprayed the Crow camp with gunfire, killing almost every Crow. Carson wrote in his \"Memoirs\": \"During our pursuit for the lost animals, we suffered considerably but, the success of having recovered our horses and sending many a redskin to his long home, our sufferings were soon forgotten.\"\n\nCarson viewed the Blackfoot nation as a hostile tribe, believing they posed the greatest threat to his livelihood, safety, and life. He hated the Blackfeet, and killed them at every opportunity. Historian David Roberts has written: \"It was taken for granted that the Blackfeet were bad Indians; to shoot them whenever he could was a mountain man's instinct and duty.\"\n\nCarson had several encounters with the Blackfeet. His last battle with the Blackfeet took place in spring 1838. He was traveling with about one hundred mountain men led by Jim Bridger. In Montana territory, the group found a teepee with three Indian corpses inside. These three had died of smallpox. Bridger wanted to move on, but Carson and the other young men wanted to kill the Blackfeet.\n\nThey found the Blackfoot village and killed ten Blackfeet warriors. The Blackfeet found some safety in a pile of rocks but were driven away. It is not known how many Blackfeet died in this incident. Historian David Roberts writes: \"[I]f anything like pity filled Carson's breast as, in his twenty-ninth year, he beheld the ravaged camp of the Blackfeet, he did not bother to remember it.\" Carson wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that this battle was \"the prettiest fight I ever saw.\"\n\nCarson's notions about Indians softened over the years. He found himself more and more in their company as he grew older. His notions about Indians became more understanding and more humane. He urged the government to set aside lands called reservations for their use. As an Indian agent, he saw to it that those under his watch were treated with honesty, fairness, and clothed and fed properly. Historian David Roberts believes his first marriage to an Arapaho woman named Singing Grass \"softened the stern and pragmatic mountaineer's opportunism.\"\n\nIn April 1842, Carson went back to his childhood home in Missouri to put his daughter Adaline in the care of relatives. On the return trip, Carson met John C. Frémont aboard a steamboat on the Missouri River. Frémont was a United States Army officer in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. He was about to lead an expedition into the West. After a brief conversation, Frémont hired Carson as a guide at $100 a month. It was the best-paying job of Carson's life. Frémont wrote, \"I was pleased with him and his manner of address at this first meeting. He was a man of medium height, broad-shouldered, and deep-chested, with a clear steady blue eye and frank speech and address; quiet and unassuming.\"\n\nIn 1842, Carson guided Frémont across the Oregon Trail to South Pass, Wyoming. This was their first expedition into the West together. The purpose of this expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail as far as South Pass. A guidebook, maps, and other paraphernalia would be printed for westward-bound migrants and settlers. After the five-month, trouble-free mission was accomplished, Frémont wrote his government reports. These reports made Carson's name known across the United States, and spurred a migration of settlers westward to Oregon via the Oregon Trail.\n\nIn 1843, Carson agreed to join Frémont's second expedition. He guided Frémont across part of the Oregon Trail to the Columbia River in Oregon. The purpose of the expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail from South Pass, Wyoming to the Columbia River. They also side-tripped to Great Salt Lake in Utah, using a rubber raft to navigate the waters. On the way to California, the party suffered from bad weather in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, but were saved by Carson's good judgement and his skills as a guide. They found American settlers who fed them. The expedition then headed to California. This was illegal and dangerous because California was Mexican territory. The Mexican government ordered Frémont to leave. Frémont finally went back to Washington, D.C. The government liked his reports, but ignored his illegal trip into Mexico. Frémont was made a captain. The newspapers nicknamed him \"The Pathfinder\".\n\nDuring this expedition, Frémont trekked into the Mojave Desert. His party met a Mexican man and boy. The two told Carson that Native Americans had ambushed their party of travelers. The male travelers were killed; the women travelers were staked to the ground, sexually mutilated, and killed. The murderers then stole the Mexicans' thirty horses. Carson and a mountain man friend named Alexis Godey went after the murderers. They took two days to find them. They rushed into their camp, killing and scalping two of the murderers. The stolen horses were recovered and returned to the Mexican man and boy. This deed brought Carson even greater fame. It confirmed his status as a western hero in the eyes of the American people.\n\nIn 1845, Carson guided Frémont on their third and last expedition. They went to California and Oregon. Frémont made scientific plans, but the expedition appeared to be political in nature. Frémont may have been working under secret government orders. President Polk wanted the province of Alta California for the United States. Once in California, Frémont started to rouse the American settlers into a patriotic fervor. The Mexican government ordered him to leave. Frémont went north to Oregon, though not before instigating the Sacramento River massacre, in which at least 150 Indians were killed in an unprovoked attack. The party moved up along the Sacramento River, continuing to kill Indians as they went, then camped near Klamath Lake. Messages from Washington, DC made it clear that President Polk wanted California.\n\nAt Klamath Lake in southern Oregon, Frémont's party was hit in a revenge attack by 15–20 Indians on the night of May 9, 1846. Two or three men in camp were killed. The attackers fled after a brief struggle. Carson was angry that his friends had been killed. He took an axe and avenged the death of his friends by chopping away at a dead Indian's face. Frémont wrote, \"He knocked his head to pieces.\"\n\nIn retaliation for the attack, a few days later Frémont's party massacred a village of Klamath people along the Williamson River in the Klamath Lake massacre. The entire village was razed and at least 14 men, women and children were killed. There was no evidence that the village in question had anything to do with the previous attack.\n\nIn June 1846, Frémont and Carson both participated in a California uprising against Mexico called the Bear Flag Revolt. Mexico ordered all Americans to leave California. They did not want to go, and declared California an independent republic. American settlers in California wanted to be free of the Mexican government. The Americans found courage to oppose Mexico because they had Frémont and his troops behind them. Frémont wrote an oath of allegiance. He and his men were able to give some protection to the Americans. He ordered Carson to execute an old Mexican man named José de los Reyes Berreyesa and his two adult nephews. These three were captured when they stepped ashore at San Francisco Bay. They were executed to keep them from taking reports to Mexico about the uprising.\n\nFrémont worked hard to win California for the United States. Fremont for a time fashioned himself as its military governor, until being replaced by General Kearney, who out-ranked him. Carson took military records to the Secretary of War in Washington, DC. Frémont wrote, \"This was a service of great trust and honor ... and great danger also.\" In 1847 and 1848, Carson made two quick trips to Washington, DC with messages and reports. In 1848, he took news of the California Gold Strike to the nation's capitol.\n\nIn July 1853, Carson was in northern Nevada, with 7,000 sheep from Santa Fe. He was taking them to settlers in northern California, and southern Oregon. Carson had with him six \"Spaniards\" (possibly Basques) to herd the sheep.\n\nCarson's fame spread throughout the United States with government reports, dime novels, newspaper accounts, and word of mouth. The dime novels celebrated Carson's adventures, but were usually colored with exaggeration. A factual biography was attempted by DeWitt C. Peters in 1859, but has been criticized for inaccuracies and exaggerations. Carson became the hero of juvenile fiction not just in the United States, but also published in French, German, Portuguese, Gujarati, Hindi, Singhalese, Arabic and Japanese.\n\nThe first story about Carson's adventures was printed in 1847. It was called \"An Adventure of Kit Carson: A Tale of the Sacramento\". It was printed in \"Holden's Dollar Magazine\". Other stories were also printed, such as \"Kit Carson: The Prince of the Goldhunters\" and \"The Prairie Flower\". Writers thought Carson the perfect mountain man and Indian fighter. His exciting adventures were printed in the story \"Kiowa Charley, The White Mustanger; or, Rocky Mountain Kit's Last Scalp Hunt\". In this story, an older Kit is said to have \"ridden into Sioux camps unattended and alone, had ridden out again, but with the scalps of their greatest warriors at his belt.\"\n\nIn 1849, Carson guided soldiers on the trail of Mrs. Ann White and her baby daughter. They had been captured by Apaches. No one paid attention to Carson's advice about a rescue attempt, and Mrs. White was found dead with an arrow in her heart. She had been horribly abused, and may have been raped. Her child had been carried away, and was never found.\n\nA soldier in the rescue party wrote: \"Mrs. White was a frail, delicate, and very beautiful woman, but having undergone such usage as she suffered nothing but a wreck remained; it was literally covered with blows and scratches. Her countenance even after death indicated a hopeless creature. Over her corpse, we swore vengeance upon her persecutors.\"\n\nCarson discovered a book about himself in the Apache camp. This was the first time that he found himself in print. He was the hero of adventure stories. He was sorry for the rest of his life that Mrs. White had been killed. He wrote in his \"Memoirs\": \"In camp was found a book, the first of the kind I had ever seen, in which I was made a great hero, slaying Indians by the hundreds ... I have often thought that Mrs. White read the same ... [and prayed] for my appearance that she might be saved.\"\n\nIn 1856, Carson told his life story to someone who wrote it down. This book is called \"Memoirs\". The manuscript was lost when taken East to find a professional writer who would work it into a book. Washington Irving was asked, but declined. The lost manuscript was found in a trunk in Paris in 1905. It was later printed. The first biography of Carson was written by DeWitt C. Peters in 1859. The book was called \"Kit Carson, the Nestor of the Mountains, from Facts Narrated by Himself\". When the book was read to Carson he said, \"Peters laid it on a leetle too thick.\"\n\nLasting from 1846 to 1848, the Mexican–American War was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico. At war's end, Mexico was forced to sell the territories of Alta California and New Mexico to the United States under The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.\n\nOne of Carson's best known adventures took place during this war. In December 1846, Carson was ordered by General Stephen W. Kearny to guide him and his troops from Socorro, New Mexico to San Diego, California. Mexican soldiers attacked Kearny and his men near the village of San Pasqual, California.\n\nKearny was outnumbered. He knew he could not win; he ordered his men to take cover on a small hill. On the night of December 8, Carson, a naval lieutenant named Beale, and an Indian scout left Kearny to bring reinforcements from San Diego, away. Carson and the lieutenant removed their shoes because they made too much noise, and walked barefoot through the desert. Carson wrote in his \"Memoirs\": \"Finally got through, but had the misfortune to lose our shoes. Had to travel over a country covered with prickly pear and rocks, barefoot.\"\n\nBy December 10, Kearny believed reinforcements would not arrive. He planned to break through the Mexican lines the next morning, but 200 mounted American soldiers arrived in San Pasqual late that night. They swept the area, driving the Mexicans away. Kearny was in San Diego on December 12.\n\nIn April 1861, the American Civil War broke out. Carson left his job as an Indian agent and joined the Union Army as a lieutenant. He led the 1st New Mexico Volunteer Infantry and trained the new men. In October 1861, he was made a colonel. The Volunteers fought the Confederate forces in the Battle of Valverde in New Mexico, in February 1862. The Confederates won this battle but were later defeated in June and retreated to Texas.\n\nOnce the Confederates were driven from New Mexico, Carson's commander Major General James Henry Carleton turned his attention to the Native Americans. Author and historian Edwin Sabin writes that this officer had a \"psychopathic hatred of the Apaches\". Carleton led his forces deep into the Mescalero Apache territory. The Mescaleros were tired of fighting and put themselves under Carson's protection. Carleton put these Apaches on a remote and lonely reservation on the Pecos River.\n\nCarson disliked the Apaches as well. He wrote in a report that the Jicarilla Apaches \"were truly the most degraded and troublesome Indians we have in our department ... [W]e daily witness them in a state of intoxication in our plaza.\" Carson half-heartedly supported Carleton's plans. He was tired and had suffered an injury two years before that gave him great trouble. He resigned from the Army in February 1863. Carleton refused to accept the resignation because he wanted Carson to lead a campaign against the Navajo.\n\nCarleton had chosen a bleak site on the Pecos River for his reservation, which was called Bosque Redondo (Round Grove). He chose this site for the Apaches and Navajos because it was far from white settlements. He also wanted these Apaches and Navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from Kiowas and Comanches to the east of Bosque Redondo. He thought as well that the remoteness and desolation of the reservation would discourage white settlement.\n\nThe Mescalero Apaches walked to the reservation. By March 1863, four hundred Apaches had settled around nearby Fort Sumner. Others had fled west to join fugitive bands of Apaches. By middle summer, many of these people were planting crops and doing other farm work.\n\nOn July 7, Carson, with little heart for the Navajo roundup, started the campaign against the tribe. His orders were almost the same as those for the Apache roundup: he was to shoot all males on sight and take the women and children captives. No peace treaties were to be made until all the Navajo were on the reservation.\n\nCarson searched far and wide for the Navajo. He found their homes, fields, animals, and orchards, but the Navajo were experts at disappearing quickly and hiding in their vast lands. The roundup proved frustrating for Carson. He was in his 50s, tired, and ill. By autumn 1863, Carson started to burn the Navajo homes and fields and remove their animals from the area. The Navajo would starve if this destruction continued. One hundred eighty-eight Navajo surrendered and were sent to Bosque Redondo. Life at the Bosque had turned grim; murders took place. The Apaches and Navajos fought. The water in the Pecos contained minerals that gave people cramps and stomach aches. Residents had to walk to find firewood.\n\nCarson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign. Major General Carleton refused, ordering him to invade the Canyon de Chelly, where many Navajos had taken refuge. Historian David Roberts writes, \"Carson's sweep through the Canyon de Chelly in the winter of 1863–1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the Campaign.\"\n\nThe Canyon de Chelly was a sacred place for the Navajo. They believed that it would now be their strongest sanctuary. Three hundred Navajo took refuge on the canyon rim at a place called Fortress Rock. They resisted Carson's invasion by building rope ladders and bridges, lowering water pots into a stream, and keeping quiet and out of sight. These three hundred Navajo survived the invasion. In January 1864, Carson swept through the Canyon with his forces. The thousands of peach trees in the canyon were cut down. Few Navajo were killed or captured. Carson's invasion, however, proved to the Navajo that the United States could invade their country at any time. Many Navajo surrendered at Fort Canby.\n\nBy March 1864, there were 3,000 refugees at Fort Canby. An additional 5,000 arrived in the camp. They were suffering from the intense cold and hunger. Carson asked for supplies to feed and clothe them. The thousands of Navajo were led to Bosque Redondo. Many died along the way. Stragglers in the rear were shot and killed. In Navajo history, this horrific trek is known as Long Walk of the Navajo. By 1866, reports indicated that Bosque Redondo was a complete failure, and Major General Carleton was fired. Congress started investigations. In 1868, a treaty was signed, and the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland. Bosque Redondo was closed.\n\nOn November 25, 1864, Carson led his forces against the southwestern tribes at the First Battle of Adobe Walls in the Texas panhandle. Adobe Walls was an abandoned trading post blown up by its inhabitants to prevent a take-over by hostile Indians. Combatants at the First Battle were the United States Army and Indian scouts against Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches. It was one of the largest engagements fought on the Great Plains.\n\nThe battle was the result of General Carleton's belief that Indians were responsible for the continuing attacks on settlers along the Santa Fe Trail. He wanted to punish them and brought in Carson to do the job. With most of the Army engaged elsewhere during the American Civil War, the protection the settlers sought was almost nonexistent. Carson led 260 cavalry, 75 infantry, and 72 Ute and Jicarilla Apache Army scouts. In addition, he had two mountain howitzer cannons.\n\nOn the morning of November 25, Carson discovered and attacked a Kiowa village of 176 lodges. After destroying this village, he moved forward to Adobe Walls. Carson found other Comanche villages in the area, and realized he would face a very large force of Native Americans. A Captain Pettis estimated that 1,200 to 1,400 Comanche and Kiowa began to assemble. That number would swell, according to some accounts, to an implausible 3,000. Four to five hours of battle ensued. When Carson ran low on ammunition and howitzer shells, he ordered his men to retreat to a nearby Kiowa village. There they burned the village and many fine buffalo robes. His Indian scouts killed and mutilated four elderly and weak Kiowas.\n\nThe retreat to New Mexico was then begun. There were few deaths among Carson's men. General Carleton wrote to Carson: \"This brilliant affair adds another green leaf to the laurel wreath which you have so nobly won in the service of your country.\" \n\nIn 1847, General William Tecumseh Sherman met Kit Carson in Monterey, California. Sherman wrote: \"His fame was then at its height, ... and I was very anxious to see a man who had achieved such feats of daring among the wild animals of the Rocky Mountains, and still wilder Indians of the plains ... I cannot express my surprise at beholding such a small, stoop-shouldered man, with reddish hair, freckled face, soft blue eyes, and nothing to indicate extraordinary courage or daring. He spoke but little and answered questions in monosyllables.\"\n\nColonel Edward W. Wynkoop wrote: \"Kit Carson was five feet five and one half-inches tall, weighed about 140 pounds, of nervy, iron temperament, squarely built, slightly bow-legged, and those members apparently too short for his body. But, his head and face made up for all the imperfections of the rest of his person. His head was large and well-shaped with yellow straight hair, worn long, falling on his shoulders. His face was fair and smooth as a woman's with high cheekbones, straight nose, a mouth with a firm, but somewhat sad expression, a keen, deep-set but beautiful, mild blue eye, which could become terrible under some circumstances, and like the warning of the rattlesnake, gave notice of attack. Though quick-sighted, he was slow and soft of speech, and posed great natural modesty.\"\n\nLieutenant George Douglas Brewerton made one coast-to-coast dispatch-carrying trip to Washington, D.C. with Carson. Brewerton wrote: \"The Kit Carson of my \"imagination\" was over six feet high — a sort of modern Hercules in his build — with an enormous beard, and a voice like a roused lion ... The real Kit Carson I found to be a plain, simple ... man; rather below the medium height, with brown, curling hair, little or no beard, and a voice as soft and gentle as a woman's. In fact, the hero of a hundred desperate encounters, whose life had been mostly spent amid wilderness, where the white man is almost unknown, was one of Dame Nature's gentleman ...\"\n\nCarson joined Freemasonry in the Santa Fe Territory of New Mexico petitioning in Montezuma Lodge No. 101. He was initiated an Entered Apprentice on April 22, 1854, passed to the degree of Fellowcraft June 17, 1854, and raised to the sublime degree of Master Mason December 26, 1854, just two days after his forty-fifth birthday. Kit, together with several other Freemasons in Taos, petitioned to Charter Bent Lodge No. 204 (now Bent Lodge # 42) from the Grand Lodge of Missouri AF&AM, a request which was granted on June 1, 1860, with Kit elected Junior Warden of the lodge.\n\nThe Masonic fraternity continued to serve him and his family, well after his death. In 1908, the Grand Lodge of New Mexico erected a wrought iron fence around his family burial plot. The following year, the Grand Lodge challenged Bent Lodge to purchase and preserve Kit's home. More than a century later, the Kit Carson Home & Museum is still managed by the lodge today.\n\nCarson was married three times. His first two wives were Native American. His third wife was Mexican. Carson was the father of ten children. He never wrote about his first two marriages in his \"Memoirs\". He may have thought he would be known as a \"squaw man\". Such men were not welcomed by polite society.\n\nIn 1836, Carson met an Arapaho woman named Waanibe (Singing Grass, or Grass Singing) at a mountain man rendezvous held along the Green River in Wyoming. Singing Grass was a lovely young woman, and many mountain men were in love with her. Carson was forced to fight a duel with a French trapper named Chouinard for Waanibe's hand in marriage. Carson won, but he had a very narrow escape. The French trapper's bullet singed his hair. The duel was one of the best known stories about Carson in the 19th century.\n\nCarson married Singing Grass. She tended to his needs, and went with him on his trapping trips. They had a daughter named Adaline (or Adeline). Singing Grass died after giving birth to Carson's second daughter, in about 1841. This second child did not live long: in 1843, she fell into a kettle of boiling soap in Taos, New Mexico.\n\nCarson's life as a mountain man was too hard for a little girl so he took Adaline to live with his sister Mary Ann Carson Rubey in St. Louis, Missouri. Adaline was taught in a school for girls called a seminary. Carson brought her West when she was a teenager. She married a George Stilts of St. Louis, and divorced. In 1858, she went to the California goldfields. Adaline died in 1860 or after 1862, probably in Mono County, California.\n\nIn 1841, Carson married a Cheyenne woman named Making-Out-Road. They were together only a short time. Making-Out-Road divorced him in the way of her people by putting Adaline and all of Carson's property outside their tent. Making-Out-Road left Carson to travel with her people through the west.\n\nAbout 1842, Carson met Josefa Jaramillo. She was the daughter of a wealthy and prominent Mexican couple living in Taos. In order to marry her, Carson left the Presbyterian Church for the Catholic Church. He married 14-year-old Josefa on February 6, 1843. They had eight children.\n\nCarson was illiterate. He was embarrassed by this, and tried to hide it. In 1856, he dictated his \"Memoirs\" to another and stated then:\n\"I was a young boy in the school house when the cry came, Injuns! I jumped to my rifle and threw down my spelling book, and thar it lies.\"\n\nCarson enjoyed having other people read to him, and preferred the poetry of George Gordon, Lord Byron. Carson thought Sir Walter Scott's long poem, \"The Lady of the Lake\" was \"the finest expression of outdoor life.\" Carson eventually learned to write \"C. Carson\", but it was very difficult for him. He made his mark on official papers, and this mark was then witnessed by a clerk or other official.\n\nWhen the Civil War ended, and the Indian Wars campaigns were in a lull, Carson was appointed brevet brigadier general (dated March 13, 1865) and appointed commandant of Ft. Garland, Colorado, in the heart of Ute country. Carson had many Ute friends in the area and assisted in government relations.\n\nAfter being mustered out of the Army, Carson took up ranching, settling at Boggsville in Bent County. In 1868, at the urging of Washington and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Carson journeyed to Washington D.C., where he escorted several Ute Chiefs to meet with the President of the United States to plead for assistance to their tribe.\n\nSoon after his return, his wife Josefa died from complications after giving birth to their eighth child. Her death was a crushing blow to Carson. He died a month later at age 58 on May 23, 1868, in the presence of Dr. Tilton and his friend Thomas Boggs in the surgeon's quarters at Fort Lyon, Colorado. His last words were \"Goodbye, friends. \"Adios, compadres\"\". The cause of his death was abdominal aortic aneurysm. His resting place is Taos, New Mexico.\n\nCarson's home in Taos, New Mexico is today a museum called the Kit Carson Home and Museum. A monument was raised in the plaza at Santa Fe by the New Mexico Grand Army. In Denver, a statue of a mounted Kit Carson can be found atop the Mac Monnies Pioneer Monument. Another equestrian statue can be seen in Trinidad, Colorado. Carson National Forest in New Mexico was named for him, as well as a county and a town in Colorado. A river in Nevada is named for Carson as well as the state's capital, Carson City. Fort Carson, an army training post near Colorado Springs, was named for him during World War II by popular vote of the men training there. Kit Carson Park in Escondido, California is named for him.\n\nCarson has been widely depicted in film and television series. In 1966, the actor Phillip Pine played Carson with Michael Pate as fellow Fremont scout Frenchy Godey in the episode \"Samaritans, Mountain Style\" of the syndicated series, \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Robert Taylor. In the story line, Carson and Godey stop to help a settler in dire straits.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Carson came under the scrutiny of contemporary historians, and ideas regarding his historical legacy began to change. Earlier accounts portrayed Carson as an American hero, but in scholarship of this period he became an arch-villain in the military campaigns against the Indians. In 1992, for example, a young professor at Colorado College was successful in demanding that a period photograph of Carson be removed from the ROTC office. In 1992, a tourist told a journalist at the Carson home in Taos, \"I will not go into the home of that racist, genocidal killer.\" In the 1970s, a Navajo at a trading post said, \"No one here will talk about Kit Carson. He was a butcher.\" In 1993, a symposium was organized to air various views on Carson, but the Navajo spokespeople refused to attend.\n\nOver time, historical analysis of Carson shifted again. David Roberts writes, \"Carson's trajectory, over three and a half decades, from thoughtless killer of Apaches and Blackfeet to defender and champion of the Utes, marks him out as one of the few frontiersmen whose change of heart toward the Indians, born not of missionary theory but of first hand experience, can serve as an exemplar for the more enlightened policies that sporadically gained the day in the twentieth century.\"\n\nHarry Carey played Carson in the 1936 film \"Sutter's Gold\".\n\nJon Hall played Carson in the 1940 Western film \"Kit Carson\".\n\nRip Torn played Carson in the 1986 miniseries \"Dream West\".\n\nCarson was the inspiration for a same named character in the popular Italian comic book series \"Tex Willer\".\n\nCarson's contributions to western history have been reexamined by historians, journalists and Indian activists since the 1960s. In 1968, Carson biographer Harvey L. Carter stated:\n\nSome journalists and authors during the last 25 years presented an alternative view of Kit Carson. For instance, Virginia Hopkins stated in 1988 that \"Kit Carson was directly or indirectly responsible for the deaths of thousands of Indians\".\n\nHistorian Hampton Sides said that Carson believed the Native Americans needed reservations as a way of physically separating and shielding them from white hostility and white culture. He is said to have viewed the raids on white settlements as driven by desperation, \"committed from absolute necessity when in a starving condition.\" Indian hunting grounds were disappearing as waves of white settlers filled the region.\n\nIn 2014 there was a petition to rename Kit Carson Park in Taos, NM Red Willow Park. Despite the support of the Taos Pueblo and the residents of Taos Valley the park was not renamed and still bears the Kit Carson moniker.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "55718709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55718709", "title": "Letters of Charles Dickens", "text": "Letters of Charles Dickens\n\nThe letters of Charles Dickens, of which more than 14,000 are known, range in date from about 1821, when Dickens was 9 years old, to 8 June 1870, the day before he died. They have been described as \"invariably idiosyncratic, exuberant, vivid, and amusing…widely recognized as a significant body of work in themselves, part of the Dickens canon\". They were written to family, friends, and the contributors to his literary periodicals, who included many of the leading writers of the day. Their letters to him were almost all burned by Dickens because of his horror at the thought of his private correspondence being laid open to public scrutiny. The reference edition of Dickens's letters is the 12-volume Pilgrim Edition, edited by Graham Storey \"et al.\" and published by Oxford University Press.\n\nDickens received, by his own count, 60 to 80 letters every day, and when pressure of work permitted he replied to them without delay. For most of his life he did not employ a secretary but conducted his correspondence himself. Exceptions were made for begging letters, which his sister-in-law Georgina Hogarth answered, and for routine business connected with his two magazines, \"Household Words\" and \"All the Year Round\", which was handled by his assistant editor W. H. Wills, although Dickens preferred to correspond with the contributors himself. He wrote with a goose quill rather than a steel pen, and at first used black ink (now aged to brown), switching in the late 1840s to blue ink on blue paper. His biographer Fitzgerald described his handwriting as \"so 'prompt', so alert, finished and full of purpose and decision; legible also, but requiring familiarity and training to read\". He often ended his signature with an exuberant flourish, which became a kind of trademark.\n\nDickens's correspondents spanned the whole social scale of 19th century England from reformed street prostitutes to Queen Victoria herself. They included family members, of course, and Dickens's publishers; writers like Robert Browning, Thomas Carlyle, Wilkie Collins, George Eliot, John Forster, Alfred Tennyson (not yet ennobled), and William Makepeace Thackeray; the artists Clarkson Stanfield and Daniel Maclise; and the actor William Macready. Letters to several of his friends have little or no representation in the surviving correspondence because they were destroyed by the recipients, their heirs, or by random accidents of history. These correspondents include his daughter Katey, Augustus Egg, Chauncy Hare Townshend, Hablot K. Browne (\"Phiz\"), Richard Barham, James Muspratt, and his lover Ellen Ternan.\n\nThe letters are the only extended autobiographical writing by Dickens that has survived. Attempts at writing a diary seldom lasted long and for the most part the manuscripts are lost, while a memoir of his childhood was discontinued and converted into some of the early chapters of \"David Copperfield\". The letters therefore give the most immediate and vivid expression of Dickens's life as seen by himself, even though they rarely examine his interior life. They give a unique insight into the way Dickens's processes of composition worked as he wrestled with the novels we know and considered others which were never written, such as the \"book whereof the whole story shall be on the top of the Great St. Bernard\". Dickens's almost constant travelling is also reflected. George Gissing wrote that \"If he makes a tour in any part of the British Isles, he writes a full description of all he sees, of everything that happens, and writes it with such gusto, such mirth, such strokes of fine picturing, as appear in no other private letters ever given to the public.\" The range of subject-matter of the letters is described by his editor, Jenny Hartley:\n\nScotland, Paris, and Venice…child exploitation, Ragged Schools, and soup kitchens…the Great Exhibition, women smoking, and dresses for reformed prostitutes…ravens, waistcoats, and recipes for punch…mesmerism and dreams…terrible acting and wonderful children's birthday parties\".\n\nDickens's early sensational success as the author of \"The Pickwick Papers\" induced many people to keep any letters he might send them. This, along with his huge output of letters, ensured that many thousands have survived. In 1965 the editors of his letters reckoned them to number nearly 12,000; by 2002 they had amended the total to 14,252. Though some letters are in private hands, most are now in libraries and public institutions. The largest collection is held by the Charles Dickens Museum in London, the second largest by the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the third largest by the Morgan Library & Museum in New York; other extensive collections are held by the British Library, the New York Public Library, the Huntington Library, and the Free Library of Philadelphia.\n\nIn contrast, few letters to Dickens are known. Dickens often expressed his opposition to the publication of private letters, and was determined to suffer from it himself as little as possible. He burned those letters that had been sent to him in a mass bonfire in 1860, commenting, \"Would to God that every letter I had ever written was on that pile\". He burned more in 1869, the year before he died. As a result, hardly more than 250 letters to Dickens have survived to the present day.\n\nThe reading public's first chance to study large numbers of Dickens letters came shortly after his death with the publication of \"The Life of Charles Dickens\" (1872–74) by his lifelong friend John Forster. Many of Dickens's letters to Forster were included, but they were heavily and rather dishonestly edited to make Forster seem a more central figure in Dickens's life than he had always been.\n\nIn 1878 it was announced that a collection of Dickens's letters would be edited by his sister-in-law, Georgina Hogarth. In collaboration with Dickens's eldest daughter Mary she duly produced \"The Letters of Charles Dickens\" in three volumes, which were published by Chapman & Hall between 1880 and 1882. A second edition in two volumes followed in 1882, and a third in one volume, published by Macmillan, in 1893. Altogether they included roughly a thousand letters, many were heavily cut for reasons of taste, and some were created by cut-and-pasting together extracts from several different letters in a way which was considered unacceptable even by late-Victorian standards.\n\n1938 saw the publication in three volumes of almost 6,000 of the letters, edited by Walter Dexter as part of the Nonesuch Edition of Dickens's Works. This was an expensively-priced edition limited to 877 copies, and was therefore not easily accessible to the ordinary reader unless he had either ample means or access to a university library. Moreover, Dexter's editorial practices were far from rigorous: there was hardly any annotation, and many of the letters were simply copied from previous editions rather than from the originals, with the inevitable result that the texts were not always accurate.\n\nIn 1949 the publisher Rupert Hart-Davis set a new edition in motion, with a grant of £6000 from the Pilgrim Trust and the Dickens scholar Humphry House in place as editor. In 1955, with almost 10,000 letters transcribed, House died unexpectedly. His widow Madeline House took over the project in collaboration with the critic Graham Hough, though Graham Storey soon took over Hough's role. The first volume of the Pilgrim Trust Edition, as it was named, was eventually published by Oxford University Press under their Clarendon Press imprint in 1965, and 11 more volumes appeared periodically, the last one in 2002. The editorial team changed over the years, with Madeline House, Graham Storey, Kathleen Tillotson, K. J. Fielding, Nina Burgis and Angus Easson all being named as editor at various points. The British Academy took over the financing of the project, and from 1995 it was renamed the British Academy – Pilgrim Trust Edition. An electronic version of the edition has been published by InteLex Past Masters. The Pilgrim Edition includes some 14,000 letters addressed to 2,500 known correspondents and to more than 200 unnamed and unidentifiable ones. Not all of the originals of these letters can be found; some are printed from short extracts in sale catalogues and similar sources, and some are only known from mentions of their existence in other letters. Dickens's biographer Claire Tomalin reported that \"Each volume of this edition wins acclaim as it appears, and it is right that it should do so\"; one such critic thought that \"it brings Dickens so close you can almost smell the cigar smoke\". Dissenting voices have been few, and though Joel J. Brattin noted that there were some errors and omissions of transcription he endorsed it as being in general extremely accurate, and thought the project as a whole \"of incomparable value\".\n\nNew Dickens letters are discovered at the rate of about 20 per year, and they were for some years edited and published in Supplements to the Pilgrim Edition in \"The Dickensian\", the journal of the Dickens Fellowship. They have also been made accessible online by the Charles Dickens Letters Project, and it is intended eventually to publish a supplementary volume to the Pilgrim Edition.\n\nThe costliness of both the Nonesuch and Pilgrim volumes, and the fragmentary or routine business nature of many of the letters included, has encouraged the publication of selections of Dickens's letters, intended for the general reader rather than the scholar. In 1985 David Paroissien edited \"The Selected Letters of Charles Dickens\", taking his texts from the Nonesuch Edition, substantive textual variants from the first five volumes of the Pilgrim Edition (the only ones then published) being listed in the notes. The scholar John Espey wrote that this selection constitutes \"a full review of almost all that we know of Dickens' activities as editor, public figure, father, husband, lecturer and lover\", and that it \"should satisfy for some time both the general reader and the specialist\".\n\nIn 2012, Dickens's bicentenary year, Jenny Hartley edited a one-volume selection from the Pilgrim Edition. Claire Harman, writing in the \"Times Literary Supplement\", welcomed it with enthusiasm, while noting the sparse annotation and the fact that Hartley had chosen a representative selection of the letters, including a few rather trivial ones, rather than \"a series of epistolary knock-out blows\". Boyd Tonkin, in the \"Independent\", found it to be \"edited with unobtrusive intelligence and insight\", Joyce Carol Oates thought it \"more revealing and more intimate than any biography\", and the critic Nicholas Lezard recommended it in the \"Guardian\" with the words, \"The whole book bursts with the author’s energy, and you will love him and know him better after reading even a few of these letters.\"\n\nAlso in 2012, a 4-hour audiobook was issued by Naxos under the title \"Charles Dickens: A Portrait in Letters\", the readers being David Timson and Simon Callow. One reviewer wrote that they \"create myriad personalities with varying accents, tones, class distinctions, and personal idiosyncrasies that are nearly flawless\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51366526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51366526", "title": "Lochtegate", "text": "Lochtegate\n\nLochtegate is a name of a scandal involving United States swim team members Ryan Lochte, Jimmy Feigen, Gunnar Bentz, and Jack Conger during the 2016 Summer Olympics held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. While initial news stories reported that Lochte and three other US swimmers had been robbed at gunpoint after a night out in Rio, later details emerged that the \"armed robbers posing as police\" were actually security guards at a gas station where the swimmers had urinated outside the bathroom and Lochte vandalized a framed poster, and ended with the swimmers providing money to the guards. Some of the swimmers were detained in Brazil as witnesses. Two of the swimmers told police that Lochte's story had been fabricated.\n\nUltimately, the athletes each released statements, and one swimmer paid a fine of approximately $10,800 to a Brazilian charity in order to get his passport back. Lochte apologized for lying about the gas station dispute, and for overshadowing the ongoing Olympic games. Three days later, Lochte lost all four of his commercial sponsors.\n\nLochte was charged in Brazil with falsely reporting a crime. The scandal gained significant media attention and \"embarrassed the host city, angered the police and government and dominated news coverage of South America's first Olympics.\" In July 2017 the court in Brazil dismissed the charges against Lochte, because his false claims were \"made to a broadcaster and not to police.\"\n\nOn the morning of August 14, 2016, Ryan Lochte and Jimmy Feigen claimed that they and teammates Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger were robbed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the 2016 Summer Olympics after armed men showing a \"police badge\" allegedly forced them out of their taxi at gunpoint in the early morning hours. The story was initially publicized that day after a chance encounter between Lochte's mother, Ileana Lochte, and Fox Sports Australia presenter Ben Way. Way tweeted that \"Ryan Lochte has been held up at gunpoint,\" which resulted in a prompt denial from International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams that the report was \"absolutely not true.\" The next day, Lochte claimed in an interview with Billy Bush on the \"Today Show\" that the men who stopped their taxi had a police badge, and that one of the men cocked his gun and put it up against Lochte's forehead. Rio Olympics spokesman Mario Andrada stated, \"We regret the violence has got so close to the athletes.\"\n\nLochte returned to the United States on August 15. On August 17, police went to the Olympic Village to secure Lochte and Feigen's passports \"in order to secure further testimony from the athletes.\" On August 18, Lochte's attorney Jeff Ostrow said that before he left Brazil, Lochte \"sat for a victim interview with the Brazilian Tourist Police, USOC Security, State Department, FBI, and anyone else that the Brazilian authorities requested to be present.\"\n\nOn the evening of August 17, Conger and Bentz were removed from a flight while attempting to leave the country and their passports were seized in order to compel testimony about the incident. A judge in Brazil also issued a search and seizure warrant for Lochte and Feigen; Feigen subsequently contacted the authorities, and said he would make a public statement when the matter was settled. Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro concluded that the athletes were not robbed, but instead had been involved in an incident at a gas station in Barra da Tijuca, west of the city. According to statements by the owner on August 18, they broke a soap dispenser in the bathroom, damaged a door, tore down a sign and urinated around the premises. This investigation found that the swimmers stopped at a gas station near Casa França, where security guards detained the swimmers for vandalism perpetrated in a bathroom while intoxicated. Rio's police chief Fernando Veloso stated that the swimmers handed over 100 reais ($31) and $20 in U.S. currency as compensation for objects damaged in the bathroom, such as a soap holder, a mirror, and a \"Please Do Not Enter\" sign.\n\nAccording to anonymous police sources, Conger and Bentz at first told the police Lochte's story was fabricated. The Associated Press reported that Conger and Bentz \"refuted Lochte’s claim that the group was held up by armed assailants\". Gunnar Bentz stated that two guns were drawn, while Fernando Deluz, who helped translate conversations between the swimmers and armed security guards at the gas station, stated a gun was involved in the incident, but was not pointed at the swimmers. On the morning of August 18, upon his return to America, Feigen reiterated in an interview that \"We were robbed at gunpoint.\" That same day, police recommended Lochte face charges for falsely reporting a crime. On August 19, Lochte hired public relations consultant Matthew Hiltzik and posted an apology on Instagram for his behavior.\n\nOn August 25, 2016, Lochte was charged by Rio police with falsely reporting a crime, with other officials stating he would be summoned to Rio. Lochte can be represented by a lawyer and is not required to appear in court. A conviction could result in one to six months in jail, with the judge allowed to levy a fine instead. Lochte would also have the ability to appeal any decision. The next day, Lochte's lawyer stated there would be no response to the charge of making a false statement which would create the possibility of Lochte being tried in absentia.\n\nOn August 23, \"USA Today\" released an on-site investigation at the gas station that \"raised questions about Rio cops\" and \"supports Lochte's later account in which he said he thought the swimmers were being robbed.\" The \"USA Today\" report quoted a Brazilian judge who said police might have been hasty in determining the security guards did not commit a robbery, and a Brazilian lawyer \"says she does not think the actions of Lochte and teammate Jimmy Feigen constitute the filing of a false police report as defined under Brazilian law\". On August 30, Lochte appeared on ABC's TV morning show \"Good Morning America\" and doubled down on his insistence that the Rio police version of events is \"absurd\" and said:\n\n\"USA TODAY and other people have been finding out and investigating...There was no damage to the bathroom. I have never even entered the bathroom. It was locked, so we couldn't go in there at all. The story about me vandalising the bathroom is absurd. It never happened.\"\n\nOn August 24, 2016, CBS News also questioned the accuracy of Brazil's version of events and cited the report by \"USA Today\" Sports, in line with their findings.\n\nLochte made a television appearance on August 20, 2016, in which he continued to deny the premises of the situation, while apologizing for his \"immature\" decisions and behavior. \"PRWeek\" noted that many found the statement to be lacking, with \"Forbes\" noting possible legal exposure. Lochte later admitted he was drunk and that his claims were \"over-exaggerated\".\n\nOn August 26, when asked about whether the US would consider a request from Brazil to extradite Lochte, White house press secretary Josh Earnest replied \"the United States will certainly adhere to the terms of any extradition treaty that we’ve signed with any country in the world. Obviously, as we’ve discussed in a very different context, we remain committed to following those guidelines assiduously, and allowing the guidelines of those treaties and the law here in the United States to guide those discussions and to guide those decisions. I can’t speak to the details of the charges that have been reportedly filed against Mr. Lochte, so for more details on that I think I’d refer you either to Brazilian authorities or to attorneys that have been retained by Mr. Lochte.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Good Morning America\" on August 30, 2016, Lochte said his claim of being held up at gunpoint was a \"very big mistake,\" but regarding the ensuing scandal, \"I think it's everyone blowing this way out of proportion. I think that's what happened.\" Regarding his claim that a gun was held to his head, he stated, \"Like I said, I did lie about that one part.\" and that it was made while still intoxicated the next day.\n\nLochte's attorney, Jeffrey M. Ostrow, stated that authorities in Rio should investigate the two security guards who pulled weapons on the U.S. swimmers, despite there being no video evidence that their weapons had been removed from their holsters. On August 30, 2016, Lochte refuted the Rio de Janeiro police's claims of vandalism by the swimmers, stating, \"USA TODAY and other people have been finding out and investigating,” and \"There was no damage to the bathroom. I have never even entered the bathroom. It was locked, so we couldn't go in there at all.\"\n\nFeigen issued a statement on August 24, 2016, after he was allowed to leave Brazil. The content of the statement began with \"I would like to apologize for the serious distractions from the Olympics...\" After giving his understanding of the facts of the case, he also said \"In this statement, I omitted the facts that we urinated behind the building and that Ryan Lochte pulled a poster off the wall. This statement was written by the officers in Portuguese, and I was then asked to sign the statement without seeing it translated into English. I realize that I made a mistake by omitting these facts. I was trying to protect my teammates and for this I apologize.\"\n\n\"USA Today\" reported that Feigen paid a fine and then left Brazil on August 19, 2016, after his passport was released. Feigen stated that he paid the fine of approximately $10,800 to a Brazilian charity in order to get his passport back. He also stated the court initially proposed a $31,250 fine and 15 days of community service. After he rejected the offer, the judge increased the amount to $46,875, but Feigen's attorney negotiated the final amount.\n\nOn the evening of August 17, Conger and Bentz were removed from a flight while attempting to leave the country and their passports were seized in order to compel testimony about the incident. A judge in Brazil also issued a search and seizure warrant for Lochte and Feigen; Feigen subsequently contacted the authorities, and said he would make a public statement when the matter was settled. Civil Police of Rio de Janeiro concluded that the athletes were not robbed, but instead had been involved in an incident at a gas station in Barra da Tijuca.\n\nAfter Bentz returned to the United States, he released a statement August 19 about the incident. He started by stating \"I want to offer a sincere apology to the United States Olympic Committee, USA Swimming, the extraordinary women and men of Team USA, and the University of Georgia.\" He continued with \"While I am anxious to put this matter behind me and rejoin my Georgia teammates in classes, practices and competitions, I feel compelled to stress several key points. 1. I was never a suspect in the case from the beginning (Brazilian law enforcement officials saw me only as a witness). 2. I never made a false statement to anyone at any time.\" He went on detailing the incident to include admitting to urinating behind the gas station, and that Lochte pulled down a framed metal advertisement.\n\nAfter Conger returned to the United States, he issued a statement on August 19, 2016, in which he stated \"Let me begin by emphasizing that I have been completely truthful in my statements throughout this unfortunate situation, including the information I provided to US officials before leaving Brazil. In fact, the Brazilian authorities made clear to me from the very beginning that I was being considered only a witness, not a suspect.\" He apologized by saying \"we pulled into a gas station to use the restroom, but ultimately relieved ourselves outside, for which I apologize.\"\n\nThe story, and the athletes' multiple versions of it, dominated Olympic headlines, and was described as \"overshadowing the worthy accomplishments of athletes who trained for years.\" NBC drew criticism for its handling of Lochte's account. On August 24, 2016, Lochte's attorney stated about the prior week, \"I’ve had every media outlet in the world reach out to me, the biggest news shows, the biggest talk shows.\"\n\nThe scandal drew social media mockery and then scorn, including commentary about white privilege and rude Americans. #Lochtegate became a trending topic on Twitter, alternatively dubbed as #LochMess, with the social media phenomenon drawing media coverage. with \"Time\" awarding the meme a silver medal.\n\nTalk show hosts Stephen Colbert parodied Lochte's \"Today Show\" interview and compared his behavior to Donald Trump, while Jimmy Fallon parodied Lochte at the MTV Video Music Awards with attendee Michael Phelps' joy \"noticeable from the start.\"\n\nIn Brazil, the events \"shocked and deeply angered Brazilians, who said it cast a false negative shadow on their city\" and was condemned for drawing additional attention to crime and violence in Rio de Janeiro. Some Brazilians drew parallels between the swimmers' actions and U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThe Shell gas station was incorporated into a commercial tour of Olympic sites, and reports an increase in paid customers and visitors taking selfies.\n\nFellow American swimmer Lilly King said, \"It’s sad that people aren’t focusing on how well the U.S. Olympic team did. This might have been the best team we've ever had.\" Swimmer Maya DiRado, who earned four medals said, \"We wish that that hadn't taken attention away from our week of swimming because it was a phenomenal week for Team U.S.A. and U.S. swimming, and it was a phenomenal week on week two for those athletes on track and field.\" Conor Dwyer added, \"It was tragic that the last week of the games that's all they're talking about and we don't want that to reflect poorly on U.S.A. swimming.\" Michael Phelps said, \"It's always hard to see a friend and competitor go through a hard time like this. I know what it feels like and I've been through it before.\"\n\nMarketers believed future professional and business opportunities for Gunnar Bentz, 20, and Jack Conger, 21, would be significantly reduced.\n\nMediaMiser reported Lochte's favorability rating changed from 90% positive on August 14–15 to 70% negative on August 17–18, with \"Forbes\" projecting a reduction of \"at least $5-10 million in future lifetime income\" due to damage to his personal brand.\n\nAfter Lochte's statements, Speedo and Ralph Lauren ended their endorsement deals with Lochte, with Speedo announcing that the company would donate $50,000 from Lochte's endorsement fee to Save the Children in Brazil. The Brazilian newspaper O Globo reported that other sponsors of Ryan Lochte, the Airweave and Syneron Candela also terminated their contracts. According to a commentator and sports business analyst for ESPN, Darren Rovell, Lochte will lose US$1 million. However, Lochte signed new endorsement deals with Pine Bros Softish Throat Drops with the campaign slogan \"Forgiving On Your Throat\" and Robocopp, a crime prevention company, which manufactures a \"sound grenade\" designed to deter would-be robbers. Pine Bros CEO Rider McDowell told Yahoo Finance there was a 20% sales increase in the week following the signing.\n\nHe also joined \"Dancing with the Stars\". During the live installment of the season premiere, two men wearing anti-Lochte T-shirts rushed the stage while Lochte was receiving his scores. They were tackled by security guards, then arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department and charged with suspicion of criminal trespassing.\n\nLochte stated his intent to participate in the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. On August 26, Lochte announced that he will be making a celebrity appearance at a Wizard World Comic Con in Richmond, VA in September 2016.\n\nOn August 18, U.S. Olympic Committee CEO Scott Blackmun apologized for the incident On August 19, the International Olympic Committee created a disciplinary commission for the four swimmers, to investigate the matter and potentially sanction the athletes. On August 21, Blackmun stated that further action would occur involving the four, without commenting on specific disciplinary actions.\n\nOn September 8, both the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Swimming suspended Lochte for 10 months and Bentz, Conger and Feigen for four months. Additionally, Lochte was required to complete 20 hours of community service and Bentz required to complete 10 hours. All were made ineligible for financial support during their suspensions, removed from the U.S. Olympic delegation to the White House, barred from U.S. Olympic training centers, and blocked from attending USA Swimming's year-end Golden Goggles celebration.\n\nLochte's lawyer, Jeff Ostrow, declined to comment on the appropriateness of the sanctions, and reiterated that \"Ryan did not commit a crime.\" Conger stated, \"I do not agree in any way with these sanctions,\" and maintained that all he did wrong was to urinate publicly at the gas station.\n\nBlackmun's statement noted, \"As we have said previously, the behavior of these athletes was not acceptable. It unfairly maligned our hosts and diverted attention away from the historic achievements of Team USA,\" and \"Each of the athletes has accepted responsibility for his actions and accepted the appropriate sanctions.\" Chuck Wielgus of USA Swimming stated, \"Unfortunately, this storyline took attention away from the athletes who deserved it the most\" and \"These [swimmers] took accountability for their mistakes and are committed to represent themselves and our country with the great character and distinction we expect.\"\n\nSeveral opinion writers criticised the contrasting consequences faced by Lochte to both women's goalkeeper Hope Solo, who was suspended for six months after making unsportsmanlike post-game comments, and American gymnast Gabby Douglas. An \"Associated Press\" columnist stated, \"A triumphant Olympics for the U.S. team—especially all those golden female athletes—has come with some nasty aftershocks, raising more potential questions about gender inequality.\" \"Salon\" criticized the general treatment of male athletes including past Olympians, while \"Variety\" noted the impact in which \"NBC wants to both showcase women athletes and attract female viewers.\"\n\nSeveral opinion pieces drew links to white privilege, while others refuted the charge. \"Ebony\" stated, \"Lochte's tale of being robbed by seemingly corrupt cops was not only in line with what many already believed about nations full of people of color, but it also tainted the spirit of the entire games.\" Leah Donella, a news assistant at NPR observed, \"Lochte's own background — he's half Cuban, another country with an extremely complex racial history — further complicates that narrative.\"\n\nSome negatively contrasted the treatment of the scandal involving white swimmers against the reaction received by African-American gymnast Gabby Douglas for not placing her hand over her heart during the national anthem.\n\nOther commentary compared the incident to political corruption, calling the exchange of money to drop criminal charges a \"shakedown.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "7907317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7907317", "title": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad", "text": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\n\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad ( , born Mahmoud Sabbaghian () on 28 October 1956) is an Iranian politician who was the sixth President of Iran from 2005 to 2013. He was also the main political leader of the Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran, a coalition of conservative political groups in the country.\n\nAn engineer and teacher from a poor background, ideologically shaped by thinkers such as Navvab Safavi, Jalal Al-e-Ahmad and Ahmad Fardid, Ahmadinejad joined the Office for Strengthening Unity after the Iranian Revolution. Appointed a provincial governor, he was removed after the election of President Mohammad Khatami and returned to teaching. Tehran's council elected him mayor in 2003. He took a religious hard line, reversing reforms of previous moderate mayors. His 2005 presidential campaign, supported by the Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran, garnered 62% of the runoff election votes, and he became President on 3 August 2005.\n\nDuring his presidency, Ahmadinejad was a controversial figure within Iran, as well as internationally. He has been criticized domestically for his economic policies and disregard for human rights. Internationally, he is criticized for his hostility towards some countries, most notably Saudi Arabia, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the United States and other Western and Arab nations. In 2007, Ahmadinejad introduced a gas rationing plan to reduce the country's fuel consumption, and cut the interest rates that private and public banking facilities could charge. He supports Iran's nuclear program. His election to a second term in 2009 was widely disputed and caused widespread protests domestically and drew significant international criticism.\n\nDuring his second term, Ahmadinejad came under fire not only from reformers but also traditionalists in parliament and the Revolutionary Guard, and even from Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, over accusations of corruption, Ahmadinejad's dismissal of Intelligence minister Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i, and his support for his controversial close adviser Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei. On 14 March 2012, Ahmadinejad became the first president of the Islamic Republic of Iran to be summoned by the Islamic Consultative Assembly (parliament) to answer questions regarding his presidency. Limited to two terms under the current Iranian constitution, Ahmadinejad supported Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei's campaign for president. On 15 June 2013, Hassan Rouhani was elected as Ahmadinejad's successor and assumed office on 3 August 2013.\n\nOn 12 April 2017, Ahmadinejad announced that he intended to run for a third term in the 2017 Iranian presidential election, against the objections of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei. His nomination was rejected by the Guardian Council. During the 2017–18 Iranian protests Ahmedinejad criticized the current government of Iran.\n\nMahmoud Ahmadinejad was born on 28 October 1956 near Garmsar, in the village of Aradan, in Semnan province. His mother, Khanom, was a Sayyida, an honorific title given to those believed to be direct bloodline descendants of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. His father, Ahmad, was a grocer and barber, and was a religious Shia who taught the Quran.\n\nWhen Mahmoud was one year old, his family moved to Tehran. Mahmoud's father changed their family name from \"Saborjhian\" or \"Sabaghian\" to Ahmadinejad in 1960 to avoid discrimination when the family moved to the city. \"Sabor\" is Persian for thread painter, a once common occupation within the Semnan carpet industry. Ahmadinejad's uncle and his brother Davoud Ahmadinejad have confirmed that the previous surname was \"Sabbaghian\" (). Ahmadinejad is a composite name: Ahmadi Nejad. Ahmad is to a name applied for Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, and namely virtuous. The suffix \"Nejad\" in Persian means race, therefore the term Ahmadi Nejad means \"the race of Muhammad\". According to the interviews with the relatives of Ahmadi Nejad, his father who works in small shop, sold his house in Tehran and bought a smaller one, giving the leftover to charity and poor people.\n\nIn 1976, Ahmadinejad took Iran's national university entrance examination. According to his autobiography, he was ranked 132nd out of 400,000 participants that year, and soon enrolled in the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST), located at Tehran, as an undergraduate student of civil engineering. He would later earn his doctorate in 1997 in transportation engineering and planning from Iran University of Science and Technology as well, when he was the mayor of Ardabil Province, located at the north-west of the country.\n\nSome details of Ahmadinejad's life during the 1980s are not publicly known, but it is known that he held a number of administrative posts in the province of West Azerbaijan, Iran.\n\nMany reports say that after Saddam Hussein ordered the invasion of Iran, Ahmadinejad joined the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and served in their intelligence and security apparatus, but his advisor Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi says, \"He has never been a member or an official member of the Revolutionary Guards\", having been a Basiji-like volunteer instead.\n\nAhmadinejad was accepted to a Master of Science program at his alma mater in 1986. He joined the faculty there as a lecturer in 1989, and in 1997 received his doctorate in civil engineering and traffic transportation planning.\n\nAfter the Islamic Revolution, Ahmadinejad became a member of the Office for Strengthening Unity, an organization developed to prevent students from sympathizing or allying with the budding Mojahedin-e Khalq.\n\nHe first took political office as unelected governor to both Maku and Khoy in West Azarbaijan Province during the 1980s. He eventually became an advisor to the governor general of Kurdistan Province for two years. During his doctoral studies at Tehran, he was appointed governor general of newly formed Ardabil Province from 1993 until Mohammad Khatami removed him in 1997, whereupon he returned to teaching.\n\nThe 2003 mayoral race in Tehran elected conservative candidates from the Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran to the City Council of Tehran. The Council appointed Ahmadinejad mayor.\n\nAs mayor, he reversed changes made by previous moderate and reformist mayors. He put religious emphasis on the activities of cultural centres they had founded, publicised the separation of elevators for men and women in the municipality offices, and suggested that people killed in the Iran–Iraq War be buried in major city squares of Tehran. He also worked to improve the traffic system and put an emphasis on charity, such as distributing free soup to the poor.\n\nAfter his election to the presidency, Ahmadinejad's resignation as the Mayor of Tehran was accepted on 28 June 2005. After two years as mayor, Ahmadinejad was one of 65 finalists for World Mayor in 2005, selected from 550 nominees, only nine of them from Asia. He was among three strong candidates for the top-ten list, but his resignation made him ineligible.\n\nAhmadinejad was not widely known when he entered the presidential election campaign as he had never run for office before, (he had been mayor of Tehran for only two years and had been appointed, not elected), although he had already made his mark in Tehran for rolling back earlier reforms. He was/is a member of the Central Council of the Islamic Society of Engineers, but his key political support is inside the Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran (\"Abadgaran\" or \"Developers\"). He was also helped by support from supreme leader Ali Khamenei, who some described Ahmadinejad as a \"protege\" of.\n\nAhmadinejad generally sent mixed signals about his plans for his presidency, perhaps to attract both religious conservatives and the lower economic classes. His campaign slogan was: \"It's possible and we can do it\".\n\nIn the campaign, he took a populist approach. He emphasized his own modest life, and compared himself with Mohammad Ali Rajai, Iran's second president. Ahmadinejad said he planned to create an \"exemplary government for the people of the world\" in Iran. He was a \"principlist\", acting politically based on Islamic and revolutionary principles. One of his goals was \"putting the petroleum income on people's tables\", meaning Iran's oil profits would be distributed among the poor.\n\nAhmadinejad was the only presidential candidate who spoke out against future relations with the United States. He told Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting the United Nations was \"one-sided, stacked against the world of Islam.\" He opposed the veto power of the UN Security Council's five permanent members: \"It is not just for a few states to sit and veto global approvals. Should such a privilege continue to exist, the Muslim world with a population of nearly 1.5 billion should be extended the same privilege.\" He defended Iran's nuclear program and accused \"a few arrogant powers\" of trying to limit Iran's industrial and technological development in this and other fields.\n\nIn his second-round campaign, he said, \"We didn't participate in the revolution for turn-by-turn government...This revolution tries to reach a world-wide government.\" He spoke of an extended program using trade to improve foreign relations, and called for greater ties with Iran's neighbours and ending visa requirements between states in the region, saying that \"people should visit anywhere they wish freely. People should have freedom in their pilgrimages and tours.\"\n\nAhmadinejad described Ayatollah Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi, a senior cleric from Qom, as his ideological and spiritual mentor. Mesbah founded the Haghani School of thought in Iran. He and his team strongly supported Ahmadinejad's 2005 presidential campaign.\n\nAhmadinejad won 62% of the vote in the run-off poll against Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei authorized his presidency on 3 August 2005. Ahmedinejad kissed Khamenei's hand during the ceremony to show his loyalty.\n\nShortly after Ahmadinejad was elected president, some western media outlets published claims that he was among the students who stormed the US embassy in Tehran, sparking the Iran hostage crisis. This claim has been denied by the Iranian government, the Iranian opposition, as well as a CIA investigation on the matter.\n\nIran's President is constitutionally obliged to obtain confirmation from the parliament for his selection of ministers. Ahmadinejad presented a short-list at a private meeting on 5 August, and his final list on 14 August. The Majlis rejected all of his cabinet candidates for the oil portfolio and objected to the appointment of his allies in senior government office. The Majlis approved a cabinet on 24 August. The ministers promised to meet frequently outside Tehran and held their first meeting on 25 August in Mashhad, with four empty seats for the unapproved nominees.\n\nAhmadinejad's team lost the 2006 city council elections. In the first nationwide election since Ahmadinejad became President, his allies failed to dominate election returns for the Assembly of Experts and local councils. Results, with a turnout of about 60%, suggested a voter shift toward more moderate policies. According to an editorial in the Kargozaran independent daily newspaper, \"The results show that voters have learned from the past and concluded that we need to support.. moderate figures.\" An Iranian political analyst said that \"this is a blow for Ahmadinejad and Mesbah Yazdi's list.\"\n\nOn 23 August 2008, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei announced that he \"sees Ahmadinejad as president in the next five years,\" a comment interpreted as indicating support for Ahmadinejad's reelection. 39,165,191 ballots were cast in the election on 12 June 2009, according to Iran's election headquarters. Ahmadinejad won 24,527,516 votes, (62.63%). In second place, Mir-Hossein Mousavi, won 13,216,411 (33.75%) of the votes.\n\nThe election results remained in dispute with both Mousavi and Ahmadinejad and their respective supporters who believe that electoral fraud occurred during the election. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei formally endorsed Ahmadinejad as President on 3 August 2009, and Ahmadinejad was sworn in for a second term on 5 August 2009. Iran's Constitution stipulates term limits of two terms for the office of President.\nSeveral Iranian political figures appeared to avoid the ceremony. Former presidents Mohammad Khatami, and Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who is currently head of the Expediency Discernment Council, along with opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, did not attend the ceremony. Opposition groups asked protesters on reformist websites and blogs to launch new street demonstrations on the day of the inauguration ceremony. On inauguration day, hundreds of riot police met opposition protesters outside parliament. After taking the oath of office, which was broadcast live on Iranian state television, Ahmadinejad said that he would \"protect the official faith, the system of the Islamic revolution and the constitution.\" France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States announced that they would not send the usual letters of congratulation.\n\nAhmadinejad announced controversial ministerial appointments for his second term. Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei was briefly appointed as first vice president, but opposed by a number of Majlis members and by the intelligence minister, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i. Mashaei followed orders to resign. Ahmadinejad then appointed Mashaei as chief of staff, and fired Mohseni-Eje'i.\n\nOn 26 July 2009, Ahmadinejad's government faced a legal problem after he sacked four ministers. Iran's constitution (Article 136) stipulates that, if more than half of its members are replaced, the cabinet may not meet or act before the Majlis approves the revised membership. The vice chairman of the Majlis announced that no cabinet meetings or decisions would be legal, pending such a re-approval.\n\nThe main list of 21 cabinet appointments was announced on 19 August 2009. On 4 September, the Majlis approved 18 of the 21 candidates, and rejected three, including two women. Sousan Keshavarz, Mohammad Aliabadi, and Fatemeh Ajorlou were not approved by Majlis for the Ministries of Education, Energy, and Welfare and Social Security, respectively. Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi was the first woman approved by the Majlis as a minister in the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\nAhmadinejad suffered a defeat in March/May 2012 parliamentary elections with Ayatollah Khamenei's \"Principalist\" allies winning about three quarters of the parliaments 290 seats, and Ahmadinejad supporters far fewer.\n\nIn Ahmadinejad's first four years as president, Iran's real GDP reflected growth of the economy. Inflation and unemployment also decreased under Ahmadinejad due to better economic management and ending the unsustainable spending and borrowing patterns of previous administrations . Ahmadinejad increased spending by 25% and supported subsidies for food and petrol. He also initially refused a gradual increase of petrol prices, saying that after making necessary preparations, such as a development of public transportation system, the government would free up petrol prices after five years. Interest rates were cut by presidential decree to below the inflation rate. One unintended effect of this stimulation of the economy has been the bidding up of some urban real estate prices by two or three times their pre-Ahmadinejad value by Iranians seeking to invest surplus cash and finding few other safe opportunities. The resulting increase in the cost of housing hurt poorer, non-property owning Iranians, the putative beneficiaries of Ahmadinejad's populist policies. The Management and Planning Organisation, a state body charged with mapping out long-term economic and budget strategy, was broken up and its experienced managers were fired.\nIn June 2006, 50 Iranian economists wrote a letter to Ahmadinejad that criticized his price interventions to stabilize prices of goods, cement, government services, and his decree issued by the High Labor Council and the Ministry of Labor that proposed an increase of workers' salaries by 40%. Ahmadinejad publicly responded harshly to the letter and denounced the accusations. Ahmadinejad called for \"middle-of-the-road\" compromises with respect to Western-oriented capitalism and socialism. Current political conflicts with the United States caused the central bank to fear increased capital flight due to global isolation. These factors prevented an improvement of infrastructure and capital influx, despite high economic potential. Among those that did not vote for him in the first election, only 3.5% said they would consider voting for him in the next election. Mohammad Khoshchehreh, a member of the Iranian parliament that campaigned for Ahmadinejad, said that his government \"has been strong on populist slogans, but weak on achievement.\"\n\nPresident Ahmadinejad changed almost all of his economic ministers, including oil, industry and economy, since coming to power in 2005. In an interview with Fars News Agency on April 2008, Davoud Danesh Jaafari who acted as minister of economy in Ahmadinejad's cabinet, harshly criticized his economic policy: \"During my time, there was no positive attitude towards previous experiences or experienced people and there was no plan for the future. Peripheral issues which were not of dire importance to the nation were given priority. Most of the scientific economic concepts like the effect of liquidity on inflation were put in question.\" In response to these criticisms, Ahmadinejad accused his minister of not being \"a man of justice\" and declared that the solution to Iran's economic problem is \"the culture of martyrdom\". In May 2008, the petroleum minister of Iran admitted that the government illegally invested 2 billion dollars to import petrol in 2007. At Iranian parliament, he also mentioned that he simply followed the president's order.\n\nWhile his government had 275 thousand billion toman oil income, the highest in Iranian history, Ahmadinejad's government had the highest budget deficit since the Iranian revolution.\n\nDuring his presidency, Ahmadinejad launched a gasoline rationing plan to reduce the country's fuel consumption. He also instituted cuts in the interest rates that private and public banking facilities could charge. He issued a directive that the Management and Planning Organization be affiliated to the government. In May 2011, Ahmadinejad announced that he would temporarily run the Oil Ministry.\n\nIn October 2006, Ahmadinejad began calling for the scrapping of Iran's existing birth-control policies which discouraged Iranian couples from having more than two children. He told MPs that Iran could cope with 50 million more people than the current 70 million. In November 2010, he urged Iranians to marry and reproduce earlier: \"We should take the age of marriage for boys to 20 and for girls to about 16 and 17.\" His remarks have drawn criticism and been called ill-judged at a time when Iran was struggling with surging inflation and rising unemployment, estimated at around 11%. Ahmadinejad's call was reminiscent of a call for Iranians to have more children made by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979. The policy had increased Iran's population by 16 million in seven years but had eventually been reversed in response to the resultant economic strain.\n\nIn 2008, the government sent the \"Family Protection Bill\" to the Iranian parliament. Women's rights activists criticized the bill for removing protections from women, such as the requirement that a husband obtain his wife's consent before marrying a second wife. Women's rights in Iran are more religiously based than those in secular countries.\n\nThe first legislation to emerge from his newly formed government was a 12 trillion rial (US$1.3 billion) fund called \"Reza's Compassion Fund\", named after Shi'a Imam Ali al-Rida. Ahmadinejad's government said this fund would tap Iran's oil revenues to help young people get jobs, afford marriage, and buy their own homes. The fund also sought charitable donations, with a board of trustees in each of Iran's 30 provinces. The legislation was a response to the cost of urban housing, which is pushing up the national average marital age (currently around 25 years for women and 28 years for men). In 2006 the Iranian parliament rejected the fund. However, Ahmadinejad ordered the administrative council to execute the plan.\n\nAccording to a report by Human Rights Watch, \"Since President Ahmadinejad came to power, treatment of detainees has worsened in Evin Prison as well as in detention centers operated clandestinely by the Judiciary, the Ministry of Information, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\" Human Rights Watch also has stated, \"Respect for basic human rights in Iran, especially freedom of expression and assembly, deteriorated in 2006. The government routinely tortures and mistreats detained dissidents, including through prolonged solitary confinement.\" Human Rights Watch described the source of human rights violations in contemporary Iran as coming from the Judiciary, accountable to Ali Khamenei, and from members directly appointed by Ahmadinejad.\n\nResponses to dissent have varied. Human Rights Watch writes that \"the Ahmadinejad government, in a pronounced shift from the policy under former president Mohammed Khatami, has shown no tolerance for peaceful protests and gatherings.\" In December 2006, Ahmadinejad advised officials not to disturb students who engaged in a protest during a speech of his at the Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, although speakers at other protests have included among their complaints that there had been a crackdown on dissent at universities since Ahmadinejad was elected.\n\nIn April 2007, the Tehran police, which is under Khamenei's supervision, began a crackdown on women with \"improper hijab.\" This led to criticism from associates of Ahmadinejad.\n\nIn 2012, Ahmadinejad claimed that AIDS was created by the West in order to weaken poorer countries, and repeated a previous claim that homosexual Iranians did not exist. He has also described homosexuality as \"ugly\".\n\nIn 2006, the Ahmadinejad government reportedly forced numerous Iranian scientists and university professors to resign or to retire. It has been referred to as the \"second cultural revolution\". The policy has been said to replace old professors with younger ones. Some university professors received letters indicating their early retirement unexpectedly. In November 2006, 53 university professors had to retire from Iran University of Science and Technology.\n\nIn 2006, Ahmadinejad's government applied a 50% quota for male students and 50% for female students in the university entrance exam for medicine, dentistry and pharmacy. The plan was supposed to stop the growing presence of female students in the universities. In a response to critics, Iranian minister of health and medical education, Kamran Bagheri Lankarani argued that there are not enough facilities such as dormitories for female students. Masoud Salehi, president of Zahedan University said that presence of women generates some problems with transportation. Also, Ebrahim Mekaniki, president of Babol University of Medical Sciences, stated that an increase in the presence of women will make it difficult to distribute facilities in a suitable manner. Bagher Larijani, the president of Tehran University of Medical Sciences made similar remarks. According to Rooz Online, the quotas lack a legal foundation and are justified as support for \"family\" and \"religion.\"\n\nIn December 2006, it was reported that some students were angry about the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, which they saw as promoting Holocaust denial.\n\nIn response to the students' slogans, the president said: \"We have been standing up to dictatorship so that no one will dare to establish dictatorship in a millennium even in the name of freedom. Given the scars inflicted on the Iranian nation by agents of the US and British dictatorship, no one will ever dare to initiate the rise of a dictator.\" It was reported that even though the protesters broke the TV cameras and threw hand-made bombs at Ahmadinejad, the president asked the officials not to question or disturb the protesters. In his blog, Ahmadinejad described his reaction to the incident as \"a feeling of joy\" because of the freedom that people enjoyed after the revolution.\n\nOne thousand students also protested the day before to denounce the increased pressure on the reformist groups at the university. One week prior, more than two thousand students protested at Tehran University on the country's annual student day, with speakers saying that there had been a crackdown on dissent at universities since Ahmadinejad was elected.\n\nAhmadinejad has been a vocal supporter of Iran's nuclear program, and has insisted that it is for peaceful purposes. He has repeatedly emphasized that building a nuclear bomb is not the policy of his government. He has said that such a policy is \"illegal and against our religion.\" He also added at a January 2006 conference in Tehran that a nation with \"culture, logic and civilization\" would not need nuclear weapons, and that countries that seek nuclear weapons are those that want to solve all problems by the use of force. In a 2008 interview Ahmadinejad elaborated that countries striving to obtain nuclear weapons are not politically progressive nations and those who possess them and continually make new generations of such bombs are \"even more backward\".\n\nIn April 2006, Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had successfully refined uranium to a stage suitable for the nuclear fuel cycle. In a speech to students and academics in Mashhad, he was quoted as saying that Iran's conditions had changed completely as it had become a nuclear state and could talk to other states from that stand. On 13 April 2006, Iran's news agency, Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), quoted Ahmadinejad as saying that the peaceful Iranian nuclear technology would not pose a threat to any party because \"we want peace and stability and we will not cause injustice to anyone and at the same time we will not submit to injustice.\" Nevertheless, Iran's nuclear policy under Ahmadinejad's administration has received much criticism, spearheaded by the United States and Israel. The accusations include that Iran is striving to obtain nuclear arms and developing long-range firing capabilities—and that Ahmadinejad issued an order to keep UN inspectors from freely visiting the nation's nuclear facilities and viewing their designs, in defiance of an IAEA resolution. Following a May 2009 test launch of a long-range missile, Ahmadinejad was quoted as telling the crowd that with its nuclear program, Iran was sending the West a message that \"the Islamic Republic of Iran is running the show.\"\n\nDespite Ahmadinejad's vocal support for the program, the office of the Iranian president is not directly responsible for nuclear policy. It is instead set by the Supreme National Security Council. The council includes two representatives appointed by the Supreme Leader, military officials, and members of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government, and reports directly to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who issued a fatwa against nuclear weapons in 2005. Khamenei has criticized Ahmadinejad's \"personalization\" of the nuclear issue.\n\nAhmadinejad vowed in February 2008 that Iran will not be held back from developing its peaceful nuclear program and has stated that at least 16 different peaceful uses for nuclear technology have so far been identified. Ahmadinejad has stressed the importance of the right to peaceful nuclear development. Iranian opposition leader, Mousavi, has even stated that giving up the country's nuclear program would be \"irreparable\" and that the Iranian people support the nuclear program. \"No one in Iran will accept suspension,\" Mousavi has said, adding that if elected, his policy would be to work to provide \"guarantees\" that Tehran's nuclear activities would never divert to non-peaceful aims.\n\nIn October 2009, the United States, France, and Russia proposed a U.N.-drafted deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program, in an effort to find a compromise between Iran's stated need for a nuclear reactor and the concerns of those who are worried that Iran harbors a secret intent of developing a nuclear weapon. After some delay in responding, on 29 October, Ahmadinejad seemed to change his tone towards the deal. \"We welcome fuel exchange, nuclear co-operation, building of power plants and reactors and we are ready to co-operate,\" he said in a live broadcast on state television. However, he added that Iran would not retreat \"one iota\" on its right to a sovereign nuclear program.\n\nAccording to Brussels-based NGO International Crisis Group, Ahmadinejad has been criticized for attacking private \"plunderers\" and \"corrupt officials,\" while engaging in \"cronyism and political favouritism\". Many of his close associates were appointed to positions for which they have no obvious qualifications, and \"billion dollar no-bid contracts\" were awarded to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an organization with which he is strongly associated.\n\nAccording to Najmeh Bozorgmehr of Financial Times, \"Iran has a long history of cronyism and corruption under its monarchies and the Islamic Republic. But the scale of corruption under Mr. Ahmadinejad was of a different order, according to both reform-minded and conservative politicians.\"\n\nIn June 2007, Ahmadinejad was criticized by some Iranian parliament members over his remark about Christianity and Judaism. According to Aftab News Agency, Ahmadinejad stated: \"In the world, there are deviations from the right path: Christianity and Judaism. Dollars have been devoted to the propagation of these deviations. There are also false claims that these [religions] will save mankind. But Islam is the only religion that [can] save mankind.\" Some members of Iranian parliament criticized these remarks as being fuels to religious war.\n\nConservative MP Rafat Bayat has accused Ahmadinejad for a decline in observance of the required hijab for women, calling him \"not that strict on this issue\". Ahmadinejad was also accused of indecency by people close to Rafsanjani, after he publicly kissed the hand of a woman who used to be his school teacher.\n\nThere are two statements that led to criticism from some religious authorities. One concerns his speech at the United Nations, and the other concerns the attendance of women at football matches. During a visit to group of Ayatollahs in Qom after returning from his 2005 speech to the UN General Assembly, Ahmadinejad stated he had \"felt a halo over his head\" during his speech and that a hidden presence had mesmerized the unblinking audience of foreign leaders, foreign ministers, and ambassadors. Ahmedinejad closed his speech with a call for the \"mighty Lord\" to \"hasten the emergence\" of Imam Mahdi. According to Iranian-American journalist Hooman Majd, the response given to Ahmedinejad at the assembly was offensive to the conservative religious leaders because an ordinary man cannot presume a special closeness to God or any of the Imams, nor can he imply the presence of the Mahdi.\n\nIn another statement in 2006, Ahmadinejad proclaimed (without consulting the clerics beforehand), that women be allowed into football stadiums to watch male football clubs compete. This proclamation \"was quickly overruled\" by clerical authorities, one of whom, Grand Ayatollah Mohammad Fazel Lankarani \"refused for weeks to meet with President Ahmadinejad\" in early 2007.\n\nIn 2008, a serious conflict emerged between the Iranian President and the head of parliament over three laws approved by the Iranian parliament: \"the agreement for civil and criminal legal cooperation between Iran and Kyrgyzstan\", \"the agreement to support mutual investment between Iran and Kuwait\", and \"the law for registration of industrial designs and trademarks\". The conflict was so serious that the Iranian leader stepped in to resolve it. Ahmadinejad wrote a letter to the parliamentary speaker Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel, furiously denouncing him for the \"inexplicable act\" of bypassing the presidency by giving the order to implement legislation in an official newspaper. Ahmadinejad accused the head of parliament of violating Iranian constitutional law. He called for legal action against the parliament speaker. Haddad-Adel responded to Ahmadinejad accusing him of using inappropriate language in his remarks and letters.\n\nIn August 2008, Ahmadinejad appointed Ali Kordan as interior minister. Kordan's appointment was heavily criticized by Iranian parliamentarians, media and analysts after it came to light that a doctoral degree purportedly awarded to Kordan was fabricated, and that the putative issuer of the degree, Oxford University, had no record of Kordan receiving any degree from the University. It was also revealed that he had been jailed in 1978 for moral charges.\n\nIn November 2008, Ahmadinejad announced that he was against impeachment of Kordan by Iranian parliament. He refused to attend the parliament on the impeachment day. Kordan was expelled from office by Iranian parliament on 4 November 2008. 188 MPs voted against him. An impeachment of Kordan would push Ahmadinejad close to having to submit his entire cabinet for review by parliament, which was led by one of his chief political opponents. Iran's constitution requires that step if more than half the cabinet ministers are replaced, and Ahmadinejad replaced nine of 21 until that date.\n\nIn February 2009, after Supreme Audit Court of Iran reported that $1.058 billion of surplus oil revenue in the (2006–2007) budget hadn't been returned by the government to the national treasury, Ali Larijani, Iran's parliamentary speaker, called for further investigations to make sure the missing funds are returned to the treasury as soon as possible. Tensions between Larijani and Ahmadinejad continued into 2013.\n\nAhmadinejad criticized the National Audit Office for what he called its \"carelessness\", saying the report \"incites the people\" against the government. The head of the parliament energy commission, Hamidreza Katouzian, reported \"The government spent $5 billion to import fuel, about $2 billion more than the sum parliament had authorized.\" Katouzian quoted Iran's Oil Minister, Gholam-Hossein Nozari, as saying that President Ahmadinejad had ordered the extra purchase.\n\nIn May 2011, several members of parliament threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against Ahmadinejad after his merger of eight government ministries and the firing of three ministers without parliament's consent. According to the Majles news website, MP Mohammad Reza Bahonar stated, \"legal purging starts with questions, which lead to warnings and end with impeachment.\" On 25 May, parliament voted to investigate another allegation, that Ahmadinejad had committed election irregularities by giving cash to up to nine million Iranians before the 2009 presidential elections. The vote came within hours after the allegations appeared in several popular conservative news sites associated with supreme leader Ali Khamenei, suggesting the supreme leader supported the investigation. The disputes were seen as part of the clash between Ahmadinejad and other conservatives and former supporters, including supreme leader Khamenei, over what the conservatives see as Ahmadinejad's confrontational policies and abuse of power.\n\nEarly in his presidency, Ahmadinejad was sometimes described as \"enjoy[ing] the full backing\" of the Supreme Leader , and even as being his \"protege.\" In Ahmadinejad's 2005 inauguration the supreme leader allowed Ahmadinejad to kiss his hand and cheeks in what was called \"a sign of closeness and loyalty,\" and after the 2009 election fully endorsed Ahmadinejad against protesters. However, as early as January 2008 signs of disagreement between the two men developed over domestic policies, and by the period of 2010–11 several sources detected a \"growing rift\" between them. The disagreement was described as centered on Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, a top adviser and close confidant of Ahmadinejad and opponent of \"greater involvement of clerics in politics\", who was first vice president of Iran until being ordered to resign from the cabinet by the supreme leader.\n\nIn 2009, Ahmadinejad dismissed Intelligence Minister Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i, an opponent of Mashaei. In April 2011, another Intelligence minister, Heydar Moslehi, resigned after being asked to by Ahmadinejad, but was reinstated by the supreme leader within hours. Ahmadinejad declined to officially back Moslehi's reinstatement for two weeks and in protest engaged in an \"11-day walkout\" of cabinet meetings, religious ceremonies, and other official functions. Ahmadinejad's actions led to angry public attacks by clerics, parliamentarians and military commanders, who accused him of ignoring orders from the supreme leader. Conservative opponents in parliament launched an \"impeachment drive\" against him, four websites with ties to Ahmadinejad reportedly were \"filtered and blocked\", and several people \"said to be close\" to the president and Mashaei (such as Abbas Amirifar and Mohammed Sharif Malekzadeh) were arrested on charges of being \"magicians\" and invoking djinns. On 6 May 2011, it was reported that Ahmadinejad had been given an ultimatum to accept the leader's intervention or resign, and on 8 May he \"apparently bowed\" to the reinstatement, welcoming back Moslehi to a cabinet meeting. The events have been said to have \"humiliated and weakened\" Ahmadinejad, though the president denied that there had been any rift between the two, and according to the semiofficial Fars News Agency, he stated that his relationship with the supreme leader \"is that of a father and a son.\"\n\nIn 2012, Khamenei ordered a halt to a parliamentary inquiry into Ahmadinejad's mishandling of the Iranian economy. In 2016, Khamenei advised Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, his former ally with whom his relationship was strained after Ahmadinejad accused his son Mojtaba Khamenei of embezzling from the state treasury, to not run for president again.\n\nAhmedinejad was criticised by the religious and political groups in Iran for photographs taken of him embracing Elena Frias de Chavez, the mother of recently deceased Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, at his funeral. In the image, Ahmedinejad was thought to be holding her hands and in a cheek-to-cheek embrace; such an act, touching an unrelated woman, is considered haraam (forbidden) in Islam. Iranian government officials responded by stating that the image was a fake, then released a second photo showing Ahmadinejad in the same pose, but in this case hugging a man. This later photograph was debunked when it was discovered that the other man was Egyptian opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei, who had not been at the funeral.\n\nOne of the most frequent criticisms about Ahmedinejad has been nepotism in his governments. Nepotism was one of his habits in appointing senior government officials. His elder brother, Davoud, was appointed chief inspector at the presidency in 2005 and was in office until 2008. His sister, Parvin, served at the presidential's women's center. His nephew, Ali Akbar Mehrabian, served as the mining and industry minister in his cabinet. His daughter's father-in-law, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, served at several senior positions. His brother-in-law, Masoud Zaribafan, served as cabinet secretary.\n\nDuring Ahmadinejad's tenure as President of Iran the foreign policy of the country took a different approach from the previous administration. Relations with developed countries generally soured while relations with less-developed countries, including Africa and Latin America, rose. In light of the calls for sanctions on Iran for its nuclear weapons programme, Ahmadinejad and his foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, traveled extensively throughout the two regions, as well as hosted other leaders. Relations with the ALBA states, and Venezuela, Bolivia, and Ecuador, in particular, were most strengthened. Relations with America during the Bush administration and Israel deteriorated further.\n\nAhmadinejad is an outspoken critic of the Western world and is often criticized for his hostility towards the United States, Israel, the United Kingdom and other Western nations.\n\nAhmadinejad abides by Iran's long-standing policy of refusing to recognize Israel as a legitimate state, and wants the Jewish people who immigrated to Israel to return to their \"fatherlands\" (\"translated\").\n\nIn 2005, Ahmadinejad, in a speech praising the Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khomeini, was translated by Iranian state-run media as saying that \"Israel must be wiped off the map.\" A controversy erupted over the translation, with specialists such as Juan Cole of the University of Michigan and Arash Norouzi of the Mossadegh Project pointing out that the original statement in Farsi did not say that Israel should be wiped off the map, but instead that it would collapse. The words 'Israel', 'map', and 'to wipe off' are non-existent in the Iranian speech's original. According to another IRNA translation, on the occasion of a commemoration of the anniversary of Khomeini's death on 3 June 2008, Ahmadinejad stated that \"The corrupt element will be wiped off the map.\" Contextually, Ahmadinejad was quoting Khomeini's words about the imminent disappearance of the Soviet Union and the Shah's regime, and tacked on his remarks concerning Israel. In Katajun Amirpur's analysis, there is no implication in the text that Iran intended destroying Israel or annihilating the Jewish people, any more than Khomeini was suggesting with his words that the Russians, or the Iranian people themselves under the Shah would be extinguished. Ahmadinejad is on the record as stating that Iran had no plans to attack Israel. The statement itself was in fact a citation, with a minute verbal variation, of a remark made by Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, which had created no furor at the time, but did so when Ahmadinejad quoted them in 2005.\nDan Meridor, Israel's minister of intelligence and atomic energy said during an Al Jazeera interview that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had repeatedly said \"that Israel is an unnatural creature, it will not survive. They didn't say, 'We'll wipe it out,' you're right, but, 'It will not survive.'\" adding \"If Iran says this, and continues to pile up uranium that they enrich, and build missiles in big numbers, and have a nuclear military plan—if you put all this together, you can't say, they don't really mean it.\" The Washington Post's fact-checker editor Glenn Kessler says the interpretation gets murkier when Ahmadinejad's quote is set against other Iranian propaganda. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iranian specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, cites proof that the Iranian government releases propaganda that clearly says Israel should be \"wiped off.\" Joshua Teitelbaum of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs discovered pictures of Iranian propaganda banners that clearly say in English: \"Israel should be wiped out of the face of the world.\" In March 2016, Iran tested a ballistic missile painted with the phrase \"Israel should be wiped off the Earth\" in Hebrew. The missile is reported to be capable of reaching Israel.\n\nThe Official Web site of the President of Iran quoted Ahmadinejad as saying on 15 May 2011 \"The reason for our insistence that the Zionist regime should be wiped out and vanished is that the Zionist regime is the main base for imposing oppression and harbors the main terrorists of the world.\"\n\nHe was strongly criticized after claiming that the Jews invented the Holocaust and making other statements influenced by \"classic anti-Semitic ideas,\" which has led to accusations of antisemitism. Ahmedinejad denied that he was an antisemite, saying that he \"respects Jews very much\" and that he was not \"passing judgment\" on the Holocaust. Later, Ahmedinejad claimed that promoting Holocaust denial was a major achievement of his presidency; he stated that \"put[ting] it forward at the global level... broke the spine of the Western capitalist regime\". The comments appeared on the Arabic but not on the English version of Fars News Agency's website.\n\nHe advocates \"free elections\" for the region, and believes Palestinians need a stronger voice in the region's future. On Quds Day in September 2010 Ahmadinejad criticized the Palestinian Authority over its president's decision to renew direct peace talks with Israel saying the talks are \"stillborn\" and \"doomed to fail\", urging the Palestinians to continue armed resistance to Israel. He said that Mahmoud Abbas had no authority to negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for the Palestinian Authority, fired back, saying, Ahmadinejad \"does not represent the Iranian people..., is not entitled to talk about Palestine, or the President of Palestine\"\n\nIn September 2010, Ahmadinejad sparked controversy at the 65th session of the United Nations General Assembly by claiming that most people believe the United States government was behind the 9/11 attacks and later called for an inquiry, stating: \"The fact-finding mission can shed light on who the perpetrators were, who is al-Qaeda... where does it exist? Who was it backed by and supported? All these should come to light.\"<ref name=\"9/11 insight\"></ref> The speech triggered many countries' United Nations representatives to walk out, and US President Barack Obama described the claims as \"inexcusable,\" \"offensive\" and \"hateful.\" In 2010, Ahmadinejad reiterated the 9/11 conspiracy, and wrote:\n\nHe made similar comments at the 66th session in September 2011.\n\nAhmadinejad is said to have \"forged a close public friendship\" with Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. On Chavez's death in March 2013, Ahmadinejad posted a condolence message on his website stating, \"I have no doubt that he [Chavez] will return alongside Jesus Christ and Mahdi to establish peace and justice in the world\".\n\nAhmedinejad left his office at Pasteur st. on 3 August 2013 and returned to his private house in Narmak.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Ahmadinejad said that, after the end of his presidency, he would return to the university and retire from politics. However, Ahmadinejad announced from Russia on the sidelines of an OPEC summit on 2 July 2013 that he might stay involved with politics by creating a new party or non-governmental organization. In late July, \"Mehr news agency\" reported that Ahmadinejad obtained permission from the Supreme Cultural Revolution Council to launch a university for post-graduate studies in Tehran. On 5 August 2013, the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued a decree appointing Ahmedinejad as a member of the Expediency Council. On 15 June 2015, a number of Ahmadinejad's cabinet ministers established a new political party, called YEKTA Front. The party published list for 2016 legislative election and some of Ahmadinejad's cabinet members (like Hamid-Reza Haji Babaee, Sadeq Khalilian, Mohammad Abbasi and Mahmoud Bahmani) registered for the election, but Ahmadinejad did not support any list in the election.\n\nIt was rumored that Ahmadinejad would run for presidency again in 2017 after he did not deny plans when questioned by the media in 2015. Ahmadinejad remained mostly out of the public eye since leaving office, but his anti-Western rhetoric and combative style remained popular among many Iranian Principlists, and he was widely viewed as among the most formidable political figures capable of unseating Hassan Rouhani. In December 2015, it was reported that he had begun his presidential campaign by appointing his campaign's chiefs. He also began provincial travels in April 2016 by traveling to Amol. Travels were continued until September 2016, when he traveled to Gorgan. Ahmadinejad's advisors said his travels were not electoral and he only delivered speeches due to public demand. In September 2016, it was rumored that Ahmadinejad had asked Ali Khamenei, Supreme Leader of Iran, for permission to run for the office and was rejected by Khamenei, who said that it was not in the best interests of Iran. On 26 September 2016, Ayatollah Khamenei confirmed the news, stated that it was only advice, not an order. It was the first time since Khamenei's election as Supreme Leader in 1989 that he advised a person to not run for election. Formerly, some candidates had asked him for advice (former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani for his campaign in 2005 and 2013), but Khamenei chose to not give his opinion on those occasions. The following day, Ahmadinejad officially announced he will not run in the upcoming 2017 presidential election. He later supported Hamid Baghaei's candidacy. However, Ahmadinejad registered as presidential candidate on 12 April 2017. He was disqualified by the Guardian Council on 20 April 2017, making him the second person after Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to be barred from running the office for a third term.\n\nDuring the 2017–18 Iranian protests Ahmedinejad criticized current government of Iran and later supreme leader Ali Khamenei.\n\nAhmadinejad has been an active and prominent member of the right-wing Islamic Society of Engineers since its establishment until 2005. As of 2014, he is still a member of the party but is not active since 2005. He was also a founding member of the Society of Devotees of the Islamic Revolution, but left in 2011.\n\nSince 2005, Ahmadinejad has introduced himself as non-partisan, even anti-party and did not try to gain support of political parties despite being supported by the conservative camp. A National Democratic Institute report published in 2009 states that Ahmadinejad is self-described \"Principlist\".\n\nAhmadinejad is widely known for his vulgarism, undiplomatic language and usage of slang terms. He is active on Twitter, where he engages his followers primarily in English and tweets about sports, the United States, and current events using pop cultural references that have been described as funny and \"woke\".\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by \"Information and Public Opinion Solutions LLC\" (iPOS) in March 2016, Ahmadinejad is the least popular political figure in Iran, while he has 57% approval and 39% disapproval ratings, thus a +18% net popularity.\n\nPolls conducted by Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM) & IranPoll with +/- 3.2% margin of error shows his approval rating as follows:\n\nAhmadinejad is married, and has one daughter and two sons. His oldest son married a daughter of Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei in 2008. One of his sons studied at the Amirkabir University of Technology (Tehran Polytechnic).\n\nSupporters of Ahmadinejad consider him a simple man who leads a modest life. As president, he wanted to continue living in the same house in Tehran his family had been living in until his security advisers insisted that he should move. Ahmadinejad had the antique Persian carpets in the Presidential palace sent to a carpet museum, and opted instead to use inexpensive carpets. He is said to have refused the VIP seat on the Presidential plane, and that he eventually replaced it with a cargo plane instead. Upon gaining Iran's presidency, Ahmadinejad held his first cabinet meeting in the Imam Reza shrine at Mashhad, an act perceived as \"pious\". He also used to lay an extra place for the 12th Imam at his weekly cabinet briefings.\n\n\n\n"}

It was inscribed to the list of World Heritage Sites in 1988 as a result of the diversity of life present within it. Notable species include black rhinoceroses, elephants, Sudan cheetahs, leopards, red-fronted gazelles, and buffalo, giraffes, lions; a wide range of waterfowl species also occurs in the northern floodplains. The site is under threat due to its rare wildlife dying and animals species being wiped out. The western black rhinoceros that was indigenous to the Central African Republic has gone extinct in 2011. The site was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger after reports of illegal grazing and poaching by heavily armed hunters, who may have harvested as much as 80% of the park's wildlife. The shooting of four members of the park staff in early 1997 and a general state of deteriorating security brought all development projects and tourism to a halt. The government of the Central African Republic proposed to assign site management responsibility to a private foundation. The preparation of a detailed state of conservation report and rehabilitation plan for the site was recommended by the World Heritage Committee at its 1998 session. People are working on breeding programs to revive the natural wildlife.\n\nThe park occupies most of the eastern end of Bamingui-Bangoran province in the north of the country. The park's northern boundary is the international border with Chad on the Aouk (Bahr) and Kameur Rivers. The eastern border is the Vakaga River, the western border is the Manovo River about 40 km east of N'Délé, and the southern border is the ridge of the Massif des Bongo. The Ndéle-Birao road runs through the park.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8296305", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8296305", "title": "Mokilese language", "text": "Mokilese language\n\nMokilese also known as Mwoakilloan, Mwokilese, or Mwoakilese is a Micronesian language originally spoken on Mwoakilloa, Federated States of Micronesia. Of the 1200 Mokilese speakers, only about 500 live on Mwoakilloa.\n\nMokilese originated from the Mokil (or Mwoakilloa) Atoll, but speakers have also migrated approximately 100 miles west, to the Pohnpei Islands, and parts of the United States. Mwoakilloa and Pohnpei are both geographically part of the Caroline Islands just above Papua New Guinea. Mwoakilloa is a district of the outlying islands of Pohnpei of the Federated States of Micronesia. \n\nBefore Western contact, Mokilese only had contact with its neighboring islands: Pohnpei, Pingelap, Kosrae, and the Marshall Islands. After Spanish explorers \"rediscovered\" Mokil Atoll, they colonized it in 1886 (Hezel, 1992). Shortly after they lost the Spanish-American War in 1898, they sold it to Germany (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014). Later, in 1914, it was seized by Japan and heavily fortified during World War II, until Japan surrendered and passed it on to the United States in August 1945 (Hezel, 1992). Thereafter, it became a part of the UN trust territory under U.S. jurisdiction in 1947 until the trust territory dissolved in 1986 (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014).\n\nMokilese is both the name of the Mokil population and the language which they speak. It is currently spoken on Mokil Atoll, the Pohnpei Islands, and in some parts of the United States. There are only approximately 1,500 speakers of this language left. 1,050 of whom reside in Micronesia; a little over 900 in Pohnpei and less than 150 in Mokil Atoll. The other 450 speakers are scattered across the United States (Lewis, Simons, & Fennig, 2013). Although this language originated in Mokil Atoll, there are now only around 150 speakers who live in Mokil Atoll, while the rest live in diaspora communities ―approximately 100 miles west― to Pohnpei, where they remain until this day (Rehg & Bender, 1990).\n\nMokilese is a Micronesian language, and therefore, a part of the Austronesian language family. Mokilese belongs to the Ponapeic subgrouping, and is the sister language of Pingelapese and Pohnpeian. Mokilese shares approximately 79% lexical similarity with Pingelapese, and 75% with Pohnapeian (Lewis, Simons, & Fennig, 2013).\n\nThe Mokilese language consists of the following consonant phonemes: /p, b, f, v, m, θ, ð, t, d, s, z, n, l, r, c, j, ŋ̃, y, k, g, ŋ, pʷ, mʷ, and w/ (Harrison & Albert, 1976). Note, that these are not the number of consonants that they use in writing, but rather the number of different consonant sounds they produce. There are also quite a few consonant allophones in the Mokilese language: /p, pʷ, m, mʷ, t, θ, d, ð, n, ŋ̃, ŋ/.\n\nThe vowel phonemes present in Mokilese are: /i, e, ɛ, ɨ, ʉ, ə, ʌ, a, u, o, and ɔ/ (Harrison & Albert, 1976). Mokilese use both long and short vowels for all existing vowels. Mokilese also allows triphthongs in their language, which is rare among the Pacific languages.\n\n\nMokilese uses words which begin and end with a consonant, begin and end with a vowel, begin with a vowel and end with a consonant, and even ones that begin with a consonant and end with a vowel. However, this does not mean that there are no rule at all. Mokilese syllable still maintain a set of rules as explained by Harrison and Albert (1976):\n\n\n\n\n In the Pohnpeic languages, geminate obstruents are realized as homorganic nasal-obstruent clusters.<br>\n\nThe basic word order for Mokilese is Subject-Verb-Object (Harrison & Albert, 1976).\n\n‘‘ex. Woal lapp-o loakjid phon woss-o. ’’\nMan old-that to fish on reef-that\nThat old man is fishing on the reef.\n\nThis example shows the subject (man) comes first, then the verb (to fish), and lastly, the object (reef).\n\nThere are many forms of reduplication in Mokilese. The most common reduplication form is a reduplication of the first CVC of a word.\n\n\nNext, there’s the CVh reduplication form. This is the reduplication of the first CV of a word and lengthening of the vowel with /h/.\n\n\nAnother reduplication form Mokilese has is VCC. When reduplicating VC, the consonant is also geminated.\n\n\nThere is also the CV reduplication, which reduplicates the first CV of a word. However, sometimes the CV reduplication can become CVV.\n\nLastly, there is also the CVC reduplication form. CVC reduplicates the last CVC of a word rather than the first, and it is also a suffix, unlike the other forms, which are prefixes.\n\n\nMokilese has a base 10 counting system. Rather than having just one set of numbers, Mokilese has four sets, each used to count different things. Each number consist of a numeral prefix and a numeral classifier. Most of the numeral prefixes are similar across the four different sets, it is the general classifier that distinguishes one set from another. The four general classifiers are ‘‘–w, ‘‘–men, ‘‘–pas, and ‘‘–kij, as shown in the chart below.\n\n‘‘–w’’ is a general classifier; it is used to count numbers and describe other objects that are not covered by the other number classifiers.\n\n\n‘‘-men’’ describes animate nouns such as people, bird, animal, fish, etc.\n\n\n‘‘-pas’’ is used to describe long objects like pencil, canoe, songs, stories, road, etc.\n\n‘‘-kij’’ is for describing things that have parts and pieces such as slices of bread, sheets of paper, fragment of a mirror, etc.\n\n\nMokilese’s numerals can also reach up to the billions. However, most of the higher numerals are rarely used because there are only so many things that they would need to count in millions or billions.\n\n\nMokilese has borrowed numerous words from languages of foreigners who traveled into Micronesia, as well as from other Micronesian languages. Some Micronesian languages that influenced Mokilese were Pohnpeian, Marshallese, Pingelapese, and Kusaiean (Rehg & Bender, 1990). The reason why Mokilese borrowed words from these languages was because they had lived in close contact with the people of these islands for many years. Because of how this borrowing occurred, it is hard to tell exactly when the words were borrowed, especially since there were hardly any documentations from back then. On top of that, not all loanwords are easy to identify because these languages are all, more or less, closely related to Mokilese. Sheldon P. Harrison (1976) believed there to be more loanwords from other Micronesian languages, but “it is difficult to tell exactly how many because of the problems in distinguishing such borrowings from native Mokilese words.” With that said, a few loanwords from these places have been identified.\n\nWords derived from Pohnpeian:\n\n\nWords derived from Marshallese:\n\n\nWord derived from Marshallese:\n\n\nMokilese also borrowed words from foreign languages such as German, Spanish, Japanese, and English. These borrowings occurred due to colonization. The first of these languages to come in contact with Mokilese was Spanish, which occurred in the 16th century, when Spanish explorers discovered Micronesia (Hezel, 1992). Then they colonized the Mokil Atoll in 1886. Shortly after, Spain sold the island to Germany after they lost the Spanish–American War in 1898 (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014). Later, in 1914, the island was seized by Japan in 1919, and heavily fortified during World War II, until they surrendered and passed it on to United States in August of 1945 (Hezel, 1992). Thereafter, it became part of a UN trust territory under U.S. jurisdiction in 1947 until the trust territory dissolved in 1986 (Encyclopædia Britannica, 2014). All this outside contact introduced many loanwords to Mokilese, although there are only a few for Spanish and German because their contact durations were shorter.\n\nWord derived from Spanish:\n\n\nWord derived from German:\n\n\nWord derived from Japanese:\n\n\nWord derived from English (before WWII):\n\nWord derived from English (after WWII):\n\n\n Not only is the Mokilese language endangered, it also lacks extensive documentation. The complete published resources are a Mokilese-English Dictionary (Harrison & Albert, 1977) and a Mokilese Reference Grammar (Harrison & Albert, 1976). However these resources are fairly outdated since they were written in the 1960s and the language is changing rapidly. Other physical materials in Mokilese are books of chants, songs, accounts and tales of Mokil Atoll, which are few. There is also one short interview video, and a couple of war dance videos on YouTube. However, there are no websites, TV shows, or radio stations in their language.\n\n Mokilese is an endangered language. It is only spoken at home, and the intergenerational transmission is getting worse with each generation. This is because the younger generations are not fluent speakers, they prefer learning Pohnpeian and English instead, so only the elders and adults are actually fluent (Poll, 2013). This is just for the Mokilese speakers in Pohnpei and Mokil Atoll; the speakers in the U. S. are all old and have no domains of use, so when they die, there will be no more speakers in the United States (Lewis, Simons, & Fennig, 2013). On top of that, Mokilese not only does not have government recognition, there is not even a single school that teaches Mokilese (Poll, 2013).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1355944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1355944", "title": "Mr Creosote", "text": "Mr Creosote\n\nMr. Creosote is a fictional character who appears in Monty Python's \"The Meaning of Life\". He is a monstrously obese restaurant patron who is served a vast amount of food whilst vomiting repeatedly. After being persuaded to eat an after-dinner mint, he explodes in a very graphic way. The sketch opens the film's segment titled \"Part VI: The Autumn Years\".\n\nThe character is played by Terry Jones, who directed the film.\n\nIn the sketch, Mr. Creosote dines at a French restaurant. The entrance of this morbidly obese middle-aged man is accompanied by ominous music. One of the fish in the aquarium exclaims \"Oh shit—it's Mr. Creosote!\" as he passes, causing all the fish to swim for cover. The scene opens with a short dialogue between Mr. Creosote and the maître d', played by John Cleese:\n\n\nCreosote is then led to his table, and once seated starts projectile-vomiting, failing to hit the bucket he had requested a moment before. The floor quickly becomes covered in , and so do the cleaning woman and the maître d's trousers. Creosote listens patiently while highlights of the evening's menu are recited to him; after vomiting on the menu held open in front of him by the maître d', he orders all of the dishes listed by the maitre d'. As a result, he is served moules marinières, pâté de foie gras, beluga caviar, Eggs Benedict, a leek tart, frogs' legs amandine and quail's eggs with puréed mushrooms all mixed in a bucket with the quail eggs on top and a double helping of pâté. The appetizers are followed by the main course of jugged hare, with a sauce of truffles, bacon, Grand Marnier, anchovies and cream. For drinks, Mr. Creosote has six bottles of Château Latour 1945, a Methuselah (Double Jeroboam/6 litres) of champagne, and half a dozen crates of brown ale (144 bottles)—considerably less than his usual fare.\n\n\nHe finishes the feast, and several other courses, vomiting profusely all over himself, his table, and the restaurant's staff throughout his meal, causing other diners to lose their appetite, and in some cases, throw up as well. Finally, after being persuaded by the smooth maître d' to eat a single \"wafer-thin mint\", his stomach begins to rapidly expand until it explodes: covering the restaurant and diners with viscera and partially digested food—even starting a \"vomit-wave\" among the other diners, who leave in disgust.\n\nWhen the explosion clears, Creosote is amazingly still alive, but his chest cavity and abdomen are now blasted open, revealing his spread ribs and intact, still-beating heart, and viscera. As he looks around, seemingly confused by what has just happened, the maître d' calmly walks up to him and presents, \"the cheque, monsieur.\"\n\nIn the documentary \"The Meaning of Making 'The Meaning of Life\"' (2003), John Cleese said that the sketch, originally written by Jones and Michael Palin, was initially rejected. Cleese said the sketch suffered from a flawed construction and rewrote it with Graham Chapman. At the \"U.S. Comedy Arts Festival — Tribute to Monty Python\" it was claimed Cleese was taken with the unflappable maître d' character. Jones thought Creosote should be played by fellow Python Terry Gilliam, before Gilliam persuaded Jones to play the role instead.\n\nJones was transformed into Mr. Creosote by British prosthetic make-up artist Christopher Tucker, who also created the prosthetic effects for the American film drama \"The Elephant Man\" (1980).\n\nThe was portrayed using large amounts of condensed minestrone soup. This made a considerable mess of the filming location, the Seymour Leisure Centre in Paddington.\n\nWhen asked about his proclivity toward gruesome film violence, director Quentin Tarantino said that the \"Mr. Creosote\" scene was the only time he had been disturbed by a graphic or gruesome film sequence.\n\nIn his \"2015 Movie Guide\", Leonard Maltin described Mr. Creosote as having \"an unforgettable scene, like it or not\".\n"}
{"id": "681745", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=681745", "title": "Native Hawaiians", "text": "Native Hawaiians\n\nNative Hawaiians (Hawaiian: \"kānaka ʻōiwi\", \"kānaka maoli\", and \"Hawaiʻi maoli\") are the aboriginal Polynesian people of the Hawaiian Islands or their descendants. Native Hawaiians trace their ancestry back to the original Polynesian settlers of Hawaii. In total, 527,000 Americans consider themselves Native Hawaiian.\n\nAccording to the 2010 U.S. Census, there are 371,000 people who identified themselves as being \"Native Hawaiian\" alone or in combination with one or more other races or Pacific Islander groups. 156,000 people identified themselves as being \"Native Hawaiian\" alone.\n\nThe majority of Native Hawaiians reside in the state of Hawaii (two-thirds), and the rest are scattered among other states, especially in the American Southwest, and with a high concentration in California.\n\nThe history of Native Hawaiians, like the history of Hawaii, is commonly classified into four major periods:\n\nOne theory is that the first Polynesians arrived in Hawaii in the 3rd century from the Marquesas by travelling in groups of wakas, and were followed by Tahitians in AD 1300, who then conquered the original inhabitants. Another is that a single, extended period of settlement populated the islands.\nEvidence for a Tahitian conquest of the islands include the legends of Hawaiiloa and the navigator-priest Paao, who is said to have made a voyage between Hawaii and the island of \"Kahiki\" (Tahiti) and introduced many customs. Early historians, such as Fornander and Beckwith, subscribed to this Tahitian invasion theory, but later historians, such as Kirch, do not mention it. King Kalakaua claimed that Pa'ao was from Samoa.\n\nSome writers claim that other settlers in Hawaii were forced into remote valleys by newer arrivals. They claim that stories about the Menehune, little people who built heiau and fishponds, prove the existence of ancient peoples who settled the islands before the Hawaiians.\n\nAt the time of Captain Cook's arrival in 1778, the population is estimated to have been between 250,000 and 800,000. Over the span of the first century after first contact, the native Hawaiians were nearly wiped out by diseases introduced to the islands. Native Hawaiians had no resistance to influenza, smallpox, measles, or whooping cough, among others. The 1900 U.S. Census identified 37,656 residents of full or partial native Hawaiian ancestry. The 2000 U.S. Census identified 283,430 residents of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander ancestry, showing a dramatic growth trend since annexation by the U.S. in 1898.\n\nThe Hawaiian language (or ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi) was once the primary language of the native Hawaiian people; today, native Hawaiians predominantly speak the English language. A major factor for this change was an 1896 law that required that English \"be the only medium and basis of instruction in all public and private schools\". This law prevented the Hawaiian language from being taught as a second language. In spite of this, some native Hawaiians (as well as non-native Hawaiians) have learned ʻŌlelo as a second language. As with others local to Hawaii, native Hawaiians often speak Hawaiian Creole English (referred to in Hawai'i as Pidgin), a creole which developed during Hawaiʻi's plantation era in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries with the influence of the various ethnic groups living in Hawaii during that time.\n\nNowadays ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi is the official language of the State of Hawaii, alongside English. The Hawaiian language has been promoted for revival most recently by a state program of cultural preservation enacted in 1978. Programs included the opening of Hawaiian language immersion schools, and the establishment of a Hawaiian language department at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. As a result, Hawaiian language learning has climbed among all races in Hawaiʻi.\n\nIn 2006, the University of Hawaii at Hilo established a masters program in the Hawaiian Language. In fall 2006, they established a doctoral (Ph.D) program in the Hawaiian Language. In addition to being the first doctoral program for the study of Hawaiian, it is the first doctoral program established for the study of any native language in the United States of America. Both the masters and doctoral programs are considered by global scholars as pioneering in the revival of native languages.\n\nHawaiian is still spoken as the primary language by the residents on the private island of Niʻihau.\n\nAlongside ʻŌlelo Hawaiʻi, some Maoli (Native Hawaiians) spoke Hawaiʻi Sign Language (or HSL). Little is known about the language by Western academics and efforts are being made to preserve and revitalize the language.\n\nHawaiian children are publicly educated under the same terms as any other children in the United States. In Hawaii, native Hawaiians are publicly educated by the Hawaiʻi State Department of Education, an ethnically diverse school system that is the United States' largest and most centralized. Hawaiʻi is the only U.S. state without local community control of public schools.\n\nUnder the administration of Governor Benjamin J. Cayetano from 1994 to 2002, the state's educational system established special Hawaiian language immersion schools. In these schools, all subject courses are taught in the Hawaiian language and use native Hawaiian subject matter in curricula. These schools were created in the spirit of cultural preservation and are not exclusive to native Hawaiian children.\n\nNative Hawaiians are eligible for an education from the Kamehameha Schools, established through the last will and testament of Bernice Pauahi Bishop of the Kamehameha Dynasty. The largest and wealthiest private school in the United States, Kamehameha Schools was intended to benefit indigents and orphans, with preference given to native Hawaiians. The Kamehameha Schools provides a quality education to thousands of children of whole and part native Hawaiian ancestry at its campuses during the regular school year, and also has quality summer and off-campus programs that are not restricted by ancestry. Kamehameha Schools' practice of accepting primarily gifted students, in lieu of intellectually challenged children, has been a controversial topic amongst the native Hawaiian community. Many 'rejected' families feel that the gifted students could excel at any learning institution, public or private. Thus, the Hawaiian community may be better served by educating children from high-risk, high-crime districts so that a greater proportion of disadvantaged youths may grow up to be responsible community contributors.\n\nAs with other children in Hawaiʻi, some native Hawaiians are educated by other prominent private academies in the Aloha State. They include: Punahou School, Saint Louis School, Mid-Pacific Institute, and Iolani School.\n\nNative Hawaiians exemplify patterns of Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI), a model that captures seven interrelated descriptions, or facets, of learning found in Indigenous communities in the Americas. Native Hawaiian views on learning flow from three basic tenets that correspond directly to the LOPI model: “\"I ka nānā no a ʻike\": by observing, one learns. \"I ka hoʻolohe no a hoʻomaopopo:\" by listening, one commits to memory. \"I ka hana no a ʻike\": by practice one masters the skill.” \n\nLearner Incorporated and Contributing\n\nSimilar to the Indigenous communities of the Americas, Native Hawaiian children enthusiastically contribute alongside the adults, and the adult's presence is there to offer support. In most Native Hawaiian communities, household work tasks, such as ironing and cooking, etc., play a major role in contributing to the home life and children’s participation enhances their importance within the family. Native Hawaiian children have shared aspirations to accomplish collaborative tasks, and they individually take initiative to work together. Children absorb very early the community-wide belief that \"hana\" (work) is respected and laziness is shameful. The phrase “\"E hoʻohuli ka lima i lalo\"” (The palms of the hands should be turned down) was used to communicate the idea that idleness (associated with upturned palms) was to be avoided.\n\nCollaborative and Flexible Ensembles\n\nNative Hawaiian children cooperate with flexible leadership to combine their skills, ideas, and abilities, like that found in Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI) in the Indigenous Communities of the Americas. Family organization is a “shared-function” system that includes flexible roles and fluid responsibility within the group. Basic family values include interdependence, responsibility for others, sharing of work and resources, obedience, and respect. Children assume important family responsibilities early and act as members of a sibling workforce that is held collectively responsible for completing tasks.\n\nChildren also take initiative to help others in the classroom. It has been observed that when children are working in a group with their peers and face difficulty, they will scan the room for an adult to assist or turn to their close fellows to either ask for help. Children also scan to provide help to others when necessary. In this way, children shift between the roles of assisted and assistant. Adults were present and available, but the children were more often found to take the initiative to learn from, and teach, one another how to perform tasks such as sweeping, homework, and caring for younger siblings.\n\nLearning to Transform Participation\n\nAmong Native Hawaiians, the goal of learning is to transform participation to encompass conscientious accountability as active contributing members of the community, like that found in LOPI. For example, in some Native Hawaiian communities, parent(s) teach the older siblings the necessary skills of care taking. Sibling care-taking skills can relate to Indigenous American ways of learning by the children becoming considerate of their parents and taking on the responsibility when needed in case of a tragic incident with the parents. Within the classroom and home settings, adults are present but are not always directly monitoring the children. Children ask for help when necessary, but adults appear to rarely interject. Children appeared to adapt to tasks and situations by observations and go off on their own to collectively work out how and what to do to complete the task.\n\nAssuming and initiating care has been found across Polynesian cultures, and Native Hawaiian practices are in keeping with this trend. One study observed, interviewed, and evaluated families on the Polynesian Island Sikaiana and found that fostering children from other families within the community is a common shared endeavor that serves to construct relationships, support the community, and nurture compassion and sympathy (\"aloha\"). As children mature within the family, they go through a process of having their needs attended and learn to provide and care for the younger children alongside the adults. Adolescent girls who are active caretakers are referred to as parents, even if there is no biological connection.\n\nWide and Keen Attention for Contribution\n\nThe Hawaiians’ ways of learning include wide keen attention from the children while adults are available for guidance, also found in the model of Learning by Observing and Pitching In. Children were found to learn from adults by participating in group activities where they had the chance to observe the performance of more experienced participants as well as having errors in their own performance corrected by more seasoned group members. Because the children learn through observation, and then are encouraged to practice among their peers, we can speculate the children have keen attention to events around them, which is an expectation of adults and community members who are there to assist when needed. It has been observed that Hawaiian children were successful at completing tasks which greatly depend on visual and memory process skills, which coincides with Hawaiian mother’s frequent use of non-verbal communication.\n\nCoordination Through Shared Reference\n\nIn some Native Hawaiian communities, there is a constant use of “talk story” which plays an essential role in promoting solidarity in the community by not overpowering or making the members of the community feel inadequate for not understanding something. Talk story can consist of recalled events, folktales, and joking. Joking can be used to tease and guide the children about how to do a chore better or to avoid serious trouble. Talk story relates to an Indigenous way of learning by providing conversations such as narratives and dramatizations with verbal and nonverbal communication between the elder and children.\n\nAnother example of verbal communication in the Native Hawaiian culture is through the use of chanting, which can allow a child to understand the relationship of their present experiences to those of their ancestors, both alive and deceased. Chanting also allows children to understand the connections of their chants to mother earth. For instance, chanting can voice the need for rain to produce plants and induce ponds to grow fish for harvest.\n\nA study comparing Midwestern and Hawaiian mother – Kindergartener pairs presented with a novel task, found Hawaiian mothers to be much lower than their Midwestern counterparts in the use of verbal-control techniques and much higher in non-verbal communication, a finding which implies coordination through non-verbal and verbal means. Aspects of togetherness, continuity, purpose, and significance are a part of learning and coincide with the Native Hawaiian’s spiritual connection to earth and environment.\n\nFeedback That Appraises Mastery and Support for Learning\n\nThere is verbal and nonverbal guidance from parents to children with chores and other activities. For example, a pat on the shoulder can communicate to the child that he/she is doing the activity at hand the correct way. This example relates to the LOPI model by there being an appraisal from the parent(s) in order to support their progress in learning and contributing better in the community. As the child gradually advances towards more complex tasks, the goal of mastery and feedback on the adequacy of their contributions become more pronounced.\n\nIn the context of producing objects e.g. baskets, mats, or quilts, there was a belief that a child must produce a perfect end-product before moving on to learn the skills of producing something else. Perfection in these products was judged by more experienced craftspeople and was attained by repeated attempts interspersed with feedback. The perfected final products were kept as a special reminder and never used. Their production was seen as a necessary first step in “clearing the way” for other products to come; an indication of mastery for that skill set. Throughout several research articles, it becomes clear that many of the Native Hawaiian ways of learning resemble the defining characteristics of LOPI, which is common in many Indigenous communities of the Americas.\n\nNative Hawaiian culture has seen a revival in recent years as an outgrowth of decisions made at the 1978 Hawaiʻi State Constitutional Convention, held 200 years after the arrival of Captain Cook. At the convention, the Hawaiʻi state government committed itself to a progressive study and preservation of native Hawaiian culture, history, and language.\n\nA comprehensive Hawaiian culture curriculum was introduced into the State of Hawaiʻi's public elementary schools teaching: ancient Hawaiian art, lifestyle, geography, hula, and Hawaiian language vocabulary. Intermediate and high schools were mandated to impose two sets of Hawaiian history curricula on every candidate for graduation.\n\nStatutes and charter amendments were passed acknowledging a policy of preference for Hawaiian place and street names. For example, with the closure of Barbers Point Naval Air Station in the 1990s, the region formerly occupied by the base was renamed Kalaeloa.\n\nAnother important outgrowth of the 1978 Hawaiʻi State Constitutional Convention was the establishment of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, more popularly known as OHA. Delegates that included future Hawaiʻi political stars Benjamin J. Cayetano, John D. Waihee III, and Jeremy Harris enacted measures intended to address injustices toward native Hawaiians since the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in 1893. OHA was established as a trust, administered with a mandate to better the conditions of both native Hawaiians and the Hawaiian community in general. OHA was given control over certain public lands, and continues to expand its land-holdings to this day (most recently with Waimea Valley, previously Waimea Falls Park).\n\nBesides purchases since its inception, the lands initially given to OHA were originally crown lands of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi used to pay the expenses of the monarchy (later held by the Provisional Government following the fall of the monarchy in 1893). Upon the declaration of the Republic of Hawaiʻi, they were officially designated as public lands. They were ceded to federal control with the establishment of the Territory of Hawaiʻi in 1898, and finally returned to the State of Hawaiʻi as public lands in 1959.\n\nOHA is a semi-autonomous government body administered by a nine-member board of trustees, elected by the people of the State of Hawaiʻi through popular suffrage. Originally, trustees and the people eligible to vote for trustees were restricted to native Hawaiians. Rice v. Cayetano—suing the state to allow non-Hawaiians to sit on the board of trustees, and for non-Hawaiians to be allowed to vote in trustee elections—reached the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of Rice on February 23, 2000, forcing OHA to open its elections to all residents of the State of Hawaiʻi, regardless of ethnicity.\n\nIn 1974, the Native American Programs Act was amended to include native Hawaiians. This paved the way for native Hawaiians to become eligible for some, but not all, federal assistance programs originally intended for Continental Native Americans. Today, Title 45 CFR Part 1336.62 defines a Native Hawaiian as \"an individual any of whose ancestors were natives of the area which consists of the Hawaiian Islands prior to 1778\".\n\nThere is some controversy as to whether or not native Hawaiians should be considered in the same light as Native Americans.\n\nOn November 23, 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed United States Public Law 103-150, also known as the Apology Resolution, which had previously passed Congress. This resolution \"apologizes to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the people of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii\".\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Congressional delegation of the State of Hawaiʻi introduced the Native Hawaiian Federal Recognition Bill, beginning the process of recognizing and forming a Native Hawaiian government entity to negotiate with state and federal governments. The significance of the bill is that it would establish, for the first time in the history of the islands, a new political and legal relationship between a Native Hawaiian entity and the federal government. This Native Hawaiian entity would be a newly created one without any historical precedent in the islands, or direct institutional continuity with previous political entities (unlike many Native American Indian groups, for example).\n\nThis bill came under scrutiny by the Bush administration's Department of Justice, as well as the United States Senate Judiciary Committee. The political context surrounding the Akaka Bill is both controversial and complex. Proponents, who consider the legislation an acknowledgement and partial correction of past injustices, include Hawaiʻi's Congressional delegation, as well as the former Republican Governor, Linda Lingle. Opponents include the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, (who question the constitutionality of creating race-based governments), libertarian activists, (who challenge the historical accuracy of any claims of injustice), and other Native Hawaiian sovereignty activists, (who feel the legislation would thwart their hopes for complete independence from the United States).\n\nA Ward Research poll commissioned in 2003 by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs reported that \"Eighty-six percent of the 303 Hawaiian residents polled by Ward Research said 'yes.' Only 7 percent said 'no,' with 6 percent unsure ... Of the 301 non-Hawaiians polled, almost eight in 10 (78 percent) supported federal recognition, 16 percent opposed it, with 6 percent unsure.\" A Zogby International poll commissioned in 2009 by the Grassroot Institute of Hawaii indicated that a plurality (39%) of Hawaiʻi residents opposed the Native Hawaiian Reorganization Act of 2009, and that 76% indicated that they were unwilling to pay higher taxes to cover any loss in tax revenues that might be incurred by the act.\n\nIn 2005, with the support of Senator Daniel Inouye, federal funding through the Native Hawaiian Education Act created the Center for Excellence in Native Hawaiian Law at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa's William S. Richardson School of Law. A few years later, the program became known as Ka Huli Ao: Center for Excellence in Native Hawaiian Law. The inaugural director of Ka Huli Ao is Honolulu attorney Melody Kapilialoha MacKenzie. MacKenzie is also recognized as the chief editor of the Native Hawaiian Rights Handbook, which is a legal publication that describes Native Hawaiian law, a subset of laws of the State of Hawaiʻi. MacKenzie worked as a clerk to the school of lawʻs namesake, William S. Richardson, for four years, and also served as the Executive Director of the Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation for four years, then worked as a senior staff attorney for another six years.\n\nKa Huli Ao focuses on research, scholarship, and community outreach. Ka Huli Ao provides a monthly lunch-time discussion forum referred to as \"Maoli Thursday\", which is free and open to the public. Ka Huli Ao maintains its own blog, as well as a Twitter account and a Facebook group. Ka Huli Ao also provides law students with summer fellowships. Law school graduates are eligible to apply for post-J.D. fellowships that last for one year.\n\nIn 1873 the first native Hawaiian's were given permission from King Lunalilo (prior emigration of native Hawaiians was not allowed) to permanently emigrate to the United States (Salt Lake City, Utah) whose names were Kiha Kaawa, and Kahana Pukahi. Kiha was adopted by Mormon Missionary President George Nebeker immediately upon arrival making Kiha Kaawa(Nebeker) the first native Hawaiian to become a US citizen in 1873.\n\nSeveral cultural preservation societies and organizations have been established over the course of the twentieth century. The largest of those institutions is the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, established in 1889 and designated as the Hawaiʻi State Museum of Natural and Cultural History. Bishop Museum houses the largest collection of native Hawaiian artifacts, documents, and other information available for educational use. Most objects are held for preservation alone. The museum has links with major colleges and universities throughout the world to facilitate research.\n\nWith the support of the Bishop Museum, the Polynesian Voyaging Society's double-hulled canoe, \"Hōkūle‘a\", has contributed to rediscovery of native Hawaiian culture, especially in the revival of non-instrument navigation, by which ancient Polynesians originally settled Hawaiʻi.\nOne of the most commonly known arts of Hawaii is hula dancing. It is an interpretive dance, famous for its grace and romantic feel, that expresses stories and feelings from almost any phase of life.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3295963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3295963", "title": "Objet petit a", "text": "Objet petit a\n\nIn the psychoanalytic theory of Jacques Lacan, objet petit a stands for the unattainable object of desire. It is sometimes called the object cause of desire. Lacan always insisted that the term should remain untranslated, \"thus acquiring the status of an algebraic sign\" (\"Écrits\").\n\n'The \"a\" in question stands for \"autre\" (other), the concept having been developed out of the Freudian \"object\" and Lacan's own exploitation of \"otherness.\" \n\nJacques-Alain Miller pointed to the origins of object (a) in Freud's 'lost object...the function that Freud discovered in the \"Three Essays\"...and that Karl Abraham made the crux of his theory of development from which he derived the first premises of the \"partial object\"'.\n\nThereafter, according to Miller, Melanie Klein 'located the partial object at the centre of psychic economy...hence it was that Winnicott glimpsed the transitional object.' That long prehistory of object relations 'is what Lacan sums up, condenses, justifies and constructs with object \"a\".' \n\n'In Lacan's seminars of the late 1950s and early 1960s, the evolving concept of the \"objet (petit) a\" is viewed in the \"matheme\" of phantasy as the object of desire sought in the other...a deliberate departure from British Object Relations psychoanalysis'.\n\nIn 1957, in his Seminar \"Les formations de l'inconscient\", Lacan introduces the concept of \"objet petit a\" as the (Kleinian) imaginary part-object, an element which is imagined as separable from the rest of the body. In the Seminar \"Le transfert\" (1960–1961) he articulates objet a with the term \"agalma\" (Greek, an ornament). Just as the \"agalma\" is a precious object hidden in a worthless box, so \"objet petit a\" is the object of desire which we seek in the Other. The \"box\" can take many forms, all of which are unimportant, the importance lies in what is \"inside\" the box, the cause of desire.\n\nIn the Seminars \"L'angoisse\" (1962–1963) and The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis (1964), \"objet petit a\" is defined as the leftover, the remnant left behind by the introduction of the Symbolic in the Real. This is further elaborated in the Seminar \"The Other Side of Psychoanalysis\" (1969–1970), where Lacan elaborates his Four discourses. In the discourse of the Master, one signifier attempts to represent the subject for all other signifiers, but a surplus is always produced: this surplus is \"objet petit a\", a surplus meaning, a surplus of jouissance.\n\nSlavoj Žižek explains this \"objet petit a\" in relation to Alfred Hitchcock's MacGuffin: \"[The] MacGuffin is \"objet petit a\" pure and simple: the lack, the remainder of the Real that sets in motion the symbolic movement of interpretation, a hole at the center of the symbolic order, the mere appearance of some secret to be explained, interpreted, etc.\" (\"Love thy symptom as thyself\").\n\nSpeaking of the \"fall\" of the \"a\", Lacan noted that 'the diversity of forms taken by that object of the fall ought to be related to the manner in which the desire of the Other is apprehended by the subject.' The earliest form is 'something that is called the breast...this breast in its function as object, \"object a\" cause of desire.' \n\nNext there emerges 'the second form: the anal object. We know it by way of the phenomenology of the gift, the present offered in anxiety.' The third form appears 'at the level of the genital act...[where] Freudian teaching, and the tradition that has maintained it, situates for us the gaping chasm of castration.' \n\nLacan also identified 'the function of \"petit a\" at the level of the scopophilic drive. Its essence is realized in so far as, more than elsewhere, the subject is captive of the function of desire.' The final term relates to 'the \"petit a\" source of the superego...the fifth term of the function of \"petit a\", through which will be revealed the gamut of the object in its - pregenital - relation to the demand of the - post-genital - Other.' \n\nFor transference to take place, the analyst must incorporate the \"a\" for the analysand: 'analysts who are such only insofar as they are object - the object of the analysand'. For Lacan, 'it is not enough that the analyst should support the function of Tiresias. He must also, as Apollinaire tells us, have breasts' - must represent or incorporate the (missing) object of desire.\n\nWorking through the transference thereafter entails moving 'beyond the function of the \"a\"': the 'analyst has to...be the support of the separating \"a\",' so as to allow the analysis eventually to be completed. 'If the analyst during the analysis will come to be this object, he will also at the end of analysis not be it. He will submit himself to the fate of any object that stands in for \"a\", and that is to be discarded.' \n\n"}

{"id": "657258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=657258", "title": "Saint Vincent Panels", "text": "Saint Vincent Panels\n\nThe Saint Vincent Panels, or the \"Adoration of Saint Vincent\" panels, are a polyptych consisting of six panels that were perhaps painted in the 1450s. They are attributed to the Portuguese painter Nuno Gonçalves, who was active from 1450 to 1471. Traditionally, the polyptych is dated to the 1450s due to the putative prominence of Prince Henry the Navigator among the persons represented in the panels (Henry died in 1460). Controversy concerning the true nature of Henry's presence in the panels - if any - along with the inclusion of figures that can be identified as his brothers, all of whom died before 1450, renders it difficult to assign any secure date for the creation of the panels other than sometime during the \"floruit\" of the painter Gonçalves.\n\nThe original retable, during its stay in the Cathedral of Lisbon, contained \"over twelve\" panels, as a source from 1767 states. They were displayed in the cathedral at least until 1690 and were set aside in the cathedral until 1742. They were then transferred to the palace of Mitra, where they escaped the devastating earthquake of Lisbon in 1755.\n\nThe panels are now housed in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga (National Museum of Antique Art), in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nFound during the late 1880s in the monastery of Saint Vicente de Fora in Lisbon, the panels depict scenes associated with the veneration of Saint Vincent of Saragossa. This polyptych consists of six separate panels of oak painted with oil or tempera.\n\nThe only reference that art historians can use to support the attribution of the creation of the panels to the painter Gonçalves was written in the 16th century by Francisco de Holanda. The reference mentions a great work of art made by him that is inferred to be these panels. There has also been speculation that the father of Hugo van der Goes collaborated in the painting of the panels, but no firm evidence to support this hypothesis exists. In any case, the \"Saint Vincent Panels\" are regarded as the greatest achievement of pre-modern Portuguese art.\n\nSince their discovery in the late 19th century, there has been a continuing dispute over the identity of the painter and the subjects portrayed on the panels. Some basic questions, still unanswered, are these:\n\n\nThe majority of experts who have studied this polyptych agree that the panels display several social groups of 15th-century Portugal. They also agree that the children of King John I are represented on these panels, but there is disagreement about their placement and identity. \n\nOne of the more controversial issues concerning the panels is the depiction of Prince Henry the Navigator. At first glance, the appearance of the man in black in the third panel is quite compatible with traditional conceptions of Prince Henry's likeness: a man with a light moustache and distinctive black round chaperon such as can be found in numerous representations today. However, there are strong reasons to doubt that this is him.\nThe most basic problem in identifying the man-in-the-chaperon in the Saint Vincent Panels derives from the lack of confirmed portraits of Prince Henry that date from his lifetime. The only other 15th-century image of the man-in-the-chaperon is found in the frontispiece of a copy (currently held by the Bibliothèque nationale de France) of Gomes Eanes de Zurara's \"Crónicas dos Feitos de Guiné\", written in 1453. Zurara's book is an account of the early Portuguese discoveries in Africa along with a hagiography of Prince Henry, to whom the author assigned singular credit for the discoveries. As a result, it has been assumed that the frontispiece depicts Henry, especially since the motto underneath it seems to have been Henry's own.\nOne alternative hypothesis postulates that the man-in-the-chaperon in Zurara's book might actually be King Edward of Portugal (r. 1431-38), Prince Henry's brother. It has been pointed out that critical phases of the discoveries were launched during his reign, and it would not be unusual for a portrait of a king to adorn a chronicle of events that occurred during his reign.\n\nThis alternative hypothesis can be used to help clarify the identity of the figures surrounding St. Vincent in the Panel of the Prince. Specifically, it offers an explanation for the symmetrical arrangement of men and women as pairings of kings and queens. In this interpretation, the standing pair would be King Edward (in a black chaperon), standing at the right and balanced on the left by his wife, Queen Eleanor of Aragon. Below them would be their son, King Afonso V of Portugal, kneeling on the right and facing his consort, Queen Isabella of Coimbra, who is kneeling on the left. The boy in the panel would then be Edward's heir, the future King John II of Portugal.\n\nThis alternative hypothesis seems more logical than the original hypothesis that insists on identifying the man-in-the-chaperon as Prince Henry. Since Henry was a bachelor, it is not obvious what woman would be suitable to pair with him as the standing figure on the left. His closest female relatives were his mother Philippa and sister, Isabella, Duchess of Burgundy, both of whom would be more properly paired with their husbands. Moreover, Isabella did not live in Portugal after 1430, thus her lack of involvement with Portuguese society at the time the panel was painted would probably disqualify her from inclusion. If the uncle of a king were to be incorporated in the panel, it would more properly be Peter, Duke of Coimbra, who was once the regent of Afonso V and the father of his bride.\n\nAnother interpretation of the figures includes Henry in the panel, but proposes Edward as the kneeling king and Afonso V as the boy. Regardless, all traditional means of explaining Henry's presence in the panel strike one as forced, formulated simply to accommodate a preconceived notion that Henry must be the man-in-the-chaperon. Since Edward was the brother of Henry, it is perfectly possible that he bore a close enough resemblance to Henry that the traditional identification in the Zurara book is perfectly correct, and that Edward's appearance in the panel is only coincidentally similar to what is depicted for Henry in the Zurara book.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis with King Edward as the man-in-the-chaperon is more logical; pairs of kings and queens are all that are featured in the panel, with no intrusion from other family members, except for the minor son of one of the royal pairs. Other relatives are featured in a panel of their own (see below). In consideration of this, the Panel of the Prince perhaps ought to be called the Panel of Kings instead, with the king intended to be featured most prominently apparently Afonso V, who was the reigning king of Portugal throughout the \"floruit\" of Nuno Gonçalves, thus the most likely candidate as patron for the preparation of the panels.\n\nHypotheses that assert Henry the Navigator is not the man-in-the-chaperon identify him in another panel: the fifth panel known as the \"Panel of the Knights\". This alternative interpretation posits that the four knights featured in the panel are the four younger brothers of King Edward of Portugal, as follows:\n\nThere has also been much discussion around the possible political significances of this panel. It seems, in particular, that by the poses, this panel aims to humiliate Henry the Navigator, possibly for allying himself with Afonso of Braganza against his full brother Peter, Duke of Coimbra, in the Battle of Alfarrobeira in 1449. These features of the portrait have been noted: \n\nIt is worth remarking that the colors chosen for the princes seem to match the liturgical colors of the Roman rite—black (Ferdinand) for mourning of the dead, green (Peter) for ordinary, red (John) for passion and sacrifice and purple (Henry) for penance and mortification.\n\nIf this interpretation is valid, then the polyptych of St. Vincent may very well have been conceived by Nuno Gonçalves as a piece of anti-Braganza political propaganda, one possible reason it might have remained hidden for years. It would also set up a \"terminus post quem\" for the creation of the panels; they would have to have been painted after 1449 (the date of the Battle of Alfarrobeira). That would tend to support the traditional belief that they date from the 1450s (when passions left over from that conflict would still have been fresh), however if the boy depicted in the Panel of the Prince can be identified as the future King John II (b. 1455), his height and appearance would certainly indicate a child older than five years' old, thus a date in the 1460s would be more likely.\n\n"}

{"id": "7761118", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7761118", "title": "Singerie", "text": "Singerie\n\nSingerie is the name given to a visual arts genre depicting monkeys imitating human behavior, often fashionably attired, intended as a diverting sight, always with a gentle cast of mild satire. The term is derived from the French word for \"Monkey Trick\".\n\nThe practise can be traced as far back as Ancient Egypt; Cyril Aldred detected a love of \"singerie\" that he found characteristic of the late Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt; Throughout the medieval period in Europe, monkeys were seen \"as a symbol of downgraded humanity\", and were used to mimic man and his foibles, often appearing in the margins of illuminated manuscripts.\n\nComical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment originated as a pictorial genre in Flemish painting in the 16th century and were further developed in the 17th century. The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which are strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists, in particular by those in Antwerp such as Frans Francken the Younger, Jan Brueghel the Elder and the Younger, Sebastiaen Vrancx and Jan van Kessel the Elder. David Teniers the Younger became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. The two brothers were able to cater to the prevailing taste in the art market and were thus instrumental in spreading the genre outside Flanders. Later in the 17th century artists like Nicolaes van Verendael, principally known as a painter of flower still lifes started to paint ‘monkey scenes’ as well.\n\"Singeries\" became popular among French artists in the early 18th century. French decorator and designer Jean Berain the Elder included dressed figures of monkeys in many wall decorations, the great royal \"ébéniste\" André Charles Boulle used them in his work and Watteau painted \"The Monkey Sculptor\", a critique of art and artists' habit of \"aping\" nature.\n\nA complete monkey orchestra was produced in Meissen porcelain. In France the most famous such rococo decor are Christophe Huet's \"Grande Singerie\" and \"Petite Singerie\" decors at the Château de Chantilly; in England the French painter Andieu de Clermont is also known for his \"singeries\": the most famous decorates the ceiling of the Monkey Room at Monkey Island Hotel, located on Monkey Island in Bray-on-Thames, England. The Grade I listed buildings, which have housed guests since 1840 were built in the 1740s by Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough.\nSingeries regained popularity in the 19th century and artists then successful in this genre included Zacharie Noterman, Emmanuel Noterman, Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, Edmund Bristow, Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps, Charles Monginot and Paul Friedrich Meyerheim.\n\n"}

The Trust was founded in 1965.\n\nThe Trust is a registered charity that supports restoration campaigns and projects.\n\nThe Trust also offers legal and technical advice to conservation groups and bodies such as Heritage Link, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the UK Government. It presents annual restoration awards and has a particular mission to encourage young people to take part in restoration projects. The Trust's Patron is Prince Michael of Kent.\n\nThe Heritage Lottery Fund commissioned the Transport Trust to assess pressures on the transport heritage movement, and the state of artefacts and locations to help them prioritise applications for funding support. The resulting 145 page report, Transport Heritage: An Assessment of Needs & Potential', provides a unique snapshot of the health of the transport preservation movement in Britain. The movement is important, touching people at many levels and has a wide appeal - it is estimated that audiences and participants in heritage transport activities exceed 15 million people a year, making it one of Britain's most important leisure activities. Britain's particularly rich transport history has no doubt played a catalytic role to build up this level of grass roots participation. \n\nSurprisingly, although there are good collections of artefacts in public sector museums, it is the private sector preservationists that have made the most significant contribution to conservation and to the provision of the active enjoyment of transport by the public. A supreme example is the restoration to flight status of Avro Vulcan XH558, which represents the most complex restoration project ever undertaken globally, was funded entirely by public donations and for which the Chief Executive of the Vulcan To The Sky Trust, Dr Robert Pleming, was presented the Transport Trust Preservationist of The Year award by Prince Michael of Kent.\n\nThe key conclusions for each major transport area were:\n\nThe widespread preservation of aircraft in the UK began in the 1960s when a large number of obsolete military aircraft became available. A push to co-ordinate the movement led to founding of the British Aviation Preservation Council (BAPC) in 1967, but very few private collections are represented. Although over 2,500 aircraft survive and are capable of preservation, little progress has been made to develop a clear preservation strategy, with 4% of the highest graded and as many as 26% of the second kept outside. Historically, insufficient attention has also been paid to preserving airfield architecture, although the designation in 2007 of Duxford Aerodrome as a Conservation Area will help preserve a virtually intact site, first established as a Royal Flying Corps base in 1916 and fully operational as an RAF base until 1961. This Battle of Britain airfield, home to Douglas Bader's Big Wing experiments and the first RAF base to receive the Supermarine Spitfire, now houses the Imperial War Museum Duxford, the largest centre of European aviation history and home to the largest collection of American aircraft outside of the US.\n\nThe key needs for the aviation category are to prioritise individual aircraft for preservation; to move middle grade airframes into hangarage; to pay greater attention to civil aircraft; to deal with pressing gaps in conservation skills.\n\nThere are about 4,000 buses and coaches in preservation of which some 45% are in a recognised collection or museum, private or public, but less than 30% are restored. Most in museums are from the 1950s and 1960s, with only 10% from before 1940, but\nover 80% of the total are owned by private individuals - with little support they have been responsible for the majority of bus conservation. Little progress has been made in prioritising this assortment, which is scattered all over the country, with some concentration in the cities.\n\nThe key needs for the bus and coach category are the completion of a category register of preserved buses as a prelude to\nintroducing a grading system; a strategy for accommodating at least the most important vehicles under cover (presently 50% of all preserved buses are stored in the open); the conservation of the most important vehicles; facilities for improved public access and education; an archive of papers, ephemera and small artefacts which might otherwise disappear.\n\nWith over 400 miles of track, nearly 600 stations and about 150 locations around the country, heritage railways and the items in museums represent a big investment. Amassing a combined annual turnover in excess of £30 million and around 9 million passengers a year, they form a prime element of the British leisure industry. Incredibly, over 1,000 steam engines survive, though less than 20% are operable at any one time due to the high cost of overhaul. In addition, over 700 diesel locomotives and about 150 passenger units are in preservation together with a regrettably small number of electric units. Over 3,000 passenger carriages and 2,500 freight vehicles are also held in various states of conservation. The Heritage Railway Association provides support and advice to heritage lines. The busiest heritage line in Britain is the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, which operates over 100 days a year over the bulk of the 24 mile trackbed constructed by George Stephenson and which opened in 1836.\n\nThe key needs for the railways category are a grading system for vehicles and lines to focus funding on the most worthy; safe access for the public to workshops and sheds to increase visitor appeal; covered accommodation for both restoration work and carriage storage; a concerted effort to conserve electric trains; support for private enthusiast restoration projects to increase capacity; archive storage to minimise losses of priceless records.\n\nThis diverse and scattered category is highly dependent on private individuals. Only canal and inland waterways craft have a degree of structure, largely because of their links with the waterways. Others such as fishing boats, lifeboats and traditional river craft are found all round the UK. In museums smaller vessels are typically overshadowed by larger ones. Steam has a strong following. Most boats are privately owned and the majority are sailable. There are probably about 500 small boats of major historical importance which should be preserved - their interests are managed by a plethora of ‘umbrella’ organisations, to which the National Maritime Museum is attempting to bring a degree of co-ordination. The National Small Boat Register, managed by the National Maritime Museum Cornwall, maintains listings of over 1,200 small craft (under 12m/40 ft) that embrace rarity, historic and cultural value. The Advisory Committee for National Historic Ships maintains a register of larger historic vessels [over 10.1m/33 ft] that have demonstrably strong UK associations.\n\nThe key needs for the maritime category are a common grading system across the category is needed in order to prioritise\nconservation efforts; the preservation of the 500 small craft of significant heritage importance could be enhanced by relatively modest supporting sums; more training in traditional skills; safe storage where boats at risk could be placed pending restoration.\n\nDespite the rich diversity of Britain's transport heritage, there are many common threads. Strategic leadership and vision is vital and umbrella organisations can play a vital role. Undercover storage is also critical for artefacts that have long exceeded their envisaged working lives. And, finally, since transport is appreciated most when used, many irreplaceable historical relics are wearing out and should be replaced by working replicas.\n\nThe Trust runs a scheme that creates and places Red Wheel transport heritage plaques on especially important and unusual sites of transport heritage.\nThe Trust is open to nominations for Red Wheel plaques at sites which would otherwise be ignored or their value under appreciated by members of the public.\nTo nominate a site the Trust has an online proposal process on their website \n\n"}

The actual bookbinding technique is the same as for other medieval books, with the folios, normally of vellum, stitched together and bound to wooden cover boards. The metal furnishings of the treasure binding are then fixed, normally by tacks, onto these boards. Treasure bindings appear to have existed from at least Late Antiquity, though there are no surviving examples from so early, and Early Medieval examples are very rare. They were less used by the end of the Middle Ages, but a few continued to be produced in the West even up to the present day, and many more in areas where Eastern Orthodoxy predominated. The bindings were mainly used on grand illuminated manuscripts, especially Gospel books designed for the altar and use in church services, rather than study in the library.\n\nThe vast majority of these bookbindings were later destroyed as their valuable gold and jewels were removed by looters, or the owners when in need of cash. Others survive without their jewels, and many are either no longer attached to a book, or have been moved to a different book. Some survive in major libraries - for example the Morgan Library in New York City, the John Rylands Library in Manchester, the British Library in London and the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. As the carved ivory reliefs often used could not usually be recycled, these survive in much larger numbers, giving a better idea of the numbers of treasure bindings that once existed. Other examples are recorded in documentary sources but though the books survive the covers do not. The Book of Kells lost its binding after a robbery, and the fate of the missing cover of the Book of Lindisfarne is not recorded.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox churches treasure bindings have continued to be produced, mainly for liturgical Gospel books, up to the present day, and exist in many different artistic styles. Other styles of binding using gems, and typically pearls, have a covering of velvet or other textile, to which the gems are sewn or otherwise fixed. These were more likely to be for the private books of a grand person, especially the prayer books and books of hours of female royalty, and may also include embroidery.\n\nThe techniques for producing jewelled bookbinding have evolved over the course of history with the technologies and methods used in creating books. During the fourth century of the Christian era, manuscripts on papyrus or vellum scrolls first became flattened and turned into books with cut pages tied together through holes punched in their margins. Beginning in the fifth century, books were sewn together in this manner using leather thongs to make the bind stronger and longer lasting with wooden boards placed on top and bottom to keep the pages flat. These thongs then came to be laced into the boards and covered entirely by leather.\n\nBoards afforded the opportunity for decorative ornamentation, with metal casings set into the wood for the installation of precious gems, stones, and jewels. The cover material would then be laid over the casings by hand and cut around the rim of the casings to reveal the jewels. The books typically bound were Gospels and other religious books made for use within the church. In the Middle Ages, the responsibility of creating adorned books went to metalworkers and guilders, not the bookbinders, who worked with sheets of gold, silver, or copper to create jewelled and enamelled panels that were nailed separately into the wooden boards.\n\nMetalwork book furniture also included metal clasps holding the book shut when not in use, and isolated metal elements decorating a leather or cloth cover, which were very common in grander libraries in the later Middle Ages. Decorative book clasps or straps were made with jewels or repoussé metal from the 12th century onward, particularly in Holland and Germany. In Scotland and Ireland from the ninth century or earlier, books that were regarded as relics of monastic leaders were enshrined in a decorated metal reliquary box called a cumdach, and thereafter were probably not used as books. These were even carried into battle as a kind of standard, worn around the neck by a soldier like a protective amulet. Jewelled slipcases or boxes were also used to house small editions of the Qur’an during this time period.\n\nIn fashion in the 16th century were 'books of golde': small, devotional books adorned with jewelled or enamelled covers worn as a girdle or around the neck like pieces of jewellery by the English court. These pieces can be seen in portraits from the period and records of jewels from the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI.\n\nTreasure bindings were a luxury affordable only by wealthy elites, and were commissioned by wealthy private collectors, churches and senior clergy and royalty, and were often commissioned for presentation by or to royal or noble persons. The earliest reference to them is in a letter of Saint Jerome of 384, where he \"writes scornfully of the wealthy Christian women whose books are written in gold on purple vellum, and clothed with gems...\". From at least the 6th century they are seen in mosaics and other images, such as the 6th century icon of Christ Pantocrator from Saint Catherine's Monastery and the famous mosaic of Justinian I in the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna. The ivory panels often placed in the centre of covers were adapted from the style of consular diptychs, and indeed a large proportion of surviving examples of those were reused on book covers in the Middle Ages. Some bindings were created to contain relics of saints, and these large books were sometimes seen suspended from golden rods and carried in the public processions of Byzantine emperors. Especially in the Celtic Christianity of Ireland and Britain, relatively ordinary books that had belonged to monastic saints became treated as relics, and might be rebound with a treasure binding, or placed in a cumdach.\n\nThe gems and gold do not merely create an impression of richness, though that was certainly part of their purpose, but served both to offer a foretaste of the bejewelled nature of the Celestial city in religious contexts, and particular types of gem were believed to have actual powerful properties in various \"scientific\", medical and magical respects, as set out in the popular lapidary books. Several liturgical books given rich bindings can be shown by textual analysis to lack essential parts of the normal textual apparatus of a \"working\" version of their text, like the Book of Kells and the Codex Aureus of Echternach. They may have been used for readings at services, but in a monastery were essentially part of the furnishings of the church rather than the library; as records from the Abbey of Kells show, the book of Kells lived in the sacristry.\n\nByzantine and Western medieval treasure bindings are often not entirely unified in style. Apart from being completed at different times, and sometimes in different countries, elements were also removed and readapted for other volumes or reset with new pieces as time passed. For example, the covers now on the Lindau Gospels come from different parts of South Germany, with the lower or back cover created in the eighth century (earlier than the book they now adorn) while the upper or front cover was completed in the ninth century; both incorporate gilded metal ornamented with jewels. It is not known when they were first used on this manuscript.\n\nOutside the monasteries, the emerging bookbinders’ guilds of the Middle Ages were often restricted by law with quantitative limitations on the application of jewels. Though this did not significantly affect the craft of decorating books, it did mandate the number of jewels allowed depending on the position or rank of the commissioner of the work. Hardly any early medieval English treasure bindings survived the dissolution of the monasteries and the English Reformation, when ecclesiastical libraries in England were rounded up and treasure bindings removed under an act to ‘to strip off and pay into the king’s treasury all gold and silver found on Popish books of devotion.’ Comparable depredations were not as thorough in the Continental Protestant Reformation, but most bindings survive from Catholic areas that avoided later war and revolutions.\n\nDespite the commoditisation of book production due to the printing press, the artistic tradition of jewelled bookbinding continued in England, though less frequently and often in simpler designs. Luxury bindings were still favoured by the English Court, which is evident from the records on the private library of Queen Elizabeth I, who favoured velvet bindings. On a visit to the Royal Library in 1598, Paul Hentzner remarked on the books ‘bound in velvet of different colours, though chiefly red, with clasps of gold and silver; some have pearls, and precious stones, set in their bindings.’ Throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the style evolved to be one using velvet, satin, silk, and canvas in bookbinding decorated less with jewels and more with embroidery, metal threads, pearls, and sequins.\n\nAfter jewelled bookbinding enjoyed its renaissance, the practice waned until it experienced a revival near the turn of the twentieth century in England. Highly influential in the revival of this style were Francis Sangorski and George Sutcliffe of the Sangorski & Sutcliffe bindery. Their bindings were not large uncut gems as in Mediaeval times, but semi-precious stones \"en cabochon\" set into beautifully designed bindings with multi-coloured leather inlays and elaborate gilt tooling. The craftsmanship of these bindings was unsurpassable; only their competitors Riviere produced work of similar quality. The most famous of these bindings is \"The Great Omar\" (1909) on a large copy of FitzGerald's \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\", which included good tooling, inlays of coloured leather, and 1050 jewels in a peacock design scheme. It went down with the \"Titanic\" in 1912. Today, a third reproduction of this binding is the only one to survive, after the second one, reproduced to Sutcliffe’s design by his nephew Stanley Bray, was damaged in the Blitz during World War II. Bray’s second attempt at recreating the design, the third version that survives, was placed in the British Library in 1989.\n\nOther binderies creating books in this style during this period were the companies of Rivière and Zaehnsdorf. The largest collection of these masterpieces was the Phoebe Boyle one; over 100 jewelled bindings were sold in 1923. Jewelled bindings occasionally appear at auction; literature on them is surprisingly scant given their superb quality.\n\nIn 1998, Rob Shepherd of Shepherds Bookbinders bought both Zaehnsdorf and Sangorski & Sutcliffe. Presently, binding with jewels is a rare practice, and binding companies both large and small are finding the art form becoming less viable in today’s society. Bindings that exist today are housed in private collections or can be found in libraries and museums across the world.\n\n\nThe links listed below can take you to some currently exhibited examples of jewelled bookbinding in museums and galleries. \n"}

It was sited in the southwest of the modern city of St Albans in Hertfordshire, Great Britain. A large portion of the Roman city remains unexcavated, being now park and agricultural land, though much has been built upon. The ancient Watling Street passed through the city. Much of the site and its environs is now classed as a scheduled ancient monument.\n\nBefore the Romans established their settlement, there was already a tribal centre in the area which belonged to the Catuvellauni. This settlement is usually called Verlamion. The etymology is uncertain but the name has been reconstructed as *\"Uerulāmion\", which would have a meaning like \"[the tribe or settlement] of the broad hand\" (\"Uerulāmos\") in Brittonic. In this pre-Roman form, it was among the first places in Britain recorded by name. The settlement was established by Tasciovanus, who minted coins there.\n\nThe Roman settlement was granted the rank of \"municipium\" around AD 50, meaning its citizens had what were known as \"Latin Rights\", a lesser citizenship status than a \"colonia\" possessed. It grew to a significant town, and as such received the attentions of Boudica of the Iceni in 61, when Verulamium was sacked and burnt on her orders: a black ash layer has been recorded by archaeologists, thus confirming the Roman written record. It grew steadily; by the early 3rd century, it covered an area of about , behind a deep ditch and wall. It is the location of the martyrdom of the first British martyr saint, Saint Alban, who was a Roman patrician converted by the priest Amphibalus.\n\nVerulamium contained a forum, basilica and a theatre, much of which were damaged during two fires, one in 155 and the other in around 250. One of the few extant Roman inscriptions in Britain is found on the remnants of the forum (see Verulamium Forum inscription). The town was rebuilt in stone rather than timber at least twice over the next 150 years. Occupation by the Romans ended between 400 and 450.\n\nThere are a few remains of the Roman city visible, such as parts of the city walls, a hypocaust still in situ under a mosaic floor, and the theatre, as well as items in the Museum (below). More remains under the nearby agricultural land which have never been excavated were for a while seriously threatened by deep ploughing.\n\nVerulamium is mentioned in a Latin inscription on a Wax tablet, dated to AD 62, discovered in London during the Bloomberg excavations, 2010-14:\n\nAlthough there are other Roman theatres in Britain (for example at Camulodunum), the one at Verulamium has been claimed to be the only example of its kind, being a theatre with a stage rather than an amphitheatre.\n\nSt Albans Abbey and the associated Anglo-Saxon settlement were founded on a hill outside the Roman city. The site of the abbey may have been a location where there was reason to believe that St Alban was executed or buried. More certainly, the abbey is near the site of a Roman cemetery, which, as was normal in Roman times, was outside the city walls. It is unknown whether there are Roman remains under the medieval abbey. An archaeological excavation in 1978, directed by Martin Biddle, failed to find Roman remains on the site of the medieval chapter house.\n\nDavid Nash Ford identifies the community as the (\"Fort Municipium\") listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Britain in his \"History of the Britains\". As late as the eighth century the Saxon inhabitants of St Albans nearby were aware of their ancient neighbour, which they knew alternatively as \"Verulamacæstir\" or, under what H. R. Loyn terms \"their own hybrid\", \"Vaeclingscæstir\", \"the fortress of the followers of Wæcla\", possibly a pocket of British-speakers remaining separate in an increasingly Saxonised area.\n\nThe city was quarried for building material for the construction of medieval St Albans; indeed, much of the Norman abbey was constructed from the remains of the Roman city, with Roman brick and stone visible. The modern city takes its name from Alban, either a citizen of \"Verulamium\" or a Roman soldier, who was condemned to death in the 3rd century for sheltering Amphibalus, a Christian. Alban was converted by him to Christianity, and by virtue of his death, Alban became the first British Christian martyr.\n\nSince much of the modern city and its environs is built over Roman remains, it is still common to unearth Roman artefacts several miles away. A complete tile kiln was found in Park Street some six miles (10 km) from Verulamium in the 1970s, and there is a Roman mausoleum near Rothamsted Park five miles (8 km) away.\n\nWithin the walls of ancient \"Verulamium\", the Elizabethan philosopher, essayist and statesman Sir Francis Bacon built a \"refined small house\" that was thoroughly described by the 17th century diarist John Aubrey. No trace of it is left, but Aubrey noted, \"At Verulam is to be seen, in some few places, some remains of the wall of this Citie\".\n\nMoreover, when Bacon was ennobled in 1618, he took the title Baron Verulam after \"Verulamium\". The barony became extinct after he died without heirs in 1626.\n\nThis title was revived in 1790 for James Grimston, a Hertfordshire politician. He was later made Earl of Verulam, a title still held by his descendants.\n\nThe Verulamium Museum is run by the district council in Verulamium Park (adjacent to St Michael's Church), which contains much information about the town, both as a Roman and Iron Age settlement, plus Roman history in general.\nThe museum was established following the excavations carried out by Mortimer Wheeler and his wife, Tessa Wheeler, during the 1930s.\n\nBetween September 1996 and May 1997, the museum was extended. During the building work, an excavation of the site took place. \nIt has won an architectural award for its domed entrance (designed by Peter Melvin).\n\nIt is noted for the large and colourful mosaics and many other artefacts, such as pottery, jewellery, tools and coins, from the Roman period. Many were found in formal excavations, but some, particularly a coffin still containing a male skeleton, were unearthed nearby during building work.\n\nThe asteroid 4206 Verulamium was named in honour of the ancient city.\n\n"}
{"id": "1971075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1971075", "title": "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld", "text": "Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld\n\nWesley Newcomb Hohfeld (9 August 1879, Oakland, California21 October 1918, Alameda, California) was an American jurist. He was the author of the seminal \"Fundamental Legal Conceptions as Applied in Judicial Reasoning and Other Legal Essays\" (1919).\n\nDuring his life he published only a handful of law journal articles. After his death the material forming the basis of \"Fundamental Legal Conceptions\" was derived from two articles in the \"Yale Law Journal\" (1913) and (1917) that had been partially revised with a view to publication. Editorial work was undertaken to complete the revisions and the book was published with the inclusion of the manuscript notes that Hohfeld had left, plus seven other essays.\n\nThe work remains a powerful contribution to modern understanding of the nature of rights and the implications of liberty. To reflect Hohfeld's continuing importance, a chair at Yale University is named after him. The chair is unoccupied as of 2016 but was last held by Jules Coleman, who retired in 2012.\n\nWesley Newcomb Hohfeld was born in California in 1879. He graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1901. He went on to Harvard Law School, where he served as editor of the \"Harvard Law Review\", and graduated in 1904 with honors.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1913 Hohfeld taught at Stanford Law School. He then moved to Yale Law School, where he taught until his death in 1918.\n\nJurisprudence is the branch of philosophy which deals with principles of law and the legal systems through which the law is applied. Hohfeld's contribution was to simplify; he created a very precise analysis which distinguished between fundamental legal concepts and then identified the framework of relationships between them. His work offers a sophisticated method for deconstructing broad legal principles into their component elements. By showing how legal relationships are connected to each other, the resulting analysis illuminates policy implications and identifies the issues which arise in practical decision making.\n\nHohfeld noticed that even respected jurists conflate various meanings of the term \"right\", sometimes switching senses of the word several times in a single sentence. He wrote that such imprecision of language indicated a concomitant imprecision of thought, and thus also of the resulting legal conclusions. In order to both facilitate reasoning and clarify rulings, he attempted to disambiguate the term \"rights\" by breaking it into eight distinct concepts. To eliminate ambiguity, he defined these terms relative to one another, grouping them into four pairs of Jural Opposites and four pairs of Jural Correlatives.\n\nThis use of the words \"right\" and \"privilege\" correspond respectively to the concepts of claim rights and liberty rights.\n\nHohfeld argued that right and duty are correlative concepts, i.e. the one must always be matched by a claim about the other. If A has a right against B, this is equivalent to B having a duty to honor A's right. If B has no duty, that means that B has a privilege, i.e. B can do whatever he or she pleases because B has no duty to refrain from doing it. Each individual is located within a matrix of relationships with other individuals. By summing the rights held and duties owed across all these relationships, the analyst can identify both the degree of liberty — A would have perfect liberty if A has no duty to refrain from acting and others have a duty never to interfere with A's actions — and whether the concept of liberty is comprised by commonly followed practices, thereby establishing general moral principles and civil rights.\n\nHohfeld defines the correlatives in terms of the relationships between two individuals. In the theory of \"in rem rights\", there is a direct relationship between a person and a thing. Real rights are in this respect unlike claim rights or \"rights in personam\", which by nature must be exercised against a person, the best example being when someone is owed money by another. Hohfeld demonstrates that this way of understanding rights in general is wrong. In particular, Hohfeld demonstrates that there is no such thing as a legal relation between a person and a thing, since a legal relation always operates between two people. As the legal relations between any two people are complex, it is helpful to break them down into their simplest forms. Legal rights do not correspond to single Hohfeldian relations, but are compounds of them. A right can be defined as an aggregate of the Hohfeldian relations with other people.\n\nHohfeld replaces the concept of \"right in personam\" by \"paucital right\" and \"right in rem\" by a compound or aggregate of \"multital rights\". Rights held by a person against one or a few definite persons are paucital (or \"in personam\"), and rights held by a person against a large indefinite class of people are multital (or \"in rem\"). A contract right is paucital (or \"in personam\") because it can be enforced only against the specific parties to the contract. A property right is multital (or \"in rem\") because a landowner has the right to exclude not only specific people from his land but the \"whole world\". The landowner has many rights, privileges, powers, and immunities; his multital rights are composed of many paucital rights. For example, the owner has a right that others do not step on his land but there is not just one such right against a mass of persons (the community), but many separate although usually identical paucital rights with this content (as many instances as there are people in the community). This is what Hohfeld calls \"multital\" rights.\n\nConsider also the definition of liberty. In Hohfeldian analysis, liberty is defined by an absence both of a duty and of a right. B is free because he has no duty to refrain from acting and because A has no right that he not act. That does not deny that B might decide to do what A wants because that is the essence of liberty. Nor does it deny the possibility that B might accept a duty to A to give a benefit to C. In that situation, C would have no right and would have to rely on A to enforce the duty. The truth is that liberty is significant from both a legal and a moral point of view because only liberty ensures that an individual has control over his or her choices on whether and how to act. If something interferes with this choice, the natural reaction is to resent it and to seek a remedy. The correlative between right and duty inevitably describes the way in which two people are limited in their choices to act, and the outside observer cannot capture the legal and moral implications without examining the nature of the right held by A. Hence, this relationship is qualitatively different. An interference with liberty would be considered wrongful without having to ask for detailed evidence. Yet whether A's relationship with B is morally suspect could only be determined by evaluating evidence on precisely what B's duty requires B to do or not to do.\n\n\n\n"}

It was loosely based on her own experiences caring for her mother who was dying of cancer. \n\nClemmons was a graduate student in the fiction MFA program at Columbia University, working on a novel, when her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. She finished her degree but set aside the novel, instead writing journals of her experiences caring for and ultimately grieving her mother's death. These became the basis of a more experimental project than her unfinished linear novel, a fragmentary and chronologically disrupted \"exercise in autofiction\".\n\nThandi, the daughter of an South Africa mother and an American father, comes of age in Pennsylvania. When she is in college, her mother is stricken by cancer and dies, causing Thandi's life to fall apart as she struggles to process her grief.\n\nShortly thereafter, Thandi discovers she is pregnant by her boyfriend Peter. She decides to carry the pregnancy to term and has a son she names Mahpee. She and Peter quickly marry and he moves to New York City to be with her and their child. However their marriage quickly falls apart and after she cheats on him, she decides to ask for a separation. \n\nThandi begins to forget her mother and slowly begins to heal, though she realizes her mother's death will haunt her for the rest of her life.\n\nIn \"The Guardian\", Marta Bausells described \"What We Lose\" as \"highly experimental, told in intimate vignettes including blogposts, photos, hand-drawn charts and hip-hop lyrics\". In \"Vogue\", Megan O'Grady notes the book's \"boldly innovative and frankly sexual\" style, noting \"the collage-like novel mixes hand-drawn charts, archival photographs, rap lyrics, sharp disquisitions on the Mandelas and Oscar Pistorius, and singular meditations on racism’s brutal intimacies.\" O'Grady compared Clemmons to authors like Karl Ove Knausgaard, Meghan O’Rourke, and Claudia Rankine. \n\nClemmons cites Toni Morrison's \"The Bluest Eye\" as a significant influence for \"What We Lose\".\n\nThe novel received overwhelmingly positive reviews. \"The New York Times\" review said, \"The book’s distinctive form and voice give it an unusual capacity to show how individuals connect deep feeling to broad political understanding — an experience too rarely rendered in fiction.\" \"The Guardian\" called \"a debut of haunting fragments\". \"The Telegraph\" praised it as an \"Intelligently and impressively conceived, and beautifully told\" novel.\n"}
