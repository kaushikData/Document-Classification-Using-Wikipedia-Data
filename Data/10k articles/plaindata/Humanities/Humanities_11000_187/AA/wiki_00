Arabic countries have many styles of music and also many dialects; each country has its own traditional music.\n\nArabic music has a long history of interaction with many other regional musical styles and genres. It represents the music of all the peoples that make up the Arab world today, all the 22 states. \n\nPre-Islamic Gulf Arab music was similar to that of Ancient Middle Eastern music. Most historians agree that there existed distinct forms of music in the Arabian peninsula in the pre-Islamic period between the 5th and 7th century AD. Arab poets of that time—called \"shu`ara' al-Jahiliyah\" (Arabic: شعراء الجاهلية) or \"Jahili poets\", meaning \"the poets of the period of ignorance\"—used to recite poems with a high notes.\n\nIt was believed that Jinns revealed poems to poets and music to musicians. The choir at the time served as a pedagogic facility where the educated poets would recite their poems. Singing was not thought to be the work of these intellectuals and was instead entrusted to women with beautiful voices who would learn how to play some instruments used at that time such as the drum, the guitar or the rebab, and perform the songs while respecting the poetic metre. The compositions were simple and every singer would sing in a single \"maqam\". Among the notable songs of the period were the \"huda\" (from which the \"ghina\" derived), the \"nasb\", \"sanad\", and \"rukbani\".\n\nBoth compositions and improvisations in traditional Arabic music are based on the \"maqam\" system. \"Maqams\" can be realized with either vocal or instrumental music, and do not include a rhythmic component.\n\nAl-Kindi (801–873 AD) was a notable early theorist of Arabic music. He joined several others like al-Farabi in proposing the addition of a makeshift fifth string to the oud. He published several tracts on musical theory, including the cosmological connotations of music. He identified twelve tones on the Arabic musical scale, based on the location of fingers on and the strings of the oud.\n\nAbulfaraj (897–967) wrote the \"Kitab al-Aghani\", an encyclopedic collection of poems and songs that runs to over 20 volumes in modern editions.\n\nAl-Farabi (872–950) wrote a notable book on music titled \"Kitab al-Musiqi al-Kabir\" (The Great Book of Music). His pure Arabian tone system is still used in Arabic music.\n\nAl-Ghazali (1059–1111) wrote a treatise on music in Persia which declared, \"Ecstasy means the state that comes from listening to music\".\n\nIn 1252, Safi al-Din developed a unique form of musical notation, where rhythms were represented by geometric representation. A similar geometric representation would not appear in the Western world until 1987, when Kjell Gustafson published a method to represent a rhythm as a two-dimensional graph.\n\nBy the 11th century, Islamic Iberia had become a center for the manufacture of instruments. These goods spread gradually throughout France, influencing French troubadours, and eventually reaching the rest of Europe. The English words lute, rebec, and naker are derived from Arabic oud, rabab, and naqareh.\n\nBartol Gyurgieuvits (1506–1566) spent 13 years as a slave in the Ottoman empire. After escaping, he published \"De Turvarum ritu et caermoniis\" in Amsterdam in 1544. It is one of the first European books to describe music in Islamic society. The origins of the \"belly dance\" are very obscure, as depictions and descriptions are rare. It may have originated in pre-Islamic Arabia. Examples have been found from 200 BCE, suggesting a possible pre-Islamic origin.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Egypt was the first in a series of Arab countries to experience a sudden emergence of nationalism, as it became independent after 2000 years of foreign rule. Any English, French or Turkish songs got replaced by national Egyptian music. Cairo became a center for musical innovation.\n\nFemale singers were some of the first to take a secular approach. Egyptian performer Umm Kulthum and Lebanese singer Fairuz were notable examples of this. Both have been popular through the decades that followed and both are considered legends of Arabic music. Across the Mediterranean, Moroccan singer Zohra Al Fassiya was the first female performer to achieve wide popularity in the Maghreb region, performing traditional Arab Andalusian folk songs and later recording numerous albums of her own.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Arabic music began to take on a more Western tone – Egyptian artists Umm Kulthum and Abdel Halim Hafez along with composers Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Baligh Hamdi pioneered the use of western instruments in Egyptian music. By the 1970s several other singers had followed suit and a strand of Arabic pop was born. Arabic pop usually consists of Western styled songs with Arabic instruments and lyrics. Melodies are often a mix between Eastern and Western. Beginning in the mid-1980s, Lydia Canaan, musical pioneer widely regarded as the first rock star of the Middle East fused English lyrics and Western sound with Middle-Eastern quarter tones and microtones and became the first internationally successful Lebanese recording artist.\n\nWestern pop music was also being influenced by Arabic music in the early 1960s, leading to the development of surf music, a rock music genre that later gave rise to garage rock and punk rock. Surf rock pioneer Dick Dale, a Lebanese American guitarist, was greatly influenced by the Arabic music he learnt from his uncle, particularly the oud and derbakki (doumbek) drum, skills which he later applied to his electric guitar playing when recording surf rock in the early 1960s.\n\nIn the 1990s, several artists have taken up such a style including Amr Diab, Najwa Karam, Elissa, Nawal Al Zoghbi, Nancy Ajram, Haifa Wehbe, Angham, Fadl Shaker, Majida Al Roumi, Wael Kfoury, Asalah Nasri, Myriam Fares, Carole Samaha, Yara, Samira Said, Hisham Abbas, Kadhem Al Saher, Mostafa Amar, Ehab Tawfik, Mohamed Fouad, Diana Haddad, Mohamed Mounir, Latifa, Cheb Khaled, George Wassouf, Hakim, Fares Karam, Julia Boutros, and Amal Hijazi.\n\nThe names of a number of musical instruments used in classical music are believed to be derived from Arabic terms, though many of the instruments themselves were already used in Europe. Words with Arabic origins include: lute, derived from \"oud\"; rebec (an ancestor of the violin) from \"rebab\", guitar from \"qitara\", naker from \"naqareh\", adufe from \"al-duff\", alboka from \"al-buq\", anafil from \"al-nafir\", exabeba (a type of flute) from \"al-shabbaba\", atabal (a type of bass drum) from \"al-tabl\", atambal from \"al-tinbal\",\nthe balaban, castanet from \"kasatan\", and sonajas de azófar from \"sunuj al-sufr\". Some of these words were used only in Spain and southern France.\n\nA number of medieval conical bore instruments were likely introduced or popularized by Arab musicians, including the xelami (from \"zulami\"). \n\nSome scholars believe that the troubadors may have had Arabian origins, with Magda Bogin stating that the Arab poetic and musical tradition was one of several influences on European \"courtly love poetry\". Évariste Lévi-Provençal and other scholars stated that three lines of a poem by William IX of Aquitaine were in some form of Arabic, indicating a potential Andalusian origin for his works. The scholars attempted to translate the lines in question and produced various different translations. The medievalist Istvan Frank contended that the lines were not Arabic at all, but instead the result of the rewriting of the original by a later scribe.\n\nThe theory that the troubadour tradition was created by William after his experience of Moorish arts while fighting with the Reconquista in Spain has been championed by Ramón Menéndez Pidal and Idries Shah. George T. Beech states that there is only one documented battle that William fought in Spain, and it occurred towards the end of his life. Beech adds that William and his father did have Spanish individuals within their extended family, and that while there is no evidence he himself knew Arabic, he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak the language. Others state that the notion that William created the concept of troubadours is itself incorrect, and that his \"songs represent not the beginnings of a tradition but summits of achievement in that tradition.\" \n\nMost scholars believe that Guido of Arezzo's Solfège musical notation system had its origins in a Latin hymn, but others suggest that it may have had Arabic origins instead. It has been argued that the Solfège syllables (\"do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti\") may have been derived from the syllables of an Arabic solmization system \"Durr-i-Mufassal\" (\"Separated Pearls\") (\"dal, ra, mim, fa, sad, lam\"). This was first proposed by Meninski in his \"Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalum\" (1680). However, there is no documentary evidence for this theory, and no Arabic musical manuscripts utilizing sequences from the Arabic alphabet are known to exist. Henry George Farmer believes that there is no firm evidence on the origins of the notation, and therefore the Arabian origin theory and the hymnal origin theories are equally credible.\n\nFranco-Arabic music is a popular form of West-meets-East style of music, similar in many respects to modern Arabic Pop. This blend of western and eastern music was popularized by artists such as Dalida (Egypt), Sammy Clark (Lebanon), and Aldo from Australia. Although Franco-Arabic music includes many forms of cross-cultural blending between the West and the Middle East, musically the genre crosses over many lines as is seen in songs that incorporate Arabic and Italian, Arabic and French and, of course, Arabic and English styles or lyrics.\n\nThere has also been a rise of R&B, reggae and hip hop influenced Arab music in the past couple of years. These songs usually feature a rapper in a traditional Arab pop song (such as Ishtar's song 'Habibi Sawah'). The Moroccan singer Elam Jay developed a contemporary version of the Gnawa genre that is fused with R&B which he named \"Gnawitone Styla\". Another variation of contemporary Gnawa played in Morocco is introduced by Darga. Based in Casablanca, the group fuses Gnawa with Reggae. Political Reggae artists such as TootArd from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights from Haifa (Originally from Iqrith) started gaining popularity in Palestine in 2011 after the YouTube premiere of a song about the Arab Spring (mainly the Tunisian revolution), called \"The Green Revolution\", sung by them and an ensemble of Palestinian artists, most notable among them being Mahmoud Jrere of DAM. Notable is Shadia Mansour, a Palestinian British rapper known as \"The First Lady of Arab Hip Hop.\" Much of her music focuses on the Palestinian cause.\n\nAlso there is the Moroccan pop introduced by the Moroccan singer Oussama Belhcen who's mixing between the American and the Moroccan music in his songs.\n\nHowever certain artists have taken to using full R&B and reggae beats and styling such as Darine. This has been met with mixed critical and commercial reaction. As of now it is not a widespread genre.\n\nElectronic dance music is another genre to come out into popularity. Often, songs in this genre would combine electronic musical instruments with traditional Middle Eastern instruments. Artists like Richii popularized this style with songs like \"Ana Lubnaneyoun\".\n\nAnother popular form of West meets East, Arabic jazz is also popular, with many songs using jazz instruments. Early jazz influences began with the use of the saxophone by musicians like Samir Suroor, in the \"oriental\" style. The use of the saxophone in that manner can be found in Abdel Halim Hafez's songs, as well as Kadim Al Sahir and Rida Al Abdallah today. The first mainstream jazz elements were incorporated into Arabic music by the Rahbani brothers. Fairuz's later work was almost exclusively made up of jazz songs, composed by her son Ziad Rahbani. Ziad Rahbani also pioneered today's oriental jazz movement, to which singers including Rima Khcheich, Salma El Mosfi, and (on occasion) Latifa adhere. We can also find a lot of jazz music in Mohamed Mounir's songs starting from his first album Alemony Eneeki in 1977, and he is considered to be the King of Arabic Jazz and Arabic Music generally. Another notable performer of this genre is the Palestinian singer Reem Kelani who blends jazz with Arabic music, both in her own compositions and in her arrangements of traditional songs.\n\nArabic Jazz has met many new kinds of composition since the end of the 20th century:\n\nRock music is popular all around the world, the Arab world being no exception. There have been many Arab rock bands along the years that fused rock, metal and alternative rock sounds with traditional Arab instruments.\n\nArabic rock has been gaining a lot of attention lately in the Middle East with bands like Cairokee, JadaL, Autostrad, El Morabba3 and Akher Zapheer of Jordan, The Wanton Bishops, Mashrou' Leila and Meen of Lebanon, Massar Egbari, Sahara, Wyvern and Cartoon Killerz of Egypt, Khalas, and Chaos of Palestine and Acrassicauda of Iraq. The band Hoba Hoba Spirit from Morocco is also gaining popularity, especially in the Maghrebi region. Rachid Taha, an Algerian musician, plays a fusion of rock and raï.\n\nThe world of modern Arabic music has long been dominated by musical trends that have emerged from Cairo, Egypt. The city is generally considered a cultural center in the Arab world. Innovations in popular music via the influence of other regional styles have also abounded from Morocco to Saudi Arabia. In recent years, Beirut has become an important city where singers can fluently sing in various Arabic Dialects. Other regional styles that have enjoyed popular music status throughout the Arab world, including:\n\n\n\nArabic religious music includes Jewish (Pizmonim and Baqashot), Christian, and Islamic music. However, Islamic music, including the \"Tajwid\" or recitation of Qur'an readings, is structurally equivalent to Arabic secular music, while Christian Arab music has been influenced by Syriac Orthodox, Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Anglican, Coptic, and Maronite church music.\n\nSecular art musical genres include maqam al-iraqi, andalusi nubah, muwashshah, Fjiri songs, qasidah, layali, mawwal, taqsim, bashraf, sama'i, tahmilah, dulab, sawt, and liwa.\n\nMuch of Arabic music is characterized by an emphasis on melody and rhythm, as opposed to harmony. There are some genres of Arabic music that are polyphonic, but typically, Arabic music is homophonic.\n\nHabib Hassan Touma submits that there are five components that characterize Arabic music:\n\nThe basis of Arabic music is the maqam (pl. maqamat), which looks like the mode, but is not quite the same. The tonic note, dominant note, and ending note (unless modulation occurs) are generally determined by the maqam used. Arabic maqam theory as ascribed in literature over the ages names between 90 and 110 maqams, that are grouped into larger categories known as fasilah. Fasilah are groupings of maqams whose first four primary pitches are shared in common.\n\nThe maqam consists of at least two \"ajnas\", or scale segments. \"Ajnas\" is the plural form of \"jins\", which in Arabic comes from the Latin word \"genus\", meaning \"type\". In practice, a jins is either a trichord (three notes), a tetrachord (four notes), or a pentachord (five notes). A maqam usually covers only one octave (usually two ajnas), but can cover more. Like the melodic minor scale, some maqamat use different ajnas when descending and ascending. Due to continuous innovation and the emergence of new ajnas, and because most music scholars have not reached consensus on the subject, a solid figure for the total number of ajnas in use is uncertain. In practice, however, most musicians would agree there are at least eight major ajnas: \"rast\", \"bayat\", \"sikah\", \"hijaz\", \"saba\", \"kurd\", \"nahawand\", and \"ajam\", and commonly used variants such as \"nakriz\", \"athar kurd\", \"sikah beladi\", \"saba zamzama\". \"Mukhalif\" is a rare jins used almost exclusively in Iraq, and it is not used in combination with other ajnas.\n\nUnlike the tradition of Western music, Arabic music contains microtones, which are notes that lie between notes in the Western chromatic scale. While notes in the chromatic scale are separated by semitones (or half steps), notes in Arabic music can be separated by quarter tones. In some treatments of theory, the quarter tone scale or all twenty four tones should exist, but according to Yūsuf Shawqī (1969), fewer tones are used in practice.\n\nAdditionally, in 1932, at the Cairo Congress of Arab Music held in Cairo, Egypt—and attended by such Western luminaries as Béla Bartók and Henry George Farmer—experiments were done that determined conclusively that the notes in actual use differ substantially from an even-tempered 24-tone scale. Furthermore, the intonation of many of those notes differ slightly from region to region (Egypt, Turkey, Syria, Iraq).\n\nAs a result of these findings, the following recommendation was issued: \"The tempered scale and the natural scale should be rejected. In Egypt, the Egyptian scale is to be kept with the values, which were measured with all possible precision. The Turkish, Syrian, and Iraqi scales should remain what they are...\" Both in modern practice, and evident in recorded music over the course of the last century, several differently-tuned Es in between the E-flat and E-natural of the Western Chromatic scale are used, that vary according to the types of maqams and ajnas used, and the region in which they are used.\n\nMusicians and teachers refer to these in-between notes as quarter tones, using \"half-flat\" or \"half-sharp\" as a designation for the in-between flats and sharps, for ease of nomenclature. Performance and teaching of the exact values of intonation in each jins or maqam is usually done by ear. It should also be added, in reference to Habib Hassan Touma's comment above, that these quarter tones are not used everywhere in the maqamat: in practice, Arabic music does not modulate to 12 different tonic areas like the Well-Tempered Klavier. The most commonly used quarter tones are on E (between E and E), A, B, D, F (between F and F), and C.\n\nArab classical music is known for its famed virtuoso singers, who sing long, elaborately ornamented, melismatic tunes, and are known for driving audiences into ecstasy. Its traditions come from pre-Islamic times, when female singing slaves entertained the wealthy, inspired warriors on the battlefield with their rajaz poetry, and performed at weddings.\n\nThe prototypical Arabic music ensemble in Egypt and Syria is known as the takht, and includes, (or included at different time periods) instruments such as the 'oud, qānūn, rabab, ney, violin (introduced in the 1840s or 50s), riq and dumbek. In Iraq, the traditional ensemble, known as the chalghi, includes only two melodic instruments—the jowza (similar to the rabab but with four strings) and santur—accompanied by the riq and dumbek. The Arab world has incorporated instruments from the West, including the electric guitar, cello, double bass and oboe, and incorporated influences from jazz and other foreign musical styles.\n\nThe singers have remained the stars, however, especially after the development of the recording and film industry in the 1920s in Cairo. These singing celebrities are (or were) the biggest stars in Arabic classic music, they include Farid Al Attrache, Asmahan, Abdel Halim Hafez, Sayed Darwish, Mohamed Abdel Wahab, Warda Al-Jazairia, Wadih El Safi, Fairuz, Sabah, and Umm Kulthum\n\nhttp://www.bibliotecavirtualdeandalucia.es/catalogo/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=1002977\nhttp://hdl.handle.net/10481/21906\n"}

Ferreira and colleagues built the paradigm in order to address the scarcity of (fluent) spoken-language comprehension literature versus the robustness of that for visual-word processing. Auditory moving-window can be used to assess indirectly the processing load of a sentence: this processing load is assessed by an analogue of reaction time within the paradigm (discussed below). Reaction times within the paradigm are sensitive to at least word frequency and garden path effects.\n\nThe paradigm has been used in the study of syntactic processing in the study of aphasic patients. One such study suggests that many aphasic patients retain their abilities to process syntactic structures on-line. Further, evidence suggests that Expressive aphasics have a degraded ability to process complex syntax on-line, whereas Receptive aphasics are impaired only after on-line comprehension concludes \n\nThe auditory moving-window paradigm, because of its similarity to the eye tracking paradigm, has a broad range of applications. It is at least sensitive enough to detect frequency effects on comprehension: low frequency words had a greater IRT and DT than high frequency words, suggesting a relative difficulty of lexical access. Further, it is sensitive to garden path effects\n\nBecause one of the aims of the auditory moving-window is to investigate fluent speech, the paradigm is several steps more complex than simple auditory word-by-word presentation:\n\nThe presentation of a prepared sample depends on what software is being used. What follows is an abstraction of the general strategy.\n\nThe auditory moving-window is roughly analogous to an eye tracking task presented in the auditory modality. The eye tracking variable of interest that is thought to be closest to the DT is that of fixation duration. They are held to be directly related: a greater DT is correspondent to a greater fixation duration. Several eye-tracking studies use fixation duration as an indirect measure of processing load: a greater fixation duration is correspondent to a greater processing load . The same applies to DTs.\n"}

Bronllys is also the name of an electoral ward to Powys County Council.\n\nThe village is in the historic county of Brecknockshire (Breconshire). It has recently benefited from a new bypass as part of the Talgarth Relief Road and Bronllys Bypass scheme. \n\nDespite being a small village it has a swimming pool and small leisure centre, post office and hospital.\n\nBronllys castle is a motte and bailey fortress standing south of the village, towards Talgarth. The castle was founded in or soon after 1144 when the district was granted to Walter de Clifford (died 1190) by Roger Fitzmiles, 2nd Earl of Hereford. Walter seems to have been responsible for building the round tower on the motte for in 1165 it caught fire and a stone tumbling from the battlements killed Earl Roger's last surviving brother Mahel de Hereford. In September 1233 Walter's grandson, Walter de Clifford (died 1263), had a force of over 200 men here defending the castle against his father-in-law Llywelyn ab Iorwerth. The castle passed from the Cliffords to the Giffards and eventually the de Bohun Earls of Hereford.\nIn 1399 Henry IV took possession of all de Bohun property. The castle was additionally fortified against Owain Glyndŵr during the early years of his rebellion in the early 15th century. Bronllys Castle was never again occupied and by 1583 had fallen into disrepair. A short spell in the possession of the Duke of Buckingham did nothing to improve its state, and in 1521 was once again crown property, where it has remained ever since.

{"id": "2154635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2154635", "title": "Carolingian art", "text": "Carolingian art\n\nCarolingian art comes from the Frankish Empire in the period of roughly 120 years from about 780 to 900—during the reign of Charlemagne and his immediate heirs—popularly known as the Carolingian Renaissance. The art was produced by and for the court circle and a group of important monasteries under Imperial patronage; survivals from outside this charmed circle show a considerable drop in quality of workmanship and sophistication of design. The art was produced in several centres in what are now France, Germany, Austria, northern Italy and the Low Countries, and received considerable influence, via continental mission centres, from the Insular art of the British Isles, as well as a number of Byzantine artists who appear to have been resident in Carolingian centres.\n\nThere was for the first time a thoroughgoing attempt in Northern Europe to revive and emulate classical Mediterranean art forms and styles, that resulted in a blending of classical and Northern elements in a sumptuous and dignified style, in particular introducing to the North confidence in representing the human figure, and setting the stage for the rise of Romanesque art and eventually Gothic art in the West. The Carolingian era is part of the period in medieval art sometimes called the \"Pre-Romanesque\". After a rather chaotic interval following the Carolingian period, the new Ottonian dynasty revived Imperial art from about 950, building on and further developing Carolingian style in Ottonian art.\n\nHaving established an Empire as large as the Byzantine Empire of the day, and rivaling in size the old Western Roman Empire, the Carolingian court must have been conscious that they lacked an artistic style to match these or even the post-antique (or \"sub-antique\" as Ernst Kitzinger called it) art still being produced in small quantities in Rome and a few other centres in Italy, which Charlemagne knew from his campaigns, and where he was crowned Holy Roman Emperor in Rome in 800.\n\nAs symbolic representative of Rome he sought the \"renovatio\" (revival) of Roman culture and learning in the West, and needed an art capable of telling stories and representing figures with an effectiveness which ornamental Germanic Migration period art could not. He wished to establish himself as the heir to the great rulers of the past, to emulate and symbolically link the artistic achievements of Early Christian and Byzantine culture with his own.\n\nBut it was more than a conscious desire to revive ancient Roman culture. During Charlemagne's reign the Byzantine Iconoclasm controversy was dividing the Byzantine Empire. Charlemagne supported the Western church's consistent refusal to follow iconoclasm; the Libri Carolini sets out the position of his court circle, no doubt under his direction. With no inhibitions from a cultural memory of Mediterranean pagan idolatry, Charlemagne introduced the first Christian monumental religious sculpture, a momentous precedent for Western art.\n\nReasonable numbers of Carolingian illuminated manuscripts and small-scale sculptures, mostly in ivory, have survived, but far fewer examples of metalwork, mosaics and frescoes and other types of work. Many manuscripts in particular are copies or reinterpretations of Late Antique or Byzantine models, nearly all now lost, and the nature of the influence of specific models on individual Carolingian works remains a perennial topic in art history. As well as these influences, the extravagant energy of Insular art added a definite flavour to Carolingian work, which sometimes used interlacedecoration, and followed more cautiously the insular freedom in allowing decoration to spread around and into the text on the page of a manuscript.\n\nWith the end of Carolingian rule around 900, high quality artistic production greatly declined for about three generations in the Empire. By the later 10th century with the Cluny reform movement, and a revived spirit for the idea of Empire, art production began again. New Pre-Romanesque styles appeared in Germany with the Ottonian art of the next stable dynasty, in England with late Anglo-Saxon art, after the threat from the Vikings was removed, and in Spain.\n\nThe most numerous surviving works of the Carolingian renaissance are illuminated manuscripts. A number of luxury manuscripts, mostly Gospel books, have survived, decorated with a relatively small number of full-page miniatures, often including evangelist portraits, and lavish canon tables, following the precedent of the Insular art of Britain and Ireland. Narrative images and especially cycles are rarer, but many exist, mostly of the Old Testament, especially Genesis; New Testament scenes are more often found on the ivory reliefs on the covers. The oversized and heavily decorated initials of Insular art were adopted, and the historiated initial further developed, with small narrative scenes seen for the first time towards the end of the period—notably in the Drogo Sacramentary. Luxury manuscripts were given treasure bindings or rich covers with jewels set in gold and carved ivory panels, and, as in Insular art, were prestige objects kept in the church or treasury, and a different class of object from the working manuscripts kept in the library, where some initials might be decorated, and pen drawings added in a few places. A few of the grandest imperial manuscripts were written on purple parchment. The Bern Physiologus is a relatively rare example of a secular manuscript heavily illustrated with fully painted miniatures, lying in between these two classes, and perhaps produced for the private library of an important individual, as was the Vatican Terence. The Utrecht Psalter, stands alone as a very heavily illustrated library version of the Psalms done in pen and wash, and almost certainly copied from a much earlier manuscript.\n\nOther liturgical works were sometimes produced in luxury manuscripts, such as sacramentaries, but no Carolingian Bible is decorated as heavily as the Late Antique examples that survive in fragments. Teaching books such as theological, historical, literary and scientific works from ancient authors were copied and generally only illustrated in ink, if at all. The Chronography of 354 was a Late Roman manuscript that apparently was copied in the Carolingian period, though this copy seems to have been lost in the 17th century.\n\nCarolingian manuscripts are presumed to have been produced largely or entirely by clerics, in a few workshops around the Carolingian Empire, each with its own style that developed based on the artists and influences of that particular location and time. Manuscripts often have inscriptions, not necessarily contemporary, as to who commissioned them, and which church or monastery they were given to, but few dates or names and locations of those producing them. The surviving manuscripts have been assigned, and often reassigned, to workshops by scholars, and the controversies attending this process have largely died down. The earliest workshop was the Court School of Charlemagne; then a Rheimsian style, which became the most influential of the Carolingian period; a Touronian style; a Drogo style; and finally a Court School of Charles the Bald. These are the major centres, but others exist, characterized by the works of art produced there.\n\nThe Court School of Charlemagne (also known as the Ada School) produced the earliest manuscripts, including the Godescalc Evangelistary (781–783); the Lorsch Gospels (778–820); the Ada Gospels; the Soissons Gospels; the Harley Golden Gospels (800-820); and the Vienna Coronation Gospels; ten manuscripts in total are usually recognised. The Court School manuscripts were ornate and ostentatious, and reminiscent of 6th-century ivories and mosaics from Ravenna, Italy. They were the earliest Carolingian manuscripts and initiated a revival of Roman classicism, yet still maintained Migration Period art (Merovingian and Insular) traditions in their basically linear presentation, with no concern for volume and spatial relationships.\n\nIn the early 9th-century Archbishop Ebo of Rheims, at Hautvillers (near Rheims), assembled artists and transformed Carolingian art to something entirely new. The Gospel book of Ebbo (816–835) was painted with swift, fresh and vibrant brush strokes, evoking an inspiration and energy unknown in classical Mediterranean forms. Other books associated with the Rheims school include the Utrecht Psalter, which was perhaps the most important of all Carolingian manuscripts, and the \"Bern Physiologus\", the earliest Latin edition of the Christian allegorical text on animals. The expressive animations of the Rheims school, in particular the Utrecht Psalter with its naturalistic expressive figurine line drawings, would have influence on northern medieval art for centuries to follow, into the Romanesque period.\n\nAnother style developed at the monastery of St Martin of Tours, in which large Bibles were illustrated based on Late Antique bible illustrations. Three large Touronian Bibles were created, the last, and best, example was made about 845/846 for Charles the Bald, called the Vivian Bible. The Tours School was cut short by the invasion of the Normans in 853, but its style had already left a permanent mark on other centers in the Carolingian Empire.\n\nThe diocese of Metz was another center of Carolingian art. Between 850 and 855 a sacramentary was made for Bishop Drogo called the Drogo Sacramentary. The illuminated \"historiated\" decorated initials (see image this page) were to have influence into the Romanesque period and were a harmonious union of classical lettering with figural scenes.\n\nIn the second half of the 9th century the traditions of the first half continued. A number of richly decorated Bibles were made for Charles the Bald, fusing Late Antiquity forms with the styles developed at Rheims and Tours. It was during this time a Franco-Saxon style appeared in the north of France, integrating Hiberno-Saxon interlace, and would outlast all other Carolingian styles into the next century.\n\nCharles the Bald, like his grandfather, also established a Court School. Its location is uncertain but several manuscripts are attributed to it, with the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram (870) being the last and most spectacular. It contained Touronian and Rheimsian elements, but fused with the style that characterized Charlemagne's Court School more formal manuscripts.\n\nWith the death of Charles the Bald patronage for manuscripts declined, signaling the beginning of the end, but some work did continue for a while. The Abbey of St. Gall created the Folchard Psalter (872) and the Golden Psalter (883). This Gallish style was unique, but lacked the level of technical mastery seen in other regions.\n\nLuxury Carolingian manuscripts were intended to have treasure bindings—ornate covers in precious metal set with jewels around central carved ivory panels—sometimes these were donated some time after the manuscript itself was produced. Only a few such covers have survived intact, but many of the ivory panels survive detached, where the covers have been broken up for their materials. The subjects were often narrative religious scenes in vertical sections, largely derived from Late Antique paintings and carvings, as were those with more hieratic images derived from consular diptychs and other imperial art, such as the front and back covers of the Lorsch Gospels, which adapt a 6th-century Imperial triumph to the triumph of Christ and the Virgin.\n\nImportant Carolingian examples of goldsmith's work include the upper cover of the Lindau Gospels; the cover of the Codex Aureus of St. Emmeram, which can be precisely dated to 870, is probably a product of the same workshop, though there are differences of style. This workshop is associated with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles II (the Bald), and often called his \"Palace School\". Its location (if it had a fixed one) remains uncertain and much discussed, but Saint-Denis Abbey outside Paris is one leading possibility. The Arnulf Ciborium (a miniature architectural ciborium rather than the vessel for hosts), now in the Munich Residenz, is the third major work in the group; all three have fine relief figures in repoussé gold. Another work associated with the workshop is the frame of an antique serpentine dish in the Louvre. Recent scholars tend to group the Lindau Gospels and the Arnulf Ciborium in closer relation to each other than the Codex Aureus to either.\n\nCharlemagne revived large-scale bronze casting when he created a foundry at Aachen which cast the doors for his palace chapel, in imitation of Roman designs. The chapel also had a now lost life-size crucifix, with the figure of Christ in gold, the first known work of this type, which was to become so important a feature of medieval church art. Probably a wooden figure was mechanically gilded, as with the Ottonian Golden Madonna of Essen.\n\nOne of the finest examples of Carolingian goldsmiths' work is the Golden Altar (824–859), a \"paliotto\", in the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan. The altars four sides are decorated with images in gold and silver repoussé, framed by borders of filigree, precious stones and enamel.\n\nThe Lothair Crystal, of the middle of the 9th century, is one of the largest of a group of about 20 engraved pieces of rock crystal which survive; this shows large numbers of figures in several scenes showing the unusual subject of the story of Suzanna.\n\nSources attest to the abundance of wall paintings seen in churches and palaces, most of which have not survived. Records of inscriptions show that their subject matter was primarily religious.\n\nMosaics installed in Charlemagne's palatine chapel showed an enthroned Christ worshipped by the Evangelist's symbols and the twenty-four elders from the Apocalypse. This mosaic no longer survives, but an over-restored one remains in the apse of the oratory at Germigny-des-Prés (806) which shows the Ark of the Covenant adored by angels, discovered in 1820 under a coat of plaster.\n\nThe villa to which the oratory was attached belonged to a key associate of Charlemagne, Bishop Theodulf of Orléans. It was destroyed later in the century, but had frescos of the Seven liberal arts, the Four Seasons, and the Mappa Mundi. We know from written sources of other frescos in churches and palaces, nearly all completely lost. Charlemagne's Aachen palace contained a wall painting of the Liberal Arts, as well as narrative scenes from his war in Spain. The palace of Louis the Pious at Ingelheim contained historical images from antiquity to the time of Charlemagne, and the palace church contained typological scenes of the Old and New Testaments juxtaposed with one another.\n\nFragmentary paintings have survived at Auxerre, Coblenz, Lorsch, Cologne, Fulda, Corvey, Trier, Müstair, Mals, Naturns, Cividale, Brescia and Milan.\n\n\"Spolia\" is the Latin term for \"spoils\" and is used to refer to the taking or appropriation of ancient monumental or other art works for new uses or locations. We know that many marbles and columns were brought from Rome northward during this period.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of Carolingian spolia is the tale of an equestrian statue. In Rome, Charlemagne had seen the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in the Lateran Palace. It was the only surviving statue of a pre-Christian Roman Emperor because it was mistakenly thought, at the time, to be that of Constantine and thus held great accord—Charlemagne thus brought an equestrian statue from Ravenna, then believed to be that of Theodoric the Great, to Aachen, to match the statue of \"Constantine\" in Rome.\n\nAntique carved gems were reused in various settings, without much regard to their original iconography.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5199397", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5199397", "title": "Charles Eamer Kempe", "text": "Charles Eamer Kempe\n\nCharles Eamer Kempe (29 June 1837 – 29 April 1907) was a Victorian designer and manufacturer of stained glass. His studios produced over 4,000 windows and also designs for altars and altar frontals, furniture and furnishings, lichgates and memorials that helped to define a later nineteenth-century Anglican style. The list of English cathedrals containing examples of his work includes: Chester, Gloucester, Hereford, Lichfield, Wells, Winchester and York.\n\nCharles Kempe was born at Ovingdean Hall, near Brighton, East Sussex in 1837. He was the youngest son of Nathaniel Kemp, a cousin of Thomas Read Kemp, a politician and property developer responsible for the Kemptown area of Brighton and the maternal grandson of Sir John Eamer, who served as Lord Mayor of London in 1801.\n\nAfter attending Twyford School, he attended Pembroke College, Oxford where he was influenced by the Anglo-Catholic Tractarian revival and considered a vocation to the priesthood. When it became clear that his severe stammer would be an impediment to preaching Kempe decided that \"if I was not permitted to minister in the Sanctuary I would use my talents to adorn it\", and subsequently went to study architecture with the firm of a leading ecclesiastical architect George Frederick Bodley, where he learned the aesthetic principles of medieval church art, particularly stained glass. During the 1860s Kempe collaborated with Bodley on the internal painting of two churches, All Saints, Jesus Lane in Cambridge and St John’s, Tuebrook in Liverpool. Later, in 1892, Bodley and Kempe would work together once more on All Saints at Danehill, East Sussex.\n\nIn 1866 he opened a studio of his own in London, supplying and creating stained glass and furnishings and vestments. The firm prospered and by 1899 he had over fifty employees. As a trademark, the firm used a golden \"garb\" or wheatsheaf, taken from Kempe's own coat of arms. The mid-Victorian period were important years in the history of the design of English churches and Kempe’s influence is found in numerous examples, many in his home county of Sussex which has 116 examples of his work. The works at St Mark’s, Staplefield near Horsham, West Sussex dating from 1869 are regarded as especially important, representing the earliest of three known examples of Kempe’s wall painting. They contain key elements of Kempe’s figurative work. The angels holding the scroll are magnificently apparelled and the borders of their cloaks are embellished with pearls, each individually highlighted although they do not contain a design of peacock feathers, a well used embellishment in later works. Rosalie Glynn Grylls, Lady Mander, whose home Wightwick Manor, near Wolverhampton, contains many pieces of Kempe's stained glass, wrote in 1973:\n\"Kempe's work has a unique charm; its colours shine out from jewels that cluster on the mitres or the crowns his figures wear and from their peacocks' feathers, while angels playing their instruments are drawn with tender delicacy and scattered above the main windows informally but making a pattern of precision. Above all, the prevailing yellow wash is literally translucent, for it lets through the rays of the full or the setting sun...\" \n\nOn Kempe’s death in 1907 in accordance with his will the firm was reformed as C. E Kempe & Co. Ltd and Kempe's distant cousin, Walter Earnest Tower (1873–1955), was appointed Chairman. Tower thenceforth used a black tower above the golden garb. A lack of orders caused by the Great Depression ended the firm's life in 1934.\n\nKempe was a rather shy person, who never married. He continued to live in Sussex most of his life and in 1875 he bought and renovated an Elizabethan House at Lindfield, near Haywards Heath in West Sussex. Kempe would entertain his clients and professional colleagues from his home enjoying the role of a country squire.\n\nKempe died suddenly on 28 April 1907 aged 69, at 28 Nottingham Place, London, having caught a cold that led to congestion of the lung and refused to get medical help. He \nis buried in the churchyard at St Wulfran's Church, Ovingdean. Unfortunately, most of Kempe's records were disposed of after the firm shut in 1934.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41999191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41999191", "title": "Chief Culture Officer", "text": "Chief Culture Officer\n\nChief Culture Officer (2009) is the eighth book by Canadian author and anthropologist Grant McCracken. The book looks at how modern business attempt to connect with culture. In the author's analysis he considers examples such as Dove's campaign for real beauty, and the I Love New York advertising campaign.\n\nAccording to McCracken, the book is about highlighting the importance of modern culture for businesses, and in doing so, to create a position within them for a \"person who knows culture, both its fads and fashions, and its deep, enduring structures\": a Chief Culture Officer.\n\nIn the book, McCracken recounts how corporations that successfully adapt to the cultural changes tend to prosper. His definition of culture begins with a distinction between fast and slow:\n\n\"Fast culture is like all the boats on the surface of the Pacific. We can spot them, track them. Slow culture is everything beneath the surface: less well charted, much less visible\"\n\nMcCracken argues that when fast and slow culture meet, a convergent culture is created. He points to the preppy subculture as an example of a convergent culture that brands such as Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger have capitalized on. He also analyses the convergence of status, shifting from a class based value system to celebrity, and the cool convergence, an aesthetic that he states developed alongside the baby boomer generation.\n\nChanging relationships, McCracken argues, between consumers and producers have created new opportunities for brands to connect with culture. He observes that whilst only 1 in 100 people create content on the Internet, the creator consumer dynamic used to be \"1 in 10,000\". McCracken believes this change allows consumers to become an \"active participant in the branding process\". He refers to Converse's 2005 motto as an illustration of this change: \n\"We don't own the brand. Consumers do\"\nFor business's attempting to closely monitor culture, McCracken advises against employing \"cool hunters\" who \"know only what suits them.\" Instead, he recommends creating a position for a Chief Culture Officer who is aware of both fast and slow culture, a \"creature of many worlds, captives of none.\"\n\nHarvard Business Review recommended the book in their 2010 magazine, stating \"a CCO is necessary for any competitive, consumer-oriented company\". The Bookforum, however, declared the book \"no different from the management tomes that have preceded it\".\nSince publication a number of corporations have created the position of Chief Culture Officer (CCO). Stacy Sullivan, the CCO for Google, was appointed by Sergey Brin and Larry Page to \"enhance and develop\" the corporations culture Author and Advertising industry subject expert Lorraine Stewart has also advised Advertising agencies to appoint a CCO, to \"create sustained competitive advantage and increase their own agency-brand value\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "752054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=752054", "title": "Clinton v. City of New York", "text": "Clinton v. City of New York\n\nClinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417 (1998), is a legal case in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the line-item veto as granted in the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution because it impermissibly gave the President of the United States the power to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of statutes that had been duly passed by the United States Congress. The decision of the Court, in a six-to-three majority, was delivered by Justice John Paul Stevens.\n\nThe Line Item Veto Act of 1996 allowed the president to \"cancel\", that is to void or legally nullify, certain provisions of appropriations bills, and disallowed the use of funds from canceled provisions for offsetting deficit spending in other areas.\n\nThe 1994 federal midterm elections signaled a sea-change in American politics known as the Republican Revolution, with the Republican Party taking control of both houses of the U.S. Congress from Democrats. Key to that revolution was the Republicans' Contract with America, which included a list of actions they promised to take if they gained control of Congress. Among this list was the Line Item Veto Act itself, one of two provisions designed to ensure congressional fiscal conservatism. The Act was the only provision of the \"Contract with America\" that President Clinton supported.\n\nAt its passage, the Act was politically controversial, with many Democrats breaking with Clinton to oppose it. Of the opposition, six members of Congress, including Republican Mark Hatfield, sued to prevent use of the line-item veto. They were granted summary judgment by the U.S. District Court, but the Supreme Court held that the Congressmen lacked standing because they could not show any particularized harm, and dismissed their suit in \"Raines v. Byrd\", 521 U.S. 811 (1997). Within the next two months, Clinton began using the line-item veto, prompting several entities to file suit in a second attempt to have the Act declared unconstitutional.\n\nIn the second case, which was consolidated from two cases by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, the City of New York and several organizations related to health care alleged injury from President Clinton's cancellation of certain provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that eliminated certain liabilities, and Snake River Potato Growers, Inc. alleged injury from the President's cancellation of certain provisions of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 that gave tax benefits to aid farmer's cooperatives in purchasing potato processing facilities.\n\nThe District Court ruled for the plaintiffs, holding that the Line Item Veto Act was unconstitutional. Because the Act established an expedited appeal process for challenges, the case was directly appealed from the District Court to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a majority opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens, the Court ruled that because the Act allowed the President to unilaterally amend or repeal parts of duly enacted statutes by using line-item cancellations, it violated the Presentment Clause of the Constitution, which outlines a specific practice for enacting a statute. The Court construed the silence of the Constitution on the subject of such unilateral Presidential action as equivalent to \"an express prohibition\", agreeing with historical material that supported the conclusion that statutes may only be enacted \"in accord with a single, finely wrought and exhaustively considered, procedure\", and that a bill must be approved or rejected by the President in its entirety.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy, in an opinion concurring in the opinion and judgment of the Court, objected to the dissent's argument that the Act did not violate principles of the separation of powers and threaten individual liberty, stating that the \"undeniable effects\" of the Act were to \"enhance the President's power to reward one group and punish another, to help one set of taxpayers and hurt another, to favor one State and ignore another\". Kennedy's concurrence implicitly viewed the statute as a violation of the nondelegation doctrine.\n\nIn a dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen Breyer contended that the objective of the Act was constitutionally proper and was consistent with powers that the President has held in the past, stating that the Act \"does not violate any specific textual constitutional command, nor does it violate any implicit Separation of Powers principle\". He extensively refers to many different cases which support the delegation of power by the Congress, and primarily suggests that the Act is an efficient means by which a constitutionally legitimate end may be achieved.\n\nIn an alternative opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia objected to the Court's consideration of the case with respect to the Taxpayer Relief Act, finding no party in the case with standing to challenge it. However, he did find a party with standing to challenge the President's cancellation in the Balanced Budget Act, and concluded that it did not violate the Constitution, because the Congress has the power to delegate the discretionary authority to decline to spend appropriated sums of money, which he asserted was equivalent to cancellation.\n\nMichael B. Rappaport argued that the original meaning of the Constitution does not apply to certain parts of the nondelegation doctrine, relying on his interpretation of the Executive Power Vesting Clause. Under this view, \"laws that authorize the withdrawal of money from the treasury and which have traditionally taken the form of authorizing a certain amount to be spent for particular programs ... are not subject to the nondelegation doctrine\". He further criticized the majority opinion for failing to satisfactorily justify its application of a stricter standard to the delegation of cancellation authority than it had used in the past for other executive delegations. In Rappaport’s opinion, \"the Court’s approach to cancellation authority has no basis in text, structure and purpose, or precedent\".\nJ.Stephen Kennedy wrote that the majority of the Supreme Court was sufficiently concerned with the constitutional challenges to the line item veto presented to declare the act wholly unconstitutional, instead of relying on other traditional and less sweeping ways of correcting acts of Congress. In his view, \"the Court’s decision sent a clear message of finality for any future use of the line item veto\". Kennedy also noted that while the majority relied on a strict interpretation or literal textual reading of the Presentment Clause contained in Article I of the United States Constitution, Justice Scalia, in his dissent, \"stray[ed] somewhat from his usual strict constructionist approach ... by stressing that the President's act of cancellation would only occur after satisfaction of the Presentment Clause\".\n\nSteven F. Huefner wrote that \"Although the Presentment Clause analysis of the Line Item Veto Act has superficial appeal, it ultimately does not withstand scrutiny\", arguing that the Court should have relied on the nondelegation doctrine in order to invalidate the Act, as it provided a superior basis for such a decision. Huefner named two main implications of the Court’s refusal to use the nondelegation doctrine. First, it suggests that the Court seems unready or unwilling to alter the existing interpretation of the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the Court has shown that it is willing to rely upon alternative rationales to achieve the same result \"as would a more robust nondelegation doctrine rationale\". This approach is significant because in theory, such a rationale could endanger previously accepted delegations to the executive.\n\nRoy E. Brownell II criticized the Clinton administration for its exercise of the Line Item Veto Act, charging that it should have restricted its cancellation powers only to statutory provisions that remain in the realm of national security. He argued that had the Clinton administration limited its use of the Line Item Veto Act in this fashion, it would have ensured that when the constitutionality of the Act was inevitably challenged, the challenge would have been based on terms most favorable to the Executive. Brownell suggested that a test case brought forth on the grounds of national security would have likely acknowledged the existence of \"National Security Rescission\", \"a narrow statutory construction limiting the area of presidential cancellation power to within the field of national security. Such a result ... would have assured that the President maintained cancellation authority over a sixth of the federal budget.\"\n\nSteven G. Calabresi argued that although the Court had denied this, the instant decision was really a \"Nondelegation doctrine case masquerading as a bicameralism and presentment case\". He also suggested that this decision was \"the blockbuster separation of powers case of the Rehnquist years\".\n\nThough the Supreme Court struck down the Line Item Veto Act in 1998, President George W. Bush asked Congress to enact legislation that would return the line item veto power to the Executive. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006 State of the Union address, President Bush sent a legislative proposal Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 to Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage. Senator Bill Frist, Senator John McCain, and Republican Whip Senator Mitch McConnell jointly introduced this proposal.\n\nOn that same day, Joshua Bolten, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, gave a press conference on the president's line-item veto proposal. Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out \"wasteful\" spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to rescind the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis, and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.\n\nWhen asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line Item Veto Act that was found unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, in order for the President to successfully rescind previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.\n\nThough the newer line-item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless failed to find strong support in Congress. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia called it \"an offensive slap at Congress\", asserting that the legislation would enable the president to intimidate individual members of Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed would take away Congress' constitutional \"power of the purse\" and give it to the executive branch.\n\nOn June 8, 2006, Viet D. Dinh, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, and Nathan Sales, John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center testified by written statement before the House Committee on the Budget on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation. Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution's Bicameralism and Presentment Clause, and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.\n\nThe proposed Act was approved by the House Budget Committee on June 14, 2006 by a vote of 24–9. It was approved in the full House on June 22. A similar bill was submitted in the Senate, but failed to win approval. The Legislative Line Item Veto Act has therefore not become law.\n\n"}
{"id": "49120940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49120940", "title": "Consular nonreviewability", "text": "Consular nonreviewability\n\nConsular nonreviewability (sometimes written as consular non-reviewability, and also called consular absolutism) refers to the doctrine in immigration law in the United States where the visa decisions made by United States consular officers (Foreign Service Officers working for the United States Department of State) cannot be appealed in the United States judicial system. It is closely related to the plenary power doctrine that immunizes from judicial review the substantive immigration decisions of the United States Congress and the executive branch of the United States government.\n\nSince the alien denied entry at a consulate abroad was not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, it is not \"a priori\" clear whether the alien has standing to sue in the US justice system. However, the principle of consular nonreviewability goes further than simply denying aliens standing; it also creates a strong presumption against judicial review of consular decisions requested by United States citizens and residents affected by them.\n\nConsular nonreviewability specifically applies to decisions made by consular officers representing the United States in other countries, who are employees of the United States Department of State. It does not apply to decisions made by United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nFor many immigrant and non-immigrant visas, the approval of a petition or application from the USCIS is a prerequisite for obtaining the visa. However, the visa may be denied despite the USCIS application having been approved, and consular nonreviewability insulates such decisions from challenge. For instance, in the case of \"Kerry v. Din\" (2015) the applicant whose visa was denied had gotten USCIS approval through a Form I-130 filed by his wife, but his visa was nonetheless denied and the United States government claimed that detailed explanation of the reason of denial was not necessary.\n\nConsular nonreviewability also does not apply to decisions made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers when deciding whether to allow an alien to enter or not enter the United States at a designated port of entry, or to immigration enforcement actions taken by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. However, in practice, the avenues of legal redress for the actions of these agencies are limited, owing to the plenary power doctrine.\n\nConsular nonreviewability does not mean that the Department of State cannot reconsider its immigration decisions. There are a number of avenues for redress within the Department of State for somebody whose visa is denied.\n\n\nThe Code of Federal Regulations states that all non-immigrant visa denials should be reviewed by a supervisor. However, the Foreign Affairs Manual states that as many refusals as practical, but not fewer than 20%, should be reviewed, as soon as possible, but deferrable by up to 120 days if the applicant wishes to submit additional evidence. For immigrant visa applications, the review must take place as soon as administratively feasible (but within 30 days) unless the applicant wishes to submit additional evidence (in which case there is no time limit). Supervisorial review of 214(b) refusals (failure to establish non-immigrant intent) require the supervisor to re-interview the applicant.\n\nIn some limited circumstances, the decisions of consular officers may be appealed within the consulate. However, there are no procedural guarantees of this.\n\nA few exceptions to the doctrine of consular nonreviewability have emerged over the years:\n\n\nSince it almost by definition excludes judicial review, cases challenging the doctrine of consular nonreviewability are heard quite rarely in court. However, the doctrine has evolved somewhat in response to court challenges.\n\nSome important precedents regarding judicial reviewability of immigration decisions were set in the aftermath of the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and Immigration Act of 1882. The Chinese Exclusion Act was the first federal immigration act to significantly affect migration flows, and the Immigration Act of 1882 gave enforcement teeth to this law by making immigration enforcement a federal matter. At this time, the determination regarding whether an alien could enter the United States was by the officer at the designated port of entry. When the officer decided not to admit the alien, the alien was generally detained on the vessel he or she had arrived on and then returned to his or her home country by the captain of the vessel. Since the vessel would generally be harbored in the United States prior to departure, the alien could file a writ of \"habeas corpus\" and have his or her refusal challenged in court, at least in principle. A few such cases shortly after the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Act helped delineate the scope of judicial review for decisions on whether to admit an alien.\n\nThe most significant case was \"Chae Chan Ping v. United States\" (1889), also called the Chinese Exclusion Case. Chae Chan Ping, a Chinese-born United States resident was denied re-entry to the United States after a trip to China, in accordance with the Scott Act, which had passed after his departure to China but prior to his return arrival. He filed a lawsuit against the United States government, and lost. In its decision, the Supreme Court wrote that the power to exclude foreigners rested with the executive branch of the government, and any international grievances arising from this were the province of the political department of the government.\n\nOther cases that occurred in subsequent years further strengthened the plenary power doctrine, though they related to the authority to deny entry and deport people and did not address consular decisions. These included \"Fong Yue Ting v. United States\" (1893), \"Lem Moon Sing v. United States\" (1895), and \"United States v. Ju Toy\" (1905).\n\nPrior to World War I, passports and visas were not necessary to enter the United States at a designated port of entry. In 1917 (during World War I), the United States Department of State and United States Department of Labor issued a joint order to diplomatic, consular, and immigration officers requiring that noncitizens have a passport and visa before seeking entry to the United States. In 1918, these requirements were made long-term by the United States Congress. Initially, consular officers issuing visas did not check for grounds of inadmissibility; rather, they simply issued the visa and informed the applicant of potential grounds for inadmissibility, leaving the task of determining inadmissibility to the officer at the port of entry. This led to the problem of people undertaking an expensive journey and then being rejected at the port of entry. In 1924, Congress enacted a provision requiring consular officers to make a determination of admissibility and issue the visa only if they were satisfied. While the officer at the border still had final say on whether to admit the alien (i.e., the alien could be denied entry despite having a valid visa), the visa served an important prior screening and filtering role.\n\nAt the same time, the United States moved in the direction of more comprehensive restrictions on immigration from around the world. Specifically, the Emergency Quota Act of 1921 restricted annual immigration from a country to no more than 3% of the population of people from that country in the United States as of the U.S. Census of 1910; the Immigration Act of 1924 (The Johnson-Reed Act) further reduced this to 2%. While this effectively limited immigration from most countries to lower than the levels at that time, the primary purpose of the law was to clamp down on immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe. It also significantly affected immigration from Africa and Asia.\n\nThe combination of the increased degree of immigration restriction and the shifting of immigration decisions towards consulates abroad gave consular decisions considerable significance.\n\nTwo cases in the immediate aftermath of the Immigration Act of 1924 have been cited as precedents for consular nonreviewability:\n\n\nPrior to 1946, there was no barrier in principle to judicial review of consular decisions, but there was no clear protocol in general for challenging decisions by government agencies in courts. The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 changed this; Section 10 of the APA permitted judicial review for any person \"adversely affected or aggrieved\" by the actions of a government agency. Also, Section 279 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 explicitly gave the courts jurisdiction over \"all causes\" arising under Title II of the statute. This meant that cases would be brought to the courts the decisions on which would help clarify their thinking on consular nonreviewability.\n\nCourts' initial response to efforts to challenge consular decisions was to rely on the plenary power doctrine. The first decision establishing the plenary power doctrine in the post-APA era was \"Knauff v. Shaughnessy\" (1950). According to the \"Knauff\" court, \"whatever the procedure authorized by Congress, it is due process as far as an alien denied entry is concerned.\"\n\nIn this case, Knauff, the alien wife of a citizen who had served for the United States in World War II sought admission to the United States (and would ordinarily have been eligible based on the War Brides Act), but was denied admission by the United States based on confidential information. The Attorney General denied a hearing, arguing that a hearing would reveal sensitive information that would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. The Supreme Court upheld the Attorney General's decision, clarifying that the denial of entry to the alien wife was not unconstitutional, and that it is \"not within the province of any court, unless expressly authorized by law, to review the determination of the political branch of Government to exclude a certain alien.\"\n\nTwo other court decisions at the time played some role in establishing the doctrine of consular nonreviewability:\n\n\n\"Kleindienst v. Mandel\", 408 U.S 753 (172) was a United States Supreme Court decision that upheld that the United States Attorney General has the right to refuse somebody's entry to the United States, as he has been empowered to do so in 212 (a) (28) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.\n\nThis action was brought to compel Attorney General Kleindienst to grant a temporary nonimmigrant visa to a Belgian journalist and Marxian theoretician whom the American plaintiff-appellees, Ernest Mandel et al., had invited to participate in academic conferences and discussions in the US. The alien had been found ineligible for admission under 212 (a) (28) (D) and (G) (v) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, barring those who advocate or publish \"the economic, international, and governmental doctrines of world communism.\" Kleindienst had declined to waive ineligibility as he has the power to do under 212 (d) of the Act, basing his decision on unscheduled activities engaged in by the alien on a previous visit to the United States, when a waiver was granted.\n\nEven though it upheld consular nonreviewability, the opinion offered in the Kleindienst v. Mandel case paved the way for potential challenges to consular decisions. Specifically, Kleindienst v. Mandel rejected judicial review because it ruled that the consulate had offered a \"bona fide and facially legitimate\" reason for rejecting the visa. This suggested that in cases where such a reason was not provided, the consular decision may be subject to judicial review. This criterion for whether a consular decision might be eligible for judicial review would come to be known as the Mandel test.\n\n\"Kerry v. Din\" (576 U.S. ___) (2015) was a United States Supreme Court decision that upheld the doctrine of consular nonreviewability. The case was filed by Fauzia Din, a United States citizen who had arrived in the country as a refugee from Afghanistan in 2000. In September 2006, she married Kanishka Berashk, a citizen of Afghanistan, who had worked as a civil servant under the Taliban regime. Din then submitted a Form I-130 petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, sponsoring Berashk under the Immediate Relative category. The petition was approved by the USCIS.\n\nBerashk used the approved Form I-130 to apply for a visa to enter the United States. However, in June 2009, he was informed that his visa was denied; the stated reason for the denial was that he had provided material support to a terrorist but no further details were provided. Din filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California arguing that the government denied her due process of law by depriving her of her \"constitutional right to live in the United States with her spouse.\" The District Court rejected her argument, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. The United States appealed the reversal in the Supreme Court. Per the \"Mandel\" test, there were two questions at hand:\n\n\nThe case was won by the United States, with the Supreme Court split in its opinion. Antonin Scalia, John G. Roberts, and Clarence Thomas wrote plurality opinions. Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito concurred.\n\nScalia's opinion rejected (1), i.e., he argued that the denial of a visa did not implicate a fundamental liberty interest, and that it differed from \"Loving v. Virginia\" in that the right to marriage was not being questioned. Kennedy's opinion differed from Scalia's in that he did not come to a definite conclusion regarding (1), but instead he rejected (2), arguing that even if Din's liberty was infringed upon, the reason explanation offered by the consulate for the denial (i.e., that Berashk had provided material support to a terrorist organization) fulfilled the government's obligations, and that further details were not required in cases where the application was denied due to terrorism or national security concerns.\n\nStephen Breyer wrote a dissenting opinion answering both (1) and (2) in the affirmative, in which he was joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Scalia's opinion argued that Kennedy's concurrence argued that the On the other hand, Breyer's dissent argued that forbidding people from living together did effectively impede the right to marry, and that the level of explanation offered for the denial was inadequate, similar to \"telling a criminal defendant that he is accused of breaking the law.\"\n\nAlthough \"Kerry v. Din\" upheld the doctrine of consular nonreviewability, legal commentators viewed it as not carrying much additional weight as a precedent since the decision was based on only a slight majority (5-4) and even those ruling in favor of the United States offered different reasons.\n\n"}

The term was coined by Warren C. Sanderson in 2007. Under a Demeny voting system, each parent would cast a proxy vote, worth half a vote, for each of their dependent children, thus allowing for a split vote if the parents' political views differ. Once children reach the minimum voting age, their parents would no longer vote on their behalf.\n\nDemeny voting is named after demographer Paul Demeny, who came up with the idea in 1986. Demeny argued that children \"should not be left disenfranchised for some 18 years: let custodial parents exercise the children's voting rights until they come of age\". Demeny's motivation behind proposing such a system was to \"make the political system more responsive to the young generation's interests\" and was part of a broader set of policy proposals aimed at combating the low fertility rate in certain countries.\n\nThe idea, however, is older than Demeny's idea; it was regularly discussed in France in the 1920s and was almost adopted by the National Assembly.\n\nIn Germany the idea was even first discussed in the 1910s. In the 1970s and the 1980s lawyers and political scientists began a discussion which is still going on. In\n2003 and 2008 the German parliament had votes on whether to introduce a \"Kinderwahlrecht\" (which is the term in German), but the proposals were defeated. In 2011 Hermann started a comprehensive economic approach to discuss it.\n\nPieter Vanhuysse (head of research and Deputy Director at the European Centre for Social Welfare Policy and Research, Vienna) argued in 2013 that in Austria, where there are relatively strong pro-elderly policies, that \"the time is ripe for at least opening a clear-headed and empirically informed democratic debate about the radical idea of giving each parent one half extra vote, to be used on behalf of each under-age child until that child reaches legal voting age\".\n\nJapan has discussed Demeny voting as a possible answer to its aging population, which gives disproportionate voice to the elderly as a result of their increasing numbers. This follows the publication of a paper by Reiko Aoki of the Centre for Intergenerational Studies at Hitotsubashi University and Rhema Vaithianathan of the University of Auckland. On 2 March 2011, the Centre for Intergenerational Studies at Hitotsubashi University hosted a conference on Demeny voting. Aoki and Vaithianathan have also conducted a number of surveys on voter attitude to Demeny Voting and found that a considerable percentage of respondents would cast their children's vote differently to their own. In July 2013, Nikkei in Japan wrote a major editorial supporting the idea as part of a debate on constitutional reform in Japan.\n\nIn Hungary, the ruling coalition has been advocating Demeny voting, but admitted in April 2011 that it probably won't come into practice for some time.\n\nPaul Demeny discussed the idea on a CBC interview. Professor Miles Corak from the University of Ottawa has also written a blog on the idea and promoted it in Canada. He suggests that it is supported on a humanitarian basis since the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides that children be given civil and political rights. He suggests that given the evidence that households where mothers control the purse-strings spend more on their children, it is mothers who ought to be given the proxy vote until the child comes of age. Professor Corak's thesis has been taken up by journalist Chrystia Freeland .\n\nAoki and Vaithianathan argue that Demeny voting is justified because it reduces gerontocracy. They calculate that Demeny voting in Japan would increase the parent voting bloc to 37% and lower the over-55-year-old voter-bloc to 35%.\n\nStefan Olsson argues that \"the delegation of the children's right to vote is not any stranger than when adults delegate political authority to their elected representative. After the election, the representatives have the right to make use of this authority.\" (page 71). He suggests that delegating a child's authority to the parent is perfectly reasonable. Olsson also argues that there are other areas where parents are delegated authority such as what the child eats, where he goes to school, and children are regularly represented in a court of law by parents. He says that \"Arguing that parents cannot act as their children's representative because they might abuse their position becomes absurd in comparison to all the other powers parents already have over their children.\" (page 72).\n\nIt has been suggested it would make it harder for elderly voters to vote in governments that borrow money for social security but which will only be paid back by future generations. It may ensure that the needs of children, such as education, childcare, and healthcare, are better taken into account. It could also make governments more ecologically conscious as younger people will be more affected by poor environmental policy than older voters. Finally, extending the vote to children may increase their involvement in politics, encouraging children to grow up and be more active citizens.\n\nOpponents see Demeny voting as a violation of a fundamental normative principle of democracy: 'one person, one vote'. They point to the fact that children below the minimum voting age can hold different political opinions and thus prefer different parties to their parents. There is no evidence that parents would split their votes. Instead, they would have plural votes for the same party they prefer (and have formerly preferred).\n\nSome writers argue that, like marrying or making a will, voting is an exercise of the informed will and cannot legitimately be done by proxy. Others have argued that with the right to vote comes other obligations of citizenship, such as military service. Since children do not have those obligations, it is argued they should also not have such rights. Some people worry that the power of older votes will be diluted and the interests of children might be prioritised above those of the elderly.\n\nYet others have argued that lowering the voting age to 13 or 14 or lower would be more beneficial, as many children are able to express complex opinions at that age.\nSome scholars advocate a 'flexible voting age' building on the willingness of minors to participate in elections. The ‘flexible voting age’ proposal contains a need for adolescents to register in voting lists and so differs from proposals that come under the name of ‘voting from birth on’ or ‘voting age zero’. It takes into account that infants, small children and many younger adolescents will have no interest in political participation. \n\nJon Elster has argued that if the justification for Demeny is on the basis of consequences, then said consequences should be voted on, rather than changing the voting demographic. His argument is that to advance Demeny voting on the grounds that it leads to desirable consequences is pointless, since it will be blocked by exactly those groups who will block the desired consequences (e.g. raising the pension age).\n"}

A tall (88 cm), cone-shaped object made of thin sheet gold, it is seen as belonging to a group of artifacts referred to as Bronze Age Golden hats. It was presumably worn by special functionaries on ceremonial occasions.\n\nThe Ezelsdorf-Buch cone is one of four such known items. Two of them were discovered in Southern Germany, one in the west of France, and one is without provenance, believed to have been found in Switzerland or Germany. It dates to \"circa\" 1,000 to 900 BC.\n\nParallels have been drawn between the golden 'hats' and depictions found on the Kivik slabs and on objects from the Stockhult hoard discovered in Scandinavia.\n\nThe 'hat', like its counterparts, is assumed to have served as a religious insignia for the deities or priests of a sun-cult common in Bronze Age Europe. The hats are also suggested to have served calendrical functions.\n\nThe Ezelsdorf-Buch Cone was discovered accidentally during the removal of tree-stumps in 1953. However, it was not recognised as an archaeological find immediately, and its top was torn and broken by digging tools, probably weakening or destroying the structure of the whole object. It is also possible that the object had been damaged previously or that it had fully or partially collapsed during burial. It was probably originally buried in an upright position, with its top relatively near ground level, as were its Berlin and Schifferstadt counterparts. After recovery, the cone was mutilated and torn into small scraps of sheet gold. Although it could be mostly reconstructed at an early stage, it was only in the 1990s that the find was understood as belonging to the group of \"golden hats\".\n\nIncluding the part now missing, the 'hat' would have weighed about 330 g. Like its counterparts, it was hammered from a single piece of gold, decorated in the repoussé technique with bands and rows of symbols, had a somewhat convex, cap-like, lower portion and was originally equipped with a 'brim', which was probably lost during its recovery. Like the Berlin example, it was reinforced by one or several bronze rings near the bottom.\n\nThe cone is now (in reconstructed form) 88.3 cm high, but was probably somewhat shorter, at 72 cm or more.\n\nAlong its whole length, the object's surface is subdivided and decorated by horizontal bands or ribs and by rows of symbols. In total, there are 154 bands and symbol rows. The symbols are mostly circular bosses enclosed by up to seven concentric circles, as known from all other specimens. There are three sets of unusual special motifs: small horizontal ovals resembling eyes (row 92, also known from Schifferstadt and Berlin), small eight-spoked wheels (row 120) and miniature cones (rows 127 and 105). The latter are unique to the Ezesldorf-Buch cone and appear to represent the shape of a gold 'hat'. The tip of the cone is embellished with a ten-point star. The area where the cone joins the cap-like area is embellished with a 30 mm wide band of vertical grooving, as is the case on the Berlin example.\n\nThe piece is hammered from a gold alloy; gold (88.3%), silver (11%), copper (0.59%) and tin (0.086%). Its average thickness is only 0.78 mm. The amount of gold used for making the object is equivalent to the size of a matchbox.\n\nTwenty different decorative punches, a comb, and six stamp-wheels or cylindrical stamps were used to apply the patterns. For a more detailed discussion of the cone's manufacture, see here.\n\nThe Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch is on display in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg.\n\n\n"}

The term originated from early Greek and Roman poets, who used it to refer to a time when mankind lived in a better time and was pure (see Golden Age).\n\nThe ancient Greek philosopher Hesiod introduced the term in his \"Works and Days\", when referring to the period when the \"Golden Race\" of man lived. This was part of fivefold division of Ages of Man, starting with the Golden age, then the Silver Age, the Bronze Age, the Age of Heroes (including the Trojan War), and finally, the current Iron Age. The concept was further refined by Ovid, in his \"Metamorphoses\", into the four \"metal ages\" (golden, silver, bronze, and iron).\n\nBy definition, the Golden Age is always in the past.\n\nThe Golden age as described by Hesiod was an age where all humans were created directly by the Olympian gods. They did not have women in their ranks, and could not reproduce. They lived long lives in peace and harmony, and were oblivious of death. The \"Golden race\" were however mortals, but would die peacefully and in their sleep unmarked by sickness and age. Ovid emphasizes the justice and peace that defined the Golden Age. He described it as a time before man learned the art of navigation, and as a pre-agricultural society. The idea of a Golden age lingered in literature and historical understanding throughout the Greek and Roman periods. It was partly replaced by the Christian Six Ages of the World based on the biblical chronology in the early Middle Ages.\n\nThe term \"Golden age\" has always had a metaphoric element. A few centuries after Hesiod, Plato pointed out that the \"Golden race\" were not made from gold as such, but that the term should be understood metaphorically. The classical idea of the \"metal ages\" as actual historical periods held sway throughout the Greek and Roman periods. While supplemented by St. Augustine's \"Six Ages of the World\", the classical ideas were never entirely eradicated, and it resurfaced to form the basis of division of time in early archaeology\n\nAt the birth of modern archaeology in the 18th century, the \"Golden age\" was associated with a pre-agricultural society. However, already in the 16th century, the term \"Golden age\" was replaced by \"Stone age\" in the three-age system. Still, Rousseau used the term for a loosely defined historical period characterized by the \"State of nature\" as late as the during the late 18th century. While the concept of an Iron and Bronze Age are still used by historians and archaeologists, the \"Golden age\" of Hesiod was a purely mythical period, and has come to signify any period in history where the state of affairs for a specific phenomenon appear to have been on their height, better than in the periods proceeding it and following the \"Golden Age\". It is sometimes still employed for the hunter-gatherer tribal societies of the Mesolithic, but only as a metaphor.\n\nA society's Golden Age marks that period in its history having a heightened output of art, science, literature, and philosophy.\n\n\n\nA golden age is often ascribed to the years immediately following some technological innovation. It is during this time that writers and artists ply their skills to this new medium. Therefore, there are Golden Ages of both radio and television. During this nascent phase the technology allows new ideas to be expressed, as new art forms flower quickly into new areas:\n\n\nAt least one technology had its \"Golden Age\" in its latter years:\n\nTechnology and creativity spawn new genres in literature and theatre. The onset of a new genre will be its Golden Age:\n\n\n\nCompanies will use \"Golden Age\" as a marketing euphemism to replace \"senior citizen\":\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "154176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=154176", "title": "Heritage railway", "text": "Heritage railway\n\nA heritage railway is a railway operated as living history to re-create or preserve railway scenes of the past. Heritage railways are often old railway lines preserved in a state depicting a period (or periods) in the history of rail transport.\n\nThe British Office of Rail and Road defines heritage railways as follows: \"...'lines of local interest', museum railways or tourist railways that have retained or assumed the character and appearance and operating practices of railways of former times. Several lines that operate in isolation provide genuine transport facilities, providing community links. Most lines constitute tourist or educational attractions in their own right. Much of the rolling stock and other equipment used on these systems is original and is of historic value in its own right. Many systems aim to replicate both the look and operating practices of historic former railways companies.\"\n\nHeritage railway lines have historic rail infrastructure which has been substituted (or made obsolete) in modern rail systems. Historical installations, such as hand-operated points, water cranes, and rails fastened with hand-hammered rail spikes, are characteristic features of heritage lines. Unlike tourist railways, which primarily carry tourists and have modern installations and vehicles, heritage-line infrastructure creates views and soundscapes of the past in operation.\n\nDue to a lack of modern technology or the desire for historical accuracy, railway operations can be handled with traditional practices such as the use of tokens. Heritage infrastructure and operations often require the assignment of roles, based on historical occupations, to the railway staff. Station masters and signalmen, sometimes wearing period-appropriate attire, can be seen on some heritage railways. Most heritage railways use heritage rolling stock, although modern rail vehicles can be used to showcase railway scenes with historical-line infrastructure. \nWhile some heritage railways are profitable tourist attractions, many are not-for-profit entities; some of the latter depend on enthusiastic volunteers for upkeep and operations to supplement revenue from traffic and visitors. Still other heritage railways offer a viable public-transit option, and can maintain operations with revenue from regular riders or government subsidies.\n\nChildren's railways are extracurricular educational institutions where children and teenagers learn about railway work; they are often functional, passenger-carrying narrow-gauge rail lines. The railways developed in the USSR during the Soviet era. Many were called \"Pioneer railways\", after the youth organisation of that name. The first children's railway opened in Moscow in 1932 and, at the breakup of the USSR, 52 children's railways existed in the country. Although the fall of communist governments has led to the closure of some, preserved children's railways are still functioning in post-Soviet states and Eastern European countries.\n\nMany children's railways were built on parkland in urban areas. Unlike many industrial areas typically served by a narrow-gauge railway, parks were free of redevelopment. Child volunteers and socialist fiscal policy enabled the existence of many of these railways. Children's railways which still carry traffic have often retained their original infrastructure and rolling stock, including vintage steam locomotives; some have acquired heritage vehicles from other railways.\n\nExamples of children's railways with steam locomotives include the Dresden Park Railway in Germany; the Gyermekvasút in Budapest; the Park Railway Maltanka in Poznań; the Košice Children's Railway in Slovakia, and the gauge steam railway on the grounds of St Nicholas' School in Merstham, Surrey, which the children help operate with assistance from the East Surrey 16mm Group and other volunteers.\n\nCreating passages for trains up steep hills and through mountain regions offers many obstacles which call for technical solutions. Steep grade railway technologies and extensive tunneling may be employed. The use of narrow gauge allows tighter curves in the track, and offers a smaller structure gauge and tunnel size. At high altitudes, construction and logistical difficulties, limited urban development and demand for transport and special rolling-stock requirements have left many mountain railways unmodernized. The engineering feats of past railway builders and views of pristine mountain scenes have made many railways in mountainous areas profitable tourist attractions.\n\nPit railways have been in operation in underground mines all over the world. Small rail vehicles transport ore, waste rock, and workers through narrow tunnels. Sometimes trains were the sole mode of transport in the passages between the work sites and the mine entrance. The railway's loading gauge often dictated the cross-section of passages to be dug. At many mining sites, pit railways have been abandoned due to mine closure or adoption of new transportation equipment. Some show mines have a vintage pit railway and offer mantrip rides into the mine.\n\nThe Metro 1 (officially the Millennium Underground Railway or M1), built from 1894 to 1896, is the oldest line of the Budapest Metro system and the second-oldest underground railway in the world. The M1 underwent major reconstruction during the 1980s and 1990s, and Line 1 now serves eight original stations whose original appearance has been preserved. In 2002, the line was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the Deák Ferenc Square concourse's Millennium Underground Museum, many other artifacts of the metro's early history may be seen.\n\nIn Britain, heritage railways are often railway lines which were run as commercial railways but were no longer needed (or closed down) and were taken over—or re-opened—by volunteers or non-profit organisations. A typical British heritage railway will use steam locomotives and original rolling stock to create a period atmosphere, although some are concentrating on diesel and electric traction to re-create the post-steam era. Many run seasonally on partial routes, unconnected to a larger network (or railway), and charge high fares in comparison with transit services; as a result, they focus on the tourist and leisure markets. During the 1990s and 2000s, however, some heritage railways aimed to provide local transportation and extend their running seasons to carry commercial passenger traffic.\n\nAfter the founding of the Edaville Railroad in Massachusetts by Ellis D. Atwood in 1947, the first heritage railway to be rescued and run entirely by volunteers was the Talyllyn Railway in Wales. This narrow gauge line, taken over by a group of enthusiasts in 1950, was the beginning of the preservation movement in the United Kingdom. The world's third preserved railway, and the second outside the United Kingdom, was Australia's Puffing Billy Railway. This railway operates on of track, with much of its original rolling stock built as early as 1898. There are 100 to 150 heritage railways in the United Kingdom, and similar railway-preservation efforts by enthusiasts can be found in many other countries in Europe and the Commonwealth.\n\nThe large number of heritage railways in the UK is due in part to the closure of many minor lines during the 1960s' Beeching cuts, and they were relatively easy to revive. The first standard-gauge line to be preserved (not a victim of Beeching) was the Middleton Railway; the second, and the first to carry passengers, was the Bluebell Railway.\n\nNot-for-profit heritage railways differ in their quantity of service. Although the Puffing Billy Railway provides more service than it did in its pre-preservation working life, some lines see traffic only on summer weekends. The more successful, such as the Severn Valley Railway and the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, may have up to five or six steam locomotives and operate a four-train service daily; smaller railways may run daily throughout the summer with only one steam locomotive. The Great Central Railway, the only preserved British main line with a double track, can operate over 50 trains on a busy timetable day.\n\nAfter the privatisation of main-line railways, the line between not-for-profit heritage railways and for-profit branch lines may be blurred. The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway is an example of a commercial line run as a heritage operation and to provide local transportation, and the Severn Valley Railway has operated a few goods trains commercially. A number of heritage railway lines are regularly used by commercial freight operators.\n\nSince the Bluebell Railway reopened to traffic in 1960, the definition of private standard gauge railways in the United Kingdom as preserved railways has evolved as the number of projects and their length, operating days and function have changed. The situation is further muddied by large variations in ownership-company structure, rolling stock and other assets. Unlike community railways, tourist railways in the UK are vertically integrated (although those operating mainly as charities separate their charitable and non-charitable activities for accounting purposes).\n\nThe Čierny Hron Railway is a narrow-gauge railway in central Slovakia, established in the first decade of the 20th century and operating primarily as a freight railway for the local logging industry. From the late 1920s to the early 1960s, it also offered passenger transport between the villages of Hronec and Čierny Balog. The railway became Czechoslovakia's most extensive forest railway network. After its closure in 1982, it received heritage status and was restored during the following decade. Since 1992, it has been one of Slovakia's official heritage railways and is a key regional tourist attraction. The Historical Logging Switchback Railway in Vychylovka is a heritage railway in north-central Slovakia, originally built to serve the logging industry in the Orava and Kysuce regions. Despite a closure and dissasembly of most of its original network during the early 1970s, its surviving lines and branches have been (or are being) restored. The railway is owned and operated by the Museum of Kysuce, with a line open to tourists for sightseeing.\n\nOn the Finnish state-owned rail network, the section between Olli and Porvoo is a dedicated museum line. In southern Finland, it is the only line with many structural details abandoned by the rest of the network which regularly carries passenger traffic. Wooden sleepers, gravel ballast and low rail weight with no overhead catenary make it uniquely historical. Along the line, the Hinthaara railway station and the Porvoo railway station area are included in the National Board of Antiquities' inventory of cultural environments of national significance in Finland. Also on the list is scenery in the Porvoonjoki Valley, through which the line passes.\n\nThe Jokioinen Museum Railway is a stretch of preserved narrow-gauge railway between Humppila and Jokioinen. Nykarleby Järnväg is a stretch of rebuilt narrow-gauge railway on the bank of the old Kovjoki–Nykarleby line.\n\nHeritage railways are known in the United States as tourist, historic, or scenic railroads. Most are remnants of original railroads, and some are reconstructed after having been scrapped. Some heritage railways preserve entire railroads in their original state using original structures, track, and motive power.\n\nExamples of heritage railroads in the US by preservation type:\nSome do not fit in the above categories, like the Rio Grande Scenic Railroad (a subsidiary of the San Luis & Rio Grande Railroad). The SL&RG, primarily a freight operation on former Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad track, owns and operates a steam locomotive and a fleet of passenger cars (most of which are painted in D&RGW colors). Many heritage railways host living-history events such as annual reenactments of historic activities, and may have an archive or library of railroad-related materials.\n\nLa Trochita (officially Viejo Expreso Patagónico, the Old Patagonian Express)\nwas declared a National Historic Monument by the Government of Argentina in 1999. Trains on the Patagonian narrow-gauge railway use steam locomotives. The railway runs through the foothills of the Andes between Esquel and El Maitén in Chubut Province and Ingeniero Jacobacci in Río Negro Province.\n\nIn southern Argentina, the Train of the End of the World to the Tierra del Fuego National Park is considered the world's southernmost functioning railway. Heritage railway operations started in 1994, after restoration of the old (narrow-gauge) steam railway.\n\nIn Salta Province in northeastern Argentina, the Tren a las Nubes (Train to the Clouds) runs along of track in what is one of the highest railways in the world. The line has 29 bridges, 21 tunnels, 13 viaducts, two spirals and two zigzags, and its highest point is above sea level. The Villa Elisa Historic Train (operated by Ferroclub Central Entrerriano) runs steam trains between the cities of Villa Elisa and Caseros in Entre Ríos Province, covering in 120 minutes.\n\nOf the mountain railways of India, the Darjeeling Himalayan, Nilgiri Mountain and Kalka–Shimla Railways have been collectively designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. To meet World Heritage criteria, the sites must retain some of their traditional infrastructure and culture.\n\nSeries three of \"Survivors\" uses heritage railways to help reestablish transportation, communication and trade in post-apocalyptic England.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29254569", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29254569", "title": "Insheeption", "text": "Insheeption\n\n\"Insheeption\" is the tenth episode of the fourteenth season of animated television series \"South Park\", and the 205th episode of the series overall. It premiered October 20, 2010 on Comedy Central in the United States. In the episode, Stan and Mr. Mackey suffer a hoarding disorder. In an attempt to find the cause for it, they get trapped in Mr. Mackey's dream. The episode spoofs the TV show \"Hoarders\" and the film \"Inception.\"\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA LV in the United States and MA15+(a) in Australia.\n\nAfter Wendy expresses concern that Stan suffers from compulsive hoarding, he agrees to have it checked. A hoarding specialist named Dr. Chinstrap, as well as the rest of the student body, help Stan go through his locker, which is quite stuffed with a number of disgusting items, including a maggot-infested sandwich and broken toothbrush which Stan, who soon loses his composure, refuses to give up, shocking Kyle, Kenny, Cartman, and the rest of the school. They send him to Mr. Mackey, who does not know what hoarding is; Stan discovers that Mackey is a hoarder himself. (Mr. Mackey also refuses to give up his items too)\nStan and Mackey, along with a sheep herder named Mr. Yelman (repeatedly misidentified as a sheep \"hoarder\"), are hooked up to a machine which Chinstrap and his assistant Dr. Pinkerton explains that they will help them figure out why they are hoarders by drifting them to their subconscious. Moments later in Mackey's subconscious he is being bullied by a boy named Billy Thompson, who threatens to attack Mackey at a field trip the next day. Mackey then runs into Stan and the sheep hoarder who, as the scientists explain in reality, are there because of the power of Mackey's dream. Within the dream, Stan goes home with Mackey and tries to talk him out of the dream, but Mackey instead plays with his Lite-Brite and old toys and watches \"ZOOM\". Randy insists he has to rescue his son from the dream despite Chinstrap's warning that he will be stuck there forever.\n\nThe dream moves on to the next morning where Stan, Mackey, the sheep hoarder, and the kids board a bus for the field trip. Stan suddenly sees Randy, who is for some reason a butterfly. Stan asks if he has come to help but Randy reveals that, while that was his intention, he is more concerned with getting \"butterfly poon\". Pinkerton claims that they have called in another group of \"experts\" in the form of the main characters from \"Inception\" (one of them shapeshifting into NFL quarterback Matt Hasselbeck) to go into the dream to create a \"dream within a dream\" and rescue them, with Chinstrap providing boombox sounds recreating \"Inception\"'s music theme during the explanation. The second group, the cast from \"Inception\", comes in shooting at people before going into the dream, where they proceed to shoot even more people in the woods as the group arrives. Stan, the sheep hoarder and Mackey are introduced to Woodsy Owl, an owl with the tagline \"give a hoot, don't pollute\" before being put in with Billy and his two friends.\n\nChinstrap and Pinkerton are now seen courting firefighters to get into the dream and begin trying to explain the events to Sharon (Compared to a taco inside of a taco inside a Taco Bell inside a KFC within a mall inside a dream), who claims it all sounds ridiculous and stupid. A pizza guy arrives and is sent in as well, as Sharon is told she does not understand because she is not smart. Within the dream, Mackey and Stan are running from the bullies when Stan convinces Mackey to stand up for himself. Mackey prepares for a fight. Back in reality, Chinstrap decides the dream has become too powerful, and at this point they must court \"the most powerful dream infiltrator in the world\" who is Freddy Krueger. While Freddy Krueger does not wish to come back, they convince him to help out a final time.\n\nWithin Mackey's dream, the second group of experts arrive to kill Billy Thompson and the tormentors before the fire fighters arrive, which they assumed would cure Mackey and end the dream. But when they realized Mackey's not waking up, he remembers what happened, explaining he ran from the bullies and went into a shack, where someone talked nice to him but then touched him in a bad way. Mackey then comes upon that same shack and enters, revealing another young Mackey being sexually molested by Woodsy Owl. Woodsy then turns into a nightmarish monster, killing the sheep hoarder and overpowering the Inception cast before being killed from behind by Freddy Krueger. With Woodsy destroyed, everyone wakes up and Mackey explains he must have become a hoarder because of Woodsy's tagline about not polluting. Freddy expresses remorse because he could not save the sheep herder (ironically the only one who recognizes him correctly as a shepherd). They suggest to Stan that he move on to his own therapy now, but he claims to have a better idea. He is then seen throwing out the items in his locker. Wendy and Kyle ask him what his problem was and Stan says that after what happened with Mackey, he does not want any therapy. Kyle suggests that maybe that \"was your therapy\". Finally, Chinstrap comes out again doing the \"Inception\" soundtrack as the episode ends.\n\nUpon the episode's release, Dan Gurewitch from the humor website CollegeHumor, noted several similarities between \"Insheeption\" and his own \"Inception\" parody video, \"Inception Characters Don't Understand Inception\", which he had made with David Young and first posted to the CollegeHumor website on July 19, 2010. He discovered that many lines from the \"South Park\" episode seemed to be lifted almost verbatim from their sketch. Matt Stone later issued an apology, admitting when they had intended to parody the complexity of \"Inception\", they did not have a copy of the film to reference, instead turning to the internet for information on the film. Stone explained:\n\n\"We thought their joke was that a lot of those lines were actually in the movie, and they were banging them against each other, and showing that the \"Inception\" characters didn't even know \"Inception\". That was a mistake, and it was an honest mistake… It's just because we do the show in six days, and we're stupid and we just threw it together. But in the end, there are some lines that we had to call and apologize for.\"\n\nGurewitch has since said that their apology was accepted, and that he and Young plan to \"meet up with Matt and Trey when they're in New York.\"\n\n\nIn its original American broadcast on October 20, 2010, \"Insheeption\" was seen by 2.891 million viewers according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the most watched cable television show of the night. The episode received a 1.8 rating/3 share, meaning it was seen by 1.8 percent of the population, and 3 percent of people watching television at the time of its broadcast. Among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49, the episode received a 1.6 rating/5 share, dropping three tenths in the ratings in stated demographic since the previous episode. Among male viewers between ages 18 and 34, the episode scored a 3.4 rating/11 share.\n\nTodd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B rating.\n\nIGN gave the episode a score of 7 out of 10 and wrote: \"This episode had a great premise, and I did find myself laughing a couple of times (Cartman's few lines in this story are hilarious), but this installment gave me the impression that the creative team weren't really trying that hard. I've said it before, but it bears repeating – it seems like these new episodes are more like Robot Chicken fare (no offense to you RC lovers out there, though South Park is not to be compared to Robot Chicken), than the usual stuff we've come to expect from SP. Maybe the team is distracted by other things, or maybe the debacle with the Mohammed episode took some wind out of their sails, but the spark seems to be missing, and I'm hoping it returns soon.\"\n\n\"TVfanatic.com\" rated the episode 4 out of 5 and said, \"We thought the episode was actually pretty spot on and fantastic.\"\n\n\"Insheeption\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"'s fourteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.\n\n"}
{"id": "2329664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2329664", "title": "Jean Leclerc (theologian)", "text": "Jean Leclerc (theologian)\n\nJean Le Clerc, also Johannes Clericus (March 19, 1657 in Geneva – January 8, 1736 in Amsterdam), was a Genevan theologian and biblical scholar. He was famous for promoting exegesis, or critical interpretation of the Bible, and was a radical of his age. He parted with Calvinism over his interpretations and left Geneva for that reason.\n\nHis father, Stephen Le Clerc, was professor of Greek in Geneva. The family originally belonged to the neighborhood of Beauvais in France, and several of its members acquired some name in literature. Jean Le Clerc applied himself to the study of philosophy under Jean-Robert Chouet (1642-1731) the Cartesian, and attended the theological lectures of Philippe Mestrezat, François Turrettini and Louis Tronchin () (1629-1705). In 1678-1679 he spent some time in Grenoble as tutor in a private family; on his return to Geneva he passed his examinations and received ordination. Soon afterwards he went to Saumur.\n\nIn 1682 he went to London, where he remained for six months, preaching on alternate Sundays in the Walloon church and in the Savoy Chapel. Due to political instability, he moved to Amsterdam, where he was introduced to John Locke and to Philipp van Limborch, professor at the Remonstrant college. He later included Locke in the journals he edited; and the acquaintance with Limborch soon ripened into a close friendship, which strengthened his preference for the Remonstrant theology, already favorably known to him by the writings of his grand-uncle, Stephan Curcellaeus (d. 1645) and by those of Simon Episcopius.\n\nA last attempt to live at Geneva, made at the request of relatives there, satisfied him that the theological atmosphere was uncongenial, and in 1684 he finally settled in Amsterdam, first as a moderately successful preacher, until ecclesiastical jealousy reportedly shut him out from that career, and afterwards as professor of philosophy, belles-lettres and Hebrew in the Remonstrant seminary. This appointment, which he owed to Limborch, he held from 1684, and in 1725 on the death of his friend he was called to occupy the chair of church history also.\n\nApart from literary work, Le Clerc's life at Amsterdam was uneventful. In 1691 he married a daughter of Gregorio Leti. From 1728 onward he was subject to repeated strokes of paralysis, and he died 8 years later, on 8 January.\n\nHis suspected Socinianism was the cause, it is said, of his exclusion from the chair of dogmatic theology.\n\nIn 1679 in Saumur were published \"Liberii de Sancto Amore Epistolae Theologicae\" (Irenopoli: Typis Philalethianis), usually attributed to Leclerc. They deal with the doctrine of the Trinity, the Hypostatic union of the two natures in Jesus Christ, original sin, and other topics, in a manner unorthodox for the period. In 1685 he published with Charles Le Cène \"Entretiens sur diverses matières de théologie\".\n\nIn 1685 he published \"Sentimens de quelques theologiens de Hollande sur l'histoire critique du Vieux Testament composée par le P. Richard Simon\", in which, while pointing out what he believed to be Richard Simon's faults, he advanced views of his own. These included: arguments against the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch; his views as to the manner in which the five books were composed; and his opinions on the subject of divine inspiration in general, in particular on the Book of Job, Book of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles. Simon's \"Réponse\" (1686) drew from Le Clerc a \"Defence des sentimens\" in the same year, which was followed by a new \"Réponse\" (1687).\n\nIn 1692 appeared his \"Logica sive Ars Ratiocinandi\", and also \"Ontologia et Pneumatologia\"; these, with the \"Physica sive de rebus corporeis\" (1696), are incorporated with the \"Opera Philosophica\", which have passed through several editions. In his \"Logica\", Le Clerc rewrites the Catholic Port-Royal \"Logique\" from a protestant Remonstrant perspective and supplements the \"Logique\" with analyses taken from \"Essay\" of his friend, John Locke.\nIn turn, Charles Gildon published a partial and unattributed translation of Le Clerc's \"Logica\" as the treatise \"Logic; or, The Art of Reasoning\" in the second (1712) and subsequent editions of John Brightland's \"Grammar of the English Tongue\".\nIn 1728, Ephraim Chambers used Gildon's translation of Le Clerc's version of the Port-Royal \"Logique\" as one of his sources when he compiled his \"Cyclopaedia\". John Mills and Gottfried Sellius later translated Chambers's \"Cyclopaedia\" into French. Their translation was appropriated by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert as the starting point for their Encyclopédie. \nIn particular, the article on définition (1754) in the \"Encyclopédie\" can be traced through this chain of writers, editors, translators, and compilers to the Port-Royal \"Logique\" through the \"Logica\" of Jean Le Clerc.\n\nIn 1693 his series of Biblical commentaries began with that on the Book of Genesis; the series was not completed until 1731. The portion relating to the New Testament books included the paraphrase and notes of Henry Hammond. Le Clerc's commentary challenged traditional views and argued the case for inquiry into the origin and meaning of the biblical books, It was hotly attacked on all sides.\n\nHis \"Ars Critica\" appeared in 1696, and, in continuation, \"Epistolae Criticae et Ecclesiasticae\" in 1700. Le Clerc produced a new edition of the Apostolic Fathers of Cotelerius (Jean-Baptiste Cotelier, 1627-1686), published in 1698. He also edited journals of book notices and reviews: the \"Bibliothèque universelle et historique\" (Amsterdam, 25 vols, 1686-1693), begun with J. C. de la Croze; the \"Bibliothèque choisie\" (Amsterdam, 28 vols, 1703-1713); and the \"Bibliothèque ancienne et moderne\", (29 vols, 1714-1726).\n\nOther works were Le Clerc's \"Parrhasiana ou, Pensées diverses sur des matiéres de critique, d'histoire, de morale et de politique avec la défense de divers ouvrages de M. L. C. par Théodore Parrhase\" (Amsterdam, 1699); and \"Vita et opera ad annum MDCCXI, amici ejus opusculum, philosophicis Clerici operibus subjiciendum\", also attributed to himself. The supplement to Hammond's notes was translated into English in 1699, \"Parrhasiana, or Thoughts on Several Subjects\", in 1700, the Harmony of the Gospels in 1701, and \"Twelve Dissertations\" out of 211. Other works include the collected works of Erasmus, begun in 1703, and \"Harmonia evangelica\", 1700. One of his final works was his three-volume \"Histoire des Provinces-Unies des Pays Bas\", covering the history of the Dutch Republic up to the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and published between 1723 and 1728.\n\n\n"}

Other notable recipients of the award include former German Federal Minister of Labor Norbert Blüm, former Secretary of State of France, Alain Vivien and Operation Clambake founder Andreas Heldal-Lund. Psychologist Margaret Singer was selected at the 2003 ceremony to be the 2004 Award recipient, but she died shortly thereafter and no award was given in that year.\n\nOriginally begun as the \"Alternative Charlemagne Award,\" the honor was formed as a counterpoint to the Charlemagne Award given to U.S. President Bill Clinton in 2000. Presented in Aachen, Germany, the Charlemagne Award, or Karlspreis, \"honors individuals who promote democracy, human rights and the common values of Europe.\" The original title of the Leipzig Human Rights Award was so-named as a way of criticizing the relationship between the Church of Scientology and the Clinton Administration, which granted Scientology tax exemption status during Clinton's term in office. The European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA was formed in 1997, and includes committee members from Germany, the United States, England, Austria, Russia and Sweden. The Committee opposes \"physical and psychological abuse of humans under the pretext of religion.\" The organization notes that their criticism of the United States for \"its failure to confront Scientology’s human rights abuses while promoting the cult around the world\" has made the Award controversial, and states that all past recipients of the Award have been targeted by the Church of Scientology as Suppressive persons, and subjected to the Church's Fair Game policy. Award recipients do not receive financial compensation as part of the award.\n\nThe organization's charter cites its concern over the deaths of Lisa McPherson and Patrice Vic, and states \"We wish to express our support for the American people and the American government in ending human rights violations against US citizens and other people, committed by the Scientology Organization.\" Specifically, the Leipzig Human Rights Award charter calls on the United States to reestablish \"true freedom of life, speech, religion, personality and pursuit of happiness,\" and emphasizes freedom of speech, freedom for members of an organization to leave that organization without fear of retribution, freedom from blackmail through materials obtained during spiritual counseling, and calls on the United States for full disclosure of \"secret agreements\" between the Internal Revenue Service and the Church of Scientology.\n\nBob Minton, at the time a prominent critic of Scientology, received the first award in 2000 as the Alternative Charlemagne Award. In her speech at the event, Scientology Task Force of the Hamburg Interior Authority Commissioner Ursula Caberta cited Minton's recognition of \"what dangers could arise for people and liberal democracy from Scientology.\" Minton had provided former members of Scientology with financial and legal assistance after they had left the organization. At the awards ceremony, Sect Commissioner of the Evangelical Church in Berlin-Brandenburg Thomas Gandow stated \"By holding this ceremony, we intended to give a sign that, in spite of the Clinton administration, there are people in America who think differently and who do not swim with the Scientology tide.\" Gandow cited Minton's actions as chairman of the Lisa McPherson Trust helping former members of Scientology make claims against the organization in court. The Church of Scientology was critical of Minton being honored, and formed its own organization opposed to the Leipzig Human Rights Award, and on May 29, 2000 sent letters to bishops of the Evangelical State Churches in Berlin-Brandenburg and Saxony. The letter stated that Sect Commissioner Thomas Gandow should be dismissed, and said that the Saxon state church should \"distance itself from the [Awards] procedure.\" In response, Gandow stated that Clinton had received the Charlemagne Award despite his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The awards ceremony took place at the old stock exchange in the Old City of Leipzig. The award given to Minton was presented as a sculpture of the St. Nicholas Church, Leipzig, and was created by Leipzig artist Ruediger Bartels. The award presentation was held on June 3, 2000, one day after the presentation of the official Charlemagne Award to President Bill Clinton by Aachen Mayor Jürgen Linden.\n\nFormer German Federal Minister of Labor Norbert Blüm was honored with the 2001 Leipzig Human Rights Award. Blüm was recognized because he had \"championed human rights and religious freedom in the discussion with the totalitarian Scientology Organization.\" The Award again contained a picture of Leipzig's St. Nicholas Church, and Blüm was presented with the Award at a ceremony in Leipzig at a site near the Leipzig Trade Fair on June 10, 2001. In an interview with the \"junge Welt\" on June 11, 2001, Blüm was asked why it takes courage to be a politician critical of the Scientology, and he cited actions the Church of Scientology had taken against him: \"Scientology acts on people's fears. For instance they threatened me by saying they would distribute their dossier on me to television. They've called me all kinds of names in their newspaper: the \"Rasputin\" of politics, for example.\" Blüm also stated in the interview that he did not support a ban on Scientology in Germany, but rather sought to foster the distribution of information about the organization. He also compared what he saw as totalitarian similarities between the ideologies of L. Ron Hubbard and Adolf Hitler, noting that he was not comparing the individuals themselves but rather their \"totalitarian systems.\" At the awards presentation, Thomas Gandow stated that Blüm was the only federal minister to date to criticize Scientology's \"new totalitarianism.\" Gandow noted that Blüm had been criticized by Scientologists in the press, and was sued in court for his actions critical of the organization. The Scientology Church Germany, Inc. characterized the Award as a \"cynical mockery of the most elementary basic rights and of the East German civil rights movement,\" and referred to the Awards Committee as \"a dubious clan of fanatical religious discriminators.\"\n\nThe European-American Citizens Committee for Human Rights and Religious Freedom in the USA recognized former Secretary of State of France, Alain Vivien, with the third Leipzig Human Rights Award, on May 11, 2002. The Award was again presented in Leipzig at St. Nicholas Church, and a congratulatory speech was given by Bavaria's Interior Minister, Guenther Beckstein. The Award was an image of the St. Nicholas Church, encased in glass. At the time, Vivien was the President of the Interministerial Mission for Monitoring and Combatting Cultic Deviances, a French government agency. The Committee gave Vivien recognition for his work against \"new totalitarian organizations\", and spoke positively of his motivations which included his \"aim to protect society\"; Vivien was singled out for his \"demonstration of public courage\" while undergoing what the Committee referred to as \"pressure from a new form of totalitarianism exercised by Scientology\". In his speech honoring Vivien, Minister Guenther Beckstein called Vivien a \"pioneer in the Scientology controversy across Europe and across the world.\" Beckstein stated that Vivien's work demonstrated that it is possible to prevent the misuse of the word \"religion\" by totalitarian organizations. In his acceptance speech, Vivien stated he was pleased \"to receive the award in a place from which freedom of thought has for so long emanated.\"\n\nOperation Clambake founder Andreas Heldal-Lund became the fourth recipient of the Leipzig Human Rights Award, on May 17, 2003. Operation Clambake was cited by the Committee for exposing what it referred to as \"fraud and human rights violations\" of the Church of Scientology in the United States. The European-American Citizens Committee said it echoed a statement Heldal-Lund had written at the Operation Clambake website, where he stated: \"People should be free to believe whatever they want, including Scientology,\" but also cited what he believed to be the organization's \"deceitfulness, its lack of compassion for its members (especially the hard-working staff), its aggressive hard sell, its arrogance, its attack on free speech, its litigiousness, its harassment of its critics, its lack of concern for families, its gross neglect and abuse of children.\" Heldal-Lund was recognized for \"maintaining his Web page despite repeated legal attacks from church officials.\" Church of Scientology officials had attempted to silence Heldal-Lund by requesting Google Inc. and Internet Archive remove links to Operation Clambake, claiming violation of their copyrights. The Awards ceremony again included the presentation of a glass-contained sculpture with an image of St. Nicholas Church. Alain Vivien presented Heldal-Lund with the Award, and stated that his work had revealed the actions of Scientologists with \"respect and intelligence.\" In his acceptance speech, Heldal-Lund spoke about freedom of speech, and emphasized the role of the individual citizen.\n\nAfter the 2003 Awards ceremony completed, the Committee met and selected Dr. Margaret Thaler Singer to receive the 2004 award. Singer died on November 23, 2003, and as a result no award was given out in 2004. The European-American Citizens Committee stated: \"The Committee really had no choice but to not select another award recipient for 2004, because Margaret truly is irreplaceable. We also decided not to hold a celebration this year.\"\n\n"}

It contains more than 450,000 works of art, making it one of the most comprehensive collections in the Americas. With more than one million visitors a year, it is the 60th most-visited art museum in the world .\n\nFounded in 1870, the museum moved to its current location in 1909. The museum is affiliated with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts was founded in 1870 and opened in 1876, with most of its initial collection taken from the Boston Athenæum Art Gallery. Francis Davis Millet, a local artist, was instrumental in starting the Art School affiliated with the museum, and in appointing Emil Otto Grundmann as its first director. The museum was originally located in a highly ornamented brick Gothic Revival building in Copley Square designed by John Hubbard Sturgis and Charles Brigham which was noted for its massed architectural terracotta in an American building. It was built almost entirely of brick and terracotta (imported from England), with some stone about its base.\n\nIn 1907, plans were laid to build a new home for the museum on Huntington Avenue in Boston's Fenway-Kenmore neighborhood, near the recently-constructed mansion that would later become the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum. Museum trustees decided to hire architect Guy Lowell to create a design for a museum that could be built in stages, as funding was obtained for each phase. Two years later, the first section of Lowell’s neoclassical design was completed. It featured a façade of granite and a grand rotunda. The museum moved to its new location later that year; the Copley Plaza Hotel eventually replaced the old building.\n\nThe second phase of construction built a wing along The Fens to house paintings galleries. It was funded entirely by Maria Antoinette Evans Hunt, the wife of wealthy business magnate Robert Dawson Evans, and opened in 1915. From 1916 through 1925, the noted artist John Singer Sargent painted the frescoes that adorn the rotunda and the associated colonnades. \n\nNumerous additions enlarged the building throughout the years, including the Decorative Arts wing in 1928 (again enlarged in 1968) and the Norma Jean Calderwood Garden Court and Terrace in 1997. The West Wing, designed by I. M. Pei, opened in 1981, and was renamed the Linde Family Wing for Contemporary Art in 2008. This wing now houses the museum's cafe, restaurant, meeting rooms, classrooms, and a giftshop/bookstore, as well as large exhibition spaces.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, the museum launched a major effort to renovate and expand its facilities. In a seven-year fundraising campaign between 2001 and 2008 for a new wing, the endowment, and operating expenses, the museum managed to total over $500 million, in addition to acquiring over $160 million worth of art. During the global financial crisis between 2007 and 2012, the museum's budget was trimmed by $1.5 million and the museum increased revenues by conducting traveling exhibitions, which included a loan exhibition sent to the for-profit Bellagio in Las Vegas in exchange for $1 million. In 2011, Moody's Investors Service calculated that the museum had over $180 million in outstanding debt. However, the agency cited growing attendance, a large endowment, and positive cash flow as reasons to believe that the museum's finances would become stable in the near future.\n\nIn 2011, the museum put eight paintings by Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Gauguin, and others on sale at Sotheby's, bringing in a total of $21.6 million, to pay for \"Man at His Bath\" by Gustave Caillebotte at a cost reported to be more than $15 million.\n\nThe renovation included a new Art of the Americas Wing to feature artwork from North, South, and Central America. In 2006, the groundbreaking ceremonies took place. The wing and adjoining Ruth and Carl J. Shapiro Family Courtyard were designed in a restrained, contemporary style by the London-based architectural firm Foster and Partners, under the directorship of Thomas T. Difraia and CBT/Childs Bertman Tseckares Architects. The landscape architecture firm Gustafson Guthrie Nichol redesigned the Huntington Avenue and Fenway entrances, gardens, access roads, and interior courtyards.\n\nThe wing opened on November 20, 2010 with free admission to the public. Mayor Thomas Menino declared it \"Museum of Fine Arts Day\", and more than 13,500 visitors attended the opening. The glass-enclosed courtyard features a high glass sculpture, titled the \"Lime Green Icicle Tower\", by Dale Chihuly. In 2014, the Art of the Americas Wing was recognized for its high architectural achievement by being awarded the Harleston Parker Medal, by the Boston Society of Architects.\n\nIn 2015, the museum renovated its Japanese garden, Tenshin-en. The garden, which originally opened in 1988, was designed by Japanese professor Kinsaku Nakane. The garden's \"kabukimon\"-style entrance gate was built by Chris Hall of Massachusetts, using traditional Japanese carpentry techniques.\n\nThe Museum of Fine Arts possesses materials from a wide variety of art movements and cultures. The museum also maintains a large online database with information on over 346,000 items from its collection, accompanied with digitized images.\n\nSome highlights of the collection include:\n\nThe libraries at the Museum of Fine Arts house 320,000 items. The main branch, the William Morris Hunt Memorial Library, named after the noted American artist, is located off-site in Horticultural Hall.\n\nOther notable works are in the collection, but the following examples are ones in the public domain and for which pictures are available.\n\n\n\nA bulletin has appeared under various titles from 1903 to 1983:\n\n\n\n"}

Unlike an uncorrected aerial photograph, an orthophotograph can be used to measure true distances, because it is an accurate representation of the Earth's surface, having been adjusted for topographic relief, lens distortion, and camera tilt.\n\nOrthophotographs are commonly used in geographic information systems (GIS) as a \"map accurate\" background image. An orthorectified image differs from \"rubber sheeted\" rectifications as the latter may accurately locate a number of points on each image but \"stretch\" the area between so scale may not be uniform across the image. A digital elevation model (DEM) is required to create an accurate orthophoto as distortions in the image due to the varying distance between the camera/sensor and different points on the ground need to be corrected. An orthoimage and a \"rubber sheeted\" image can both be said to have been \"georeferenced\" however the overall accuracy of the rectification varies. Software can display the orthophoto and allow an operator to digitize or place linework, text annotations or geographic symbols (such as hospitals, schools, and fire stations). Some software can process the orthophoto and produce the linework automatically.\n\nProduction of orthophotos was historically achieved using mechanical devices.\n\nAn orthophotomosaic is a raster image made by merging orthophotos — aerial or satellite photographs which have been transformed to correct for perspective so that they appear to have been taken from vertically above at an infinite distance. Google Earth images are of this type.\n\nThe document (digital or paper) representing an orthophotomosaic with additional marginal information like a title, north arrow, scale bar and cartographical information is called an orthophotomap or image map. Often these maps show additional point, line or polygon layers (like a traditional map) on top of the orthophotomosaic. A similar document, mostly used for disaster relief, is called a spatiomap.\n\n\n\n"}

The main text of published authors (e.g. the story, non-fiction description, poems, etc.) is often surrounded by other material supplied by the authors, editors, printers, and publishers, which is known as the paratext. These added elements form a frame for the main text, and can change the reception of a text or its interpretation by the public. Paratext is most often associated with books, as they typically include a cover (with associated cover art), title, front matter (dedication, opening information, foreword), back matter (endpapers, colophon) footnotes, and many other materials not crafted by the author. Other editorial decisions can also fall into the category of paratext, such as the formatting or typography. Because of their close association with the text, it may seem that authors should be given the final say about paratextual materials, but often that is not the case. One example of controversy surrounding paratext is the case of the 2009 young adult novel \"Liar\", which was initially published with an image of a white girl on the cover, although the narrator of the story was identified in the text as black.\n\nThe concept of paratext is closely related to the concept of hypotext, which is the earlier text that serves as a source for the current text.\n\nLiterary theorist Gérard Genette defines paratext as those things in a published work that accompany the text, things such as the author's name, the title, preface or introduction, or illustrations.\nGenette states \"More than a boundary or a sealed border, the paratext is, rather, a threshold.\" It is \"a zone between text and off-text, a zone not only of transition but also of transaction: a privileged place of pragmatics and a strategy, of an influence on the public, an influence that ... is at the service of a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it\". Then quoting Philippe Lejeune, Genette further describes paratext as \"a fringe of the printed text which in reality controls one's whole reading of the text\". This threshold consists of a peritext, consisting of elements such as titles, chapter titles, prefaces and notes. It also includes an epitext, which consists of elements such as interviews, publicity announcements, reviews by and addresses to critics, private letters and other authorial and editorial discussions – 'outside' of the text in question. The paratext is the sum of the peritext and epitext.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36983600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36983600", "title": "Perfectionist liberalism", "text": "Perfectionist liberalism\n\nPerfectionist liberalism has been defined by Charles Larmore (1987) as the \"family of views that base political principles on 'ideals claiming to shape our overall conception of the good life, and not just our role as citizens.'\" Joseph Raz popularised those ideas. Other important contemporary theorists of liberal perfectionism are George Sher and Steven Wall. One can also find liberal perfectionist strands of thought in the writings of early liberals like John Stuart Mill and T.H.Green.\n\nPerfectionist liberalism (or liberal perfectionism - most, though not all authors use these terms synonymously) is the combination of two ideas: Perfectionism and Liberalism. What makes perfectionist liberalism perfectionist is its embracement of an objective theory of the good life (or of human well-being) and the belief that it is the business of the state to (sometimes) promote the good life of its citizens or (if a cosmopolitanist theory of justice is correct) to promote the good life of all human beings. What makes perfectionist liberalism liberal is that it either holds a theory of the good life that gives pride of place to the value of autonomy or that it holds a theory of the good life from which classical liberal rights and/or the principle of state neutrality can be derived (contingently, yet over a wide range of \"close\" possible worlds), or both.\n\nOften perfectionism is associated with paternalism. If the state is to promote the well-being of its citizens, so the reasoning, it also has to intervene with citizen's actions that are not conducive to their well-being. Most perfectionist liberals try to avoid this implication by showing that paternalist state action is self-defeating, i.e. they try to show that the best way for the state to promote the well-being of its citizens is to restraint itself and let each individual to strive for her good by herself. Others bite the bullet and hold that liberalism is compatible with some amount of paternalism.\n\nAmong political philosophers it is commonplace that perfectionist liberals derive political principles (that guide political action and the design of political institutions) from a theory of the good life. What is often missed is that a theory of political action is not derivable from a theory of the good life alone. Principles can only be derived from other principles. It is therefore of critical importance that liberal perfectionists commit themselves not only to a theory of the good life but also to a theory of distributive justice. Utilitarianism, Egalitarianism, Sufficientarianism and Prioritarianism are the standard candidates when it comes to principles of distribution.\nFor Raz, at the centre of his perfectionist liberalism are \"autonomy\" and \"moral pluralism\" and the approach can be contrasted with \"political liberalism\". Martha Nussbaum (2011) notes that elsewhere Larmore (1997) argues that \"these views involve controversial ideals of the good life, or views about 'the ultimate nature of the human good.'\"\n\nFor Nussbaum, \"perfectionist liberalism\" \"is a species of a genus of liberal views that might be called “comprehensive liberalisms”\" as opposed to \"political\" or \"public\" liberalisms. All perfectionist liberalisms are therefore comprehensive while not all comprehensive liberalisms are perfectionist. An eminent case of a comprehensive, yet non-perfectionist liberal theory is Lockean libertarianism, which is build on the ideal of self-ownership rather than on a conception of the good life. For Nussbaum \"liberalisms that base political principles on some comprehensive doctrine about human life\" cover \"not only the political domain but also the domain of human conduct generally.\". Furthermore, they depart from non-comprehensive (i.e. political or public reason) liberalism in grounding their political principles in a theory of the good (life), while the latter takes an allegedly \"neutral\" stance which is supposed to be compatible with all kinds of (reasonable) theories of the good (life). \n"}

{"id": "38707853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38707853", "title": "Political consciousness", "text": "Political consciousness\n\nFollowing the work of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Karl Marx outlined the workings of a political consciousness.\n\nConsciousness typically refers to the idea of a being who is self-aware. It is a distinction often reserved for human beings. This remains the original and most common usage of the term. For Marx, consciousness describes a person's political sense of self. That is, consciousness describes a person's awareness of politics. For Marx, an authentic consciousness was linked to understanding one's true position in History. While Hegel placed God behind the workings of consciousness in people, Marx saw the political economy as the engine of mind.\n\nIn the 20th century, many social movements and intellectuals have developed this use of consciousness.\n\nIn Marx's view, consciousness was always political, for it was always the outcome of politic-economic circumstances. What one thinks of life, power, and self, for Marx, is always a product of ideological forces.\n\nFor Marx, ideologies appear to explain and justify the current distribution of wealth and power in a society. In societies with unequal allocations of wealth and power, ideologies present these inequalities as acceptable, virtuous, inevitable, and so forth. Ideologies thus tend to lead people to accept the status quo. The subordinate people come to believe in their subordination: the peasants to accept the rule of the aristocracy, the factory workers to accept the rule of the owners, consumers the rule of corporations. This belief in one's own subordination, which comes about through ideology, is, for Marx, false consciousness.\n\nThat is, conditions of inequality create ideologies which confuse people about their true aspirations, loyalties, and purposes. Thus, for example, the working class has often been, for Marx, beguiled by nationalism, organized religion, and other distractions. These ideological devices help to keep people from realizing that it is they who produce wealth, they who deserve the fruits of the land, all who can prosper: instead of literally thinking for themselves, they think the thoughts given to them by the ruling class.\n\nFor Marx, consciousness is a reflection of the political economy. A person's thoughts tend to be shaped by his or her political and economic circumstances. He famously wrote, \"It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness.\"\nPerhaps Marx's greatest contribution to modern thought... is his comprehensive investigation into the role of Ideology, or how social being determines consciousness, which results in certain (for the most part unconscious) belief and value systems depending on the particular economic infrastructure pertaining at the time. From a Marxian point of view all cultural artifacts--religious systems, philosophical positions, ethical values--are, naturally enough, products of consciousness and as such are subject to these ideological pressures. \n\nMany social movements have loosely followed Marx's thinking on consciousness. Attaining consciousness, many believe, means finding one's \"true\" historical path, as opposed to the propaganda dispensed by the ruling elites. Thus, the feminist movement spoke of consciousness raising and many South African activists have subscribe to a Black Consciousness Movement, which calls upon Blacks to pursue their \"true\" political trajectory (as opposed to the ideas set out by, for example, the apartheid regime). In the latter example, for many South African Blacks, consciousness meant rejecting racist ideas about Blacks, rejecting White rule of the nation, and restoring Black identity, history, and power.\n\nIn a politically charged sense, becoming \"politically conscious\" is often meant to connote that people have awakened to their \"true\" political role, their \"actual\" identity. For Marx, this meant that the working classes would become conscious of themselves as the agents of history--they would unite and share in the wealth of labor. This, for Marx, was their historical role and their right (as opposed to working for wages, fighting wars on behalf of capitalists, and so forth). For many African Americans, \"consciousness\" has meant identifying and discrediting forms of White supremacy, including those internalized by Blacks. In these uses of the term \"consciousness\" is truth or destiny. These uses of political consciousness are often politically charged. Does, for example, a Black woman lack consciousness because she generally supports a system run mostly by White male capitalists? If she became politically conscious would she think differently? What is her \"true\" consciousness supposed to look like?\n\nMany marxists, feminists, African Americans (and other groups), have ceased to argue that there is one true form of consciousness. Instead, while preserving a sense that the ruling class perpetuates a dominant ideology and often behaves in ways which harm people, many dissenters now hold a more liberal position which tolerates a variety of political positions. The complexities of political consciousness are described by the theories of cultural hegemony.\n\n\n\n"}

Since the meaning of texts and signs depend on their context, recontextualisation implies a change of meaning, and often of the communicative purpose too. The linguist Per Linell defines recontextualisation as:\n\"the dynamic transfer-and-transformation of something from one discourse/text-in-context ... to another.\"\nLinell distinguishes between recontextualisation at three different levels:\nThough recontextualisation often is used within linguistics, it also has interdisciplinary applications. Particularly, in Basil Bernstein's concept of the pedagogic device that consists of three fields: the fields of production, recontextualisation and reproduction. The field of reproduction is the field of schooling institutions. The field of production is the field, where knowledge is produced (often universities). The field of recontextualisation mediates between these two fields. The recontextualisation field \"is composed of two sub-fields; namely, the official recontextualising field (ORF) and the pedagogic recontextualising field (PRF). The ORF consists of 'specialized departments and sub-agencies of the State and local educational authorities'. The PRF consists of university departments of education, their research as well as specialised educational media.\n\nRhetorical scholar John Oddo argues that recontextualization has a future-oriented counterpoint, which he dubs \"precontextualization\".

He taught English and comparative literature for many years at Princeton University.\n\nFagles was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Charles Fagles, a lawyer, and Vera Voynow Fagles, an architect. He attended Amherst College, graduating in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. The following year, he received his master's degree from Yale University. On June 17, 1956, he married Marilyn (Lynne) Duchovnay, a teacher, and they had two children. In 1959, Fagles received his Ph.D in English from Yale and for the next year taught English there.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1962, Fagles was an English instructor at Princeton University. In 1962 he was promoted to Assistant Professor, and in 1965 became an Associate Professor of English and comparative literature. Later that year he became director of the comparative literature program. In 1970, he became a full professor, and from 1975 was the department chair. He retired from teaching as the Arthur W. Marks '19 Professor of Comparative Literature in 2002, and remained a professor emeritus at Princeton.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1996, Fagles translated many ancient Greek works. His first translation was of the poetry of Bacchylides, publishing a complete set in 1961. In the 1970s, Fagles began translating much Greek drama, beginning with Aeschylus's \"The Oresteia\". He went on to publish translations of Sophocles's three Theban plays (1982), Homer's \"Iliad\" (1990) and \"Odyssey\" (1996), and Virgil's \"Aeneid\" (2006). In these last four, Bernard Knox authored the introduction and notes. Fagles' translations generally emphasize contemporary English phrasing and idiom but are faithful to the original as much as possible.\n\nIn 1978, Fagles published \"I, Vincent: Poems from the Pictures of Van Gogh\". He was the co-editor of \"Homer: A Collection of Critical Essays\" (1962) and \"Pope's Iliad and Odyssey\" (1967).\n\nFagles died at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, on March 26, 2008, from prostate cancer.\n\nFagles was nominated for the National Book Award in Translation and won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award of the Academy of American Poets in 1991 for his translation of the \"Iliad\". In 1996, he received an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters for his translation of the \"Odyssey\". In 1997 he received the PEN/Ralph Manheim Medal for lifetime achievement in translation. Fagles later undertook a new English translation of the \"Aeneid\", which was published in November 2006.\n\nIn addition to the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Fagles was also a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.\n\nHe received a National Humanities Medal by the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n\nOn June 8, 2011, a resource center devoted to the study of the Classics was dedicated to Dr. Fagles at Princeton High School. At the dedication, students and teachers paid tribute to Dr. Fagles.\n\n\n"}

Edsel\n\nRobert Morse Edsel (born December 28, 1956) is an American businessman and author. He has written three non-fiction books - \"Rescuing Da Vinci\" (2006), \"Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History\" (2007); and \"Saving Italy\" (2013) - chronicling the recovery of artwork stolen by Nazi Germany during World War II. A film based on his book, \"The Monuments Men,\" directed by and starring Academy Award winner George Clooney, was released in February 2014.\n\nEdsel is the co-producer of the Emmy-nominated documentary film, \"The Rape of Europa\" (2007). He is also founder and Chairman of the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art, which received the 2007 National Humanities Medal under President George W. Bush. The foundation has donated four albums of photographic evidence of the Third Reich's theft of art treasures to the United States National Archives.\n\nRobert M. Edsel was born in 1956, in Oak Park, Illinois, and raised in Dallas, Texas. He is the son of Norma Louise (née Morse), a housewife, and Alpha Ray Edsel, a stockbroker. Edsel was formerly a nationally ranked tennis player.\n\nIn 1981, he began his business career in oil and gas exploration. His company, Gemini Exploration, pioneered the use of horizontal drilling technology throughout the early 1990s. Gemini Exploration grew from a company of eight employees to almost 100. By 1995, Gemini had become the second most active driller of horizontal wells in the United States. Edsel sold the company’s assets to Union Pacific Resources Company, and the following year, he moved to Europe with his family.\n\nIn the late 1990s, while living in Florence, Edsel began to think about the methods and planning used to keep art out of the hands of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. Following a divorce in 2000, Edsel moved to New York City, where he began a serious effort to learn about and understand the issue.\n\nBy 2004, those efforts had become a full-time career, and he established a research office in Dallas, his hometown. By 2005, he had gathered thousands of photographs and other documents, and began writing the manuscript for \"Rescuing Da Vinci\", which was published in 2006. The book received wide attention.\n\nIn September 2009, Edsel’s second book, \"\", a narrative account of the Monuments Men, was published by Center Street, a division of Hachette Book Group. The book has been translated and published in more than 25 languages. George Clooney wrote, directed and starred in a movie of the same name based on Edsel's book, \"The Monuments Men\" (2014).\n\nEdsel's third book, entitled \"\" (2013), was published by W. W. Norton and debuted on the \"New York Times\" bestseller list. \"Saving Italy\" tells the dramatic story of the Monuments Men's efforts to locate and recover that country’s innumerable art treasures that had been stolen by the Nazis. Beginning with the near destruction of Leonardo Da Vinci’s \"The Last Supper\" by British bombing, Edsel introduces a major but largely overlooked Nazi figure, SS General Karl Wolff. Edsel describes Wolff's harrowing negotiations with OSS leader Allen Dulles, America’s senior spy in Europe, related to the artworks and preserving Paris after the Nazis' retreat.\n\nEdsel co-produced a documentary film, \"The Rape of Europa\" (2007), based on Lynn Nicholas' eponymous book. Narrated by Joan Allen, the film was well received by critics and began a theatrical run in September 2007 at the Paris Theatre in New York City. In addition, Edsel has created \"The Greatest Theft in History\" educational program, which includes the two-hour documentary film and seven hours of additional clips, as well as a companion website featuring lesson plans, glossaries, timelines, and other resources to enable teachers to easily use this material in the classroom.\n\nIn 2007, Edsel created the Monuments Men Foundation for the Preservation of Art. The foundation's mission is \"to preserve the legacy of the unprecedented and heroic work of the men and women who served in the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (“MFAA”) section, known as “Monuments Men,” during World War II, by raising public awareness of the importance of protecting and safeguarding civilization’s most important artistic and cultural treasures from armed conflict, but incorporating these expressions of man's greatest creative achievements into our daily lives.\" He announced the foundation's creation during a ceremony on June 6, 2007, the 63rd anniversary of D-Day, to celebrate Senate and House concurrent resolutions honoring the Monuments Men.\n\nThe Monuments Men Foundation was one of ten recipients of the 2007 National Humanities Medal, an honor which was presented by President Bush during a ceremony held in the East Room of The White House on November 15, 2007. The National Humanities Medal is the highest honor given for excellence in the Humanities field.\n\nDuring the course of their research into the whereabouts of lost art, Edsel and the staff of the Monuments Men Foundation discovered four large, leather-bound photograph albums which documented portions of the European art looted by the Nazis. The albums were in the possession of heirs to an American soldier stationed in the Berchtesgaden area of Germany, in the closing days of World War II.\n\nThe albums were created by the staff of the Third Reich’s \"Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg\" (ERR), a special unit that found and confiscated the best material in Nazi-occupied countries, to use for exploitation. In France, the ERR engaged in an extensive and elaborate art looting operation, part of Hitler’s much larger premeditated scheme to steal art treasures from conquered nations. The albums were created for Hitler and high-level Nazi officials as a catalogue and, more importantly, to give Hitler a way to choose the art for his art museum in Austria. A group of these photograph albums was presented to Hitler on his birthday in 1943, to \"send a ray of beauty and joy into [his] revered life.\" ERR staff stated that nearly 100 such volumes were created during the years of their art looting operation.\n\nIn November 2007, at a ceremony with Archivist of the United States Allen Weinstein, Edsel announced the discovery of the first two photograph albums and, separately, donated the albums to the National Archives. Weinstein called the discovery \"one of the most significant finds related to Hitler’s premeditated theft of art and other cultural treasures to be found since the Nuremberg trials.\"\n\nIn 2014, Edsel received the Records of Achievement award from the Foundation for the National Archives, for \"'bringing to life the storied history of the men and women' who served in the Monuments Men...\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "216810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216810", "title": "Spitting Image", "text": "Spitting Image\n\nSpitting Image was a British satirical television puppet show, created by Peter Fluck, Roger Law and Martin Lambie-Nairn. The series was produced by 'Spitting Image Productions' for Central Independent Television over 18 series which aired on the ITV network. The series was nominated and won numerous awards during its run including ten BAFTA Television Awards, one for editing in 1989 and two Emmy Awards in 1985 and 1986 in the Popular Arts Category.\n\nThe series featured puppet caricatures of celebrities prominent during the 1980s and 1990s, including British Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major and other politicians, US president Ronald Reagan, and the British Royal Family; the series was the first to caricature Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (as an elderly gin-drinker with a Beryl Reid voice).\n\nOne of the most-watched shows of the 1980s and early 1990s, the series was a satire of politics, entertainment, sport and British culture of the era, and at its peak it was watched by 15 million people. The series was cancelled in 1996, after viewing figures declined. ITV had plans for a new series in 2006, but these were scrapped after a dispute over Ant & Dec puppets used to host \"Best Ever Spitting Image\", which were created against Roger Law's wishes. In 2018, Law donated his entire archive – including original scripts, puppet moulds, drawings and recordings – to Cambridge University.\n\nMartin Lambie-Nairn proposed a satirical television show featuring caricature puppets created by Peter Fluck and Roger Law. Fluck and Law, who had both attended the Cambridge School of Art, had no previous television experience, but had, for several years, constructed plasticine caricatures in order to illustrate articles in \"The Sunday Times\" Magazine.\n\nThe idea for the series was rejected by many in the industry, who thought it would only be suitable for children, but the series was finally accepted for development and first broadcast in 1984.\n\nEnglish comedy writer and \"National Lampoon\" editor Tony Hendra, was brought in as a writer; Fluck and Law had met him while they were working in the US. Hendra brought in John Lloyd, producer of \"Not The Nine O'Clock News\". They were joined by Jon Blair, a documentary producer. They then hired Muppet puppeteer Louise Gold. Development was funded by Clive Sinclair.\n\nThe puppets, based on public figures, were designed by Fluck and Law, assisted by caricaturists that included David Stoten, Pablo Bach, Steve Bendelack and Tim Watts. The episodes included musical parodies by Philip Pope (former member of \"Who Dares Wins\" and The Hee Bee Gee Bees) and later Steve Brown.\n\nThe first episode of \"Spitting Image\", in 1984, aired with a laugh track, apparently at the insistence of Central Television. This episode was shown to a preview audience before transmission.\n\nIn the early years of the show, \"Spitting Image\" was filmed and based in the enterprise zone at London Docklands at the Limehouse Studios, where scriptwriters convened and puppets were manufactured. Impressionist Steve Nallon recalls that \"they were able to get away with no health and safety, so all of the building of the puppets with all the toxic waste from the foam was just in a warehouse. There were no extractor fans; it was quite Dickensian.\"\n\nIn later series, \"Spitting Image\" was recorded at Central's studios in Nottingham with last minute additions being recorded at the Limehouse Studios at Canary Wharf, London.\n\nBefore the first episode was broadcast, the parodies of the Royal Family were cut, as a courtesy to the Duke of Edinburgh, who opened the East Midlands television centre a few days later. The scenes were however all reinstated in later episodes.\n\nThe first episode had an audience of 7.9 million, but numbers rapidly dropped, which meant economies had to be introduced since the series cost £2.6 million, which was nearly double the price of other prime time series.\n\nThe series had been scheduled to have 13 episodes but was cut back to 12, after the series was nearly cancelled. Rob Grant and Doug Naylor were then brought in as head writers to save the show.\n\nBy 1986, under their supervision, \"Spitting Image\" had become popular, producing a number one song on the UK Singles Chart (\"The Chicken Song\"). However, Grant and Naylor subsequently left to create \"Red Dwarf\" for BBC2. \"Spitting Image\" had a short-running dispute with the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) in 1985, over the use of subliminal images.\n\nWhen Margaret Thatcher resigned as both Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party in November 1990, her successor was Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major. This marked a shift in the show's style, with the writers moving from the Punch and Judy style to more subtle and atmospheric sketches, notably a series in which an awkward Major and wife Norma ate peas for dinner. The producers dressed Major, skin and all, in shades of grey, and invented an affair between him and Virginia Bottomley.\n\nThe show added animated sketches from 1989 and again from 1994 (with short, animated segments before 1989). For the 1992 Election Special, a studio audience was used; this format was revisited for two episodes in late 1993. A spoof \"Question Time\" took questions from the audience. The 1992 show was fronted by a puppet Robin Day, a puppet Jeremy Paxman filling the role in the episodes broadcast on 14 November 1993 and 12 December 1993.\n\nThe writers, Mark Burton, John O'Farrell, Pete Sinclair, Stuart Silver, and Ray Harris quit the show in 1993 and in 1995, and with viewing figures in decline, production was cancelled. The final series was in January and February 1996, with the final episode featuring \"The Last Prophecies of Spitting Image\" in which Labour moved into Number 10.\n\nA few years later, most of the puppets were sold at an auction hosted by Sotheby's, including a puppet of Osama Bin Laden never used in the series.\n\nDuring 2004, the idea of the series coming back started to appear after John Lloyd held talks with ITV executives about the show's return. John Lloyd also held talks with a number of people who voiced the \"Spitting Image\" puppets, including John Sessions, Harry Enfield and Rory Bremner, with all responding positively.\n\nMr Lloyd commented, \"There's enormous enthusiasm from ITV to do it. We're just trying to work out how it would be affordable. The budget is about to go off to ITV,\" he said. \"Everybody seems to have residual affection for Spitting Image. It could be scrappy and uneven, but it's rather like a newspaper. You don't expect it to be brilliant every time, but there's something delicious in every edition,\" Mr Lloyd said.\n\nBy early 2006, ITV were producing a documentary celebrating the series and if the audience figures were good a full series might have been produced. On 25 June 2006, ITV transmitted \"Best Ever Spitting Image\" as a one-off special of \"Spitting Image\" which took a nostalgic look back at the programme's highlights. This special actually prevented ITV directly resurrecting the famous satire as they had planned, because it featured new puppets of Ant and Dec – a move which was against the wishes of Roger Law, who owns the rights to the \"Spitting Image\" brand.\n\n\"Spitting Image\", as ITV's primary satirical programme, was succeeded by \"2DTV\", a cartoon format that had five series between 2001 and 2004. In 2008 ITV created a CGI version to caricature and lampoon the famous, called \"Headcases\", but it only aired for one series. Satirical puppets finally returned to ITV in 2015, in \"Newzoids\".\n\nIn April 2017, it was reported that US broadcaster HBO was set to revive the series in light of the presidency of Donald Trump. As of the report, no official confirmation or announcement was made.\n\nIn 2018, \"Spitting Image\" co-creator Roger Law donated his entire archive – which includes original scripts, puppet moulds, drawings and recordings – to Cambridge University. The collection is located in the university library, with its librarian Dr Jessica Gardner describing the collection as a \"national treasure\". She added, \"Spitting Image was anarchic, it was creative, it entered the public imagination like nothing else from that era. It is an extraordinary political and historical record. Great satire holds up a mirror, it questions and challenges.\"\n\nAll episodes and specials were broadcast on Sunday, usually at 10pm. The programme was also picked up overseas. It aired on Canada's CBC Television on Sunday nights in the late 1980s. The American network NBC aired several prime-time specials in the same period. Austrian public broadcaster ORF broadcast \"Spitting Image\" in English with German subtitles late on Friday nights in approximately four-week intervals in the late 1980s and early 1990s, introducing it to the German-speaking world (where foreign programming is usually dubbed into German). \"Spitting Image\" was also briefly shown in France on the private TV channel M6 in English with French subtitles. The show was also aired in New Zealand on TVNZ in the 1980s.\n\nFrom October 1996 to September 1998, \"Spitting Image\" Series 1-11 were on UK Gold, until September 1998. Edited episodes from Series 1-3 and 7 were on Granada Plus from 2001-2003.\n\nIn February 2008, Comedy Central Extra started showing regular repeats of \"Spitting Image\" from 9pm on Tuesday evenings, with a whole weekend's worth of evenings devoted to the first two series. It reappeared in a late night slot in November 2010, through to 18 December 2010 and has not been aired since then. From 2001 to 2004 the ITV series \"2DTV\" had a similar style, but using computer animation instead of puppets.\n\nThe programme is rebroadcast on the digital network \"PuppeTV\" as a part of its \"Puppets After Dark\" post - watershed slot. In 2011, the network dedicated an entire month to broadcasting all episodes of the show, from 10:00pm until 6:00am, including the 2006 clipshow special and the American specials, which they called \"Spitting Image 24/7\". \n\nIn an attempt to crack the American market, there were some attempts to produce a US version of the show. A 45-minute 'made for market' show by the original \"Spitting Image\" team, titled \"Spitting Image: Down and Out in the White House\" was produced in 1986 by Central for the NBC network.\n\nIntroduced by David Frost, it departed from the sketch-based format in favour of an overall storyline involving the upcoming (at that time) Presidential election. The plot involved a conspiracy to replace Ronald Reagan with a double (actually actor Dustin Hoffman in disguise). This plan was hatched by the Famous Corporation, a cabal of the ultra-rich headed by Johnny Carson's foil Ed McMahon (in the show, Carson was his ineffectual left-hand man) who met in a secret cavern hollowed out behind the façade of Mount Rushmore. Eventually, their plot foiled, the famous corporation activated their escape pod – Abraham Lincoln's nose – and left Earth for another planet, but (in a homage to the beginning of the \"Star Wars\" movies) were destroyed during a collision with 'a nonsensical prologue in gigantic lettering'.\n\nThe show was not very successful with its target audience, possibly because its humour was still very British and it was so irreverent about Ronald Reagan at a time when he was enormously popular with the American public. It did, however, receive great praise from critics and it was followed by several more television specials: \"The Ronnie & Nancy Show\" (also satirising the Reagans), \"The 1987 Movie Awards\" (sending up the Academy Awards), \"Bumbledown: The Life and Times of Ronald Reagan\" (a quasi-documentary about the President), and \"The Sound of Maggie\" (satirising Thatcher and parodying several musicals such as \"Oliver!\", \"West Side Story\" and many others).\n\nMany British politicians in parliament during Margaret Thatcher's tenure were parodied. By far the most prominent was Thatcher herself, portrayed as an abusive tyrant and cross-dresser (she wore suits, shaved, used the urinals, was portrayed as a cigar-chomper and addressed by her Cabinet as \"Sir\"). The Thatcher puppet had a strong dislike of anything French (agreeing with Hitler about 'teaching those Frenchies where to go' and throwing an apple out of the window because it was French).\n\nIn the first series, Thatcher sought advice from her enraptured neighbour Herr Jeremy Von Wilcox (who is actually an elderly Adolf Hitler, living at 9 Downing Street) about the unions and the unemployed. Mr. Wilcox/Hitler compares the Trade unions with the Soviet Union and advises not to attack in winter. Regarding unemployment, he says that people out of work should be put in the army, and tells Thatcher that he thinks the SS (meaning SAS) are a \"great bunch of guys\".\n\nAlongside Thatcher were her Cabinet, which included:\n\n\nThatcher's Cabinet were often depicted as bickering schoolchildren, with Thatcher acting as teacher.\n\nThatcher's successor John Major was portrayed as a dull, boring grey character who enjoyed a meal of peas with his wife Norma and was constantly mocked by Humphrey, the Downing Street cat. Before Thatcher's resignation, Major had been portrayed as wearing a leopard print suit and swinging in on a trapeze, referencing his background as the son of a circus acrobat (which he would frequently remind everyone about). Upon his appointment to Prime Minister, Major was initially portrayed as robotic with a spinning antenna on his head (it was explained in a sketch that Thatcher used it to control Major, standing behind Thatcher in the crowd of sycophantic cabinet members, eager to repeat whatever the Thatcher puppet screeched).\n\nThe Opposition (Labour Party) politicians included:\n\n\nArthur Scargill, who was a member of the Labour Party until 1997, appeared as head of the National Union of Mineworkers, and was portrayed as a big-nosed egotist who was ignorant about mining.\n\nIn 1994, a puppet of Tony Blair made his appearance. He was originally a public school boy, wearing grey shorts, blazer and cap. His catchphrase was \"I'M THE LEADER\" in reference to his attempt to lead the Labour Party. When Blair did become Labour leader, the puppet changed and he was portrayed with his grin replaced with an even bigger smile if he said something of importance. The deputy leader, John Prescott, was portrayed as a fat bumbling assistant, along with a squeaky voiced Robin Cook, and an enormous glasses-wearing Jack Straw.\n\nThe SDP-Liberal Alliance was portrayed by the election-losing, populist, arrogant and undecided David Owen, with whining, bedwetting David Steel in his pocket. They were soon replaced by Paddy Ashdown, whose \"equidistance\" from the larger parties was satirised by his frequent appearance at the side of the screen during unrelated sketches, saying: \"I am neither in this sketch nor not in it, but somewhere in-between\". This running gag was used when Ashdown's extramarital affair was revealed, and his puppet commented that \"I didn't touch her on the left leg, or the right leg, but somewhere in-between.\" Former liberal MP Cyril Smith also made a few appearances depicted as morbidly obese.\n\nFormer Prime Ministers Harold Wilson, James Callaghan, Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home were depicted as living in a highly restrictive retirement home named Exchequers, where they were frequently abused by Queen Victoria. Wilson constantly attempted escape, whilst Callaghan took delight in tormenting him. Edward Heath was also said to have resided there, but he was not seen on screen.\n\nThe main characters were:\n\nOther members who were parodied include: Prince Andrew, Duke of York, The Duchess of York, The Princess Royal, Prince Edward, Princess Michael of Kent and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, who was always tipsy.\n\nSpitting Image lampooned US President Ronald Reagan as a bumbling, nuke-obsessed fool in comparison with his advisors Edwin Meese and Caspar Weinberger. Next to his bed were red buttons labelled 'Nuke' and 'Nurse'. His wife Nancy was the butt of cosmetic surgery jokes.\n\nMikhail Gorbachev had his forehead birthmark in the shape of hammer and sickle. All other Russians looked like Leonid Brezhnev, often said \"da\" (\"yes\") and talked about potatoes. In Russia it was snowing even indoors and the Soviet television had extremely low-tech visual effects.\n\nFrançois Mitterrand was wearing a beret and a garlic wreath. P. W. Botha was shown as a racist cleverly disguising his views (once he had a badge \"anti-anti-apartheid\"). Adolf Hitler incognito had a house at 9 Downing Street. Some appearances were also made by Idi Amin, Robert Mugabe, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, Ruhollah Khomeini, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nOther international caricatures included Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger; George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle; Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, Konstantin Chernenko, Raisa Gorbachova and Boris Yeltsin.\n\nEngland manager Bobby Robson was a senile worrier nicknamed 'Rubbisho'. England midfielder Paul Gascoigne appeared, frequently crying – a parody of the 1990 World Cup semi-final against West Germany in which he famously cried after being booked, which would have ruled him out of the final had England won the game.\n\nIan Botham was a violent drug addict, while Mike Gatting spoke with a high voice. Lester Piggott had to be subtitled. Boxing characters included Frank Bruno with his trademark laugh and catchphrase \"where's 'Arry?\", and Chris Eubank, with his lisp. Snooker player Steve Davis was boring, upset because he had no nickname, but thought himself interesting.\n\nNews reporters were also depicted. Alastair Burnet was sycophantic towards the Royal Family and with a nose that inflated. Sandy Gall was effeminate, always worrying what coat he would wear. John Cole was incomprehensible and had to be dragged off-screen when he talked too long. Nicholas Witchell was always turning up during a strike to work rather than report. Kate Adie was a thrill-seeker, BBC Head of Bravery. Jeremy Paxman appeared as uninterested and self-loving. William Rees-Mogg was portrayed as a censorship-crazy person with eyes that would frequently pop out of the socket.\n\nDavid Coleman had a very loud ear prompter and sometimes did not know what he was commentating on. Frank Bough was portrayed as being a drug user. Bruce Forsyth spoke every sentence as though it was a catchphrase. Film critic Barry Norman was not a fan of his puppet, because it had a wart on its forehead. Paul Daniels did not mind jokes about his toupée but took offence to a sketch depicting him nuzzling his assistant Debbie McGee's breasts.\n\nComedian Billy Connolly was portrayed as a jester, and Jimmy Tarbuck was said to use old jokes and always take part in Royal Variety Performance. Bernard Manning was an obese racist, Ben Elton was always shown with a microphone. Writer and MP Jeffrey Archer appeared as an annoying, self-commenting writer whose books were not read by anyone. Alan Bennett was shown at home as watching \"Spitting Image\" on TV.\n\nA Mick Jagger character seemed perpetually high, and Keith Richards so old and haggard that he thought he was dead. Ringo Starr was a drunkard, and Paul McCartney was always releasing albums and films that flopped. Madonna changed her hair and clothes with every episode, and Michael Jackson's skin turned lighter. Luciano Pavarotti was hugely overweight and ate everything he saw. Cilla Black had large teeth and a thick Scouse accent.\n\nActor Dustin Hoffman spoke nasally and was parodied for his method acting. John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier were lamenting their friends, even their own death. Roger Moore was shown as an actor \"with a wooden delivery\" – only his eyebrows moved. Arnold Schwarzenegger was muscle-bound but insecure about the size of his genitals. Donald Sinden was parodied as also trying to become the greatest Shakespearian actor and get a knighthood. Clint Eastwood was frequently portrayed as a badass tough guy.\n\nArchbishop Robert Runcie, Mary Whitehouse and Cliff Richard were portrayed as Christian censors. Ian Paisley was always shouting and dressed in black. Pope John Paul II was a banjo-playing womaniser who spoke with a Texan accent.\n\nMedia moguls Robert Maxwell and Rupert Murdoch were also on the show, the latter depicted as an extremely flatulent individual encouraging obscenity in his mass media.\n\nLord Lucan appeared in various background roles often as a bar tender.\n\nThe first single from \"Spitting Image\", released in 1984, was a rework of the Crystals' \"Da Doo Ron Ron\". The \"Spitting Image\" version, \"Da Do Run Ron\", was a spoof election campaign song for Ronald Reagan, featuring Nancy Reagan listing reasons why \"you gotta re-elect him\", with lyrics like \"Yeah! He can really act, Yeah! He lowered income tax, Yeah! He hates the Warsaw Pact\". The cover of the single featured Reagan as a biker with Nancy riding pillion.\n\nThe B-side of this single was entitled \"Just A Prince Who Can't Say No\" and poked fun at the sexual indiscretions of The Prince Andrew. The TV version of this song (featured in the second ever episode) was heavily censored by Central Television on broadcast but presented uncut on vinyl. In the television series he was shown surrounded by various famous women including Joan Collins, Mary Whitehouse and Linda McCartney.\n\nIn 1986, the \"Spitting Image\" puppets had a number one hit in the UK charts with \"The Chicken Song\", parodying \"Agadoo\" by Black Lace – one of several parodies to have featured in the programme, mimicking moronic holiday songs with an annoyingly unforgettable tune and completely nonsensical lyrics. The Chicken Song hit number 1 in the charts for 3 weeks from 17 May 1986 – 3 June 1986 and VH1 US named it as one of the worst number 1 nominations.\n\nThe other songs released by \"Spitting Image\" were \"I've Never Met a Nice South African\" (which was on the B-Side of \"The Chicken Song\" and was a savage indictment of the apartheid-ridden country), \"We're Scared Of Bob\" (a parody of \"We Are The World\") and \"Hello You Must Be Going\" (which mocked Phil Collins's divorce ballads and was on the 12\" release of The Chicken Song), \"Santa Claus Is On The Dole\" (backed with \"The Atheist Tabernacle Choir\"), \"The Christmas Singles\" and \"Cry Gazza Cry\" (based on footballer Paul Gascoigne's tears in the 1990 World Cup), \"Meat\" (A parody of \"Streets of London\").\n\n\"The Chicken Song\" was by far the most successful of all of their music and not-so-subtle references were made to it in subsequent sketches in the show itself. In 1986, a compilation LP \"Spit In Your Ear\" was produced, featuring some of their sketches over time along with a few of their songs, followed in 1990 by \"20 Great Golden Gobs\", a songs-only collection from the 1986-1990 series.\n\nIn 1986, the \"Spitting Image\" team experienced some real musical success when they created the video for \"Land of Confusion\" by Genesis, a song which implied that Thatcher and Reagan were about to bring the world to a nuclear war. Phil Collins saw a disfigured version of himself on the show and contacted the show's producers with the idea to produce the video. Three new puppets were created depicting all members of Genesis (including a less exaggerated version of Collins), which also appear on the sleeve of the 45 (and later CD) single. The video was depicted as a nightmare Reagan was having, which left him completely immersed in sweat from worrying. It won a 1987 Grammy Award.\n\nThe end of the 1987 election featured a young boy, dressed as a city banker, singing \"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\", a parody of the film \"Cabaret\", when a member of the Hitler Youth starts singing the same song. In a series 5 episode, Labour leader Neil Kinnock is portrayed singing a self-parody to the tune \"My eyes are fully open\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Ruddigore\", supported by members of his shadow cabinet.\n\nIn one instance Sting was persuaded to sing a re-worded version of \"Every Breath You Take\", titled \"Every Bomb You Make\" (series 1, episode 12), to accompany a video showing the \"Spitting Image\" puppets of world leaders and political figures of the day, usually with the figure matching the altered lyrics \"Every bomb you make. Every job you take. Every heart you break, every Irish wake. I'll be watching you. Every wall you build, Every one you've killed, Every grave you've filled, all the blood you've spilled, I'll be watching you.\" The video ended with the grim reaper appearing in front of a sunset. This version was due to be resurrected by Sting at the Live 8 concert, and the parody lyrics were cleared with their writers Quentin Reynolds and James Glen, but plans were abandoned at the last minute.\n\nThe end theme of series 8 episode 3 all the characters performing the tribute song Jeremy Beadle and they sang about they hated him until his death in 2008. The end theme of series 9 episode 4 was \"Why Can't Life Be Like Hello?\", sung by June Brown (commonly known as the EastEnders character Dot Cotton).\nThe song pastiches \"Hello\" magazine, in satire of post-Big Bang UK consumerist culture.\n\nOther musical parodies featured Mick Jagger, Michael Jackson, Kylie Minogue, The Monkees, Pulp, Brett Anderson of Suede, Pet Shop Boys, R.E.M., Björk, East 17, Elvis Presley, Oasis, ZZ Top, Prince and Barbra Streisand.\n\n\"Spitting Image\" launched the careers of and featured many then-unknown British comedians and actors, most notably Hugh Dennis, Steve Coogan and Harry Enfield.\n\nThe voices were provided by British (and one American) impressionists including:\n\nThe puppets were operated by British performers, including:\n\nThe programme was first released on video in 1986 in a series of three collections, each a compilation of material from the first two series: \"Spit - With Polish!\", \"A Floppy Mass Of Blubber\" & \"Rubber Thingies\". All carried a 15 certificate and were reissued in 1988, also as a box set. 1989 saw the release by Central Video of two complete specials, \"Bumbledown: The Life & Times Of Ronald Reagan\" and \"The Sound Of Maggie\". Next was a video containing a collection of the music videos from the programme, titled \"The Klassik Music Video Vol 1\", released in 1991 by Central Video under The Video Collection Ltd (VCI or 2entertain); there was never a Volume 2.\n\n\"Is Nothing Sacred?\" was released in 1992 by Surprise Video, compiling material from 1990-1991. The free booklet was written by Stewart Lee and Richard Herring. \"Havin' It Off: The Bonker's Guide\" was released in 1993. In 1996 \"FA to Fairplay\" was released on VHS, later reissued on DVD in 2005. Made specially for video, it provided an alternative look at the 1996 European football championship held in England.\n\nThe Ronald Reagan song \"Da Do Run Ron\" featured in a straight to video release called \"Rockin' Ronnie\" (1986), an otherwise unrelated compilation of movie clips released by ATI Video.\n\nThe first twelve series including An 11-disc set (containing the first 7 series broadcast 1984-89) have been released by Network Distributing under licence by ITV Studios, so far. Series 1-7 individual releases are now deleted . DVD releases do not include any of the specials made.\n\nThe show was adapted into a video game: \"Spitting Image\" and a comics magazine.\n\n"}

It was published subtitled as \"Published Weekly, Devoted to the Propagation of Phonetic Shorthand, and Phonetic Reading, Writing and Printing.\"\n\nIt was printed starting 1841 by Isaac Pitman, and published by F. Pitman at the Phonetic Depot, at 20, Paternoster Row, in London. The journal was initially in 12 small pages plus a 4-page advertising and information wrapper per issue. It published materials in traditional spelling as well as in phonetic spelling, and phonetic shorthand. It also included news of the Phonetic Society and its members.\n\nThe journal promoted \"The Phonetic Alphabet\". It explained the alphabet promoted as \"consisting of 36 letters, namely the 23 useful letters of the common alphabet (c, q and x being rejected) and 13 new letters included. The vowels a, e, i, o, u were used for their short sound as in pat, pet, pit, pot and put and all the other letters having their usual signification\". \n\nA proposed order of the alphabet was as follows:\n\nConsonants: p, b; t, d; ç, j; k, g; f, v; [th], [dh], s, z; ʃ, ʒ; m, n, ŋ; l, r; w, y; h.\n\nVowels: a, ɐ; e, ɛ; i, [ee]; o, [o]; γ, σ; u, ɥ.\n\nDiphthongs: ei , iu , ou , ai , oi .\n\nThe alphabet also included 9 \"foreign sounds\", 7 from French and 2 from German.\n\nIsaac Pitman, the founder of the journal published \"Phonotypy\" in 1844, his major work on spelling reform just three years after the founding of the journal. Pitman and Alexander John Ellis, an English mathematician and philologist jointly proposed in 1845 an English Phonotypic Alphabet made up of 40 letters based mainly on the Phonetic Alphabet of \"The Phonetic Journal\" and that of \"The Phonotypic Journal\". Furthermore, in a book edited in 1848, under the title \"A Plea for Spelling Reform\", by Alexander John Ellis, edited by Isaac Pitman, the authors compiled a series of articles from \"The Phonetic Journal.\" and from other periodicals, recommending an enlarged alphabet and \"A Reformed Spelling of the English Language\" as a \"means of placing the arts of Reading and Writing within the reach of all who speak the English language or wish acquire it\", as Pitman said in the intro.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "12099794", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12099794", "title": "Tin-glazed pottery", "text": "Tin-glazed pottery\n\nTin-glazed pottery is earthenware covered in glaze containing tin oxide which is white, shiny and opaque (see tin-glazing for the chemistry); usually this provides a background for brightly painted decoration. It has been important in Islamic and European pottery, but very little used in East Asia. The pottery body is usually made of red or buff-colored earthenware and the white glaze imitated Chinese porcelain. The decoration on tin-glazed pottery is usually applied to the unfired glaze surface by brush with metallic oxides, commonly cobalt oxide, copper oxide, iron oxide, manganese dioxide and antimony oxide. The makers of Italian tin-glazed pottery from the late Renaissance blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings.\n\nThe earliest tin-glazed pottery appears to have been made in Iraq in the 9th century, the oldest fragments having been excavated during the First World War from the palace of Samarra about fifty miles north of Baghdad. From there it spread to Egypt, Persia and Spain before reaching Italy in the Renaissance, Holland in the 16th century and England, France and other European countries shortly after.\n\nThe development of white, or near white, firing bodies in Europe from the late 18th century, such as creamware by Josiah Wedgwood, and icreasingly cheap European porcelain and Chinese export porcelain, reduced the demand for tin-glaze Delftware, faience and majolica.\n\nThe rise in the cost of tin oxide during the First World War led to its partial substitution by zirconium compounds in the glaze.\n\nTin-glazed pottery of different periods and styles is known by different names. The pottery from Muslim Spain is known as \"Hispano-Moresque ware\". The decorated tin-glaze of Renaissance Italy is called \"maiolica\", sometimes pronounced and spelt \"majolica\" by English speakers and authors. When the technique was taken up in the Netherlands, it became known as \"delftware\" as much of it was made in the town of Delft. Dutch potters brought it to England in around 1600, and wares produced there are known as \"English delftware\" or \"galleyware\". In France it was known as \"faience\".\n\nThe word \"maiolica\" is thought to have come from the medieval Italian word for Majorca, an island on the route for ships that brought Hispano-Moresque wares to Italy from Valencia in the 15th and 16th centuries, or from the Spanish \"obra de Mallequa\", the term for lustered ware made in Valencia under the influence of Moorish craftsmen from Malaga. During the Renaissance, the term \"maiolica\" was adopted for Italian-made luster pottery copying Spanish examples, and, during the 16th century, its meaning shifted to include all tin-glazed earthenware.\n\nBecause of their identical names, there has been some confusion between tin-glazed majolica/maiolica and the lead-glazed majolica made in England and America in the 19th century, but they are different in origin, technique, style and history. In the late 18th century, old Italian tin-glazed maiolica became popular among the British, who referred to it by the anglicized pronunciation \"majolica\". The Minton pottery copied it and applied the term \"majolica ware\" to their product. At the Great Exhibition of 1851, Minton launched the colorful lead-glazed earthenware which they called \"Palissy ware\", soon also to become known as \"majolica\". So now we have two distinct products with the same name. \"In the 1870s, the curators of the South Kensington Museum returned to the original Italian 'maiolica' with an 'i' to describe all Italian tin-glazed earthenware, doubtless to stress the Italian pronunciation and to avoid confusion with contemporary majolica.\"\n\nW.B. Honey (Keeper of Ceramics at the Victoria & Albert Museum, 1938–1950) wrote of \"maiolica\" that, \"By a convenient extension and limitation the name may be applied to all tin-glazed ware, of whatever nationality, made in the Italian tradition … the name faïence (or the synonymous English 'delftware') being reserved for the later wares of the 17th Century onwards, either in original styles (as in the case of the French) or, more frequently, in the Dutch-Chinese (Delft) tradition.\" The term \"maiolica\" is sometimes applied to modern tin-glazed ware made by studio potters.\n\nThe Moors introduced tin-glazed pottery to Spain after the conquest of 711.\n\nHispano-Moresque ware is generally distinguished from the pottery of Christendom by the Islamic character of its decoration, though as the dish illustrated shows, it was also made for the Christian market.\n\nHispano-Moresque shapes of the 15th century included the \"albarello\" (a tall jar), luster dishes with coats of arms, made for wealthy Italians and Spaniards, jugs, some on high feet (the \"citra\" and the \"grealet\"), a deep-sided dish (the \"lebrillo de alo\") and the eared bowl (\"cuenco de oreja\").\n\nWith the Spanish conquest of Mexico, tin-glazed pottery came to be produced in the Valley of Mexico as early as 1540, at first in imitation of the ceramics imported from Seville.\n\nAlthough the Moors were expelled from Spain in the early 17th century, the Hispano-Moresque style survived in the province of Valencia. Later wares usually have a coarse reddish-buff body, dark blue decoration and luster.\n\nThe 15th-century wares that initiated maiolica as an art form were the product of a long technical evolution, in which medieval lead-glazed wares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the initial influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily. Such archaic wares are sometimes dubbed \"proto-maiolica\". During the later 14th century, the limited palette of colors was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to embrace cobalt blue, antimony yellow and iron-oxide orange. \"Sgraffito\" wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide slip was decoratively scratched to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware.\n\nRefined production of tin-glazed earthenware made for more than local needs was concentrated in central Italy from the later 13th century, especially in the \"contada\" of Florence. The city itself declined in importance in the second half of the 15th century, perhaps because of local deforestation. Italian cities encouraged the start of a new pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, monopoly rights and protection from outside imports. Production scattered among small communes and, after the mid-15th century, at Faenza, Arezzo and Siena. Faenza, which gave its name to faience, was the only fair-sized city in which the ceramic industry became a major economic component. Bologna produced lead-glazed wares for export. Orvieto and Deruta both produced \"maioliche\" in the 15th century. In the 16th century, maiolica production was established at Castel Durante, Urbino, Gubbio and Pesaro. Some maiolica was produced as far north as Padua, Venice and Turin and as far south as Palermo and Caltagirone in Sicily. In the 17th century Savona began to be a prominent place of manufacture.\n\nSome of the principal centers of production (e.g. Deruta and Montelupo) still produce maiolica, which is sold in quantity in Italian tourist areas.\n\nDelftware was made in the Netherlands from the 16th to the 18th centuries. The main period of manufacture was 1600-1780, after which it was succeeded by white stoneware and porcelain.\n\nThe earliest tin-glazed pottery in the Netherlands was made in Antwerp in 1512. The manufacture of painted pottery may have spread from the southern to the northern Netherlands in the 1560s. It was made in Middleburg and Haarlem in the 1570s and in Amsterdam in the 1580s. Much of the finer work was produced in Delft, but simple everyday tin-glazed pottery was made in such places as Gouda, Rotterdam, Amsterdam and Dordrecht.\n\nThe Guild of St. Luke, to which painters in all media had to belong, admitted ten master potters in the thirty years between 1610 and 1640 and twenty in the nine years 1651 to 1660. In 1654 a gunpowder explosion in Delft destroyed many breweries, and, as the brewing industry was in decline, their premises became available to pottery makers.\n\nFrom about 1615, the potters began to coat their pots completely in white tin glaze instead of covering only the painting surface and coating the rest with clear glaze. They then began to cover the tin glaze with a coat of clear glaze which gave depth to the fired surface and smoothness to cobalt blues, ultimately creating a good resemblance to porcelain.\n\nAlthough Dutch potters did not immediately imitate Chinese porcelain, they began to do after the death of the Emperor Wan-Li in 1619, when the supply to Europe was interrupted. Delftware inspired by Chinese originals persisted from about 1630 to the mid-18th century alongside European patterns.\n\nDelftware ranged from simple household items to fancy artwork. Pictorial plates were made in abundance, illustrated with religious motifs, native Dutch scenes with windmills and fishing boats, hunting scenes, landscapes and seascapes. The Delft potters also made tiles in vast numbers (estimated at eight hundred million over a period of two hundred years); many Dutch houses still have tiles that were fixed in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nDelftware became popular, was widely exported in Europe and reached China and Japan. Chinese and Japanese potters made porcelain versions of Delftware for export to Europe.\n\nBy the late 18th century, Delftware potters had lost their market to British porcelain and the new white earthenware.\n\nThere are good collections of old Delftware in the Rijksmuseum and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\n\nEnglish delftware was made in the British Isles between about 1550 and the late 18th century. The main centers of production were London, Bristol and Liverpool with smaller centers at Wincanton, Glasgow and Dublin.\n\nJohn Stow's \"Survey of London\" (1598) records the arrival in 1567 of two Antwerp potters, Jasper Andries and Jacob Jansen, in Norwich, where they made \"Gally Paving Tiles, and vessels for Apothecaries and others, very artificially\". In 1579 Jansen applied to Queen Elizabeth I for the sole right to practice \"galleypotting\" in London and soon set up a workshop at Aldgate to the east of the city. There were already other Flemish potters in London, two of them in Southwark recorded in 1571 as \"painters of pottes\".\n\nEnglish delftware pottery and its painted decoration is similar in many respects to that from Holland, but its peculiarly English quality has been commented upon: \"... there is a relaxed tone and a sprightliness which is preserved throughout the history of English delftware; the overriding mood is provincial and naive rather than urbane and sophisticated.\" Its methods and techniques were less sophisticated than those of its continental counterparts.\n\nThe earliest known piece with an English inscription is a dish dated 1600 in the London Museum. It is painted in blue, purple, green, orange and yellow and depicts the Tower of London and Old London Bridge, surrounded by the words, \"THE ROSE IS RED THE LEAVES ARE GRENE GOD SAVE ELIZABETH OUR QUEENE\" and an Italianate border of masks and leaves. The rim is decorated with dashes of blue and can be considered the first in series of large decorated dishes so painted and called blue-dash chargers. Blue-dash chargers, usually between about 25 and 35 cm in diameter with abstract, floral, religious, patriotic or topographical motifs, were produced in quantity by London and Bristol potters until the early 18th century. As they were kept for decoration on walls, dressers and side-tables, many have survived and they are well represented in museum collections.\n\nSmaller and more everyday wares were also made: paving tiles, mugs, drug jars, dishes, wine bottles, posset pots, salt pots, candlesticks, fuddling cups, puzzle jugs, barber's bowls, pill slabs, bleeding bowls, porringers, and flower bricks.\n\nTowards the end of the 17th century, changing taste led to the replacement of apothecary pots, paving tiles and large dishes by polite tablewares, delicate ornaments, punch bowls, teapots, cocoa pots and coffee-pots.\n\nThere are good examples of English delftware in the Victoria and Albert Museum, the British Museum, the Ashmolean Museum and the Fitzwilliam Museum.\n\nIn France, the first well-known painter of faïence was Masseot Abaquesne, established in Rouen in the 1530s. Other centres of faience manufacturing developed from the early 18th century, led in 1690 by Quimper in Brittany , which today possesses a museum devoted to faience, and followed by Nevers, Moustiers and Marseille, Strasbourg and Lunéville.\n\nThe products of faience manufactories are identified by the usual methods of ceramic connoisseurship: the character of the clay body, the character and palette of the glaze, and the style of decoration, \"faïence blanche\" being left in its undecorated fired white slip. \"Faïence parlante\" bears mottoes often on decorative labels or banners. Apothecary wares, including \"albarelli\", can bear the names of their intended contents, generally in Latin and often so abbreviated to be unrecognizable to the untutored eye. Mottoes of fellowships and associations became popular in the 18th century, leading to the \"faïence patriotique\" that was a specialty of the years of the French Revolution.\n\nPopular and folk forms have continued in many countries, including the Mexican Talavera.\n\nIn the 20th century there were changes in the formulation of tin-glaze and several artist potters began to work in the medium of tin-glazed pottery.\n\nThe cost of tin oxide rose considerably during the 1918-1918 war and resulted in a search for cheaper alternatives. The first successful replacement was zirconia and later zircon. Whilst zirconium compounds are not as effective opacifiers as tin oxide, their relatively low price has led to a gradual increase in their use, with an associated reduction in the use of tin oxide. The whiteness resulting from the use of zirconia has been described as more \"clinical\" than that from tin oxide and is preferred in some applications. Nevertheless, tin oxide still finds use in ceramic manufacture and has been widely used as the opacifier in sanitaryware, with up to 6% used in glazes. Otherwise, tin oxide in glazes, often in conjunction with zircon compounds, is generally restricted to specialist low temperature applications and use by studio potters.\n\nIn England at the end of the nineteenth century, William de Morgan re-discovered the technique of firing luster on tin-glaze \"to an extraordinarily high standard\". Since the beginning of the 20th century there has been a revival of pottery-making in Orvieto and Deruta, the traditional centres of tin-glazed ceramics in Italy, where the shapes and designs of the medieval and renaissance period are reproduced. In the 1920s and 1930s, Roger Fry, Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant decorated tin-glazed pottery for the Omega Workshops in London. Picasso produced and designed much tin-glazed pottery at Vallauris in the south of France in the 1940s and 1950s. At the Central School of Arts and Crafts, London, Dora Billington encouraged her students, including William Newland and Alan Caiger-Smith, to use tin-glaze decoration. In Britain during the 1950s Caiger-Smith, Margaret Hine, Nicholas Vergette and others including the Rye Pottery made tin-glazed pottery, going against the trend in studio pottery towards stoneware. Subsequently, Caiger-Smith experimented with the technique of reduced lustre on tin glaze, which had been practiced in Italy until 1700 and Spain until 1800 and had then been forgotten. Caiger-Smith trained several potters at his Aldermaston Pottery and published \"Tin-glaze Pottery\" which gives a history of maiolica, delftware and faience in Europe and the Islamic world. A selection of tin glaze pottery by contemporary Studio potters is given \"Tin-glazed Earthenware\" by Daphne Carnegy.\n\nThe pottery Royal Tichelaar Makkum, located in Makkum, Friesland, continue the production of Delftware using tin-glazed earthenware.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3514696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3514696", "title": "Translating \"law\" to other European languages", "text": "Translating \"law\" to other European languages\n\nThe translation of \"law\" to other European languages faces several difficulties. In most European languages, as well as some others influenced by European languages, there are two different words that can be translated to English as \"law\". For the general comparison in this article the Latin terms \"ius\" and \"lex\" will be used. Etymologically, \"ius\" has some relation to \"right\", \"just\" or \"straight\".\n\nThere are in English two more or less synonymous adjectives, both from Latin origin, that correspond etymologically to the Continental distinction: the common word \"legal\" and the less common \"juridical\" (or even \"juristic\"). However, the words \"ius\" and \"lex\" are not synonyms.\n\n\"Lex\" can sometimes be translated as \"legislation\", \"statute\", \"statutory law\" or even \"act\", even if the corresponding \"legislatio\", \"statutus\" and \"actus\" also exist. \"Lex\" is law made by a political authority, such as the Parliament or the Government. In modern societies, \"leges\" are usually written, though this is not a necessary feature. \"Lex\" is often used in the plural (\"leges\"), since each act is one \"lex\".\n\nOn the other hand, \"ius\" is also polysemous, since it can mean either \"law\" or \"right\". Continental legal scholars sometimes make a distinction between \"subjective \"ius\"\" (any legal right) and \"objective \"ius\"\" (the whole law), but this does not happen in ordinary language. The two senses of \"ius\" can be easily distinguished in most cases.\n\nWhen \"ius\" means \"law\", it usually has some semantic connection to \"what is right\", \"just\" or \"straight\". For instance, the German motto \"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\" (literally \"Unity and law and freedom\")) has been translated as \"Unity and justice and freedom\", even though there is a different word for \"justice\" (\"Gerechtigkeit\"). \"Lex\" does not have such a connection. Some translators of Kant's and Hegel's works have translated \"Recht\" as \"objective right\" (see Steiner, 2002, p. 276), although those works, especially Kant's, are just about law or, at most, about the best law.\n\nPresent day continental law schools and faculties claim to study \"ius\". Mediaeval universities, on the contrary, usually had a faculty of \"leges\". English Wikipedia's article on \"law\" links to other languages Wikipedias' articles on the equivalent to \"ius\".\n\nThere are a few European languages other than English where \"law\" translates into one word, such as Polish \"prawo\". On the other side, a prominent non-European language which makes the distinction is Arabic, where قانون (\"qānūn\") is equivalent to \"lex\" and ﺣـق (\"ḥaqq\") is equivalent to \"ius\".\n\nTo clarify the difference one may look at how these phrases translated into Spanish:\n\nIn bilingual and multilingual jurisdictions, a careful translation is needed in legal contexts to avoid ambiguity. Even excellent translation cannot capture all the connotations of the original words, however, and many scholars argue for bilingual judges who can parse both versions of the text.\n\nIn Canada since 1891 the \"equal authenticity rule\" has held that the French and English versions of all federal laws are considered equally authoritative. Nevertheless, the English and French texts of important may not translate exactly, which leaves open the possibility that justices may understand the same law to mean two different things. This includes the problem of \"law\" versus \"\"droit\". For example, Osgoode Hall scholar Robert Leckey argues that in the 2006 Multani case over the banning of kirpans (Sikh ceremonial daggers) by a school board in Quebec, the justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, despite all writing their reasons in French, disagreed over the meaning of the phrase \"ne peuvent être restreints que par une règle de droit\"\" in Section 1 of the \"Charter of Rights and Freedoms\", which appears in the English version of the text as \"not prescribed by law\". Relying on different cultural and academic backgrounds (Quebec's civil law and francophone administrative culture, versus the English common law and British traditions elsewhere in Canada) they either decided that the action of school board in banning the kirpan was, or was not, \"une règle de droit\" or \"law\" (without reference to the word \"prescribed\"). Lackey asserts that \"[i]n administrative law from France, and in administrative law scholarship written in French in Quebec, a regulation is 'une règle de droit' and a decision is not 'une règle de droit'\" whereas in English-language scholarship the difference between \"prescribed by law\" and not \"prescribed by law\" has nothing to do with a distinction between general norms and individual decisions.\n\nThis difference between English and other European languages is sometimes invoked in the debates between legal positivism, natural law and interpretivism. Berkowitz (2005) argues that the rise of legal positivism corresponds to a \"transformation of the sense of 'law', a difficult topic made more so by a particular limitation of the English language\", the non-distinction between \"ius\" and \"lex\". Hart himself, in \"The concept of law\" (pp. 206 ff.), argued that the distinction between \"ius\" and \"lex\" might clarify the relation between law and morality. A similar point is made by Gardner (2004) in order to distinguish between \"law\" in general and \"legal law\".\n\nFor the sake of examples, this article uses the Latin words.\n\nContinental legal positivists of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century claimed that all \"ius\" is \"lex\".\n\nIn German \"Law Schools\" sometimes the following allegory is told: The word \"Recht\" is closely related to the word \"Rache\" (which is \"revenge\" in English language). It brings in the idea of \"an eye for an eye\" as first instrument to overcome uncontrolled revenge. From this point of view, Recht is institutionalized Rache. But this means: If someone says: \"I had 'the right' to do this.\", he should say: \"I did it out of revenge.\", as the person is not a \"legal\" institution...\n\n"}

It combines elements of \"tsunde-oku\" (, to pile things up ready for later and leave) and \"dokusho\" (, reading books). It is also used to refer to books ready for reading later when they are on a bookshelf. As currently written, the word combines the characters for \"pile up\" () and the character for \"read\" ().\nA. Edward Newton is quoted as saying:\n\n"}

The aim of the program is to promote an understanding of international preservation policies, methods and techniques that lead to a continuing dialogue between countries. As of 2007, nearly 600 young preservation professionals and over 70 countries have participated in this program since its creation in 1984.\n\nThe program began with a one-time exchange between US/ICOMOS and ICOMOS United Kingdom. It since has expanded to involve between 20 and 30 young preservation professionals each year. US/ICOMOS internships are geared toward individuals who are in their last year of a relevant graduate program or have been working for 1–3 years in a professional capacity. The program is very competitive in that only 1 in 5 applicants are awarded internships in any given year.\n\nInterns are selected on a competitive basis for participation in the US/ICOMOS International Exchange Program. Internships are approximately 12 weeks in length and are usually held during the summer (from June to August), although some internships may be held at other times of the year. US/ICOMOS hosts all U.S. and international interns for a program orientation in Washington, DC. Interns then disperse to their various host organizations where they complete a preservation-related project designed by the host organization. At the end of the summer, all interns reconvene in Washington, DC for a final farewell program.\n\nThe program is made possible through generous grants from many U.S. foundations, government agencies and individual contributors, and ICOMOS National Committees of participating countries.\n\nInterns must be graduate students or young professionals with at minimum an undergraduate degree in a preservation-related field. Candidates are asked to submit a curriculum vitae, two letters of recommendation, a 500-word essay describing their reasons for wanting to participate in the program, and examples of their work. Participants are selected on the basis of skill, demonstrated commitment to historic preservation, previous experience and academic concentration in the field and the ability to represent their country in an exchange program. In addition, interns are chosen whose skills, training, interest and previous experience match the needs of host organizations. Applications submitted by U.S. citizens are selected for specific internships by a jury of professional members of US/ICOMOS; applications from other ICOMOS national committees are screened at the national committee level, and then forwarded to US/ICOMOS for selection and assignments. The file of the strongest candidate(s) for a particular internship is sent to the host office (in the U.S. and in participating countries) for review and final approval.\n\n"}
