It seems likely that the monuments were built at different times, and possibly for different purposes. Becca Banks/the Ridge has a strongly defensive nature, and may have been built to control a ford over the Cock Beck. Becca Banks/the Ridge runs across the Roman road between Castleford and Tadcaster. However the sequential relationship between the earthwork and the Roman road is not known. Some argue the monument was built to defend against a Roman invasion and the road was later built right through it. Others argue the monument was built to protect the road, possibly in the 'Dark Ages'.\nWhere subjected to archaeological excavation, the monuments have been found to date from or after the late Iron Age, and it would seem they were silting up during the early Medieval period.\n\nBecca Banks/the Ridge is the principal monument in the group. This runs for nearly on a mostly east-west course along the north side of the Cock Beck valley. It consists of a bank with a ditch situated on its southern (downslope) side. A slight natural scarp slope is exploited in the positioning of the bank above the ditch, and the top of the bank would have stood up to above the base of the ditch.\n\nThe other two monuments are located on the south side of the Cock Beck valley, and do not share the strong defensive characteristics of Becca Banks/the Ridge. For instance, the ditch of the South Dyke lies on the upslope side of its bank.\n\nAs scheduled monuments, the Aberford Dykes are legally protected. They still have a role in the modern landscape, serving as field boundaries and marking county and parish boundaries. Much of the length of the Aberford Dykes can be walked via the public footpaths that run along them.\n\n\n"}

He was the first Adams Professor of Arabic at the University of Cambridge, from around 1632. According to Robert Irwin he regarded it as part of his academic duty to discourage students from taking up the subject. Thomas Hyde was one of his pupils.\n\nWheelock was appointed librarian of the \"Public Library\" (i.e. Cambridge University Library) in 1629, and was also Reader in Anglo-Saxon. In 1632 he oversaw the transferral of Thomas van Erpe's collection of oriental books and manuscripts to Cambridge University Library after its purchase by George Villiers, which brought with it the first book in Chinese to be added to the Library's collections. He produced the \"editio princeps\" of the Old English version of Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\" and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" (1643–4). In the same work he published an important edition—and the first in England—of Bede's \"Ecclesiastical History\" in its original Latin text opposite the Old English version, along with Anglo-Saxon laws. Many of the notes in this edition consist of the Old English homilies of Aelfric of Eynsham, which Wheelocke translated himself into Latin. In the following year (1644), London publisher Cornelius Bee put another, enlarged edition out which also included an updated version of William Lambarde's legal text \"Archaionomia.\" This text was likely a collaboration between Wheelock and his friend Sir Roger Twysden.\n\nHe graduated MA from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1618, and became Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge in 1619.\n\n\"Quatuor evangeliorum domini nostri Jesu Christi versio Persica Syriacam & Arabicam suavissimè redolens\" was a trilingual version of the Four Gospels, published in the same year as the London Polyglot, to which he also contributed.\n\n\n\n"}

The Arab Chamber of Commerce is a not for profit organisation, The President is Edwin Hitti.\n\nThe Arab Chamber established the first Shariah Advisory Council in Hong Kong, made up of experts in the Islamic code of law. It was established because of the great of Shariah compliance of banking services, financial products, and commercial establishments requiring compliance supervision and regulation, and the lack of services that was provided in Hong Kong and China. The Shariah Advisory Council, established by The Chamber, filled that gap and to this day has provided council and regulation for many establishments throughout Hong Kong and China.\n\nThe HK Islamic Index (HKII), was established in 2007 by the Chamber to support Hong Kong's ambitions to develop into an Shariah compliant, Islamic banking and financial centre and was the first time a chamber of commerce had taken the initiative to create its own equity index. Reuters, Bloomberg, and Quamnet have been contracted to disseminate the HK Islamic Index. The HKII comprises 78 companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with 39 each from Hong Kong and mainland China. The Hong Kong Islamic Index was valued at HK$1,419 as of 20 June 2011. Stocks under the index are listed from the Real Estate, Transportation, Information Technology, Industrial Goods, Utilities, Energy, Material, Telecommunications, or Consumer Goods sectors.\n\nThe Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry recognised that when The Chamber was established there was a lack of Islamic Banking in Hong Kong and China. In 2009 it established the Amwal Credit Union, which would provide Shariah compliant, Islamic banking and finance based on the core principles of community and individual responsibility, environmental responsibility, and Islamically permissible banking practices.\nThe Amwal Credit Union is the first Islamic Credit Union in the world and the first licensed Islamic cooperative financial institution in Hong Kong, and the sole Shariah Compliant credit union within the Greater China region.\n\nThe Amwal Credit Union is a member of the Credit Union League of Hong Kong, and the Association of Development Financing Institutions in Asia and the Pacific (ADFIAP).\n\nThe International Islamic Mediation & Arbitration Centre (IMAC) is an independent international institution established pursuant to a resolution agreed by the Chamber on 31 July 2008 in Hong Kong and in consultation with The International Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe Centre was established to conduct the following:\n\nWith these goals in mind the Centre has held training courses on Shariah and arbitration for members of the judicial sector in Hong Kong and China.\n\nThe Mosque Building Fund (MBF) is a charitable building fund established by The Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry, in 2008, to collect donations and provide funding in Hong Kong to build mosques, community centres, and other public facilities for the Islamic community. Donations, called Zakat, are collected from individuals or institutions. The payment of a Zakat is mandatory under one of the five pillars of Islam. With currently 175,000 Muslims in Hong Kong there is a great need of services specifically designed for their religion.\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute of Islamic Studies (HKIS) was established by The Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2008 and offers educational programs in Islamic Law (Shariah), Islamic Finance and Banking, and Islamic Insurance (Takaful). Programs are offered in cooperation with the Institute of Professional Education and Knowledge of Hong Kong.\n\nThe establishment of the Chamber and its other organizations have been supported by many organizations:\n\nThe Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry is a member of the Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), ICC- World Chambers Network (WCN), World Association of Non-Governmental Organizations (WANGO), and a subscriber to the World Bank- Civil Society Organization.\n"}
{"id": "233963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233963", "title": "Archaism", "text": "Archaism\n\nIn language, an archaism (from the , \"archaïkós\", 'old-fashioned, antiquated', ultimately , \"archaîos\", 'from the beginning, ancient') is a word, a sense of a word, or a style of speech or writing that belongs to a historical epoch long beyond living memory, but that has survived in a few practical settings or affairs. Lexical archaisms are single archaic words or expressions used regularly in an affair (e.g. religion or law) or freely; literary archaism is the survival of archaic language in a traditional literary text such as a nursery rhyme or the deliberate use of a style characteristic of an earlier age—for example, in his 1960 novel \"The Sot-Weed Factor\", John Barth writes in an 18th-century style. All archaic words or expressions have distinctive emotional connotations—some can be humorous (\"forsooth\"), some highly formal (\"What say you?\"), and some solemn (\"With thee do I plight my troth\").\n\nArchaisms are most frequently encountered in history, poetry, fantasy literature, law, philosophy, science, technology, geography and ritual writing and speech. Archaisms are kept alive by these ritual and literary uses and by the study of older literature. Should they remain recognised, they can potentially be revived.\n\nBecause they are things of continual discovery and re-invention, science and technology have historically generated forms of speech and writing which have dated and fallen into disuse relatively quickly. However the emotional associations of certain words (for example: 'Wireless' rather than 'Radio' for a generation of British citizens who lived through the Second World War) have kept them alive even though the older word is clearly an archaism.\n\nA similar desire to evoke a former age means that archaic place names are frequently used in circumstances where doing so conveys a political or emotional subtext, or when the official new name is not recognised by all (for example: 'Madras' rather than 'Chennai'). So, a restaurant seeking to conjure up historic associations might prefer to call itself \"Old Bombay\" or refer to \"Persian cuisine\" in preference to using the newer place name. A notable contemporary example is the name of the airline Cathay Pacific, which uses the archaic Cathay (\"China\").\n\nArchaisms are frequently misunderstood, leading to changes in usage. One example is found in the phrase \"the odd man out\", which originally came from the phrase \"to find the odd man out\", where the verb \"to find out\" has been split by its object \"the odd man\", meaning the item which does not fit.\n\nThe compound adverbs and prepositions found in the writing of lawyers (\"e.g. heretofore, hereunto, thereof\") are examples of archaisms as a form of jargon. Some phraseologies, especially in religious contexts, retain archaic elements that are not used in ordinary speech in any other context: \"With this ring I thee wed.\" Archaisms are also used in the dialogue of historical novels in order to evoke the flavour of the period. Some may count as inherently funny words and are used for humorous effect.\n\nA type of archaism is the use of \"thou\", the second-person singular pronoun that fell out of general use in the 17th century, while \"you\" or \"ye\", formerly only used to address groups, and then also to respectfully address individuals, is now used to address both individuals and groups (but since this can result in ambiguity, \"y'all\" can be used to re-introduce the distinction). \"Thou\" is the nominative form; the oblique/objective form is \"thee\" (functioning as both accusative and dative), and the possessive is \"thy\" or \"thine\".\n\nThough thou hast ever so many counsellors, yet [\"yet\" is generally not an archaism, but it is in this context] do not forsake the counsel of thy own soul.\nToday me, tomorrow thee.\n\nThe meaning of this proverb is that something that happens to a person, is likely to eventually happen to another who observes it, especially if the two people are similar.\n\nTo thine own self be true.\n\nThe meaning of this saying is simply that it is unwise to lie to yourself. In its contemporary context it meant to be true (loyal, faithful, supportive) to one's own interests (the 'self' of person, property, and goals). In other words, put yourself before others.\n\nArchaisms in proverbs are often retained, far longer than in other parts of the language. This is because they make the proverbs \"fall easier on the tongue\",\nand also because of the rhetorical effect they evoke by the use of two of the four fundamental operations in rhetoric. Namely, permutation (immutatio) and addition (adiectio).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11996323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11996323", "title": "Contemporary archaeology", "text": "Contemporary archaeology\n\nContemporary archaeology is a field of archaeological research that focuses on the most recent (20th and 21st century) past, and also increasingly explores the application of archaeological thinking to the contemporary world. It has also been referred to as the archaeology of the 'contemporary past'. The use of this term in the United Kingdom is particularly associated with the Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in Theory (CHAT) conference group. The field forms part of historical archaeology, or the archaeology of the modern period. Unlike ethnoarchaeology, contemporary archaeology studies the recent and contemporary past in its own right, rather than to develop models that can inform the study of the more distant past.\n\nOften informed by anthropological material culture studies, but characterised by putting traditional archaeological methods and practices to new uses, research in this field generally aims to make an archaeological contribution to broader social scientific studies of the contemporary world, focusing especially upon contributing methods of studying material things (objects, landscapes, buildings, material heritage, etc.) to sociological, geographical and political studies of the modern world. The field has developed especially in heritage management, for example through English Heritage's \"Change and Creation\" programme on the landscapes of the later 20th century As such, Contemporary Archaeology aims to explore the characteristics of diverse and rapid change across micro and macro scales by using a range of conventional and experimental Archaeology investigative techniques. Like all archaeological scholarship and practice, Contemporary Archaeology uses both inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning approaches, which can include archaeological modelling.\n\n\"Quentin Lewis recognized, contemporary archaeology has a firmer footing in the UK and Europe than it does in North America, or at least it is not an especially recognizable scholarly niche quite yet in the US. The work of scholars in the UK and Europe has turned to some materiality that is admittedly distinctive if not unique, such as the extensive scholarship of the landscapes of 20th century warfare (for instance, English Heritage’s ambitious Cold War Monuments project, Gabriel Moshenska’s work on British air raid shelters and children’s homefront experiences of World War II, Heinrich Natho’s study of Norwegian World War II coastal defenses, and Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal’s analysis of Spanish Civil War Monuments); Laura McAtackney’s work on “peace walls” in northern Ireland; Anna Badcock and Robert Johnston’s study of protest camp sites in Derbyshire; and contemporary graffiti (John Schofield has cleverly captivated many journalists and questioned what archaeologists value with his assessment of Sex Pistols graffiti). Yet for all these distinctive dimensions of British and European heritage we could certainly point to just as many equally interesting material experiences in every corner of North America. Some of the visibility of contemporary archaeology is inevitably linked to a British and European willingness to conduct material analysis that does not require excavation. Outside North America a vast number of scholars call themselves archaeologists while studying space, the built environment, and a broad range of material things without necessarily wielding a trowel. In the US historical archaeology has fashioned a particularly productive niche by focusing on field excavation and everyday materiality, and much of our training is devoted to field methods and analysis of a distinctive range of commodities like ceramics, glass, and faunal remains that are routinely recovered from excavation contexts on nearly any historic period site\" \n\nDespite a history reaching back as far, at least, as William Rathje's \"garbology\" project, Contemporary Archaeology remains a new sub-discipline within the university. In remaining focused on archaeology's ability to tell stories that reach beyond official or formal discourse, Contemporary Archaeology has the potential to offer significant political critique.\n\n\n"}

The artist Roy Ascott elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in \"Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision\" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in \"The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose\" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian Edward A. Shanken has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including \"Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s\" and \"From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott\"(2003), which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to telematic art (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to net.art.)\n\nAudio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. Steina and Woody Vasulka, for example, used \"all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media.\"\n\nWith related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, Wen-Ying Tsai and cybernetician Gordon Pask and the animist kinetics of Robert Breer and Jean Tinguely, the 1960s produced a strain of cyborg art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cyborg art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and Gene Youngblood drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist Roy Ascott with his essay \"Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision\" in the journal Cybernetica (1976), and the American critic and theorist Jack Burnham. In \"Beyond Modern Sculpture\" from 1968 he builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.\n\nLeading art theorists and historians in this field include Christiane Paul, Frank Popper, Christine Buci-Glucksmann, Dominique Moulon, Robert C. Morgan, Roy Ascott, Margot Lovejoy, Edmond Couchot, Fred Forest and Edward A. Shanken.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1533819", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1533819", "title": "Eye dialect", "text": "Eye dialect\n\nEye dialect is the use of nonstandard spelling for speech to draw attention to pronunciation. The term was coined by George Philip Krapp to refer to the literary technique of using nonstandard spelling that implies a pronunciation of the given word that is actually standard, such as \"wimmin\" for \"women\"; the spelling indicates that the character's speech overall is dialectal, foreign, or uneducated. This form of nonstandard spelling differs from others in that a difference in spelling does not indicate a difference in pronunciation of a word. That is, it is dialect to the eye rather than to the ear. It suggests that a character \"would use a vulgar pronunciation if there were one\" and \"is at the level of ignorance where one misspells in this fashion, hence mispronounces as well\".\n\nThe term is less commonly also used to refer to pronunciation spellings, that is, spellings of words that indicate that they are pronounced in a nonstandard way. For example, an author might write \"dat\" as an attempt at accurate transcription of a nonstandard pronunciation of \"that\". The rest of this article will discuss the former definition.\n\nSome notable authors who use eye dialect include \nHarriet Beecher Stowe,\nMaya Angelou,\nCharles Dickens,\nWilliam Faulkner,\nGreer Gilman,\nAlex Haley, \nJoel Chandler Harris,\nRussell Hoban,\nTerry Pratchett,\nJames Whitcomb Riley,\nRobert Ruark,\nJohn Steinbeck, and\nMark Twain. \nHowever, most authors are likely to use eye dialect with restraint, sprinkling nonstandard misspelling here and there to serve as a cue to the reader about all of a character's speech, rather than as an accurate phonetic representation.\n\nWhile mostly used in dialogue, eye dialect may appear in the narrative depiction of altered spelling made \"by\" a character (such as in a letter or diary entry), generally used to more overtly depict characters who are poorly educated or semi-literate.\n\nThe term \"eye dialect\" was first used by George Philip Krapp in 1925. \"The convention violated\", he wrote, \"is one of the eyes, not of the ear.\". According to Krapp, it was not used to indicate a real difference in pronunciation but \n\nIn an article on written representations of speech in a \"non-literary\" context, for instance transcription by sociolinguists, Denis R.Preston argued that such spellings serve mainly to \"denigrate the speaker so represented by making him or her appear boorish, uneducated, rustic, gangsterish, and so on\". \n\nJane Raymond Walpole points out that there are other ways to indicate speech variation such as altered syntax, punctuation, and colloquial or regional word choices. She observes that a reader must be prompted to access their memory of a given speech pattern and that non-orthographic signals that accomplish this may be more effective than eye dialect. Frank Nuessel points out that use of eye dialect closely interacts with stereotypes about various groups, both relying on and reinforcing them in an attempt to efficiently characterize speech.\n\nIn \"The Lie That Tells a Truth: A Guide to Writing Fiction\", John Dufresne cites \"The Columbia Guide to Standard American English\" in suggesting that writers avoid eye dialect; he argues that it is frequently pejorative, making a character seem stupid rather than regional, and is more distracting than helpful. Like Walpole, Dufresne suggests that dialect should be rendered by \"rhythm of the prose, by the syntax, the diction, idioms and figures of speech, by the vocabulary indigenous to the locale\".\n\nEye dialect, when consistently applied, may render a character's speech indecipherable. An attempt to accurately render nonstandard speech may also prove difficult to readers unfamiliar with a particular accent.\n\nCharles Dickens may have used eye dialect more than any other prominent author in English. He combined it with pronunciation spelling and nonstandard grammar in the speech of his uneducated characters. An example in \"Bleak House\" is dialogue spoken by Jo, the miserable boy who sweeps a path across a street:\n\nHere \"wos, sed,\" and \"wuns\" indicate standard pronunciations.\n\nIn his Discworld series, Terry Pratchett makes extensive use of eye dialect to extend the caricature of his characters, even going to the point of changing the font used for certain dialogue. Death, for example, speaks in small capitals, while the dialogue of a golem, who can only communicate by writing, resembles Hebrew script in reference to the origins of the golem legend. Eye dialect is also used to establish a medieval setting, wherein many characters' grasp of spelling is heavily based on phonetics.\n\nAmerican cartoonist Al Capp frequently combined eye dialect with pronunciation spelling in his comic strip \"Li'l Abner\". Examples include \"lissen, aristocratick, mountin\" [mountain], \"correkt, feends, hed, introduckshun, leppard,\" and perhaps the most common, \"enuff\". Only his rustic characters are given these spellings; for instance, the \"overcivilized\" Bounder J. Roundheels's dialogue contains \"gourmets\", while Li'l Abner's contains \"goormays\".\n\nCartoonist Walt Kelly made extensive use of eye dialect in his classic strip \"Pogo\". Like Pratchett, he used unique fonts for many of his supporting cast.\n\nSome cartoonists and comic book creators eschew phonetic eye dialects in favor of font changes or distinctive speech balloons – \"Swamp Thing\", for example, has traditionally been depicted using \"crusty\" yellow speech balloons and dialogue heavily laced with ellipses, suggesting a gravelly voice that only speaks with great effort. Robotic and computer characters often use square speech balloons and angular fonts reminiscent of OCR-A, suggesting a stilted, emotionless cadence, etc.\n\nAmerican film director Quentin Tarantino used eye dialect for the title of his movie \"Inglourious Basterds\".\n\nOne popular theory that has gained mainstream acceptance by linguists since the 1960s is that the expression OK comes from \"Oll Korrect\" – all correct.\n\nIn the Chilean comic \"Mampato\", the character Ogú replaces hard ⟨c⟩ with ⟨k⟩ (e.g. ⟨komida⟩ instead of ⟨comida⟩), to show that his accent is strange.\n\nIn Russian, Vasiliy Shukshin's story \"Мой зять украл машину дров\" (\"My son-in-law stole a carful of firewood\") has the main character say \"Што?\" for \"What?\" instead of the expected \"Что?\" (что is normally pronounced , not , as if it were spelled \"што\"). The character is a delivery driver in Siberia and the eye dialect emphasizes his uneducated nature.\n\nThe novel \"Zazie dans le Métro\" is famously written in French that disregards almost all French spelling conventions.\n\nThe Norwegian author Hans Jæger's trilogy \"The Erotic Confessions of the Bohemians\" (1893–1903) is written in a Norwegian form of eye dialect.\n\nThe whole Russian Padonki dialect is based on deliberate misspelling of words.\n\n\n\n"}

Their name means “circle of clay” referring to how they were arranged in a circle above the tomb. The protruding parts of the figures were made separately and then attached, while a few things were carved into them. They were smoothed out by a wooden paddle. Terraces were arranged to place them with a cylindrical base into the ground, where the earth would hold them in place.\n\nDuring the Kofun period, a highly aristocratic society with militaristic rulers developed. The cavalry wore iron armor, carried swords and other weapons, and used advanced military methods like those of northeast Asia. Many of them are represented in \"haniwa\" figurines for funerary purposes.\n\nThe most important of the \"haniwa\" were found in southern Honshū—especially the Kinai region around Nara—and northern Kyūshū. \"Haniwa\" grave offerings were made in many forms, such as horses, chickens, birds, fans, fish, houses, weapons, shields, sunshades, pillows, and humans. Besides decorative and spiritual reasons of protecting the deceased in his afterlife, these figures served as a sort of retaining wall for the burial mound.\n\nBecause these \"haniwa\" display the contemporary clothing, hairstyle, farming tools, and architecture, these sculptures are important as a historical archive of the Kofun Period.\n\nEveryday pottery items from that period are called Haji pottery.\n\nEarlier clay figurines appeared during the Jōmon period called \"dogū\".\n\nHiroaki Sato cites a passage from the Nihon Shoki, in which Emperor Suinin issued an imperial edict concerning funerals: \"From now on make it a rule to erect clay figures and not to hurt people.\" Thus, these clay figures may have replaced live human sacrifices.\n\nThe origin of \"haniwa\" started during the latter part of the Yayoi period around the Kingdom of Kibi. During this time special earthenware figurines and bowls started to appear on top of the tombs of leaders. The early sculptures exceeded 1m (3.3ft) in length. They consisted of a cylindrical portion, which represented the torso, and a skirt-shaped portion at the base, which represented the legs. Many times a special insignia or pattern would be displayed on the torso. Sometimes an obi would be placed around the torso. These sculptures are thought to have been used as part of a funeral ritual. Other than the Kibi area, the only other place these sculptures were found was in the Izumo province.\n\nDuring the latter part of the 3rd century AD, these sculptures started to appear on top of the imperial grave mounds in the Kinai region. During this time more elaborate \"haniwa\" appeared with earthenware bowls. It is believed that the movement of these sculptures and \"haniwa\" from the Kibi region to the Kinai region is indicative of an increase in their importance.\n\nDuring the earlier part of the Kofun period (later 3rd century AD) the only earthenware \"haniwa\" were cylindrical; however, toward the early 4th century AD, shield and other tool-shaped \"haniwa\" started to appear. Additionally, during the middle Kofun period (mid-5th century AD) shrine maiden, horse, dog, and other animal-shaped \"haniwa\" were introduced. As the practice of ceremonial burial mounds declined in the mid-6th century AD, \"haniwa\" became rarer in the Kinai region; however, \"haniwa\" were made in abundance in the Kantō region.\n\nIt is not uncommon for some haniwa to be painted with red dye or other colors. Besides the cylindrical haniwa (enkei-haniwa), another common type was the house-shaped haniwa (keisho-haniwa). Other things that fell into the category of keisho-haniwa were those shaped like humans, animals, and swords. The details on the haniwa give information about the elite buried in the tomb, as well as valuable knowledge of the tools or other objects people of that time used. The military haniwa inform archeologists of the armour and weapons, as well as the status symbols of these military branches.\nOriginally, the cylindrical type \"haniwa\" were set on top of the funeral mounds, so it is believed that they had a purpose in funeral rituals; however, as the \"haniwa\" became more developed, they were set toward the outside of the grave area. It is thought that they were used as boundary markers for the borders of the gravesite.\n\nThere is a theory that the soul of the deceased would reside in the \"haniwa\", as the earlier \"haniwa\" were placed on top of the funeral mounds. There are \"haniwa\" that are equipped with weapons and armor. These are thought to be containers for souls. The armor and weapons would drive away evil spirits and protect the buried ruler from calamity. Because the horse- and animal-shaped \"haniwa\" were normally neatly arranged into a line, it is believed that they were part of a sending-off ceremony.\n\nAlthough the religious implications of the \"haniwa\" have largely declined in modern society, the sculptures are prized by many for their aesthetic and historical significance. The works of Shojiro Ishibashi, for example, were heavily influenced by the \"haniwa\". They have been accepted as \"Pure Art\", according to \"Time\" magazine. Beyond simple appreciation as artistic sculptures, modern popular culture has, in some cases, portrayed the \"haniwa\" as containing a sentient entity and not just as a simple empty sculpture. The most common portrayal depicts the \"haniwa\" with a rounded, pot-like shape, bearing two deep eyes, a wide mouth, and two featureless \"arms\" on opposite sides of the \"pot\".\n\nThe portrayal of living \"haniwa\" has—since the late 1990s—become widespread, being featured in trading cards, video games such as the \"Animal Crossing\", \"Dragon Quest\" and \"Kirby\" series; and television. In many of the depictions, the \"haniwa\" is primarily presented as a ghostlike, malevolent creature; without attempting to retain the historical aspect of the \"haniwa\"'s religious nature.\nIn \"Animal Crossing\", haniwas are called gyroids and are furniture only found buried in the ground.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4778099", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4778099", "title": "History of wound care", "text": "History of wound care\n\nThe history of wound care spans from prehistory to modern medicine. Wounds naturally heal by themselves, but hunter-gatherers would have noticed several factors and certain herbal remedies would speed up or assist the process, especially if it was grievous. In ancient history, this was followed by the realisation of the necessity of hygiene and the halting of bleeding, where wound dressing techniques and surgery developed. Eventually the germ theory of disease also assisted in improving wound care.\n\nOver time, different civilizations began to create their own herbal medicinal treatments for wounds depending on the trees, shrubs, or any other type of plants located in their environment. These herbal treatments became the oldest form of wound therapy. It is logically assumed that this may not have been a very safe way of treating humans with wounds due to overdosing or choosing the wrong plants to treat a person until the right one was found. Nevertheless, most of the ancient people who were given the duty of healers through the usage of herbs were well accustomed with which plants from their local flora could be used to help the injured. This knowledge was learned and passed down after healers repeatedly used an herbal remedy for a specific wound with the belief that it promoted healing.\n\nNumerous ancient herbal remedies and poisons now serve as models for modern medicine. For example, curare, which was an ancient South American arrow poison, was used in the 20th century as the muscle relaxant tubocurarine. Tribesmen conducted various observations on the effects of different plant parts, meaning roots, leaves, etc., on specific wounds. They also observed what seasons, time of day, or moon phase would result in a most active plant. The former however resulted in a minimal influence in modern medicine as compared to plants parts or seasons of growth.\n\nAs tribal healers developed into doctors, it spurred on a primitive pharmaceutical industry that included traders who would travel overseas bringing herbs that would be used for specific wounds. Soon, like most industries, patients began to skip the doctors altogether and purchased the herbs directly from the traders who were also aware of the effects and quantities that should be taken while also informing their “patients” of them. These merchants that supplied people with herbs were known as \"rhizotomiki\", or gatherers of roots, in Ancient Greece. The earliest known list of herbs and remedies was probably written for these herbal merchants. The earliest known to men is the R\"hizotomika\" \"of Diocles of Carustius\", a student of Greek philosopher Aristotle. This book includes the author’s observation of the effects of the herbal medicine on specific parts of the human body. This then became the beginning of scientific research on herbal remedies on humans, which has been modified and significantly changed from modern wound remedies.\n\nThe Greeks also acknowledged the importance of wound closure, and were the first to differentiate between acute and chronic wounds, calling them \"fresh\" and \"non-healing\", respectively. Galen of Pergamum, a Greek surgeon who served Roman gladiators circa 120–201 A.D., made many contributions to the field of wound care. The most important was the acknowledgment of the importance of maintaining wound-site moisture to ensure successful closure of the wound.\n\nThe clinical history of the treatment of acute and chronic wounds can also trace its origins to ancient Egypt. The Ebers Papyrus, circa 1500 BC, details the use of lint, animal grease, and honey as topical treatments for wounds. The lint provided its natural absorbency, the animal grease provided a barrier to environmental pathogens, and the honey served as an antibiotic agent. The Brugsch Papyrus, circa 1200 BC, stated that the Egyptians believed that making sure a person's wound stayed closed would help their spirit not be invaded by evil spirits.\n\nThere were many known herbs, minerals, and products that could help treat and remedy a variety of specific wounds in the ancient world; the following is a list that shows a set of substances that each were used with its own method and technique in regards to assisting wounds.\n\nTurmeric is a well-known spice that is utilized in India for use in cooking and medical treatments. The implementation of Turmeric in medical administration can typically be explained by the factor that Curcumin is a component that is contained within Turmeric. Curcumin is an antioxidant that assists in reducing the pain and effect that is caused by inflammation, and furthermore, is found to accelerate the process of wound healing. In the historical times around some areas of India, the people who would practice this treatment would begin by applying a healthy amount of Turmeric paste onto the wounded area, followed by a wrapping of clothes around the area; in many tribal locations this treatment is still performed.\n\nAnemia is a disease that is caused by a deficiency of iron, where an individual doesn’t contain enough red-blood cells to transport sufficient oxygen to the exterior body organs, otherwise known as tissues. Thus, with the surplus of iron in additives such as, tablets, pills, and vegetables, the effects of such a disease can be hindered or even prevented. Furthermore, in relation to wounds, it is often recommended by many doctors and surgeons that patients are encouraged to intake food and medicine that are high in iron to accelerate wound healing.\n\nHoney was utilized for its antibacterial properties that helped heal infected wounds. Moreover, honey was used as a topical ointment. Other than glucose, which is another name for sugar, honey also contains a variety of trace amounts of many different vitamins and amino acids, which are also known as proteins. The method used with honey, in regards to assisting medical treatments, mainly wounds, is by pouring and plastering a wholesome amount of it on the area of the wound. This technique will support in the reduction of pain, inflammation, and swelling. Furthermore, the antibacterial features that honey contains also constrain the wound from infection and growth.\n\nVarious types of alcohol were also used in ancient medical practices. One of the first uses was by the Sumerians, who used beer as an antiseptic along with the dressing of wounds, using up to 19 different types of beer. Other Ancient Arabic cultures, including the Sumerians and Akkadians used wine with sesame infusions, which were \"purified and pulverized\" before application along with the many beers. Another peoples to take advantage of the cleansing properties of alcohol were the Greeks. They used wine along with boiled water and vinegar to cleanse wounds. The Greeks, specifically Hippocrates (430-377 bc), were also the first to establish the four cardinal signs of inflammation: redness, swelling, heat and pain. Alcohol is still in use today as a wound cleanser largely as rubbing alcohol. However the side effects can be skin cell death resulting in inflammation and itchiness at the site of application.\n\nThere were limited advances that continued throughout the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, but the most profound advances, both technological and clinical, came with the development of microbiology and cellular pathology in the 19th century.\n\nThe first advances in wound care in this era began with the work of Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician who discovered how hand washing and cleanliness in general in medical procedures prevents maternal deaths. Semmelweis's work was furthered by an English surgeon, Joseph Lister, who in 1860s began treating his surgical gauze with carbolic acid, known today as phenol, and subsequently dropped his surgical team's mortality rate by 45%. Building on the success of Lister's pretreated surgical gauze, Robert Wood Johnson I, co-founder of Johnson & Johnson, began in the 1890s producing gauze and wound dressings sterilized with dry heat, steam, and pressure. These innovations in wound-site dressings marked the first major steps forward in the field since the advances of the Egyptians and Greeks centuries earlier. In 1886, Ernst von Bergmann introduced heat sterilization of surgical instruments, which marked the beginning of aseptic surgery and significantly reduced the frequency of infections. Conrad Brunner did extensive research into wound management and experimentation with wound disinfection methods, publishing his comprehensive \"Erfahrungen und Studien über Wundinfektion und Wundbehandlung\" in 1898. That same year, Paul Leopold Friedrich introduced wound excision and experimentally showed that excision of open wounds substantially reduced the risk of infection. The next advances would arise from the development of polymer synthetics for wound dressings and the \"rediscovery\" of moist wound-site care protocols in the mid 20th century.\n\nDuring World War I, chemist Henry Drysdale Dakin was consulted and invented Dakin's Solution, sodium hypochlorate and boric acid, to wash out the traumatic wounds of British soldiers fighting in France.\n\nThe advent in the 1950s of fibrous synthetics such as nylon, polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyls provided new materials from which researchers and doctors in the field of wound care could explore better protecting of healing wounds and even accelerating the natural wound healing process.\n\nIn the 1960s, research and articles by George Winter and Howard Maibach reported on the superior efficacy of moist wound dressings. The adoption of moist wound dressing technique as recommended best wound dressing practice reflected a large advance in approach producing markedly superior clinical outcomes. This dawn of modern wound care treatment initiated a process of improvement in the clinician's ability to bolster wound-site re-epithelialization and healing. The focus on evidence-based best practices and research continues.\n\nIn the 1990s, improvements in composite and hybrid polymers expanded the range of materials available for wound dressing. Grafting and biotechnology have produced usable and useful protective covering of actual human skin generated through cloning procedures. These improvements, coupled with the developments in tissue engineering, have given rise to a number of new classes of wound dressings. One of these, \"living skin equivalents, \" is often cited as a misnomer because they lack key components of whole living skin. \"Living skin equivalents\" may have the potential to serve as cellular platforms for the release of growth factors essential for proper wound healing. Many biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds have been developed to facilitate wound healing through various mechanisms.\n\nOther recent developments has been the renewed focus on the prominent patient concern of pain. Burn patients and others affected by severe wounds often report pain as the dominant negative impact of the wounds on their lives. Clinical management of the pain associated with chronic wounds has been an emergency wound treatment priority and is now viewed as an integral part of treatment.\n\nIn modern-day 21st century, medicine has evolved to involve past treatments such as leech therapy, as well as advancing wound prevention and the treatment. A large part of wound care is wound treatment. This involves promoting healing, preventing infections, and getting rid of an already existent infection. Deciding on a treatment depends on the type of wound that a person has sustained. Varying from infections to burns, wound care is a priority in saving the limb, extremity, or life of a person. In a hospital or medical care setting, more severe wounds like diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers, and burns require sterile or clean (depending on the severity of the wound) dressings and wound care. The types of wound dressing include: dry dressings, wet-to-dry dressings, chemical-impregnated dressings, foam dressings, alginate dressings, hydrofiber dressings, transparent film dressings, hydrogel dressings, and hydrocolloid dressings. All of the listed dressing types require different materials to complete the dressing.\n\n\nMedical leeches were cleared as a medical device in 2004 after being an indispensable tool in the 19th century. This unique use of creatures is utilized in many surgeries today. Leeches have the ability to assist with compromised tissue with the components of their saliva. Their saliva contains a local anesthetic, thrombin inhibitor, antibiotic properties and a histamine-like vasodilator. These capabilities help in surgeries such as transplants, skin grafts, and even reconstructive surgeries. The leeches help localize the wound and help produce blood flow. This is helpful in operations where blood clots occur and they help dilate the blood vessels.\n\nMedical maggots were first utilized by military medical aids during World War 2. They worked as biomedical debriding agents by ingesting bacteria and break them down within their intestines. Maggots give off an enzyme that disinfects wounds and promotes healing and this is why they became the first organism in the United States that were used as a medical device in January 2004.\n\n\n\n"}

Baker Jr.\n\nHouston Alfred Baker Jr. (born March 22, 1943) is an American scholar specializing in African-American literature and currently serving as a professor at Vanderbilt University in the English department.\n\nBaker served as president of the Modern Language Association, editor of the journal \"American Literature\", and has authored several books, including \"The Journey Back: Issues in Black Literature and Criticism\", \"Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance\", \"Blues, Ideology, and Afro-American Literature\", and \"Workings of the Spirit: The Poetics of Afro-American Women's Writing\". Baker was included in the 2006 textbook \"Fifty Key Literary Theorists\", by Richard J. Lane.\n\nBaker was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, a city he later described as \"racist\" and \"stultifying\". The racism and violence he claims to have experienced as a youth would later prompt him to conclude \"I had been discriminated against and called 'Nigger' enough to think that what America needed was a good Black Revolution.\" He recently revised that judgment in his book combining memoir and critique titled \"I Don't Hate the South\" (Oxford University Press, 2007).\n\nBaker's academic career initially progressed along traditional lines. He earned a B.A. in English literature from Howard University and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Victorian literature from the UCLA. He began teaching at Yale University and intended to write a biography of Oscar Wilde. In 1970 he joined the University of Virginia's Center for Advanced Studies, and from 1974-77 he directed the University of Pennsylvania's Afro-American Studies Program.\n\nFrom 1977-99, Baker was a Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania. Starting in 1982, he was the Albert M. Greenfield Professor of Human Relations, and in 1987 he also founded the university's Center for the Study of Black Literature and Culture, serving as the Center's director until 1999.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2006, Baker was the Susan Fox and George D. Beischer Professor of English and editor of \"American Literature\" at Duke University. In 2006, he became a Distinguished University Professor at Vanderbilt University.\n\nBaker's work in African American literary studies has been called \"groundbreaking\" for his ability to connect theory about the texts with the historical conditions of the beginning of the African American community, namely, both their uprooting from Africa and their ability to maintain their African heritage through an emphasis on spirituality and on autobiography, which allowed them to \"reinforce and reinvent self-worth in the midst of their debasement\". His work in the 1970s focused on locating and mapping the origins of the \"black aesthetic\", such as found in the Black Arts Movement and the attendant development of anthologies, journals and monographs about African-American literature.\n\nBaker's breakthrough work was 1980's \"The Journey Back: Issues in Black Literature and Criticism\", in which he critiques earlier discussions of the black aesthetic and calls for an interdisciplinary approach that would focus on the context of the literary works, which he claims are always \"in motion\".\n\nBaker argues that the attempts to forge a black aesthetic in the 1960s were not simply descriptive, but actively creative and thus based on—and distorted by—the writers' idealism. Baker offers history as a corrective, arguing that the black community has always created art forms in the face of oppression and that black artists need to \"journey back\" in order to \"re-affirm the richness and complexity\" of black aesthetic history and to recuperate lost aesthetic forms.\n\nBaker used this approach in his 1987 study, \"Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance\", in which he takes black critics to task for accepting the common notion that the Harlem Renaissance was a failure and then shows how notions of modernism based on European and Angloamerican texts are \"inappropriate for understanding Afro-American modernism\". He argues that by examining the literature of the Harlem Renaissance in conversation with contemporaneous developments in African American music, art and philosophy, we can identify the development of \"new modes of production\" that lead to a rebirth; Baker calls these modes \"blues geographies\". Baker points to Booker T. Washington's 1895 Exposition address as the beginning of African American modernist concerns, in that Washington both adopted and subverted a minstrel mask, thus creating a post-slavery African American trope that is both useful and restrictive.\n\nIn \"Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance\", Baker argued for the importance of oral culture in the black aesthetic tradition, an idea he develops in his work on African American feminists in the essay \"There Is No More Beautiful Way: Theory and the Poetics of Afro-American Women's Writing\", which stresses the connection between oral culture and autobiography.\n\nBaker's 1984 \"Blues, Ideology, and Afro-American Literature: A Vernacular Theory\" had also developed his ideas about blues geographies and about orality, but had joined these ideas with developments in post-structuralism, borrowing from the work of Hegel and Derrida to argue that blues music is a \"matrix\", a code that acts as the foundation for African American artistic production insofar as blues music synthesizes numerous types of early African American oral genres; he develops this notion of \"blues geography\" through his reading of key works by Frederick Douglass, Zora Neale Hurston, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Amiri Baraka, and Toni Morrison.\n\nIn his analysis of Baker's contributions, Richard J. Lane claims that Baker's ability to connect literary theory with vernacular literature and to keep that combination connected to the material conditions of black life in the USA \"provides a pedagogical model for [...] new ways of reading literature in general\".\n\nHolding \"an exceedingly pessimistic view of American social progress where race is concerned,\" Baker has written many books on African Americans in modern American society. In \"Turning South Again: Rethinking Modernism/Rereading Booker T\", Baker suggests being a black American, even a successful one, amounts to a kind of prison sentence.\n\nBaker also harshly criticized President Barack Obama's widely praised race-centered speech (\"A More Perfect Union\") stemming from controversial remarks given by his pastor: \"Sen. Obama's 'race speech' at the National Constitution Center, draped in American flags, was reminiscent of the Parthenon concluding scene of Robert Altman's \"Nashville\": a bizarre moment of mimicry, aping Martin Luther King Jr., while even further distancing himself from the real, economic, religious and political issues so courageously articulated by King from a Birmingham jail. In brief, Obama's speech was a pandering disaster that threw, once again, his pastor under the bus.\"\n\nDuring the 2006 Duke University lacrosse case, Baker published an open letter calling for Duke to dismiss the team and its players. Baker claimed that \"white, male, athletic privilege\" was responsible for the alleged rape. Baker suggested that the Duke administration was \"sweeping things under the rug.\" More generally, Baker's letter criticized colleges and universities for the \"blind-eyeing of male athletes, veritably given license to rape, maraud, deploy hate speech, and feel proud of themselves in the bargain.\"\n\nDuke Provost Peter Lange responded to Baker's letter a few days later, criticizing Baker for prejudging the team based on their race and gender, citing this as a classic tactic of racism. Lange, the longest-serving provost in Duke's history, stepped down in 2013.\n\nIn 2007, charges against the players were dropped and the state's Attorney General took the extraordinary step of declaring the students innocent.\n\nFollowing the exoneration of the players, one of the parents of a Duke lacrosse player emailed Baker and reported that he responded by writing that she was \"quite sadly, mother of a 'farm animal'\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52335", "title": "Idiolect", "text": "Idiolect\n\nIdiolect is an individual's distinctive and unique use of language, including speech. This unique usage encompasses vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation. \n\nIdiolect is the variety of language unique to an individual. This differs from a dialect, a common set of linguistic characteristics shared among some group of people.\n\nThe term idiolect refers to the language of an individual. It is etymologically related to the Greek prefix \"idio-\" (meaning \"own, personal, private, peculiar, separate, distinct\") and a back-formation of \"dialect\".\n\nThe notion of \"language\" is used as an abstract description of the \"language use\", and of the abilities of individual speakers and listeners. According to this view, a language is an \"ensemble of idiolects ... rather than an entity per se\". Linguists study particular languages, such as English or Xhosa, by examining the utterances produced by the people who speak the language.\n\nThis contrasts with a view among non-linguists, at least in the United States, that languages as ideal systems exist outside the actual practice of language users: Based on work done in the US, Nancy Niedzielski and Dennis Preston describe a language ideology that appears to be common among American English speakers. According to Niedzielski and Preston, many of their subjects believe that there is one \"correct\" pattern of grammar and vocabulary that underlies Standard English, and that individual usage comes from this external system.\n\nLinguists who understand particular languages as a composite of unique, individual idiolects must nonetheless account for the fact that members of large speech communities, and even speakers of different dialects of the same language, can understand one another. All human beings seem to produce language in essentially the same way. This has led to searches for universal grammar, as well as attempts to further define the nature of particular languages.\n\nThe scope of forensic linguistics includes attempts to identify whether a certain person did or did not produce a given text by comparing the style of the text with the idiolect of the individual. The forensic linguist may conclude that the text is consistent with the individual, rule out the individual as the author, or deem the comparison inconclusive.\n\nIn 1995 Max Appedole relied in part on an analysis of Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente's writing style to identify him as Subcomandante Marcos, a leader of the Zapatista movement. Though the Mexican government regarded Subcomandante Marcos as a dangerous guerilla, Appedole convinced them that Guillén was a pacifist. These events are credited as an early success of forensic linguistics in criminal profiling in law enforcement.\n\nIn 1998 Ted Kaczynski was convicted of a series of bombings known as the \"Unabomber\" case. FBI profilers identified a number of linguistic idiosyncrasies in an essay published by the Unabomber, which led them to conclude that Kaczynski was the author.\n\n\n"}

It was first published in October 2007 by HarperOne, an imprint of HarperCollins, and has also been marketed under its alternate subtitle \"The True Story of the Aruba Kidnapping and Its Aftermath\".\n\nHolloway said that she vowed to share her story shortly following her daughter's disappearance, in the hope that other families would not suffer what she had to go through. After five months of unsuccessfully searching on Aruba, her attorney John Q. Kelly took over the case and she spent the next two years traveling to various high schools and colleges to present messages about personal safety. When she thought about reaching more travelers with her story, Holloway said that her efforts evolved into writing a book.\n\nThe book retells events leading up to the night Natalee Holloway disappeared during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005, and the ensuing investigation in the aftermath. It then focuses on the obstacles faced by the Holloway-Twitty family in their search for Natalee's whereabouts. Holloway recounts her anger at what she felt was a lack of cooperation from local authorities such as the Aruba Police Force, including the failure to obtain a warrant to search the home of suspect Joran van der Sloot.\n\nThe first hardcover edition and e-book were published on October 2, 2007. A paperback edition was published on April 28, 2009, under the alternate title \"Loving Natalee: The True Story of the Aruba Kidnapping and Its Aftermath\" and includes additional material. The hardcover and paperback versions both contain 256 pages. A Dutch language version, titled \"Lieve Natalee: het ware verhaal over Natalee Holloway\", was released in March 2008 by Schuyt & Co.\n\nExcerpts from the book were previewed in \"Good Housekeeping\" magazine. It was later promoted during an interview with Holloway on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Soon after its initial release in October 2007, the book was on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list.\n\nDennis Lythgoe of \"Deseret News\", noting that the book was ghostwritten, remarked that it was \"not very well-written\", but complimented it as \"a compelling glimpse of this mother's electric personality.\"\n\nIn October 2008, the Lifetime Movie Network announced plans to create a television film title based on the book. The senior vice president of original movies, Tanya Lopez, stated in the announcement that the network was \"pleased to be working closely with Natalee's mother\" and that they intended to tell the story of Holloway's disappearance \"sensitively and accurately.\" Jarett Wieselman of the \"New York Post\" questioned whether it was too soon for such a film to be made.\n\nThe April 19, 2009 broadcast of \"Natalee Holloway\" attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest television ratings in the network's 11-year history. Although it set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie was not received well by critic Alec Harvey of \"The Birmingham News\". Harvey called the movie \"sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months\". However, Jake Meaney of \"PopMatters\" found the film to be surprisingly \"calm and levelheaded\", and praised Tracy Pollan's portrayal of Holloway's mother. Joran van der Sloot himself watched the film one evening in 2010, according to his friend John Ludwick, and said that some parts were true while others were not.\n\n\n"}

The 18th-century connoisseur Johann Joachim Winckelmann, a man with a practiced eye for male beauty, found the Ludovisi Ares the most beautiful Mars that had been preserved from Antiquity, when he wrote the catalogue of the .\n\nRediscovered in 1622, the sculpture was apparently originally part of the temple of Mars (founded in 132 BCE in the southern part of the Campus Martius), of which few traces remain, for it was recovered near the site of the church of San Salvatore in Campo. Pietro Santi Bartoli recorded in his notes that it had been found near the Palazzo Santa Croce in Rione Campitelli during the digging of a drain. (Haskell and Penny 1981:260) The sculpture found its way into the collection formed by Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi (1595–1632) the nephew of Pope Gregory XV at the splendid villa and gardens he built near Porta Pinciana, on the site where Julius Caesar and his heir, Octavian (Caesar Augustus), had had their villa. The sculpture was lightly restored by the young Bernini, who refinished its surfaces and discreetly provided a right foot; he was probably largely responsible for the cupid, which Haskell and Penny note was omitted from G.F. Susini's bronze replica and from the prints of the sculpture in Maffei's anthology. \n\nThe sculpture was a sensational find. A small-scale bronze replica of it was executed by G.F. Susini, heir and assistant to his more famous uncle Antonio Susini, when he visited Rome in the 1630s and copied several marbles from Ludovisi's collection; a bronze of the Ludovisi Ares is in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. Later, the Ludovisi Ares was one of the featured antiquities to be seen on the \"grand tour\". For example, the portrait of English tourist John Talbot (later first Earl Talbot) by Pompeo Batoni depicts him next to the statue to display his culture and showing his familiarity with great works of art. Less expensive representations could be found: Giambattista Piranesi's son Francesco made an engraving of it at the Villa Ludovisi in 1783 . Casts of the Ludovisi Ares found their way into early museum collections, such as the Copenhagen Glyptotek and were influential to several generations of Neoclassical and academic students.\n\nIn 1901, the eventual heir, prince Boncompagni-Ludovisi, brought the Ludovisi antiquities to auction. The Italian state purchased 96 of the objects, and the rest have been dispersed among the museums of Europe and the US. The Ares is conserved in the section of the National Museum of the Terme that is housed in Palazzo Altemps, Rome.\n\nA depiction of the statue is used as an emblem for the Greek athletic club Aris Thessaloniki.\n\n\n"}

As a discipline it makes use of data from psychology, sociology, philosophy, and history to account for such phenomena as aggressive war, ethnic cleansing, genocide, and despotism.\n\nDuring World War II, Łobaczewski worked for the Polish Home Army, an underground Polish resistance organization. After the war, he studied at Jagiellonian University under professor of psychiatry Edward Brzezicki. Łobaczewski's class was the last to receive an education uninfluenced by Soviet ideology and censorship, after which psychiatry was restricted to Pavlovian concepts. The study of genetics and psychopathy was forbidden.\n\nThe original theory and research was conducted by a research group of psychologists and psychiatrists from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and pre-communist Hungary. The group was brought together by Łobaczewski and included Kazimierz Dąbrowski, Stefan Szuman, and Stefan Błachowski, and many other anonymous contributors.\n\nŁobaczewski adopted the term \"ponerology\", which is derived from the Greek word \"poneros\", from the branch of theology dealing with the study of evil. According to Łobaczewski, all societies vacillate between \"happy times\" and \"unhappy times\". During happy times, societies enjoy prosperity and suppress advanced psychological knowledge of psychopathological influence in the corridors of power. Though happy, these times are not necessarily morally advanced as the society's prosperity or happiness may be premised on the oppression of a target group. During unhappy times, the intelligentsia and society at large can recover this specialized knowledge to resolve the social order along mentally healthier lines.\n\nA form of government interesting to ponerologists is one they have called \"pathocracy\", in which individuals with personality disorders (especially psychopathy) occupy positions of power and influence. The result is a totalitarian system characterized by a government turned against its own people. A pathocracy may emerge when a society is insufficiently guarded against the typical and inevitable minority of such abnormal pathology, which Łobaczewski asserts is caused by biology or genetics. He argues that in such cases these individuals infiltrate an institution or state, prevailing moral values are perverted into their opposite, and a coded language like Orwell's doublethink circulates into the mainstream, using paralogic and paramoralism in place of genuine logic and morality.\n\nThere are various identifiable stages of pathocracy described by Łobaczewski. Ultimately, each pathocracy is foredoomed because the root of healthy social morality, according to Łobaczewski, is contained in the congenital instinctive infrastructure in the vast majority of the population. While some in the normal population are more susceptible to pathocratic influence, and become its lackeys, the majority instinctively resist.\n\n"}

The violence was even described as a \"low-level war\". The death squads of Turkish right-wing ultra-nationalist groups against left-wing opposition inflicted some 5,000 casualties. The wave of violence dimmed after the 1980 Turkish coup d'état.\n\nIn 1975 Süleyman Demirel, president of the conservative Justice Party (, AP) succeeded Bülent Ecevit, president of the social-democratic Republican People's Party (, CHP) as Prime Minister. He formed a coalition called \"the Nationalist Front ()\" with Necmettin Erbakan's Islamist National Salvation Party (, MSP), and Alparslan Türkeş' far right Nationalist Movement Party (, MHP). The MHP used the opportunity to infiltrate state security services, seriously aggravating the low-intensity war that was waging between rival factions.\n\nThe elections of 1977 had no winner. First, Demirel continued the coalition with the Nationalist Front, but in 1978, Ecevit was able to get to power again with the help of some deputies who had shifted from one party to another. In 1979, Demirel once again became Prime Minister. At the end of the 1970s, Turkey was in an unstable situation with unsolved economic and social problems facing strike actions and partial paralysis of politics (the Grand National Assembly of Turkey was unable to elect a President during the six months preceding the coup). Since 1968–69, a proportional representation system had made it difficult to find any parliamentary majority. The interests of the industrial bourgeoisie, which held the largest holdings of the country, were opposed by other social classes such as smaller industrialists, traders, rural notables, and landlords, whose interests did not always coincide among themselves. Numerous agricultural and industrial reforms requested by parts of the middle upper classes were blocked by others. Henceforth, the politicians seemed unable to combat the growing violence in the country.\n\nUnprecedented political violence had erupted in Turkey in the late 1970s. The overall death toll of the 1970s is estimated at 5,000, with nearly ten assassinations per day. Most were members of left-wing and right-wing political organizations, then engaged in bitter fighting. The ultra-nationalist Grey Wolves, youth organisation of the MHP, claimed they were supporting the security forces. According to the British \"Searchlight magazine\", in 1978 there were 3,319 fascist attacks, in which 831 were killed and 3,121 wounded. In the central trial against the left-wing organization Devrimci Yol (Revolutionary Path) at Ankara Military Court the defendants listed 5,388 political killings before the military coup. Among the victims were 1,296 right-wingers and 2,109 left-wingers. The others could not clearly be related. The 1978 Bahçelievler Massacre, the 1977 Taksim Square massacre with 35 victims and the 1978 Maraş massacre with over 100 victims are some notable incidents. Martial law was announced following the Kahramanmaraş Massacre in 14 of (then) 67 provinces in December 1978. At the time of the coup martial law had been extended to 20 provinces.\n\nEcevit was warned about the coming coup in June 1979 by Nuri Gündeş of the National Intelligence Organization (MİT). Ecevit then told his interior minister, İrfan Özaydınlı, who then told Sedat Celasun—one of the five generals who would lead the coup. The deputy undersecretary of the MİT, Nihat Yıldız, was demoted to the London consulate and replaced by a lieutenant general as a result.\n\nThe right-wing groups were opposed towards Kurdish separatism. Disproportionate numbers of Kurds were part of the left-wing groups. Most of the left was also Turkish nationalist and opposed towards separatism. Before the coup of 1980 only a minority of the violence was committed by separatists, after that it increased.\n\n"}

It enabled people to have a greater interaction with the political landscape, controversies, and news surrounding the candidates involved. Unlike traditional news platforms, such as newspapers, radio, and magazines, social media gave people the ability to share, comment, and post below a candidate's advertisement, news surrounding the candidates, or articles regarding the policy of the candidates. This accessibility, in turn, would have a great influence on the events that ultimately led to its outcome.\n\nCandidates would often use multiple social media accounts, such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat. Depending on the digital architecture of each platform, candidates would post, create support videos, link to news articles, and challenge other candidates via fact-checking, discrediting, and response. In turn, users could share, like, or comment on these actions, furthering the candidates outreach. By doing so, candidates and users both would influence or change peoples views on a specific issue. With candidates using different combinations of these actions, they built a unique style of communication with the public, influencing the portrayal of themselves in the news, and in their own accounts. These accounts then would help build electoral coalitions, which identify voters and, in turn, raise money. As a result, they ultimately aided in voter mobilization and electoral impact. Researchers from Stanford have found that 62% of U.S. adults get their news on social media and that people are more likely to believe in news favoring their choice of candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social networks\n\nThroughout the campaign, candidates have debated over immigrational, foreign, economic, healthcare, criminal, domestic, educational, environmental, and electoral policy. Using social media, they expanded their base further beyond the broadcast debates, both in the Republican and Democratic primary, and in the general election. In one instance, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton feuded over economic and educational policy in a series of tweets. In another, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump feuded over Obama's endorsement of Hillary Clinton, and the deletion of Twitter accounts. Overall, these and many other events on social media contributed to the outcome of the 2016 election by endorsement, controversy, or other exhibits providing discussion for political discourse.\n\nAs the campaign began, analysts assumed that, because of the increased reach and capacity of social media sites of all kinds since the last election cycle, social media would be used in potentially powerful new ways. \"The Wall Street Journal\" predicted that the use of campaign advertisements targeted at individuals using newly available data would be among the more notable innovations.\n\nThe political newspaper, \"The Hill\", concluded not only that \"[s]ocial media's influence in this presidential election is stronger than it has ever been,\" but that it \"will shape campaigns for years to come.\" According to \"The Wall Street Journal\", the \"traditional media\" and the Democratic and Republican parties have lost \"dominance\" of public opinion to the \"digital revolution.\"\n\nFrank Speiser, co-founder of SocialFlow, said, \"This is the first true social media election.\" He added that before the 2016 presidential primaries, social media were a mere \"auxiliary method of communication,\" but in this new era, \"folks on social media to act on your behalf by just sharing it around. You don't have to buy access to reach millions of people anymore.\" According to Republican political strategist Patrick Ruffini, in the 2012 election cycle, candidates would make short statements, and re-tweet or thank followers. The candidates were able to use social media to get free advertising from their supporters. Attendees of political rallies would take photos with the candidates that would then be shared on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. This generates more visibility for the candidate at no cost to them.\n\n\"The Guardian\" compared Internet memes to political cartoons, arguing, \"For the first time in a US election cycle, community-generated memes have grown to play a significant role in political discourse, similar to the classic printed cartoon.\" While an Internet meme is unlikely to destroy a political career, lots of memes targeting a candidate might.\n\nThe Trump presidential campaign benefited from large numbers of supporters who were active on social media from the beginning of the campaign.\nDonald Trump was perhaps one of the most provocative presidents in recent times, creating a strong divide within the country as there seemed to be very few people who felt only moderate feelings for him. With such a large divide created, it is no surprise that issues would arise on the Internet from both the supporters, who would call themselves \"Centipedes\" online and the liberals (who sometimes refer to each other as comrades online).\n\nIn the first Republican Presidential debate, held on August 6, 2015, the moderator asked candidate Jeb Bush if he stood by a statement made the previous April that illegal entry into the U.S. by undocumented migrants is \"an act of love.\" Bush replied that he did and the Trump campaign immediately posted his comment as part of a video showing mugshots of illegal immigrants who committed violent crimes in the US, alternating with footage of Bush saying, \"Yeah, they broke the law, but it's not a felony… It's an act of love.\" According to Eric Fehrnstrom, political analyst and media strategist, the video marked a crucial turning point in the campaign for the Republican nomination. Political analyst Michael Barone regarded the ad as a key moment in Trump's political rise. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" described the ad as pivotal in transforming Instagram from a personal photo-sharing app that some celebrities and politicians used to enhance their images, into a propaganda tool.\n\n\"The Great Meme War\" was an Internet campaign conducted by supporters of Donald Trump and opponents of Hillary Clinton between June 2015 and November 2016 in an effort to sway the election. During this time period users of social media, especially Reddit and 4chan, conducted numerous \"operations\" to sway public opinion using Internet memes, Internet posts and online media.\n\n\"Right Side Broadcasting Network\" frequently uploaded live streams of Donald Trump rallies on YouTube. As of September 2016, the channel has received over 210 thousand subscribers, exceeding the subscribers of MSNBC's YouTube channel.\n\nOn Reddit, /r/The Donald is a pro-Trump subforum (termed a \"subreddit\" on Reddit) which ranks consistently as the most active on the site. Due to the very active community that outpaced the rest of the website, the algorithm that dictated what content reached the \"/r/all\" page of the website resulted in the significant portion of the page being /r/The_Donald content. In response, Reddit made changes to its algorithms on June 15 in an attempt to preserve variety of /r/all. On July 27, 2016, Trump participated in an Ask Me Anything (AMA) on /r/The_Donald, answering thirteen questions from his supporters. /r/The_Donald is more active and has a higher subscriber count than the subreddit for Hillary Clinton, /r/HillaryClinton.\n\nTrump has become well-documented in his frequent Twitter posts. With social media acting as free media and publicity, Trump harnessed Twitter as a platform to respond quickly to his opponents and tweet about his stance on various issues. Before the Republican National Convention where Trump was named the Republican candidate, he would relentlessly target his fellow Republican candidates when their poll numbers would rise. President-elect Donald Trump utilized Twitter frequently both during and after the 2016 presidential election, explaining that social media helped him win the primary and general elections even though his opponents spent \"much more money than [he] spent\". While Slate explains that Trump succeeded because he retained his \"vulgar vigor and translated it into the political arena\", the \"Washington Post\" has called his Twitter account \"prolific, populist, and self-obsessed\".\n\nIn April 2016, Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton super PAC, announced a program called \"Barrier Breakers\" intended to rival the largely online volunteer efforts of Sanders and Trump supporters. With $1 million in funding, Correct the Record employed paid staff described as \"former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers\" to post \"exclusively positive content\".\n\nOn June 9, 2016, as a response to Donald Trump's tweet regarding Obama's endorsement to Clinton, she wrote with a three-word tweet: \"Delete your account\"; it became her most retweeted tweet of all time. After the Democratic National Convention, Clinton began campaigning with running mate, Tim Kaine, and while on the campaign trail, she stated, \"I don't know who created \"Pokémon Go\"...I try to get them to have \"Pokémon Go\" to the polls\".\n\nClinton began using social media platform Snapchat to chronicle her campaign across America. One of her videos, where she proclaimed that she was, \"Just chillin', in Cedar Rapids\", quickly became a meme on video-sharing app Vine.\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", Cruz was \"skewered by social media memes\". His run for the Presidency was ended by a series of memes, including a viral video of an unusually awkward attempt to shake hands with his running mate Carly Fiorina, which was edited to emphasize his awkwardness in reality. The video was viewed 3.5 million times online. In addition, a mock-conspiracy theory faux-asserted that Cruz was actually the Zodiac Killer, an unidentified serial killer active in northern California from the late 1960s to the early 1970s.\n\nSocial media is widely acknowledged to have played a crucial role in the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign. As of May 2016, 450,000 people belong to the Facebook group Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash, one of the several online groups supporting Sanders. Memes were used as the primary means of starting conversational topics in groups such as Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash and Bernie Sanders is my HERO, which were primarily devoted to debating & educating, and praising Bernie whilst pointing out flaws in rival candidates Ted Cruz, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton in comical ways. Another group, Bernie or Hillary?, dedicated to creating mock-campaign posters comparing Sanders to Clinton. Sanders supporters who succeeded in closing down a planned Trump rally in Chicago in March 2016 were organized via Facebook.\n\n\"Bernie or Hillary?\" (or \"Bernie vs. Hillary\"\n) was an Internet meme made popular during the 2016 Democratic Party presidential nomination in the United States 2016 election, in which Internet users who mostly favored Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton compared the two candidates in faux political posters.\n\nThe humorous Balanced Rebellion video in which \"Dead Abe Lincoln\" endorses Johnson has been the most widely viewed viral video of any candidate the 2016 campaign. The advertisement shows the many negative aspects of both Hillary and Trump, and states that Johnson will protect our freedoms. Another video that made headlines shows the former New Mexico governor faking a heart attack during a debate on the legalization of marijuana. Johnson also received a 5,000 percent increase in Google searches when Ted Cruz dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination. As a third party candidate, one of Johnson's main focuses was to convince dissatisfied Republicans and Democrats to vote for him. One way to attract more voters was to go to the Democratic National Convention to persuade disheartened Bernie Sanders supporters to vote for him. This method proved to be somewhat effective as Johnson had a surge in online interactions about the former Governor during the two days of the convention, July 26 and 27.\n\nJill Stein made extensive use of Twitter for her presidential campaign. She used the social media platform to communicate with Americans before, during, and after the presidential debate at Hofstra University. Stein used her Twitter influence in hopes that it would demonstrate a \"changing political landscape\" where voters weren't only faced with two options for president. Stein was trending for the first time on Twitter the week of July 20, 2016 and gained 27,000 new followers. Stein also had the same idea as Gary Johnson to sway discouraged Bernie Sanders supporters to vote for her in the election. This led to a boost in online conversation about Stein during the DNC, just as it did with Johnson. After the end of the election, Stein requested a recount in Wisconsin. She used her social media influence to raise millions of dollars for recounts in not only Wisconsin, but also Pennsylvania and Michigan. Stein stated that the reason for the recount was to assure that no hacking of voting machines or voter results occurred.\n\n"}

It is arguably the most influential journal of Black Studies and central to the very emergence of that field. After being renewed and reinvigorated in 2010, it has continued its influence. In 2017, \"The Princeton Review of Academic Journals\" ranked it the number-one journal of Black Studies in the United States. Its associated Black Scholar Press has published books since the 1970s.  The journal is currently housed at Boston University's Program in African American Studies.\n\n\"The Black Scholar\"'s Editor-in-Chief is the scholar and writer Louis Chude-Sokei, author of works including \"The Last Darky: Bert Williams, Black on Black Minstrelsy and the African Diaspora\" (Duke University Press, 2005) and \"The Sound of Culture: Diaspora and Black Technopoetics\"  (Wesleyan University Press, 2015).  Its Senior Editor is Shireen K. Lewis, author of \"Race, Culture, and Identity: Francophone West African and Caribbean Literature and Theory from Negritude to Creolite\" (Lexington Books, 2001), and founder/director of SisterMentors, a notable non-profit in Washington DC. Additionally, historian Jonathan Fenderson serves as Associate Editor, and Shannon Hanks-Mackey is the Managing Editor. Of all Black journals in the U.S., only the NAACP’s \"The Crisis\" (founded in 1910) and the \"Journal of African American History\" (formerly \"The Journal of Negro History\", founded in 1916) have been publishing for a longer period of time. \"TBS\" is owned by the Robert Chrisman Foundation, a Seattle, Washington-based non-profit educational organization, and is published quarterly by Routledge/Taylor & Francis.\n\nRobert Chrisman (1937–2013) and Nathan Hare (b. 1933) were active in the 1968 Black and ethnic studies battles at San Francisco State University. Hare had been hired to coordinate a Black Studies program, the first in the United States, and to write a proposal for a department of Black studies, which Black students wanted to have as a fully independent department. As a consequence of a five-month student-faculty strike, the first and the longest strike for Black studies in the US academy, Hare, who was arrested twice for activities during the strike, was fired and Chrisman was removed as a professor from tenure track. The strike experience motivated Chrisman and Hare to create a venue outside of the academy for Black knowledge production.\n\nIn November 1969, Hare (publisher), Chrisman (editor) and Allan Ross, a white Bay Area printer (as business manager) founded \"The Black Scholar: A Journal of Black Studies and Research\" to cover issues of social, cultural, economic and political thought. Its opening issue, \"The Culture of Revolution\", featured articles by Eldridge Cleaver, Amiri Baraka, Sékou Touré, and Stokely Carmichael, among others, with Nathan Hare writing the lead article on the First Pan African Cultural Festival Cultural Festival held in Algiers in the summer. There he obtained articles from African intellectuals such as Sékou Touré, as well as Eldridge Clever and his rival, Stokely Carmichael, both of whom had just expatriated to Africa.\n\nEarly members of the editorial and advisory board included Shirley Chisholm, Imamu Baraka, Angela Davis, Sonia Sanchez, Chuck Stone, Dempsey Travis, Max Roach, John Oliver Killens, Ossie Davis, Shirley Graham Du Bois, Ron Karenga, and Lerone Bennett. Robert L. Allen (b. 1942) joined the journal as Associate Editor in 1974, then rose to Senior Editor (during the shakeup surrounding Nathan Hare's departure and Robert Chrisman's move to the position of Publisher, later Editor and Publisher), while Robert Allen remained Senior Editor until his retirement in 2012.\n\nNathan Hare left \"The Black Scholar\" in 1975 during an ideological dispute. In his open letter of resignation, Hare accused other board members of conspiring to further a Black Marxist agenda at the expense of competing ideologies. Writing of Hare's resignation, \"The New York Times\" called \"The Black Scholar\" the most important Black journal since \"The Crisis\" magazine of W. E. B. DuBois. Allan Ross had left a year or so earlier, but Hare declined his entreaties to leave with him. Robert Allen was brought in to replace Ross on the Board but in the position of Associate Editor, with Ross's assistant (Gloria Bevien) taking his place as Business Manager. Allan Ross died in 1974. Then Hare left in the spring of 1975.\n\nThe public split attracted coverage from national newspapers. \"The New York Times\" covered the story in an article titled \"Ideology Dispute Shakes Black Journal\", while the \"New York Amsterdam News\" headline read \"Black Reds Take Over Black Scholar!\"\n\n\"The Black Scholar\" published a special issue entitled \"The Black Sexism Debate\" (Vol. 10, No. 8/9, May/June 1979); this was one of the first public scholarly forums about sexism within the African-American community and it generated controversy due to contradictory positions on gender equality. The issue featured responses from feminists, intellectuals, and artists to Robert Staples’ controversial essay, “The Myth of the Black Macho: A Response to Angry Black Feminists,” which had been published in the previous issue of \"TBS.\" Staples had criticized the work of Michele Wallace and Ntozake Shange. The editors of the journal viewed the issue as a means of clarifying the relationship between Black men and women while forging solidarities among them.\n\nOver a decade later, when millions of people were fascinated by Clarence Thomas’ hearings in the Senate prior to his being confirmed to the Supreme Court, \"TBS\" compiled a special issue. Scholars and historians commented on the issues of sexism and racism in the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill controversy (Vol. 22, No. 1/2, Winter 1991–Spring 1992). The essays were later published as \"Court of Appeal: The Black Community Speaks Out on the Racial and Sexual Politics of Thomas vs. Hill\" (1992).\n\nMost recently, the journal has published a variety of notable special issues, which have begun to participate in the reshaping of Black Studies in the wake of new generations of institutional Black academics as well as in the wake of new political activism and cultural conversation around race, power, knowledge, and politics.  Examples include the award-winning issue on Dominican Black Studies (Vol. 45, No. 2, Summer 2015); a roundtable on the ABC television drama \"Scandal\" (Vol. 45, No. 1. Spring 2015); States of Black Studies (Vol. 44, No. 2, Summer 2014); and The Role of Black Philosophy (Vol. 43, No. 4, Winter 2013).  Also, there have been cutting edge issues focused on race and environmental justice (Fall 2016); technology such as Black Code (Fall 2017); Black Studies in South Africa (Summer 2017) and Black Experimental Poetics (Spring 2017).\n\n\"TBS\" has also focused on debates around sex and sexuality in the Black world, for example, with a wildly popular roundtable on \"Race, Pornography and Desire\" (Winter 2016) and with upcoming issues on Black Masculinity and the first collection of writings by and about Black Queer and Trans issues and aesthetics (forthcoming in 2019).\n\nThe journal has always explored Black American issues through a broader context of Black transnational experiences, and through an explicit global/pan-African lens. In 1977, for example, \"TBS\" published a special issue on Cuba, featuring essays from artists, activists, and intellectuals who had been enabled to visit Cuba through the initiative of the journal’s board. It has also devoted issues to South Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and addresses issues from all points of the Black world.\n\n\"The Black Scholar\" was founded on the principle that all Black authors, scholars, and activists could take part in dialogues within its pages. It has been dedicated to finding and developing new talent while also continuing to publish established authors. \"TBS\" has retained its non-discriminatory policy of publishing intellectuals from a variety of professions outside of academia. For example, \"TBS\" has featured articles by US Congress representatives Shirley Chisholm, Ron Dellums, Barbara Lee, and activists such as Julian Bond, Herb Boyd, Amílcar Cabral, Eldridge Cleaver, Nawal El Saadawi, Cheddi Jagan, Julius Nyerere, Bobby Seale, and Kwame Ture (Stokely Carmichael).\n\nThe journal has regularly showcased creative writers from across the Black world. Opal Palmer Adisa, Margaret Walker Alexander, Amiri Baraka, Dennis Brutus, Frank M. Chipasula, Wanda Coleman, Jayne Cortez, René Depestre, Ernest J. Gaines, Nicolás Guillén, June Jordan, Jackie Kay, Yusef Komunyakaa, Audre Lorde, Nancy Morejón, Agostinho Neto, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, May Opitz, Ishmael Reed, Andrew Salkey, Sonia Sanchez, Ntozake Shange, Wole Soyinka and Alice Walker have been published in issues of \"TBS\" over the years.\n\nThe journal has promoted a wide ideological spectrum of Black scholarly and artistic talent including Derrick Bell, Horace Campbell, Clayborne Carson, Elizabeth Catlett, John Henrik Clarke, Darlene Clark Hine, Johnnetta B. Cole, Carolyn Cooper, St. Clair Drake, Katherine Dunham, E. Chukwudi Eze, Kevin Gaines, Henry Louis Gates Jr., Lewis R. Gordon, Farah Jasmine Griffin, Beverly Guy-Sheftall, Patricia Hill Collins, Joy James, E. Patrick Johnson, Peniel Joseph, Thabiti Asukile, Kara Keeling, Robin D. G. Kelley, Treva B. Lindsey, Julianne Malveaux, Manning Marable, J. Lorand Matory, Tavia Nyong'o, Adolph Reed, Christina Sharpe, Barbara Smith, Hortense Spillers, Catherine Squires, Chuck Stone, and Ronald Walters.\n\nFurthermore, \"TBS\" has been recognized for its timely and significant interviews, such as the now famous dialogues with Muhammad Ali, Maya Angelou, Arthur Ashe, James Baldwin, Octavia Butler, Alex Haley, Darcus Howe, C. L. R. James, Jacob Lawrence, Queen Mother Audley Moore, Jack O’Dell, Walter Rodney, McCoy Tyner, George Yancy, and Robert F. Williams.\n\nThe journal has been home to celebrated essays from activists and academics alike. Angela Davis’s now canonized essay \"Reflections on the Black Woman's Role in the Community of Slaves\", written while she was in prison, was first published in \"TBS\" in 1971, Vol. 3, No. 4. She was still in prison on murder and kidnapping charges linked to George Jackson’s attempted escape from the Marin County Hall of Justice when the article was printed. \"TBS\"’ archives at UC Berkeley also house the last published writing by George Jackson while he was alive (Vol. 2, No. 10, June 1971), printed just two months before his fatal attempt to escape incarceration.\n\nThe journal continues to feature the most influential of contemporary Black scholars, critics and activists, from Gerald Early to Louis Chude-Sokei, Alexis Pauline Gumbs, Mark Anthony Neal, Nathaniel Mackey, Aldon Lynn Nielsen, Anthony Reed, Evie Shockley, David Marriott, Dionne Brand, Anthony Walton, Stephanie Batiste and so many more.\n\nActivism has always been a founding premise of \"The Black Scholar\". As a result of student and faculty agitation and strikes in the late 1960s, a Black Studies department was inaugurated at San Francisco State University. Robert Chrisman and Nathan Hare, along with other African-American faculty, were a part of the advisory board created to hire faculty for the new department. As activists in the Civil Rights Movement and the student movements of the 1960s (for instance, Nathan Hare was a leader of the Black University movement and fired at Howard University before his recruitment to San Francisco State), the founders of \"TBS\" used the journal not only as a publication informed by community activism but also as a hub for further activist work that addresses social inequality based on race, class, and gender in the United States and abroad.\n\nMany of \"TBS\"’ contributing and advisory editors have been involved with social and political activism such as organizing a political prisoners' fund, protests against the Vietnam War, trips to Cuba and revolutionary Nicaragua, a trip to the Eastern Bloc in 1985, and a speaker’s bureau to arrange speaking engagements for diverse thinkers of varying disciplines and experiences in and outside traditional academia. Founder Robert Chrisman represented \"TBS\" at a conference held in Havana, Cuba, where a large American delegation met with Angolan leaders Commandante Dibalo, Ogla Lima, and Pedro Zinga Baptista in support of the MPLA. A few months later Chrisman represented \"TBS\" at the Angola Support Conference, which opposed U.S. and South African intervention in Angola.\n\nThe published works produced by \"TBS\" editors have also promoted activism by spreading awareness of racial injustices. As a result of Robert L. Allen’s publication \"The Port Chicago Mutiny\", which shed light on the unjust and unsafe working conditions that Black Navy servicemen sustained during wartime efforts, social activists were inspired to rectify the injustices of the events. The surviving service members were honored by a group of California State Assemblymen in 1998, more than 50 years after these men were charged with mutiny for refusing to work under unsafe conditions. One of the men involved also received an official pardon by President Bill Clinton.\n\nOn June 30, 2012, founding editor Robert Chrisman officially retired from his long-standing position as Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of \"The Black Scholar\". He publicly announced his retirement in a letter published on the back page of the Spring 2012 issue of \"TBS\". Chrisman claimed that through the creation and the dissemination of such materials \"TBS\" was able to “establish a foundation and platform for late 20th-century Black criticism and scholarship.\" In his letter, Chrisman made reference to the transitioning direction and goals of the journal in the light of changes in the field of Black Studies and the intellectual interests of scholars and activists within it.\n\nHe ended his letter thanking those who provided support throughout his tenure, including his executive assistant Jacki Frommé, typographer Rick Giezentaner, Pat Scott, and Conyus Calhoun. Since retiring, Chrisman completed his third volume of poems, \"The Dirty Wars\", published in summer 2012 by Black Scholar Press, and continued to work on another volume of poetry entitled \"Minotaur\" and to work with Robert L. Allen on \"The Black Scholar\" archive at UC Berkeley. Chrisman died after a long illness on March 10, 2013.\n\nBlack Scholar Press was based in San Francisco, California. It began publishing books beginning in the 1970s, mostly regarding social science or poetry. Notable titles include: \n\nThe editors of \"The Black Scholar\" have published anthologies of notable articles from the journal, including:\n\n\"The Black Scholar\" archive was endowed to the African American Writers Collection at UC Berkeley’s Bancroft Library, which is \"one of the largest and most heavily used libraries of manuscripts, rare books, and unique materials in the United States\", as a means of furthering education on African-American history and social issues for future generations.\n\n\"Launched in 1978, The Bancroft Library’s African American Writers Collection contains thousands of books, manuscripts, correspondence, photographs, and other rare works by African American authors,\" ranging in date from the 1790s to contemporary society. Along with \"TBS\"’s extensive archive, the African American Writers Collection also houses the NAACP Archival Project and the Records of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.\n\n"}
{"id": "2417765", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2417765", "title": "The Honest Woodcutter", "text": "The Honest Woodcutter\n\nThe Honest Woodcutter, also known as Mercury and the Woodman and The Golden Axe, is one of Aesop's Fables, numbered 173 in the Perry Index. It serves as a cautionary tale on the need for cultivating honesty, even at the price of self-interest.\n\nThe Greek version of the story tells of a woodcutter who accidentally dropped his axe into a river and, because this was his only means of livelihood, sat down and wept. Taking pity on him, the god Hermes (also known as Mercury) dived into the water and returned with a golden axe. \"Was this what you had lost?\", Hermes asked, but the woodcutter said it was not, and returned the same answer when a silver axe was brought to the surface. Only when his own tool is produced does he claim it. Impressed by his honesty, the god allows him to keep all three. Hearing of the man's good fortune, an envious neighbor threw his own axe into the river and wailed for its return. When Hermes appeared and offered him a golden axe, the man greedily claimed it but was denied both that and the return of his own axe.\nThough the tale's moral is that 'Honesty is the best policy', as the English proverb has it, there existed a medieval Byzantine proverb apparently alluding to the fable, which stated that 'A river does not always bring axes'. But since this was glossed to mean that no person always acts consistently, it is obviously at a considerable remove from the story's application. The sequence of ideas that led to this understanding of the fable also exposes the gap in the envious neighbor's logic. He had observed the proximate cause for enrichment, namely dropping an axe in the river, and overlooked the ultimate cause - the need for scrupulous honesty. The right combination of circumstances had to be there for Hermes to act as he did. Without them, as the neighbor eventually learned, 'the river does not always bring (golden) axes'. \n\nA burlesque retelling of the fable occurs in François Rabelais's 16th-century novel \"Gargantua and Pantagruel\". It takes up most of the author's prologue to the 4th Book and is considerably extended in his typically prolix and circuitous style. The woodcutter's cries disturb the chief of the gods as he deliberates the world's business and he sends Mercury down with instructions to test the man with the three axes and cut off his head if he chooses wrongly. Although he survives the test and returns a rich man, the entire countryside decides to follow his example and gets decapitated. So, Rabelais concludes, it is better to be moderate in our desires. Much the same story is told in La Fontaine's Fables (V.1) but in more concentrated form. However, rather than beheading the woodman's imitators, Mercury merely administers a heavy blow.\n\nSome paintings named from the fable have been broad landscapes with small figures added in the middle plane. Salvator Rosa's \"Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman\" in the National Gallery, London, dates from about 1650. An 18th-century watercolour by George Robertson (1748–88) seems to derive from this. Charles-André van Loo gives greater prominence to the figures in his \"Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron\" in the Hôtel de Soubise. In this the god hovers in mid-air and presents the axes to the surprised and kneeling woodman. \n\nIllustrations of the fable on English chinaware draw on the woodcut in Samuel Croxall's edition of Aesop. A Wedgwood plate of about 1775 displays a red picture in a square, garlanded frame. The rim has a wavy edge printed with detached sprays of flowers. Much the same picture as there, printed in green, is used on a contemporary Liverpool tile. In the left foreground, Mercury is presenting an axe to the seated woodman. In the distance, on the opposite bank, his dishonest neighbour has raised his axe before throwing it into the river. \n\nIn 1987 the story was included on the 40 drachma value of the eight-stamp set of Aesop's fables issued by Greece and features the naked god seated on a rock in the river and offering the three axes to the bearded woodman on the bank.\n\nThe appearance of other tellings of the story, with local variations, from Nigeria, Thailand and Tibet, seems to call in question the purely Greek origin of the story. The Thai account claims to originate from a Buddhist Jataka tale but gives no source for a comparison to be made. Since the main lines of the story in all three are the same as in Aesopic versions, one might infer that, whatever their original form, they have since been influenced by the European model. \n\nA certain kinship has also been observed between the fable and the account of the miraculous recovery of an axe from a river in the Jewish Bible. There the prophet Elisha was travelling with some members of a religious community 'and when they came to the Jordan, they began cutting down trees; but it chanced that as one man was felling a trunk, the head of his axe flew off into the water. \"Oh master,\" he exclaimed, \"it was a borrowed one.\" \"Where did it fall?\" asked the man of God. When he was shown the place, he cut off a piece of wood and threw it in and made the iron float.' (NEB, Kings II, 6.4-6)\n\n"}
{"id": "1268268", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1268268", "title": "The Joys of Yiddish", "text": "The Joys of Yiddish\n\nThe Joys of Yiddish is a book containing a lexicon of common words and phrases of Yinglish—i.e., words originating in the Yiddish language that had become known to speakers of American English due to the influence of American Ashkenazi Jews. It was originally published in 1968 and written by Leo Rosten.\n\nThe book distinguished itself by how it explained the meaning of the Yiddish words and phrases: almost every entry was illustrated by a joke. This made the book not only a useful reference, but also a treasured collection of Jewish humor.\n\nAs is inevitable with any book that references popular culture, it quickly became dated due to the dramatic changes that American culture (and Jewish-American culture) underwent over the next 30 years. Rosten published revised versions of the book with different titles: \"Hooray for Yiddish!\" (1982) and \"The Joys of Yinglish\" (1989). In 2001, a new edition of the original book was published. Titled \"The New Joys of Yiddish\", it was revised by Lawrence Bush, with copious footnotes added to clarify passages that had become outdated. Some material was also rearranged.\n\nIn 1998, Charles Schumer and Al D'Amato were running for the position of United States Senator representing New York. During the race, D'Amato referred to Schumer as a \"putzhead\". \"The New York Times\" referenced the entry for \"putz\" in \"The Joy of Yiddish\" and maintained that the phrase did not merely mean \"fool\", as D'Amato insisted, but was significantly more pejorative: based on that entry, a better translation might be \"dickhead\". D'Amato ended up losing the race; some observers credit this incident with costing him the election.\n\nHarlan Ellison's 1974 science fiction story \"I'm Looking for Kadak\" (collected in Ellison's 1976 book \"Approaching Oblivion\" and in \"Wandering Stars: An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction\") is narrated by an eleven-armed Jewish alien from the planet Zsouchmuhn with an extensive Yiddish vocabulary. Ellison courteously provides a \"Grammatical Guide and Glossary for the Goyim\" in which, he says, \"The Yiddish words are mine ... but some of the definitions have been adapted and based on those in Leo Rosten's marvelous and utterly indispensable sourcebook \"The Joys of Yiddish\" ... which I urge you to rush out and buy, simply as good reading.\"\n\nDave McKean and Neil Gaiman's 2005 fantasy film \"MirrorMask\" includes Rosten's classic riddle, discussed in \"The Joys of Yiddish\" as follows:\n\nThe first riddle I ever heard, one familiar to almost every Jewish child, was propounded to me by my father:\n\n\"What is it that hangs on the wall, is green, wet -- and whistles?\"\nI knit my brow and thought and thought, and in final perplexity gave up.\n\"A herring,\" said my father.\n\"A herring,\" I echoed. \"A herring doesn't hang on the wall!\"\n\"So hang it there.\"\n\"But a herring isn't green!\" I protested.\n\"Paint it.\"\n\"But a herring isn't wet.\"\n\"If it's just painted it's still wet.\"\n\"But -- \" I sputtered, summoning all my outrage, \"-- a herring doesn't whistle!!\"\n\"Right, \" smiled my father. \"I just put that in to make it hard.\"\n\nJohn Updike's final novel in the Rabbit series, \"Rabbit at Rest\", copies Rosten's joke from the entry on \"tsuris\".\n\nThis book has a German translation published by Deutsche Taschenbuch Verlag, 11. 2002 and 4. 2003 : \"Jiddisch. Eine kleine Enzyklopädie\", a French one published by Éditions Calmann-Lévy , \"Les Joies du Yiddish\" and a Czech one published by Academia in 1998, \"Jidiš pro radost\", , republished by Leda in 2013, .\n\n"}

{"id": "30106", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30106", "title": "Theodicy", "text": "Theodicy\n\nTheodicy (), in its most common form, is an attempt to answer the question of why a good God permits the manifestation of evil, thus resolving the issue of the problem of evil. Some theodicies also address the evidential problem of evil by attempting \"to make the existence of an all-knowing, all-powerful and all-good or omnibenevolent God consistent with the existence of evil or suffering in the world.\" Unlike a defense, which tries to demonstrate that God's existence is logically possible in the light of evil, a theodicy attempts to provide a framework wherein God's existence is also plausible. The German mathematician and philosopher Gottfried Leibniz coined the term \"theodicy\" in 1710 in his work \"Théodicée\", though various responses to the problem of evil had been previously proposed. The British philosopher John Hick traced the history of moral theodicy in his 1966 work, \"Evil and the God of Love\", identifying three major traditions:\n\nThe problem was also analyzed by pre-modern theologians and philosophers in the Islamic world. German philosopher Max Weber (1864–1920) saw theodicy as a social problem, based on the human need to explain puzzling aspects of the world. Sociologist Peter L. Berger (1929–2017) argued that religion arose out of a need for social order, and an “implicit theodicy of all social order” developed to sustain it. Following the Holocaust, a number of Jewish theologians developed a new response to the problem of evil, sometimes called anti-theodicy, which maintains that God cannot be meaningfully justified. As an alternative to theodicy, a defense has been proposed by the American philosopher Alvin Plantinga, which is focused on showing the logical possibility of God's existence. Plantinga's version of the free-will defence argued that the coexistence of God and evil is not logically impossible, and that free will further explains the existence of evil without threatening the existence of God.\n\nSimilar to a theodicy, a cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe, and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the goodness of humanity.\n\nAs defined by Alvin Plantinga, theodicy is the \"answer to the question of why God permits evil\". Theodicy is defined as a theological construct that attempts to vindicate God in response to the evidential problem of evil that mitigates against the existence of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent deity. Another definition of theodicy is the vindication of divine goodness and providence in view of the existence of evil. The word \"theodicy\" derives from the Greek words Θεός \"Τheos\" and δίκη \"dikē\". \"Theos\" is translated \"God\" and \"dikē\" can be translated as either \"trial\" or \"judgement\". Thus, theodicy literally means \"justifying God\".\n\nIn the \"Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", Nick Trakakis proposed an additional three requirements which must be contained within a theodicy:\n\nAs a response to the problem of evil, a theodicy is distinct from a defence. A defence attempts to demonstrate that the occurrence of evil does not contradict God's existence, but it does not propose that rational beings are able to understand why God permits evil. A theodicy seeks to show that it is reasonable to believe in God despite evidence of evil in the world and offers a framework which can account for why evil exists. A theodicy is often based on a prior natural theology, which attempts to prove the existence of God, and seeks to demonstrate that God's existence remains probable after the problem of evil is posed by giving a justification for God's permitting evil to happen. Defenses propose solutions to the logical problem of evil, while theodicies attempt to answer the evidential (inductive) problem.\n\nPhilosopher [Susan Nieman] says \"a \"crime against humanity\" is something for which we have procedures, ... [and it] can be ... fit into the rest of our experience. To call an action \"evil\" is to suggest that it cannot [be fitted in]...\" \n\nMarxism, \"selectively elaborating Hegel,\" defines evil in terms of its effect. Philosopher John Kekes says the effect of evil must include actual harm \"that 'interferes with the functioning of a person as a full-fledged agent.' (Kekes 1998, 217).\" Christian philosophers and theologians such as Richard Swinburne and N. T. Wright also define evil in terms of effect saying an \"...act is objectively good (or bad) if it is good (or bad) in its consequences\". Hinduism defines evil in terms of its effect saying \"the evils that afflict people (and indeed animals) in the present life are the effects of wrongs committed in a previous life\". Some contemporary philosophers argue a focus on the effects of evil is inadequate as a definition since evil can observe without actively causing the harm, and it is still evil. \n\nPseudo-Dionysus defines evil by those aspects that show an absence of good. Writers in this tradition saw things as belonging to 'forms' and evil as an absence of being a good example of their form: as a deficit of goodness where goodness ought to have been present. In this same line of thinking, St. Augustine also defined evil as an absence of good, as did theologian and monk Thomas Aquinas who said: \"... a man is called \"bad\" insofar as he lacks a virtue, and an eye is called \"bad\" insofar as it lacks the power of sight.\" \"Bad\" as an absence of \"good\" resurfaces in Hegel, Heidegger and Barth. Very similar are the Neoplatonists, such as Plotinus and contemporary philosopher Denis O'Brien, who say evil is a privation. \n\nImmanuel Kant was the first to offer a purely secular theory of evil, giving an evaluative definition of evil based on its cause as having a will that is not fully good. Kant has been an important influence on philosophers like Hanna Arendt, Claudia Card, and Richard Bernstein. \"...Hanna Arendt... uses the term [radical evil] to denote a new form of wrongdoing which cannot be captured by other moral concepts.\" The Muslim also provides an evaluative definition of evil saying it is the result of the world not being fully Muslim. Claudia Card says evil is excessive wrong-doing; others like Hillel Steiner say evil is qualitatively not quantitatively distinct from mere wrongdoing. \n\nLocke, Hobbes and Liebniz define good and evil in terms of pleasure and pain. Others such as Richard Swinburne find that definition inadequate, saying, \"the good of individual humans...consists...in their having free will...the ability to develop ...character..., to show courage and loyalty, to love, to be of use, to contemplate beauty and discover truth... All that [good]...cannot be achieved without ... suffering along the way.\"\n\nSome theorists define evil by what emotions are connected to it. \"For example, Laurence Thomas believes that evildoers take delight in causing harm or feel hatred toward their victims (Thomas 1993, 76–77).\" Buddhism defines evil as behavior resulting from a failure to emotionally detach from the world.\n\nChristian theologians generally define evil in terms of both human responsibility and the nature of God: \"If we take the essentialist view of Christian ethics... evil is anything contrary to God's good nature...(character or attributes).\" The Judaic view, while acknowledging the difference between the human and divine perspective of evil, is rooted in the nature of creation itself and the limitation inherent in matter's capacity to be perfected; the action of freewill includes the potential for perfection from individual effort and leaves the responsibility for evil in human hands. \n\n\"[It is] deeply central to the whole tradition of Christian (and other western) religion that God is loving toward his creation and that involves him behaving in morally good ways toward it.\" Within Christianity \"God is supposed to be in some way personal... a being who is essentially eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, Creator and sustainer of the universe, and perfectly good. An omnipotent being is one who can do anything logically possible... such a being could not make me exist and not exist at the same time but he could eliminate the stars... An omniscient being is one who knows everything logically possible for him to know... he will not necessarily know everything that will happen [i.e. humans with freewill] unless it is predetermined that it will happen...\" God's perfect goodness is moral goodness. \"Western religion has always held that there is a deep problem about why there is pain and suffering--which there would not be if God were not supposed to be morally good... a personal being who was not morally good would not be the great being God is supposed to be... [Since theodicy is concerned with] the existence (or not) of the sort of God with which Western religion is concerned, this understanding of the definition of God must stand.\"\n\nGerman philosopher Max Weber interpreted theodicy as a social problem, and viewed theodicy as a \"problem of meaning\". Weber argued that, as human society became increasingly rational, the need to explain why good people suffered and evil people prospered became more important because religion casts the world as a \"meaningful cosmos\". Weber framed the problem of evil as the dilemma that the good can suffer and the evil can prosper, which became more important as religion became more sophisticated. He identified two purposes of theodicy: to explain why good people suffer (a theodicy of suffering), and why people prosper (a theodicy of good fortune). A theodicy of good fortune seeks to justify the good fortune of people in society; Weber believed that those who are successful are not satisfied unless they can justify why they deserve to be successful. For theodicies of suffering, Weber argued that three different kinds of theodicy emerged—predestination, dualism, and karma—all of which attempt to satisfy the human need for meaning, and he believed that the quest for meaning, when considered in light of suffering, becomes the problem of suffering.\n\nSociologist Peter L. Berger characterised religion as the human attempt to build order out of a chaotic world. He believed that humans could not accept that anything in the world was meaningless and saw theodicy as an assertion that the cosmos has meaning and order, despite evidence to the contrary. Berger presented an argument similar to that of Weber, but suggested that the need for theodicy arose primarily out of the situation of human society. He believed that theodicies existed to allow individuals to transcend themselves, denying the individual in favour of the social order.\n\nPhilosopher Richard Swinburne says \"most theists need a theodicy, [they need] an account of reasons why God might allow evil to occur. Without a theodicy evil counts against the existence of God.\"\n\nThe term \"theodicy\" was coined by German philosopher Gottfried Leibniz in his 1710 work, written in French, \"Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal\" (\"Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil\"). Leibniz's \"Théodicée\" was a response to skeptical Protestant philosopher Pierre Bayle, who wrote in his work \"Dictionnaire Historique et Critique\" that, after rejecting three attempts to solve it, he saw no rational solution to the problem of evil. Bayle argued that, because the Bible asserts the coexistence of God and evil, this state of affairs must simply be accepted.\n\nFrench philosopher Voltaire criticised Leibniz's concept of theodicy in his \"Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne\" (\"Poem on the Lisbon disaster\"), suggesting that the massive destruction of innocent lives caused by the Lisbon earthquake demonstrated that God was not providing the \"best of all possible worlds\". Voltaire also includes the earthquake/theodicy theme in his novel \"Candide\".\n\nIn \"The Catholic Encyclopedia\" (1914), Constantine Kempf argued that, following Leibniz's work, philosophers called their works on the problem of evil \"theodicies\", and philosophy about God was brought under the discipline of theodicy. He argued that theodicy began to include all of natural theology, meaning that theodicy came to consist of the human knowledge of God through the systematic use of reason.\n\nIn 1966, British philosopher John Hick published \"Evil and the God of Love\", in which he surveyed various Christian responses to the problem of evil, before developing his own. In his work, Hick identified and distinguished between three types of theodicy: Plotinian, which was named after Plotinus, Augustinian, which had dominated Western Christianity for many centuries, and Irenaean, which was developed by the Eastern Church Father Irenaeus, a version of which Hick subscribed to himself.\n\nIn his dialogue \"Is God a Taoist?\", published in 1977 in his book \"The Tao is Silent\", Raymond Smullyan claims to prove that it is logically impossible to have sentient beings without allowing \"evil\", even for God, just as it is impossible for him to create a triangle in the Euclidean plane having an angular sum other than 180°. So the capability of feeling implies free will, which in turn may produce \"evil\", understood here as hurting other sentient beings. The problem of evil happening to good or innocent people is not addressed directly here, but both reincarnation and karma are hinted at.\n\n“Writings and discourses on theodicy by Jews, Greeks, Christians, and Eastern religions have graced our planet for thousands of years.” In the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (2000 BC to 1700 BC) as “in Ancient Mesopotamian and Israelite literature,” theodicy was an important issue.\n\nDr Philip Irving Mitchell of the Dallas Baptist University notes that some philosophers have cast the pursuit of theodicy as a modern one, as earlier scholars used the problem of evil to support the existence of one particular god over another, explain wisdom, or explain a conversion, rather than to justify God's goodness. Professor Sarah Iles Johnston argues that ancient civilizations, such as the ancient Mesopotamians, Greeks, Romans, and Egyptians held polytheistic beliefs that may have enabled them to deal with the concept of theodicy differently. These religions taught the existence of many gods and goddesses who controlled various aspects of daily life. These early religions may have avoided the question of theodicy by endowing their deities with the same flaws and jealousies that plagued humanity. No one god or goddess was fundamentally good or evil; this explained that bad things could happen to good people if they angered a deity because the gods could exercise the same free will that humankind possesses. Such religions taught that some gods were more inclined to be helpful and benevolent, while others were more likely to be spiteful and aggressive. In this sense, the evil gods could be blamed for misfortune, while the good gods could be petitioned with prayer and sacrifices to make things right. There was still a sense of justice in that individuals who were right with the gods could avoid punishment.\n\nThe \"Epicurean trilemma\" however was already raised ~300BC by Epicurus. It is the first credited to describe the problem of reconciling an omnipotent deity with their benevolence and the existence of evil.\n\nThe biblical account of the justification of evil and suffering in the presence of God has both similarities and contrasts in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. For the Hebrew Bible, the Book of Job is often quoted as the authoritative source of discussion.\n\n\"The author of Job seeks to expand the understanding of divine justice ...beyond mere retribution, to include a system of divine sovereignty [showing] the King has the right to test His subject's loyalty... The book of Job corrects the rigid and overly simplistic doctrine of retribution in attributing suffering to sin and punishment. It closes with a focus on the bond between creator and creation, on placing one's trust in that, and on hope rooted in belief that God is in ultimate control.\"\n\nIt is generally accepted that God's responsive speeches in Job do not directly answer Job's complaints; God does not explain Himself or reveal the reason for Job's suffering to him; instead Yahweh's speeches focus on increasing Job's overall understanding of his relationship with God. This exemplifies Biblical theodicy. There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible \"does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives... Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications]. ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape.\" \n\nThis is in evidence in Yahweh's first and second speech in Job. Yahweh's first speech concerns human ignorance and God's authority. Job had seen himself at the center of events, lamenting that God has singled him out to oppress; God responds that Job is not the center, Yahweh is; His kingdom is complex, He governs on a large scale, and has the right to exercise divine authority; since God is the rightful owner of everything in the universe, Job cannot justly accuse Him of wrongful deprivation. Yahweh's second speech is against human self-righteousness. Job has vehemently accused God of thwarting justice as \"the omnipotent tyrant, the cosmic thug\". Some scholars interpret Yahweh's response as an admission of failure on His part, but He goes on to say He has the power and in His own timing will bring justice in the end.\n\n\"Isaiah is generally recognized as one of the most progressive books of the prophetic corpus.\" Hebrew Bible scholar Marvin A. Sweeney says \"...a unified reading of [Isaiah] places the question of theodicy at the forefront... [with] three major dimensions of the question...: Yahweh's identification with the conqueror, Yahweh's decree of judgment against Israel without possibility of repentance, and the failure of Yahweh's program to be realized by the end of the book.\" Christian theologians read some passages in Isaiah differently. \"In either case, suffering is understood as having transcendent meaning... human agency can give particular instances of suffering a mystical significance that transforms it into something productive.\"\n\nTheodicy in the book of Ezekiel (and also in Jeremiah 31:29-30) confronts the concept of personal moral responsibility. \"The main point is stated at the beginning and at the end--\"the soul that sins shall die\"--and is explicated by a case history of a family traced through three generations.\" It is not about heredity but is about understanding divine justice in a world under divine governance. \n\n\"Theodicy in the Minor Prophets differs little from that in Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel.\" For example, the first chapter of Habakuk raises questions about Yahweh's justice, laments God's inaction in punishing injustice, and looks for God's action in response--then objects to what God chooses. Instead of engaging in debate, God gives Habakuk a vision of the future which includes five oracles that form a theodicy: (1) God has a plan and has appointed a time for judgment. It may be slow in coming as humans see things, but it will come. (2) The woe oracles confront the prevalence of evil in the world and the justice those acts have earned (3) The vision of the manifestation of God is a recognition of God's power to address these issues (4) God as a warrior will fight for his people (5) The song of triumph says the faithful will prevail by holding to trust and hope. Joel and the other minor prophets demonstrate that theodicy and eschatology are connected in the Bible.\n\nPsalm 73 presents the internal struggle created by personal suffering and the prosperity of the wicked. The writer gains perspective when he \"enters the sanctuary of God (16-17)\" seeing that God's justice will eventually prevail. He reaffirms his relationship with Yahweh, is ashamed of his resentment, and chooses trust. Psalm 77 contains real outspokenness to God as well as determination to hold onto faith and trust. \n\nFor the Christian, the Scriptures assure him or her that the allowance of evil is for a good purpose based on relationship with God. \"Some of the good ... cannot be achieved without delay and suffering, and the evil of this world is indeed necessary for the achievement of those good purposes. ... God has the right to allow such evils to occur, so long as the 'goods' are facilitated and the 'evils' are limited and compensated in the way that various other Christian doctrines (of human freewill, life after death, the end of the world, etc.) affirm. ...the 'good states' which (according to Christian doctrine) God seeks are so good that they outweigh the accompanying evils.\" \n\nThis is somewhat illustrated in the Book of Exodus when Pharaoh is described as being raised up that God's name be known in all the earth Exodus 9:16. This is mirrored in Romans' ninth chapter, where Paul appeals to God's sovereignty as sufficient explanation, with God's goodness experientially known to the Christian.\n\nThe Protestant and Reformed reading of Augustinian theodicy, as promoted primarily by John Hick, is based on the writings of Augustine of Hippo, a Christian philosopher and theologian who lived from AD 354 to 430. The Catholic (pre-reformation) formulation of the same issue is substantially different and is outlined below. In Hick's approach, this form of theodicy argues that evil does not exist except as a privation—or corruption—of goodness, and therefore God did not create evil. Augustinian scholars have argued that God created the world perfectly, with no evil or human suffering. Evil entered the world through the disobedience of Adam and Eve and the theodicy casts the existence of evil as a just punishment for this original sin. The theodicy argues that humans have an evil nature in as much as it is deprived of its original goodness, form, order, and measure due to the inherited original sin of Adam and Eve, but still ultimately remains good due to existence coming from God, for if a nature was completely evil (deprived of the good), it would cease to exist. It maintains that God remains blameless and good.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic reading of Augustine, the issue of just war as developed in his book \"The City of God\" substantially established his position concerning the positive justification of killing, suffering and pain as inflicted upon an enemy when encountered in war for a just cause. Augustine asserted that peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not elaborating the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase, itself, in his work \"The City of God\". In essence, the pursuit of peace must include the option of fighting with all of its eventualities in order to preserve peace in the long-term. Such a war could not be pre-emptive, but defensive, to restore peace. Thomas Aquinas, centuries later, used the authority of Augustine's arguments in an attempt to define the conditions under which a war could be just.\n\nIrenaeus (died c. 202), born in the early second century, expressed ideas which explained the existence of evil as necessary for human development. Irenaeus argued that human creation comprised two parts: humans were made first in the image, then in the likeness, of God. The image of God consists of having the potential to achieve moral perfection, whereas the likeness of God is the achievement of that perfection. To achieve moral perfection, Irenaeus suggested that humans must have free will. To achieve such free will, humans must experience suffering and God must be at an epistemic distance (a distance of knowledge) from humanity. Therefore, evil exists to allow humans to develop as moral agents. In the twentieth century, John Hick collated the ideas of Irenaeus into a distinct theodicy. He argued that the world exists as a \"vale of soul-making\" (a phrase that he drew from John Keats), and that suffering and evil must therefore occur. He argued that human goodness develops through the experience of evil and suffering.\n\nIn direct response to John Hick's description of theodicy, Mark Scott has indicated that neither Augustine of Hippo nor Irenaeus of Lyons provide an appropriate context for the discussion of Hick's theistic version of theodicy. As a theologian among the Church Fathers who articulated a theory of \"apokatastasis\" (or universal reconciliation), Origen of Alexandria provides a more direct theological comparison for the discussion of Hick's presentation of universal salvation and theodicy. Neither Irenaeus nor Augustine endorsed a theology of universal salvation in any form comparable to that of John Hick.\n\nMichael Martin summarizes what he calls “relatively minor” theodicies.\n\nMu'tazila theologians approached the problem of theodicy within a framework of moral realism, according to which the moral value of acts is accessible to unaided reason, so that humans can make moral judgments about divine acts. They argued that the divine act of creation is good despite existence of suffering, because it allows humans a compensation of greater reward in the afterlife. They posited that individuals have free will to commit evil and absolved God of responsibility for such acts. God's justice thus consists of punishing wrongdoers. Following the demise of Mu'tazila as a school, their theodicy was adopted in the Zaydi and Twelver branches of Shia Islam.\n\nMost Sunni theologians analyzed theodicy from an anti-realist metaethical standpoint. Ash'ari theologians argued that ordinary moral judgments stem from emotion and social convention, which are inadequate to either condemn or justify divine actions. Ash'arites hold that God creates everything, including human actions, but distinguish creation (\"khalq\") from acquisition (\"kasb\") of actions. They allow individuals the latter ability, though they do not posit existence of free will in a fuller sense of the term. In the words of Al-Shahrastani (1086–1153):\n\nAsh'ari theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, also insists on ultimate divine transcendence and teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, so that on the question of God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted \"bila kayfa\" (without [asking] how).\n\nIbn Sina, the most influential Muslim philosopher, analyzed theodicy from a purely ontological, neoplatonic standpoint, aiming to prove that God, as the absolutely good First Cause, created a good world. Ibn Sina argued that evil refers either to a cause of an entity (such as burning in a fire), being a quality of another entity, or to its imperfection (such as blindness), in which case it does not exist as an entity. According to Ibn Sina, such qualities are necessary attributes of the best possible order of things, so that the good they serve is greater than the harm they cause.\n\nPhilosophical Sufi theologians such as Ibn Arabi were influenced by the neoplatonic theodicy of Ibn Sina. Al-Ghazali anticipated the optimistic theodicy of Leibniz in his dictum \"There is nothing in possibility more wonderful than what is.\" Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, who represented the mainstream Sunni view, challenged Ibn Sina's analysis and argued that it merely sidesteps the real problem of evil, which is rooted in the human experience of suffering in a world that contains more pain than pleasure.\n\nThe Hanbali scholar Ibn Taymiyya, whose writings became influential in Wahhabism, argued that, while God creates human acts, humans are responsible for their deeds as the agents of their acts. He held that divine creation is good from a casual standpoint, as God creates all things for wise purposes. Thus apparent evil is in actuality good in view of its purpose, and pure evil does not exist. This analysis was developed further with practical illustrations by Ibn al-Qayyim.\n\nIn 1998, Jewish theologian Zachary Braiterman coined the term anti-theodicy in his book \"(God) After Auschwitz\" to describe Jews, both in a biblical and post-Holocaust context, whose response to the problem of evil is protest and refusal to investigate the relationship between God and suffering. An anti-theodicy acts in opposition to a theodicy and places full blame for all experience of evil onto God, but must rise from an individual's belief in and love of God. Anti-theodicy has been likened to Job's protests in the Book of Job. Braiterman wrote that an anti-theodicy rejects the idea that there is a meaningful relationship between God and evil or that God could be justified for the experience of evil.\n\nThe Holocaust prompted a reconsideration of theodicy in some Jewish circles. French Jewish philosopher Emmanuel Levinas, who had himself been a prisoner of war in Nazi Germany, declared theodicy to be \"blasphemous\", arguing that it is the \"source of all immorality\", and demanded that the project of theodicy be ended. Levinas asked whether the idea of absolutism survived after the Holocaust, which he proposed it did. He argued that humans are not called to justify God in the face of evil, but to attempt to live godly lives; rather than considering whether God was present during the Holocaust, the duty of humans is to build a world where goodness will prevail.\n\nProfessor of theology David R. Blumenthal, in his book \"Facing the Abusing God\", supports the \"theology of protest\", which he saw as presented in the play, \"The Trial of God\". He supports the view that survivors of the Holocaust cannot forgive God and so must protest about it. Blumenthal believes that a similar theology is presented in the book of Job, in which Job does not question God's existence or power, but his morality and justice. Other prominent voices in the Jewish tradition commenting on the justification of God in the presence of the Holocaust have been the Nobel prize winning author Elie Wiesel and Richard L. Rubinstein in his book \"The Cunning of History\".\n\nRabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe of Chabad Lubavitch, sought to elucidate how faith (or trust, \"emunah\") in God defines the full, transcendental preconditions of anti-theodicy. Endorsing the attitude of \"holy protest\" found in the stories of Job and Jeremiah, but also in those of Abraham (Genesis 18) and Moses (Exodus 33), Rabbi Schneerson argued that a phenomenology of protest, when carried through to its logical limits, reveals a profound conviction in cosmic justice such, as we first find in Abraham's question: \"Will the Judge of the whole earth not do justice?\" (Genesis 18:25). Recalling Kant's 1791 essay on the failure of all theoretical attempts in theodicy, a viable practical theodicy is identified with messianism. This faithful anti-theodicy is worked out in a long letter of 26 April 1965 to Elie Wiesel.\n\nA number of Christian writers oppose theodicies. Todd Billings deems constructing theodicies to be a “destructive practice”. In the same vein, Nick Trakakis observes that “theodical discourse can only add to the world’s evils, not remove or illuminate them.” As an alternative to theodicy, some theologians have advocated “reflection on tragedy” as a more befitting reply to evil. For example, Wendy Farley believes that “a desire for justice” and “anger and pity at suffering” should replace “theodicy’s cool justifications of evil”. Sarah K. Pinnock opposes abstract theodicies that would legitimize evil and suffering. However, she endorses theodicy discussions in which people ponder God, evil, and suffering from a practical faith perspective.\n\nKarl Barth viewed the evil of human suffering as ultimately in the “control of divine providence”. Given this view, Barth deemed it impossible for humans to devise a theodicy that establishes \"the idea of the goodness of God\". For Barth, only the crucifixion could establish the goodness of God. In the crucifixion, God bears and suffers what humanity suffers. This suffering by God Himself makes human theodicies anticlimactic. Barth found a “twofold justification” in the crucifixion: the justification of sinful humanity and “the justification in which God justifies Himself”.\n\nChristian Science offers a rational, though widely unacceptable, solution to the problem by denying that evil ultimately exists. Mary Baker Eddy and Mark Twain had some contrasting views on theodicy and suffering, which are well-described by Stephen Gottschalk.\n\nRedemptive suffering based in Pope John Paul II's theology of the body embraces suffering as having value in and of itself. Eleonore Stump in \"Wandering in Darkness\" uses psychology, narrative and exegesis to demonstrate that redemptive suffering, as found in Thomistic theodicy, can constitute a consistent and cogent defence for the problem of suffering. \n\nAs an alternative to a theodicy, a defense may be offered as a response to the problem of evil. A defense attempts to show that God's existence is not made logically impossible by the existence of evil; it does not need to be true or plausible, merely logically possible. American philosopher Alvin Plantinga offers a free will defense which argues that human free will sufficiently explains the existence of evil while maintaining that God's existence remains logically possible. He argues that, if God's existence and the existence of evil are to be logically inconsistent, a premise must be provided which, if true, would make them inconsistent; as none has been provided, the existence of God and evil must be consistent. Free will furthers this argument by providing a premise which, in conjunction with the existence of evil, entails that God's existence remains consistent. Opponents have argued this defense is discredited by the existence of non-human related evil such as droughts, tsunamis and malaria.\n\nA cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe in the face of evil, and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of human nature in the face of the evils produced by humans.\n\nConsidering the relationship between theodicy and cosmodicy, Johannes van der Ven argued that the choice between theodicy and cosmodicy is a false dilemma. Philip E. Devenish proposed what he described as \"a nuanced view in which theodicy and cosmodicy are rendered complementary, rather than alternative concepts\". Theologian J. Matthew Ashley described the relationship between theodicy, cosmodicy and anthropodicy:\n\nEssential kenosis is a form of process theology, (also known as \"open theism\") that allows one to affirm that God is almighty, while simultaneously affirming that God cannot prevent genuine evil. Because out of love God necessarily gives freedom, agency, self-organization, natural processes, and law-like regularities to creation, God cannot override, withdraw, or fail to provide such capacities. Consequently, God is not culpable for failing to prevent genuine evil. Thomas Jay Oord's work explains this view most fully. \n\nGijsbert van den Brink effectively refutes any view which says God has restricted His power because of his love saying it creates a \"metaphysical dualism\", and it would not alleviate God's responsibility for evil because God could have prevented evil by not restricting himself. Van den Brink goes on to elaborate an explanation of power and love within the Trinitarian view which equates power and love, and what he calls \"the power of love\" as representative of God's involvement in the struggle against evil.\n\n\n\n"}

It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates alongside itself and usually events. A Gantt chart is a form of timeline used in project management.\n\nTimelines can use any time scale, depending on the subject and data. Most timelines use a linear scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This timescale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A timeline of evolution can be over millions of years, whereas a timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks can take place over minutes, and an explosion over milliseconds. While most timelines use a linear timescale, for very large or small timespans, logarithmic timelines use a logarithmic scale to depict time.\n\nThere are different types of timelines\n\nThere are many methods of visualizations for timelines. Historically, timelines were static images and generally drawn or printed on paper. Timelines relied heavily on graphic design, and the ability of the artist to visualize the data.\n\nTimelines, no longer constrained by previous space and functional limitations, are now digital and interactive, generally created with computer software. ChronoZoom is an example of computer-aided interactive timeline software.\n\nTimelines are often used in education to help students and researchers with understanding the order or chronology of historical events and trends for a subject. When showing time on a specific scale on an axis, a timeline can be used to visualize time lapses between events, durations (such as lifetimes or wars), and the simultaneity or overlap of spans and events.\n\nTimelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time.

Energy independence is espoused by those who want to leave the U.S. unaffected by global energy supply disruptions, and to restrict reliance upon politically unstable states for its energy security. Energy independence is highly concerned with oil, the source of the country's principal transport fuels.\n\nIn total energy consumption, the U.S. was between 86% and 91% self-sufficient in 2016. In May 2011, the country became a net exporter of refined petroleum products. As of 2014, the United States was the world's third-largest producer of crude oil, after Saudi Arabia and Russia. and second largest exporter of refined products, after Russia.\n\nAs of March 2015, 85% of crude oil imports came from (in decreasing volume): Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia.\n\nGreater energy self-sufficiency, it was claimed, would prevent major supply disruptions like the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis from recurring. Proponents argue that the potential for political unrest in major oil suppliers, such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Nigeria, is abundant, and often causes great fluctuations in crude oil prices (especially in the short-term).\n\nLarge individual US pipelines and other fuel infrastructure and extraction projects are controversial issues in U.S. politics.\n\nIn the early 20th century the United States became a major oil supplier to the world. World War II prompted a Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program but it did not go beyond research. In mid-century the country shifted from being a major exporter to a net importer. An import quota imposed in 1959 limited imports to a fraction of domestic production until 1973. After the 1973 oil crisis, the United States Department of Energy and Synthetic Fuels Corporation were created to address the problem of fuel import dependency.\n\nThe U.S.'s dependence on foreign oil rose from 26 percent to 47 percent between 1985 and 1989. \nAccording to the Washington & Jefferson College Energy Index, by 2012, American energy independence had decreased by 22% since the Presidency of Harry Truman. The U.S.'s imports of foreign oil fell to 36 percent in 2013, down from a high of 60 percent in 2006.\n\nMany proponents of energy independence look to the United States' untapped domestic oil reserves, either known or potential. Those who favor increasing domestic oil production often suggest removing many of the limitations on oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (see Arctic Refuge drilling controversy) and the outer continental shelf. Foreign dependence is not the only factor in North American energy politics, however; environmental concerns around land and water pollution and greenhouse gases are also matters of controversy.\n\nSome proponents of U.S. energy independence promote wider use of alternatives such as ethanol fuel, methanol, biodiesel, plug-in hybrids and other alternative propulsion. A 2013 report published by the Fuel Freedom Foundation said that without a shift to domestic feedstocks for fuel, such as natural gas and biomass, the US would not be able to achieve energy independence. As of 2014, the United States imposes an import tariff of 54 cents a gallon on ethanol fuel (there is no such import tariff on oil or methanol fuel). Ethanol fuel in Brazil is produced from sugarcane, which yields much more fuel per acre than the corn used for ethanol production in the United States.\n\nIn the United States, oil is primarily consumed as fuel for cars, buses, trucks and airplanes (in the form of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel). Two-thirds of U.S. oil consumption is due to the transportation sector. A national strategy designed to shift all transportation to a combined use of alternative fuels and plug-in hybrids is predicted to make the U.S. independent of petroleum (oil).\n\nIf alternative fuels are desired at any cost, then the U.S. could also make synthetic fuel from its coal reserves. Methanol, synthetic diesel and gasoline made from U.S. coal can replace petroleum-derived fuels for a hundred years, which is long enough to develop sustainable domestic renewable fuels such as cellulosic ethanol or methanol.\n\nOil imports are most problematic in domestic politics and energy security when they come from countries that are openly hostile to US foreign policy and interests (Iran, Venezuela, and formerly Iraq), are former or potential future rivals (Russia) or have questionable human rights practices (Saudi Arabia). Sometimes an alternative \"'North American energy independence\" is proposed, by which North America as a unit should be energy independent, but in which the U.S. could still import energy from Canada and Mexico, which are less problematic allies and more tightly economically integrated.\n\nA related, less absolute, policy may be called \"North American energy security\". In 2012 in an editorial to Canadian newspaper \"The Globe and Mail\" Mexican president elect Enrique Peña Nieto, called North American energy security a \"common goal\" of Canada and Mexico.\n\nThe benefits are argued to be similar to U.S. energy independence – the reduction of North America's energy dependence on unstable regions such as the Middle East and South America and accepting supplies from the reliable North American Free Trade Area, reducing exposure to terrorism abroad; lower balance of trade and foreign exchange stresses on the U.S. economy in an era when suppliers may begin to price oil in euros; the development of renewable energy sources to displace fossil fuels; and the promotion of energy conservation technology exportable to energy-poor nations.\n\nIn Canada and Mexico there is also the concern not to have energy policy dictated by the United States, as well as tension over U.S. ownership of energy companies.\n\nIn 1937 Mexico passed a constitutional amendment to nationalize its oil industry, which led to the creation of Pemex, the national oil company. There have been several proposals to privatize Pemex since, but they have never come to fruition as many Mexicans fear foreign control of this strategic industry.\n\nThe 1957 Canadian election was fought partially in response to the 1956 Pipeline Debate which concerned whether or not the government should allow a US-owned company to build a trans-Canadian gas pipeline and whether the route should be entirely within Canada or partly through the United States. The right-leaning Progressive Conservatives and leftist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation opposition parties opposed American involvement in the pipeline while the Liberal government supported it. The Liberals were defeated in the 1957 election.\n\nIn 1973 Canada created its own state energy company Petro-Canada. It began operations in 1976, though it bought assets from private companies rather than seizing them as in many other countries. In 1980 the National Energy Program was launched to create oil self-sufficiency within Canada. It attempted to use tax incentives to discourage oil exports (mostly from Western Canada, primarily the province of Alberta) to the US, and redirect these towards to the oil importing provinces of Eastern Canada. The Foreign Investment Review Agency was also created to screen foreign (mostly U.S.) takeovers of Canadian companies. These policies were bitterly opposed by the provincial government of Alberta, and were repealed and reversed during the Conservative government of 1984–1993 which sought closer economic ties with the U.S., including the Canada–US Free Trade Agreement of 1988.\n\nIn a 2012 poll of energy experts by \"Foreign Policy\" magazine, almost two-thirds of respondents said energy independence was not a sensible goal.\n\nHighlighting the difficulty of separating domestic and foreign oil sources, journalist Robert Bryce stated in 2008 that \"the trends of energy interdependence are growing and are inexorable\" and branded the idea of being able to choose where your oil came from as \"hogwash\".\n\nThe structure of the argument of critics is arranged as follows:\n\nRoger Howard has argued in the \"Wall Street Journal\" that oil dependence has significant benefits for the US and other oil-importing nations. First, the world's major oil exporters are highly dependent on their oil revenues, and fear rapid drops in the price of oil, such as occurred in late 2008 and in 2014/2015. Second, this fear restrains destructive actions by exporters: Howard cites the example of Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia. Russia's stock market plunged, and \"within a week capital outflow reached a massive $16 billion, suddenly squeezing domestic credit while the ruble collapsed in value.\" He also gives the example of Libya, where Muammar al-Gaddafi gave up his Pakistani nuclear weapons in exchange for the US lifting its economic sanctions, which had prevented Libya from increasing its oil production.\n\nIn his 2006 State of the Union Address, George W. Bush used the phrase \"addicted to oil\", a phrase widely discussed in the media.\n\nAndy Grove argues that energy independence is a flawed and infeasible objective, particularly in a network of integrated global exchange. He suggests instead that the objective should be energy resilience: resilience goes hand in hand with adaptability, and it also is reflected in important market ideas like substitutability. Resilience is one of the best features of market processes; the information transmission function of prices means that individual buyers and sellers can adapt to changes in supply and demand conditions in a decentralized way. His suggestion for how to increase the resilience of the U.S. energy economy is to shift use from petroleum to electricity (electrification), that can be produced using multiple sources of energy, including renewables.\n\nIn 2008 former vice president Al Gore challenged the United States to commit to producing all electricity from renewable sources (AERS) like solar and wind power in 10 years. Both the Center for Resource Solutions and current president Barack Obama have publicly stated they support Al Gore's AERS goal.\n\nCanada is the worlds second largest producer of hydroelectricity (after China) and exported three billion dollars worth of electricity to the US in 2015, mostly from the major hydro-producing provinces of Québec, Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama has repeatedly stated that the U.S. has begun \"freeing ourselves from foreign oil\" including during his 2012 reelection speech. Canadian observers have noted that his usage of \"foreign\" does not include Canada. Yet in November 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline from Alberta to the Gulf coast because of domestic environmental concerns over water quality as well as the general antipathy of the environmental movement to pipeline building, and the production practices in the source (the Athabasca Oil Sands).\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}
{"id": "1030676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1030676", "title": "Untranslatability", "text": "Untranslatability\n\nUntranslatability is a property of a text, or of any utterance, in one language, for which no equivalent text or utterance can be found in another language when translated. This term often arises to describe the difficulty of achieving the so-called perfect translation based on the notion that there are thought processes and words that are so interrelated so that translation becomes an impossible task. Terms are, however, neither exclusively translatable nor exclusively untranslatable; rather, the degree of difficulty of translation depends on their nature, as well as on the translator's knowledge of the languages in question.\n\nThere is a school of thought identified with Walter Benjamin that identifies the concept of \"sacred\" in relation to translation and this pertains to the text that is untranslatable because its meaning and letter cannot be disassociated. It stems from the view that translation should realize the imagined perfect relationship with the original text. This theory highlights the paradoxical nature of translation wherein it - as a process - assumes the forms of necessity and impossibility at the same time. This is demonstrated in Jacques Derrida's analysis of the myth of Babel, a word which he described as a name that means confusion and also a proper name of God. Furthermore, Derrida noted that when God condemned the Shems to a multiplicity of tongues, he created a paradoxical need and impossibility of translation. \n\nDerrida himself has put forward his own notion of the untranslatability of the text, arguing in his early works such as the \"Writing and Difference\" and \"Margins of Philosophy\" that there is an excess of untranslatable meaning in literature and these cannot be reduced to a closed system or a restricted economy \"in which there is nothing that cannot be made to make sense.\"\n\nBrian James Baer posits that untranslatability is sometimes seen by nations as proof of the national genius. Literature that can be easily translated may be considered as lacking originality, while translated work themselves may be regarded merely as imitations. Baer quotes Jean-Jacques Rousseau defining true genius as \"the kind that creates and makes everything out of nothing\". Paraphrasing Robert Frost's remark about poetry (\"Poetry is what gets lost in translation\"), Baer suggests that \"one could define national identity as that which is lost in translation\". He further quotes Alexandra Jaffe: \"When translators talk about untranslatable, they often reinforce the notion that each language has its own 'genius', an 'essence' that naturally sets it apart from all other languages and reflects something of the 'soul' of its culture or people\".\n\nQuite often, a text or utterance that is considered to be \"untranslatable\" is considered a \"lacuna\", or lexical gap. That is, there is no one-to-one equivalence between the word, expression or turn of phrase in the source language and another word, expression or turn of phrase in the target language. A translator can, however, resort to a number of translation procedures to compensate for this. From this perspective, untranslatability or difficulty of translation does not always carry deep linguistic relativity implications; denotation can virtually always be translated, given enough circumlocution, although connotation may be ineffable or inefficient to convey.\n\n\"N.B.: The majority of examples and illustrations given below will involve translating to or from the English language.\"\n\nThe translation procedures that are available in cases of lacunae, or lexical gaps, include the following:\n\nAn adaptation, also known as a free translation, is a procedure whereby the translator replaces a term with cultural connotations, where those connotations are restricted to readers of the original language text, with a term with corresponding cultural connotations that would be familiar to readers of the translated text.\n\nFor example, in the Belgian comic book \"The Adventures of Tintin\", Tintin's trusty canine sidekick \"Milou\" is translated as \"Snowy\" in English, \"Bobbie\" in Dutch, \"Kuttus\" in Bengali, and \"Struppi\" in German; likewise the detectives \"Dupont\" and \"Dupond\" become \"Thomson\" and \"Thompson\" in English, \"Jansen\" and \"Janssen\" in Dutch, \"Jonson\" and \"Ronson\" in Bengali, \"Schultze\" and \"Schulze\" in German, \"Hernández\" and \"Fernández\" in Spanish, and (\"Dùběn\" and \"Dùpéng\") in Chinese, \"Dyupon\" and \"Dyuponn\" in Russian and \"Skafti\" and \"Skapti\" in Icelandic.\n\nAdaptation is often used when translating poetry, works of theatre, and advertising.\n\nBorrowing is a translation procedure whereby the translator uses a word or expression from the source text in the target text unmodified.\n\nIn English text, borrowings not sufficiently anglicised are normally in italics.\n\nCalque entails taking an expression, breaking it down to individual elements and translating each element into the target language word for word. For example, the German word \"\" can be calqued to \"single-representation-claim\", but a proper translation would result in \"exclusive mandate\". Word-by-word translations usually have comic value, but can be a means to save as much of the original style as possible, especially when the source text is ambiguous or undecipherable to the translator.\n\nParaphrase, sometimes called periphrasis, is a translation procedure whereby the translator replaces a word in the source text by a group of words or an expression in the target text. For example, the Portuguese word is often translated into English as \"the feeling of missing a person who is gone\". A similar example is \"dor\" in Romanian, translated into English as \"missing someone or something that's gone and/or not available at the time\".\n\nAn example of untranslatability is seen in the Dutch language through the word , which does not have an English equivalent, though the German equivalent \"Gemütlichkeit\" is sometimes used. Literally, it means a cozy, friendly, or nice atmosphere, but can also connote time spent with loved ones, the fact of seeing a friend after a long absence, the friendliness or chattiness of a specific person, or a general sense of togetherness. Such gaps can lead to word borrowing, as with pajamas or Zeitgeist.\n\nA translator's note is a note (usually a footnote or an endnote) added by the translator to the target text to provide additional information pertaining to the limits of the translation, the cultural background, or any other explanations.\n\nAlthough Thai has words that can be used as equivalent to English \"I\", \"you\", or \"he/she/it\", they are relatively formal terms (or markedly informal). In most cases, Thai people use words which express the relation between speaker and listener according to their respective roles. For instance, for a mother to say to her child \"I'll tell you a story\", she would say \"แม่จะเล่านิทานให้ลูกฟัง\" (mae ja lao nitaan hai luuk fang), or \"Mother will tell child a story\". Similarly, older and younger friends will often use sibling terminology, so that an older friend telling a younger friend \"You're my friend\" would be \"น้องเป็นเพื่อนพี่\" (nawng pen peuan pii), would translate directly as \"Younger sibling is older sibling’s friend\". To be translated into English correctly, it is proper to use \"I\" and \"you\" for these example statements, but normal Thai perceptions of relation are lost in the process. Similar phenomena can also be observed in Indonesian. One may use the formal form of pronouns, which are generally distinct from the informal/familiar forms; however, the use of these pronouns does not evoke sufficient friendliness or intimacy, especially in spoken language. Instead of saying \"\"Anda mau pesan apa?\", a waiter/waitress will most likely say \"Bapak/Ibu mau pesan apa?\"\" (lit. Sir/Madam wants to order what?). Both expressions are equally polite; however, the latter is more sympathetic and friendly. When conversing with family and relatives, most Indonesians also prefer using kinship terminology (father, mother, brother, sister, etc.) when addressing elder family members. When addressing younger family members, informal pronouns are more prevalent.\n\nTranslating the English word \"have\" to Arabic, Bengali, Finnish, Hebrew, Hindi, Irish, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Turkish, Urdu, or Welsh, is somewhat difficult, as there is no specific verb with this meaning in these languages. Instead, for \"I have X\" these languages use a combination of words that mean \"X is to me\"; or (in Finnish) \"at me is X\"; (in Turkish) \"my X exists\" or \"at me exists X\"; or (in Hebrew) \"there-is of-me (represents ownership, could mean to-me) X.\"\n\nIn Hungarian, there is a word corresponding to \"have\": \"bír\" — but its use is quite scarce today usually turning up in very formal and legal texts. It also sounds outdated, since it was used to translate the Latin \"habeo\" and the German \"haben\" possessive verbs when these languages had official status in Hungary. The general grammatical construction used is \"there is a(n) X of mine\". For example, the English sentence \"I have a car.\" translates to Hungarian as \"Van egy autóm.\" which would translate back to English word by word as \"There is a car of mine.\".\n\nA similar construction occurs in Russian, where \"I have\" translates literally into \"at (\"or\" by) me there is\". Russian does have a word that means \"to have\": (\"imet'\") — but it is very rarely used by Russian speakers in the same way English speakers use the word \"have\"; in fact, in some cases, it may be misinterpreted as vulgar slang for the subject rudely using the object for sexual gratification; for example, in an inept translation of \"Do you have a wife?\"\n\nIn Japanese, the English word \"to have\" is most often translated into the verbs iru (いる or 居る) and aru (ある or 有る). The former verb is used to indicate the presence of a person, animal, or other living creature (excluding plant life) while the latter verb is closer to the English \"to have\" and is used for inanimate objects. \"I have a pen\" becomes \"Watashi ni wa pen ga aru\" (私にはペンがある) which can be represented in English as \"I (topic) pen (subject) exists\". To indicate the English \"have\" in the sense of possession, the Japanese language uses the verb motsu (持つ), which literally means \"to carry.\" This could be used as \"Kare wa keitai wo motteiru\" (彼は携帯を持っている), which becomes \"He (subject) cellphone (object) is carrying\" or \"He has a cellphone\".\n\nEnglish lacks some grammatical categories.\n\nThere is no simple way in English to contrast Finnish or Polish (continuing, corresponding to English \"to write\") and or (a regular frequentative, \"to occasionally write short passages at a time\", or \"to jot down now and then\"). Also, and (to jump once) and and (to continuously jump; to be jumping from point A to B) are another example.\n\nIrish allows the prohibitive mood to be used in the passive voice. The effect is used to prohibit something while expressing society's disapproval for that action at the same time. For example, contrast \"Ná caithigí tobac\" (meaning \"Don't smoke\" when said to multiple people), which uses the second person plural in the imperative meaning \"Do not smoke\", with \"Ná caitear tobac\", which is best translated as \"Smoking just isn't done here\", uses the autonomous imperative meaning \"One does not smoke\".\n\nItalian has three distinct declined past tenses, where (), () and () all mean \"I was\", the first indicating a concluded action in the (remote) past, the second a progressive or habitual action in the past, and the latter an action that holds some connection to the present, especially if a recent time is specified (\"stamattina ho visto\" for \"this morning I saw\"). The \" is often used for narrative history (for example, novels).\nNowadays, the difference between \" and \" is blurred in the spoken language, the latter being used in both situations. What difference there exists is partly geographic. In the north of Italy the \" is very rarely used in everyday speech, whereas in the south it often takes the place of the \"\". The distinction is only alive in Tuscany, which makes it dialectal even if hardline purists insist it should be applied consistently.\n\nLikewise, English lacks a productive grammatical means to show indirection but must instead rely on periphrasis, that is the use of multiple words to explain an idea. Finnish grammar, on the contrary, allows the regular production of a series of verbal derivatives, each of which involves a greater degree of indirection. For example, on the basis of the verb \"vetää\" (to pull), it is possible to produce:\n\nHindi has a similar concept of indirection. 'Karna' means 'to do'; 'karaana' means 'to make someone do'; 'karwaana' means 'to get someone to make yet another person do'\n\nMost Turkic languages (Turkish, Azeri, Kazakh, etc.) contain the grammatical verb suffix \"miş\" (or \"mis\" in other dialects), which indicates that the speaker did not witness the act personally but surmises or has discovered that the act has occurred or was told of it by another, as in the example of \"Gitmiş!\" (Turkish), which can be expressed in English as \"it is reported that he/she/it has gone\", or, most concisely, as \"apparently, he/she/it has gone\". This grammatical form is especially used when telling jokes, or narrating stories.\n\nSimilar to the Turkic \"miş\", nearly every Quechua sentence is marked by an evidential clitic, indicating the source of the speaker's knowledge (and how certain s/he is about the statement). The enclitic \"=mi\" expresses personal knowledge (\"Tayta Wayllaqawaqa chufirmi\", \"Mr. Huayllacahua is a driver - I know it for a fact\"); \"=si\" expresses hearsay knowledge (\"Tayta Wayllaqawaqa chufirsi\", \"Mr. Huayllacahua is a driver, or so I've heard\"); \"=chá\" expresses high probability (\"Tayta Wayllaqawaqa chufirchá\", \"Mr. Huayllacahua is a driver, most likely\"). Colloquially, the latter is also used when the speaker has dreamed the event told in the sentence or experienced it under alcohol intoxication.\n\nLanguages that are extremely different from each other, like English and Chinese, need their translations to be more like adaptations. Chinese has no tenses per se, only three aspects. The English verb \"to be\" does not have a direct equivalent in Chinese. In an English sentence where \"to be\" leads to an adjective (\"It \"is\" blue\"), there is no \"to be\" in Chinese. (There are no adjectives in Chinese, instead there are stative verbs that do not need an extra verb.) If it states a location, the verb \"zài\" () is used, as in \"We \"are\" in the house\". In some other cases (usually when stating a judgement), the judgment verb \"shì\" () is used, as in \"I \"am\" the leader.\" And in most other cases, such structure (\"to be\") is simply not used, but some more natural structure in Chinese is used instead. Any sentence that requires a play on those different meanings will not work the same way in Chinese. In fact, very simple concepts in English can sometimes be difficult to translate, for example, there is no single direct translation for the word \"yes\" in Chinese, as in Chinese the affirmative is said by repeating the verb in the question. (\"Do you have it?\" \"(I) have\".)\n\nGerman, Dutch and Danish have a wealth of modal particles that are particularly difficult to translate as they convey sense or tone rather than strictly grammatical information. The most infamous example perhaps is \"doch\" (Dutch: \"toch\", Danish: \"dog\"), which roughly means \"Don't you realize that . . . ?\" or \"In fact it is so, though someone is denying it.\" What makes translating such words difficult is their different meanings depending on intonation or the context.\n\nA common use of the word \"doch\" can be found in the German sentence \"Der Krieg war doch noch nicht verloren\", which translates to \"The war wasn't lost yet, after all\" or \"The war was still not lost.\"\n\nSeveral other grammatical constructs in English may be employed to translate these words for each of their occurrences. The same \"Der Krieg war doch noch nicht verloren\" with slightly changed pronunciation can also mean excuse in defense to a question: \". . . but the war was not lost yet (. . . so we fought on).\"\n\nA use which relies heavily on intonation and context could produce yet another meaning: \"So the war was really not over yet (as you have been trying to convince me all along).\"\n\nAnother change of intonation makes the sentence a question. \"Der Krieg war doch noch nicht verloren?\" would translate into \"(You mean) the war was not yet lost (back then)?\"\n\nAnother well-known example comes from the Portuguese or Spanish verbs and , both translatable as \"to be\" (see Romance copula). However, is used only with essence or nature, while is used with states or conditions. Sometimes this information is not very relevant for the meaning of the whole sentence and the translator will ignore it, whereas at other times it can be retrieved from the context.\n\nWhen none of these apply, the translator will usually use a paraphrase or simply add words that can convey that meaning. The following example comes from Portuguese:\n\nSome South Slavic words that have no English counterparts are \"doček\", a gathering organized at someone's arrival (the closest translation would be \"greeting\" or \"welcome\"; however, a 'doček' does not necessarily have to be positive); and \"limar\", a sheet metal worker.\n\nFor various reasons, such as differences in linguistic features or culture, it is often difficult to translate terms for family members.\n\nMany Bengali kinship words consider both gender and age. For example, Father's elder brothers are called \"Jethu\" (জ্যাঠা)' while younger brothers are called \"Kaku\" (কাকু). Their wives are called \"Jethi-ma\" (জেঠি-মা) and \"Kaki-ma\" (কাকি-মা), respectively. Father's sister is called \"Pisi\" (পিসি), mother's sister is \"Maasi\" (মাসি). Mother's brother is called \"Mama\" (মামা) and his wife, \"Mami\" (মামি). English would just use \"Uncle\" and \"Aunt\". An elder brother is \"Dada\" (দাদা), elder sister is \"Didi\" (দিদি), while the younger brother is \"Bhai\" (ভাই) and younger sister, \"Bon\" (বোন). Similar is the case with many Indian languages like Hindi, Gujarati and many others including Punjabi and Urdu for many relationships amongst family and relatives.\n\nIt is usually also difficult to translate simple English kinship words accurately into Chinese, for Chinese distinguishes very many kinship terms, depending on the person's actual position in family kinship.\n\nMost Thai words expressing kinship have no direct translations and require additional words. There are no Thai equivalents for most daily English kinship terms, as English terms leave out much information that is natural to Thai.\n\nAs an example, Thai does not distinguish between siblings by gender, but by age. Siblings older than yourself are พี่ (Pii), and those younger are น้อง (Nawng). Almost similar distinctions apply to aunts and uncles, based on whether they are older or younger than the sibling parent, and also whether they are maternal or paternal uncles. Thai disregards gender when aunts or uncles are younger than his/her parents. But when aunts and uncles are older siblings of his/her parents, gender comes to differentiate them but whether they are from maternal or paternal side is no longer important. For instance, น้า (Naa) means \"mother's younger brother/sister\". อา (Aah) means \"father's younger brother/sister\". But ลุง (Loong) means \"father's or mother's older brother\" and ป้า (Paa) means \"father's or mother's older sister\". As for nieces, nephews, and grandchildren, Thai only has one genderless word, หลาน (Laan) to describe all of them.\n\nIn Arabic, \"brother\" is often translated into أخ (\"Akh\"). However, whilst this word may describe a brother who shares either one or both parents, there is a separate word - شقيق (\"Shaqīq\") - to describe a brother with whom one shares both parents.\n\nIn Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Lao, Tagalog, Turkish, most north Indian languages, Sinhala, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Hungarian there are separate words for \"older brother\" and \"younger brother\" and, likewise, \"older sister\" and \"younger sister\". The simple words \"brother\" and \"sister\" are rarely used to describe a person, and most commonly appear in the plural. (In Hungarian, however, the terms \"fiútestvér\" and \"lánytestvér\", meaning \"male sibling\" and \"female sibling\" respectively, exist but are not commonly used.). On the other hand, the word for 'sibling' in many other languages lacks the slightly technical/non-colloquial nature of the English word, which often leads to native speakers preferring the longer 'brother(s) and/or sister(s)' instead.\n\nSwedish, Norwegian and Danish have the terms \"farmor\" (father's mother) and \"farfar\" (father's father) for paternal grandparents, and \"mormor\" (mother's mother) and \"morfar\" (mother's father) for maternal grandparents. The English terms great-grandfather and great-grandmother also have different terms in Swedish, depending on lineage. This distinction between paternal and maternal grandparents is also used in Chinese, Korean, Thai, Malayalam as well as Punjabi, Urdu, Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali and other Indo-Aryan languages.\n\nNorwegian also has the terms \"sønnesønn\", \"dattersønn\", \"datterdatter\" and \"sønnedatter\", meaning respectively \"son of my son\", \"son of my daughter\", \"daughter of my daughter\", and \"daughter of my son\". Similar words exist in Swedish, Danish and Icelandic. In both cases, there exist terms synonymous with the English grand-prefixed ones which are used when exact relation is not an issue. This distinction is also used in the Indian languages as mentioned above and Chinese, whereas Chinese almost always states the relationship clearly.\n\nIn Danish, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, Persian, Turkish, Chinese, Swedish and South Slavic languages there are different words for the person indicated by \"mother's brother\", \"father's brother\" and \"parent's sister's husband\", all of which would be \"uncle\" in English. German had distinct words for maternal uncles (Oheim) and maternal aunts (Muhme), but they are not used any more. An exactly analogous situation exists for \"aunt\". In Thai, Hindi, Malayalam and Punjabi this concept is taken a step further in that there are different words for the person indicated by \"mother's elder brother\" and \"mother's younger brother\", as well as \"father's elder brother\" and \"father's younger brother\".\n\nThe Polish language used to distinguish \"paternal uncle\" (\"stryj\") and \"maternal uncle\" (\"wuj\"), but the first term is now archaic.\n\nSwedish (and Danish) has words \"tant/tante\" for \"auntie\" (\"rarely used in Swedish\") or \"old lady\" in general, \"moster\" for maternal aunt, and \"faster\" for paternal aunt, but the last two are contractions of mors syster/søster and fars syster/søster (\"mother's sister\" and \"father's sister\", respectively). The same construction is used for uncles (rendering \"morbror\" and \"farbror\"). In Danish, and occasionally in Swedish, the word \"onkel\" corresponds to the Danish word \"tante\".\n\nThe distinction between maternal and paternal uncles has caused several mistranslations; for example, in Walt Disney's \"DuckTales\", Huey, Dewey, and Louie's Uncle Scrooge was translated \"Roope-setä\" in Finnish (Paternal Uncle Robert) before it was known Scrooge was Donald's \"maternal\" uncle. The proper translation would have been \"Roope-eno\" (Maternal Uncle Robert). This is also the case for Donald Duck, who is called \"Aku-setä\" in Finnish and not \"Aku-eno\", despite being the brother of Huey, Dewey and Louie's mother. The nephews used to be called \"veljenpojat\" (brother's sons); today they are called [perhaps more fittingly]] \"ankanpojat\" (literally \"ducklings\").\n\nArabic contains separate words for \"mother's brother\" خال (\"Khāl\") and \"father's brother\" عم (\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>Amm\"). The closest translation into English is \"uncle\", which gives no indication as to lineage, whether maternal or paternal. Similarly, in Arabic, there are specific words for the father's sister and the mother's sister, خالة (\"Khala(h)\") and عمة (\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>Amma(h)\"), respectively (in both cases being the feminine forms of the masculine nouns, by addition of fatḥa-tāʾ marbūṭah). Bengali has separate words for such relations, too.\n\nAlbanian distinguishes maternal and paternal aunts and uncles; paternal uncle and aunt being \"ungj/xhaxha\" and \"hallë\" respectively, while maternal uncle and aunt being \"dajë\" and \"teze\" respectively.\n\nIsiZulu, spoken in South Africa by the Zulu people, distinguishes between maternal and paternal uncles and aunts. Paternal uncles (father's brothers) are designated as 'fathers' where 'baba omkhulu' (meaning 'great father') designates brothers older than the father, and 'baba omncane' 'meaning 'small father' designates brothers younger than the father. The archaic 'babekazi' meaning 'female father' or the modern 'Anti' borrowed from the English 'Aunt' is used for the father's sisters. Likewise, the mother's sisters are also 'mothers' with the mother's older sisters designated as 'mama omkhulu' (meaning 'great mother') and the mother's younger sisters designated as 'mama omncane' (meaning 'small mother'). The mother's brother is called 'malume'- which is the translation of the usual English uncle and is the one used conventionally as in English- to apply to older family friends, respected older males or male peers of the parents. In Zulu culture, a child of the father's brothers or the mother's sisters is 'brother' (or 'mfowethu') or 'sister' (or 'dadewethu') since their parent is a 'father' or 'mother'. 'Mzala' (cousin) is applied to children of one's mother's brother or father's sister.\n\nWhereas English has different words for the child of one's sibling based on its gender (\"nephew\" for the son of one's sibling, \"niece\" for the daughter), the word \"cousin\" applies to both genders of children belonging to one's aunt or uncle. Many languages approach these concepts very differently.\n\nThe Polish language distinguishes a male cousin who is the son of an uncle (\"\"brat stryjeczny\") and a male cousin who is the son of an aunt (\"brat cioteczny\"); and a female cousin who is the daughter of an uncle (\"siostra stryjeczna\") and a female cousin who is the daughter of an aunt (\"siostra cioteczna\"). Polish distinguishes four kinds of nephew and niece: the son of a brother (\"bratanek\"), the daughter of a brother (\"bratanica\"), the son of a sister (\"siostrzeniec\"), and the daughter of a sister (\"siostrzenica\"\").\n\nThough Italian distinguishes between male () and female () cousins where English does not, it uses (nephew or niece) for both genders, though a masculine or feminine article preceding this can make the distinction. Moreover, this word can also mean \"grandchild\", adding to its ambiguity. However, though the words are the same, the concepts are distinguished, so when hearing about a one is likely to ask whether a child's child or a sibling's child is meant. To clarify the relationship, Italians generally add the diminutive when referring to grandchildren .\n\nAlbanian as well has two genders for cousins, male (\"kushëri\") and female (\"kushërirë\"). It also distinguishes between nephew (\"nip\") and niece (\"mbesë\"), but those words can also mean \"grandson\" and \"granddaughter\" respectively.\n\nThe Macedonian language also distinguishes between male ( ()) and female ( ()) cousins, the son or daughter (respectively) to an aunt or uncle. The Bulgarian language is similar in this respect, and contains an extensive list of words for referring to family members and relatives, including relations by marriage and acquaintance.\n\nSpanish and Portuguese distinguish in both cases: the son of a sibling is \"sobrino\" or \"sobrinho\", whereas a daughter is \"sobrina\" or \"sobrinha\"; likewise a male cousin is \"primo\", while a female cousin is \"prima\". However, when used in the plural, and both genders are involved, only the masculine form is used. If a speaker says that he went out with his cousins (\"primos\") last night, it could refer to a group of all men, or of men and women. All women would use the female form. This is a general rule in that the plural male form is used in any group of people that may be of mixed gender, not just cousins.\n\nNorwegian and Danish also distinguish both cases: the son of a sibling is \"nevø\", whereas a daughter is \"niece\"; equally a male cousin is \"fætter\", while a female cousin is \"kusine\". Collectively the term \"søskendebarn\" is used for both. Swedish does not distinguish between male and female cousins. For children of siblings, Swedish has three levels of specificity: the term \"syskonbarn\" for all such people regardless of sibling gender and child gender. There is also \"brorsbarn\" or \"systerbarn\" depending on the gender of the sibling whose children it is. Finally, Swedish uses the terms \"brorson\", \"brorsdotter\", \"systerson\", and \"systerdotter\" to exactly describe the relation between the two people referred to. The most specific terms are the most commonly used, with \"brorsbarn\" or \"systerbarn\" usually used when one wants to speak about the children of one sibling as a group.\n\nDutch, on the other hand, distinguishes gender: (male) and (female). Nephews and nieces are commonly given a diminutive form, and respectively (although these can also sometimes refer to younger cousins).\n\nHindi, Hebrew and Arabic contain no word for \"cousin\" at all; one must say \"uncle's son\" or an equivalent.\n\nCousins from different generations such as \"third cousin twice removed\" can be readily expressed in English, but many languages do not have equivalently succinct constructs.\n\nThere is no standard English word for the Italian \"consuoceri\", Yiddish \"makhatunim\", Spanish \" or Portuguese \": a gender-neutral collective plural like \"co-in-laws\". If Harry marries Sally, then in Yiddish, Harry's father is the \"mekhutn\" of Sally's father; each mother is the \"makheteyneste\" of the other. In Romanian, they are \"“cuscri”\". In Bengali, both fathers are \"beayi\" and mothers, \"beyan\". Bengali has \"dada\"/\"bhai\" for \"brother\" and \"jamai-babu\"/\"bhagni-pati\" for \"brother-in-law\"; \"chhele\" for \"son\" and \"jamai\" for \"son-in-law\".\n\nSpanish and Portuguese contrast \"brother\" with \"brother-in-law\" (\"/\", \"/\"); \"son\" with \"son-in-law\" (\"/\", \"/\"), and similarly for female relatives like \"sister-in-law\" (\"/\") and \"daughter-in-law\" (\"/\"). Both languages use \"\" (Sp.) or \"/\" (varying by dialect), as the relationship between two men that marry siblings (or two women, using the feminine \"/\" instead). In the English language this relationship would be lumped in with \"/\" (sibling's husband or spouse's brother) as simply \"brother-in-law\".\n\nSerbian and Bosnian have specific terms for relations by marriage. For example, a \"sister-in-law\" can be a \"snaha/snaja\" (brother's wife, though also family-member's wife in general), \"zaova\" (husband's sister), \"svastika\" (wife's sister) or \"jetrva\" (husband's brother's wife). A \"brother-in-law\" can be a \"zet\" (sister's husband, or family-member's husband in general), \"djever/dever\" (husband's brother), \"šurak/šurjak\" (wife's brother) or \"badžanak/pašenog\" (wife's sister's husband). Likewise, the term \"prijatelj\" (same as \"makhatunim\" in Yiddish, which also translates as \"friend\") is also used. Bengali has a number of in-law words. For example, \"Boudi\" (elder brother's wife), \"Shaali\" (wife's sister), \"Shaala\" (wife's younger brother), \"Sambandhi\" (wife's elder brother/Shaali's husband), \"Bhaasur\" (husband's elder brother), \"Deor\" (husband's younger brother) \"Nanad\" (husband's sister), \"Jaa\" (husband's brother's wife), etc.\n\nIn Russian, fifteen different words cover relations by marriage, enough to confuse many native speakers. There are for example, as in Yiddish, words like \" and \" for \"co-in-laws\". To further complicate the translator's job, Russian in-laws may choose to address each other familiarly by these titles.\n\nIn contrast to all of the above fine distinctions, in American English the term \"my brother-in-law\" covers \"my spouse's brother\", \"my sibling's husband\", and \"my spouse's sibling's husband\". In British English, the last of these is not considered strictly correct. \n\nJapanese has a concept, \"amae\", about the closeness of parent-child relationship, that is supposedly unique to that language and culture as it applies to bosses and workers.\n\nObjects unknown to a culture can actually be easy to translate. For example, in Japanese, \"wasabi\" is a plant (\"Wasabia japonica\") used as a spicy Japanese condiment. Traditionally, this plant only grows in Japan. It would be unlikely that someone from Angola (for example) would have a clear understanding of it. However, the easiest way to translate this word is to \"borrow\" it. Or one can use a similar vegetable's name to describe it. In English this word is translated as \"wasabi\" or \"Japanese horseradish\". In Chinese, people can still call it \"wasabi\" by its Japanese sound, or pronounce it by its Hanzi characters, (pinyin: \"shān kuí\"). However, wasabi is currently called 芥末 (jiè mò) or 绿芥 (lǜ jiè) in China and Taiwan. Horseradish is not usually seen in Eastern Asia; people may parallel it with mustard. Hence, in some places, \"yellow mustard\" refers to imported mustard sauce; \"green mustard\" refers to wasabi.\n\nAnother method is using description instead of a single word. For example, languages like Russian and Ukrainian have borrowed words \"Kuraga\" and \"Uruk\" from Turkic languages. While both fruits are now known to the Western world, there are still no terms for them in English. English speakers have to use \"dried apricot without core\" and \"dried apricot with core\" instead.\n\nOne particular type of foreign object that poses difficulties is the proper noun. As an illustration, consider another example from Douglas Hofstadter, which he published in one of his \"Metamagical Themas\" columns in \"Scientific American\". He pondered the question, \"Who is the first lady of Britain?\" Well, first ladies reside at the Prime Minister's address, and at the time, the woman living at 10 Downing Street was Margaret Thatcher. But a different attribute that first ladies have is that they are married to heads of government, so perhaps a better answer was \"Denis\" Thatcher, but he probably would not have relished the title.\n\nThe two areas which most nearly approach total untranslatability are poetry and puns; poetry is difficult to translate because of its reliance on the sounds (for example, rhymes) and rhythms of the source language; puns, and other similar semantic wordplay, because of how tightly they are tied to the original language. The oldest well-known examples are probably those appearing in Bible translations, for example, Genesis 2:7, which explains why God gave Adam this name: \"God created Adam out of soil from the ground\"; the original Hebrew text reveals the secret, since the word Adam connotes the word ground (being \"Adama\" in Hebrew), whereas translating the verse into other languages loses the original pun.\n\nSimilarly, consider the Italian adage \"traduttore, traditore\": a literal translation is \"translator, traitor\". The pun is lost, though the meaning persists. (A similar solution can be given, however, in Hungarian, by saying \"a fordítás: ferdítés\", which roughly translates as \"translation is distortion\".)\n\nThat being said, many of the translation procedures discussed here can be used in these cases. For example, the translator can compensate for an \"untranslatable\" pun in one part of a text by adding a new pun in another part of the translated text.\n\nOscar Wilde's play \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" incorporates in its title a pun (resonating in the last line of the play) that conflates the name Ernest with the adjective of quality \"earnest\". The French title of the translated play is \"L'importance d'être Constant\", replicating and transposing the pun; however, the character Ernest had to be renamed, and the allusion to trickery was lost. (Other French translations include \"De l'importance d'être Fidèle\" (faithful) and \"Il est important d'être Aimé\" (loved), with the same idea of a pun on first name / quality adjective.) A recent Hungarian translation of the same play by Ádám Nádasdy applied a similar solution, giving the subtitle \"Szilárdnak kell lenni\" (lit. \"One must be Szilárd\") beside the traditional title \"Bunbury\", where \"Szilárd\" is a male name as well as an adjective meaning \"solid, firm\", or \"steady\". Other languages, like Spanish, usually leave the pun untranslated, as in \"La importancia de llamarse Ernesto\", while one translation used the name Severo, which means \"severe\" or \"serious\", close to the original English meaning. Catalan translations always use \"La importància de ser Frank\". This example uses the homophones \"Frank\" (given name) and \"franc\" (honest, free-spoken). Although this same solution would work in Spanish also (\"La importancia de ser Franco\"), it carries heavy political connotations in Spain due to Francisco Franco's dictatorship (1939–1975), to a point that even this possible title can be taken directly as ironic/sarcastic: literally, \"The importance of being Franco\", so this alternative was never used.\n\nThe Asterix comic strip is renowned for its French puns; its translators have found many ingenious English substitutes.\n\nOther forms of wordplay, such as spoonerisms and palindromes are equally difficult, and often force hard choices on the translator. For example, take the classic palindrome: \"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama\". A translator might choose to translate it literally into, say, French – \"\"Un homme, un projet, un canal: Panama\", if it were used as a caption for a photo of Theodore Roosevelt (the chief instigator of the Canal), and sacrifice the palindrome. But if the text is meant to give an \"example\" of a palindrome, he might elect to sacrifice the literal sense and substitute a French palindrome, such as \"Un roc lamina l'animal cornu\"\" ('A boulder swept away the horned animal').\n\nDouglas Hofstadter discusses the problem of translating a palindrome into Chinese, where such wordplay is theoretically impossible, in his book – which is devoted to the issues and problems of translation, with particular emphasis on the translation of poetry. Another example given by Hofstadter is the translation of the jabberwocky poem by Lewis Carroll, with its wealth of neologisms and portmanteau words, into a number of foreign tongues.\n\nA notable Irish joke is that it is not possible to translate mañana into Irish as the Irish \"don't have a word that conveys that degree of urgency\".\n\nAccording to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, \"iconicity might be the reason for refraining from translating \"Hallelujah\" and \"Amen\" in so many languages, as if the sounds of such basic religious notions have to do with their referents themselves – as if by losing the sound, one might lose the meaning. Compare this to the cabbalistic power of letters, for example in the case of gematria, the method of interpreting the Hebrew Scriptures by interchanging words whose letters have the same numerical value when added. A simple example of gematric power might be the famous proverb \"nikhnas yayin yåSå sōd\", lit. \"entered wine went out secret\", i.e. \"wine brings out the truth\", \"in vino veritas\". The gematric value of \"wine\" is 70 (י=10; י=10; ן=50) and this is also the gematric value of \"secret\" (ס=60; ו=6; ד=4). Thus, this sentence, according to many Jews at the time, had to be true.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3210824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3210824", "title": "Vjetrenica", "text": "Vjetrenica\n\nVjetrenica (, which means \"wind cave\" or \"blowhole\") is the largest and most important cave in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and one of the most important caves in the Dinaric Alps mountain range, which is famous worldwide for its karstic and speleological riches. It is located in the Popovo field in Ravno, East Herzegovina in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nVjetrenica is located in Popovo Polje (pronounced , meaning \"priest's field\", where polje stands for karstic plain), which is itself located in a southernmost regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, West Herzegovina, near the Adriatic coast. \nIts entrance is near the village of Zavala, in west - south-western corner of polje. In the warmer parts of the year a strong blast of cold air blows from its entrance, which is very attractive in the middle of the rocky, hot and waterless terrain.\n\nPopovo Polje is one of the largest polje (karstic plain) in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the world, famous for its karstic phenomenons and features, and particularly for its Trebišnjica River, which flows through the polje as largest sinking river (also \"losing stream\", or \"influent stream\") the world, as well as the Vjetrenica cave system, located to the west/south-western parts of the valley. \n\nThe cave has been explored and described to a total of 7,014 m in length; of this the main channel is about 2.47 km long. It runs from the edge of Popovo Polje to the south, and on the basis of analysis of the terrain, geologists have predicted that Vjetrenica could stretch right to the Adriatic Sea in the Republic of Croatia, 15–20 km away from its entrance. Along with the hydrological arguments, this assumption is also supported by the \"unnatural\" end of Vjetrenica in the form of a huge heap of stone blocks that have caved in.\n\nVjetrenica is the richest cave in the world in terms of subterranean biodiversity: among more than two hundred different species are registered in it, almost hundred are troglophiles, a great number of them are narrow endemic, 15 are stenoendemic, and about 37 were discovered and described in Vjetrenica for the first time.\n\nLocated in Popovo Polje in Ravno municipality, village Zavala with its old architecture and stone masonry, together with Vjetrenica cave, constitute the natural and architectural ensemble, which is in the process of being protected as \"National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina\", and as such it is already placed on UNESCO Tentative List.\n\nVjetrenica cave is considered to have richest cave fauna, with highest rate of endemism. \nVjetrenica cave also acquired fame throughout the world geological and biological scientific communities, as well as environmental communities around the country and the world for its imperiled and uncertain future, caused by unprofessional management lacking any expertise, and uncertain status at state and especially local level.\n\nDespite all setbacks government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, although creepingly slowly, nominated Vjeternica (with village Zavala) to UNESCO Tentative List clearly expressing intention to protect the cave and its biodiversity and eventually inscribe it with UNESCO.\n\n\n"}
