The book contains thirteen ghost stories from the U.S. state of Alabama. The book was the first in a series of seven \"Jeffrey\" books, most featuring ghost stories from a Southern state. Jeffrey in the book's title refers to a ghost that allegedly haunts Windham's home.\n\nThe foreword of the book describes how Windham came to be interested in ghost stories. It began with ghostly incidents in the Windham family home in Selma that Windham attributed to a spirit she dubbed \"Jeffrey\". At first, the family heard footsteps in rooms that would later be found empty. A supposed photograph of Jeffrey, included in the book, was taken inside the home. On the night the picture was made, some young people visiting the house decided to play with a Ouija board, trying to contact Jeffrey. When they developed the photos taken that night, a shadowy vaguely human-like shape was seen beside a girl in the photograph. Soon after it was taken Windham contacted Figh, who was a noted collector of ghost stories, to ask about Jeffrey. Out of that meeting, the idea of \"13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey\" was born.\n\nIn the preface to the book, Windham says that although there are many ghost stories in Alabama, she wanted to choose stories for her book that had \"entertained many generations\" and were \"a treasured part of Southern folklore\". Windham sought stories from which she could describe not only the ghost, but also the community and lifestyles of the people who first reported the haunting. Windham spends as much time describing the people and places around the ghost stories as she does the ghost itself.\n\n\nDespite being very popular in Alabama, the book attracted some controversy from certain Christians in the state who said that the book promoted beliefs incompatible with Christianity. In fact, Windham said that she had received letters from people telling her she is doomed to hell for writing the \"Jeffrey\" books. In an interview with \"The Birmingham News\", Windham responded to these claims, saying \"If I'm going to hell — and I can't deny that, because it's not for me to judge — it won't be for telling ghost stories; I have far greater shortcomings than that.\"\n\n\"13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey\" has been adapted into a stage musical by Don Everett Garrett and Kevin Francis Finn. Kathryn Tucker Windham gave her blessing for the adaptation and saw the premiere at Red Mountain Theatre Company's Cabaret Theatre in October 2010, prior to her death. The musical is now available to schools and arts organizations from the authors.\n"}

{"id": "31572452", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31572452", "title": "Almond Blossoms", "text": "Almond Blossoms\n\nAlmond Blossoms is from a group of several paintings made in 1888 and 1890 by Vincent van Gogh in Arles and Saint-Rémy, southern France of blossoming almond trees. Flowering trees were special to van Gogh. They represented awakening and hope. He enjoyed them aesthetically and found joy in painting flowering trees. The works reflect the influence of Impressionism, Divisionism, and Japanese woodcuts. \"Almond Blossom\" was made to celebrate the birth of his nephew and namesake, son of his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo.\n\nIn 1888 van Gogh became inspired in southern France and began the most productive period of his painting career. In connection with their painting \"Farmhouse in Provence\" (1888), the National Gallery of Art notes that\n\"It was sun that van Gogh sought in Provence, a brilliance and light that would wash out detail and simplify forms,\nreducing the world around him to the sort of pattern he admired in Japanese woodblocks. Arles, he said, was \"the Japan of the South.\" Here, he felt, the flattening effect of the sun would strengthen the outlines of compositions and reduce nuances of color to a few vivid contrasts. Pairs of complements—the red and green of the plants, the woven highlights of oranges and blue in the fence, even the pink clouds that enliven the turquoise sky — almost vibrate against each other.\"\n\nWhen van Gogh arrived in Arles in March 1888 fruit trees in the orchards were about to bloom. The blossoms of the apricot, peach and plum trees motivated him, and within a month he had created fourteen paintings of blossoming fruit trees. Excited by the subject matter, van Gogh completed nearly one painting a day. Around April 21 he wrote to Theo, that he \"will have to seek something new, now the orchards have almost finished blossoming.\"\nVan Gogh's work reflected his interest in Japanese wood block prints. Hiroshige's \"Plum Park in Kameido\" demonstrates portrayal of beautiful subject matter with flat patterns of colors and no shadow. Van Gogh used the term \"Japonaiserie\" to express this influence; he collected hundreds of Japanese prints and likened the works of the great Japanese artists, like Hiroshige, to those of Rembrandt, Hals, and Vermeer. Hiroshige was one of the last great masters of the Japanese genre called \"ukiyo-e\". Van Gogh integrated some of the technical aspects of ukiyo-e into his work as his two 1887 homages to Hiroshige demonstrates.\n\nThe Japanese paintings represent Van Gogh's search for serenity, which he describes in a letter to his sister, \"Having as much of this serenity as possible, even though one knows little – nothing – for certain, is perhaps a better remedy for all diseases than all the things that are sold at the chemist's shop.\" The southern region and the flowering trees seems to awakened van Gogh from his doldrums into a state of clear direction, hyper-activity and good cheer. He wrote, \"I am up to my ears in work for the trees are in blossom and I want to paint a Provençal orchard of astonishing gaiety.\" While in the past a very active period would have drained him, this time he was invigorated.\n\nVincent wrote to Theo, \"Down here it is freezing hard and there is still snow in the countryside,\" and he has \"two small studies of an almond-tree branch already in flower in spite of it.\" The two studies are \"Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass\" and \"Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass with a Book.\"\n\nAlthough fruit trees were about to bloom when Vincent arrived in Arles, the town had just received a layer of snow, driving van Gogh inside for his first week in Arles where he worked on still life, such as a branch from an almond tree. To reflect the early signs of spring, he used delicate brushstrokes and pastel shades for \"Blossoming Almond Branch in a Glass\".\n\nIn \"Art Inspiring Transmutations of Life\", Bruce Ross evaluates the Impressionists' effect on van Gogh's work, \n\"Van Gogh's bright \"Sprig of Flowering Almond in a Glass\" embodies these streams* while exploring Japanese aesthetic values. A broken-off sprig is set in a simple glass. The sprig is highlighted by a red line along the beige wall and lavish empty space. There is no formal decorative intent. Van Gogh's name, also in bright red, hovers above a sprig in the upper left as if a symbol of hope. Van Gogh has transformed the still life with the help of these values. He has imbued a form predicated on death to one focused on life and possibility. His use of bright color reflects this. There is an individual, and hence essential, character to his subject, a sprig of almond buds and opening blossoms. This still life resembles the Japanese art of flower arrangement, ikebana, in its simplicity and evoked hopefulness as well as in its formal use of empty space.\"\n\nIn mid-March 1888 van Gogh writes of the weather and that the almond trees are coming into full flower, \"The weather here is changeable, often windy with turbulent skies, but the almond trees are beginning to flower everywhere.\"\n\nMancoff says of flowering trees and this work,\n\"In his flowering trees, Vincent attained a sense of spontaneity, freeing himself from the strict self-analytical approach he took in Paris. In \"Almond Tree in Blossom\", Vincent used the light, broken strokes of impressionism and the dabs of colour of divisionism for a sparkling surface effect. The distinctive contours of the tree and its position in the foreground recall the formal qualities of Japanese prints.\"\n\nThe rendering of \"Almond Blossom\" is positioned close and accessible to the viewer and the branches appear to reach out beyond the painting's frame.\n\nTheo wrote to his brother Vincent on January 31, 1890 to announce the birth of his son, Vincent Willem van Gogh. As a means of celebration, Vincent began work on a painting for Theo and his wife. He was very close to his brother and he sought to symbolize new life in the flowers of the almond tree for the birth of baby Vincent.\n\nVincent wrote to his mother of the birth of Theo and Jo's baby,\n\"How glad I was when the news came... I should have greatly preferred him to call the boy after Father, of whom I have been thinking so much these days, instead of after me; but seeing it has now been done, I started right away to make a picture for him, to hang in their bedroom, big branches of white almond blossom against a blue sky.\"\n\nThe composition is unlike any other of van Gogh's paintings. The branches of the almond tree seem to float against the blue sky and fill the picture plane. The close-up of the branches brings to mind Delacroix's proposition that \"even a part of a thing is kind of a complete entity in itself.\" Dark lines outline the branches. This is a feature that Van Gogh had admired in Japanese floral studies that, for example, may depict a portion of a stalk of bamboo in an empty space. The bright color is reflective of the paintings made in Arles and the transformational work van Gogh had on the still life genre.\n\n"}

{"id": "254519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=254519", "title": "Bluebeard", "text": "Bluebeard\n\n\"Bluebeard\" (French: \"Barbe bleue\") is a French folktale, the most famous surviving version of which was written by Charles Perrault and first published by Barbin in Paris in 1697 in \"Histoires ou contes du temps passé\". The tale tells the story of a wealthy violent man in the habit of murdering his wives and the attempts of one wife to avoid the fate of her predecessors. \"The White Dove\", \"The Robber Bridegroom\" and \"Fitcher's Bird\" (also called \"Fowler's Fowl\") are tales similar to \"Bluebeard\". The notoriety of the tale is such that Merriam-Webster gives the word \"Bluebeard\" the definition of \"a man who marries and kills one wife after another,\" and the verb \"bluebearding\" has even appeared as a way to describe the habit of either killing a series of women, or seducing and abandoning a series of women.\n\nBluebeard is a wealthy and powerful, yet frighteningly ugly, nobleman who has been married several times to beautiful women who have all mysteriously vanished. When Bluebeard visits his neighbor and asks to marry one of his daughters, the girls are terrified. After hosting a wonderful banquet, he chooses the youngest daughter to be his wife - against her will - and she goes to live with him in his rich and luxurious palace in the countryside, away from her family.\n\nBluebeard announces that he must leave for the country and gives the keys of the château (castle) to his wife. She is able to open any door in the house with them, each of which contain some of his riches, except for an underground chamber that he strictly forbids her to enter lest she suffer his wrath. He then goes away and leaves the house and the keys in her hands. She invites her sister, Anne, and her friends and cousins over for a party. However, she is eventually overcome with the desire to see what the forbidden room holds, and she sneaks away from the party and ventures into the room.\n\nShe immediately discovers the room is flooded with blood and the murdered corpses of Bluebeard's former wives hanging on hooks from the walls. Horrified, she drops the key in the blood and flees the room. She tries to wash the blood from the key, but the key is magical and the blood cannot be removed. Fearing for her life, she reveals her husband's secret to her visiting sister, and they plan to both flee the next morning, but Bluebeard unexpectedly comes back and finds the bloody key. In a blind rage, he threatens to kill her on the spot, but she asks for one last prayer with her sister Anne. At the last moment, as Bluebeard is about to deliver the fatal blow, the brothers of the wife and her sister Anne arrive and kill Bluebeard. The wife inherits his fortune and castle, and has the dead wives buried. She uses the fortune to have her other siblings married, and eventually remarries herself, to a man she loves, and moves on from her horrible experience with Bluebeard.\n\nAlthough best known as a folktale, the character of Bluebeard appears to derive from legends related to historical individuals in Brittany. One source is believed to have been the 15th-century Breton and convicted serial killer Gilles de Rais, a nobleman who fought alongside Joan of Arc and became both Marshal of France and her official protector, then, was burned as a murderous witch. However, Gilles de Rais did not kill his wife, nor were any bodies found on his property, and the crimes for which he was convicted involved the sexually-driven, brutal murder of children rather than women.\n\nAnother possible source stems from the story of the early Breton king Conomor the Accursed and his wife Tryphine. This is recorded in a biography of St. Gildas, written five centuries after his death in the sixth century. It describes how after Conomor married Tryphine, she was warned by the ghosts of his previous wives that he murders them when they become pregnant. Pregnant, she flees; he catches and beheads her, but St. Gildas miraculously restores her to life, and when he brings her to Conomor, the walls of his castle collapse and kill him. Conomor is a historical figure, known locally as a werewolf, and various local churches are dedicated to Saint Tryphine and her son, Saint Tremeur.\n\nThe character's blue beard stands for the marvelous and the exotic, for aristocracy (Bluebeard was a wealthy nobleman with blue blood), and for Bluebeard's status as an outsider, a libertine, and a ruffian (\"barbe,\" the French word for beard, relates to \"barbarian\").\n\nThe fatal effects of female curiosity have long been the subject of story and legend. Eve, Lot's wife, Pandora, and Psyche are all examples of mythic stories where women's curiosity is punished by dire consequences. The Bluebeard story also echoes the story of The Fall. In giving his wife the keys to his castle, Bluebeard is acting the part of the serpent, and therefore of the devil, and his wife the part of the victim held by the serpent's gaze.\n\nIn addition, hidden or forbidden chambers were not unknown in pre-Perrault literature. In Basile's \"Pentamerone\", the tale \"The Three Crowns\" tells of a Princess Marchetta entering a room after being forbidden by an ogress, and in \"The Arabian Nights\" Prince Agib is given a hundred keys to a hundred doors but forbidden to enter the golden door, which he does with terrible consequences.\n\nWhile some scholars interpret the Bluebeard story as a fable preaching obedience to wives (as Perrault's moral suggests), folklorist Maria Tatar has suggested that the tale encourages women not to unquestioningly follow patriarchal rules. Women breaking men's rules in the fairy tale can be seen as a metaphor for women breaking society's rules and being punished for their transgression. The key can be seen as a sign of disobedience or transgression; it can also be seen as a sign that one should not trust their husband.\n\nJungian psychoanalyst Clarissa Pinkola Estés refers to the key as \"the key of knowing\" which gives the wife consciousness. She can choose to not open the door and live as a naive young woman. Instead, she has chosen to open the door of truth.\n\nFor folklorist Bruno Bettelheim, \"Bluebeard\" can only be considered a fairy tale because of the magical bleeding key; otherwise, it would just be a monstrous horror story. Bettelheim sees the key as associated with the male sexual organ, \"particularly the first intercourse when the hymen is broken and blood gets on it.\" For Bettelheim, the blood on the key is a symbol of the wife's indiscretion.\n\nFor scholar Philip Lewis, the key offered to the wife by Bluebeard represents his superiority, since he knows something she does not. The blood on the key indicates that she now has knowledge. She has erased the difference between them, and in order to return her to her previous state, he must kill her.\n\nAccording to the Aarne–Thompson system of classifying folktale plots, the tale of Bluebeard is type 312.\nAnother such tale is \"The White Dove\", an oral French variant. The type is closely related to Aarne–Thompson type 311 in which the heroine rescues herself and her sisters, in such tales as \"Fitcher's Bird\", \"The Old Dame and Her Hen\", and \"How the Devil Married Three Sisters\". The tales where the youngest daughter rescues herself and the other sisters from the villain is in fact far more common in oral traditions than this type, where the heroine's brother rescues her. Other such tales do exist, however; the brother is sometimes aided in the rescue by marvelous dogs or wild animals.\n\nSome European variants of the ballad \"Lady Isabel and the Elf Knight\", Child ballad 4, closely resemble this tale. This is particularly noteworthy among some German variants, where the heroine calls for help much like Sister Anne calls for help to her brothers in Perrault's \"Bluebeard\".\n\nIt is not explained why Bluebeard murdered his first bride; she could not have entered the forbidden room and found a dead wife. But some scholars have theorized that he was testing his wife's obedience, and that she was killed not for what she discovered there, but because she disobeyed his orders.\n\nIn the 1812 version published in \"Grimms' Fairy Tales\", Wilhelm Grimm, on p. XLI of the annotations, makes the following handwritten comment: \"It seems in all Märchen [fairy tales] of Bluebeard, wherein his Blutrunst [flowing of blood] has not rightly explained, the idea to be the basis of himself through bathing in blood to cure of the blue beard; as the lepers. That is also why it is written that the blood is collected in basins.\"\n\nMaurice Maeterlinck wrote extensively on Bluebeard and in his plays names at least six former wives: Sélysette from \"Aglavaine et Sélysette\" (1896), Alladine from \"Alladine et Palomides\" (1894), both Ygraine and Bellangère from \"La mort de Tintagiles\" (1894), Mélisande from \"Pelléas et Mélisande\", and Ariane from \"Ariane et Barbe-bleue\" (1907).\n\nIn Jacques Offenbach's opera \"Barbe-bleue\" (1866), the five previous wives are Héloïse, Eléonore, Isaure, Rosalinde and Blanche, with the sixth and final wife being a peasant girl, Boulotte, who finally reveals his secret when he attempts to have her killed so that he can marry Princess Hermia.\n\nBéla Bartók's opera \"A Kékszakállú herceg vára\" (1911), with a libretto by Béla Balázs, names \"Judith\" as wife number four.\n\nAnatole France's short story \"The Seven Wives of Bluebeard\" names Jeanne de Lespoisse as the last wife before Bluebeard's death. The other wives were Collette Passage, Jeanne de la Cloche, Gigonne, Blanche de Gibeaumex, Angèle de la Garandine, and Alix de Pontalcin.\n\nIn Edward Dmytryk's film \"Bluebeard\" (1972), Baron von Sepper (Richard Burton) is an Austrian aristocrat known as Bluebeard for his blue-toned beard and his appetite for beautiful wives, and his wife is an American named Anne.\n\nOther versions of \"Bluebeard\" include:\n\nIn Charles Dickens' short story \"Captain Murderer\", the titular character is described as \"an offshoot of the Bluebeard family\", and is far more bloodthirsty than most Bluebeards: he cannibalises each wife a month after marriage. He meets his demise after his sister-in-law, in revenge for the death of her sister, marries him and consumes a deadly poison just before he devours her.\n\nIn Anatole France's \"The Seven Wives of Bluebeard\", Bluebeard is the victim of the tale, and his wives the perpetrators. Bluebeard is a generous, kind-hearted, wealthy nobleman called Bertrand de Montragoux who marries a succession of grotesque, adulterous, difficult, or simple-minded wives. His first six wives all die, flee, or are sent away under unfortunate circumstances, none of which are his fault. His seventh wife deceives him with another lover and murders him for his wealth.\n\nIn Angela Carter's The Bloody Chamber, Bluebeard is a 1920s decadent with a collection of erotic drawings, and Bluebeard's's wife is rescued by her mother who rides in on a horse and shoots Bluebeard between the eyes, rather than by her brothers as in the original fairy tale.\n\nIn Joyce Carol Oates' short story, \"Blue-Bearded Lover\", the most recent wife is well aware of Bluebeard's murdered wives: she does not unlock the door to the forbidden room, and therefore avoids death herself. She remains with Bluebeard despite knowing he is a murderer, and gives birth to Bluebeard's children. The book has been interpreted as a feminist struggle for sexual power.\n\nIn Helen Oyeyemi's \"Mr. Fox\", Mr. Fox is a writer of slasher novels, engaged to a woman named Mary. Mary's father scared her as a little girl by telling her of all the women that were killed by disobeying men. Mary questions Mr. Fox about why he writes about killing women who have transgressed patriarchal laws, making him aware of how his words normalize domestic violence.\n\nKurt Vonnegut's \"Bluebeard\" features a painter who calls himself Bluebeard, and who considers his art studio to be a forbidden chamber where his girlfriend Circe Berman is not allowed to go.\n\nIn Donald Barthelme's \"Bluebeard\", the wife believes that the carcasses of Bluebeard's previous six wives are behind the door. She loses the key and her lover hides the three duplicates. One afternoon Bluebeard insists that she open the door, so she borrows his key. Inside, she finds the decaying carcasses of six zebras dressed in Coco Chanel gowns.\n\n\n\nSeveral film versions of the story were made:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Alternatively, it has been used to describe the ideological-aesthetic aspect of contemporary corporate capitalism in the West. When used in this way, it is a play on the term \"socialist realism\".\n\nAlthough attested earlier, the phrase \"capitalist realism\" was first used in the title of the 1963 art exhibition in Düsseldorf, \"Demonstration for Capitalist Realism\", which featured the work of Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, Wolf Vostell, and . The exhibition's participants focused upon depictions of Germany's growing consumer culture and media-saturated society with strategies, in part, influenced by those of their American Pop counterparts. The recent rise in Pop Art in German culture was coupled by a fascination with America, which served as a stimulation for the piece. They were inspired primarily by the iconography depicted in newspapers and magazines.\n\nCapitalist realism is a German art movement co-founded in 1963 by artist Sigmar Polke. Polke embraced the advertising and publicity commonly found in the popular press in renderings of everyday consumer items. Often ironic and with critical overtones of society and politics the Capitalist Realism movement is considered more explicitly political than conventional Pop Art.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Michael Schudson used the term \"capitalist realism\" to describe mainstream practices in advertising. Chapter seven of Schudson's \"Advertising: The Uneasy Persuasion\" compares the messages and appeals of advertising to those found in the Socialist Realism of the Soviet Union. In his account, the realism of advertising promotes a way of life based on private consumption, rather than social, public achievement.\n\nThe term next appeared in 2009 with the publication of Mark Fisher's book \"\" Fisher argues that the term \"capitalist realism\" best describes the current global political situation, which lacks visible alternatives to the capitalist system which became dominant following the fall of the Soviet Union. His argument is a response to, and critique of, neo-liberalism and new forms of government which apply the logic of capitalism and the market to all aspects of governance.\n\nHis ideology refers to a perceived \"widespread sense that not only is capitalism the only viable political and economic system, but also that it is now impossible even to imagine a coherent alternative to it\". \n\nAs a philosophical concept, capitalist realism is influenced by the Althusserian conception of ideology. Fisher proposes that within a capitalist framework there is no space to conceive of alternative forms of social structures, adding that younger generations are not even concerned with recognizing alternatives. He proposes that the 2008 financial crisis compounded this position. Rather than catalyzing a desire to seek alternatives for the existing model, the crisis reinforced the notion that modifications must be made within the existing system. The crash confirmed within the populace the necessity of capitalism rather than shake it loose from its foundations.\n\n\"Capitalist realism as I understand it cannot be confined to art or to the quasi-propagandistic way in which advertising functions. It is more like a pervasive atmosphere, conditioning not only the production of culture but also the regulation of work and education, and acting as a kind of invisible barrier constraining thought and action.\"\n\nFisher argues that capitalist realism has propagated a 'business ontology' which concludes that everything should be run as a business including education and healthcare.\n\nFollowing the publication of Fisher's work, the term has been picked up by other literary critics.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "28351841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28351841", "title": "Carl Joachim Hambro (philologist)", "text": "Carl Joachim Hambro (philologist)\n\nCarl Joachim Hambro (7 June 1914 – 19 February 1985) was a Norwegian novelist, journalist, essayist, translator and Romance philologist. The son of the Conservative politician C. J. Hambro, he embarked on a philological career, graduating in 1939. During the Second World War he taught at Oslo Commerce School and the Norwegian College in Uppsala. After the war, he taught Norwegian at Sorbonne, whilst also working as Paris correspondent for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and a few Norwegian daily newspapers.\n\nBorn into a well-read and educated family, Hambro developed a penchant for French literature, marking an incongruity to the literary taste of his parents—they had been readers of English literature in the Anglo-American tradition. Making his debut in 1960 with the satirical novel \"De frafalnes klubb\", Hambro published trilogies and other novels for the next two decades. He had a keen interest in linguistics; in the 1969 book \"Ting, tanke, tale\" he problematized linguistic questions in a popular scientific way. A translator of French literature, he chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators in the early 1960s.\n\nHambro was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), capital of Norway. He was the third of four sons born to Carl Joachim Hambro (1885–1964), the President of Parliament and long-time leader of the Conservative Party, and his first wife, Gudrun \"Dudu\" Grieg (1881–1943). On the younger Carl Joachim's date of birth, 7 June 1914, his father, for whom he was named, made a speech at the Jubilee Exhibition in the Frogner Park, which commemorated the 1814 constitution. The twins Edvard and Cato were Carl's elder brothers, who both made success within the Anglosphere: the former became the 25th President of the United Nations General Assembly and a respected legal scholar, whilst the latter became board member of the World Federation for Mental Health. The younger brother, Johan, was secretary general of the Norse Federation for 27 years in the post-war period, yet is remembered above all for his commercially successful biography of their father. Living in the Uranienborg neighbourhood of Western Oslo, the Hambro family belonged to the upper-class society of early 20th-century Norway, and was, according to biographer Tormod Petter Svennevig, intellectually engaged; its forebears included both businesspeople and women's rights activists, of whom many were active in politics.\n\nThe younger Carl Hambro was educated at Fagerborg Upper Secondary School, whence he graduated in 1932, following Latin studies. Amongst his school contemporaries were Niels Christian Brøgger, who became an essayist and novelist, and Kaare Martin, a future Nazi politician.\n\nHaving made study trips to London and Paris in the mid-1930s, Hambro graduated with a cand.philol. degree in 1939. In the summer of that year, on 15 July, he married Wenche Rynning-Koren (born 1916). Upon the outbreak of war, he was employed at the Oslo Commerce School, where he lectured until 1943. Hambro spent the latter part of the war in Uppsala, Sweden, where he taught at the Norwegian College and chaired the local Norwegian Society (1943–1944). After the war he returned to Oslo, teaching at the Commerce School until 1946. He had lectured in French literature at the Norwegian Library College in two spells, during and after the war: from 1940 to 1941 and from 1945 to 1946. For the rest of the decade he taught Norwegian at Sorbonne, France. He also worked as a correspondent for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (1946–1948), \"Dagbladet\" (1946–1948), \"Verdens Gang\" (1948–1949) and \"Arbeiderbladet\" (1949–1951). From 1951 to 1952 he was a press worker for the Research Councils in Norway and for the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations. In that decade he mainly acted as cultural counsellor at the Norwegian embassy in London. Employed in 1952, he acted in that position for seven years, whereupon he returned to Oslo. He was assistant teacher in French at the University of Oslo from 1963 to 1965; in that position he bemoaned the compentence of his students in their own mother tongue, maintaining that the Norwegian language should be used more in foreign-language education.\n\nHambro made his literary debut in 1958 with the non-fiction book \"Frankrike\" (\"France\"), and released his first novel two years later. The novel, entitled \"De frafalnes klubb\" (\"The Club of the Estranged\"), was favourably commented upon by contemporary critics, but failed to arouse much subsequent interest from scholars. Hambro's reputation as a novelist rests more on his trilogy about the fictional character Nico Dietmeyer, deemed a \"Bildungsroman\" by academics. That work, serialised in the 1960s, was Hambro's first major commercial success, and has been reviewed in detail both by contemporaneous commentators and modern literary scholars. After a few unsuccessful novels in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Hambro turned his writings towards non-fiction, especially focusing on linguistics and politics, fields of interest that he had inherited from his father, who became fascinated by Sanskrit and East Asian poetry during his philology studies. The younger Hambro's most well-known and successful book within linguistics was the 1969 \"Ting, tanke, tale\" (\"Thing, Thought, Speech\"), followed by \"Språket i funksjon\" (\"Language in Operation\") in 1972.\n\nHaving divorced Rynning Koren, Hambro eventually married Christine Holter (born 1931). One of his wives bore him the daughter Ellen Hambro, who would later become director of Norway's Climate and Pollution Agency. Carl Joachim Hambro died on 19 February 1985 and was buried in Grefsen. Hambro's obituarist Finn Jor described him as a man fond of debate with a keen interest in societal issues, yet who was no front person in public dialogue, not possessing the eloquence of his father.\n\nIn 1958, Hambro released a non-fiction book titled \"Frankrike\" (), as a tribute to the country where he had spent most of his early adulthood. His love for France was not inherited from his parents, however: the elder Carl Joachim and Dudu were fervent anglophiles, the former having both written and translated English-language works, and the latter having been a voracious reader of Anglo-American novelists ranging from Rudyard Kipling to Aldous Huxley.\n\nHis debut novel, the satirical \"De frafalnes klubb\", was published in 1960. It tells a story of some disillusioned cynics in Paris who create a new philosophical and literary \"-ism,\" which gains worldwide popularity. According to reviewer Brikt Jensen, Hambro offered a critique of \"the modern type of man [who embraces] the first philosophical system that comes to his sight.\" Jensen also commended Hambro for his \"un-Norwegian\" perspective, calling him a \"distinguished European.\" The literary scholar Willy Dahl opined that the novel denoted Hambro's declared scepticism towards \"every sort of intellectual or political pigeonholing,\" a scepticism that he shared with his father C. J. Hambro, whose disdain for radical and totalitarian ideologies was well known. The elder Hambro was also, according to literary scholar Per Thomas Andersen, vital for the next literary work of the younger Hambro: he provided biographical context for a trilogy comprising the novels \"Frels oss fra det gode\" (1963; \"Deliver us from the good\"), \"Utfor stryket\" (1964; \"Down the River\") and \"Vi vil oss en drøm\" (1966; \"We Want a Dream\"), which describe the adolescence of a young man named Nico Dietmeyer. Living in the upper-class society of Western Oslo in the 1930s, Dietmeyer has an authoritarian father who commits adultery, despite emphasising \"decorum\" in his own moral system. The first of them was favourably reviewed by Brikt Jensen in \"Verdens Gang\", who called it \"a declaration of love for Oslo\"; reviewing for the same newspaper, Ragnhild Lorentzen gave the next novel a laudatory review, praising Hambro for having taken an important task upon his shoulders, whilst also criticising him for blurring the line between adolescence and adulthood. Dahl argues that these novels constitute an unpretentious, yet perspicacious criticism of conformity in that milieu, whilst Andersen considers them to be stories about double standards and liberation from one's own father. Rottem maintains that the novel is self-biographic, and that Hambro tries to polemize against the extramarital relationship that his father had with actress Gyda Christensen. 1966 proved to be a productive year for Hambro: he first contributed to the semi-pornographic literary collection \"Norske sengehester\" (\"Norwegian Bedposts\"), and subsequently, in September, delivered a vehement critique of the Norwegian education system in the pamphlet \"Er gymnasiaster mennesker?\". The last novel of his trilogy about Nico Dietmeyer was released in November of the same year; Lorentzen considered the first part of the book to be somewhat verbose and anticipative, concluding her review by calling the novel an unoriginal yet well written book. In 1967 Hambro continued with \"Bjørnen sover\" (\"The Bear Is Sleeping\"), a marriage novel that disappointed the critics, before releasing his semantic and psycholinguistic study \"Ting, tanke, tale\" in 1969. The journalist Iver Tore Svenning recognized that work as one of the very few successful attempts at a popular scientific treatment of structural linguistics, a view supported by Dahl. Hambro's last novels were \"Nødhavn\" (\"Harbour of Refuge\") and \"Lekkasje\" (\"Leakage\"), released in 1971 and 1974. The former book is about a love affair between an erstwhile cultural radical and a young woman with aggressive political opinions. The affair makes, according to Dahl, the cultural radical think about his nonconformist past, yet he abandons it, and seeks safety in the bourgeoisie class.\n\nHe nevertheless continued to write, albeit in the non-fiction genre: in the 1970s he penned numerous articles on political and literary topics for Norwegian newspapers and periodicals. He especially contributed to the periodicals \"Vinduet\" and \"Samtiden\". In 1972 he resumed his endeavour to popularise linguistics: together with Erik Rudeng and Knut Svortdal he released \"Språket i funksjon\" (\"Language in Operation\"), an introductory book to improve language comprehension and essay writing. Rudeng later recalled that it cited philosophers and linguists hitherto unknown in Norwegian public discourse, amongst them Michel Foucault (1926–1984). In the latter part of his life Hambro wrote books on the Norwegian authors Jens Bjørneboe and Arnulf Øverland; he also compiled a collection of the latter's poems. He was active in the Norwegian Authors' Union, becoming known as \"a man of compromises\" after having calmed a linguistic debate in the union. He also sought to relax the membership criteria, so that non-fiction authors also could become members, but to no avail. Yet, the Norwegian Non-fiction Writers Association was established in 1978. Hambro's good reputation dwindled with the years, especially following his vehement defence of the writers Agnar Mykle and Bjørneboe, who had been brought to justice for their pornographic novels.\n\nHambro also translated the works of others, mostly French and English authors, amongst them the philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, the French novelist Jacques de Lacretelle, the Canadian-American novelist Saul Bellow, the Irish playwright Samuel Beckett, the Northern Irish novelist Brian Moore, the Hungarian-British author Arthur Koestler, and the British novelist William Golding. In 1963 he was rewarded the Bastian Prize for his translation of Claude Simon's \"The Flanders Road\". He chaired the Norwegian Association of Literary Translators from 1961 to 1965.\n"}

It was built on the supposed resting place of Mary on the road to Bethlehem mentioned in the Proto-Gospel of James. The church was built when Marian devotion first rose to great importance, following the Council of Ephesus of 431. It is the first church known to have been dedicated to the Theotokos (Mary the God-bearer) in the entire Byzantine Empire.\n\nIts remains were discovered accidentally during construction work of Highway 60 in 1992 near Mar Elias Monastery. The course of the highway was shifted to avoid damage to the site, so that the ruins are now just off the road, at the municipal border between Jerusalem and Bethlehem. \nThe site was excavated in 1997.\n\nArchaeological excavations revealed a large church, originally built in the 5th century and restored in the 6th.\nIt was turned into a mosque in the 8th century, and destroyed shortly after.\n\nThe building had an octagonal floor plan measuring 43 m x 52 m, comparable to that of the 4th-century Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and other Byzantine churches, imitated in the construction of the Muslim Dome of the Rock in the late 7th century. Most of the rooms of the church were paved in coloured mosaics of floral and geometric designs, some of them added in the 8th century.\n\nThe 6th-century \"De Situ Terrae Sanctae\" claims that the influential Byzantine court official Urbicius had the rock cut into rectangular shape, like an altar, and intended to have it moved to Constantinople, but no-one was able to move it.\n\nThe church is mentioned in a 6th-century \"Life\" of Theodosius the Cenobiarch. According to this text, both the church and the monastery of Kathisma were built by a wealthy widow called Ikelia (\"Iqilia, Hicelia\") during the reign of bishop Juvenal of Jerusalem (r. 450–458). Theodosius is said to have lived in the monastery as a young monk.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40929586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40929586", "title": "Cognitive sociolinguistics", "text": "Cognitive sociolinguistics\n\nCognitive Sociolinguistics is an emerging field of linguistics that aims to account for linguistic variation in social settings with a cognitive explanatory framework. The goal of cognitive sociolinguists is to build a mental model of society, individuals, institutions and their relations to one another. Cognitive sociolinguists also strive to combine theories and methods used in cognitive linguistics and sociolinguistics so as to provide a more productive framework for future research on language variation. This burgeoning field concerning social implications on cognitive linguistics has yet received universal recognition.\n\nCognitive sociolinguistics understands how social meaning is transmitted and changed, all with a mental model framework.\nThis notion was first formally introduced as an independent field of research by Gitte Kristiansen and Rene Dirven. Later, Dirk Geeraers, an advocate of cognitive sociolinguistics, identified the field of investigation in three areas: behavior, attitudes, and evolution. Behavior seeks to understand socially structured variation in actual language use, while attitude attempts to understand how variation is perceived by speakers.\nIn response to some criticism to this emerging field, he argues that the combination of cognition and sociolinguistics is relevant and important to our understanding of language because many aspects of language, such as allophones and phonemes, convey social meaning. Furthermore, meaning is also conveyed by the categorization of social groups and social stereotyping, all of which stem from a mental model.\n\nThe following theories are respectively tied to: 1. the concerns of cognitive linguistics, a semantic perspective and usage-based nature; 2. the tradition of sociolinguistics which describes the socially interactive nature of linguistic communication. The theories serve to lay bare the two distinct linguistic fields and introduce the need for a combination of the two—a cognitive sociolinguistic perspective.\n\n\nDifferent from the view of language being abstractly stored in human minds, usage-based variation is a result of phonological, morphosyntactic, semantic, and discourse-functional factors. The Processing Hypothesis of online speech states that when an individual is processing a statement in their minds, they will choose the participle placement that will require less processing effort. \"For most variables, this means that the erg particle will precede the direct object when the direct object requires a lot of processing effort, whereas the verb particle will follow the direct object when the latter requires little processing effort.\" He thought up a new and complicated theory of syntactic change.\nIn the case above, it is more natural to say the first sentence which results in the particle coming before the direct object because it is complex and requires more processing effort.\n\nIn the Dutch language, adjunct-initial presentatives do not require the particle \"er\" in the post-verbal position. For example,\nGrondelaers interprets the function of \"er\" in adjunct-initial preventatives in the light of Langacker's reference point theory. His results from the data suggest the presence of \"er\" reflects how well the initial adjunct and the verb serve as a reference point to situate the subject referent. \"With the insertion of \"er\", the speaker signals that the hearer cannot situate the subject referent very well on the basis of the adjunct and the verb, thus preparing the hearer for a subject that will require a lot of processing.\" \n\nA case study was conducted to show the benefits of cognitive sociolinguistic approach in investigating lexical polysemy (Robinson 2010). The advantage of such an approach was exemplified in people's different #usage-based variations in conceptualizations of the adjective \"awesome\".\n\nIn the study, 72 English speakers were interviewed. They were locally born in South Yorkshire and ranged from age 11 to 92. To get the usage-based meanings of awesome, people were asked “who or what is awesome?” and after the volunteer's answer, a second question is posed, “why is ___ awesome?” Then, the response to that question shows the volunteer's usage-based conception of awesome.\n\nThe results analyzed in a cognitive semantics fashion confirms that awesome is a clustered with overlapping senses such as “great” “impressive” and “terrible”, as shown in the graph on the right. However, such analysis is sufficient only when the community is homogenous. Additionally, it is hard to observe patterns of language change and tendencies of usage. Sociolinguistic approach is, therefore, needed for a more thorough analysis of the data. Traditional sociolinguistic parameters—age, gender, socio-economic status—are taken into consideration. Figure 2 is a graph showing the usage of awesome in the context of age. It shows ploysemous flexibility: not every meaning is equally representative within a polysemous category; not every meaning is equally salient for every speaker, even within the same speech community, which is important in the context of the value of socio-cognitive research. It extends the prototypical nature of meaning to (Rosch 1975, Geeraerts 1989) . It proposes methods towards usage-based concepts rather than abstract ones because each person's experiences in the worlds shape their understandings differently.\n\nThere is a clear pattern when we map the cognitive semantic analysis (as in Figure 1) onto the sociolinguistic analysis (as in Figure 2), that the use of the adjective is related to the speakers' age. Further, in the cognitive sociolinguistic fashioned analysis of external factors, there emerges a need of building a multifactorial statistical model. It measures the effect of multiple factors on the use of the senses of awesome at the same time. (In this case, the researchers employed logistic regression analysis, considering age group, gender, education, occupation and neighborhood environment.)\nThis process of building a model to figure out what happens—how different factors contribute—to each individual (group) is an embodiment of the cognitive sociolinguistic approach of analysis.\n\nLogistic regression analysis evidences the use of awesome 'great' can be modeled from the age and gender of speakers, with age having a more significant overall effect than gender; awesome 'impressive' can be modeled from age, gender and potentially their living environment; no prediction can be made regarding the overall effect of external factors on the use of the meaning 'terrible'.\n\nAge being significant in most variation, therefore, indicates the semantic change based on the apparent time construct. This is not novel to sociolinguistics, as Labov's (1963) Martha's Vineyard study was the pioneer work in this area. In the awesome study, as well, real-time evidence (from the Oxford English Dictionary Online, for example,) proves the semantic change interpreted from the case study, that “great” is becoming the core meaning of awesome, and that “terrible” is archaic since it is only active in older members. Based on the cognitive sociolinguistic approach, the overlapping of senses shows diachronic succession (e.g. awesome 'terrible' > 'impressive' > 'great', with 'impressive' as a neutral transition, as opposed to 'terrible' > 'great' ). Additionally, the overlapping readings only occur “as expected” (e.g. the archaic sense of awesome 'terrible' occurs in the adjacent younger generation of its users—age 60 and up, not to the youngest generations.)\nSocio-cognitive analysis also helps us identify the responsible speakers for innovation as well as speakers who resist innovation: in this case, the age group of 31-60 first started using the sense “great”, and people over 60 are resisting the innovation since some are still using the oldest sense “terrible”.\n\nThe socio-cognitive analysis, as an interdisciplinary perspective, serves to present the systematic relationship between the semantic category fluctuations and the socio-demography of a community. The observations in the case study above contribute to validate the socio-cognitive field. As shown above, it organizes a “conceptual mess” and interpret it in a variationist framework. The complex cognitive polyemy forms regular patterns once it was mapped on the socio-demography of the community. The cognitive sociolinguistic approach, therefore, brings solutions to language research at a methodological and an analytical level (Robinson 2010).\n\nThe Rationalist Model of Language sees language as a logical item. It states that language is strictly a means of communication, an act of social participation, and language variation as an obstacle to emancipation. The Romantic Model of Language understands language as a means of human expression of themselves and their identities. Language variation, according to this model, is also a means to express social exclusion.\n\nCultural cognition has two integral aspects—conceptualization and language.\nLexical, morpho-syntactic and pragmatic differences cross-linguistically or cross-dialectally are often motivated by conceptualizations which manifest cultural norms, knowledge and experiences in history\n\nEven though it is the individual mind that is responsible for the connection of the two, the ultimate level of cultural cognition is not fixed representations in each member’s mind, but, at an emergent level, is the properties which arise from interactions among members of a cultural group or a speech community.\nThe oval section is a representation of cultural cognition on the emergent level. The cognition emerges from the interactions among members of the same group. They may share part of the elements of the collective cultural cognition, as seen in the lower section which reflects the heterogeneous distribution of cultural cognition across individuals’ minds. This is a more dynamic fluid view that goes beyond the individual level of mind and counters the essentialist views of culture.\n\nCultural models comprises a network of categories, schemas and metaphors:\n\n\nA Rationalist Model: Aboriginal English in Australia\n\nAboriginal English is a mixture of Australian indigenous languages and Anglo-Australian English. Studies have shown that the educational systems in Australia subscribe to the rationalist model by promoting the learning of Standard Australian English as the key to success in their society. As a result, there has been miscommunication in school settings, where teachers approach to aboriginal students with a standardization mindset. However, cognitive sociolinguists’ effort in this is to present the specific schemas and underlying cultural conceptualizations to account for linguistic differences between the two dialects.\n\nIn the study, both the Aboriginal Australian and the Anglo-Australian students were asked to elaborate on the give stimuli word \"home\". Aboriginal children associated \"home\" with members of their extended family, family obligations, without much limit of time and space. However, the Anglo-Australian children referred to physical buildings and commodities (e.g. TV) as their \"home\". The lexical difference resides in the conceptualization difference between the two cultural groups, where Aboriginal people’s conceptualizations profile the company of the extended family as opposed to the Anglo-Australian sense of \"home\" that is usually a building and its contents, bound by space and time.\n\nThe study posed implications for improvement of the educational system in Australia. This cognitive sociolinguistic approach brings forth the conflict between the two cultural models—rationalist and romantic, and serves to potentially solve the social problem in a community.\n\nA Romantic Model: Chinese English\n\nInstitutionalized second language varieties of English demonstrate the phenomenon of language contact in that it displays the different embodiment of the same language in different speech communities. Instead of considering these varieties as non-standard and evasive, the cognitive sociolinguistic approach is to account for the motivation and underlying reason for the behavior differences in language (as opposed to the structuralists’ view in a Saussurian model where only the \"langue\", as a self-contained system, is of scientific interest). For example, In Chinese English, metaphorical expressions such as \"sons and daughters of the Chinese nation\", \"our cousins in Mainland China\" (used by people from Hong Kong) and \"big brother\" (referring to a recruiter or protector in a Chinese secret society) express the conceptualization \"the nation is a family\".\n\nSyntactically, there is construction grammar incorporating Chinese culture such as ancestral worship:\n\nIn the examples above, the ditransitive or double- object construction (offer somebody something) is here lexically realized by the culturally determined expressions burn somebody (a paper replica of) a villa, which is one of the mourning rituals for the spirits of the deceased.\n\nIn dealing with the World Englishes, the cognitive sociolinguistic approach is one that combines corpus linguistic methods these developed in conceptual metaphor theory and blending theory.\n\nThe use of language in politics, now and throughout history, plays a significant role in the development of many political issues, controversies, and conflicts. Essentialist and non-essentialist views of language play a crucial role in political discourse in that the definition of a word or concept may be understood as being either too broad or too narrow by one party or another.\n\nOne example of such a debacle is the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal of 1998, in which former United States President Bill Clinton was charged with having \"sexual relations\" with Monica Lewinsky. The definition of \"sexual relations\" was called into question as the term was ambiguous (i.e. whether \"oral sex\" should be included or excluded from the definition of \"sexual relations\"). The President denied the allegations on the grounds that the definition of \"sexual relations\" given in the legal deposition of the trial did not constitute \"oral sex\" on the person being deposed.)\n"}
{"id": "153433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153433", "title": "Concrete poetry", "text": "Concrete poetry\n\nConcrete, pattern, or shape poetry is an arrangement of linguistic elements in which the typographical effect is more important in conveying meaning than verbal significance. It is sometimes referred to as visual poetry, a term that has now developed a distinct meaning of its own. As such, concrete poetry relates more to the visual than to the verbal arts and there is a considerable overlap in the kind of product to which it refers. Historically, however, concrete poetry has developed from a long tradition of shaped poems in which the words are arranged in such a way as to depict their subject.\n\nThough the term ‘concrete poetry’ is modern, the idea of using letter arrangements to enhance the meaning of a poem is old. Such shaped poetry was popular in Greek Alexandria during the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE, although only the handful which were collected together in the Greek Anthology now survive. Examples include poems by Simmias of Rhodes in the shape of an egg, wings and a hatchet, as well as Theocritus’ pan-pipes.\n\nThe post-Classical revival of shaped poetry seems to begin with the \"Gerechtigkeitsspirale\" (spiral of justice), a relief carving of a poem at the pilgrimage church of St. Valentin in the German town of Hesse. The text is carved in the form of a spiral on the front of one of the church pews and is one of several decorative designs there created in 1510 by master carpenter .\nEarly religious examples of shaped poems in English include \"Easter Wings\" and \"The Altar\" in George Herbert’s \"The Temple\" (1633) and Robert Herrick’s \"This crosstree here\", which is set in the shape of a cross, from his \"Noble Numbers\" (1647). An alternative religious precursor is Micrography, a technique for creating visual images used by Hebrew artists, which involves organizing small arrangements of Biblical texts such that they form images which illustrate the subject of the text. Micrography allows the creation of images of natural objects by Jews without directly breaking the prohibition of creating \"graven images\" that might be interpreted as idolatry. The technique is now used by both religious and secular artists and is similar to the use of Arabic texts in Islamic calligraphy.\n\nEuropean secular examples include poems in the shape of wine flagons by Rabelais and Charles-François Panard, and the Slovene France Prešeren's \"A Toast\" (Zdravljica, 1844) with stanzas in the shape of wine-glasses. This approach was taken up at the start of the 20th century by Guillaume Apollinaire in his \"Calligrammes\" (1918), with poems in, among others, the shape of a necktie, a fountain and raindrops running down a window.\nIn that era also there were typographical experiments by members of avant-garde movements such as Futurism, Dada and Surrealism in which lay-out moved from an auxiliary expression of meaning to artistic primacy. Thus the significance of the sound poetry in Marinetti’s Zang Tumb Tumb (1912) is expressed through pictorial means. Similarly in Germany Raoul Hausmann claimed that the typographic style of his 'Phonemes' allowed the reader to recognise what sound was intended. In Russia the Futurist poet Vasily Kamensky went so far as to term the typography of his \"Tango with Cows\", published in 1914, 'ferro-concrete poems' (\"zhelezobetonnye poemy\"), long before the name became current elsewhere. \n\nA further move away from overt meaning occurred where ‘poems’ were simplified to a simple arrangement of the letters of the alphabet. Louis Aragon, for example, exhibited the sequence from a to z and titled it \"Suicide\" (1926), while Kurt Schwitters’ \"ZA (elementary)\" has the alphabet in reverse, and the Catalan writer Josep Maria Junoy (1885-1955) placed just the letters Z and A at the top and bottom of the page under the title \"Ars Poetica\".\n\nDuring the early 1950s two Brazilian artistic groups producing severely abstract and impersonal work were joined by poets linked to the São Paulo magazine \"Noigandres\" who began to treat language in an equally abstract way. Their work was termed \"concrete poetry\" after they exhibited along with the artists in the National Exhibition of Concrete Art (1956/57). The poets included Augusto de Campos, Haroldo de Campos and Décio Pignatari, who were joined in the exhibition by Ferreira Gullar, Ronaldo Azeredo and Wlademir Dias Pino from Rio de Janeiro. In 1958 a Brazilian concrete poetry manifesto was published and an anthology in 1962.\n\nHouédard claimed that it was the 1962 publication in \"The Times Literary Supplement\" of a letter from the Portuguese E.M. de Melo e Castro that awakened British writers such as himself, Ian Hamilton Finlay and Edwin Morgan to the possibilities of Concrete Poetry. However, there were by this time other European writers producing similar work, principally Eugen Gomringer, who considered that a poem should be \"a reality in itself\" rather than a statement about reality, and \"as easily understood as signs in airports and traffic signs\". The difficulty in defining such a style is admitted by Houédard’s statement that \"a printed concrete poem is ambiguously both typographic-poetry and poetic-typography\".\nAnother difficulty of definition is caused by the way such works cross artistic boundaries into the areas of music and sculpture, or can alternatively be defined as sound poetry, visual poetry, found poetry and typewriter art. Henri Chopin’s work was related to his musical treatment of the word. Kenelm Cox (1927-68) was a kinetic artist \"interested in the linear, serial aspects of visual experience but particularly in the process of change,\" whose revolving machines transcended the static page in being able to express this. Ian Hamilton Finlay’s concrete poetry began on the page but then moved increasingly towards three dimensional figuration and afterwards to site-specific art in the creation of his sculpture garden at Little Sparta. The Italian Maurizio Nannucci's \"Dattilogrammmi\" experiments (1964/1965) were also transitional, preluding his move into light art. \n\nBob Cobbing, who was also a sound poet, had been experimenting with typewriter and duplicator since 1942. Of its possibilities in suggesting the physical dimension of the auditory process, he declared that \"One can get the measure of a poem with the typewriter’s accurate left/right & up & down movements; but superimposition by means of stencil and duplicator enable one to dance to this measure.\" Houédard’s entirely different work was also produced principally on the typewriter but approximates more to painterly and sculptural procedures. So too does that of the American Minimalist artist Carl André, beginning from about 1958 and in parallel with his changing artistic procedures. And in Italy Adriano Spatola (1941-88) developed the artistic fragmentation of language using various visual techniques in his \"Zeroglifico\" (1965/6). \n\nEdwin Morgan’s experiments with concrete poetry covered several other aspects of it, including elements of found poetry ‘discovered’ by misreading and isolating elements from printed sources. \"Most people have probably had the experience of scanning a newspaper page quickly and taking a message from it quite different from the intended one. I began looking deliberately for such hidden messages…preferably with the visual or typographical element part of the point.\" Another aspect of the search for unintended concordances of meaning emerges in A Humument, the lifework of the visual artist Tom Phillips, who uses painterly and decorative procedures to isolate them on the page.\n\nDespite such blurring of artistic boundaries, concrete poetry can be viewed as taking its place in a predominantly visual tradition stretching over more than two millennia that seeks to draw attention to the word in the space of the page, and to the spaces between words, as an aid to emphasising their significance.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27619138", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27619138", "title": "Corporatism", "text": "Corporatism\n\nCorporatism is the organization of a society by corporate groups, such as agricultural, labour, military, scientific, or guild associations, on the basis of their common interests.\n\nIn 1881, Pope Leo XIII commissioned theologians and social thinkers to study corporatism and provide a definition for it. In 1884 in Freiburg, the commission declared that corporatism was a \"system of social organization that has at its base the grouping of men according to the community of their natural interests and social functions, and as true and proper organs of the state they direct and coordinate labor and capital in matters of common interest\". Corporatism is related to the sociological concept of structural functionalism. Corporatist ideas are common to ideologies including absolutism, fascism and liberalism.\n\nCorporatism may also refer to economic tripartism involving negotiations between business, labour and state interest groups to establish economic policy. This is sometimes also referred to as neo-corporatism and is associated with social democracy.\n\nKinship-based corporatism emphasizing clan, ethnic and family identification has been a common phenomenon in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Confucian societies based upon families and clans in East Asia and Southeast Asia have been considered types of corporatism. China has strong elements of clan corporatism in its society involving legal norms concerning family relations. Islamic societies often feature strong clans which form the basis for a community-based corporatist society. Family businesses are common worldwide in capitalist societies.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church sponsored the creation of various institutions including brotherhoods, monasteries, religious orders and military associations, especially during the Crusades, to sponsor association between these groups. In Italy, various function-based groups and institutions were created, including universities, guilds for artisans and craftspeople and other professional associations. The creation of the guild system is a particularly important aspect of the history of corporatism because it involved the allocation of power to regulate trade and prices to guilds, which is an important aspect of corporatist economic models of economic management and class collaboration.\n\nCorporatism's popularity increased in the late 19th century and a corporatist internationale was formed in 1890, followed by the publishing of \"Rerum novarum\" by the Catholic Church that for the first time declared the Church's blessing to trade unions and recommended for organized labour to be recognized by politicians. Many corporatist unions in Europe were endorsed by the Catholic Church to challenge the anarchist, Marxist and other radical unions, with the corporatist unions being fairly conservative in comparison to their radical rivals. Some Catholic corporatist states include Austria under the leadership of Federal Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss and Ecuador under the leadership of Garcia Moreno. The economic vision outlined in \"Rerum novarum\" and \"Quadragesimo anno\" also influenced the regime of Juan Perón and Justicialism. In response to the Roman Catholic corporatism of the 1890s, Protestant corporatism was developed, especially in Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. However, Protestant corporatism has been much less successful in obtaining assistance from governments than its Roman Catholic counterpart.\n\nIn social psychology and biology, researchers have found the presence of corporate group social organization amongst animal species. Research has shown that penguins are known to reside in densely populated corporate breeding colonies.\n\nAncient Greece developed early concepts of corporatism. Plato developed the concept of a totalitarian and communitarian corporatist system of natural-based classes and natural social hierarchies that would be organized based on function, such that groups would cooperate to achieve social harmony by emphasizing collective interests while rejecting individual interests.\n\nIn \"Politics\" , Aristotle also described society as being divided along natural classes and functional purposes that were priests, rulers, slaves and warriors. Ancient Rome adopted Greek concepts of corporatism into their own version of corporatism but also added the concept of political representation on the basis of function that divided representatives into military, professional and religious groups and created institutions for each group known as \"colegios\" (). See collegium (ancient Rome).\n\nAbsolute monarchies during the late Middle Ages gradually subordinated corporatist systems and corporate groups to the authority of centralized and absolutist governments, resulting in corporatism being used to enforce social hierarchy.\n\nAfter the French Revolution, the existing absolutist corporatist system was abolished due to its endorsement of social hierarchy and special \"corporate privilege\" for the Roman Catholic Church. The new French government considered corporatism's emphasis on group rights as inconsistent with the government's promotion of individual rights. Subsequently corporatist systems and corporate privilege throughout Europe were abolished in response to the French Revolution. From 1789 to the 1850s, most supporters of corporatism were reactionaries. A number of reactionary corporatists favoured corporatism in order to end liberal capitalism and restore the feudal system.\n\nFrom the 1850s onward, progressive corporatism developed in response to classical liberalism and Marxism. These corporatists supported providing group rights to members of the middle classes and working classes in order to secure cooperation among the classes. This was in opposition to the Marxist conception of class conflict. By the 1870s and 1880s, corporatism experienced a revival in Europe with the creation of workers' unions that were committed to negotiations with employers.\n\nIn his work \"Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft\" (\"Community and Society\") of 1887, Ferdinand Tönnies began a major revival of corporatist philosophy associated with the development of neo-medievalism and increased promotion of guild socialism and causing major changes of theoretical sociology. Tönnies claims that organic communities based upon clans, communes, families and professional groups are disrupted by the mechanical society of economic classes imposed by capitalism. The National Socialists used Tönnies' theory to promote their notion of \"Volksgemeinschaft\" (\"people's community\"). However, Tönnies opposed Nazism and joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1932 to oppose fascism in Germany and was deprived of his honorary professorship by Adolf Hitler in 1933.\n\nSociologist Émile Durkheim advocated a form of corporatism termed \"solidarism\" that advocated creating an organic social solidarity of society through functional representation. Solidarism was based upon Durkheim's view that the dynamic of human society as a collective is distinct from that of an individual, in that society is what places upon individuals their cultural and social attributes.\n\nDurkheim claimed that in the economy solidarism would alter the division of labour by changing it from the mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity. Durkheim claimed that the existing industrial capitalist division of labour caused \"juridical and moral \"anomie\"\" which had no norms or agreed procedures to resolve conflicts resulting in chronic confrontation between employers and trade unions. Durkheim believed that this anomie caused social dislocation and claimed that by this \"[i]t is the law of the strongest which rules, and there is inevitably a chronic state of war, latent or acute\". As a result, Durkheim claimed it is a moral obligation of the members of society to end this situation by creating a moral organic solidarity based upon professions as organized into a single public institution.\n\nThe idea of liberal corporatism has also been attributed to English liberal philosopher John Stuart Mill who discussed corporatist-like economic associations as needing to \"predominate\" in society to create equality for labourers and give them influence with management by economic democracy. Unlike some other types of corporatism, liberal corporatism does not reject capitalism or individualism, but believes that the capitalist companies are social institutions that should require their managers to do more than maximize net income by recognizing the needs of their employees.\n\nThis liberal corporatist ethic is similar to Taylorism, but endorses democratization of capitalist companies. Liberal corporatists believe that inclusion of all members in the election of management in effect reconciles \"ethics and efficiency, freedom and order, liberty and rationality\". Liberal corporatism began to gain disciples in the United States during the late 19th century.\n\nLiberal corporatism was an influential component of the progressivism in the United States that has been referred to as \"interest group liberalism\". In the United States, economic corporatism involving capital-labour cooperation was influential in the New Deal economic program of the United States in the 1930s as well as in Keynesianism and even Fordism.\n\nFascism's theory of economic corporatism involved management of sectors of the economy by government or privately-controlled organizations (corporations). Each trade union or employer corporation would theoretically represent its professional concerns, especially by negotiation of labour contracts and the like. It was theorized that this method could result in harmony amongst social classes. However, authors have noted that historically \"de facto\" economic corporatism was also used to reduce opposition and reward political loyalty.\n\nIn Italy from 1922 until 1943, corporatism became influential amongst Italian nationalists led by Benito Mussolini. The Charter of Carnaro gained much popularity as the prototype of a \"corporative state\", having displayed much within its tenets as a guild system combining the concepts of autonomy and authority in a special synthesis. Alfredo Rocco spoke of a corporative state and declared corporatist ideology in detail. Rocco would later become a member of the Italian fascist regime.\n\nItalian Fascism involved a corporatist political system in which the economy was collectively managed by employers, workers and state officials by formal mechanisms at the national level. It supporters claimed that corporatism could better recognize or \"incorporate\" every divergent interest into the state organically, unlike majority-rules democracy which they said could marginalize specific interests. This total consideration was the inspiration for their use of the term \"totalitarian\", described without coercion (which is connotated in the modern meaning) in the 1932 \"Doctrine of Fascism\" as thus: \nA popular slogan of the Italian Fascists under Mussolini was \"Tutto nello Stato, niente al di fuori dello Stato, nulla contro lo Stato\" (\"everything for the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state\").\n\nThis prospect of Italian fascist corporatism claimed to be the direct heir of Georges Sorel's revolutionary syndicalism, such that each interest was to form as its own entity with separate organizing parameters according to their own standards, but only within the corporative model of Italian fascism each was supposed to be incorporated through the auspices and organizing ability of a statist construct. This was by their reasoning the only possible way to achieve such a function, i.e. when resolved in the capability of an indissoluble state. Much of the corporatist influence upon Italian Fascism was partly due to the Fascists' attempts to gain endorsement by the Roman Catholic Church that itself sponsored corporatism.\n\nHowever, fascism's corporatism was a top-down model of state control over the economy while the Roman Catholic Church's corporatism favoured a bottom-up corporatism, whereby groups such as families and professional groups would voluntarily work together. The fascist state corporatism (of Roman Catholic Italy) influenced the governments and economies of a not only other Roman Catholic-majority countries, such as the governments of Engelbert Dollfuss in Austria and António de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal, but also Konstantin Päts and Kārlis Ulmanis in non-Catholic Estonia and Latvia. Fascists in non-Catholic countries also supported Italian Fascist corporatism, including Oswald Mosley of the British Union of Fascists, who commended corporatism and said that \"it means a nation organized as the human body, with each organ performing its individual function but working in harmony with the whole\". Mosley also considered corporatism as an attack on \"laissez-faire\" economics and \"international finance\".\n\nThe corporatist state Salazar established in Portugal was not associated with Mussolini—quite the opposite as he banished the fascist party in Portugal and distanced himself from all of Europe's fascist regimes. Portugal during Salazar's reign was considered Catholic corporatism. Portugal remained neutral throughout World War II. Salazar also had a strong dislike of Marxism and liberalism.\n\nIn 1933, Salazar stated: \"Our Dictatorship clearly resembles a fascist dictatorship in the reinforcement of authority, in the war declared against certain principles of democracy, in its accentuated nationalist character, in its preoccupation of social order. However, it differs from it in its process of renovation. The fascist dictatorship tends towards a pagan Caesarism, towards a state that knows no limits of a legal or moral order, which marches towards its goal without meeting complications or obstacles. The Portuguese New State, on the contrary, cannot avoid, not think of avoiding, certain limits of a moral order which it may consider indispensable to maintain in its favour of its reforming action\".\n\nDuring the post-World War II reconstruction period in Europe, corporatism was favoured by Christian democrats (often under the influence of Catholic social teaching), national conservatives and social democrats in opposition to liberal capitalism. This type of corporatism became unfashionable but revived again in the 1960s and 1970s as \"neo-corporatism\" in response to the new economic threat of recession-inflation.\n\nNeo-corporatism favoured economic tripartism which involved strong labour unions, employers' unions and governments that cooperated as \"social partners\" to negotiate and manage a national economy. Social corporatist systems instituted in Europe after World War II include the ordoliberal system of the social market economy in Germany, the social partnership in Ireland, the polder model in the Netherlands (although arguably the polder model already was present at the end of World War I, it was not until after World War II that a social service system gained foothold there), the concertation system in Italy, the Rhine model in Switzerland and the Benelux countries and the Nordic model in Scandinavia.\n\nAttempts in the United States to create neo-corporatist capital-labor arrangements were unsuccessfully advocated by Gary Hart and Michael Dukakis in the 1980s. As Secretary of Labor during the Clinton administration, Robert Reich promoted neo-corporatist reforms.\n\nChinese corporatism, as described by Jonathan Unger and Anita Chan in their essay \"China, Corporatism, and the East Asian Model\", is the following: [A]t the national level the state recognizes one and only one organization (say, a national labour union, a business association, a farmers' association) as the sole representative of the sectoral interests of the individuals, enterprises or institutions that comprise that organization's assigned constituency. The state determines which organizations will be recognized as legitimate and forms an unequal partnership of sorts with such organizations. The associations sometimes even get channelled into the policy-making processes and often help implement state policy on the government's behalf.\n\nBy establishing itself as the arbiter of legitimacy and assigning responsibility for a particular constituency with one sole organization, the state limits the number of players with which it must negotiate its policies and co-opts their leadership into policing their own members. This arrangement is not limited to economic organizations such as business groups and social organizations.\n\nThe use of corporatism as a framework to understand the central state's behaviour in China has been criticized by authors such as Bruce Gilley and William Hurst. Other scholars such as Jennifer Hsu and Reza Hasmath have argued the framework is still useful for analyzing China's local state behaviour and its engagement with social actors. Studying how the government engages with NGOs in particular has been a key part of the analysis of how local authorities in China have adapted and employed corporatist measures. Hsu and Hasmath argue that corporatist measures \"continue to be employed by local authorities as an effective means of ensuring the potency and relevance of the local state in a rapidly changing sector,\" while the state itself continues to retreat from the provision of welfare and social services. Local governments have adapted corporatist measures by \"utilizing subtle or tacit forms of approval\" to influence NGOs' operation. \n\nOn October 9, 2007, an article signed by Viktor Cherkesov, head of the Russian Drug Enforcement Administration, was published in \"Kommersant\", where he used the term \"corporativist state\" in a positive way to describe the evolution of Russia. He claimed that the administration officials detained on criminal charges earlier that month are the exception rather than the rule and that the only development scenario for Russia that is both realistic enough and relatively favorable is to continue evolution into a corporativist state ruled by security service officials.\n\nIn December 2005, Andrei Illarionov, former economic adviser to Vladimir Putin, claimed that Russia had become a corporativist state: The process of this state evolving into a new corporativist [\"sic\"] model reached its completion in 2005. [...] The strengthening of the corporativist state model and setting up favorable conditions for quasi-state monopolies by the state itself hurt the economy. ... Cabinet members or key Presidential Staff executives chairing corporation boards or serving on those boards are the order of the day in Russia. In what Western country—except in the corporativist state that lasted for 20 years in Italy—is such a phenomenon possible? Which, actually, proves that the term 'corporativist' properly applies to Russia today.\n\nAccording to some researchers, all political powers and most important economic assets in the country are controlled by former state security officials (\"siloviks\"). The takeover of Russian state and economic assets has been allegedly accomplished by a clique of Putin's close associates and friends who gradually became a leading group of Russian oligarchs and who \"seized control over the financial, media and administrative resources of the Russian state\" and restricted democratic freedoms and human rights\n\nIllarionov described the present situation in Russia as a new socio-political order, \"distinct from any seen in our country before\". In this model, members of the Corporation of Intelligence Service Collaborators (KSSS) took over the entire body of state power, follow an omerta-like behavior code and \"are given instruments conferring power over others – membership \"perks\", such as the right to carry and use weapons\". According to Illarionov, the \"Corporation has seized key government agencies – the Tax Service, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Parliament, and the government-controlled mass media – which are now used to advance the interests of KSSS members. Through these agencies, every significant resource of the country – security/intelligence, political, economic, informational and financial – is being monopolized in the hands of Corporation members\".\n\nAnalyst Andrei Piontkovsky also considers the present situation as \"the highest and culminating stage of bandit capitalism in Russia\". He believes that \"Russia is not corrupt. Corruption is what happens in all countries when businessmen offer officials large bribes for favors. Today’s Russia is unique. The businessmen, the politicians, and the bureaucrats are the same people\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1994, at age 17, Andrews was recruited to demonstrate and sell magic kits at a small magic shop at Tysons Corner Mall. The store relocated to Disney World within days of his hiring, and Andrews declined to move with the store. He accepted a box of used magic tricks as a severance package. Andrews later learned performance arts such as fire eating, escape artistry and sword swallowing.\n\nIn 1996 he traveled to Europe to work as a street performer. He made television appearances in several countries and performed as a part of Commedia dell'arte in Italy. While in Europe, Andrews picked up the idea of swallowing a curved blade from a performer named Wasp Boy at England’s Circus of Horrors.\n\nHe later returned to America, where he began performing at night clubs, corporate events, renaissance festivals, casinos and colleges. He was also a featured entertainer for Carnival Cruise Lines for six years.\n\nAndrews has performed on five continents in more than thirty countries. He has given numerous performances for television, Ripley’s Believe It or Not!

This record was certified as an official Guinness World Record in 2004.\n\nOfficial Guinness World Record Most Sword Swallowers Swallowing Swords Simultaneously\nOn Friday August 30, 2002 at the 2002 Sword Swallowers Convention in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania USA, 19 Sword Swallowers including Andrews, (who swallowed 11 at once) swallowed swords simultaneously. This record was certified as an official Guinness World Record in 2004.\n\nOfficial Guinness World Record Single Sword Swallowed by the Most Sword Swallowers\nMade by Thomas Blackthorne in 1994 to symbolize solidarity between an otherwise solitary and disparate sword-swallower community, the sword known as \"The Sword of Swords\" was first swallowed in September 2002 at the first Sword Swallowers Association International international Sword Swallower's Convention in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania USA, where Andrews along with 20 others swallowed the blade. Since then, the sword has since been swallowed by at least 24 others bringing the current total to 44. This record was certified as an official Guinness World Record in 2004.\n\nDai Andrews had made more than 50 television appearances worldwide including:\n\nHis appearances in print media include:\n\nIn 2007 Andrews worked alongside Dr. Sharon Caplan and other physicians at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore MD USA. The study was conducted to determine whether the techniques involved in sword swallowing could be used to help patients who suffer from achalasia or those who had suffered severe throat trauma and were having trouble swallowing as a result. The Fluoroscopic video, (Video x-ray) can be seen here.\n\nAndrews teaches the Xingyiquan style of Internal Kung Fu as well as traditional meditation techniques at a small studio in Baltimore, MD. He is the private student of Grandmaster Huang Chien Lang and has been studying Xingyiquan, Baguazhang, Tai Chi Chuan and Tien Shan Pai since 2000.

Patrick Johnson is the Carlos Montezuma Professor of Performance Studies and Professor of African-American Studies at Northwestern University. He currently serves as the Chair of the African-American Studies Department at Northwestern University and is a Visiting Scholar at the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. His scholarly and artistic contributions focus on Performance Studies, African-American Studies and Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies.\n\nBorn Elondust Patrick Johnson on March 1, 1967, the youngest of seven children in Hickory, North Carolina, Johnson was raised by his mother, Sarah M. Johnson, who worked as a factory worker. His mother reared him, along with his six siblings, in a one-bedroom apartment in Ridgeview, a majority-Black section of Hickory. Though she had only acquired a 10th grade education herself, Johnson's mother emphasized doing well in school, nurtured Johnson's creative talents early on and entered him in community talent shows. His first grade teacher, Beverly \"Bunny\" White, was instrumental in nurturing his creative and academic talents as well, by providing access to spaces that were closed to blacks and by providing financial support. He was also mentored by black women in the Ridgeview Community, including Z. Ann Hoyle, who became the first black alderman on the City of Hickory's city council. Hoyle would eventually spearhead a resolution to honor Johnson with his own day in 1996. He attended Hickory High School, where he was Senior Class President, and later the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. At UNC-Chapel Hill, Johnson was involved with a number of campus groups, including the Black Student Movement and the gospel choir. He entered college as a theater major, but after becoming a work-study student in the Speech Communications department, he switched his major. It was in that department that he was introduced to performance studies, oral history, and performance ethnography and influenced by his teachers and mentors D. Soyini Madison, Della Pollock, and Trudier Harris.\n\nJohnson received both his bachelor and master's degrees from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill in Speech Communications before completing his PhD in Speech Communications at Louisiana State University with certificates in English and Anthropology.\n\nAfter earning his PhD, Johnson became an Assistant Professor of English at Amherst College. In 2000, Johnson joined the faculty of the Department of Performance Studies Department at Northwestern University as an Assistant Professor before receiving tenure and a joint appointment in African-American Studies in 2003. From 2003–2006 and 2014–2016, Johnson served as the Director of Graduate Studies for the Department of Performance Studies. Later, he would also serve as the Chair of Performance Studies from 2006–2011. In 2007, Johnson was promoted to Full Professor of African-American Studies and Performance Studies before becoming the Carlos Montezuma Professor of African-American Studies and Performance Studies in 2011. He currently serves as the Chair of the African-American Studies Department.\n\nJohnson's introduction of \"quare\" as a theoretical concept became particularly influential in the fields of queer theory, women, gender and sexuality and black studies. Originally published in \"Text & Performance Quarterly\", \"Quare' Studies Or (Almost) Everything I Know About Queer Studies I Learned From My Grandmother\" went on to be reprinted numerous times. \"Quare\" signaled a significant departure from the lack of engagement with race and class by queer theorists and with gender and sexuality among black studies scholars.\n\nConceptually, \"Quare\" took seriously the lived experiences and knowledge of black queer people and such an understanding necessitated a shift toward enabling black queer people to articulate their own identities, knowledge and experiences. Further, the manner in which Johnson wrote the article blurs the line between art and scholarship as the article employs prose, poetry and theoretical ideas simultaneously. In 2000, Johnson convened the Black Queer Studies in the Millennium Conference which served as the beginning of black queer studies as a field.\n\nJohnson's first book, \"Appropriating Blackness: Performance and the Politics of Authenticity\", examines how blackness is appropriated and performed—toward widely divergent ends—both within and outside African American culture and won the Lilla A. Heston Award and the Errol Hill Award.\n\nHis second book, \"Sweet Tea: Black Gay Men of the South—An Oral History\" (2008) is an ethnographic oral history of the lives of black gay men in the US South, a traditionally uninterrogated region. This book was awarded the Stonewall Book Award Honor Book by the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Round Table of the American Library Association.\n\nPublished in 2005 with Mae G. Henderson, \"Black Queer Studies: A Critical Anthology\" interrogates the experiences of black queer people whose subjectivities, beliefs, struggles, triumphs and desires had not previously been interrogated by either Queer Theory or Black Studies. The anthology includes writings from scholars including Cathy Cohen, Kara Keeling, Roderick Ferguson, Rinaldo Walcott and Dwight McBride.\n\nPublished in 2014 with Ramon H. Rivera-Servera, \"solo/black/woman: scripts, interviews and essays\" is a collection of writings that feature seven solo performances by emerging and established feminist performance artists from the past three decades. The book received an Honorable Mention for the Errol Hill Book Award.\n\nIn 2013, Johnson published \"Cultural Struggles: Performance, Ethnography, Praxis\", an edited collection of essays written by Dwight Conquergood. Conquergood selected Johnson to publish his work before his death in 2004. Conquergood was an ethnographer in the field of performance studies whose ethnographic methods focused on power, privilege and researcher reflexivity/responsibility.\n\nPublished in 2016, \"No Tea, No Shade: New Writings in Black Queer Studies\" features the next generation of black queer theorists who follow in the lineage of writings in \"Black Queer Studies: A Critical Anthology\". The text was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award and features writings by Amber Jamilla Musser, Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley, Jafari Sinclaire Allen, Lyndon Gill and Marlon M. Bailey.\n\nPublished in 2016, \"Blacktino Queer Performance\" (with Ramon H. Rivera-Servera) is a collection of nine performance scripts by established and emerging black and Latina/o queer playwrights and performance artists. Each script is accompanied by an interview and critical essay by scholars across a range of interdisciplinary fields.\n\n\"Black. Queer. Southern. Women—An Oral History\" is a forthcoming text examining the experiences of black women who love other women and live in the US South. In this text, Johnson employed similar methods (ethnographic oral history) as he did in \"Sweet Tea\".\n\nInspired to present a more comprehensive version of \"Sweet Tea\" and the men that Johnson interviewed, in 2006 he created a solo Reader's Theater performance, called \"Pouring Tea: Black Gay Men of the South Tell Their Tales\", based on selected stories of the men that he interviewed. \"Pouring Tea\" toured across the country to over 100 universities, conferences and events over a decade. In 2010, in collaboration with Jane M. Saks, Columbia College and About Face Theatre Company in Chicago, Johnson developed the show into full production called \"Sweet Tea—The Play\". After its Chicago debut, the show traveled to Austin, Texas to the Warfield Center (2010), Signature Theater in Arlington, Virginia in 2011; Dixon Place in New York City (2012), the Durham Arts Council (2014), Rites and Reasons Theater in Providence, Rhode Island (2014), Towne Street Theater in Hollywood, California (2015), Northwestern University's Wirtz Center (2015), and to the National Black Theater Festival in Winston-Salem, NC (2015). Johnson won the Black Theater Alliance Bert Williams Award for Best Solo Performance for the show in 2010.\n\nThis forthcoming text is the creative nonfiction companion to \"Black. Queer. Southern. Women—An Oral History\" and the story is loosely based on women who participated in Johnson's study.\n\n\n\n\nJohnson has served on tenure and promotion evaluations, completed administrative service for Northwestern and served as an associate editor for publications including Text & Performance Quarterly, Sexualities, Cultural Studies and Gay & Lesbian Quarterly.\n\nHe is a member of several professional organizations including American Society for Theatre Research, American Studies Association, Association for Theatre in Higher Education, Cultural Studies Association, Mid America Theater Association, Modern Language Association, National Communication Association.\n\nJohnson has also served as convener for academic conferences including Black Queer Studies in the Millennium Conference, Black Feminist Performance, Creative Ethnography and Black Arts International: Temporalities and Territories.\n\nIn 1996 the Hickory City Council honored Johnson with his own day, citing his accomplishments as the first African American born and raised in Hickory to earn a PhD. In 2015, Johnson received the Oscar Brockett Award for Outstanding Teaching from the Association of Theatres in Higher Education. In 2010, Johnson was inducted into the Chicago Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Hall of Fame \"for his leadership in the African-American LGBT community.\"\n\nJohnson resides in Chicago with his partner Stephen J. Lewis, an Emmy Award-winning producer and manager in television and radio news.\n\n"}

She was just a toddler when her parents brought her in August 1963 to the March on Washington, site of Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous \"I Have A Dream\" speech. Alexander recalled that \"Politics was in the drinking water at my house\". She also took ballet as a child.\n\nShe was educated at Sidwell Friends School, and graduated in 1980. From there she went to Yale University and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1984. She studied poetry at Boston University under Derek Walcott and got her Master's in 1987. Her mother said to her, \"That poet you love, Derek Walcott, is teaching at Boston University. Why don't you apply?\" Alexander originally entered studying fiction writing, but Walcott looked at her diary and saw the poetry potential. Alexander said, \"He gave me a huge gift. He took a cluster of words and he lineated it. And I saw it.\"\n\nIn 1992, she received her PhD in English from the University of Pennsylvania. While she was finishing her degree, she taught at nearby Haverford College from 1990 to 1991. At this time, she would publish her first work, \"The Venus Hottentot\". The title comes from Sarah Baartman, a 19th-century South African woman of the Khoikhoi ethnic group. Elizabeth is an alumna of the Ragdale Foundation.\n\nWhile a graduate student, she was a reporter for the \"Washington Post\" from 1984 to 1985. She soon realized that \"it wasn't the life I wanted.\" She began teaching at University of Chicago in 1991 as an assistant professor of English. Here she would first meet future president Barack Obama, who was a senior lecturer at the school's law school from 1992 until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004. While in Chicago in 1992, she won a creative writing fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nIn 1996, she published a volume of poetry, \"Body of Life\" and a verse play, \"Diva Studies\", which was staged at Yale University. She also became a founding faculty member of the \"Cave Canem\" workshop which helps develop African-American poets. In 1997, she received the University of Chicago's Quantrell Award for excellence in undergraduate teaching. Later in that year, she moved to Massachusetts to teach at Smith College. She became the Grace Hazard Conkling poet-in-residence and the first director of the college's Poetry Center.\n\nIn 2000, she returned to Yale University, where she would teach African American studies and English. She also released her third poetry collection, \"Antebellum Dream Book\".\n\nIn 2005, she was selected in the first class of Alphonse Fletcher Foundation fellows and in 2007-08, she was an academic fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard.\n\nIn 2007, Alexander became the first recipient of the Jackson Poetry Prize, an annual prize awarded by Poets & Writers that \"honors an American poet of exceptional talent who deserves wider recognition.\"\n\nSince 2008, Alexander has chaired the African American Studies department at Yale. She currently teaches English language/literature, African-American literature and gender studies at Yale.\n\nIn 2015, Alexander was elected a Chancellor of the Academy of American Poets.\n\nIn 2016, she became the Wun Tsun Tam Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University.\n\nShe was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by Yale University in 2018.\n\nAlexander's poems, short stories and critical writings have been widely published in such journals and periodicals such as: \"The Paris Review,\" \"American Poetry Review,\" \"The Kenyon Review,\" \"The Village Voice,\" \"The Women's Review of Books,\" and \"The Washington Post.\" Her play \"Diva Studies\", which was performed at the Yale School of Drama, garnered her a National Endowment for the Arts creative writing fellowship as well as an Illinois Arts Council award.\n\nHer 2005 volume of poetry \"American Sublime\" was one of three finalists for the Pulitzer Prize of that year. Alexander is also a scholar of African-American literature and culture and recently published a collection of essays entitled \"The Black Interior.\"\n\nAlexander received the Anisfield-Wolf Book Award Lifetime Achievement Award in Poetry in 2010.\n\nOn January 20, 2009, at the presidential inauguration of Barack Obama, Alexander recited her poem \"Praise Song for the Day\", which she had composed for the occasion. She became only the fourth poet to read at an American presidential inauguration, after Robert Frost in 1961, Maya Angelou in 1993 and Miller Williams in 1997.\n\nThe announcement of her selection was favorably received by her fellow poets Maya Angelou, Rita Dove, Paul Muldoon, and Jay Parini, who extolled her as \"smart, deeply educated in the traditions of poetry, true to her roots, responsive to black culture.\" The Poetry Foundation also hailed the choice: \"Her selection affirms poetry's central place in the soul of our country.\"\n\nThough the selection of the widely unknown poet, who was a personal friend of Obama, was lauded, the actual poem and delivery were met with a poor reception. \"The Chicago Tribune\", the \"Los Angeles Times\" Book editor, and most critics found that \"her poem was too much like prose,\" and that \"her delivery [was] insufficiently dramatic.\" The \"Minneapolis Star-Tribune\" found the poem \"dull, 'bureaucratic' and found it proved that \"the poet's place is not on the platform but in the crowd, that she should speak not for the people but to them.\"\n\nAlexander wrote of her experience of reading at the inauguration in \"The New Yorker\" in January 2017. Alexander brought her father, who had attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, to sit next to her at the inauguration. At the rehearsal for the inauguration, Alexander read Gwendolyn Brooks's poem \"kitchenette building\".\n\nAccording to research done by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., of Harvard University, in 2010 for the PBS series \"Faces of America\", it was revealed that according to DNA analysis, she is a lineal cousin of another of the guests on the show, Stephen Colbert. Her paternal grandfather came to the United States in 1918 from Kingston, Jamaica. On the maternal side, her roots can be traced back 37 generations through notable ancestors, including her 23rd great-grandmother Joan, Princess of England, 24th great-grandparents King John I of England and Clemence, Mistress of the King, and 37th great-grandfather Charlemagne, first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. She was married to Ficre Ghebreyesus until his death in April 2012. She lives with their two sons in New York City.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "311130", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311130", "title": "Florianópolis", "text": "Florianópolis\n\nFlorianópolis () is the capital and second largest city of the state of Santa Catarina, in the South region of Brazil. The city encompasses Santa Catarina Island and surrounding small islands, as well as part of the mainland. It has a population of 477,798, according to the 2016 IBGE population estimate, the second most populous city in the state (after Joinville), and the 47th in Brazil. The metropolitan area has an estimated population of 1,111,702, the 21st largest in the country. The city is known for having the country's third highest Human Development Index score among all Brazilian cities (0.847). The city is considered safe by Brazilian standards. In 2014, Florianópolis had the second-lowest incidence of murders of Brazilian capitals.\n\nThe economy of Florianópolis is heavily based on information technology, tourism and services. The city has 60 beaches and is a center of surfing activity. Lagoa da Conceição is the most famous area for tourism, recreation, nature and radical sports. \"The New York Times\" reported that \"Florianopolis is the Party Destination of the Year in 2009.\" \"Newsweek\" placed Florianópolis in the \"Ten most dynamic cities of the world\" list in 2006. \"Veja\", a Brazilian publication, named the city as \"the best place to live in Brazil.\" As a result of this exposure, Florianópolis is growing as a second home destination for many Paulistas, Argentines, North Americans, and Europeans.\n\nMost of the population lives on the mainland and on the island's central and northern parts. The southern half is less inhabited. Many small commercial fishermen populate the island. The fishing boats, the lacemakers, the folklore, the cuisine and the colonial architecture contribute to the growing tourism and attracts resources that compensate for the lack of any large industry. Villages immersed in tradition and history, such as Santo Antônio de Lisboa and Ribeirão da Ilha still resist the advances of modernity.\n\nThe Hercílio Luz International Airport serves the city. Florianópolis is home to the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (Federal University of Santa Catarina). There are also the Santa Catarina Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology (Instituto Federal de Santa Catarina), and two campuses of the Universidade do Estado de Santa Catarina (State University of Santa Catarina), among other institutions of higher and professional education.\n\nThe name Florianópolis was meant to be a tribute to Marshal Floriano Peixoto, the second President (1891–1894) of the Republic of the United States of Brazil and from Greek term \"polis\", meaning \"city\". Until 1893, the city was called Nossa Senhora do Desterro (Our Lady of Banishment) or simply \"Desterro\".\n\nFlorianópolis has a native Atlantic Forest-type vegetation. This vegetation has an extremely diverse and unique mix of vegetation and forest types. The main ecoregion is the coastal Atlantic forest, the narrow strip of about 50–100 kilometers (31–62 miles) along the coast which covers about 20 percent of the region. This forests extend as far as 500–600 kilometers (310–372 miles) inland and its range is as high as 2,000 meters above sea level. Altitude determines at least three vegetation types in the Atlantic Forest: the lowland forest of the coastal plain, montane forests, and the high-altitude grassland or \"campo rupestre\".\n\nThe municipality contains part of the offshore Marinha do Arvoredo Biological Reserve, a fully protected conservation unit established in 1990.\nIt also contains part of the Serra do Tabuleiro State Park, a mountainous area covered in lush forests.\nThe park protects the sources of the Vargem do Braço, Cubatão and Una rivers, which supply most of the drinking water for greater Florianópolis and the south coast region.\nThe municipality contains the Rio Vermelho State Park in the northeast of Santa Catarina Island, created in 2007.\n\nThere is significant precipitation which is well distributed throughout the year. The annual normal precipitation for the period of 1961 through 1990 was . There is no dry season, and summer generally is the rainiest season. Increased rainfall occurs from January to March, with a median of per month, and from April to December there is somewhat less precipitation, averaging per month. The driest months are from June to August.\n\nFlorianópolis experiences a warm humid subtropical climate, falling just short of a true tropical climate. The seasons of the year are distinct, with a well-defined summer and winter, and characteristic weather for autumn and spring. Due to the proximity of the sea, the relative humidity of the atmosphere is 80% on average.\n\nThe maximum temperatures of the hottest month varies from to and the minimum temperatures are from to . The lowest temperature ever recorded was in September 1980 while the highest temperature ever recorded was in February 1973.\n\nCarijós Indians, a Tupi people, were the first inhabitants of Florianópolis area. The traces of its presence are verified through archaeological sites and sambaquis dating up to 4000 years ago. The Indians called the place Meiembipe or \"mountain along the channel\".\n\nAround 1514 the Portuguese landed and gave the area the name Ilha dos Patos, but in 1526 it was renamed Ilha de Santa Catarina (Saint Catherine Island). The area supplied the vessels that went to the River Plate (Río de la Plata) Basin.\n\nThe official settlement of the island began in 1673 with the arrival of bandeirante Francisco Dias Velho's agricultural company and it continued in 1678 with the construction of a chapel consecrated to Nossa Senhora do Desterro. At this time a villa began to take form, slowly becoming a colonial settlement.\n\nTo guarantee its domain the Portuguese Crown elevated Santa Catarina Island to the category of village in 1714 with the name of Nossa Senhora do Desterro and already in 1726 they promoted it again, now to the category of town.\n\nFrom this date on Vila do Desterro and mainly the port began to have a strategic function because it was situated halfway between Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires, possibly two of the largest seaside cities of South America at that time. For this reason in 1739 the Capitania da Ilha de Santa Catarina was created and Desterro became its capital. Soon the most expressive seaside defensive ring of Southern Brazil started to be built: Santa Cruz, São José da Ponta Grossa, Santo Antonio and Nossa Senhora da Conceição da Barra do Sul fortresses.\n\nWith the coming of the Captaincy the population began to grow, but the great population growth happened between 1747 and 1756 with the arrival of about 6,000 settlers coming from the Archipelago of Azores and from Madeira Island. The development of the agriculture, the cotton and linen industry and the commerce followed the Azorean occupation.\nIn 1823, during the monarchy which ended in 1889, Desterro became the Capital of Santa Catarina Province opening a period of prosperity with many urban works and also intense political organization.\n\nRegional elites not happy with the government centralization staged the Revolta Federalista (Federalist Revolt) at the beginning of the Brazilian Republic. The movement that started in Rio Grande do Sul spread to Santa Catarina and turned Desterro into the Federalist Capital of the Republic. The then president of Brazil, Marechal Floriano Peixoto, known as Iron Marshal, suppressed the rebellion and ordered the shooting of many people who were considered enemies of the state, in the Anhatomirim Island Fortress. Possibly to show loyalty to the marshal, 1893 saw the change of the state capital's name: from Desterro to Florianópolis, that is to say, city of Floriano.\n\nAccording to the IBGE of 2007, there were 406,564 people residing in the city (in 2010 IBGE reports a population of 421,203). The population density was . The last PNAD (National Research for Sample of Domiciles) census revealed the following numbers: 366,000 White people (90.0%), 37,000 Brown (Multiracial) people (9.0%), 4,000 Black people (1.0%), 400 Asian or Amerindian people (0.1%).\n\nFlorianópolis has a population mostly composed of Brazilians of European descent. The numbers of immigrants started to increase in the mid-18th century, mostly with the arrival of Portuguese colonists from the Azores Islands. The population of Florianópolis was composed mainly of Portuguese/Azoreans, Germans, and Italians. Further south, some neighborhoods preserve their rural village identity. The cultural heritage left by their Azorean ancestors is noticeable in their manner of speaking, in handicrafts, and traditional festivities.\n\nThe small village of Santo António de Lisboa (Saint Anthony of Lisbon) is an example of colonial period architecture and in Ribeirão da Ilha, the oldest part of the capital, the inhabitants still speak the Azorean dialect which is difficult to understand at first. In Ribeirão da Ilha is the church of Our Lady of Lapa do Ribeirão, built in 1806. Lagoa da Conceição, with its many sand dunes, restaurants and seaside night life and where women make lace to sell in the street, has also managed to retain many traces of its colonial architecture.\n\nOn the other side, the city has taken on a cosmopolitan air with the arrival of Brazilians from other states and foreigners who chose to live there. The island, which at the beginning of the colonization period, was an important whale hunting centre, is today a technological pole of the IT industry. A State Capital of interest to tourism, Florianópolis is currently inhabited by about 400,000 people. The metro area has about 980,000 people.\n\nAccording to 2002 Sefaz statistics, agricultural activities represented 0.05%, manufacturing represented 3.41% and the sector of the commerce and service 96.54%.\n\nTourism is one of the staples of Florianópolis' economy. Many inhabitants and tourists consider Floripa to have a singular beauty endowed with strong lines of Azorean culture, observed in the buildings, workmanship, folklore, culinary and religious traditions. Its environmental restrictions on building and commercial development have been more or less strictly enforced, helping it to keep its original character.\n\nBetween 1970 and 2004, Florianópolis's population tripled. But the local economy grew fivefold, and incomes grew in step. Opportunity seekers, urban and rural, white collar and blue, poured in. While many Brazilian cities are struggling to graduate from smokestacks to services, Florianópolis is succeeding. Thanks in part to a federal rule that for decades barred heavy industry on the island, town elders focused on cleaner public works which led to the founding of several public and private universities that make this one of the most scholarly cities in Brazil.\n\nTo meet the demands of its academic crowd, the city invested heavily in everything from roads to schools, and now Florianópolis ranks high on every development measure, from literacy (97 percent) to electrification (near 100 percent). By the late 1990s, private companies were flocking to the island, or emerging from a technology \"incubator\" at the federal university. (Among the innovations it hatched: the computerized voting machines that have made Brazilian elections fraud-free and efficient). Local officials now say their aim is to be the Silicon Valley of Brazil, with beaches.\n\nIn addition to its white sand beaches, Florianópolis offers many historical attractions, including the sites of the original Azorean colonists, the Lagoa da Conceição lagoon, and Santo Antônio de Lisboa. Tourism in Florianópolis has grown significantly over the past 10 years, with increasing numbers of visitors coming from other large cities in Brazil (particularly Porto Alegre, Curitiba, São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro) as well as other South American countries (particularly Argentina, with direct flights offered daily from Buenos Aires).\n\nDuring the past several years, a greater number of international tourists have also begun to frequent the island (particularly from Europe and the United States). As the number of visitors grows each year, Florianopolis faces the ongoing challenge of ensuring that its limited infrastructure and resources are updated to adequately accommodate them. Of particular concern are the sewers, which often drain directly into the ocean, polluting the very beaches that attract so many visitors.\n\nDuring the past decade technology and software development firms also experienced strong growth, and today Information Technology services are one of the top revenue generators in Florianópolis. Several technology centers are spread around Florianópolis, making the city an important pole in this economic sector.\n\nThe GDP for the city was R$6,259,393,000 (2005).\n\nThe per capita income for the city was R$15,776 (2005).\n\n\nThe Florianópolis high schools that obtained the best results on the 2007 Exame Nacional do Ensino Médio (National High School Exam) are Escola Autonomia, Colégio da Lagoa, Colégio Energia, Colégio Tendência, Colégio Expoente, Colégio Adventista de Florianópolis, Colégio Geração, Colégio de Aplicação UFSC, EEB Feliciano Nunes Pires, IFSC, Colégio Decisão, EEB Professor AníbalNunes Pires, Instituto Estadual de Educação, EEB Osmar Cunha, EEb Getúlio Vargas, EEB Presidente Roosevelt, EEB Professor Henrique Stodieck.\n\nFlorianópolis is one of the most visited places in Brazil as it is an island with 42 beaches, lagoons and waterfalls.\n\nLagoa da Conceição (Lagoon of Conceição) is the largest lagoon on the island of Florianopolis ( and one of the most visited area of the island by foreign travelers and backpackers. The area has the highest concentration of restaurants, bars, organic markets and shops. Many expats and Brazilian people from other cities choose to live by the lagoon because of its stunning views, safety, nature and quality of life.\n\nThe lagoon is surrounded by mountains and has a canal linking to the ocean. The history of the region around the lagoon is a plus with all the folklore, netting tradition, old Portuguese architecture, graffiti, and an 18th-century church on the top of the hill. See panoramic view below.\n\nThe Holy Spirit Feast (\"Festa do Divino\") is a festival that takes place 40 days after Easter. The celebration dates to the colonial era and includes a parade, music, and street food.\n\nPraia Mole (Mole Beach)\nOne of the most famous beaches is Praia Mole, close to the Lagoon of Conceição and noted for its rolling green hills and rock formations on either side. The beach is mostly known for surfing, eco-friendly lounges and LGBTQ scene during the summer. The beach is one of the locations for the ASP World Tour of the Association of Surfing Professionals, which classifies 50 competitors, among professionals and amateurs. The state of Santa Caterina is the only location in South America for this surfing event.. Santa Catarina Art Museum is located in the city.\n\nJoaquina Beach (\"Praia da Joaquina\")\nBecame internationally famous in the 1970s, when surfers from around the world discovered its waves. Joaquina Beach is accessible from the Lagoon of Conceição. Many surf cups began to emerge, and great Catarinense surfing personalities. It is one of the beaches that offers the best tourist facilities, receiving a large number of tourists from around Brazil and the world on the warm days in spring and summer. The rock complex situated to the left of the beach, the night lighting and the public showers are some of the trademarks at Joaquina. There is a big paid parking lot, toilets, tourist coach parking lot, lifeguards, police station, handicraft shop, bars, restaurant and hotels. In addition to the beach, it is possible to enjoy the most famous dunes in the South of the country as well as to sand board. The boards used in this sport can be rented on the spot.\n\nBarra da Lagoa\nBarra da Lagoa is a quaint fisherman's village but the physical characteristics of the beach make it the perfect place to learn to surf. It is a cove on the Eastern part of the island and stretches into Moçambique beach for . It is in a natural setting as there are no huge hotels on the beach and the Southern headquarters of Projeto TAMAR (Save the Turtles) is located here. Penguins swim into the canal and near the beach of Barra da Lagoa during the colder winter months of June, July and August. The canal at Barra da Lagoa connects the Lagoa da Conceição with the open sea. It is not uncommon to see fishermen during the night tossing their nets in the lagoa to catch shrimp they sell to the fresh fish restaurants in this community.\n\nIngleses Beach (\"Praia dos Ingleses\")\nEven though it is a beach preferred by tourists, Ingleses still keeps to the traditions of the Azorian colonizers. In the summer, it is one of the top beach destinations of Argentine tourists, second only to Canasveiras. In the winter, mullet fishing, religious celebrations and regional festivities are beautiful demonstrations of the local culture. The dunes separating the Ingleses Beach (English Beach) from the Santinho Beach are natural attractions not to be missed. The practice of sand board is quite common there, a sport created in Florianópolis, which consists of sliding down the dunes on a board, engaging or not in radical manoeuvres. To practice it, one must have a lot of balance and rent a board. Those looking for a different outing can go on a trek of over the dunes.\n\nArmação Beach (\"Praia da Armação\")\nThe Sant'Anna Church, built by the Armação fishing company, is part of the beach's history. It was from there that whale harpooners and crewmen confessed and attended the mass before going fishing. Next, the priest would go down to the beach to bless the boats that would sail out to sea. Today, the boats leave there for Ilha do Campeche, one of the most visited islands around Florianópolis. It is also in Armação that one finds one of the most important archaeological sites of the State of Santa Catarina. In the winter of 2010 a significant portion of the beach disappeared due to erosion. With financial aid from the Brazilian federal government, tons of large rocks were dumped on the beach to prevent houses from destruction.\n\nCampeche Beach (\"Praia do Campeche\")\nWith of white sands and a turbulent waters, Campeche is considered the Jeffreys Bay of the Santa Catarina Island for the quality of its waves. For those who are not interested in surfing, the beach offers other attractions. The paradisaical beauty of Ilha do Campeche, for instance, located across from the beach, a football game on the Saint-Exupéry aviation field, or even fishing, are some of the leisure alternatives. At night, Campeche is also an excellent attraction. The huge reflector that illuminates part of the large sand strip in front of the bars only contributes to the partying that extends far into the night. The illumination favours both those who enjoy the merrymaking as well as the fishermen, who use the time to drag their nets in from the sea.\n\nSantinho Beach (\"\") is mainly sought by tourists who look for nature, the location's paradisaical beauty and tranquility. Surfers are the main visitors and consider Santinho to be the best beach in the North of the Santa Catarina Island. It is in the left hand corner, where bathers do not venture, that surfers practice their sport, sharing the space with fishermen. away from the centre of Florianópolis, another great attraction of this beach are the primitive inscriptions made by hunters, fishermen and collectors inhabiting the Island five thousand years ago. The name Santinho comes from a human figure engraved on an isolated block of rock.\n\nOutdoor sports, including diving, hang gliding, rowing, paragliding, and mountain biking, as well as surfing, are popular on the island.\n\nThe island is connected to the Continent by three bridges. The Hercílio Luz Bridge that was built in 1926, this bridge is 11 years older than Golden Gate Bridge, but is now closed to traffic; it is a symbol of the island and often appears on postcard images. The Colombo Sales Bridge and Pedro Ivo Bridge are the ones open to traffic.\n\nSanto Amaro da Imperatriz was the first thermal water facility in Brazil. Hotels with thermal bath facilities are located in the district of Caldas da Imperatriz and in the city of Águas Mornas. The Fonte Caldas da Imperatriz city baths are an additional source of thermal waters, which can reach the temperature of , where there are immersion baths and hydromassage. It is located on the Estrada Geral Highway, km 4, Caldas da Imperatriz district.\n\nThe centre of Florianópolis, with its alleys, rows of typical houses, churches and museums, contains many examples of colonial architecture. Among these are the former government palace, nowadays the Cruz e Souza Museum (which took its name from the famous poet from Santa Catarina who formed the symbolist movement) and the Public Market built in 1898 which sells food and local handicrafts under the shade of a one-hundred-year-old fig tree. Close to the centre is the house where Victor Meirelles was born, one of the authors who devised the first mass spoken in Brazil. The building is registered by the Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage and houses the Victor Meirelles Museum.\n\nRoughly saying, the island can be divided in two sectors: in the north is the most visited side by tourists and because of that, the busiest and with the best services infrastructure. In some quarters notice a strong influence in the population architecture and customs. The most ancient livers of Florianópolis still have in the way they speak, in the craftwork activities and in the popular parties, the heritage left by immigrants from Portuguese islands from Azores. The south of the island preserved intensely Azorean customs that arrived there from the 18th century.\n\nThe Carijós Ecological Station was established by decree of 20 July 1987, covering an area of in the municipality. It preserves a significant area of mangroves on the Ilha de Santa Catarina.\nThe Pirajubaé Marine Extractive Reserve in the south bay of the Ilha de Santa Catarina protects people engaged in traditional harvesting of marine resources, mainly shellfish, from the sandbanks of the bay.\n\nFlorianópolis is served by Hercílio Luz International Airport for both domestic and international flights. It is one of the leading airports in Brazil for charter flights, especially during the summer months and from destinations such as Santiago de Chile, Buenos Aires and Córdoba, besides domestic routes. The traffic has grown significantly at the airport and therefore the city plans to upgrade and expand the airport so that 2.7 million passengers can be accommodated annually.\nThe architectural design of the expansion was chosen by a public competition held by Infraero in partnership with the Brazilian Architects Institute (IAB).\nAmong the over 150 original entries, the proposal of São Paulo architect Mário Bizelli was chosen. Normally the projects for expansion and modernization of the 66 airports administered by Infraero are done by public tender based on the needs, criteria and conditions presented by the company's engineering area.\nOn days when one of the two the local football (soccer) teams plays at home in a stadium near the airport, traffic comes to a complete standstill, often preventing vehicles from departing the airport itself. People with departing flights are well advised to check the local football schedule to ensure they arrive at the airport on time.\n\nFlorianópolis is connected to the main cities of Brazil:\n\n\nRita Maria is the city's main bus terminal, located by the Pedro Ivo Campos Bridge, on the island, serving ten thousand people daily, which can reach up to fifteen thousand during the summer season. The bus terminal connects Florianópolis to most cities, towns and villages of Santa Catarina, and to the main cities in the South, Southeast and Central-West regions of Brazil. As an international bus terminal, residents and tourists alike use Rita Maria also to reach Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile.\n\nNumerous bus terminals link the neighborhoods of Florianópolis. \n\nPedala Floripa project is a University pro bicycle program developed by CICLOBRASIL group in the State University of Santa Catarina. The project aims to provide bicycle infra-structure projects and promote bicycle use for leisure and transport in the city.\n\n\nThere are more than 40 neighborhoods in Florianópolis:\n\nThere are two professional football teams in the city. The derby between them is known as \"O Clássico da Capital\" (\"The Capital's Classic\").\n\nAvaí FC – blue and white. It is also known as O Leão da Ilha (\"The Lion of the Island\"). Its stadium is the Aderbal Ramos da Silva, popularly known as Ressacada, located in the Carianos neighborhood, in the south part of the island. Avaí is currently playing the Brazilian national second division and holds 16 State Championship titles.\n\nFigueirense FC – black and white. Its nickname is \"Figueira\" and it is also known as \"O Furacão do Estreito\". Its stadium is the Estádio Orlando Scarpelli|Orlando Scarpelli, located in the Estreito neighborhood, in the continental part of the city. Figueirense is currently playing the Brazilian national second division. The team has won Santa Catarina State Championship 18 times, the record for most titles won.\n\nFlorianópolis, is the home of Desterro Rugby Clube. Desterro has male and female rugby teams competing in the Brasil Super 10 (Men's 15s) competition and the Super 7s (women's 7s).\n\nFlorianópolis, since the beginning of the 20th century has a tradition in rowing. By the middle of that century the sport was growing in Brazil and the city had a big influence on it. But, with the decline of the sport in the country by the late 1980s, the investment slowed and by today is almost none. But is still served with three great schools, Riachuelo Remo, Martinelli Remo and Aldo Luz Remo, with all three being placed between Hercílio Luz Bridge, Colombo Salles Bridge and Pedro Ivo Campos Bridge. Since the beginning of 2008 the sport is watching a rapid growing in the number of rowers, even with people flocking from other cities to experience Floripa's rowing.\n\nFlorianópolis is the hometown of tennis player Gustavo Kuerten. There are various opportunities to practice yoga in Florianopolis with studios that host international yoga retreats and provide teacher-training courses. Sandboarding is possible in the sand dunes near Joaquina beach. Kitesurfing and Windsurfing are possible in the Lagoa da Conceição lagoon.\n\nThe island is generally considered to be blessed with the best and most consistent Surfing waves in Brazil, and in early November of each year hosts what is currently South America's only Association of Surfing Professionals World Championship Tour professional surfing competition. Brazil has played host to many an ASP tour event over the past 30 years. Former contest sites include Rio de Janeiro, Barra de Tijuca and Saquarema, but the past four years have seen the tour set up shop in Florianópolis.\n\nFalling towards the end of the tour, the past few years have seen several ASP world champions crowned in Brazil. In 2004 it was Andy Irons, and in 2005 it was Kelly Slater (who had his 2006 ASP World Title already stitched up by Brazil).\n\n\nFlorianópolis is twinned with the following cities:\n"}

The carvings on the rocks illustrates primitive men, ritual dances, men with lances in their hands, animals, bull fights, camel caravans, and picture of the sun and stars. The date of these cravings goes back to 5.000 – 20.000 years before.\n\nGobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape is situated at the south-east end of the Greater Caucasus ridge in Azerbaijan. it is located approximately 64 km away from center of Baku. The area of the site is 537 ha.\n\nThe cultural landscape covers three rocky highlands in the semi-desert territory of central Azerbaijan. There are more than 6.000 rock engravings on more than 1.000 surfaces of rocks that reflects 40.000 years of history of rock art. Jingirdag, Boyukdash, and Kichikdash mountains and Yazili hill are located in Gobustan, which are the home for the ancient rock art. Most of the rock carving can be found on the upper surface of Boyukdash and Kicikdash mountains. In 1996, by the decree of the Council of Ministers of Azerbaijan SSR, the mountains were declared as Gobustan State Historical Artistic Preserve. By the decree of the president, the mountains were declared as National Reserve in 2007. \n\nFor its quality and density of rock art engravings, Gobustan was declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.\n\nThe cultural landscape was firstly discovered by local miner in 1939-40. Later discoveries were conducted by I.

Additionally his work on narrative, best known in English through the selection \"\", has been of importance. His major work is the multi-part \"Figures\" series, of which \"Narrative Discourse\" is a section. His trilogy on textual transcendence, which has also been quite influential, is composed of \"Introduction à l'architexte\" (1979), \"\" (1982), and \"Paratexts. Thresholds of Interpretation\" (1997).\n\nHis international influence is not as great as that of some others identified with structuralism, such as Roland Barthes and Claude Lévi-Strauss; his work is more often included in selections or discussed in secondary works than studied in its own right. Terms and techniques originating in his vocabulary and systems have, however, become widespread, such as the term paratext for prefaces, introductions, illustrations or other material accompanying the text, or hypotext for the sources of the text.\n\nThis outline of Genette's narratology is derived from \"Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method\". This book forms part of his multi-volume work \"Figures I-III\". The examples used in it are mainly drawn from Proust's epic \"In Search of Lost Time\". One criticism which had been used against previous forms of narratology was that they could deal only with simple stories, such as Vladimir Propp's work in \"Morphology of the Folk Tale\". If narratology could cope with Proust, this could no longer be said.\n\nBelow are the five main concepts used by Genette in \"Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method\". They are primarily used to look at the syntax of narratives, rather than to perform an interpretation of them.\n\nSay a story is narrated as follows: the clues of a murder are discovered by a detective (event A); the circumstances of the murder are finally revealed (event B); and lastly the murderer is caught (event C).\n\nAdd corresponding numbers to the lettered events that represent their order chronologically: 1, 2, and 3.\n\nIf these events were described chronologically, they would run B1, A2, C3. \nArranged in the text, however, they run A2 (discovery), B1 (flashback), C3 (resolution).\n\nThis accounts for the 'obvious' effects the reader will recognise, such as flashback. It also deals with the structure of narratives on a more systematic basis, accounting for flash-forward, simultaneity, as well as possible, if rarely used, effects. These disarrangements on the level of order are termed 'anachrony'.\n\nThe separation between an event and its narration allows several possibilities.\n\n\nThe separation between an event and its narration means that there is discourse time and narrative time. These are the two main elements of duration.\n\n\nVoice is concerned with who narrates, and from where. This can be split four ways.\n\n\nGenette said narrative mood is dependent on the 'distance' and 'perspective' of the narrator, and like music, narrative mode has predominant patterns. It is related to voice.\n\nDistance of the narrator changes with narrated speech, transposed speech and reported speech.\n\nPerspective of the narrator is called focalization. Narratives can be non-focalized, internally focalized or externally focalized.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "220847", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=220847", "title": "Hammer and sickle", "text": "Hammer and sickle\n\nThe hammer and sickle is a symbol of proletarian solidarity that was first adopted – as : \"sickle and hammer\" – during the Russian Revolution. At the time of its creation, the hammer stood for the industrial working class and the sickle for the peasantry—combined they stood for the worker-peasant alliance for socialism. The sickle symbol resembles a sickle used to harvest grain crops and the hammer is one that would be used to make a razor sharp edge on a sickle or scythe.\n\nAfter World War I (from which Russia withdrew in the year 1917) and the Russian Civil War, the hammer and sickle became more widely used as a symbol for peaceful labor within the Soviet Union and for international proletarian unity. It was taken up by many communist movements around the world, some with local variations. Today, even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the hammer and sickle remains commonplace in Russia and other former union republics, but its display is prohibited in some other former Communist countries as well as in countries where Communism is banned by law.\nFarm and worker instruments and tools have long been used as symbols for proletarian struggle.\n\nThe combination of hammer and sickle symbolised the combination of farmers and construction workers. One example of use prior to its political instrumentalisation by the Soviet Union is found in Chilean currency circulating since 1895.\n\nAn alternative example is the combination of a hammer and a plough, with the same meaning (unity of peasants and workers). In Ireland, the symbol of the plough remains in use. The Starry Plough banner was originally used by the Irish Citizen Army, a socialist republican workers' militia. James Connolly, co-founder of the Irish Citizen Army with Jack White, said the significance of the banner was that a free Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars. A sword is forged into the plough to symbolise the end of war with the establishment of a Socialist International. This was unveiled in 1914 and flown by the Irish Citizen Army during the 1916 Easter Rising.\n\nIn 1917, Vladimir Lenin and Anatoly Lunacharsky held a competition to create a Soviet emblem. The winning design was a hammer and sickle on top of a globe in rays of the sun, surrounded by a wreath of grain and under a five-pointed star, with the inscription \"proletariats of the world, unite!\" in six languages (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Georgian, Armenian and Azerbaijani). It originally featured a sword, but Lenin strongly objected, disliking the violent connotations. The winning designer was Yevgeny Ivanovich Kamzolkin (1885–1957).\n\nOn 6 July 1923, the 2nd session of the Central Executive Committee (CIK) adopted this emblem.\n\n\nAt the time of creation, the hammer and sickle stood for worker-peasant alliance, with the hammer a traditional symbol of the industrial proletariat (who dominated the proletariat of Russia) and the sickle a traditional symbol for the peasantry, but the meaning has since broadened to a globally recognizable symbol for Marxism, Marxist parties, or socialist states.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, the hammer and sickle came to take on a gendered meaning, with the sickle coming to be associated with women and the hammer men.\n\nTwo federal subjects of the post-Soviet Russian Federation use the hammer and sickle in their symbols: the Vladimir Oblast has them on its flag and the Bryansk Oblast has them on its flag and coat of arms, which is also the central element of its flag. In addition, the Russian city of Oryol also uses the hammer and sickle on its flag.\n\nThe former Soviet (now Russian) national airline, Aeroflot, continues to use the hammer and sickle in its symbol.\n\nThe hammer and sickle can be found as a logo on most ushanka hats, usually the Soviet-styled ones\n\nThe \"de facto\" government of Transnistria uses (with minor modifications) the flag and the emblem of the former Moldavian SSR, which includes the hammer and sickle. The flag can also appear without the hammer and sickle in some circumstances, for example on Transnistrian-issued license plates.\n\nThree out of the five currently ruling Communist parties use a hammer and sickle as the party symbol: the Communist Party of China, the Communist Party of Vietnam and the Lao People's Revolutionary Party. All of these use the yellow-on-red colour scheme. In Laos and Vietnam, the hammer and sickle party flags can often be seen flying side-by-side with their respective national flags.\n\nMany communist parties around the world also use it, including the Communist Party of Greece Communist Party of Chile, the Communist Party of Brazil, the Egyptian Communist Party, the Communist Party of Pakistan, the Communist Party of Spain, the Communist Party of Denmark, the Communist Party of Norway, the Romanian Communist Party, the Lebanese Communist Party, the Communist Party of the Philippines and the Shining Path. The Communist Party of Sweden, the Portuguese Communist Party and the Mexican Communist Party use the hammer and sickle imposed on the red star. The hammer and sickle accompanied by the yellow star is used by the Communist Refoundation Party, the main communist party in Italy.\n\nMany symbols having similar structures and messages to the original have been designed. For example, the Angolan flag shows a segment of a cog, crossed by a machete and crowned with a socialist star while the flag of Mozambique features an AK-47 crossed by a hoe. In the logo of the Communist Party USA, a circle is formed by a half cog and a semicircular sickle-blade. A hammer is laid directly over the sickle's handle with the hammer's head at the logo's center. The logo of the Communist Party of Turkey consists of half a cog wheel crossed by a hammer, with a star on the top.\n\nTools represented in other designs include: the brush, sickle and hammer of the Workers' Party of Korea; the spade, flaming torch and quill used prior to 1984 by the British Labour Party (which was a socialist and not a communist party); the pickaxe and rifle used in communist Albania; and the hammer and compasses of the East German emblem and flag. The Far Eastern Republic of Russia used an anchor crossed over a spade or pickaxe, symbolising the union of the fishermen and miners. The Fourth International, founded by Leon Trotsky, uses a hammer and sickle symbol on which the number 4 is superimposed. The hammer and sickle in the Fourth International symbol are the opposite of other hammer and sickle symbols in that the head of the hammer is on the right side and the sickle end tip on the left. The Trotskyist League for the Fifth International merges a hammer with the number 5, using the number's lower arch to form the sickle.\n\nThe Communist Party of Britain (CGB) uses the hammer and dove symbol. Designed in 1988 by Michal Boncza, it is intended to highlight the party's connection to the peace movement. It is usually used in conjunction with the hammer and sickle and it appears on all of the CPB's publications. Some members of the CPB prefer one symbol over the other, although the party's 1994 congress reaffirmed the hammer and dove's position as the official emblem of the party. Similarly, the Communist Party of Israel uses a dove over the hammer and sickle as its symbol. The flag of the Guadeloupe Communist Party uses a sickle, turned to look like a majuscule G, to represent Guadeloupe.\n\nThe flag of the Black Front, a Strasserist group founded by early Nazi Party members and expelled around the time of the Night of the Long Knives purge, along with his supporters and the Sturmabteilung and originator of the ideology and the Black Front himself Otto Strasser, featured a crossed hammer and sword, symbolizing the unity of the workers and military.\n\nThe flag of Burma (from 1974–2010) featured a bushel of rice superimposed on a cogwheel.\n\nThe flag of Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM, Party of the Revolution in Swahili), currently the ruling political party of Tanzania, has a slightly different symbol with a hammer and a hoe (\"jembe\") instead of a sickle to represent the most common farm tool in Africa.\n\nThe National Bolshevik Party used the hammer and sickle in their flag, but colored black instead of gold and in a design similar to the Nazi flag, a brighter red flag than the USSR, with a black hammer and sickle on a white disk in the center.\n\nThe hammer and sickle has long been a common theme in socialist realism, but it has also seen some depiction in non-Marxist popular culture. Andy Warhol who created many drawings and photographs of the hammer and sickle is the most famous example of this.\n\nIn several countries in the former Eastern Bloc, there are laws that define the hammer and sickle as the symbol of a \"totalitarian and criminal ideology\" and the public display of the hammer and sickle and other Communist symbols such as the red star is considered a criminal offence. Georgia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova (1 October 2012 – 4 June 2013) and Ukraine have banned communist symbols including this one. A similar law was considered in Estonia, but it eventually failed in a parliamentary committee.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and the Czech Republic called for a European Union-wide ban on communist symbols in 2010, urging the European Union \"to criminalize the approval, denial or belittling of communist crimes\" and stating that \"the denial of such crimes should be treated the same way as the denial of the Holocaust and must be banned by law\".\n\nIn February 2013, the Constitutional Court of Hungary annulled the ban on the use of symbols of fascist and communist dictatorships, including the hammer and sickle, the red star and the swastika, saying the ban was too broad and imprecise. The court also pointed to a judgement of the European Court of Human Rights in which Hungary was found guilty of violation of article 10, the right to freedom of expression. In June 2013, the Constitutional Court of Moldova ruled that the Moldovan Communist Party’s symbols—the hammer and sickle—are legal and can be used.\n\nIn Indonesia, the public display of communist symbols like the hammer and sickle is banned by decree following the 1965–1966 killings of communists. In addition to being banned, the symbols are also highly stigmatized, similar to Nazi symbolism in the West.\n\nIn Poland, dissemination of items which are \"mediums of fascist, communist or other totalitarian symbolism\" was criminalized in 1997. However, the Constitutional Tribunal found this sanction to be unconstitutional in 2011. In contrast to this treatment of the symbolism, promotion of fascist, communist and other ideology deemed totalitarian remains illegal.\n\nA ban on the Hammer and sickle and other Communist symbols is currently also being considered in Brazil, the bill was introduced in 2016 but it has yet to be voted in Congress.\n\nIn Unicode, the \"hammer and sickle\" symbol is U+262D (☭). It is part of the Miscellaneous Symbols (2600–26FF) code block. On systems where Compose key is available, it could be written as codice_1.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "223149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=223149", "title": "Isfahan", "text": "Isfahan\n\nIsfahan (historically also rendered in English as Ispahan, Sepahan, Esfahan or Hispahan) ( ) is a city in Iran. It is located south of Tehran, and is the capital of Isfahan Province.\n\nIsfahan has a population of approximately 1.6 million, making it the third largest city in Iran after Tehran and Mashhad. \n\nIsfahan is an important city as it is located at the intersection of the two principal north–south and east–west routes that traverse Iran. It was once one of the largest cities in the world. It flourished from 1050 to 1722, particularly in the 16th and 17th centuries under the Safavid dynasty when it became the capital of Persia for the second time in its history. Even today the city retains much of its past glory. It is famous for its Persian–Islamic architecture, having many beautiful boulevards, covered bridges, palaces, mosques, and minarets, and the city also has many historical buildings, monuments, paintings and artefacts. The fame of Isfahan led to the Persian pun and proverb \"Esfahān nesf-e- jahān ast\": Isfahan is half (of) the world.\n\nThe Naghsh-e Jahan Square in Isfahan is one of the largest city squares in the world. UNESCO has designated it a World Heritage Site.\n\n\"Isfahan\" is derived from Middle Persian \"Spahān\". \"Spahān\" is attested in various Middle Persian seals and inscriptions, including that of Zoroastrian Magi Kartir, and is also the Armenian name of the city (Սպահան). The present-day name is the Arabicized form of \"Ispahan\" (unlike Middle Persian, and similar to Spanish, New Persian does not allow initial consonant clusters such as \"sp\"). The region appears with the abbreviation \"GD\" (Southern Media) on Sasanian numismatics. In Ptolemy's Geographia it appears as \"Aspadana\", translating to \"place of gathering for the army\". It is believed that \"Spahān\" derives from \"spādānām\" \"the armies\", Old Persian plural of \"spāda\" (from which derives \"spāh\" 'army' and spahi (soldier – lit. \"of the army\") in Middle Persian).\n\nHuman habitation of the Isfahan region can be traced back to the Palaeolithic period. Recent discoveries archaeologists have found artifacts dating back to the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze and Iron ages.\n\nWhat was to become the city of Isfahan in later historical periods probably emerged as a locality and settlement that gradually developed over the course of the Elamite civilisation (2700–1600 BCE).\n\nUnder Median rule, this commercial entrepôt began to show signs of a more sedentary urbanism, steadily growing into a noteworthy regional centre that benefited from the exceptionally fertile soil on the banks of the Zayandehrud River in a region called Aspandana or Ispandana.\n\nOnce Cyrus the Great (reg. 559–529 BCE) had unified Persian and Median lands into the Achaemenid Empire (648–330 BCE), the religiously and ethnically diverse city of Isfahan became an early example of the king's fabled religious tolerance. It was Cyrus who, having just taken Babylon, made an edict in 538 BCE, declaring that the Jews in Babylon could return to Jerusalem (see Ezra ch. 1). Now it seems that some of these freed Jews settled in Isfahan instead of returning to their homeland. The 10th-century Persian historian Ibn al-Faqih wrote:\n\nThe Parthians in the period 250–226 BCE continued the tradition of tolerance after the fall of the Achaemenids, fostering the Hellenistic dimension within Iranian culture and the political organisation introduced by Alexander the Great's invading armies. Under the Parthians, Arsacid governors administered the provinces of the nation from Isfahan, and the city's urban development accelerated to accommodate the needs of a capital city.\nThe next empire to rule Persia, the Sassanids (226–652 CE), presided over massive changes in their realm, instituting sweeping agricultural reform and reviving Iranian culture and the Zoroastrian religion. Both the city and region were then called by the name Aspahan or Spahan. The city was governed by a group called the Espoohrans, who came from seven noble and important Iranian royal families. Extant foundations of some Sassanid-era bridges in Isfahan suggest that the Sasanian kings were fond of ambitious urban planning projects. While Isfahan's political importance declined during the period, many Sassanid princes would study statecraft in the city, and its military role developed rapidly. Its strategic location at the intersection of the ancient roads to Susa and Persepolis made it an ideal candidate to house a standing army, ready to march against Constantinople at any moment. The words 'Aspahan' and 'Spahan' are derived from the Pahlavi or Middle Persian meaning 'the place of the army'. Although many theories have been mentioned about the origin of Isfahan, in fact little is known of it before the rule of the Sasanian dynasty (c. 224 – c. 651 CE). The historical facts suggest that in the late 4th and early 5th centuries, Queen Shushandukht, the Jewish consort of Yazdegerd I (reigned 399–420) settled a colony of Jews in Yahudiyyeh (also spelled Yahudiya), a settlement 3 km northwest of the Zoroastrian city of Gabae (its Achaemid and Parthian name; Gabai was its Sasanic name, which was shortened to Gay (Arabic 'Jay') that was located on the northern bank of the Zayanderud River. The gradual population decrease of Gay (Jay) and the simultaneous population increase of Yahudiyyeh and its suburbs after the Islamic conquest of Iran resulted in the formation of the nucleus of what was to become the city of Isfahan. The words \"Aspadana\", \"Ispadana\", \"Spahan\" and \"Sepahan\", all from which the word Isfahan is derived, referred to the region in which the city was located.\n\nIsfahan and Gay were both circular in design, a characteristic of Parthian and Sasanian cities.\n\nWhen the Arabs captured Isfahan in 642, they made it the capital of al-Jibal (\"the Mountains\") province, an area that covered much of ancient Media. Isfahan grew prosperous under the Persian Buyid (Buwayhid) dynasty, which rose to power and ruled much of Iran when the temporal authority of the Abbasid caliphs waned in the 10th century. The Turkish conqueror and founder of the Seljuq dynasty, Toghril Beg, made Isfahan the capital of his domains in the mid-11th century; but it was under his grandson Malik-Shah I (r. 1073–92) that the city grew in size and splendour. \nAfter the fall of the Seljuqs (c. 1200), Isfahan temporarily declined and was eclipsed by other Iranian cities such as Tabriz and Qazvin.\n\nDuring his visit in 1327, Ibn Battuta noted that \"The city of Isfahan is one of the largest and fairest of cities, but it is now in ruins for the greater part.\" It regained its importance during the Safavid period (1501–1736). The city's golden age began in 1598 when the Safavid ruler Shah Abbas I (reigned 1588–1629) made it his capital and rebuilt it into one of the largest and most beautiful cities in the 17th century world. In 1598 Shah Abbas the Great moved his capital from Qazvin to the more central Isfahan; he name it \"Ispahān\" (New Persian) so that it wouldn't be threatened by the Ottomans. This new status ushered in a golden age for the , with architecture and Persian culture flourishing. In the 16th and 17th centuries, thousands of deportees and migrants from the Caucasus, that Abbas and other Safavid rulers had permitted to emigrate en masse, settled in the city. So now the city had enclaves of Georgian, Circassian, and Daghistani descent. Engelbert Kaempfer, who dwelt in Safavid Persia in 1684–85, estimated their number at 20,000. During the Safavid era, the city contained a very large Armenian community as well. As part of Abbas's forced resettlement of peoples from within his empire, he resettled as many as 300,000 Armenians) from near the unstable Safavid-Ottoman border, primarily from the very wealthy Armenian town of Jugha (also known as Old Julfa) in mainland Iran. In Isfahan, he ordered the foundation of a new quarter for these resettled Armenians from Old Julfa, and thus the Armenian Quarter of Isfahan was named New Julfa. Today, the New Jolfa district of Isfahan remains a heavily Armenian-populated district, with Armenian churches and shops, the Vank Cathedral being especially notable for its combination of Armenian Christian and Iranian Islamic elements. It is still one of the oldest and largest Armenian quarters in the world. Following an agreement between Shah Abbas I and his Georgian subject Teimuraz I of Kakheti (\"Tahmuras Khan\"), whereby the latter submitted to Safavid rule in exchange for being allowed to rule as the region’s wāli (governor) and for having his son serve as dāruḡa (\"prefect\") of Isfahan in perpetuity, the Georgian prince converted to Islam and served as governor. He was accompanied by a troop of soldiers, some of whom were Georgian Orthodox Christians. The royal court in Isfahan had a great number of Georgian ḡolāms (military slaves), as well as Georgian women. Although they spoke both Persian and Turkic, their mother tongue was Georgian. During Abbas's reign, Isfahan became very famous in Europe, and many European travellers made an account of their visit to the city, such as Jean Chardin. This prosperity lasted until it was sacked by Afghan invaders in 1722 during a marked decline in Safavid influence.\n\nThereafter, Isfahan experienced a decline in importance, culminating in a move of the capital to Mashhad and Shiraz during the Afsharid and Zand periods respectively, until it was finally moved to Tehran in 1775 by Agha Mohammad Khan, the founder of the Qajar dynasty. (See https://www.britannica.com/place/Tehran)\n\nIn the early years of the 19th century, efforts were made to preserve some of Ifsahan's archeologically important buildings. The work was started by Mohammad Hossein Khan during the reign of Fath Ali Shah.\n\nIn the 20th century, Isfahan was resettled by a very large number of people from southern Iran, firstly during the population migrations at the start of the century, and again in the 1980s following the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nToday, Isfahan produces fine carpets, textiles, steel, handicrafts, and traditional foods including sweets. There are nuclear experimental reactors as well as facilities for producing nuclear fuel (UCF) within the environs of the city. Isfahan has one of the largest steel-producing facilities in the region, as well as facilities for producing special alloys. Mobarakeh Steel Company is the biggest steel producer in the whole of the Middle East and Northern Africa, and it is the biggest DRI producer in the world. The Isfahan Steel Company was the first manufacturer of constructional steel products in Iran, and it remains the largest such company today.\n\nThe city has an international airport and a metro line.\n\nThere are a major oil refinery and a large airforce base outside the city. HESA, Iran's most advanced aircraft manufacturing plant, is located just outside the city. Isfahan is also attracting international investment, especially in the Isfahan City Center which is the largest shopping mall in Iran and the fifth largest in the world.\n\nIsfahan hosted the International Physics Olympiad in 2007.\n\nThe city is located in the lush plain of the Zayanderud River at the foothills of the Zagros mountain range. The nearest mountain is Mount Soffeh (Kuh-e Soffeh), just south of the city. No geological obstacles exist within north of Isfahan, allowing cool winds to blow from this direction. Situated at above sea level on the eastern side of the Zagros Mountains, Isfahan has an arid climate (Köppen \"BWk\"). Despite its altitude, Isfahan remains hot during the summer, with maxima typically around 35 °C (95 °F). However, with low humidity and moderate temperatures at night, the climate is quite pleasant. During the winter, days are mild while nights can be very cold. Snow has occurred at least once every winter except 1986/1987 and 1989/1990. The Zayande River starts in the Zagros Mountains, flowing from the west through the heart of the city, then dissipates in the wetland.\n\nAir pollution is one of the major environmental issues in Isfahan. Due to an increase in the number of cars in the city, thermal power plants, petrochemical complexes and the oil refinery in the west of the city, air pollution levels have increased markedly in the second half of the 20th century. With the introduction of national environment levels for heavy industry, industrial pollution has been reduced in recent years. However, the air quality in the city is far below world norms. Indeed, Isfahan has the highest air pollution index of all the major cities in Iran. This is thought to be partly due to its climate and geography.\n\nMain places\n\nThe city centre consists of an older section revolving around the Jameh Mosque, and the Safavid expansion around Naqsh-e Jahan Square, with nearby places of worship, palaces, and bazaars.\n\n\nThe bridges on the Zayanderud river comprise some of the finest architecture in Isfahan.

The animal was described as a very small bear with wooly light brown fur. The few lava bears that were killed or captured were a little larger than a badger. It was once thought to be a separate species. However, scientists who examined the specimens determined that the animals were stunted due to the harsh environment in which they lived. Today, it is acknowledged that lava bears never existed as a unique species.\n\nWhen lava bears were first encountered in the early 20th century it was speculated that they might be a unique species, possibly a dwarf grizzly. The diminutive bears resembled black bears in many ways, but were much smaller with wooly fur that was light brown in color, similar to grizzly bears. Specimens taken by hunters were a little larger than a badger. They were approximately to long and between and high. The bears weighed between and . Gray hair on their muzzles along with well-worn claws and teeth indicated that some of the specimens were adult bears.\n\nOne of the first lava bear specimens taken in the wild was mounted and sent to United States Bureau of Biological Survey in Washington, District of Columbia. Eventually, scientist determined that lava bears were American black bears (\"Ursus americanus\"), stunted by malnutrition caused by the austere environment where the animals lived and foraged.\n\nFrom 1917 through the early 1930s, a number of people reported seeing small bears in the lava beds and surrounding high desert county of northern Lake County, Oregon. The bears were initially called \"sand lappers\", but eventually became known as lava bears. The first documented encounter was in 1917, when a sheepherder name O. T. McKendree killed a small bear near Fossil Lake. Originally, McKendree thought it was a black bear cub, but upon further inspection he found the animal was a very small adult bear. He had the animal mounted by a taxidermist. The mounted lava bear was exhibited in The Dalles and later in Lakeview. A photograph of the mounted bear was published in \"Oregon Sportsman\" magazine in October 1917. Eventually, the mounted specimen was sent to Washington, D. C., where it was examined by Clinton Hart Merriam of the Bureau of Biological Survey. Merriam, an expert on North American bears, determined that the specimen was an unusually small American black bear.\n\nPublicity generated by the \"Oregon Sportsman\" photograph and various newspaper articles about the miniature bear made it a fascinating creature. In 1920, Irvin S. Cobb, a well-known writer for \"The Saturday Evening Post\", organized a hunting trip to Oregon with the stated purpose of finding a lava bear. While Cobb did not locate a lava bear during his hunt, he left Oregon believing they existed. He thought the little bears were a dwarf grizzly or a species of sun bear, unique to North America. After he left Oregon, several of the local trappers who accompanied Cobb began to actively search for lava bears. In addition, the story Cobb wrote about his hunting trip for \"The Saturday Evening Post\" increased interest in the animal across the county.\n\nIn 1923, Alfred Andrews, a trapper for the United States Forest Service, reported killing a lava bear near Fort Rock. He sent the specimen to the Oregon biological survey office for examination. A year later, Andrews captured a live lava bear. The animal looked like a small grizzly bear, but weighed only . It was a male, long and high. The Smithsonian offered Andrews $2,000 for the live lava bear, but he decided not to sell the animal. Instead, he announced plans to tour the country with the bear. He displayed the bear in Portland, where 8,000 people paid to see the animal. It was also exhibited in Bend and Klamath Falls before being taken to Los Angeles, California. Eventually, Andrews' partner Harry Thrall stole or sold the bear and the animal disappeared.\n\nIn the fall of 1924, a second lava bear was captured alive near Summer Lake. That bear weighed only . Another lava bear was trapped by L. E. Oster in the lava beds northeast of Fort Rock in 1933. A fourth lava bear was taken alive the following year by Walter Gore and Roy Yeager in an area east of Crescent Lake. It weighed and resembled a miniature grizzly. The last animal identified as a lava bear was captured in 1934 by a forest road crew near Scar Mountain in the Willamette National Forest. It was long and weighed . It was exhibited for a time in McKenzie Bridge, Oregon before the animal was sold to a man named Alfred Bayne. As late as 1981, scientist were being asked to identify small bear tracks in the Fort Rock area to determine if they were made by lava bears.\n\nToday, it is accepted that lava bears are actually common American black bears. It is also generally acknowledged that all of the animals that were killed or captured between 1917 and 1934 were either black bear cubs or small adults stunted from malnutrition.\n\nIn 1924, Bend Senior High School selected the lava bear as the school’s sports mascot. The mascot was chosen shortly after a living bear was exhibited in Bend. At the time, it was thought that lava bears might be a species unique to Central Oregon. In 2013, \"The Oregonian\" newspaper conducted a statewide survey, asking Oregon sports fans to identify their favorite high school team mascots. Fans from across the state of Oregon, selected Bend’s \"Lava Bear\" as their top pick for large school mascot.\n\n"}

The route extended from the hillside village of Colonnata to the port of Marina di Carrara.\n\nThe railway, projected in 1866, was inaugurated in 1876 and was connected to the pre-existent Avenza-Carrara railway (1866), linking the main station of Carrara Avenza to Carrara San Martino, in city centre. A subsequent expansion to the quarries below the Apuan Alps (Gioia, Ravaccione-Polvaccio and Colonnata) was proposed in 1885. Work began in 1887 and the new branch was inaugurated on 15 May 1890. The line was owned by the SFMPC (Società Ferrovia Marmifera Privata di Carrara) and operated by the SFAI (Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia).\n\nEven if its bridges were damaged by bombings and sabotages during the Second World War, the line was practically in continuous operation from 1876 to 1964, when it was closed due to competition from road traffic.

Subsequently the railway runs through the city of Carrara and, from San Martino to Avenza station follows a path almost parallel to that of the passenger line. From Avenza FS station to the port, in Marina di Carrara, the line follows a straight parallel to that of the former tramway, with a small branch to the station of Covetta.

{"id": "163408", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163408", "title": "Mestizo", "text": "Mestizo\n\nMestizo (; ) is a term traditionally used in Spain, Latin America and the Philippines that originally referred to a person of combined European and Native American descent, regardless of where the person was born. The term was used as an ethnic/racial category in the \"casta\" system that was in use during the Spanish Empire's control of its American and Asian colonies. Nowadays though, particularly in Latin America, \"mestizo\" has become more of a cultural term, with culturally mainstream Latin Americans regarded or termed as mestizos regardless of their actual ancestry and with the term Indian being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate indigenous ethnic identity, language, tribal affiliation, etc. Consequently, today, the vast majority of Spanish-speaking Latin Americans are regarded as Mestizos.\n\nThe term mestizaje – taking as its root \"mestizo\" or mixed – is the Spanish word for miscegenation, the general process of mixing ancestries.\n\nTo avoid confusion with the original usage of the term , mixed people started to be referred to collectively as . In some Latin American countries, such as Mexico, the concept of the mestizo became central to the formation of a new independent identity that was neither wholly Spanish nor wholly indigenous and the word mestizo acquired its current meaning, with it being used by the government to refer to all Mexicans who do not speak indigenous languages, including people of complete European or indigenous descent as well as Asians and Africans.\n\nIn colonial Venezuela, was more commonly used instead of . means being mixed without specifying which mixture; it was used to describe anyone born in the Americas whose ancestry was a mixture of European, Amerindian and black African.\n\nIn the Spanish system of racial hierarchy, the \"sistema de castas\", mestizos/, who formed the majority, had fewer rights than the minority elite European-born persons called , and the minority white colonial-born whites , but more rights than the now-minority , , and populations.\n\nThe Portuguese cognate, \"mestiço\", historically referred to any mixture of Portuguese and local populations in the Portuguese colonies. In colonial Brazil most of the non-slave population was initially \"mestiço de indio\", i.e. mixed white and native Brazilian. There was no descent-based casta system, and children of upper class white landlord males and female slaves would enjoy privileges higher than the ones given to the lower classes, such as formal education, though such cases were not so common and they tended to not inherit property, generally given to the children of free women, who tended to be legitimate offspring in cases of concubinage (also a common practice, inherited from Amerindian and African customs). In Portuguese India also, the mixed population was known as \"mestiços\" and the local Indian Christians as \"indiacatos\".\n\nIn the Philippines, which was a colony of Spain, the term \"mestizo\" came to refer to a Filipino with any foreign ancestry, especially white, and usually shortened as \"Tisoy\".\n\nIn Canada, the Métis people is a distinct community composed of the descendants of Europeans (usually French, sometimes Scottish or English) involved in the fur trade and North American Indigenous peoples of what is now Western Canada.\n\nIn Saint Barthélemy, the term mestizo refers to people of mixed European (usually French) and East Asian ancestry.\n\nThe Spanish word is from Latin \"mixticius\", meaning mixed. Its usage has been documented as early as 1275, to refer to the offspring of an Egyptian and a Semite. This term was first documented in English in 1582.\n\nIn the United States, Canada and other English-speaking countries and cultures, mestizo, as a loanword from Spanish, is used to mean a non-white of mixed European and American Indian descent exclusively, generally with connection to a Latin American culture or of Latin American descent, a concept much stricter than that found in Romance languages (especially Portuguese, possessing terms that are not cognate with mestizo for such admixture, and thus the concept of is not seen as particularly connected with Amerindian ancestry at all). It is related to the particular racial identity of historical non-white Amerindian-descended Hispanic and Latino American communities in an American context.\n\nIn English-speaking Canada, Canadian Métis (with upper-case), as a loanword from French, refers to persons of mixed French and Indigenous ancestry. French-speaking Canadians, when using the word métis, are referring to Canadian Métis ethnicity, and all persons of mixed Amerindian and European ancestry, rather than the broader concept of mixed-race people in general ( with lowercase), present in all other French-speaking countries, as would speakers of Spanish; the usual term to refer to mixed-raced people in general is thus \"mulâtre\", which is considered elsewhere pejorative. In the United States, Métis Americans and Mestizo Americans are two distinct racial and ethno-racial identities, as reflected in the use of French and Spanish loanwords, respectively.\n\nIn the Philippines, the word \"mestizo\" usually refers to a Filipino with combined Indigenous and European ancestry, but occasionally it will be used for a Filipino with apparent Chinese ancestry, who will also be referred to as 'chinito'. The latter was officially listed as a \"mestizo de sangley\" in birth records of the 19th century, with 'sangley' as a reference to the Hokkienese word for business, 'seng-li'.\n\nIn the Portuguese-speaking world, the contemporary sense has been the closest to the historical usage from the Middle Ages, because of important linguistic differences, so that (mixed-race, mixed-ethnicity, miscegenated, etc.) is separated altogether from (any kind of brown people) and (brown people originally of European–Amerindian admixture or assimilated Amerindians), in which can be also fully white, black or East Asian in their full definition (thus not brown) and one does not need to be a to be a part of the latter two categories.\n\nIn Brazil specifically, at least in modern times all non-Indigenous people are part of a single ethnicity (; lines between ethnic groups are historically fluid), the (, ) group is by far the largest among the free people since the earliest decades of the colony. As explained above, the concept of should not in any way be confused with the mestizo as used in either the Spanish-speaking world or the English-speaking one, as it relates no special relation to being of Amerindian extraction, and also should not be confused with , literally \"brown people\" (there are among all major groups of the country, Indigenous, Asian, white, and black, and they are likely the majority in the three latter ones).\n\n ( ), (, ), (), (), (), (), (), \"mestee\" (), and mixed (English) are all cognates of the Latin word \"mixticius\".\n\nIn the Spanish colonial period, the Spanish developed an extremely vast complex system of racial hierarchy, which was used for social control and which also determined a person's standing in society.\n\nThere were three main categories of race during the initial period of colonization of the Americas by the Spanish: White Spaniard (\"español\"), Amerindian (\"indio\"), and Black African (\"negro\"). During the Spanish colonial era, a myriad of terms (such , , and ) were created to differentiate these racial mixtures, called collectively \"castas\". By the end of the colonial period in 1821, over one hundred sub-categories of possible variations of mixture existed, but official church and civil records were maintained with few categories. Church baptismal and marriage registers and civil records (censuses, arrest records) used the terms \"español\", \"castizo\", \"mestizo\", \"mulato\", and \"indio\".\n\nThroughout the territories of Spanish Empire in the Americas, systems of racial hierarchy, the \"sistema de castas\" or the \"sociedad de castas\" developed where society was divided based on race, wealth, and where one was born. The main divisions were as follows:\n\nPersons of mixed race were collectively referred to as \"castas\".\nIn theory, and as depicted in eighteenth-century Mexican casta paintings, \"español\" status could also be attained by people of mixed origin who consistently had intermarried with Europeans. Such cases might include the offspring of a \"castizo\" (3/4 Spanish and 1/4 Indian) parent and one Peninsular or criollo parent.\n\nA person's legal racial classification in colonial Spanish America was closely tied to social status, wealth, culture and language use. Wealthy people paid to change or obscure their actual ancestry. Many indigenous people left their traditional villages and sought to be counted as mestizos to avoid tribute payments to the Spanish. Many indigenous people, and sometimes those with partial African descent, were classified as mestizo if they spoke Spanish and lived as mestizos.\n\nIn the early colonial period, the offspring of españoles and Indias were raised either in the Hispanic world, if the father recognized the child, even though illegitimate; or the child was raised in the indigenous world of the mother if he did not. As early as 1533, Charles V mandated the high court (Audiencia) to take the children of Spanish men and indigenous women from their mothers and educate them in the Spanish sphere. As this mixed group born out of wedlock increased in numbers, generally living in their mother's indigenous communities, but increasingly not accepted there either, and being designated mestizos with the assumption that they were illegitimate.\n\nWhen the Mexican republic was established in 1824, legal racial categories ceased to exist. The production of casta paintings in New Spain ceased at the same juncture, after almost a century as a genre.\n\nBecause the term had taken on a myriad of meanings, the designation \"mestizo\" was removed from census counts in Mexico and is no longer in use.\n\nThe large majority of Mexicans can be classified as \"Mestizos\", meaning in modern Mexican usage that they identify fully neither with any indigenous culture nor with a particular non-Indigenous heritage, but rather identify as having cultural traits incorporating both indigenous and European elements. In Mexico, Mestizo has become a blanket term which not only refers to mixed Mexicans but includes all Mexican citizens who do not speak indigenous languages even Asian Mexicans and Afro-Mexicans.\nBy the deliberate efforts of post-revolutionary governments the \"Mestizo identity\" was constructed as the base of the modern Mexican national identity, through a process of cultural synthesis referred to as (). Mexican politicians and reformers such as José Vasconcelos and Manuel Gamio were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje (the process of race homogenization).\n\nCultural policies in early post-revolutionary Mexico were paternalistic towards the indigenous people, with efforts designed to \"help\" indigenous peoples achieve the same level of progress as the Mestizo society, eventually assimilating indigenous peoples completely to mainstream Mexican culture, working toward the goal of eventually solving the \"Indian problem\" by transforming indigenous communities into Mestizo communities.\nSometimes, particularly outside of Mexico, the word \"mestizo\" is used with the meaning of Mexican persons with mixed Indigenous and European blood. This usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where a person of pure indigenous genetic heritage would be considered mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language, and a person with none or very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage. In the Yucatán peninsula the word mestizo has a different meaning to the one used in the rest of Mexico, being used to refer to the Maya-speaking populations living in traditional communities, because during the caste war of the late 19th century those Maya who did not join the rebellion were classified as mestizos. In Chiapas, the term \"Ladino\" is used instead of mestizo.\n\nDue to the extensiveness of the modern definition of Mestizo, various publications offer different estimations of this group, some try to use a biological, racial perspective and calculate the Mestizo population in contemporary Mexico as being around a half and two thirds of the population, while others use the culture-based definition, and estimate the percentage of Mestizos as high as 90% of the Mexican population, several others mix-up both due lack of knowledge in regards to the modern definition and assert that mixed race Mexicans are as much as 93% of Mexico’s population.\nParadoxically to its wide definition, the word Mestizo has long been dropped of popular Mexican vocabulary, with the word even having pejorative connotations, which further complicates attempts to quantify Mestizos via self-identification.\n\nWhile for most of its history the concept of Mestizo and Mestizaje has been lauded by Mexico’s intellectual circles, in recent times the concept has been target of criticism, with its detractors claiming that it delegitimizes racist practices in Mexico under the idea of “(Racism) Not existing here (Mexico), as everybody is Mestizo” the Mestizo ideology thus, has cemented a terrain of resistance in regards to social, politic and academic mobility around the theme of race in Mexico. In general, the authors conclude that Mexico introducing a real racial classification and accepting itself as a multicultural country opposed to a monolithic Mestizo country would bring benefits to the Mexican society as a whole.\n\nA 2012 study published by the Journal of Human Genetics found that the Y-chromosome (paternal) ancestry of the average Mexican Mestizo was predominately European (64.9%), followed by Native American (30.8%), and African (4.2%). The European ancestry was more prevalent in the north and west (66.7–95%) and Native American ancestry increased in the centre and south-east (37–50%), the African ancestry was low and relatively homogeneous (0–8.8%). The states that participated in this study were Aguascalientes, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Veracruz and Yucatán.\n\nA study of 104 Mestizos from Sonora, Yucatán, Guerrero, Zacatecas, Veracruz, and Guanajuato by Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine, reported that Mestizo Mexicans are 58.96% European, 31.05% Native American, and 10.03% African. Sonora shows the highest European contribution (70.63%) and Guerrero the lowest (51.98%) which also has the highest Native American contribution (37.17%). African contribution ranges from 2.8% in Sonora to 11.13% in Veracruz. 80% of the Mexican population was classed as mestizo (defined as \"being racially mixed in some degree\").\n\nIn May 2009, the same institution (Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine) issued a report on a genomic study of 300 Mestizos from those same states. The study found that the Mestizo population of these Mexican states were on average 55% of indigenous ancestry followed by 41.8% of European, 1.8% of African, and 1.2% of East Asian ancestry.\n\nThe study also noted that whereas Mestizo individuals from the southern state of Guerrero showed on average 66% of indigenous ancestry, those from the northern state of Sonora displayed about 61.6% European ancestry. The study found that there was an increase in indigenous ancestry as one traveled towards to the Southern states in Mexico, while the indigenous ancestry declined as one traveled to the Northern states in the country, such as Sonora.\n\nThe Ladino people are a mix of mestizo or hispanicized peoples in Latin America, principally in Central America. The demonym \"Ladino\" is a Spanish word that derives from \"Latino\". \"Ladino\" is an exonym invented of the colonial era to refer to those Spanish-speakers who were not colonial elites of Peninsulares, Criollos, or indigenous peoples.\n\n most Costa Ricans are primarily of Spanish or mestizo ancestry with minorities of German, Nicaraguan, Italian, Jamaican, Colombian, other Central American and Greek ancestry. \n\nEuropean migrants used Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America as well to reach the USA West Coast (California) in the late 19th century and until the 1910s (before the Panama Canal opened). Other ethnic groups known to live in Costa Rica include Venezuelans, Peruvian, Brazilians, Portuguese, Palestinians, Caribbeans, Turks, Armenians and Georgians.\n\nMany of the first Spanish colonists in Costa Rica may have been Jewish converts to Christianity who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to colonial backwaters to avoid the Inquisition. The first sizable group of self-identified Jews immigrated from Poland, beginning in 1929. From the 1930s to the early 1950s, journalistic and official anti-Semitic campaigns fueled harassment of Jews; however, by the 1950s and 1960s, the immigrants won greater acceptance. Most of the 3,500 Costa Rican Jews today are not highly observant, but they remain largely endogamous.\n\nCosta Rica has four small minority groups: Mulattos, Blacks, Amerindians and Asians. About 8% of the population is of Black African descent or Mulatto (mix of European and black) who are called Afro-Costa Ricans, English-speaking descendants of 19th century black Jamaican immigrant workers.\n\nBy the late twentieth century, allusions in textbooks and political discourse to \"whiteness,\" or to Spain as the \"mother country\" of all Costa Ricans, were diminishing, replaced with a recognition of the multiplicity of peoples that make up the nation.\n\nIn Central America, systematic rape and intermarriage by European men with the Native American Indigenous Lenca, Cacaopera and Pipil women of what is now El Salvador happened almost immediately after the arrival of the European Spaniards led by Pedro de Alvarado. Other indigenous groups in the country such as Maya Poqomam people, Maya Ch'orti' people, Alaguilac, Xinca people, Mixe and Mangue language people became culturally extinct duo to the Mestizo process or diseases brought by the Spaniards. Mestizo culture quickly became the most successful and dominant culture in El Salvador. The majority of Salvadorans in modern El Salvador identify themselves as 86.3% Mestizo roots.\n\nIn 1932, ruthless dictator Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez was responsible for La Matanza (\"The Slaughter\"),known as the 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre in which the Native American indigenous people were murdered in an effort to wipe out the indigenous people in El Salvador during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising. Indigenous peoples, mostly of Lenca, Cacaopera and Pipil descent are still present in El Salvador in several communities, conserving their languages, customs, and traditions.\n\nThere is a significant Arab population (of about 100,000), mostly from Palestine (especially from the area of Bethlehem), but also from Lebanon. Salvadorans of Palestinian descent numbered around 70,000 individuals, while Salvadorans of Lebanese descent is around 27,000. There is also a small community of Jews who came to El Salvador from France, Germany, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey. Many of these Arab groups naturally mixed and contributed into the modern Salvadoran Mestizo population.\n\nPardo is the term that was used in colonial El Salvador to describe a tri-racial Afro-Mestizo person of Indigenous, European, and African descent. El Salvador is the only country in Central America that does not have a significant African population due to many factors including El Salvador not having a Caribbean coast, and because of president Maximiliano Hernández Martínez, who passed racial laws to keep blacks and other peoples out of El Salvador, though Salvadorans with African ancestry, called Pardos, were already present in El Salvador, the majority are tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans who largely cluster with the Mestizo population. They have been mixed into and were naturally bred out by the general Mestizo population, which is a combination of a Mestizo majority and the minority of Pardo people, both of whom are racially mixed populations. A total of only 10,000 African slaves were brought to El Salvador over the span of 75 years, starting around 1548, about 25 years after El Salvador's colonization. The enslaved Africans that were brought to El Salvador during the colonial times, eventually came to mix and merged into the much larger and vaster Mestizo mixed European Spanish/Native Indigenous population creating Pardo or Afromestizos who cluster with Mestizo people, contributing into the modern day Mestizo population in El Salvador, thus, there remains no significant extremes of African physiognomy among Salvadorans like there is in the other countries of Central America.\n\nToday, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as Native American indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages nor have an indigenous culture, also tri-racial Pardo Salvadorans, and Salvadoran of Arab descent, also identify themselves as culturally Salvadoran Mestizo by absorption.\n\nThe Ladino population in Guatemala is officially recognized as a distinct ethnic group, and the Ministry of Education of Guatemala uses the following definition: \n\"The ladino population has been characterized as a heterogeneous population which expresses itself in the Spanish language as a maternal language, which possesses specific cultural traits of Hispanic origin mixed with indigenous cultural elements, and dresses in a style commonly considered as western.\"\n\nInitially colonial Argentina and Uruguay had a predominately mestizo population like the rest of the Spanish colonies, but due to a flood of European migration in the 19th century, and the repeated intermarriage with white Europeans and Middle Easterners; the mestizo population became a so-called population. With more Europeans arriving in the early 20th century, the face of Argentina and Uruguay has overwhelmingly become white and European (some Middle Eastern) in culture and tradition. Because of this, the term mestizo has fallen into disuse. Northern Argentina still has a predominately mestizo population, especially in the provinces of Jujuy, Salta, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero, Catamarca, La Rioja, San Juan, Mendoza, Chaco, Formosa, Corrientes, Santa Fe and Misiones, where there is also a significant population of Indigenous peoples.\n\nIn Chile, from the time the Spanish soldiers with Pedro de Valdivia entered northern Chile, a process of 'mestizaje' began where white Spaniards began to mate with the local bellicose Mapuche population of Amerindians to produce an overwhelmingly mestizo population during the first generation in all of the cities they founded. In Southern Chile, the Mapuche, were one of the only Amerindian tribes in the Americas that were in continuous conflict with the Spanish Empire and did not submit to a European power.\n\nA public health book from the University of Chile states that 30% of the population is of Caucasian origin; mestizos are estimated to amount to a total of 65%, while Native Americans (Amerindians) comprise the remaining 5%. A genetic study by the same university showed that the average Chilean's genes are 60% Caucasian and 40% Amerindian.\n\nColombia whose land was named after explorer Christopher Columbus is the product of the interacting and mixing of the European conquistadors and colonist with the different Amerindian peoples of Colombia. Later the African element was introduced into the coastal parts of Colombia as slaves.\n\nOver time Colombia has become a primarily Mestizo/White country due to limited immigration from Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, with the minorities being: the Mulattoes and Pardos living primarily in the coastal areas; and pockets of Amerindians living around the rural areas and the Amazonian Basin regions of the country.\n\nAn extraofficial estimate considers that the 49% of the Colombian population is Mestizo or of mixed European and Amerindian ancestry. Approximately 37% is of European ancestry (predominantly Spanish, and a part of Italian, French, and German) and of Middle Eastern ancestry. 10.6% is of African ancestry. Indigenous Amerindians comprise 3.4% of the population. 0.01% of the population are Roma. The 2005 census reported that the \"non-ethnic population\", consisting of whites and mestizos (those of mixed white European and Amerindian ancestry), constituted 86% of the national population.\n\nDuring the colonial era, the majority of Ecuadorians were Amerindians and the minorities were the White Spanish Conquistadors, who came with Francisco Pizarro and Sebastian de Benalcazar. With the passage of time these Spanish conquerors and succeeding Spanish colonists sired offspring with the local Amerindian population, since Spanish immigration did not initially include many white females to the colonies. In a couple of generations a predominately mestizo population emerged in Ecuador with a drastically declining Amerindian Population due to European diseases and wars.\n\nAfro-Ecuadorians (Zambos and Mulattoes), who are a minority in the country, can be found mostly in the Esmeraldas Province, in the Valle del Chota of the Imbabura Province, and as small communities of Afro-Ecuadorians living along the coastal areas as minorities.\n\nMestizos are by far the largest of all the ethnic groups, and comprise 71.9% of the current population. The next 28% of the population is comprised by four ethnic groups with about 7% each, the Montubios, Afroecuadorian, Amerindian (Indigenous) and White.\n\nDuring the reign of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, the first consul of Paraguay from 1811 to 1840, he imposed a law that no Spaniard may intermarry with another Spaniard, and that they may only wed mestizos or Indians. This was introduced to eliminate any sense of racial superiority, and also to end the predominantly Spanish influence in Paraguay. De Francia himself was not a mestizo (although his paternal grandfather was Afro-Brazilian), but feared that racial superiority would create class division which would threaten his absolute rule.\n\nAs a result of this, today 90% of Paraguay's population are mestizo, and the main language is the native Guaraní, spoken by 60% of the population as a first language, with Spanish spoken as a first language by 40% of the population, and fluently spoken by 75%, making Paraguay one of the most bilingual countries in the world. Although it did not had the exposition to miscegenation as de Francia wanted, after the tremendous decline of male population as a result of the War of the Triple Alliance, European male worker émigrés mixed with the female mestizo population so as that pushed a middle class of Mestizo background largely accepted as a configuration of the country.\n\nAccording to Alberto Flores Galindo, \"By the 1940 census, the last that utilized racial categories, mestizos were grouped with whites, and the two constituted more than 53 % of the population. Mestizos likely outnumbered Indians and were the largest population group.\"\n\nMestizos are the majority in Venezuela, accounting for 51.6% of the country's population. According to D'Ambrosio 57.1% of mestizos have mostly European characteristics, 28.5% have mostly African characteristics and 14.2% have mostly Amerindian characteristics.\n\nMartín Cortés, son of the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés and of the Nahuatl–Maya indigenous Mexican interpreter Malinche, was one of the first documented mestizos to arrive in Spain. His first trip occurred in 1528, when he accompanied his father, Hernán Cortés, who sought to have him legitimized by the Pope.\n\nThere is also verified evidence of the grandchildren of Moctezuma II, Aztec emperor, whose royal descent the Spanish crown acknowledged, willingly having set foot on European soil. Among these descendants are the Counts of Miravalle, and the Dukes of Moctezuma de Tultengo, who became part of the Spanish peerage and left many descendants in Europe. The Counts of Miravalle, residing in Andalucía, Spain, demanded in 2003 that the government of Mexico recommence payment of the so-called 'Moctezuma pensions' it had cancelled in 1934.\n\nThe mestizo historian Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, son of Spanish conquistador Sebastián Garcilaso de la Vega and of the Inca princess Isabel Chimpo Oclloun arrived in Spain from Peru. He lived in the town of Montilla, Andalucía, where he died in 1616. The mestizo children of Francisco Pizarro were also military leaders because of their famous father. Starting in the early 19th and throughout the 1980s, France and Sweden saw the arrival of hundreds of Chileans, many of whom fled Chile during the dictatorial government of Augusto Pinochet.\n\n \nIn the Philippines, the word \"mestizo\" and usually shortened as \"Tisoy\" as a modern usage, today generally denotes Filipinos of mixed Austronesian and any non-native, usually white, ethnicity.\n\nMestizos in the Philippines are traditionally a blend of Austronesian, Chinese, Spanish, Southern European or Latin American ancestry and are primarily descendants of \"viajeros\" (sailors who plied the Manila-Acapulco Galleon route), \"soldados\" (soldiers) and \"negociantes\" (merchants who were primarily Spanish, Chinese, or themselves mestizos). Because of this, most mestizos in the Philippines are concentrated in the urban areas and large towns of the islands such as Manila, Iloilo, Zamboanga, Cebu and Vigan. In these provinces of the Philippines, many Spaniards and foreign merchants intermarried with the rich and landed MalayoPolynesian local nobilities. From these unions, a new cultural group was formed, the mestizo class. Their descendants emerged later to become an influential part of the colonial government, and of the Principalía, among whom were Manuel L. Quezon, the first President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines (1935–1944); and Marcelo Azcárraga Palmero who even became \"interim\" Prime Minister of Spain on August 8, 1897 until October 4 of that same year. Azcárraga also went on to become Prime Minister of Spain again in two more separate terms of office. In 1904, he was granted Knighthood in the very exclusive Spanish chilvalric Order of the Golden Fleece — the only mestizo recipient of this prestigious award.\n\nMore recent migrations and interracial marriages beginning in the 20th century resulted in a greater variety of racial admixture with non-Iberian Europeans, White Americans and other Asians.\n\nIn Guam and Northern Mariana Islands, the term \"mestizo\" was borrowed from the Spanish language and was formerly used to identify people of mixed Pacific Islander and Spanish ancestry; however, as the United States gained control of these islands after the Spanish–American War in 1898, the term \"Multiracial\" replaced \"Mestizo\".\n\nMestizos/Multiracials currently form a small minority of the population. Because most Guamanians and Northern Mariana Islanders were also given Spanish surnames as part of the Spanish East Indies, persons of white American and other non-Spanish European descent with Spanish surnames may be mistaken as having such descent.\n\nIn Brazil, the word is used to describe individuals born from any mixture of different ethnicities or races, not specifying any relation to Amerindian or European descent whatsoever. The Mixed Race Day, or Mestizo Day (Dia do Mestiço), on June 27, is official event in States of Amazonas, Roraima e Paraíba and a holyday in two cities.\n\nOne of the most notorious group is the (brown people), also informally known as (tan skinned people; given its euphemism-like nature, it may be interpreted as offensive). They include mostly those of non-light [and non-black] skin color. Nevertheless, not all are . For example, an Amerindian (initially and most often , often more formally , rarely , an East Indian ()) or a Filipino may be initially described as (in opposition to , white, , black, and , yellow) if his or her race is unknown, and it is testified by the initial discovery reports of Portuguese navigators. In the same way, , a term used to describe anyone with any degree of miscegenation in one's blood line, may apply to all said groups (that in Portugal and its ex-colonies, always depended solely on phenotype, meaning a brown person may have a full sibling of all other basic phenotypes and thus race groups).\n\nDescent is largely ignored, and having to choose between \"white\" and \"\" categories is a concept completely foreign to Brazilians as in the native culture it is possible to fully belong to both categories at the same time (as they describe different things). Even though all people of full European descent are white by race, not all white people are of any European descent (so that it may include few, some or most of North African, Middle Eastern, Central Asian and South Asian descent; again, phenotype is more important than descent), and neither full nor majoritary European ancestry admixed with that of people in regions where no one is white by phenotype is necessary for one to be white.\n\nAs Brazilians often believe most people to be , given how most groups have at least some minor degree of genetic exchange since what in the modern day people believe to be races were formed in the Upper Paleolithic, a term also used to explicitly explain that one has a recent major degree of miscegenation in one's blood line is .\n\nImportant groups in Brazil are the (largely contemporary usage) or (largely archaic usage), the , and the . The first group is composed of the culturally assimilated Amerindians as well as the brown-skinned descendants or children of both whites or (swarthy) people of otherwise Caucasian phenotype and Amerindians. They are an important group in the Northern (Amazon Basin) region, but also relatively numerous on the Northeastern and Center-Western ones. Then, those, neither black- nor fair-skinned, whose origins come from the admixture between whites or and blacks or . The last group is composed of descendants of Amerindians or and blacks or other . Finally, those whose origins possess a notorious level of European ancestry and in which neither Amerindian nor African phenotypical traces are much more present than each other are sometimes known as .\nThere are, however, important groups who are but not [necessarily] . People of East Asian and non-Asian descent combined are known as , from the Japanese \"love (ai) child (ko)\" (also used for all children of illegitimate birth. Mixed children are now largely referred to as \"half\" or hāfu), though often, for those without contact with the term, [East Asian nationality/ethnicity] may also be used. differ from at being fair-skinned (rather than brown-skinned), and having non-straight blond or red hair.\n\nOther people who are not brown (and thus not ), but also their phenotypes by anything other than skin, hair and eye color do not match white ones but rather those of people of color may be just referred to as , without specification to skin color with an identitarian connotation (there are the distinctions, though, of , for the fair-skinned ones, and , for those of olive skin tones). In Brazilian censuses, those people may choose to identify mostly with (white) or (brown) or leave the question on race/color blank.\n\nThe are primarily of mixed European, native born indigenous Angolan or other indigenous African lineages. They tend to be Portuguese culturally and to have full Portuguese names.\n\nAlthough they make up about two percent of the population, they are the socially elite and racially privileged group in the country. Historically, formed social and cultural allegiances with Portuguese colonists subsequently identifying with the Portuguese over and above their indigenous identities. Despite their loyalty, the ethnic group faced economic and political adversity at hands of the white population during times of economic hardship for whites. These actions lead to ostracizing Mestiços from their inherited economic benefits which sparked the group to take a new sociopolitical direction.\n\nAcross the 500 year Portuguese presence in the country, the Mestiço have retained their position of entitlement which is highly evident in the political, economic and cultural hierarchy in present-day Angola. Their phenotype range is broad with a number of members possessing physical characteristics that are close to others within the indigenous black non-mixed population. Since the Mestiços are generally better educated than the rest of the indigenous black population, they exercise influence in government disproportionate to their numbers.\n\n1% of the population is of mixed Native African and Portuguese descent, Arab and Berber genetic influence ignored.\n\nA minority population of Mozambicans of mixed Bantu and Portuguese heritage.\n\nMestiços of São Tomé and Príncipe are descendants of Portuguese colonists and African slaves brought to the islands during the early years of settlement from Benin, Gabon, the Republic of the Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Angola (these people also are known as or \"children of the land\").\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the names \"mestiços\" (Portuguese for \"mixed race\") or \"casados\" (\"married ones\") were applied to people of mixed Portuguese and Sri Lankan (Sinhalese and Tamil) descent, starting in the 16th century.\n\nA French Colonial empire in Canada, the Métis are regarded as an independent ethnic group. This community of descent consists of individuals descended from marriages of First Nation women, specifically Cree, Ojibway, and Saulteaux with Europeans, usually French, English, and Scottish laborers or merchants employed in the North American Fur Trade. Their history dates to the mid 17th century, and they have been recognized as a distinct people since the early 18th century.\n\nTraditionally, the Métis spoke a mixed language called Michif (with various regional dialects). Michif (a phonetic spelling of the Métis pronunciation of \"Métif\", a variant of Métis) is also used as the name of the Métis people. The name is most commonly applied to descendants of communities in what is now southern Manitoba. The name is also applied to the descendants of similar communities in what are now Ontario, Quebec, Labrador, and the Northwest Territories, although these groups' histories are different from that of the western Métis. In Northern Manitoba some communities spoke Bungee, a combination of Gaelic, Orcadian, Cree, and Ojibwe. Bungee is now extinct.\n\nEstimates of the number of Métis vary from 300,000 to 700,000 or more. In September 2002, the Métis people adopted a national definition of Métis for citizenship within the \"Métis Nation.\" Based on this definition, it is estimated that there are 350,000 to 400,000 Métis Nation citizens in Canada, although many Métis classify anyone as Métis who can prove that an ancestor applied for money scrip or land scrip as part of nineteenth-century treaties with the Canadian government. However, Labrador, Quebec, and even some Acadian Métis communities are not accepted by the Métis National Council and are represented nationally by the \"Congress of Aboriginal Peoples.\"\n\nThe Métis are recognized as Aboriginal, but not as a First Nation by the Canadian government and do not receive the same benefits granted to First Nation peoples. However, the 1982 amendments to the Canadian constitution recognize the Métis as an aboriginal people, and have enabled individual Métis to sue successfully for recognition of their traditional rights such as rights to hunt and trap. In 2003, a court ruling in Ontario found that the Métis deserve the same rights as other aboriginal communities in Canada.\n\nIn Saint Barthélemy, the term mestizo refers to people of mixed European (usually French) and East Asian ancestry.\n\nThe United States has a large mestizo population, as many Hispanic Americans of Mexican or Central American or South American descent are technically mestizo. However, the term \"mestizo\" is not used for official purposes, with Mexican Americans being classed in roughly equal proportions as \"white\" or \"some other race\" (see links), and the term \"mestizo\" is not in common popular use within the United States.\n\nMany Mexican-Americans use the term Chicano, which has a strong connection with their Native heritage.\n\nA 19th-century community of the Métis people of Canada, the Anglo-Métis, more commonly known as Countryborn, were children of fur traders; they typically had Orcadian, Scottish, or English fathers and Aboriginal mothers. Their first languages were generally those of their mothers: Cree, Saulteaux, Assiniboine, etc. and English. Some of their fathers spoke Gaelic or Scots, leading to the development of the dialect of English known as \"Bungee\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

The MBR is a 2-dimensional case of the minimum bounding box.\n\nMBRs are frequently used as an indication of the general position of a geographic feature or dataset, for either display, first-approximation spatial query, or spatial indexing purposes. \n\nThe degree to which an \"overlapping rectangles\" query based on MBRs will be satisfactory (in other words, produce a low number of \"false positive\" hits) will depend on the extent to which individual spatial objects occupy (fill) their associated MBR. If the MBR is full or nearly so (for example, a mapsheet aligned with axes of latitude and longitude will normally entirely fill its associated MBR in the same coordinate space), then the \"overlapping rectangles\" test will be entirely reliable for that and similar spatial objects. On the other hand, if the MBR describes a dataset consisting of a diagonal line, or a small number of disjunct points (patchy data), then most of the MBR will be empty and an \"overlapping rectangles\" test will produce a high number of false positives. One system that attempts to deal with this problem, particularly for patchy data, is c-squares.\n\nMBRs are also an essential prerequisite for the R-tree method of spatial indexing.\n\nOwing to their simplicity of expression and ease of use for searching, MBRs (frequently as \"bounding box\" or \"bounding coordinates\") are also commonly included in relevant standards for geospatial metadata, i.e. metadata that describes spatial (geographic) objects; examples include DCMI Box as an extension to the Dublin Core metadata scheme, \"Bounding Coordinates\" in the (U.S.) FGDC metadata standard, and \"Geographic Bounding Box\" in the (2003–current) ISO 19115 Metadata Standard for geographic information (ISO/TC 211). It is also (as \"boundingBox\") an element in Geography Markup Language (GML), that is utilised by a range of Web Service specifications from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). In the ISO 19107 Spatial Schema (ISO/TC 211), MBR appears as the datatype GM_Envelope that is returned by the envelope() operation on the root class GM_Object.\n\nWeb-accessible articles that deal further with the concept of the MBR include \"Unlocking the Mysteries of the Bounding Box\" by Douglas R. Caldwell, and \"Geographic Database Search Interfaces and the Equatorial Cylindrical Equidistant Projection\" by Ross S. Swick and Kenneth W. Knowles.

An eighth chapter consisting of unfinished \"fragmentary jottings,\" a foreword by Graydon Carter, Hitchens' \"Vanity Fair\" editor and an afterword by Carol Blue, Hitchens' widow, are also included in the publication.\n\nHitchens held the post of contributing editor at \"Vanity Fair\" from November 1992 until his death. In this capacity he contributed about 10 essays per year on subjects as diverse as politics and the limits of self-improvement, writing about \"anything except sports\". Therefore, he felt obliged when he was asked to write about his illness for the magazine, and managed to dispatch seven essays from \"Tumourville\" before he was overcome by his illness on 15 December 2011, aged 62. The essays take as their subject matter his fear of losing the ability to write, the torture of chemotherapy, an analysis of Nietzsche's proclamation that \"what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,\" the joy of conversation and the very meaning of life.\n\nThe critical response to \"Mortality\" was largely positive with friends and admirers of Hitchens praising both his character in confronting his death and the way that this was transferred onto the page. In a glowing review of \"Mortality\" in \"The New York Times\", Christopher Buckley described Hitchens' seven essays as \"diamond-hard and brilliant\" and \"word-perfect.\" He wrote that it was \"sobering and grief-inducing to read this brave and harrowing account of his \"year of living dyingly\" in the grip of the alien that succeeded where none of his debate opponents had in bringing him down.\" Buckley was a friend of Hitchens. Colm Tóibín fondly wrote in \"The Guardian \"of his experiences with Hitchens, opining that \"he was the best company in the world\" and offered praise for \"Mortality\", writing that \"in this book he does everything to make sure that his voice remains civilised, searching and ready to vanquish all his enemies, most notably in this case the dullness of death and its silence.\" In \"The Observer \"Alexander Linklater was also complimentary. Referring to John Gray's description of Hitchens as \"one of the greatest living writers of English prose\", Linklater responded that \"the only word of that which is certainly untrue is that Hitchens is now no longer living.\" He also noted: \"The real struggle in \"Mortality\" is not with mortality. Hitchens cleaves to the logical conclusion of his materialism. He hints, rather, at a fear of losing himself, of becoming an imbecile, someone who might, in terror and pain, say something foolish or (God forbid) religious near the end, to give his enemies satisfaction. The true struggle of his last writings is to remain himself, deep in the country of the ill, for as long as he can.\" Another positive review came from the magazine where Hitchens started his career, \"The New Statesman\". George Eaton wrote that Hitchens' final work had \"a timeless, aphoristic quality\".\n"}

In 1920, educated West Africans formed the National Congress of British West Africa, which modeled its name on the Indian National Congress. According to Ali Mazrui, the facet of the Indian independence movement West Africans found most admirable was the Indian peoples' unity during the struggle. In 1936, H. O. Davies said,\n\n\"Africans should follow India – the only way is for Africans to co-operate and make sacrifices in the struggle for freedom.\"\n\nAccording to Ali Mazrui,\n\n\"But the emergence of the Muslim League in India as a serious secessionist movement soon shattered the myth of unity in the Indian model.

Don't let us give it a chance to take root and flourish in Ghana. Down with Pakistanism!\"\n\nPakistanism became a concern in Nigeria's independence movement. The primary subdivisions of Nigeria consisted of the Hausa-Fulani-dominated Northern Region, the Yoruba-dominated Western Region, and the Igbo-dominated Eastern Region. In addition to these ethnic differences, the Northern Region was primarily Muslim, while the Western and Eastern regions were primarily Christian. In the 1950s, the Northern Region threatened to secede. Godfrey Mwakikagile noted that it was the Northern region that was the first region threatening to secede. At the 1950 General Conference at Ibadan, Northern Region delegates demanded 50% of the seat in Nigeria's legislature, and they threatened to secede if this demand was not met. In 1958, Nnamdi Azikiwe said,\n\n\"It is essential that ill-will be not created in order to encourage a Pakistan in this country.\"\n\nThe original goal of the counter-coup against the government of Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi on July 29, 1966, was to facilitate the Northern Region's secession from the rest of Nigeria.\n\nIn February 2011, Ali Mazrui used the term to describe the division of the Sudan into Sudan proper, which is primarily Muslim, and South Sudan, which is primarily Christian and animistic.\n\n"}

There are also cases of people being born with pointed ears not associated to William's syndrome. In one family a woman was born with two pointed ears, she later had a son with two less dramatically pointed ears, and she had a great uncle with one pointed ear. Some cases of pointed ears may be due to trauma to ears during labor, and the ear crease may unfold with time.\n\nPointy ears have been a characteristic of some creatures in folklore such as French croquemitaine, Brazilian curupira or Japanese earth spider. It has been a feature of characters on art as old as that of Ancient Greece and medieval Europe.\n\nPointy ears are common characteristic of many creatures in the fantasy genre. It's a common characteristics of races such as, among others, elves, faeries, pixies, hobbits, or orcs.

Popularization of the pointed ears as an attribute of elves has been attributed to the works of J. R. R. Tolkien and their more recent big screen interpretation, though the status of elvish ears as canon is not universally accepted by the Tolkien fandom.\n\nPointy ears are also found in the science fiction genre; for example among the Vulcan and Romulan races of the Star Trek universe or the Nightcrawler character from the X-Men universe.\n\n\n"}

The puppeteer may be visible to or hidden from the audience. A puppeteer can operate a puppet indirectly by the use of strings, rods, wires, electronics or directly by his or her own hands placed inside the puppet or holding it externally or any other part of the body- such as the legs. Some puppet styles require two or more puppeteers to work together to create a single puppet character.\n\nThe puppeteer's role is to manipulate the physical object in such a manner that the audience believes the object is imbued with life. In some instances, the persona of the puppeteer is also an important feature, as with ventriloquist's dummy performers, in which the puppeteer and the human figure-styled puppet appear onstage together, and in theatre shows like \"Avenue Q\".\n\nThe puppeteer might speak in the role of the puppet's character, synchronising the movements of the puppet's \"mouth\". However, there is much puppetry which does not use the moving mouth (which is a lip-sync innovation created originally for television where close-up \"headshots\" are popular). Often, in theatre, a moveable mouth is used only for gestural expression, or speech might be produced by a non-moving mouth. In traditional glove puppetry often one puppeteer will operate two puppets at a time out of a cast of several.\nMuch work is produced without any speech at all with all the emphasis on movement\n\nThe relationship between the puppeteer and the puppet-maker is similar to that between an actor and a playwright, in cases where a puppet-maker designs a puppet for a puppeteer. Very often, though, the puppeteer assumes the joint roles of puppet-maker, director, designer, writer and performer. In this case a puppeteer is a more complete theatre practitioner than is the case with other theatre forms, in which one person writes a play, another person directs it, and then actors perform the lines and gestures.\n\nPuppetry is a complex medium sometimes consisting of live performance, sometimes contributing to stop frame puppet animation, and film where performances might be technically processed as motion capture, CGI or as virtual puppetry.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "4365327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4365327", "title": "Rosenwald School", "text": "Rosenwald School\n\nIn informal usage, a Rosenwald School was any of the over five thousand schools, shops, and teachers' homes in the United States which were built primarily for the education of African-American children in the South in the early 20th century. The project was the product of the partnership of Julius Rosenwald, a Jewish American clothier who became part-owner and president of Sears, Roebuck and Company and the African American leader, educator, philanthropist and president of Tuskegee Institute, Booker T. Washington.\n\nThe need arose from the chronic underfunding of public education for African-American children in the South, as black people had been disenfranchised at the turn of the century and excluded from the political system in that region. Children were required to attend racially segregated schools.\n\nRosenwald was the founder of The Rosenwald Fund. He contributed seed money for many of the schools and other philanthropic causes, requiring local communities to raise matching funds to increase their commitment to these projects.\n\nTo promote collaboration between white and black citizens, Rosenwald required communities to commit public funds and/or labor to the schools, as well as to contribute additional cash donations. White school boards had to agree to operate and maintain the schools, and millions of dollars were raised by African-American rural communities across the South to fund better education for their children. Despite this program, by the mid-1930s, white schools in the South were worth, per student, more than five times what black schools were worth per student (in majority-black Mississippi, this ratio was more than 13 to one).\n\nIn the segregated schools of the South, African American children were sent to woefully underfunded schools. The collaboration of Rosenwald and Washington led to the construction of almost 5,000 schools for black children in the eleven states of the former Confederacy as well as Oklahoma, Missouri, Kentucky, and Maryland. As a result of their collaboration approximately one-third of African American children were educated in these schools.\n\nThe Rosenwald-Washington model required the buy-in of African American communities as well as the support of white governing bodies. Black communities raised more than $4.7 million to aid in construction , plus often donating land and labor. Research has found that the Rosenwald program accounts for a sizable portion of the educational gains of rural Southern black persons in this period. This research also found significant effects on school attendance, literacy, years of schooling, cognitive test scores, and Northern migration, with gains highest in the most disadvantaged counties.\n\nJulius Rosenwald (1862–1932) was born to a German-Jewish immigrant family. He became a clothier by trade after learning the business from relatives in New York City. His first business went bankrupt; however, another he began in Chicago, Illinois became a leading supplier to Richard Sears' business. Sears, Roebuck and Company was a growing mail-order business which served many rural Americans. Anticipating demand by using the variations of sizes in American men and their clothing determined during the American Civil War, Rosenwald helped plan the growth in what many years later marketers would call \"the softer side of Sears\": clothing. In 1895, he became one of its investors, eventually serving as the president of Sears from 1908 to 1922. He was its chairman until his death in 1932.\n\nAfter the 1906 reorganization of the Sears company as a public stock corporation by the financial services firm of Goldman Sachs, one of the senior partners, Paul Sachs, often stayed with the Rosenwald family at their home during his many trips to Chicago. Julius Rosenwald and Sachs would often discuss America's social situation, agreeing that the plight of African Americans was the most serious problem in the United States. The millions in the South had been disenfranchised at the turn of the century and suffered second-class status in a system of Jim Crow segregation. Black public schools and other facilities were chronically underfunded.\n\nSachs introduced Rosenwald to Booker T. Washington, (1856 - 1915) the famed educator who in 1881 started as the first principal of the normal school which he developed as Tuskegee University in Alabama. Washington, who had gained the respect of many American leaders including U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, had also obtained financial support from wealthy philanthropists such as Andrew Carnegie, George Eastman and Henry Huttleston Rogers. He encouraged Rosenwald, as he had others, to address the poor state of African-American education in the U.S.\n\nIn 1912, Rosenwald was asked to serve on the Board of Directors of Tuskegee, a position he held until his death in 1932. Rosenwald endowed Tuskegee so that Washington could spend less time traveling to seek funding and devote more time toward management of the school. As urged by Washington, Rosenwald provided funds for the construction of six small schools in rural Alabama, which were constructed and opened in 1913 and 1914 and overseen by Tuskegee.\n\nJulius Rosenwald and his family established The Rosenwald Fund in 1917 for \"the well-being of mankind.\" Unlike other endowed foundations, which were designed to fund themselves in perpetuity, The Rosenwald Fund was intended to use all of its funds for philanthropic purposes. It donated over 70 million dollars to public schools, colleges and universities, museums, Jewish charities and black institutions before funds were completely depleted in 1948.\n\nThe school building program was one of the largest programs administered by the Rosenwald Fund. Using state-of-the-art architectural plans designed by professors at Tuskegee Institute, the Fund spent more than four million dollars to build 4,977 schools, 217 teachers' homes, and 163 shop buildings in 883 counties in 15 states, from Maryland to Texas. The Rosenwald Fund was based on a system of matching grants, requiring white school boards to commit to maintenance and black communities to aid in construction.\n\nIn some communities, surviving structures have been preserved because of the deep meaning they had for African Americans as symbols of their leaders' and communities' dedication to education. Others were threatened by lack of funds in rural areas, urbanization and changes in demographics, changing style of education to consolidated and integrated schools, and other social changes. \n\nFormer Rosenwald students have led some efforts to preserve Rosenwald Schools. For example, in Georgia, three former Rosenwald Schools were preserved by the efforts of former students and Georgia's Historic Preservation Division, leading to their being listed on the National Register of Historic Places by 2001.\n\nIn 2002, the National Trust for Historic Preservation named Rosenwald Schools near the top of the country's most endangered places and created a campaign to raise awareness and money for preservation. At least 60 former Rosenwald Schools are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2015 the National Trust classified the Rosenwald Schools as National Treasures.\n\nIn Georgia, several Rosenwald School sites have been commemorated through the Georgia Historical Marker Program, currently administered by the Georgia Historical Society. In partnership with community organizations, markers have been erected for the Hiram Rosenwald School (2006, Paulding County), Macon County Training School (2016, Macon County), Barney Colored Elementary School (2013, Brooks County), and Noble Hill Rosenwald School (1995 by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, Bartow County).\n\nSome schools have been adapted for new uses. Walnut Cove Colored School in Stokes County, North Carolina won a National Preservation Honor Award for its rehabilitation for use as a senior citizens' community center. The Hope Rosenwald School in Pomaria, South Carolina will also be used as a community center. The Highland Park School in Prince George's County, Maryland had been in continuous use by the school system. It was recently renovated for use as a Headstart Center. The Canetuck Rosenwald School in Currie, North Carolina has been renovated by the local Black community and is used as a busy community center. The Beauregard Parish Training School in DeRidder, Louisiana was renovated with a federal grant in 2007 and open in 2009 as \"BeauCare Head Start\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "374248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=374248", "title": "Seibal", "text": "Seibal\n\nSeibal (), known as El Ceibal in Spanish, is a Classic Period archaeological site of the Maya civilization located in the northern Petén Department of Guatemala, about 100 km SW of Tikal. It was the largest city in the Pasión River region.\n\nThe site was occupied from the Preclassic Period through to the Terminal Classic, with a significant hiatus. The principal phase of occupation dates to the Late Preclassic (400 BC – AD 200), followed by a decline in the Early Classic (AD 200–600). Seibal experienced a significant recovery in the Terminal Classic immediately prior to its complete abandonment, reaching its second peak from about 830 to 890, with a population estimated at 8–10,000 people. The dates on the stelae at Seibal are unusually late, with monuments still being dedicated after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the Petén region. Many of Seibal's late monuments show artistic influence from central Mexico and from the Gulf Coast of Mexico.\n\nThe early history of the site is lost due to the catastrophic defeat of the polity in AD 735 by the nearby Petexbatun kingdom with its capital at Dos Pilas, resulting in the destruction of its earlier sculpted monuments. Seibal was reduced to being a vassal state until the destruction of the Petexbatun kingdom in the late 8th century AD. In AD 830 a new elite installed itself at the site with the arrival of Wat'ul Chatel from Ucanal to the east. This new arrival reinvigorated Seibal and allowed it to last to the dawn of the 10th century, well after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the region.\n\n\"Seibal\" is a corruption of the Spanish word \"ceibal\", meaning \"place where many ceiba trees grow\". \"El Ceibal\" was the name of a lumber camp near the ruins at the time of their discovery. The change in spelling originated with a publication by Teoberto Maler in 1908, which used a Germanic form with initial \"s\".\n\nSeibal is located on bluffs about above the Pasión River, a major tributary of the Usumacinta River. About downstream, the Pasión River joins with the Salinas River to form the Usumacinta, which flows northwards to the Gulf of Mexico. The site lies in the Petén department of northern Guatemala, east of the modern town of Sayaxché. Seibal lay east of the Late Classic city of Dos Pilas and south of Tikal. Lake Petén Itzá lies to the north of the ruins.\n\nSeibal lies among tropical rainforest on a limestone plain that is intermittently hilly and flat.\n\nSurveys have revealed an average of 436 structures per square kilometer (1118 per square mile) in the site core, falling to 244 structures/km² (626/square mile) in the periphery. At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through the periphery, to produce an estimated total population of almost ten thousand. In the Early Classic the population suffered a severe decline, population is estimated to have dropped to 34% of peak population. In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion that appears to have occurred rapidly and spread to all parts of the site, perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830. This was followed by a population crash to 14% of peak Preclassic population in the Early Postclassic (AD 900–1200) prior to the complete abandonment of the site.\n\nThe social stratification of Seibal was that of priest-kings, as well as nobility and elites living in the main ceremonial center, with the common people living in the peripheries of the city. During the 1964-68 excavations, 34 of the 45 found burials were from the peripheral zone, showing the distribution of population by class.\n\nAll dates A.D.\nThe site was occupied by the Middle Preclassic, then declined from the Late Preclassic through to the Early Classic, with a renewed expansion in the Late to Terminal Classic before being completely abandoned.\n\nSeibal was first settled around 900 BC in the Preclassic Period. It reached its peak population in the Late Preclassic around 200 BC, at the end of the Cantuse ceramic phase (300-200 CE). Ceramics from the deep Middle Preclassic levels at Seibal belong to the little-known Real/Xe phase, found in the western Petén region. A cruciform Olmec-style cache consisting of a bloodletter and jade celts is similar to those found in the Olmec heartland on the Gulf Coast of Mexico, and the artifacts were probably manufactured at La Venta. This cache dates to approximately 900 BC.\nAfter the Real/Xe complex, came the Escoba period, dating to approximately 600CE-300CE. The ceramics between these two periods are similar, but Escoba ceramics are more extensive and stratigraphically separated. There is also evidence during this time of the population increase that would peak at the end of the Cantutse period.\n\nThe earliest settlement in the Middle Preclassic was mostly confined to Group A. After 300 BC, in the Late Preclassic, settlement expanded to include Group D. During this period, there is evidence of ceremonial structures being build both in Group A and D.\n\nBy the end of the Late Preclassic (or Protoclassic), Seibal experienced an unexplained decline in population.\n\nDuring the Early Classic, the decline that began in the Late Preclassic continued unabated until the site was all but abandoned around AD 300 for unknown reasons.\n\nSeibal underwent a revival in the Late Classic with an expansion of occupation linked to the great city of Tikal. About AD 650 new inhabitants moved into the city in order to found a new kingdom. Groups A and D saw new construction, with a particular emphasis on Group D, which became an important part of the ceremonial centre. Any monuments raised by the Late Classic rulers responsible for this renewed occupation were defaced when the city suffered a catastrophic defeat in the 8th century AD.\nAfter the defeat of Seibal, foreign influences can be seen from Central Mexico in the art and stelae of the site dating to the Bayal phase (mid-700 CE-post-classic).\n\nThe earliest mention of Seibal in hieroglyphic inscriptions is on Stela 15 at Dos Pilas, dated to 13 October 721, and refers to Seibal becoming involved in the long-running war between the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul and their respective allies and vassals. Dos Pilas was a newly founded city in the Petexbatún region, established by Tikal to exert its control over the Pasión River, a strategy that backfired when Calakmul seized control of the fledgling kingdom.\n\nIn AD 735 Ucha'an K'in B'alam, the third king of Dos Pilas, attacked Seibal, capturing Yich'aak B'alam. The captive king was not executed but rather became a vassal of his more powerful neighbour. Ucha'an K'in B'alam raised monuments to his victory over Seibal at Dos Pilas, Aguateca and Seibal itself. Yich'aak B'alam is shown under the feet of Ucha'an K'in B'alam on Aguateca Stela 2. At Seibal a hieroglyphic stairway was built recording the city's new status as a vassal of Dos Pilas. At the same time as he erected these monuments to his victory, Ucha'an K'in B'alam ordered the destruction of the hieroglyphic records on the earlier monuments of Seibal, with inscriptions at Dos Pilas and Aguateca specifically recording the destruction of Seibal's previously recorded history using phrases that translate as \"they destroyed the writing\" and \"they chopped the writing off the statues that were made\".\n\nYich'aak B'alam continued as a vassal under the next king of Dos Pilas, K'awiil Chan K'inich, who presided over rituals at Seibal in 745 and 747.\n\nSeibal regained its independence in the late 8th century with the destruction of the Dos Pilas kingdom. Ajaw B'ot acceded to the throne in AD 771, restoring Seibal as an independent capital. After AD 800 Seibal fell into a thirty-year hiatus during which no new monuments were erected.\n\nWith its independence came a new apogee, and for a brief time Seibal became a prominent regional capital located on the important Pasión River trade route. The architecture and ceramics from this period demonstrate connections with the northern Yucatán Peninsula and the Gulf Coast of Mexico. Seventeen stelae carved between AD 849 and 889 show a mix of Maya and foreign styles, including a lord wearing the beaked mask of Ehecatl, the central Mexican wind god, with a Mexican-style speech scroll emerging from the mouth, carvings of foreign-style foot slippers, and squared cartouches. Some of these stelae have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at Cacaxtla, a site in the central Mexican state of Tlaxcala. This hybrid style seem to indicate that the new lords of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources. Some of the more foreign-looking stelae even bear non-Maya calendrical glyphs. Changes at Seibal at this time are associated with the Chontal-controlled trade flowing along the Pasión River. The Chontal Maya themselves were warrior-merchants originating from the Gulf Coast of Mexico who displayed a mixture of Maya and non-Maya characteristics.\n\nHieroglyphic texts at Seibal indicate that the city's newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of Caracol and Ucanal in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse. It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its defensible location overlooking the Pasión River. Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul. Wat'ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement to the south of the Central Plaza of Group A. Structure A-3 consists of a low radial pyramid with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.\n\nWat'ul Chatel's last monument was erected in 889. This stela is also the last dated monument raised at Seibal and by 900 the city was all but abandoned, the whole region had been engulfed by the Classic Maya collapse and trade no longer flowed along the Pasión-Usumacinta route. Most Classic Maya capitals had already been abandoned and whatever external support Seibal had received from its overlord had vanished. By 930 AD, the site was completely abandoned. It was left relatively undisturbed until around 1890 when Federico Artes was informed of the city’s ruins.\n\nThe late stelae at Seibal show a marked reduction in quality over a span of about forty years, with the loss of Classic Period traits, and bearing flatter and cruder representations than earlier stelae. This may reflect the loss of expertise in the Terminal Classic, with craftsmen less able to work monuments and large structures as time progressed.\n\nThe ruins of Seibal were probably discovered around 1890 by loggers working for the Hamett Mahogany Company. Federico Arthes, an owner of logging company Arthes and Sons, first reported the existence of the ruins of Saxtanquiqui, the Maya name of the site, in 1892 in a public article for the Guatemala City paper. He resided and did business in the Peten. The Guatemalan government nominated Senor Arthes Comisionado Especial to collect material to be displayed in the Guatemalan exhibit for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. He was having very little luck getting satisfactory material at Tikal due to lack of available water for the plaster casting at which point he traveled to Saxtanquiqui with Gorgonio Lopez Toledo, a former assistant to Alfred Maudley. He took molds from some of the stelae and the resulting casts were displayed in the Exposition, bringing the recent discovery of the ruins to the attention of archaeologists for the first time. After the exposition closed, the casts were given to the Peabody Museum. Photographs of the stelae are still catalogued under the name \"Sactankiki\", the western spelling used by Maler after his expedition but a name he later wrote about with derision.\n\nTwo years later, in July 1895, Seibal was explored by Teoberto Maler on behalf of the Peabody Museum of Harvard University. He made a site plan and discovered a new stela to add to those already discovered. He returned to the site for further investigations in August 1905 but discovered no new monuments. The Peabody Museum published Maler's work in 1908, including good quality photos of the stelae.\n\nSeibal was next investigated by Sylvanus Morley in 1914 on behalf of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Dr Barnum Brown visited the ruins in 1948, and members of the Altar de Sacrificios Expedition of the Peabody Museum made visits in 1961, 1962 and 1963.\n\nIn 1964, the Peabody Museum returned to the site with a thorough investigation that continued until 1968, led by Gordon R. Willey as director and A. Ledyard Smith as field director. Further excavations were carried out from May to June in 2006 by the Proyecto Arqueológico Ceibal-Petexbatun (Seibal-Petexbatun Archaeological Project).\n\nSeibal is a medium-sized site. The site core is divided into three principal hilltop groups (Groups A, C and D) connected by causeways and covers a little over 1 km². The causeways were faced with masonry and had parapets in places. Causeway I is the western causeway, Causeway II is the south causeway and Causeway III is the eastern causeway. Group D is a fortress refuge concealed above the river frontage. Group B is a small complex located about from the site core. Group A is smaller than Group D but has most of the sculptured monuments. Various small housemound groups lie beyond the site core. They are spaced between apart, extending for several kilometers to the north, south and west.\n\nOnly two structures have been restored at Seibal, the A-3 temple platform and the C-79 circular platform, topped with the Jaguar Altar. Both were restored during the investigations carried out by the Peabody Museum in the 1960s.\n\nSeibal possesses a satellite site located to the north, known as El Anonal. This site has large structures built from clay that date to the Middle Preclassic period.\n\nGroup A is in the site core. It features three plazas, the North, South and Central Plazas and lies at the west end of Causeway I. Group A has more than fifty mounds arranged around the three plazas. Monuments dating to the period when Seibal was a vassal of Dos Pilas (AD 735–761) are situated in the Central Plaza of the group. In this group, there is also a ball court that is dated to the Terminal Classic and stylistically resembles that at Uxmal.\n\nGroup C lies on Causeway II, which passes through it to end at the circular Structure C-79. Group C has over forty mounds.\n\nGroup D is a compact group at the east end of Causeway III, it is perched in an easily defensible position at the edge of the bluffs overlooking the Pasión river. It has more than seventy structures crowded around five plazas. Group D only had one stela, which was a plain monument erected in front of a high stepped pyramid.\n\nThe East Patio of Group A is part of an acropolis complex located behind Structure A-14. The complex is situated upon a massive platform raised almost above the natural surface level. The patio was accessed by a stairway on the south side. It includes Structures A-15 and A-16.\nStructure A-3 is a temple platform located in the centre of the south plaza. It has a stairway ascending each of its four sides. Five stelae are associated with this structure, one located at the base of each stairway and a fifth inside the building surmounting the platform. Three large jade cobbles were interred under the central stela. This structure and its associated stelae were dedicated in AD 849 by king Wat'ul Chatel (also known as Aj B'olon Haab'tal). Structure A-3 has the remains of a corbeled vault, the only surviving example at Seibal. The arrangement of the radial pyramid with its associated stelae was highly innovative. The radial temple form was ancient in the Maya region, dating back to the Late Preclassic, but Wat'ul Chatel placed upon it a square shrine with four doors, one opening onto each of the stairways. The temple building contained three vaulted chambers oriented north-south, with doors joining each chamber along an east-west axis. The cornice of the temple supported a brightly coloured stucco frieze. The frieze collapsed with the temple in ancient times. Archaeologists were able to recover portions of the fallen frieze and attempt a reconstruction of how it originally appeared. Each of the four doors was originally topped by a larger-than-life sculpture of king Wat'ul Chatel. Twelve smaller figures were spaced around the cornice, one at each corner with an additional figure positioned half-way between each corner and the central figure of the king. It is not known who these smaller figures represented. The spaces between the figures were occupied by panels with cross-hatch designs and sculpted vegetation and animals. Old gods sat in the centre of each of the sixteen panels, including Itzamna and Pawatun. Structure A-3 was built over an earlier platform structure.\n\nStructure A-10, a tall temple-pyramid, is the tallest structure at the site.\n\nStructure A-13 is a radial pyramid. Excavations uncovered a mass burial (Burial 4) with parts of eleven people, including two women and a child. This was not a traditional Classic Maya burial and has been dated to AD 930, very late in the occupation of the site.\n\nStructure A-14 is covered by the forest that has overgrown the northern part of the Central Plaza. It is a range structure running north-south and once had a hieroglyphic stairway detailing Seibal's defeat by Dos Pilas, although the inscriptions have now been removed to the old project camp. The structure was found to contain an elite female burial, labelled as Burial 1.\n\nStructure A-15 is located on the north side of the East Patio of the North Plaza. It is a long, low structure running east-west and closing the patio on the north side. It measures by tall. The building contained a long room with a wide entrance opening southwards onto the patio, raised from the patio by a step. The room contained a stone bench built from reused blocks. The structure was superimposed upon two earlier substructures, the earliest of which had a different orientation to the final building. All three periods of construction appear to date to the Terminal Classic, with the last phase perhaps dating to about the time of the fall of the city.\n\nStructure A-16 is located on the northeast side of the East Patio of the North Plaza. It is a rectangular structure measuring , running north-south and facing to the west. The remains of the structure stand high. The western side of the building had been damaged by looters prior to archaeological investigation. The looters' trench measured by deep and cut through the structure's floor, bench and rear wall but did not uncover any burials or offerings. Fallen limestone blocks and slabs reveal that the structure once had a corbel-vaulted chamber. Fragments of stucco were also recovered, they once made up a colourful frieze above the front of the building that included modelled human figures. The stucco still had traces of orange, green and yellow paint. The building was a palace-type structure with perhaps six rooms, three on the west side and three on the east, and it was originally roofed in stone. The interior had an L-shaped bench. The structure was built of finely cut limestone blocks and the walls were coated with stucco painted orange and turquoise. It is believed that the building was part of a Terminal Classic royal palace with architectural features similar to those of the temple Structure A-3.\nStructure A-19 and Structure C-9 are ballcourts. They have a resemblance to ballcourts at Chichen Itza. Both ballcourts are aligned east-west, an unusual feature in the Maya area, although the topography of the site severely restricted the layout of the city to a principally east-west orientation. Ballcourt A-19 lies on the west side on the north plaza.\n\nStructure C-79 is a circular three-tiered platform built during the Terminal Classic on top of a pre-existing structure dating to the Late Preclassic Period. Circular structures such as this have their origin in central Mexico, where they are typically temples of Ehecatl, the god of wind. However, the structure at Seibal was surmounted by a rectangular building platform, whereas the temple buildings of Ehecatl were also circular. Structure C-79 has two stairways, the larger ascends the west side, the smaller is on the east side. A circular jaguar altar rests on three pedestals before the structure, two of these are crouching figures that originally supported the altar, the third central column is modern and was put in place as an additional support during restoration of the ruins. The altar has the crude representation of a jaguar's head carved onto its edge. Structure C-79 and the associated altar are dated to about AD 870.\n\nThe monuments of Seibal include a number of stelae, carved stone shafts, often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs. The monuments at Seibal are fashioned from a hard limestone, accounting for their generally excellent preservation. During excavations in the 1960s, 57 stelae were identified. Of these 22 were sculpted and 35 were plain.\n\nHieroglyphic Stairway 1 was located on the front of Structure A-14. The stairway was installed by king Ucha'an K'in B'alam of Dos Pilas to record Seibal's status as a vassal after its defeat by that city. The stones are no longer \"in situ\", having been removed to the area of the camp of the old archaeological project.\n\nStela 1, on the north side of the South Plaza near Structure A-3, names someone called \"Knife-Wing\", who is also known at distant Chichen Itza. It is dated to AD 869.\n\nStela 2 is believed to date to around AD 870 although it bears no hieroglyphic text. It depicts the frontal view of a masked figure and is the only monument at Seibal to show a frontal portrayal. It was broken into six or seven pieces and has been restored.\n\nStela 3 bears a non-Maya calendrical date, one of the glyphs is \"cipactli\", a crocodile head used to represent the first day of the 260-day calendar in central Mexico. This stela once stood next to Stela 2 but was removed to a museum in Guatemala City.\n\nStela 4 is badly damaged, having been broken into pieces by a falling tree. It was lost for sixty years before being rediscovered. It currently remains buried under a thin covering of soil.\n\nStela 5 lies to the north of the South Plaza and is badly damaged. The broken middle section of the stela is all that is left, it bears the representation of a ballplayer and dates to about AD 780.\n\nStela 6 is slightly to the north of Stela 5, bearing hieroglyphic text. This stela was damaged in antiquity when the upper part was broken off and erected by an altar nearby.\n\nStela 7 stands to the north of stelae 5 and 6. It is in a reasonable state of preservation and bears the image of a ruler dressed as a ballplayer. This monument was probably dedicated in AD 780, although it records the accession of a king of Seibal in AD 771.\n\nStela 8 is a well-preserved monument on the south side of Structure A-3. Here king Wat'ul Chatel wears jaguar claws on his hands and feet, together with other attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God. In one hand the king holds the head of the god K'awiil. The text describes a visitor named Hakawitzil, an early form of Jacawitz, the name of one of the patron gods of the Postclassic K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands. Schele and Mathews propose that the event depicted on this stela gave rise to the foundation legends of the K'iche' people.\n\nStela 9 was erected on the west side of Structure A-3. It is badly damaged and one section is missing. The stela depicts Wat'ul Chatel with the attributes of the Maize God and describes him invoking the Vision Serpent.\n\nStela 10 is on the north side of Structure A-3. It depicts Wat'ul Chatel, dressed in Terminal Classic Maya style, although his foreign-looking face bears a moustache, which is not a typically Mayan characteristic. The text on this stela displays the emblem glyphs of Tikal, Calakmul and Motul de San José, describing how he received visitors from those cities. Among the visitors are named Kan-Pet of Calakmul and Kan Ek' of Motul. Wat'ul Chatel wears a headdress associated with the patron gods of Seibal, the heron god and K'awiil, deities that were also the patrons of Palenque. This appears to be an attempt by this foreign king to identify himself more closely with the city he came to rule.\n\nStela 11 is on the east side of Structure A-3 and describes the refounding of Seibal on 14 March 830 and the installation of its new lord, Wat'ul Chatel, as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal. A panel beneath the portrait of the ruler depicts a bound captive. The hieroglyphic inscription describes how Wat'ul Chatel arrived with his palanquins and his patron deities.\n\nStela 13 stands a little to the west of the South Plaza. It dates to AD 870.\n\nStela 14 dates to about AD 870 and stands at the junction of two causeways and is in a good state of preservation. It has stylistic similarities with sculptures at distant Chichen Itza in the extreme north of the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\nStela 18 is one of the last stelae to be erected at Seibal, it lies west of the group of monuments consisting of Stelae 5, 6 and 7.\n\nStela 19 demonstrates the foreign influences prevalent at Seibal during the Late Classic. It depicts a lord wearing a mask representing the central Mexican wind god Ehecatl.\n\nStela 20 stands to the west of the South Plaza. It was one of the last monuments to be erected at Seibal, dating to AD 889.\n\nStela 21 is located inside the chamber at the top of Structure A-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber collapsed on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela 8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand hands a shield with the face of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.\n\n\n"}

Ron Hubbard, released in 1982. Hubbard composed the music for the album.\n\nBesides its own particular contents, the album is known for being the first soundtrack ever written for a book.\n\nThe album was recorded in Los Angeles in 1982 and released by Applause Records. A 1983 press release put out by the Church of Spiritual Technology subsidiary company Author Services Inc. marketed the concept album as \"the only original sound track ever produced for a book before it becomes a movie\". The album includes performances by prominent musicians Chick Corea (keyboards), Stanley Clarke (bass), Nicky Hopkins (keyboards) and Gayle Moran (keyboards/vocals). Hopkins was known for his work in rock and roll, the others mainly as jazz musicians; all were, at the time, associated with Scientology. The album features extensive use of the Fairlight CMI synthesizer. A demonstration of the \"computer space jazz\" soundtrack was one of the festival displays at the 1982 US Festival rock concert in California.\n\nL. Ron Hubbard's son Ronald DeWolf filed a probate case in November 1982, after his father had not made any public appearances since 1980, requesting to be appointed trustee of Hubbard's estate on the grounds that his father was missing or dead. In 1983, attorneys representing Hubbard produced a letter in Hubbard's handwriting and with his fingerprints, in which he wrote that he had not had a leadership role in the Church of Scientology for \"nearly 17 years\", and mentioned his new novel \"Battlefield Earth\", his recently released album \"Space Jazz\", and 10-volume novel \"Mission Earth\". \"I am actively writing, having published \"Battlefield Earth\", and my \"Space Jazz\" album; a projected ten-volume work, \"Mission Earth\", is in the pre-publication stage at the moment\", said Hubbard's statement. In conjunction with the release of Hubbard's letter, Church of Scientology President Heber Jentzsch told the press that Hubbard had produced \"Space Jazz\" around December 1982, and wrote the majority of songs and lyrics for the computer-based music on the album.\n\nIn 1984, the LP was retitled to \"Battlefield Earth\". According to a 1987 statement from Norman F. Starkey, the executor of Hubbard's estate, the copyright to Hubbard's works passed to the Church of Scientology after his death. In addition to copyright of \"Space Jazz\", other copyrighted music titles by Hubbard included \"Tarzan\", \"The Black Cape\" and \"Snake Head\".\n\nA 1983 review of the work for \"Stereo Review\" commented that the wording used in the jacket copy of the album was \"hyperbolic\". In a 2003 review for \"Locus Online\", Jeff Berkwits noted: \"The eclectic 1982 album is reportedly the first soundtrack ever written for a book, and highlights performances from jazz greats Chick Corea and Stanley Clarke\". A copy of \"Space Jazz\" was given out to the first prize recipient in the 2006 Worst Record competition by the New Jersey newspaper the \"Hunterdon Democrat\".\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18411985", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18411985", "title": "Structuralism (architecture)", "text": "Structuralism (architecture)\n\nStructuralism is a movement in architecture and urban planning evolved around the middle of the 20th century. It was a reaction to CIAM-Functionalism (Rationalism) which had led to a lifeless expression of urban planning that ignored the identity of the inhabitants and urban forms.\n\nStructuralism in a general sense is a mode of thought of the 20th century, which came about in different places, at different times and in different fields. It can also be found in linguistics, anthropology, philosophy and art. At the beginning of the general article Structuralism the following explanations are noted:\n\n\"Structuralism is a theoretical paradigm emphasizing that elements of culture must be understood in terms of their relationship to a larger, overarching system or structure.\"\n\nAlternately, as summarized by philosopher Simon Blackburn, \"Structuralism is the belief that phenomena of human life are not intelligible except through their interrelations. These relations constitute a structure, and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture.\"\n\nIn Europe, structuralism is seen as a parallel movement to American postmodern architecture. The first interpretations of both movements came up in the 1960s. Through publications and presentations by authors such as Charles Jencks, Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, postmodern architecture was successful throughout the world for decades. While postmodernism is concerned with an architectural style, many aspects of architecture and urbanism are treated in the structuralist movement.\n\nIn contrast to the postmodern movement, structuralism has developed more slowly, less noticeably during several periods in the last decades. The theoretical contributions of structuralism were developed in Europe, Japan, US and Canada. In 2011, the first comprehensive compilation of structuralist activity appeared in a publication called \"Structuralism Reloaded\". In this extensive book, articles by 47 international authors were published about philosophical, historical, artistic and other relevant aspects. The selecting process for all these different views, including what is more or less important, needs time to give a definitive overall picture of structuralism. The following parts of this article are based on the current state of the publication \"Structuralism Reloaded\".\n\nA few months after publishing this book, the RIBA Institute in London discussed the new candidates for the RIBA Gold Medal in 2012. An actual question was: \"Should the Venturis be given this year's RIBA Gold Medal?\" Surprisingly enough, the RIBA-committee did not award the Venturis with their postmodernist view, and instead, gave Herman Hertzberger the prize for his structuralist architecture and theoretical contributions. The times had changed and a shift in emphasis had occurred. The comment of the former RIBA president Jack Pringle was: \"The Royal Gold Medal, Britain's most prestigious award, should go to an architect that has taken us forward, not backwards.\" Today, postmodern architecture can be compared, to some degree with the architectural movement, Traditionalismus, in Europe.\n\nThe anthropologist, Claude Lévi-Strauss, remarked: \"I do not believe that we can still speak of one structuralism. There were a lot of movements that claimed to be structuralist.\" This diversity can also be found in architecture. However, architectural structuralism has an autonomy that does not comply with all the principles of structuralism in human sciences. In architecture, the different directions have created different images. In this article two directions are discussed. Sometimes these occur in combination.\n\nOn the one hand, there is the Aesthetics of Number which was formulated by Aldo van Eyck in 1959. This concept can be compared to cellular tissue. The most influential prototype of this direction is the orphanage in Amsterdam by Aldo van Eyck, completed in 1960. The \"Aesthetics of Number\" can also be described as \"Spatial Configurations in Architecture\" or \"Mat-Building\" (Alison Smithson).\n\nOn the other hand, there is the Architecture of Lively Variety (Structure and Coincidence) which was formulated for user participation in housing by John Habraken in 1961. Also, in the 1960s, many well-known utopian projects were based on the principle of \"Structure and Coincidence\". The most influential prototype of this direction is the Yamanashi Culture Chamber in Kofu by Kenzo Tange, completed in 1967. Similar notions of \"Architecture of Lively Variety\" are: \"Architecture of Diversity\", \"Pluralistic Architecture\", \"Two-Components-Approach\" or \"Open Structures\".\n\nStructuralism in architecture and urban planning had its origins in the Congrès International d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) after World War II. Between 1928 and 1959, the CIAM was an important platform for the discussion of architecture and urbanism. Various groups with often conflicting views were active in this organization; for example, members with a scientific approach to architecture without aesthetic premises (Rationalists), members who regarded architecture as an art form (Le Corbusier), members who were proponents of high- or low-rise building (Ernst May), members supporting a course of reform after World War II (Team 10), members of the old guard and so on.\nIndividual members of the small splinter group Team 10 laid the foundations for Structuralism. The influence of this team was later interpreted by second generation protagonist Herman Hertzberger when he said: \"I am a product of Team 10.\" As a group of avant-garde architects, Team 10 was active from 1953 to 1981, and two different movements emerged from it: the New Brutalism of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the Structuralism of the Dutch members (Aldo van Eyck and Jacob Bakema).\n\nOutside Team 10, other ideas developed that furthered the Structuralist movement - influenced by the concepts of Louis Kahn in the United States, Kenzo Tange in Japan and John Habraken in the Netherlands (with his theory of user participation in housing). Herman Hertzberger and Lucien Kroll made important architectural contributions in the field of participation.\n\nIn 1960, the Japanese architect Kenzo Tange designed his well-known Tokyo Bay Plan. Reflecting later on the initial phase of that project, he said: \"It was, I believe, around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that I began to think about what I was later to call Structuralism.\" Tange also wrote the article \"Function, Structure and Symbol, 1966\", in which he describes the transition from a functional to a structural approach in thinking. Tange considers the period from 1920 to 1960 under the heading of \"Functionalism\" and the time from 1960 onwards under the heading of \"Structuralism\".\n\nLe Corbusier created several early projects and built prototypes in a Structuralist mode, some of them dating back to the 1920s. Although he was criticized by the members of Team 10 in the 1950s for certain aspects of his work (urban concept without a \"sense of place\" and the dark interior streets of the Unité), they nevertheless acknowledged him as a great model and creative personality in architecture and art.\n\nOne of the most influential manifestos for the Structuralist movement was compiled by Aldo van Eyck in the architectural magazine \"Forum\" 7/1959. It was drawn up as the programme for the International Congress of Architects in Otterlo in 1959. The central aspect of this issue of \"Forum\" was a frontal attack on the Dutch representatives of CIAM-Rationalism who were responsible for the reconstruction work after World War II, (for tactical reasons, planners like van Tijen, van Eesteren, Merkelbach and others were not mentioned). The magazine contains many examples of and statements in favour of a more human form of urban planning. This congress in 1959 marks the official start of Structuralism, although earlier projects and buildings did exist. Only since 1969 has the term \"Structuralism\" been used in publications in relation to architecture.\n\nSome presentations and discussions that took place during the Otterlo Congress in 1959 are seen as the beginning of Structuralism in architecture and urbanism. These presentations had an international influence. In the book \"CIAM '59 in Otterlo\" the names of the 43 participating architects are listed. While the term structuralism in architecture was published for the first time in 1969.\n\nL. Miquel, Alger / Aldo van Eyck, Amsterdam / José A.

Sekler, Wien / Radovan Niksic, Zagreb / Alfred Roth, Zurich\n\nSince structuralism has different directions, there is more than one definition. The theoretical contribution by Herman Hertzberger belongs to the most interesting versions. A recent and often cited statement by Hertzberger is: \"In Structuralism, one differentiates between a structure with a long life cycle and infills with shorter life cycles.\" \n\nA more detailed description by Hertzberger is published in 1973. It is a structuralist definition in a general sense, but also the basis concept for user participation: \"The fact that we put 'form' in a central position with respect to such notions as 'space' or 'architecture', means in itself no more than a shifting of accent. What we are talking about is in fact another notion of form than that, which premises a formal and unchanging relationship between object and viewer, and maintains this. It is not an outward form wrapped around the object that matters to us, but form in the sense of inbuilt capacity and potential vehicle of significance. Form can be filled-in with significance, but can also be deprived of it again, depending on the use that's made of it, through the values we attach to, or add to it, or which we even deprive it of, - all this dependent on the way in which the users and the form react to, and play on each other. The case we want to put is, that it is this capacity to absorb, carry and convey significance that defines what form can bring about in the users - and conversely - what the users can bring about in the form. What matters is the interaction of form and users, what they convey to each other and bring about in each other, and how they mutually take possession of each other. What we have to aim for, is, to form the material (of the things we make) in such a way that - as well as answering to the function in the narrower sense - it will be suitable for more purposes. And thus, it will be able to play as many roles as possible in the service of the various, individual users, - so that everyone will then be able to react to it for himself, interpreting it in his own way, annexing it to his familiar environment, to which it will then make a contribution.\" p. 56\n\nCompared to other directions of structuralism in architecture, the following clarifications are noted: \"In the new architectural movement there is often a tendency to call everything Structuralist that resembles a woven texture and has a grid. This would be a superficial way of looking at things. By nature Structuralism is concerned with the configuration of conditioned and polyvalent units of form (spatial, communicational, constructional or other units) at all urban scales. Only when the users have taken possession of the structures through contact, interpretation or filling-in the details, do the structures achieve their full status. Any architecture that has a tendency to formalism is thus excluded. Flexible form, which has been much discussed, is also rejected as a neutral enclosing system, since it does not offer the appropriate solution for any spatial programme. In the architecture of Herman Hertzberger Structuralist form can be found from the smallest detail up to the most complicated structure, whether it is in terms of spatial, facade or environmental design.\" p. 56\n\nThe next quotation is a definition of structuralism in different fields. It also discusses the autonomy of the primary structure: \"Many Structuralists would describe a structure roughly in the following terms: it is a complete set of relationships, in which the elements can change, but in such a way that these remain dependent on the whole and retain their meaning. The whole is independent of its relationship to the elements. The relationships between the elements are more important than the elements themselves. The elements are interchangeable, but not the relationships.\" p. 16\n\n\nThe principle Structure and Coincidence remains relevant until now, both for housing schemes and urban planning. For housing schemes the following images were influential: the perspective drawing of the project \"Fort l'Empereur\" in Algiers by Le Corbusier (1934) and the isometric drawing of the housing scheme \"Diagoon\" in Delft by Herman Hertzberger (1971). At city level, important projects were: the Tokyo Bay Plan of Kenzo Tange (1960) and the fascinating images of the model of the Free University of Berlin by Candilis Josic & Woods (1963). Also, worth mentioning are the utopias of Metabolism, Archigram and Yona Friedman. In general, instruments for urban structuring are: traffic lines (e.g. gridiron plans), symmetries, squares, remarkable buildings, rivers, seashore, green areas, hills etc. These methods were also used in previous cities.\n\nThe principle Aesthetics of Number proved to be less useful for structuring an entire city. However, exemplary articulated configurations did arise, both in architecture and housing schemes. The first influential images for this direction Aldo van Eyck provided with aerial photos of his orphanage in Amsterdam (1960). Later he built another inspiring configuration for the Space Centre Estec in Noordwijk (1989). These two compositions can be counted among the most beautiful \"icons\" of structuralism.\n\n\nThe term \"aesthetics of number\" is introduced by Aldo van Eyck in the architectural magazine \"Forum\" 7/1959. In his article van Eyck showed two works of art: a structuralist painting by the contemporary artist Richard Paul Lohse and a Kuba textile (Bakuba tissue) by an African artist of the \"primitive\" culture. The combination of these two cultures has a symbolic meaning in the structuralist movement.\n\nIn the 1960s the structuralists criticised the narrowness of the functional principle \"Form Follows Function\". In historic cities they found solutions for a new form principle: an interpretable, adaptable and expandable architecture, see below \"Historic cities - reciprocity of form\". In the magazine \"Forum\" they developed ideas about \"polyvalent form and individual interpretations\", \"reciprocity of form\", \"structure and infill\" and \"participation\". In our time the notions \"open structures\" and \"creation of architectural ensembles\" are also used in discussions.\n\nExamples of urban planning and urban structuring. About the relation between historic and contemporary architecture Le Corbusier wrote: \"I was labelled a revolutionary, whereas my greatest teacher was the Past. My so-called revolutionary ideas are straight out of the history of architecture itself.\" Quotation in No.2. \n\nIn \"Forum\" 2/1962 Jacob Bakema made a study on the principle \"reciprocity of form\" and \"participation\", especially on the Diocletian's Palace in Split. In \"Forum\" 3/1962 Herman Hertzberger did research on the Roman amphitheatres in Arles and Lucca. Later, in 1966 the idea of the amphitheatre in Arles was taken over by Aldo Rossi in his book \"The Architecture of the City\". In 1976 Reyner Banham presented the Ponte Vecchio in Florence as one of the historic prototypes in his book \"Megastructure\".\n\nNew cities in the twentieth century. The term \"Urban Structuring\" is introduced by Alison and Peter Smithson, the term \"Articulations\" (of the built volume) by Herman Hertzberger. Both terms are used as a title of an architectural book.\n\nDe Drie Hoven residential building for elderly people in Amsterdam-Slotervaart by Herman Hertzberger, 1974. In the original state, the primary megastructure was light grey (prefabricated concrete) and the facade elements dark grey and matt (wood construction). Today, the original proportions and colors of the facade elements are changed by the intervention of an unknown architect. Herewith the fine architectural quality of the original building complex has disappeared.\n\nKasbah housing estate in Hengelo by Piet Blom, 1973\n\n"}

Usually, it is distinguished from mass communication research, which tends to approach the topic from an social sciences perspective. Defining the field is problematic; some institutions and syllabuses do not distinguish it from media studies or classify it as a subfield of popular culture studies.\n\nOne form of television studies is roughly equivalent to the longer-standing discipline of film studies in that it is often concerned with textual analysis yet other approaches center more on the social functions of television. For example, analyses of quality television, such as \"Cathy Come Home\" and \"Twin Peaks\", have attracted the interests of researchers for their cinematic qualities. However, television studies can also incorporate the study of television viewing and how audiences make meaning from texts, which is commonly known as audience theory or reception theory.\n\nCharlotte Brunsdon argues that television studies is an \"aspirationally disciplinary name given to the academic study of television.\" Since it is a relatively new discipline, Brunsdon notes that \"...many of the key television scholars are employed in departments of sociology, politics, communication arts, speech, theatre, media and film studies.\" She argues that television studies developed during the 1970s and 1980s \"...from three major bodies of commentary on television: journalism, literary/dramatic criticism and the social sciences.\" Critical methods for television have been \"...extrapolated from traditional literary and dramatic criticism.\" Horace Newcomb argues that television studies scholars often need to justify their academic focus: \"[T]he mere suggestion that television needs analysis itself requires supportive argument.\" \n\nAs a result, television studies is marked by a great deal of \"disciplinary hybridity.\" Perhaps because television scholars are approaching the subject from so many different disciplinary and theoretical perspectives, there are many debates about how television should be understood and conceptualized from a political and methodological point of view. Another impact of the disciplinary hybridity is the diversity in the types of studies carried out. Early television studies included histories of television, biographies of television producers, archival research by historians, and sociological studies of the role the television set played in 1950s homes.\n\nIn television studies, television and other mass media forms are \"...conceptualised within frameworks\" such as \"...ownership; national and international regulation of media production and distribution; professional ideologies; public opinion; [and] media audiences.\" As the field of television studies was being developed, it was influenced by the medium's longstanding issue of invoking \"distrust, fear and contempt\", as a purported cause of social ills. As well, television scholars had to prove that television was different from other \"mass media\", often by pointing to how television differed from radio and cinema.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, television studies developed three strands of commentary: \n\nThe social science stream examined the social function and effects of television and analyzed the role that television plays in the social order and the public sphere. Some television scholars applied Marxist frameworks or the \"critical sociology of the Frankfurt School\". Since the 1970s, feminist television scholars have focused \"... on programmes for women and those which have key female protagonists\", such as Julie D'Acci's study of the police drama \"Cagney and Lacey\" and the \"...now substantial literature on soap opera.\" Television studies in the 1990s includes \"work on the definition and interpretation of the television text and the new media ethnographies of viewing\" and histories of \"production studies\" - how television shows are developed, financed, and produced.\n\nWhile some predicted the end of television (or at least of the broadcast TV), some scholars actually defend that television \"has never been so healthy and triumphant as nowadays\".\n\nScholars who principally work in television studies include:\n\n\n\n\nThe following journals are either devoted to television studies or, at the least, frequently include TV-studies essays.\n\n"}

It examines 'prudent' (sustainable) and 'profligate' (unsustainable) use of natural resources, and their effects. It describes the ecological history of India, from the first humans, through the ages of hunter-gatherers, farmers, empires and the British Raj.\n\nThe book is split into three parts, as follows:\n\nPart 1 introduces the concept of \"Modes of resource use\". According to Sonja Brodt of the University of Hawaii, the authors based this classification on the \"Marxist 'mode of production' framework, which they intend to complement ...[as it lacks]... reflection on ecological parameters, and ...[so]... is not adequately materialistic ... [This book is therefore] written from a strongly materialistic perspective. Everything from economy to ideology is seen to derive from resource use modes.\" Accordingly, there are four modes of resource use - gathering / shifting cultivation, nomadic pastoralism, settled cultivation and industrial society (whether socialist or capitalist), even though more than one mode of resource use may exist in one society at a time. The modes are distinguished by technology, economy, social organisation. ideology and ecological impact. There is conflict between modes, and also within a mode.\n\nThis section also explains the difference between prudent or sustainable use of resources and unsustainable or profligate resource exploitation. Sustainable use involves restrictions on the use of (1) ecologically important species, (2) ecologically sensitive areas, (3) certain life stages (e.g. juveniles) etc. Such strategies may be based on either trial and error - as in early humans and modern tribal societies - or observation and study - as in most modern societies. In either case, sustainable use has little negative impact on the environment, and societies can survive for long periods of time without significant changes. Unsustainable use, whether scientific or unscientific, leads to rapid exhaustion of resources and damage to both the society and its environment.\n\nPart 2 discusses ecological events in the history of India. It argues that the replacement of early hunter-gatherer societies with extensive agricultural ones lead to an environmental crisis during the fourth century CE. Gradually, a village-level conservation system developed. The growing environmental awareness is visible in Buddhist and Jain teachings and literature. Some of these teachings - non-violence, vegetarianism and a practice of mixed agriculture with domestication of animals - particularly cattle - are still seen in India.\n\nPart 3 examines ecologically important events during, and just after, British rule. Colonial forestry practices, such as those favoured by Baden-Powell, led to the destruction of village - level conservation systems. At the same time, little was done on Dietrich Brandis's recommendations to introduce a centralised conservation strategy (as Germany had). The book argues that this is a major reason for India's ecological problems. Finally, a study of industrial and state forestry is made, concluding that they are far inferior to village or social forestry when it comes to conservation.\n\nSonja Brodt feels that \"...[the authors avoid]... the usual, overused stories of conflict ... They also avoid some of the black-and-white cliches so common in writings about colonial resource exploitation in the third world. For example, although British forestry policies are pinpointed as one major cause of forest depletion and conflicts, the authors ...[provide written evidence]... that some of the administrators openly opposed the prevailing policies. They also decline to exonerate all Indian rulers ... The result is an analysis that for the most part is refreshingly frank and balanced in its assessments.\"\n\nThe concluding chapter says that it is too early to say whether a new, more sustainable, mode of resource use will develop as a result of the present environmental crisis. This is because \"given the complexity of ecological communities, precise prescriptions for the prudent use of living resources are difficult\". Sonja Brodt agrees that \"it is ultimately contingent upon the reader to delve deeply into the historical analysis for any lessons it might hold\".\n\nThe original 1992 release was followed by an Oxford India Paperback version in 1993. A revised edition was published in 2013, as part of the 'Oxford India Perennials' series.\n\nE. P. Thompson noted that the book stuck to the pessimistic tone of most environmental texts, and asked why this should be so for a book that looks at a land of such natural and cultural diversity.\n"}

This list is published by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, the members of which are elected by State Parties meeting in a General Assembly.\nThrough a compendium of the different oral and intangible treasures of humankind worldwide, the programme aims to draw attention to the importance of safeguarding intangible heritage, which UNESCO has identified as an essential component and as a repository of cultural diversity and of creative expression.\n\nThe list was established in 2008 when the 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage took effect.\n\nIn 2013 four elements were inscribed on the List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding, which helps States Parties mobilize international cooperation and assistance to ensure the transmission of this heritage with the participation of the concerned communities. The Urgent Safeguarding List now numbers 35 elements.\nThe Committee also inscribed 25 elements on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, which serves to raise awareness of intangible heritage and provide recognition to communities’ traditions and know-how that reflect their cultural diversity. The List does not attribute or recognize any standard of excellence or exclusivity. The list totaled 429 elements .\n\nElements inscribed in the lists are deemed as significant bastions of humanity's intangible heritage, the highest honour for intangible heritage in the world stage.\n\nThe Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity contains intangible cultural heritage elements that \"help demonstrate the diversity of [cultural] heritage and raise awareness about its importance\".\n\nThe List of Intangible Cultural Heritage in Need of Urgent Safeguarding contains intangible cultural heritage elements \"that concerned communities and States Parties consider require urgent measures to keep them alive\".\n\nThe Register for Good Safeguarding Practices allows States Parties, communities and other stakeholders to \"share successful safeguarding experiences and examples of how they surmounted challenges faced in the transmission of their living heritage, its practice and knowledge to the future generation.\"\n\nStates that ratified the Convention, by region:\n\nTotal of inscriptions to date: 337, of which 18 are multinational\n\nThe Lists of Intangible Cultural Heritage were established in 2008, when the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage took effect. Prior to this, a project known as the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity has already been active in recognizing the value of intangibles such as tradition, custom and cultural spaces and the local actors who sustain these forms of cultural expressions through a Proclamation. Identification of the Masterpieces also entails the commitment of states to promote and safeguard these treasures, while UNESCO finances plans for their conservation. Started in 2001 and held biennially until 2005, a total of three Proclamations occurred, encompassing 90 forms of intangible heritage around the world.\n\nThe 90 previously proclaimed Masterpieces have been incorporated into the \"Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity\" as its first entries, to be known as \"elements\". Subsequent elements will be added following the assessment of nominations submitted by national governments acceding to the UNESCO Convention, termed as member states, who are each allowed to submit a single candidature file, in addition to multi-national candidatures. A panel of experts in intangible heritage and an appointed body, known as the Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage, then examine each of the nominations before officially inscribing the candidates as elements on the List.\n\n\nA. Names and spellings used for the elements were based on the official List as published.\nB. A total of three Proclamations of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity were made in 2001, 2003 and 2005. The proclamation was superseded in 2008 when the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity was established.\nC. The 90 elements that were previously proclaimed as Masterpieces have been inscribed onto the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity as per the Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage.\nD.
