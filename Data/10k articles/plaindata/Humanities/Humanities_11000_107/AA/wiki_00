The 3D figurine is usually printed in full color using gypsum-based binder jetting techniques, giving the figurine a sandstone-like texture and look. While the printing process is fairly standardized, the capture of a subject as a 3D model can be accomplished in many ways. Most systems use digital camera or cameras to take 2D pictures of the subject, under normal lighting, under projected light patterns, or a combination of these. A piece of software then reconstructs a 3D model of the subject from these pictures. \n\nInexpensive systems use a single camera which is moved around the subject in 360° at various heights, over minutes, while the subject stays immobile. More elaborate systems have a vertical bar of cameras rotate around the subject, usually achieving a full scan in 10 seconds. Most expensive systems have an enclosed 3D photo booth with 50 to 100 cameras statically embedded in walls and the ceiling, firing all at once, eliminating differences in image capture caused by movements of the subject. \n"}

For example, Greek letter names are acrophonic: the names of the letters α, β, γ, δ, are spelled with the respective letters: (\"alpha\"), (\"beta\"), (\"gamma\"), (\"delta\").\n\nThe paradigm for acrophonic alphabets is the Proto-Sinaitic script and the succeeding Phoenician alphabet, in which the letter A, representing the sound , is thought to have derived from an Egyptian hieroglyph representing an ox, and is called \"ox\", \"ʾalp\", which starts with the glottal stop sound the letter represents. The Latin alphabet is descended from the Phoenician, and the stylized head of an ox can still be seen if the letter A is turned upside-down: ∀. The second letter of the Phoenician alphabet is \"bet\" (which means \"house\" and looks a bit like a shelter) representing the sound , and from \"ālep-bēt\" we have the word \"alphabet\"another case where the beginning of a thing gives the name to the whole, which was in fact common practice in the ancient Near East.\n\nThe Glagolitic and early Cyrillic alphabets, although not consisting of ideograms, also have letters named acrophonically. The letters representing /a, b, v, g, d, e/ are named \"Az\", \"Buky\", \"Vedi\", \"Glagol\", \"Dobro\", \"Est\". Naming the letters in order, one recites a poem, a mnemonic which helps students and scholars learn the alphabet: \"Az buky vedi, glagol’ dobro est’\" means \"I know letters, [the] word is good\" in Old Church Slavonic.\n\nIn Irish and Ogham, letters were formerly named after trees, for example A was \"ailm\" (white fir), B was \"beith\" (birch) and C was \"coll\" (hazel). The rune alphabets used by the Germanic peoples were also named acrophonically; for example, the first three letters, which represented the sounds /f, u, þ/, were named \"fé, ur, þurs\" in Norse (wealth, slag/rain, giant) and \"feoh, ur, þorn\" in Old English (wealth, ox, thorn). Both sets of names probably stemmed from Proto-Germanic \"*fehu, *uruz, *thurisaz\".\n\nThe Thai alphabet is learned acrophonically, each letter being represented pictorially in school-books (chicken, egg, ox, snake, bell, etc.).\n\nRudyard Kipling gives a fictional description of the process in one of his \"Just So Stories\", \"How the Alphabet was Made.\"\n\nModern radiotelephony and aviation uses spelling alphabets (the best-known of which is the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, which begins with \"Alfa\", \"Bravo\", \"Charlie\", \"Delta\"...) in which the letters of the English alphabet are arbitrarily assigned words and names in an acrophonic manner to avoid misunderstanding.\n\nMost notes of the solfege scalenamely \"re\", \"mi\", \"fa\", \"sol\", and \"la\"derive their names from the first syllable of the lines of \"Ut queant laxis\", a Latin hymn.\n"}

Both writs were conceived to solve the extensive Philippine extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances since 1999.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, Philippine Chief Justice Reynato S. Puno and Justice Adolfo Azcuna officially declared the legal conception of the Philippine Writ of Amparo (\"Recurso de Amparo\"), at the historic Manila Hotel National Summit on Extrajudicial Killings and Enforced Disappearances.\n\nOn August 25, 2007, Reynato Puno declared the legal conception of amparo's twin, the supplemental Philippine Habeas Data. Puno by judicial fiat proclaimed the legal birth of these twin peremptory writs on October, 2007, as his legacy to the Filipino nation. Puno admitted the inefficacy of Habeas Corpus, under Rule 102, Rules of Court, since government officers repeatedly failed to produce the body upon mere submission of the defense of alibi.\n\nBy invoking the truth, Habeas Data will not only compel military and government agents to release information about the desaparecidos but require access to military and police files. Reynato Puno's \"writ of amparo\"—Spanish for 'protection'—will bar military officers in judicial proceedings to issue denial answers regarding petitions on disappearances or extrajudicial executions, which were legally permitted in Habeas corpus proceedings.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Philippines announced that the draft guidelines (Committee on Revision of Rules) for the writ of amparo were approved on September 23, to be deliberated by the En Banc Court on September 25.\n\nChief Justice Reynato Puno noted that the model for Amparo was borrowed from Mexico: the right of Amparo is a Mexican legal procedure to protect human rights. Of Mexican origin, thus, “Amparo” literally means “protection” in Spanish. de Tocqueville’s \"Democracy in America\" had been available in Mexico, in 1837 and its description of judicial review practice in the U.S. appealed to many Mexican jurists. Mexican justice Manuel Crescencio Rejón, drafted a constitutional provision for his native state, Yucatan, which empowered jurists to protect all persons in the enjoyment of their constitutional and legal rights. This was incorporated into the 1847 national constitution. The great right proliferated in the Western Hemisphere, slowly evolving into various fora. Amparo became, in the words of a Mexican Federal Supreme Court Justice, Mexico’s “task of conveying to the world’s legal heritage that institution which, as a shield of human dignity, her own painful history conceived.”\n\nAmparo's evolution and metamorphosis had been witnessed, for several purposes: \"(1) amparo libertad for the protection of personal freedom, equivalent to the habeas corpus right; (2) amparo contra leyes for the judicial review of the constitutionality of statutes; (3) amparo casación for the judicial review of the constitutionality and legality of a judicial decisión; (4) amparo administrativo for the judicial review of administrative actions; and (5) amparo agrario for the protection of peasants’ rights derived from the agrarian reform process.\" \n\nLatin American countries, except Cuba, used the great right to protect against human rights abuses especially committed in countries under military juntas, adopting an all-encompassing amparo, even to protect socio-economic rights. But other countries like Colombia, Chile, Germany and Spain, opted to limit amparo shield only to some constitutional guarantees or fundamental rights. In the Philippines, while the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines failed to expressly provide for amparo, several amparo protections are already guaranteed, thus: by paragraph 2, Article VIII, Section 1, the \"\"Grave Abuse Clause\" - which grants a similar general protection to human rights extended by the amparo contra leyes, amparo casacion, and amparo administrativo. Amparo libertad is similar to habeas corpus in the 1987 Constitution. The Clause is borrowed from the U.S. common law tradition of judicial review (1803 case of Marbury v. Madison).\n\nJustice Adolfo Azcuna, a member of two Constitutional Commissions of 1971, and 1986 previously made a study on the Right amparo as published in the Ateneo Law Journal (see Adolfo S. Azcuna, The Right of Amparo: A Remedy to Enforce Fundamental Rights, 37 ATENEO L.J. 15 (1993).).\n\nThe \"recurso de amparo\"\" is an exhaustive remedy which originated from Latin America's Mexican, Chile and Argentina legal systems, \"inter alia\". Mexico's amparo is found in Articles 103 and 107 of the Mexican Constitution -- the judicial review of governmental action, to empower state courts to protect individuals against state abuses. Amparo was sub-divided into 5 legal departments:\n\nAmparo was also legally enshrined in Latin America legal systems. It is now an extraordinary legal remedy in Bolivia, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay Peru, Brazil and Argentina. Amparo in Argentina is a limited, summary, emergency procedure, and merely supplementary, requiring previous exhaustion of administrative remedies before rendition of judgment of mandamus or injunction. The decision bars monetary awards and penal provisions except contempt or declaration of unconstitutionality.\n\nHistorically, Philippine Habeas Corpus (from 1901 until the present) failed to provide an efficacious legal remedy to victims of extra-judicial killings and \"desaparecidos\". The \"amparo de libertad\" transcends the protection of \"habeas corpus\". Once a lawsuit is filed under Habeas Corpus, Rule 102, Rules of Court, the defendants, government officers would merely submit the usual defense of alibi or non-custody of the body sought to be produced.\n\nThe writ of \"habeas corpus\" is an \"extraordinary\", \"common law\", or \"prerogative writ\", which were historically issued by English courts in the name of the monarch to control inferior courts and public authorities within the kingdom. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are \"quo warranto\", \"prohibito\", \"mandamus\", \"procedendo\", and \"certiorari\".\nThe due process for such petitions is not simply civil or criminal, because they incorporate the presumption of non-authority, so that the official who is the respondent has the burden to prove his authority to do or not do something, failing which the court has no discretion but to decide for the petitioner, who may be any person, not just an interested party.\n\nOn July 16, 2007, Justices, activists, militant leaders, police officials, politicians and prelates attended the Supreme Court of the Philippines's 2-day summit at the Manila Hotel, Metro Manila to solve extrajudicial killings. Chief Justice Reynato Puno stated that the \"\"National Consultative Summit on Extrajudicial Killings and Forced Disappearances: Searching for Solutions\" would help stop the murders. Based on CBCP - Bishop Deogracias Yniguez-church's count, the number of victims of extrajudicial killings was record at 778, while survivors of \"political assassinations\" was 370; 203 \"massacre\" victims; 186 desaparecido; 502 tortured, and those illegally arrested.\n\nPuno requested for truce and talks with insurgents: \"Let us rather engage in the conspiracy of hope…and hope for peace\".\" Puno forwarded the summit's recommendation to President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, the Senate of the Philippines and House of Representatives.\n\n“\"Extralegal killings\"” (UN instruments term) are those committed without due process of law, which include summary and arbitrary executions, “\"salvagings\"”, threats to take the life of journalists, \"inter alia\". “\"Enforced disappearances\"” (defined by Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances), include: arrest, detention or abduction by a government official or organized groups under the government; the refusal of the State to disclose the fate or whereabouts of missing persons, \"inter alia\".\n\nOn August 17, 2007 Puno said that the writ of amparo, would bar the military plea of denial (at a speech at the Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption's 9th anniversary, Camp Crame). Under the writ, plaintiffs or victims will have the right of access to information on their lawsuits—a constitutional right called the \"\"habeas data\" derived from constitutions of Latin America. The final draft of these twin writs (retroactive) will be promulgated on October. Puno tersely summed the writs \"In other words, if you have this right, it would be very, very difficult for State agents, State authorities to be able to escape from their culpability.\"\n\nPuno stated that with the writ of Habeas corpus, the writs of Habeas Data and writ of amparo will further assist \"those looking for missing loved ones\"\".\nOn August 30, 2007, Puno (speech at Silliman University in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental) promised to institute the \"writ of habeas data\" (“\"you should have the idea\"” or “\"you should have the data\"”). Puno explained that amparo bars alibi, while Habeas Data \"\"can find out what information is held by the officer, rectify or even the destroy erroneous data gathered\". Brazil used the writ, followed by Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Argentina and Ecuador.\n\nThe Philippine 1987 Constitution was derived from the 1973 Ferdinand Marcos Constitution, its 1981 amendment, from the 1935 constitution, and from the United States Constitution. The United States Constitution was adopted in its original form on September 17, 1787, by the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and later ratified by conventions in each state in the name of \"the People\".\" The U.S. Constitution is the oldest written national constitution except possibly for San Marino 's Statutes of 1600, whose status as a true constitution is disputed by scholars. The Writ of Amparo is a remedy to enforce fundamental rights. “\"among the different procedures that have been established for the protection of human rights, the primary ones that provide direct and immediate protection are habeas corpus and amparo. The difference between these two writs is that habeas corpus is designed to enforce the right to freedom of the person, whereas amparo is designed to protect those other fundamental human rights enshrined in the Constitution but not covered by the writ of habeas corpus\".”\nThe literal translation from Latin of Habeas Data is “\"you should have the data\"”. Habeas Data is a constitutional right to protect, per lawsuit filed in court, to protect the image, privacy, honour, information self-determination and freedom of information of a person. Habeas Data can used to discover what information is held about his or her person (via rectification or destruction of the personal data held. Habeas Data originated, \"inter alia\", from the Council of Europe’s 108th Convention on Data Protection of 1981 (aimed at protecting the privacy of the individual regarding the automated processing of personal data; with right to access their personal data held in an automated database.\n\nOn September 25, 2007, Chief Justice Reynato Puno officially announced the approval or promulgation of the Writ of Amparo: \"Today, the Supreme Court promulgated the rule that will place the constitutional right to life, liberty and security above violation and threats of violation. This rule will provide the victims of extralegal killings and enforced disappearances the protection they need and the promise of vindication for their rights. This rule empowers our courts to issue reliefs that may be granted through judicial orders of protection, production, inspection and other relief to safeguard one's life and liberty The writ of amparo shall hold public authorities, those who took their oath to defend the constitution and enforce our laws, to a high standard of official conduct and hold them accountable to our people. The sovereign Filipino people should be assured that if their right to life and liberty is threatened or violated, they will find vindication in our courts of justice.\"[36]\n\nOn January 22, 2008, the Supreme En Banc approved the rules for the writ of Habeas Data (\"to protect a person’s right to privacy and allow a person to control any information concerning them\"), effective on February 2, the Philippines’ Constitution Day. Reynato Puno traced the history of Habeas Data \"to the Council of Europe’s 108th Convention on Data Protection of 1981; Brazil was the first Latin American country to adopt the Writ of Habeas Data in 1988 and was strengthened by its National Congress in 1997; in 1991, Colombia incorporated Habeas Data in its Constitution; Paraguay followed in 1992, Peru in 1993, Argentina in 1994, and Ecuador in 1996.\" In Argentina, Habeas Data allowed \"access to police and military records otherwise closed to them.\"\n\nThe Resolution and the Rule on the Writ of Amparo gave legal birth to Puno's brainchild. No filing or legal fee is required for Amparo which takes effect on October 24 in time for the 62nd anniversary of the United Nations. Puno also stated that the court will soon issue rules on the writ of Habeas Data and the implementing guidelines for Habeas Corpus. The petition for the writ of amparo may be filed \"on any day and at any time\" with the Regional Trial Court, or with the Sandiganbayan, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. The interim reliefs under amparo are: temporary protection order (TPO), inspection order (IO), production order (PO), and witness protection order (WPO, RA 6981). and as of now..\n\n\nThe Supreme Court of the Philippines, on October 7, 2008, rendered its first amparo decision, affirming the December 26, 2007 Philippine Court of Appeals judgment in favor of Raymond and Reynaldo Manalo brothers. Reynato Puno's 49-page unanimous ponencia granted amparo relief to the Manalo brothers who were abducted by the Citizens Armed Forces Geographical Unit (CAFGU) in San Ildefonso, Bulacan in February 2006. They escaped on August 13, 2007, after 18 months of detention and torture.\n\nOn September 28, 2007, the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) described the new writs of \"amparo\" and \"habeas data \" as insufficient to resolve the problems of extra-legal killings and enforced disappearances in the Philippines. It argued that there must be a cooperative action on all parts of the government and civil society:\n\nThe AHRC objected that the writs fail to protect non-witnesses, even if they too face threats or risk to their lives.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13245601", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13245601", "title": "Competition law theory", "text": "Competition law theory\n\nCompetition law theory covers the strands of thought relating to competition law or antitrust policy.\n\nThe classical perspective on competition was that certain agreements and business practice could be an unreasonable restraint on the individual liberty of tradespeople to carry on their livelihoods. Restraints were judged as permissible or not by courts as new cases appeared and in the light of changing business circumstances. Hence the courts found specific categories of agreement, specific clauses, to fall foul of their doctrine on economic fairness, and they did not contrive an overarching conception of market power. Earlier theorists like Adam Smith rejected any monopoly power on this basis.\n\n\"A monopoly granted either to an individual or to a trading company has the same effect as a secret in trade or manufactures. The monopolists, by keeping the market constantly under-stocked, by never fully supplying the effectual demand, sell their commodities much above the natural price, and raise their emoluments, whether they consist in wages or profit, greatly above their natural rate.\"\n\nIn \"The Wealth of Nations\" (1776) Adam Smith also pointed out the cartel problem, but did not advocate legal measures to combat them.\n\n\"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary.\"\n\nSmith also rejected the very existence of, not just dominant and abusive corporations, but corporations at all.\n\nBy the latter half of the nineteenth century it had become clear that large firms had become a fact of the market economy. John Stuart Mill's approach was laid down in his treatise \"On Liberty\" (1859).\n\n\"Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any description of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society... both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, qua restraint, is an evil...\"\n\nThe use of the word \"society\" to mean the state, and the false claim that because a \"social act\" effects the \"interest\" of other persons it comes under the \"jurisdiction\" of the state, even if the act is entirely voluntary (i.e. an act of Free Will, agency, for both parties in the exchange). Liberty in commercial matters (in the voluntary buying and selling of goods and services) is not some different \"principle\" to liberty generally - it is clearly the same principle.\n\nAfter Mill, there was a shift in economic theory, which emphasised a more precise and theoretical model of competition. A simple neo-classical model of free markets holds that production and distribution of goods and services in competitive free markets maximizes social welfare. This model assumes that new firms can freely enter markets and compete with existing firms, or to use legal language, there are no barriers to entry. By this term economists mean something very specific, that competitive free markets deliver allocative, productive and dynamic efficiency. Allocative efficiency is also known as Pareto efficiency after the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto and means that resources in an economy over the long run will go precisely to those who are willing and able to pay for them. Because rational producers will keep producing and selling, and buyers will keep buying up to the last marginal unit of possible output - or alternatively rational producers will be reduce their output to the margin at which buyers will buy the same amount as produced - there is no waste, the greatest number wants of the greatest number of people become satisfied and utility is perfected because resources can no longer be reallocated to make anyone better off without making someone else worse off; society has achieved allocative efficiency. Productive efficiency simply means that society is making as much as it can. Free markets are meant to reward those who work hard, and therefore those who will put society's resources towards the frontier of its possible production. Dynamic efficiency refers to the idea that business which constantly competes must research, create and innovate to keep its share of consumers. This traces to Austrian-American political scientist Joseph Schumpeter's notion that a \"perennial gale of creative destruction\" is ever sweeping through capitalist economies, driving enterprise at the market's mercy.\n\nContrasting with the allocatively, productively and dynamically efficient market model are monopolies, oligopolies, and cartels. When only one or a few firms exist in the market, and there is no credible threat of the entry of competing firms, prices raise above the competitive level, to either a monopolistic or oligopolistic equilibrium price. Production is also decreased, further decreasing social welfare by creating a deadweight loss. Sources of this market power are said to include the existence of externalities, barriers to entry of the market, and the free rider problem. Markets may fail to be efficient for a variety of reasons, so the exception of competition law's intervention to the rule of \"laissez faire\" is justified. Orthodox economists fully acknowledge that perfect competition is seldom observed in the real world, and so aim for what is called \"workable\" or \"effective competition\". This follows the theory that if one cannot achieve the ideal, then go for the second best option by using the law to tame market operation where it can.\n\nA group of economists and lawyers, who are largely associated with the University of Chicago, advocate an approach to competition law guided by the proposition that some actions that were originally considered to be anticompetitive could actually promote competition. The US Supreme Court has used the Chicago School approach in several recent cases. One view of the Chicago School approach to antitrust is found in United States Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard Posner's books\"Antitrust law\" and \"Economic Analysis of Law\" Posner once worked in the Department of Justice's antitrust division, has long been a professor at the University of Chicago Law School, and is likely the most widely cited antitrust scholar and jurist in the United States.\n\nRobert Bork was highly critical of court decisions on United States antitrust law in a series of law review articles and his book \"The Antitrust Paradox\". Bork argued that both the original intention of antitrust laws and economic efficiency was pursuit \"only\" of consumer welfare, the protection of competition rather than competitors. Furthermore, only a few acts should be prohibited, namely cartels that fix prices and divide markets, mergers that create monopolies, and dominant firms pricing predatorily, while allowing such practices as vertical agreements and price discrimination on the grounds that it did not harm consumers. Running through the different critiques of US antitrust policy is the common theme that government interference in the operation of free markets does more harm than good. \"The only cure for bad theory\", writes Bork, \"is better theory\". The late Harvard Law School Professor Phillip Areeda, who favours more aggressive antitrust policy, in at least one Supreme Court case challenged Robert Bork's preference for non intervention.\n\nSome economic libertarians have criticised competition law in its entirety,\nchallenging the legitimacy of action against price fixing and cartels.\n\nSee Dominic Armentaro \"Antitrust: The Case for Repeal\" (Ludwig Von Mises Institute 1986) and \"The Case Against Antitrust\" by Robert A. Levy (Cato Institute 2004). The case being that \"competition law\" (or \"Antitrust\") is based upon a false view of economics - that it harms rather than benefits consumers in the long term. And that \"competition law\" (or \"Antitrust\") is based upon principles of law and philosophy that are both false and confused.\n\nAnti-cartel enforcement is a key focus of competition law enforcement policy. In the United States the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act 2004 raised the maximum imprisonment term for price fixing from three to ten years, and the maximum fine from $10 million to $100 million. In 2007 British Airways and Korean Air pleaded guilty to fixing cargo and passenger flight prices.\n\nThese actions complement the private enforcement which has always been an important feature of United States antitrust law. The United States Supreme Court summarised why Congress allows punitive damages in \"Hawaii v. Standard Oil\".\n\n\"Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation.\"\n\nIn the EU, the Modernisation Regulation 1/2003 means that the European Commission is no longer the only body capable of public enforcement of European Community competition law. This was done in order to facilitate quicker resolution of competition-related inquiries. In 2005 the Commission issued a Green Paper on \"Damages actions for the breach of the EC antitrust rules\", which suggested ways of making private damages claims against cartels easier.\n\n\n\n"}

Since its original formation in 1943 as a language-training program for the U.S. military, the department has become the sole independent degree-granting academic unit staffed with its own faculty dedicated to Central Eurasia in the country. Due to the department and the presence of several additional centers - the Inner Asian & Uralic National Resource Center, the Denis Sinor Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies, and the Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region - Indiana University currently hosts the premier program of Central Asian studies in the United States.\n\nCEUS is home to many notable scholars of Central Eurasian studies, past and present, including Christopher Beckwith, Yuri Bregel, Jamsheed Choksy, Devin Deweese, William Fierman, Gyorgy Kara, Nazif Shahrani, Denis Sinor, and Elliot Sperling. The department teaches many less commonly taught languages, including Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Kurdish, Pashto, Tajik, Turkmen, Uyghur, and Uzbek.\n\nIn 1942, after the entry of the United States into World War II, an Army Specialized Training Program was created to provide training in several Eurasian languages, including Russian, Turkish, Finnish, and Hungarian. As such, the Department was founded in 1943 as an \"Army Specialized Training Program for Central Eurasian languages\". It was formally organized as the Program in Uralic and Altaic Studies in 1956. In 1965 it became the Department of Uralic and Altaic Studies. Since 1993 it has been known under its current name.\n\nProfessor Denis Sinor arrived from Cambridge University in the academic year of 1962-63. On his initiative, in 1965, the Program in Uralic and Altaic Studies was recognized as a graduate department. Professor Sinor was appointed the first Chairman of the Department and he held this position until 1981.\n\nThe Department of Central Eurasian Studies offers a Bachelor of Arts, a Master of Arts and a PhD track of study, including a PhD minor. The department's area studies program emphasizes language proficiency and familiarity with indigenous cultures. The degree program requires students to select a language of specialization local to the region and a specific region of specialization within Central Eurasia.\n\n\nThe following areas, both political and cultural, are considered to fall within the scope of the department.\n\n\n\nIn 1962, Indiana University became home to the Uralic and Altaic Language and Area Center, which in 1981 was renamed the Inner Asian and Uralic National Resource Center (IAUNRC). It is part of the National Resource Center program, and is funded by a Title VI grant from the U.S. Department of Education, through which it receives approximately $230,000 a year. It scope includes the civilizations of Central Asia, Mongolia, and Tibet, together with neighboring areas and peoples that in certain periods formed cultural, political, or ethnolinguistic unities with these regions. It is the only national resource center focusing on Inner Asia.The center awards FLAS fellowships and engages in outreach and educational activities in the local area and throughout the country.\n\nEstablished in 1967 as the Asian Studies Research Institute (ASRI), its name was changed to the Research Institute for Inner Asian Studies (RIFIAS) in 1979, and then renamed the Denis Sinor Institute for Inner Asian Studies (SRIFIAS) in 2007. It is an independent, non-profit institution accountable to the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences of the Bloomington campus of Indiana University. The SRIFIAS has had five directors, all members of the faculty of the Department of Central Eurasian Studies at Indiana University: Denis Sinor (1967–1981), Stephen Halkovic (1982–1985), Yuri Bregel (1986–1997), Devin DeWeese (1997–2007), and Edward Lazzerini (since 2007). The mission of the SRIFIAS is to encourage and support scholarly research in all aspects of Inner Asian Studies. One of the central tasks of the SRIFIAS is to maintain and develop scholarly and technical resources necessary for research in Inner Asian studies.\n\nThe Institute of Hungarian Studies was established in 1991 to disseminate knowledge about Hungarian society and civilization; to support organizations and projects related to Hungarian Studies at Indiana University; and to house the Institute's impressive library of several thousand volumes of Hungarica. During the 2002/2003 academic year, the Institute was closed as a separate operation, while continuing to be administered by CEUS, which offers graduate degrees in Hungarian Studies. The significant collection of materials from the Institute’s Library and Archives was integrated into the Indiana University Herman B Wells Library collections.\n\nIndiana University's Center for Languages of the Central Asian Region (CeLCAR) is one of fifteen current Language Resource Centers funded by the U.S. Department of Education’s Title VI grants. Additional support comes from the College of Arts and Sciences. The goal of CeLCAR is to enhance U.S. national capacity for teaching and learning the languages and cultures of Central Asia and surrounding regions. In 2008 the center was awarded a $100,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to train U.S. government personnel in the history, cultures, and languages of Afghanistan.\n\n"}

Exophora can be deictic, in which special words or grammatical markings are used to make reference to something in the context of the utterance or speaker. For example, pronouns are often exophoric, with words such as \"this\", \"that\", \"here\", \"there\", as in \"that chair over there is John's\" said while indicating the direction of the chair referred to. Given \"Did the gardener water those plants?\", it is quite possible that \"those\" refers back to the preceding text, to some earlier mention of those particular plants in the discussion. But it is also possible that it refers to the environment in which the dialogue is taking place—to the \"context of situation\", as it is called—where the plants in question are present and can be pointed to if necessary. The interpretation would be \"those plants there, in front of us\". This kind of reference is called exophora, since it takes us outside the text altogether. Exophoric reference is not cohesive, since it does not bind the two elements together into a text.\n\nA type of exophora, homophora relates to a generic phrase that obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context; a specific example of homophora can variably be a \"homophor\" or a \"homophoric reference\".\n\nFor example, the meaning of the phrase \"the Queen\" may be determined by the country in which it is spoken. Because there are many Queens throughout the world, the location of the speaker provides the extra information that allows an individual Queen to be identified.\n\nThe precise origin of the term is not fully clear, but it is probably intended to suggest a referring expression that always has the same (Greek \"hómos\") referent (within a given cultural context, of course). \"Homophoric\" seems to have been first used in the influential book by M.A.K. Halliday and R. Hasan, \"Cohesion in English\" (Longman, 1976, pp. 71 and 73).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "56027886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56027886", "title": "Family resemblance (anthropology)", "text": "Family resemblance (anthropology)\n\nFamily resemblance refers to physical similarities shared between close relatives, especially between parents and children and between siblings. In psychology, the similarities of personality are also observed.\n\nHeritability, defined as a measure of family resemblance, causes traits to be genetically passed from parents to offspring (heredity), allowing evolutionarily advantageous traits to persist through generations. Despite sharing parents, siblings do not inherit identical genes, making studies on identical twins (who have identical DNA) especially effective at analyzing the role genetics play in phenotypic similarity. Studies have found that generational resemblance of many phenotypic traits results from the inheritance of multiples genes that collectively influence a trait (additive genetic variance). There is evidence of heritability in personality traits. For example, one study found that approximately half of personality differences in high-school aged fraternal and identical twins were due to genetic variation - and another study suggests that no one personality trait is more heritable than another.\n\nFamily resemblance is also shaped by environmental factors, temperature, light, nutrition, exposure to drugs, the time that different family members spend in shared and non-shared environments, are examples of factors found to influence phenotype. Phenotypes found to be largely environmentally determined in humans include personality, height, and weight. Twin studies have shown that more than half of the variation in a few major aspects of personality are environmentally determined, and that environmental factors even affect traits like immune response and how children handle stress. Additionally, anomalous findings, such as second-degree relatives of alcoholics, showing surprising similarities to them have led some researchers’ attempts in generating better models that account for the environmental impacts on influences like cultural inheritance, family structure and head of household, which have been shown to influence family resemblance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49947626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49947626", "title": "Fat Leonard scandal", "text": "Fat Leonard scandal\n\nThe Fat Leonard scandal is a corruption scandal and ongoing investigation within the United States Navy involving ship support contractor Glenn Defense Marine Asia (GDMA), a subsidiary of the Glenn Marine Group. The \"Washington Post\" called the scandal \"perhaps the worst national-security breach of its kind to hit the Navy since the end of the Cold War.\" At the heart of the scandal was Glenn Defense Marine Asia, a firm run by playboy Leonard Glenn Francis, a Malaysian national of Portuguese and Sri Lankan extraction. Six foot three inches tall, and weighing 350 pounds despite a stomach stapling, he was known as \"Fat Leonard.\" Francis disbursed hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, travel expenses, luxury items, and prostitutes among a large number of U.S. uniformed officers of the United States Seventh Fleet. They in turn gave him classified material about the movements of U.S. ships and submarines, confidential contracting information, and information about active law enforcement investigations into Glenn Defense Marine Asia. Francis then \"exploited the intelligence for illicit profit, brazenly ordering his moles to redirect aircraft carriers to ports he controlled in Southeast Asia so he could more easily bilk the Navy for fuel, tugboats, barges, food, water and sewage removal.\" He also directed them to author \"Bravo Zulu\" memos, commending GDMA for doing supposed work \"well done.\"\n\nThe first activities of the conspiracy were confirmed to have existed in 2006 when Francis recruited numerous Navy personnel to engage in corruption, including directing contracts toward his firm, disfavoring competitors, and inhibiting legitimate fiscal and operational oversight. The initial co-conspirators labelled themselves \"the cool kids\" and \"the wolf pack.\" \n\nU.S. federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against 33 people in connection with the Fat Leonard scandal. Of those, 21 pleaded guilty: Francis himself, four of his top aides, and 16 Navy officials (specifically, ten commissioned officers, two petty officers, one former NCIS special agent, and two civilian Navy contracting officials). Nine others are awaiting trial in U.S. district court in San Diego. Separately, five Navy officers were charged with crimes under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and have been subject to court-martial proceedings. An additional civilian pleaded guilty to a scandal-related crime in Singapore court.\n\nSuffering health problems, Francis was hospitalized and released in March 2018. Rather than returning to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service, he was granted a medical furlough and allowed to stay in San Diego at a private residence owned by one of his physicians, under 24-hour surveillance for which his family paid. At a deposition taken in 2018 in the David A. Morales case, Leonard said he is being treated for kidney cancer.\n\nIn 1989, when he was 21, Leonard had been sentenced to three years in jail in Malaysia for firearms possession.\n\nIn 2006, Dave Schauss, a NCIS investigator, became suspicious of GDMA contracts, but Francis was alerted by an informant, Paul Simpkins, to the scrutiny. Simpkins, a decorated veteran of the U.S. Air Force employed as a civilian contracting officer by the Navy in Singapore, managed to quash any inquiry and had Schauss' position eliminated. \"What else could I have done to expose this racket?,\" Schauss asked. Exposed as a whistleblower, he said officers, \"made my life hell\" after discovering he had attempted to initiate an investigation of GDMA. In 2007, the Navy's Inspector General forwarded a document claiming GDMA was grossly overcharging the Navy for providing port security but NCIS may have failed to follow up the warning. According to a senior Navy officer, \"Everybody knew that [Glenn Defense] had been under investigation.\" \"Everybody also knew that nothing ever happened with those investigations.\" After that, the Manila NCIS office got an anonymous letter and documents, alleging GDMA had overcharged for fees, armed guards and other services during a Subic Bay, Philippines port visit by the Fred Stockham container support ship. \"I hope you share the same concern when reading these documents and take swift action to stamp out this fraud, waste and abuse,\" the letter said. Manila's NCIS agents forwarded the paperwork to the Navy's Singapore contracting office, but it had been infiltrated by GDMA's moles, and they claimed the allegations were false, closing the case. Mike Lang, a contracting officer who worked there from 2006 to 2008, said, \"They'd always side with Glenn Defense and paint us as troublemakers. They'd say, 'Why are you harassing our contractors? You're making my job hard'.\" Two officials from that office, Simpkins and his subordinate, Sharon Gursharan Kaur who was also a civilian Navy contracting officer, as well as a former GDMA employee, were sentenced to six years and 33 months, respectively, the latter doing her time in Singapore. NCIS reportedly opened and closed as many as 27 investigations without taking action against GDMA, demonstrating a staggering level of incompetence while regularly traveling throughout South and Southeast Asia accomplishing nothing of significance.\n\nDocuments obtained by the Washington Post via Freedom of Information Requests (FOIAs) revealed that after al-Qaeda committed the October 2000 suicide attack on the USS \"Cole\" and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the Navy's Economic Crimes unit was reduced from a staff of 140 to only nine persons, most having been reassigned to focus on terrorism. At least 27 separate investigations had been opened, but later closed without action, thanks to the intervention of senior Navy personnel who were in league with Francis. John Hogan, the NCIS executive assistant director for criminal operations, admitted, \"In hindsight, maybe we could have dug a little deeper than we did.\" Ray Mabus, who was appointed Navy Secretary by President Barack Obama in 2009, admitted his branch was vulnerable to contracting fraud and should have performed better oversight: \"I'm not going to defend at all opening and closing 27 cases. Something should have raised a red flag along there somewhere...There were people inside the Navy who were trying to shut this down, who were coming up with reasons not to pursue it.\" In 2010, a civilian Navy attorney drafted restrictive ethics guidelines for the 7th Fleet. Two admirals friendly to Francis were said to be responsible for seeing that it was delayed and diluted over the next 2 1/2 years, before being implemented.\n\nIn 2010, Navy officials became suspicious that some of the bills submitted by GDMA from Thailand were padded. The escalating and somewhat unrestrained costs prompted the Navy to build a logistics team to keep contracts somewhat in check, but it was frustrated because Francis had a spy, Jose Luis Sanchez, feeding its information back to him. (Sanchez has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and awaits sentencing.) Despite the increasing awareness that the Navy was being subjected to massive fraud, GDMA was able to contract to deliver $200 million in services in 2011 alone. After a three-year investigation and having planted false information that their inquiries had been closed, putting Francis off his guard, federal agents lured him to the United States. In September 2013, he was arrested at a San Diego hotel in a sting operation. He pleaded guilty in January 2015 and is awaiting sentencing. Leonard admitted to using his U.S. Navy contacts, including ship captains, to obtain classified information and to defraud the Navy of tens of millions of dollars by steering ships to specific ports in the Pacific and falsifying service charges. In his plea, Francis identified seven Navy officials who accepted bribes. He faces a maximum prison sentence of 25 years and agreed to forfeit $35 million in personal assets, an amount he admits to overcharging the Navy.\n\nSince 2013, 31 people have been criminally charged in connection with the Fat Leonard bribery and corruption scandal. According to investigators, by November 2017, more than 440 people — including 60 admirals — have come under scrutiny under the inquiry. The Navy held a military trial for a still-serving commander, David A. Morales, the first not left to civilian prosecution. He was charged with bribery, conspiracy to commit bribery, false official statements, failure to obey lawful orders, and conduct unbecoming an officer. He was acquitted of the first three charges in a bench trial, found guilty of only failure to obey lawful orders and conduct unbecoming. As of September 2018, 30 people have pleaded guilty; 12 others have been charged (including eight Navy officers who were indicted in March 2017); four admirals were disciplined by the military; two others are known to be under investigation; and more than 150 other unidentified people have been scrutinized.\n\nA March 2017 indictment made reference to \"AG\", a former officer in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), who had been employed for several years as a liaison officer aboard . On May 3, 2018, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation identified \"AG\" as Lieutenant Commander Alex Gillett, reporting that he had resigned from the Navy after being questioned by the Australian Federal Police . A second unidentified Australian of similar rank was also reported to be under investigation. A memo of understanding between the U.S. Navy and the RAN allows for the possible extradition of Australian personnel to the United States for the purposes of prosecution.\n\nAmong the nineteen people who have pleaded guilty to federal crimes, one was Francis himself, two others were his top deputies; and sixteen others were Navy personnel. The highest-ranking was Rear Admiral Robert Gilbeau, who was convicted in June 2016 after pleading guilty to making false statements to investigators about his contacts with Francis, becoming the first Navy admiral in modern American history to be convicted of a felony while on active duty. On May 17, 2017, U.S. District Judge Janis Lynn Sammartino sentenced Gilbeau to 18 months in prison, although he will be allowed to continue collecting his nearly $10,000 monthly pension.\nHe is being held in FCI Englewood, a low security federal prison in Littleton, Colorado, and is scheduled for release on November 1, 2018.\n\nNational University of Singapore, corporate governance expert Mak Yuen Teen, noted that procurement in the defense industry is particularly vulnerable to bribery and corruption. \"It is usually not that transparent,\" with infrequent bidding for large contracts. Blowing the whistle on superior officers might also be discouraged, he indicated. \"Those at the top probably thought they could get away with it as their underlings were unlikely to squeal on them.\"\n\nAccording to its spokesman Captain Amy Derrick, the U.S. Navy canceled all contracts with GDMA as the result of a 2013 audit.\n\nIn the case of former Naval Intelligence chief, Vice Admiral Ted N. Branch, both the Navy and the Department of Justice declined to prosecute after a three-year investigation.\n\nIn February 2018, through Admiral Bill Moran, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, the navy announced the implementation of increased oversight and other measures and policies to deter a repeat of the widespread corruption in the \"Fat Leonard\" case. Glenn Fine, the principal deputy in the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, said the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, the criminal investigative arm of the DOD's OIG, said GDMA, Francis’ contract firm, created a scheme to defraud the Navy of tens of millions of dollars via overbilling for supplying goods and services. The Navy created a Consolidated Disposition Authority, or CDA, tasked with determining whether hundreds of Navy officers should be charged under the UCMJ, or alternatively, to be subjected to administrative actions. Fine said the CDA has already adjudicated 300-plus cases.\n\nExcept for Gursharan Kaur Sharon Rachael's case, which was tried in Singapore, and those of five persons charged in military courts (Captain John F. Steinberger, Commander David A. Morales, Commander Jason W. Starmer, Lt. Peter Vapor, and Chief Warrant Officer Brian T. Ware), all court proceedings as of July 10, 2018, are in U.S. federal court.\n\n"}

It was moved to the park of Saint-Cloud in 1900 when the palais de l'Industrie was demolished.

There are many such systems in place and they are generally named or described based on how the GNSS sensor receives the external information. Some systems transmit additional information about sources of error (such as clock drift, ephemeris, or ionospheric delay), others provide direct measurements of how much the signal was off in the past, while a third group provide additional vehicle information to be integrated in the calculation process.\n\nSatellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS) support wide-area or regional augmentation through the use of additional satellite-broadcast messages. Using measurements from the ground stations, correction messages are created and sent to one or more satellites for broadcast to end users as differential signal. SBAS is sometimes synonymous with WADGPS, wide-area DGPS.\n\nThe GBAS and SBAS that have been implemented or proposed include:\n\nGround-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) provides Differential GPS (DGPS) corrections and integrity verification near an airport, replacing ILSs.\nReference receivers in surveyed positions measure GPS deviations and calculate corrections emitted at 2 Hz through VHF data broadcast (VDB) within .\nOne GBAS supports up to 48 approaches and covers many runway ends with more installation flexibility than an ILS with localizer and glideslope antennas at each end.\nA GBAS can provide multiple approaches to reduce wake turbulence and improve resilience, maintaining availability and operations continuity.\nIn December 2008, the New York Port Authority invested $2.5 million to install a GBAS at New York EWR with Continental (now United) equipping 15 aircraft for $1.1 million while the FAA committed $2.5 million to assess the technology.\nHoneywell’s SLS-4000 GBAS design was approved by the FAA in September 2009 and is still the only one.\nIt offers Cat. 1 instrument landings with a decision height and can be upgraded to a Cat. 2 with real-time monitoring of ionospheric conditions through SBAS, while the more precise Cat. 3 SLS-5000 is waiting for compatible airliners.\nThe first installations were approved in EWR in 2012 and Houston / IAH in 2013.\nThe Port Authority recommends a GBAS for New York JFK and LaGuardia (LGA) to alleviate congestion.\nNewark and Houston GBAS were upgraded to Cat. 2, Seattle-Tacoma, San Francisco SFO, JFK and LGA are expected next.\nAmong the 20 Honeywell GBAS installations worldwide, the other U.S. installations are: Honeywell's test facility in Johnson County, Kansas; the FAA Technical Center at Atlantic City Airport, New Jersey; Boeing's test facility in Grant County, Washington; the B787 plant in Charleston International, South Carolina; and Anoka County–Blaine Airport near Minneapolis.\nAirports equipped in Europe are Bremen, Frankfurt, Málaga and Zurich.\nin Asia-Pacific, airport with installations are Chennai, Kuala Lumpur, Melbourne, Seoul-Gimpo, Shanghai-Pudong and Sydney.\nOther locations are St. Helena in the South Atlantic, Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and Rio de Janeiro–Galeão.\nThere are around 100 Cat. 1 GBAS landing systems (GLS) installations in Russia with Russian-specific technology.\nIn the US, GBAS was previously known as the Local-area augmentation system while a SBAS with a ground references network providing GPS corrections is called WAAS.\nIn June 2016, the FAA ditched Cat. 1 GBAS as the WAAS has similar capabilities.\nIn the US, there were more WAAS LPV approaches reaching than Cat. 1 ILS approaches by March 2018.\nThe FAA support airport installations but does not fund GBAS as of September 2018, as it analyses its cost-benefits.\nAn installed Cat. 1 GBAS costs $3-4 million; and $700,000 more for Cat. 2.\nBy Spring 2018, Boeing delivered 3,500 GLS-capable airliners, with 5,000 on order: GLS Cat. 2/3 is standard on the Boeing 747-8, 787 and 777 while GLS Cat. 1 is optional on the 737NG/MAX and GLS Cat. 2/3 will be offered from 2020.\nAirbus offers GLS Cat. 1 with autoland on the A320, A330, A350 and A380.\nThe FAA’s NextGen promotes GBAS and GLS to increase airport capacity and to lower noise and weather delays.\nBoeing prefers FAA support than funding while the National Air Traffic Controllers Association argues rigid approaches will lower traffic management flexibility, losing throughput and capacity, a viewpoint shared by Delta Air Lines.\nSome ICAO members vetter GBAS Approach Service Types-D (GAST-D) supporting Cat. 2/3 approach and landing.\n\nThere are stricter Safety requirements on GBAS systems relative to SBAS systems since GBAS is intended mainly for the landing phase where real-time accuracy and signal integrity control is critical, especially when weather deteriorates to the extent that there is no visibility (CAT-I/II/III conditions) for which SBAS is not intended or suitable.\n\nThe US Nationwide Differential GPS System (NDGPS) is an augmentation system for users on U.S. land and waterways.\n\nThe augmentation may also take the form of additional information from navigation sensors being blended into the position calculation, or internal algorithms that improve the navigation performance. Many times the additional avionics operate via separate principles than the GNSS and are not necessarily subject to the same sources of error or interference. A system such as this is referred to as an aircraft-based augmentation system (ABAS) by the ICAO. The most widely used form of ABAS is receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM), which uses redundant GPS signals to ensure the integrity of the position solution, and to detect faulty signals.\n\nAdditional sensors may include:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13009", "title": "Galileo (satellite navigation)", "text": "Galileo (satellite navigation)\n\nGalileo is the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) that is being created by the European Union (EU) through the European GNSS Agency (GSA), headquartered in Prague in the Czech Republic, with two ground operations centres, Oberpfaffenhofen near Munich in Germany and Fucino in Italy. The €10 billion project is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European nations do not have to rely on the Russian GLONASS, Chinese BeiDou or U.S. GPS systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time.\nThe use of basic (lower-precision) Galileo services will be free and open to everyone. The higher-precision capabilities will be available for paying commercial users. Galileo is intended to provide horizontal and vertical position measurements within 1-metre precision, and better positioning services at higher latitudes than other positioning systems.\nGalileo is also to provide a new global search and rescue (SAR) function as part of the MEOSAR system. \n\nThe first Galileo test satellite, the GIOVE-A, was launched 28 December 2005, while the first satellite to be part of the operational system was launched on 21 October 2011. As of July 2018, 26 of the planned 30 active satellites are in orbit. Galileo started offering Early Operational Capability (EOC) on 15 December 2016, providing initial services with a weak signal, and is expected to reach Full Operational Capability (FOC) in 2019. The complete 30-satellite Galileo system (24 operational and 6 active spares) is expected by 2020.\n\nIn 1999, the different concepts of the three main contributors of ESA (Germany, France and Italy) for Galileo were compared and reduced to one by a joint team of engineers from all three countries. The first stage of the Galileo programme was agreed upon officially on 26 May 2003 by the European Union and the European Space Agency.\nThe system is intended primarily for civilian use, unlike the more military-oriented systems of the United States (GPS), Russia (GLONASS), and China (BeiDou-1/2). The European system will only be subject to shutdown for military purposes in extreme circumstances (like armed conflict). It will be available at its full precision to both civil and military users. The countries that contribute most to the Galileo Project are Germany and Italy.\n\nThe European Commission had some difficulty funding the project's next stage, after several allegedly \"per annum\" sales projection graphs for the project were exposed in November 2001 as \"cumulative\" projections which for each year projected included all previous years of sales. The attention that was brought to this multibillion-euro growing error in sales forecasts resulted in a general awareness in the Commission and elsewhere that it was unlikely that the program would yield the return on investment that had previously been suggested to investors and decision-makers.\nOn 17 January 2002, a spokesman for the project stated that, as a result of US pressure and economic difficulties, \"Galileo is almost dead.\"\n\nA few months later, however, the situation changed dramatically. European Union member states decided it was important to have a satellite-based positioning and timing infrastructure that the US could not easily turn off in times of political conflict.\n\nThe European Union and the European Space Agency agreed in March 2002 to fund the project, pending a review in 2003 (which was completed on 26 May 2003). The starting cost for the period ending in 2005 is estimated at €1.1 billion. The required satellites (the planned number is 30) were to be launched between 2011 and 2014, with the system up and running and under civilian control from 2019. The final cost is estimated at €3 billion, including the infrastructure on Earth, constructed in 2006 and 2007. The plan was for private companies and investors to invest at least two-thirds of the cost of implementation, with the EU and ESA dividing the remaining cost. The base \"Open Service\" is to be available without charge to anyone with a Galileo-compatible receiver, with an encrypted higher-bandwidth improved-precision \"Commercial Service\" available at a cost. By early 2011 costs for the project had run 50% over initial estimates.\n\nGalileo is intended to be an EU civilian GNSS that allows all users access to it. Initially GPS reserved the highest quality signal for military use, and the signal available for civilian use was intentionally degraded (Selective Availability). This changed with President Bill Clinton signing a policy directive in 1996 to turn off Selective Availability. Since May 2000 the same precision signal has been provided to both civilians and the military.\n\nSince Galileo was designed to provide the highest possible precision (greater than GPS) to anyone, the US was concerned that an enemy could use Galileo signals in military strikes against the US and its allies (some weapons like missiles use GNSSs for guidance). The frequency initially chosen for Galileo would have made it impossible for the US to block the Galileo signals without also interfering with its own GPS signals. The US did not want to lose their GNSS capability with GPS while denying enemies the use of GNSS. Some US officials became especially concerned when Chinese interest in Galileo was reported.\n\nAn anonymous EU official claimed that the US officials implied that they might consider shooting down Galileo satellites in the event of a major conflict in which Galileo was used in attacks against American forces. The EU's stance is that Galileo is a neutral technology, available to all countries and everyone. At first, EU officials did not want to change their original plans for Galileo, but have since reached the compromise that Galileo is to use a different frequency. This allowed the blocking or jamming of either GNSS without affecting the other.\n\nOne of the reasons given for developing Galileo as an independent system was that position information from GPS can be made significantly inaccurate by the deliberate application of universal Selective Availability (SA) by the US military. GPS is widely used worldwide for civilian applications; Galileo's proponents argued that civil infrastructure, including airplane navigation and landing, should not rely solely upon a system with this vulnerability.\n\nOn 2 May 2000, SA was disabled by the President of the United States, Bill Clinton; in late 2001 the entity managing the GPS confirmed that they did not intend to enable selective availability ever again. Though Selective Availability capability still exists, on 19 September 2007 the US Department of Defense announced that newer GPS satellites would not be capable of implementing Selective Availability;\nthe wave of Block IIF satellites launched in 2009, and all subsequent GPS satellites, are stated not to support SA. As old satellites are replaced in the GPS Block IIIA program, SA will cease to be an option. The modernisation programme also contains standardised features that allow GPS III and Galileo systems to inter-operate, allowing receivers to be developed to utilise GPS and Galileo together to create an even more accurate GNSS.\n\nIn June 2004, in a signed agreement with the United States, the European Union agreed to switch to a modulation known as BOC(1,1) (Binary Offset Carrier 1.1) allowing the coexistence of both GPS and Galileo, and the future combined use of both systems.\n\nThe European Union also agreed to address the \"mutual concerns related to the protection of allied and US national security capabilities.\"\n\nThe first experimental satellite, GIOVE-A, was launched in December 2005 and was followed by a second test satellite, GIOVE-B, launched in April 2008. After successful completion of the In-Orbit Validation (IOV) phase, additional satellites were launched. On 30 November 2007 the 27 EU transport ministers involved reached an agreement that Galileo should be operational by 2013, but later press releases suggest it was delayed to 2014.\n\nIn mid-2006 the public/private partnership fell apart, and the European Commission decided to nationalise the Galileo programme.\n\nIn early 2007 the EU had yet to decide how to pay for the system and the project was said to be \"in deep crisis\" due to lack of more public funds. German Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee was particularly doubtful about the consortium's ability to end the infighting at a time when only one testbed satellite had been successfully launched.\n\nAlthough a decision was yet to be reached, on 13 July 2007 EU countries discussed cutting €548m ($755m, £370m) from the union's competitiveness budget for the following year and shifting some of these funds to other parts of the financing pot, a move that could meet part of the cost of the union's Galileo satellite navigation system. European Union research and development projects could be scrapped to overcome a funding shortfall.\n\nIn November 2007, it was agreed to reallocate funds from the EU's agriculture and administration budgets and to soften the tendering process in order to invite more EU companies.\n\nIn April 2008, the EU transport ministers approved the Galileo Implementation Regulation. This allowed the €3.4bn to be released from the EU's agriculture and administration budgets to allow the issuing of contracts to start construction of the ground station and the satellites.\n\nIn June 2009, the European Court of Auditors published a report, pointing out governance issues, substantial delays and budget overruns that led to project stalling in 2007, leading to further delays and failures.\n\nIn October 2009, the European Commission cut the number of satellites definitively planned from 28 to 22, with plans to order the remaining six at a later time. It also announced that the first OS, PRS and SoL signal would be available in 2013, and the CS and SOL some time later. The €3.4 billion budget for the 2006–2013 period was considered insufficient. In 2010 the think-tank Open Europe estimated the total cost of Galileo from start to 20 years after completion at €22.2 billion, borne entirely by taxpayers. Under the original estimates made in 2000, this cost would have been €7.7 billion, with €2.6 billion borne by taxpayers and the rest by private investors.\n\nIn November 2009, a ground station for Galileo was inaugurated near Kourou (French Guiana).\n\nThe launch of the first four in-orbit validation (IOV) satellites was planned for the second half of 2011, and the launch of full operational capability (FOC) satellites was planned to start in late 2012.\n\nIn March 2010 it was verified that the budget for Galileo would only be available to provide the 4 IOV and 14 FOC satellites by 2014, with no funds then committed to bring the constellation above this 60% capacity. Paul Verhoef, the satellite navigation program manager at the European Commission, indicated that this limited funding would have serious consequences commenting at one point \"To give you an idea, that would mean that for three weeks in the year you will not have satellite navigation\" in reference to the proposed 18-vehicle constellation.\n\nIn July 2010, the European Commission estimated further delays and additional costs of the project to grow up to €1.5-€1.7 billion, and moved the estimated date of completion to 2018. After completion the system will need to be subsidised by governments at €750 million per year. An additional €1.9 billion was planned to be spent bringing the system up to the full complement of 30 satellites (27 operational + 3 active spares).\n\nIn December 2010, EU ministers in Brussels voted Prague, in the Czech Republic, as the headquarters of the Galileo project.\n\nIn January 2011, infrastructure costs up to 2020 were estimated at €5.3 billion. In that same month, Wikileaks revealed that Berry Smutny, the CEO of the German satellite company OHB-System, said that Galileo \"is a stupid idea that primarily serves French interests\". The BBC learned in 2011 that €500 million (£440M) would become available to make the extra purchase, taking Galileo within a few years from 18 operational satellites to 24.\n\nThe first two Galileo In-Orbit Validation satellites were launched by Soyuz ST-B flown from Guiana Space Centre on 21 October 2011, and the remaining two on 12 October 2012.\n\nTwenty-two further satellites with Full Operational Capability (FOC) were on order . The first four pairs of satellites were launched on 22 August 2014, 27 March 2015, 11 September 2015 and 17 December 2015.\n\nIn January 2017, news agencies reported that six of the passive hydrogen maser and three of the rubidium atomic clocks had failed. Four of the full operational satellites have each lost at least one clock; but no satellite has lost more than two. The operation of the constellation has not been affected as each satellite is launched with three spare clocks. The possibility of a systemic flaw is being considered.\nSpectraTime, the Swiss producer of both on-board clock types, declined to comment. According to ESA they concluded with their industrial partners for the rubidium atomic clocks that some implemented testing and operational measures were required. Additionally some refurbishment is required for the rubidium atomic clocks that still have to be launched. For the passive hydrogen masers operational measures are being studied to reduce the risk of failure. China and India use the same SpectraTime-built atomic clocks in their satellite navigation systems. ESA has contacted the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) who initially reported not having experienced similar failures. However, at the end of January 2017, Indian news outlets reported that all three clocks aboard the IRNSS-1A satellite (launched in July 2013 with a 10-year life expectancy) had failed and that a replacement satellite would be launched in the second half of 2017, these atomic clocks were said to be supplied under a four-million-euro deal.\nIn July 2017 the European Commission reported that the main causes of the malfunctions have been identified and measures have been put in place to reduce the possibility of further malfunctions of the satellites already in space.\nAccording to European sources ESA took measures to correct both identified sets of problems by replacing a faulty component that can cause a short circuit in the rubidium clocks and improve the passive hydrogen maser clocks as well on satellites still to be launched.\n\nIn September 2003, China joined the Galileo project. China was to invest €230 million (US$302 million, GBP 155 million, CNY 2.34 billion) in the project over the following years.\n\nIn July 2004, Israel signed an agreement with the EU to become a partner in the Galileo project.\n\nOn 3 June 2005 the EU and Ukraine signed an agreement for Ukraine to join the project, as noted in a press release.\n\nAs of November 2005, Morocco also joined the programme.\n\nIn Mid-2006, the Public-Private Partnership fell apart and the European Commission decided to nationalise Galileo as an EU programme.\n\nIn November 2006, China opted instead to upgrade BeiDou navigation system, its then-regional satellite navigation system. The decision was due to security concerns and issues with Galileo financing.\n\nOn 30 November 2007, the 27 member states of the European Union unanimously agreed to move forward with the project, with plans for bases in Germany and Italy. Spain did not approve during the initial vote, but approved it later that day. This greatly improved the viability of the Galileo project: \"The EU's executive had previously said that if agreement was not reached by January 2008, the long-troubled project would essentially be dead.\"\n\nOn 3 April 2009, Norway too joined the programme pledging €68.9 million toward development costs and allowing its companies to bid for the construction contracts. Norway, while not a member of the EU, is a member of ESA.\n\nOn 18 December 2013, Switzerland signed a cooperation agreement to fully participate in the program, and retroactively contributed €80 million for the period 2008–2013. As a member of ESA, it already collaborated in the development of the Galileo satellites, contributing the state-of-the-art hydrogen-maser clocks. Switzerland's financial commitment for the period 2014–2020 will be calculated in accordance with the standard formula applied for the Swiss participation in the EU research Framework Programme.\n\nIn March 2018, the European Commission announced that the United Kingdom may be excluded from parts of the project (especially relating to the secured service PRS) following its exit from the European Union (EU). As a result, Airbus plans to relocate work on the Ground Control Segment (GCS) from its Portsmouth premises to an EU state. British officials have been reported to be seeking legal advice on whether they can reclaim the €1.4 billion invested by the United Kingdom, of the €10 billion spent to date. In a speech at the EU Institute for Security Studies conference, the EU Chief Negotiator in charge of the Brexit negotiations, Michel Barnier, stressed the EU position that the UK had decided to leave the EU and thus all EU programmes, including Galileo. In August 2018, it was reported the UK will look to create a competing satellite navigation system to Galileo post-Brexit. In December 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the UK would no longer seek to reclaim the investment, and Science Minister Sam Gyimah resigned over the matter.\n\nAs of 2012, the system is scheduled to reach full operation in 2020 with the following specifications:\n\nThe system's orbit and signal accuracy is controlled by a ground segment consisting of:\n\nThe system transmits three signals: E1 (1575.42 MHz), E5 (1191.795 MHz) consisting of E5a (1176.45 MHz) and E5b (1207.14 MHz), and E6 (1278.75 MHz):\n\nThe Galileo system will have five main services:\n\nOther secondary services will also be available.\n\nEach Galileo satellite has two master passive hydrogen maser atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which are independent of one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10 or / s) translates into a positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate the time that it takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.\n\nThe onboard passive hydrogen maser and rubidium clocks are very stable over a few hours. If they were left to run indefinitely, though, their timekeeping would drift, so they need to be synchronized regularly with a network of even more stable ground-based reference clocks. These include active hydrogen maser clocks and clocks based on the caesium frequency standard, which show a far better medium and long-term stability than rubidium or passive hydrogen maser clocks. These clocks on the ground are gathered together within the parallel functioning Precise Timing Facilities in the Fucino and Oberpfaffhofen Galileo Control Centres. The ground based clocks also generate a worldwide time reference called Galileo System Time (GST), the standard for the Galileo system and are routinely compared to the local realizations of UTC, the UTC(k) of the European frequency and time laboratories.\n\nFor more information of the concept of global satellite navigation systems, see GNSS and GNSS positioning calculation.\n\nGalileo is to provide a new global search and rescue (SAR) function as part of the MEOSAR system. Satellites will be equipped with a transponder which will relay distress signals from emergency beacons to the Rescue coordination centre, which will then initiate a rescue operation. At the same time, the system is projected to provide a signal, the Return Link Message (RLM), \"to\" the emergency beacon, informing them that their situation has been detected and help is on the way. This latter feature is new and is considered a major upgrade compared to the existing Cospas-Sarsat system, which does not provide feedback to the user. Tests in February 2014 found that for Galileo's search and rescue function, operating as part of the existing International Cospas-Sarsat Programme, 77% of simulated distress locations can be pinpointed within 2 km, and 95% within 5 km.\n\nIn 2004 the Galileo System Test Bed Version 1 (GSTB-V1) project validated the on-ground algorithms for Orbit Determination and Time Synchronisation (OD&TS). This project, led by ESA and European Satellite Navigation Industries, has provided industry with fundamental knowledge to develop the mission segment of the Galileo positioning system.\n\n\nA third satellite, GIOVE-A2, was originally planned to be built by SSTL for launch in the second half of 2008. Construction of GIOVE-A2 was terminated due to the successful launch and in-orbit operation of GIOVE-B.\n\nThe GIOVE Mission segment operated by European Satellite Navigation Industries used the GIOVE-A/B satellites to provide experimental results based on real data to be used for risk mitigation for the IOV satellites that followed on from the testbeds. ESA organised the global network of ground stations to collect the measurements of GIOVE-A/B with the use of the GETR receivers for further systematic study. GETR receivers are supplied by Septentrio as well as the first Galileo navigation receivers to be used to test the functioning of the system at further stages of its deployment. Signal analysis of GIOVE-A/B data confirmed successful operation of all the Galileo signals with the tracking performance as expected.\n\nThese testbed satellites were followed by four IOV Galileo satellites that are much closer to the final Galileo satellite design. The Search & Rescue feature is also installed. The first two satellites were launched on 21 October 2011 from Guiana Space Centre using a Soyuz launcher, the other two on 12 October 2012. This enables key validation tests, since earth-based receivers such as those in cars and phones need to \"see\" a minimum of four satellites in order to calculate their position in three dimensions. Those 4 IOV Galileo satellites were constructed by Astrium GmbH and Thales Alenia Space. On 12 March 2013, a first fix was performed using those four IOV satellites. Once this In-Orbit Validation (IOV) phase has been completed, the remaining satellites will be installed to reach the Full Operational Capability.\n\nOn 7 January 2010, it was announced that the contract to build the first 14 FOC satellites was awarded to OHB System and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL).\nFourteen satellites will be built at a cost of €566M (£510M; $811M).\nArianespace will launch the satellites for a cost of €397M (£358M; $569M).\nThe European Commission also announced that the €85 million contract for system support covering industrial services required by ESA for integration and validation of the Galileo system had been awarded to Thales Alenia Space. Thales Alenia Space subcontract performances to Astrium GmbH and security to Thales Communications.\n\nIn February 2012, an additional order of eight satellites was awarded to OHB Systems for €250M ($327M), after outbidding EADS Astrium tender offer. Thus bringing the total to 22 FOC satellites.\n\nOn 7 May 2014, the first two FOC satellites landed in Guyana for their joint launch planned in summer Originally planned for launch during 2013, problems tooling and establishing the production line for assembly led to a delay of a year in serial production of Galileo satellites. These two satellites (Galileo satellites GSAT-201 and GSAT-202) were launched on 22 August 2014. The names of these satellites are Doresa and Milena named after European children who had previously won a drawing contest. On 23 August 2014, launch service provider Arianespace announced that the flight VS09 experienced anomaly and satellites were injected into an incorrect orbit.\n\nSatellites GSAT-203 and GSAT-204 were launched successfully on 27 March 2015 from Guiana Space Centre using a Soyuz four stage launcher. Using the same Soyuz launcher and launchpad, satellites GSAT-205 (Alba) and GSAT-206 (Oriana) were launched successfully on 11 September 2015.\n\nSatellites GSAT-208 (Liene) and GSAT-209 (Andriana) were successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, using the Soyuz launcher on December 17, 2015.\n\nSatellites GSAT-210 (Daniele) and GSAT-211 (Alizée) were launched on 24 May 2016.\n\nStarting in November 2016, deployment of the last twelve satellites will use a modified Ariane 5 launcher, named Ariane 5 ES, capable of placing four Galileo satellites into orbit per launch.\n\nSatellites GSAT-207 (Antonianna), GSAT-212 (Lisa), GSAT-213 (Kimberley), GSAT-214 (Tijmen) were successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, on 17 November 2016 on an Ariane 5 ES.\n\nOn 15 December 2016, Galileo started offering Initial Operational Capability (IOC). The services currently offered are Open Service, Public Regulated Service and Search and Rescue Service.\n\nSatellites GSAT-215 (Nicole), GSAT-216 (Zofia), GSAT-217 (Alexandre), GSAT-218 (Irina) were successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, on 12 December 2017 on an Ariane 5 ES.\n\nSatellites GSAT-219 (Tara), GSAT-220 (Samuel), GSAT-221 (Anna), GSAT-222 (Ellen) were successfully launched from Kourou, French Guiana, on 25 July 2018 on an Ariane 5 ES.\n\nAs of 2014, ESA and its industry partners have begun studies on Galileo Second Generation satellites, which will be presented to the EC for the late 2020s launch period. One idea is to employ electric propulsion, which would eliminate the need for an upper stage during launch and allow satellites from a single batch to be inserted into more than one orbital plane.\n\nIn July 2006 an international consortium of universities and research institutions embarked on a study of potential scientific applications of the Galileo constellation. This project, named GEO6, is a broad study oriented to the general scientific community, aiming to define and implement new applications of Galileo.\n\nAmong the various GNSS users identified by the Galileo Joint Undertaking, the GEO6, project addresses the Scientific User Community (UC).\n\nThe GEO6 project aims at fostering possible novel applications within the scientific UC of GNSS signals, and particularly of Galileo.\n\nThe AGILE project is an EU-funded project devoted to the study of the technical and commercial aspects of location-based services (LBS). It includes technical analysis of the benefits brought by Galileo (and EGNOS) and studies the hybridisation of Galileo with other positioning technologies (network-based, WLAN, etc.). Within these project, some pilot prototypes were implemented and demonstrated.\n\nOn the basis of the potential number of users, potential revenues for Galileo Operating Company or Concessionaire (GOC), international relevance, and level of innovation, a set of Priority Applications (PA) will be selected by the consortium and developed within the time-frame of the same project.\n\nThese applications will help to increase and optimise the use of the EGNOS services and the opportunities offered by the Galileo Signal Test-Bed (GSTB-V2) and the Galileo (IOV) phase.\n\nThe European Satellite Navigation project was selected as the main motif of a very high-value collectors' coin: the Austrian European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin, minted on 1 March 2006. The coin has a silver ring and gold-brown niobium \"pill\". In the reverse, the niobium portion depicts navigation satellites orbiting the Earth. The ring shows different modes of transport, for which satellite navigation was developed: an airplane, a car, a lorry, a train and a container ship.\n\nA number of devices are compatible with Galileo. Samsung Galaxy S8, Moto X4, Apple iPhone 8 / Apple iPhone X and later devices and BQ Aquaris X5 Plus are compatible with Galileo, the first mainstream smartphones advertised with this capability.\n\nUntil late 2018, GNSS was not authorized for use in the United States, and as such, only variably worked on devices that could receive Galileo signals, within United States territory. The Federal Communications Commission's position on the matter was (and remains) that non-GPS radio navigation satellite systems (RNSS) receivers must be granted a license to receive said signals. A waiver of this requirement for Galileo was requested by the EU and submitted in 2015, and on January 6, 2017, public comment on the matter was requested. On November 15, 2018, the FCC granted the requested waiver, explicitly allowing non-federal consumer devices to access Galileo E1 and E5 frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "426410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=426410", "title": "Hallstatt", "text": "Hallstatt\n\nHallstatt (; Central Bavarian: \"Hoistod\") is a small town in the district of Gmunden, in the Austrian state of Upper Austria. \nSituated between the southwestern shore of Hallstätter See and the steep slopes of the Dachstein massif, the town lies in Salzkammergut region, on the national road linking Salzburg and Graz. \n\nHallstatt is known for its production of salt, dating back to prehistoric times, and gave its name to the Hallstatt culture, the archaeological culture linked to Proto-Celtic and early Celtic people of the Early Iron Age in Europe, c.800–450 BC. \n\nHallstatt is at the core of the \"Hallstatt-Dachstein/Salzkammergut Cultural Landscape\" declared as one of the World Heritage Sites in Austria by UNESCO in 1997.\n\nIn 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer (1795–1874) discovered a large prehistoric cemetery at the Salzberg mines near Hallstatt (), which he excavated during the second half of the 19th century. Eventually the excavation would yield 1,045 burials, although no settlement has yet been found. This may be covered by the later village, which has long occupied the whole narrow strip between the steep hillsides and the lake. \n\nSome 1,300 burials have been found, including around 2,000 individuals, with women and children but few infants. Nor is there a \"princely\" burial, as often found near large settlements. Instead, there are a large number of burials varying considerably in the number and richness of the grave goods, but with a high proportion containing goods suggesting a life well above subsistence level. \n\nThe community at Hallstatt exploited the salt mines in the area, which had been worked from time to time since the Neolithic period, from the 8th to 5th centuries BC. The style and decoration of the grave goods found in the cemetery are very distinctive, and artifacts made in this style are widespread in Europe. In the mine workings themselves, the salt has preserved many organic materials such as textiles, wood and leather, and many abandoned artefacts such as shoes, pieces of cloth, and tools including miner's backpacks, have survived in good condition. \n\nFinds at Hallstatt extend from about 1200 BC until around 500 BC, and are divided by archaeologists into four phases:\nHallstatt A-B are part of the Bronze Age Urnfield culture. Phase A saw Villanovan influence. In this period, people were cremated and buried in simple graves. In phase B, tumulus (barrow or kurgan) burial becomes common, and cremation predominates. Little is known about this period in which the typical Celtic elements have not yet distinguished themselves from the earlier Villanova-culture.\nThe \"Hallstatt period\" proper is restricted to HaC and HaD (8th to 5th centuries BC), corresponding to the early European Iron Age. Hallstatt lies in the area where the western and eastern zones of the Hallstatt culture meet, which is reflected in the finds from there. Hallstatt D is succeeded by the La Tène culture.\n\nHallstatt C is characterized by the first appearance of iron swords mixed amongst the bronze ones. Inhumation and cremation co-occur.\nFor the final phase, Hallstatt D, daggers, almost to the exclusion of swords, are found in western zone graves ranging from c. 600–500 BC. There are also differences in the pottery and brooches. Burials were mostly inhumations. Halstatt D has been further divided into the sub-phases D1-D3, relating only to the western zone, and mainly based on the form of brooches.\n\nMajor activity at the site appears to have finished about 500 BC, for reasons that are unclear. Many Hallstatt graves were robbed, probably at this time. There was widespread disruption throughout the western Hallstatt zone, and the salt workings had by then become very deep. By then the focus of salt mining had shifted to the nearby Hallein Salt Mine, with graves at Dürrnberg nearby where there are significant finds from the late Hallstatt and early La Tène periods. \n\nMuch of the material from early excavations was dispersed, and is now found in many collections, especially German and Austrian museums, but the Hallstatt Museum in the town has the largest collection.\n\nThere are no recorded notable events that took place in Hallstatt during Roman rule or the early Middle Ages. In 1311, the Hallstatt citizens were vested with market rights by Queen dowager Elizabeth, a sign that it had not lost its economic value. Today, apart from production of salt, which since 1595 has been transported 40 kilometres from Hallstatt to Ebensee via a brine pipeline, tourism plays a major factor in the town's economic life. \n\nTourists are told that Hallstatt is the site of \"the world's oldest pipeline\", which was constructed 400 years ago from 13,000 hollowed-out trees. There is so little space for cemeteries that every ten years bones used to be exhumed and removed into an ossuary, to make room for new burials. A collection of elaborately decorated skulls with the deceased's name, profession, date of death inscribed on them is on display at the local chapel.\n\nUntil the late 19th century, it was only possible to reach Hallstatt by boat or via narrow trails. The land between the lake and mountains was sparse, and the town itself exhausted every free patch of it. Access between houses on the river bank was by boat or over the \"upper path\", a small corridor passing through attics. The first road to Hallstatt was only built in 1890, along the west shore, partially by rock blasting. Nevertheless, this secluded and inhospitable landscape counts as one of the first places of human settlement due to the rich sources of natural salt, which have been mined for thousands of years, originally in the shape of hearts owing to the use of antler picks. \n\nSome of Hallstatt's oldest archaeological finds, such as a shoe-last celt, date back to around 5500 BC. In 1846 Johann Georg Ramsauer discovered a large prehistoric cemetery near the current location of Hallstatt. Ramsauer's work at the Hallstatt cemeteries continued until 1863, unearthing more than 1000 burials. It is to his credit and to the enormous benefit of archaeology that he proceeded to excavate each one with the same slow, methodical care as the first. \n\nHis methods included measuring and drawing each find. In an age before colour photography, he produced very detailed watercolours of each assemblage before it was removed from the ground. In the history of archaeology Ramsauer's work at Hallstatt helped usher in a new, more systematic way of doing archaeology. In addition, one of the first blacksmith sites was excavated there. Active trade, and thus wealth, allowed for the development of a highly developed culture, which, after findings in the Salzberghochtal, was named the Hallstatt culture. This lasted from approximately 800 to 500 BC.\n\nSeats in the municipal assembly (\"Gemeinderat\") as of 2015 local elections:\nAlexander Scheutz (SPÖ) has been mayor of Hallstatt since 2009.\n\nHallstatt is twinned with:\n\nOn 16 June 2011, plans to build a replica in China were first reported. On 2 June 2012, it was reported that Chinese mining company China Minmetals Corporation built a full-scale replica of the entire town in Huizhou, Guangdong province.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1331939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1331939", "title": "Hegemon of Thasos", "text": "Hegemon of Thasos\n\nHegemon of Thasos () was a Greek writer of the Old Comedy. Hardly anything is known of him, except that he flourished during the Peloponnesian War. According to Aristotle (\"Poetics\", ii. 5) he was the inventor of a kind of parody; by slightly altering the wording in well-known poems he transformed the sublime into the ridiculous. When the news of the disastrous defeat of the Sicilian Expedition reached Athens, his parody of the \"Gigantomachia\" was being performed: it is said that the audience were so amused by it that, instead of leaving to show their grief, they remained in their seats.

Tala Canta Ilabe was the last Inca who celebrated Inti Raymi in its Ushnu.\n\nThe word \"Chena\" means puma in estrous cycle in the Quechuan language.\n\nConstructed during the domination of the Qullasuyu, the fortress of Chena Mountain is located at Cucará Point, up to where one accedes for the Catemito Road.\n\nIn 1976, archeologist Rubén Stehberg published the report \"Chena's Fortress and its relation with the inca occupation of central Chile\". The topographic raising that the engineer Hans Niemeyer realised at it, emphasised the needings of a researcher in archaeology.\n\nThis fortress possesses a set of nine enclosures placed in the summit of the hill and of two defensive walls of surrounding. The first approximation to a new interpretation, was published in 1991. This one points that the perimeter of the walls of the pucara, it suggests the form of an animal, possibly a feline. And the defensive walls would not be such but three areas of the Inca cosmovision .\n\nThis form similar to an animal (unique in Chile), is similar to the figure of a puma that was represented in the plant of the cardinal city of Inca Empire, Cusco.\n\nSarmiento de Gamboa indicated that the city was conceived for you builders with the form of a puma. Fernando and Edgardo Elorrieta, describe great quantity of incaic buildings located in the sacred valley, which forms of animals resemble, some of them related to the dark constellations that they saw in the night sky. Also they describe associations of these buildings with the astronomy.\n\nThe back part of this feline, presents openings of doors, corridors and separations between walls, which allow the step of the first beam of the Sun in solstice and equinox. The step of the first beam of the Sun in the winter solstice on (June 21) across four doors crosses a sense. During the dawn of the summer solstice (December 21) a months later, the last beam of the Sun crosses the inverse way.\n\nIn 1996, published a new article in a magazine of Engineering.\n\nIt approached a new offer of interpretation, according to which the pucara might be a ritual site and an astronomic observatory not a fortress. The abundant specialized literature indicates that the Inca astronomers realised observations of high precision and were constructing observatories along the territory that they were occupying. These observatories were necessary for elaboration of calendars with agricultural, religious, civil purposes, etc. Boccas, penetrates into this line of analysis.\n\nDue to the big distances that normally existed between villages and the need to cross them afoot, makes presume that every accession of relative importance, was relying on an observatory that was allowing the inhabitants, your own and one handled calendar. The Inca accession that the Spanish found on having come to the valley of Santiago surely was not the exception. The date in which the Sun passes for nadir (antizenith) also was known, and a temporary axis was forming with the step for zenith. In the Inca city Wanuku Pampa Aveni discovered two important buildings which orientation is glaringly different from the rest of the city: they align with the axis( zenith - anticenit, which names later \" standard time of Cuzco \", since he suggests that the Incas, on not having been able to apply the same temporary criteria in all your empire (s passed the tropics, the Sun never passes for the zenith - Chena's case-), had to support a calendar coherence between remote places of your empire and the capital. In Chena, we have not seen this type of alignment towards \"Cuzco's time zone\".\n\nJune 21 is the holiday of Inti Raymi, new year Inca. If the Inca was stopping in the beginning of the most short red line, he was observing the first beam of the Sun went out across a groove between two walls. The Sun was rising after Ushnu or altar. During the celebration of the Inti Raymi of 2006 in the pucara, the young archeologist and mountaneer Ricardo Moyano observed the exit of the Sun and recognized hills the depression in where the Sun goes out, as the so-called Portezuelo del Inca. Up to this moment this name did not have explanation. From this observation, in Stehberg's opinion, it might be a question of the first line of ceque found in Santiago. In Cuzco, the ceques were consisting of imaginary lines that Coricancha was departing from and they were going towards every huaca, shaping a whole of 328 huacas. They were fulfilling functions of political, social and religious order. The Coricancha was the principal temple of the Inca culture.\n\nTo the dawn of the equinox, the Sun crosses the door of the enclosure orient and then crosses the corridor. To the late afternoon it realizes the inverse way. The diagonal of the corridor of access indicates the line North - South.\n\nBy means of this simple method, and using mud and stones as materials of construction, the astronomers Incas were achieving observations of great precision.\n\nFor example, to determine the astronomic or geographical north, is enough to observe the point of exit and the point of putting of the star Vega (Lira's Alpha), \"Urcu Chillay\" or macho calls for the Incas, about the winter solstice. Then to look for the average point, this represents the north. Probably this simple method allowed to the former astronomers to determine the axis North - South. The following scheme, product of more than one decade of observation in situ of astronomic events, shows the system of astronomic observation to simple sight, probably used by the Incas astronomers to design the pucara and then to realize your observations of the apparent movement of the stars.\n\nThe surrise of the winter solstice occurs in a \"key\" point from Chena's ushnu: the intersection of the most nearby horizon (Chena's cord) and of the most distant (mountain chain of the Coast). In addition, in this precise direction one finds the summit of the highest hill (1.166 msnm) that reaches to the south of the Cuesta Zapata. This detail might not be a coincidence, but a topographic important requirement, due to the association known about the high hills with the worship to the water in several cultures\n\nA huaca (Quechuan \"Wak'a\") is a sacred place, a space of ritual use. The previous descriptions seem to indicate that Chena's Pucará was and it is a huaca.\nThe reasons that they support this place as ceremonial and not as military compound:\n\n\nAt basement of the monunt they found also two cemeteries, presumably diaguita, separated one of other one for approximately . The diaguitas, for the especial preoccupation showed in your burials, think that they have a life post-death in which the flame has a basic role. The dual ceramics appear towards the belief of the existence of two worlds in which them shamanthat they are the link. With the arrival of the Incas there was brought the tradition of doing altars in the highest hills of the valley\n\nIn contrast with this physical abandon, in the last decade, diverse groups and persons are re-discovering the pucara. QuechuanAymará distinguishes the community from Santiago, which realizes negotiations with the authorities in order to recover the Huaca de Chena as a ritual space for the new generations of descendants from the original Andean etnias. The communities estimate importantly that the descendants from the Andean villages could recover this sacred place (nowadays in virtual abandon), to possess a ritual own space inside the city. This would allow them to establish a physical and spiritual link with your cultural inheritance.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37327056", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37327056", "title": "Illusive Man", "text": "Illusive Man\n\nThe Illusive Man is a fictional character in BioWare's \"Mass Effect\" video game franchise. He is the leader of the pro-human group Cerberus. The Illusive Man wears an open suit that connotes both futuristic style and the \"casual swagger of a charming billionaire\". His eye implants make him appear slightly inhuman. He is normally seen in an empty office with no indication of his living arrangements. He is voiced by Martin Sheen.\n\nThe character first appeared in 2008's novel \"\", and made his video game debut in \"Mass Effect 2\" as a supporting character. In the game, he arranges to revive Commander Shepard from death, provides Shepard with a ship and crew, and sends Shepard on several missions against the human-abducting Collectors. The Illusive Man later appears in \"Mass Effect 3\" as one of the main antagonists, where he works against Shepard's attempts to destroy the Reapers, wishing to control them instead. He appears in several other \"Mass Effect\" comics series and novels. \"Mass Effect: Evolution\" tells his origin story.\n\nHis critical reception has been positive, with Martin Sheen praised for his voice acting. However, some criticized \"Mass Effect 2\"s story for forcing the player to work with the Illusive Man and Cerberus despite their antagonistic role in the first game.\n\nThe Illusive Man is the leader of Cerberus, a pro-human group officially regarded as a terrorist organisation by the Citadel Council and the humans' Systems Alliance. The character was voiced by Martin Sheen in both \"Mass Effect 2\" and \"3\". According to Casey Hudson, Sheen really got into the role. Sheen has said he would suck on a pen to simulate smoking when recording lines, as he himself did not smoke.\n\nAt one point, the Illusive Man was planned as the boss fight for \"Mass Effect 3\", having been altered by the Reapers. However, this was changed to avoid a clichéd ending. Additionally, BioWare felt it did not fit the Illusive Man—the Illusive Man's \"weapon\" being his intelligence, not physical strength—and wanted to let the player fight a character they recognised.\n\nHis face was based off a catalog model, a decision made early in his development. He is largely symmetrical, and is meant to appear almost \"perfect\". He smokes, drinks, and is in his fifties but shows no signs of age due to in-universe medical improvements. His eye implants were designed to make him appear slightly inhuman. These implants are explained in \"Evolution\" as the result of interaction with a mysterious artifact that huskified those who directly touched it. For his indoctrinated appearance in \"Mass Effect 3\", numerous facial concepts were drawn to determine just how much the character had been indoctrinated, with some referencing Saren Arterius (the main antagonist of the first \"Mass Effect\" game).\n\nHis suit was designed to both be recognizable as a suit and to combine \"an impeccable futuristic style\" and \"the casual swagger of a charming billionaire\". While the suit was designed with futuristic style in mind, it also had to not fit into any particular decade. It was decided that the Illusive Man's suit should be open, in order to give the impression he could do whatever he pleased.\n\nThe Illusive Man's main setting is his spacious and barren office. His personal quarters are never shown. The holographic computer terminals surrounding his office desk serve two functions: to show his connection to \"a vast web of information\" while decreasing his humanity for only communicating through holograms. He does not see actual people, but rather only facsimiles of them. His office view of a dying star reinforces his desire for full control of his environment. Only a small amount of concept art was made for the Illusive Man's room.\n\nThe Illusive Man is described as believing \"the end justifies the means\", and was made to be morally gray. John Jackson Miller, who penned the script for \"Mass Effect: Evolution\", \"Invasion\", and \"Redemption\", personally viewed him as a searcher that saw a \"darker side to some of the great things humanity's discovered\", the object of his search. During the course of the games, the writers did not want to reveal too much about him. His character development's \"basic idea\" was \"one of these guys we don't know much about\". BioWare considered his backstory and motivations, but could not elaborate in the games due to this narrative technique.\n\nA \"shadowy puppetmaster\", he is also a smoker, a womaniser and a drinker, but is very charming. This helps him serve as a foil to the Commander. Adrien Cho, producer for \"Mass Effect 2\", described him as being both the best and worst traits of humanity rolled into one person.\n\n\"Mass Effect 2\", a 2010 action role-playing video game, marked the Illusive Man's first in-game appearance. The player character and protagonist, Commander Shepard, is recalled to life by the Illusive Man's Cerberus after being killed by an unknown ship at the beginning of the game. The Illusive Man debriefs and tells Shepard about how the someone has been abducting human colonies and may be working with the Reapers, a sentient machine race dedicated to wiping out all organic life. In order to help Shepard launch an assault on the Reaper base, he provides the Commander with a ship, crew, and dossiers on potential squadmates. Over the course of the game, he sends Shepard to investigate Freedom's Progress, a recently abducted colony where Shepard discovers that the Collectors are behind the attack; Horizon, a colony in the process of being abducted; and a Collector ship, which turns out to be a trap—one that the Illusive Man knew about. At the end of the game, the Illusive Man sends Shepard to the Collector base, where the player decides whether to disable and turn over the base, or to destroy the base and cut all ties with Cerberus.\n\nThe character returns in the game's sequel, \"Mass Effect 3\", released on March 6, 2012. He is first seen as a hologram on Mars when Shepard is retrieving data to stop the concurrent Reaper invasion of Earth. The Illusive Man tells Shepard his plan to control the Reapers and attempts to foil Shepard when Shepard resists. Over the course of the game, the Illusive Man commands Cerberus to attack the planet Sur'Kesh, homeworld of the salarians, to instigate a war between two allied races and to take control of the allied interspecies forces' base, the Citadel. He makes another appearance on the asari home planet, Thessia, where he again tries to convince Shepard that controlling the Reapers is the best solution. Shepard refuses and suggests that the Illusive Man is indoctrinated. In response, the Illusive Man commands the assassin Kai Leng to steal vital information necessary to combat the Reapers. Shepard tracks the VI to Cerberus's headquarters and discovers videos of the Illusive Man having himself implanted with Reaper technology and warning Kai Leng of Shepard. In these videos, the Illusive Man shows the Commander a great deal of respect. The Illusive Man makes his penultimate appearance at the headquarters. The Illusive Man appears at the Citadel in the endgame. Depending on prior in-game choices, players then decide whether to shoot him, or to convince him that he is indoctrinated, which makes him shoot himself. If the player shoots him he remarks how beautiful Earth is while gazing out through the Citadel arms, wishing Shepard could see it the same way, before succumbing to his wounds.\n\nOutside of the video games, the Illusive Man had earlier appeared in the 2008 \"\", the 2010 comic series \"\", and the 2010 novel \"\", wherein the Illusive Man becomes obsessed with indoctrination and decides to study it.\n\nThe \"Mass Effect: Evolution\" comics series was announced to expand on the Illusive Man's backstory, and was released throughout 2011. The story opens during the First Contact War, the war between the alien turians and the humans after humanity discovered alien life and the Mass Relays. The Illusive Man is Jack Harper, a mercenary working for the Human System Alliance under the command of General Williams. In one incident, Jack leads two other mercenaries, Ben Hislop and Eva Coré, in attacking a group of turians, and captures one as prisoner. The turian, named Desolas Arterius, lead them to an artifact that turns Ben into a zombie-like monster and leaves Jack with strange eyes and the mysterious ability to understanding alien languages. After being captured and subsequently released by the Turians, Jack begins to search for clues about his mysterious visions of destruction. He and Eva were later captured by Desolas and his brother Saren who revealed to have custody of Ben. The Jack and Eva are brought to a temple on the turian homeworld of Palaven where Desolas has excavated an artifact. Desolas reveals that he plans to use the artifact to create a new breed of turian soldiers. Jack realizes that the new turians would be feral and dangerous, but Desolas ignores his warning. Jack manages to convince Saren that converted turians are a threat just as they begin to turn on Desolas. In the end, Jack escapes as the turian military destroy the beacon and the converted turians. However, he loses both Ben and Eva and creates a manifesto for Cerberus in their name.\n\nIn \"\", a 2012 novel, the Illusive Man is targeted by an extremist group, The Biotic Underground.\n\nThe Illusive Man is the main antagonist of \"Mass Effect: Invasion\", a 2012 comic series.\n\nThe character appears in the fourth issue of the 2012 \"Mass Effect: Homeworlds\", where he monitors Liara for her Prothean research on Reaper-defeating technologies. He sends a Phantom to kill her, which she defeats. He attempts to contact her afterwards. claiming the phantom to be a rogue agent, and proposes an alliance between the two. Liara is not convinced and cuts him off.\n\nThe Illusive Man was received well, and gained accolades for his appearance in \"Mass Effect 2\". IGN called him the best PC character of 2010: \"[a]n enigma, a crusader, an agent of calm in a vortex of chaos\". In a vote for by \"Game Informer\" for their top 30 favorite characters of the 2000s decade, the Illusive Man placed 27th. Giant Bomb's 2010 Game of the Year listed the Illusive Man as the character with which they would most like to party. \"Game Informer\"s Joe Juba listed the Illusive Man's appearance in \"\" as a reason to read the book. Dan Ryckert, also writing for \"Game Informer\", felt that Bruce Greenwood would best suit the character in the forthcoming \"Mass Effect\" film. When comparing \"Mass Effect\" to previous works that may have inspired the series, IGN's Christopher Monfette compared the character to the Smoking Man from \"The X-Files\". GamesRadar praised his moral sense, putting Illusive Man in their 2013 list of the best villains in video game history at number 14.\n\nMartin Sheen was praised for his voice acting. Sheen was nominated for best performance by a human male at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, and David Houghton, writing for GamesRadar, listed it as an example of \"[w]hen celebrity voice-acting goes very right\". When reviewing \"Mass Effect 2\", IGN's Erik Brudvig called Sheen's performance a \"high point\" in the game's cast. Similarly, Gameplanet's Aylon Herbet called him a \"show-stealing personality\".\n\nTom Francis of \"PC Gamer\" criticized how the player was forced to work with the Illusive Man and Cerberus in \"Mass Effect 2\", saying that it was an interesting idea if an option, but \"it's just frustrating\" if the player was forced to do it. Nic Vargus, writing for GamesRadar, felt similarly and called it \"one of the biggest narrative stretches in \"Mass Effect\"\".\n"}
{"id": "1789504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1789504", "title": "Indian art", "text": "Indian art\n\nIndian art consists of a variety of art forms, including plastic arts (e.g., pottery, sculpture), visual arts (e.g., paintings), performing arts and textile arts (e.g. woven silk). Geographically, it spans the entire Indian subcontinent, including what is now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and eastern Afghanistan. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern and traditional forms.\n\nThe origin of Indian art can be traced to pre-historic settlements in the 3rd millennium BC. On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups.\n\nIn historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. Indian funeral and philosophic traditions exclude grave goods, which is the main source of ancient art in other cultures.\nRock art of India includes rock relief carvings, engravings and paintings. It is estimated there are about 1300 rock art sites with over a quarter of a million figures and figurines. The earliest rock carvings in India were discovered by Archibald Carlleyle, twelve years before the Cave of Altamira in Spain, although his work only came to light much later via J Cockburn (1899).\n\nDr. V. S. Wakankar discovered several painted rock shelters in Central India, situated around the Vindhya mountain range. Of these, the Bhimbetka rock shelters have been deemed a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The paintings in these sites commonly depicted scenes of human life alongside animals, and hunts with stone implements. Their style varied with region and age, but the most common characteristic was a red wash made using a powdered mineral called \"geru\", which is a form of Iron Oxide (Hematite).\n\nFor further details on the rock art of India, please see South Asian Stone Age.\n\nDespite its widespread and sophistication, the Indus Valley civilization seems to have taken no interest in public large-scale art, unlike many other early civilizations. A number of gold, terracotta and stone figurines of girls in dancing poses reveal the presence of some forms of dance. Additionally, the terracotta figurines included cows, bears, monkeys, and dogs. The animal depicted on a majority of seals at sites of the mature period has not been clearly identified. Part bull, part zebra, with a majestic horn, it has been a source of speculation. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to substantiate claims that the image had religious or cultist significance, but the prevalence of the image raises the question of whether or not the animals in images of the IVC are religious symbols. The most famous piece is the bronze \"Dancing Girl\" of Mohenjo-Daro, which shows remarkably advanced modelling of the human figure for this early date.\n\nSeals have been found at Mohenjo-Daro depicting a figure standing on its head, and another sitting cross-legged in what some call a yoga-like pose. This figure, sometimes known as a \"Pashupati\", has been variously identified. Sir John Marshall identified a resemblance to the Hindu god, Shiva.\n\nAfter the end of the Indus Valley Civilization, there is a surprising absence of art of any great degree of sophistication until the Buddhist era. It is thought that this partly reflects the use of perishable organic materials such as wood.\n\nThe north Indian Maurya Empire flourished from 322 BCE to 185 BCE, and at its maximum extent controlled all of the sub-continent except the extreme south as well as influences from Indian ancient traditions, and Ancient Persia, as shown by the Pataliputra capital.\n\nThe emperor Ashoka, who died in 232 BCE, adopted Buddhism about half-way through his 40-year reign, and patronized several large stupas at key sites from the life of the Buddha, although very little decoration from the Mauryan period survives, and there may not have been much in the first place. There is more from various early sites of Indian rock-cut architecture. The most famous survivals are the large animals surmounting several of the Pillars of Ashoka, which showed a confident and boldly mature style and craft and first of its kind iron casting without rust until date, which was in use by vedic people in rural areas of the country, though we have very few remains showing its development. The famous detached Lion Capital of Ashoka, with four animals, was adopted as the official Emblem of India after Indian independence. Many small popular terracotta figurines are recovered in archaeology, in a range of often vigorous if somewhat crude styles.\n\nThe major survivals of Buddhist art begin in the period after the Mauryans, from which good quantities of sculpture survives after many Hindu, buddhist and jain temples destroyed by mughal rulers time to time. some key sites such as Sanchi, Bharhut and Amaravati, some of which remain \"in situ\", with others in museums in India or around the world. Stupas were surrounded by ceremonial fences with four profusely carved toranas or ornamental gateways facing the cardinal directions. These are in stone, though clearly adopting forms developed in wood. They and the walls of the stupa itself can be heavily decorated with reliefs, mostly illustrating the lives of the Buddha. Gradually life-size figures were sculpted, initially in deep relief, but then free-standing. Mathura was the most important centre in this development, which applied to Hindu and Jain art as well as Buddhist. The facades and interiors of rock-cut \"chaitya\" prayer halls and monastic \"viharas\" have survived better than similar free-standing structures elsewhere, which were for long mostly in wood. The caves at Ajanta, Karle, Bhaja and elsewhere contain early sculpture, often outnumbered by later works such as iconic figures of the Buddha and bodhisattvas, which are not found before 100 CE at the least.\n\nBuddhism developed an increasing emphasis on statues of the Buddha, which was greatly influenced by Hindu and Jain religious figurative art, The figures of this period which were also influenced by the Greco-Buddhist art of the centuries after the defeat of Alexander the Great. This fusion developed in the far north-west of India, especially Gandhara in modern Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Indian Kushan Empire spread from Central Asia to include northern India in the early centuries CE, and briefly commissioned large statues that were portraits of the royal dynasty, Mughal miniature.\n\n\"Main article:\" Shunga Empire\n\nWith the fall of the Maurya Empire, control of India was returned to the older custom of regional dynasties, one of the most significant of which was the Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 BCE - 72 BCE) of central India. During this period, as well as during the Satavahana Dynasty which occurred concurrently with the Shunga Dynasty in south India, some of the most significant early Buddhist architecture was created. Arguably, the most significant architecture of this dynasty is the stupa, a religious monument which usually holds a sacred relic of Buddhism. These relics were often, but not always, in some way directly connected to the Buddha. Due to the fact that these stupas contained remains of the Buddha himself, each stupa was venerated as being an extension of the Buddha's body, his enlightenment, and of his achievement of nirvana. The way in which Buddhists venerate the stupa is by walking around it in a clockwise manner. \n\nOne of the most notable examples of the Buddhist stupa from the Shunga Dynasty is The Great Stupa at Sanchi, which was thought to be founded by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka c. 273 BCE - 232 BCE during the Maurya Empire. The Great Stupa was enlarged to its present diameter of 120 feet, covered with a stone casing, topped with a balcony and umbrella, and encircled with a stone railing during the Shunga Dynasty c. 150 BCE - 50 BCE. \n\n\"Main article: Satavahana Dynasty\"\nSatavahana dynasty was originally under the rule in central India, and after 1st century CE, in the south region. During Satavahana dynasty, a great number of significant Buddhist artworks were produced during this period. Stupas and temples are the most typical Buddhist architectures in this period. Stupas are religious monuments built on burial mounds, which contain relics beneath a solid dome. Stupas in different areas of India may vary in structure, size, and design; however, their representational meanings are quite similar. They are designed based on mandala, a graph of cosmos specific to Buddhism. A traditional stupa has a railing that provides a sacred path for Buddhist followers to practice devotional circumambulation in ritual settings. Also, ancient Indians considered caves as sacred places since they were habitants of holy men and monks. The Chaitya was constructed from a cave. \n\"Main article: Kushan Empire\"\n\nOfficially established by Kujula Kadphises, the first Kushan emperor who united the Yuezhi tribes, Kushan empire was a syncretic empire in central Asia. In this period, Kushan art inherited the Greco-Buddhist art, and the depictions of Buddha himself first appeared in art. Wearing a monk’s robe and a long length of cloth draped over the left shoulder and around the body, the Buddha was depicted with 32 major lakshanas (distinguishing marks), including a golden-colored body, an ushnisha (a protuberance) on the top of his head, heavy earrings, elongated earlobes, long arms, the impression of a chakra (wheel) on the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet, and the urna (a mark between his eyebrows). \n\nThe Gupta period is generally regarded as a classic peak of north Indian art for all the major religious groups. Although painting was evidently widespread, the surviving works are almost all religious sculpture. The period saw the emergence of the iconic carved stone deity in Hindu art, as well as the Buddha-figure and Jain \"tirthankara\" figures, these last often on a very large scale. The two great centers of sculpture were Mathura and Gandhara, the latter the center of Greco-Buddhist art.\n\nAlthough the Gupta period marked the \"golden age\" of classical Hinduism, the early architectural style of Hindu temples were sophisticated and scientific in nature, consisting large courtyards, garbh grah, siting area, prayer area a large complex and well planned architecture. This is in stark contrast to the complex plans with multiple \"shikaras\" (towers) and \"mandapas\" (halls) of various utility as stated in veda outlining building of temples.\n\nInscriptions on the Pillars of Ashoka mention coexistence of the northern kingdoms with the triumvirate of Chola, Chera and Pandya Tamil dynasties, situated south of the Vindhya mountains. The medieval period witnessed the rise and fall of these kingdoms, in conjunction with other kingdoms in the area. It is during the decline and resurgence of these kingdoms that Hinduism was renewed. It fostered the construction of numerous temples and sculptures. \n\nThe Shore Temple at Mamallapuram constructed by the Pallavas symbolizes early Hindu architecture, with its monolithic rock relief and sculptures of Hindu deities. They were succeeded by Chola rulers who were prolific in their pursuit of the arts. The Great Living Chola Temples of this period are known for their maturity, grandeur and attention to detail, and have been recognized as a UNESCO Heritage Site. The Chola period is also known for its bronze sculptures, the lost-wax casting technique and fresco paintings. Thanks to the Hindu kings of the Chalukya dynasty, Jainism flourished alongside Islam evidenced by the fourth of the Badami cave temples being Jain instead of Vedic. The kingdoms of South India continued to rule their lands until the Muslim invasions that established sultanates there and destroyed much of the temples and marvel examples of architectures and sculptures\n\nRecognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Khajuraho group of monuments were constructed by the Chandela clan of the Rajput dynasties. Apart from the usual Hindu temples, 10% of the sculptures depict twisted bodies of men and women that shed light on the everyday socio-cultural and religious practices in Medieval India. Ever since their discovery, the degree of sexuality depicted in these sculptures has drawn both negative and positive criticism from scholars, ranging from \"the degeneration of the Hindu mind\"\n\nThe Khajuraho temples were in active use under Hindu kingdoms, until the establishment of the Delhi Sultanates of the 13th century. Under Muslim rule until the 18th century, many of Khajuraho's monuments were destroyed, but a few ruins still remain.\n\nAlthough Islamic footholds in India were made as early as the first half of the 10th century, it wasn't until the Mughal Empire that one observes emperors with a patronage for the fine arts. Emperor Humayun, during his reestablishment of the Delhi Sultanate in 1555, brought with him Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd al-Samad, two of the finest painters from Persian Shah Tahmasp's renowned atelier.\n\nDuring the reign of Akbar (1556—1605), the number of painters grew from around 30 during the creation of the \"Hamzanama\" in the mid-1560s, to around 130 by the mid 1590s. According to court historian Abu'l-Fazal, Akbar was hands-on in his interest of the arts, inspecting his painters regularly and rewarding the best. It is during this time that Persian artists were attracted to bringing their unique style to the empire. Indian elements were present in their works from the beginning, with the incorporation of local Indian flora and fauna that were otherwise absent from the traditional Persian style. The paintings of this time reflected the vibrancy and inclusion of Akbar's kingdom, with production of Persian miniatures, the Rajput paintings (including the Kangra school) and the Pahari style of Northern India. They also influenced the Company style watercolor paintings created during the British rule many years later.\n\nWith the death of Akbar, his son Jahangir (1605–1627) took the throne. He preferred each painter work on a single piece rather than the collaboration fostered during Akbar's time. This period marks the emergence of distinct individual styles, notably Bishan Das, Manohar Das, Abu al-Hasan, Govardhan, and Daulat. The \"Razmnama\" (Persian translation of the Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\") and an illustrated memoir of Jahangir, named \"Tuzuk-i Jahangiri\", were created under his rule. Jahangir was succeeded by Shah Jahan (1628–1658), whose most notable architectural contribution is the Taj Mahal. Paintings under his rule were more formal, featuring court scenes, in contrast to the personal styles from his predecessor's time. Aurangzeb (1658–1707), who held increasingly orthodox Sunni beliefs, forcibly took the throne from his father Shah Jahan. With a ban of music and painting in 1680, his reign saw the decline of Mughal patronage of the arts.\n\nMughal art influenced the Rajput, Pahari, Deccan, Kangra and various other local styles of art. \n\nIn South-Central India, during the late fifteenth century after the Middle kingdoms, the Bahmani sultanate disintegrated into the Deccan sultanates centered at Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmadnagar, Bidar, and Berar. They used vedic techniques of metal casting, stone carving, and painting, as well as a distinctive architectural style with the addition of citadels and tombs from Mughal architecture. For instance, the Baridi dynasty (1504–1619) of Bidar saw the invention of \"bidri\" ware, which was adopted from Vedic and Maurya period ashoka pillars of zinc mixed with copper, tin, and lead and inlaid with silver or brass, then covered with a mud paste containing sal ammoniac, which turned the base metal black, highlighting the color and sheen of the inlaid metal. Only after the Mughal conquest of Ahmadnagar in 1600 did the Persian influence patronized by the Turco-Mongol Mughals begin to affect Deccan art.\n\nBritish colonial rule had a great impact on Indian art. Old patrons of art became less wealthy and influential, and Western art more ubiquitous as the British Empire established schools of art in major cities, e.g. the Bombay Art Society in 1888. The Company style of paintings became common, created by Indian artists working for European patrons of the East India Company. The style was mainly Romanticized, with watercolor the primary medium used to convey soft textures and tones. By 1858, the British government took over the task of administration of India under the British Raj. The fusion of Indian traditions with European style at this time is evident from Raja Ravi Varma's oil paintings of sari-clad women in a graceful manner.\n\nWith the Swadeshi Movement gaining momentum by 1905, Indian artists attempted to resuscitate the cultural identities suppressed by the British, rejecting the Romanticized style of the Company paintings and the mannered work of Raja Ravi Varma and his followers. Thus was created what is known today as the Bengal School of Art, led by the reworked Asian styles (with an emphasis on Indian nationalism) of Abanindranath Tagore (1871—1951), who has been referred to as the father of Modern Indian art. Other artists of the Tagore family, such as Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) and Gaganendranath Tagore (1867–1938) as well as new artists of the early 20th century such as Amrita Sher-Gil (1913–1941) were responsible for introducing Avant-garde western styles into Indian Art. Many other artists like Jamini Roy and later S.H. Raza took inspiration from folk traditions. In 1944, K.C.S. Paniker founded the Progressive Painters' Association (PPA) thus giving rise to the \"madras movement\" in art.\n\nIn 1947, India became independent of British rule. A group of six artists - K. H. Ara, S. K. Bakre, H. A. Gade, M.F. Husain, S.H. Raza and Francis Newton Souza - founded the Bombay Progressive Artists' Group in the year 1952, to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Though the group was dissolved in 1956, it was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all India's major artists in the 1950s were associated with the group. Some of those who are well-known today are Bal Chabda, Manishi Dey, V. S. Gaitonde, Krishen Khanna, Ram Kumar, Tyeb Mehta, K. G. Subramanyan, A. Ramachandran, Devender Singh, Akbar Padamsee, John Wilkins, Himmat Shah and Manjit Bawa. Present-day Indian art is varied as it had been never before. Among the best-known artists of the newer generation include Bose Krishnamachari and Bikash Bhattacharya. Another prominent Pakistani modernist was Ismail Gulgee, who after about 1960 adopted an abstract idiom that combines aspects of Islamic calligraphy with an abstract expressionist (or gestural abstractionist) sensibility.\n\nPainting and sculpture remained important in the later half of the twentieth century, though in the work of leading artists such as Nalini Malani, Subodh Gupta, Narayanan Ramachandran, Vivan Sundaram, Jitish Kallat, they often found radical new directions. Bharti Dayal has chosen to handle the traditional Mithila painting in most contemporary way and created her own style through the exercises of her own imagination, they appear fresh and unusual.\n\nThe increase in discourse about Indian art, in English as well as vernacular Indian languages, changed the way art was perceived in the art schools. Critical approach became rigorous; critics like Geeta Kapur, R. Siva Kumar,Shivaji K. Panikkar, Ranjit Hoskote, amongst others, contributed to re-thinking contemporary art practice in India.\n\nThe year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the influential Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included Vivan Sundaram, Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh, Bhupen Khakhar, and Nalini Malani—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition “Place for People”—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian R. Siva Kumar's benchmark exhibition and related publication, A Contextual Modernism, restored the Santiniketan artists—Rabindranath Tagore, Nandalal Bose, Benode Behari Mukherjee, and Ramkinkar Baij—to their proper place as the originators of an indigenously achieved yet transcultural modernism in the 1930s, well before the Progressives composed their manifesto in the late 1940s. Of the Santiniketan artists, Siva Kumar observed that they “reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity.”\n\nThe idea of Contextual Modernism emerged in 1997 from R. Siva Kumar's as a postcolonial critical tool in the understanding of an alternative modernism in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.\n\nSeveral terms including Paul Gilroy's \"counter culture of modernity\" and Tani Barlow's \"Colonial modernity\" have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that 'Contextual Modernism' is a more suited term because “the colonial in \"colonial modernity\" does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan's artist teachers' refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms.”\n\nAccording to R. Siva Kumar \"The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism.\" He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming Nandalal Bose, Rabindranath Tagore, Ram Kinker Baij and Benode Behari Mukherjee under the Bengal School of Art was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. \"This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice\".\n\n\"Contextual Modernism\" in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in Architecture.\n\nThe first known sculpture in the Indian subcontinent is from the Indus Valley civilization (3300–1700 BC), found in sites at Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in modern-day Pakistan. These include the famous small bronze male dancer. However such figures in bronze and stone are rare and greatly outnumbered by pottery figurines and stone seals, often of animals or deities very finely depicted. After the collapse of the Indus Valley civilization there is little record of sculpture until the Buddhist era, apart from a hoard of copper figures of (somewhat controversially) c. 1500 BCE from Daimabad. Thus the great tradition of Indian monumental sculpture in stone appears to begin relatively late, with the reign of Ashoka from 270 to 232 BCE, and the Pillars of Ashoka he erected around India, carrying his edicts and topped by famous sculptures of animals, mostly lions, of which six survive. Large amounts of figurative sculpture, mostly in relief, survive from Early Buddhist pilgrimage stupas, above all Sanchi; these probably developed out of a tradition using wood. Indeed, wood continued to be the main sculptural and architectural medium in Kerala throughout all historic periods until recent decades.\n\nDuring the 2nd to 1st century BCE in far northern India, in the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara from what is now southern Afghanistan and northern Pakistan, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha's life and teachings. Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form before this time, but only through some of his symbols. This may be because Gandharan Buddhist sculpture in modern Afghanistan displays Greek and Persian artistic influence. Artistically, the Gandharan school of sculpture is said to have contributed wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, acanthus leaf decorations, etc.\n\nThe pink sandstone Hindu, Jain and Buddhist sculptures of Mathura from the 1st to 3rd centuries CE reflected both native Indian traditions and the Western influences received through the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara, and effectively established the basis for subsequent Indian religious sculpture. The style was developed and diffused through most of India under the Gupta Empire (c. 320-550) which remains a \"classical\" period for Indian sculpture, covering the earlier Ellora Caves, though the Elephanta Caves are probably slightly later. Later large scale sculpture remains almost exclusively religious, and generally rather conservative, often reverting to simple frontal standing poses for deities, though the attendant spirits such as apsaras and yakshi often have sensuously curving poses. Carving is often highly detailed, with an intricate backing behind the main figure in high relief. The celebrated lost wax bronzes of the Chola dynasty (c. 850–1250) from south India, many designed to be carried in processions, include the iconic form of Shiva as Nataraja, with the massive granite carvings of Mahabalipuram dating from the previous Pallava dynasty.\nThe Chola period is also remarkable for its sculptures and bronzes. Among the existing specimens in the various museums of the world and in the temples of South India may be seen many fine figures of Siva in various forms, Vishnu and his wife Lakshmi, Siva saints and many more.\n\nThe tradition and methods of Indian cliff painting gradually evolved throughout many thousands of years - there are multiple locations found with prehistoric art. The early caves included overhanging rock decorated with rock-cut art and the use of natural caves during the Mesolithic period (6000 BCE). Their use has continued in some areas into historic times. The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka are on the edge of the Deccan Plateau where deep erosion has left huge sandstone outcrops. The many caves and grottos found there contain primitive tools and decorative rock paintings that reflect the ancient tradition of human interaction with their landscape, an interaction that continues to this day.\n\nThe oldest surviving frescoes of the historical period have been preserved in the Ajanta Caves with Cave 10 having some from the 1st century CE, though the larger and more famous groups are from the 5th century. Despite climatic conditions that tend to work against the survival of older paintings, in total there are known more than 20 locations in India with paintings and traces of former paintings of ancient and early medieval times (up to the 8th to 10th centuries CE), although these are just a tiny fraction of what would have once existed. The most significant frescoes of the ancient and early medieval period are found in the Ajanta, Bagh, Ellora, and Sittanavasal caves, the last being Jain of the 7th-10th centuries. Although many show evidence of being by artists mainly used to decorating palaces, no early secular wall-paintings survive.\n\nThe Chola fresco paintings were discovered in 1931 within the circumambulatory passage of the Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, and are the first Chola specimens discovered. Researchers have discovered the technique used in these frescoes. A smooth batter of limestone mixture is applied over the stones, which took two to three days to set. Within that short span, such large paintings were painted with natural organic pigments. During the Nayak period the Chola paintings were painted over. The Chola frescoes lying underneath have an ardent spirit of saivism is expressed in them. They probably synchronised with the completion of the temple by Rajaraja Cholan the Great.\n\nKerala mural painting has well-preserved fresco or mural or wall painting in temple walls in Pundarikapuram, Ettumanoor and Aymanam and elsewhere.\n\nAlthough few Indian miniatures survive from before about 1000 CE, and some from the next few centuries, there was probably a considerable tradition. Those that survive are initially illustrations for Buddhist texts, later followed by Jain and Hindu equivalents, and the decline of Buddhist as well as the vulnerable support material of the palm-leaf manuscript probably explain the rarity of early examples.\n\nMughal painting in miniatures on paper developed very quickly in the late 16th century from the combined influence of the existing miniature tradition and artists trained in the Persian miniature tradition imported by the Mughal Emperor's court. New ingredients in the style were much greater realism, especially in portraits, and an interest in animals, plants and other aspects of the physical world.\n\nMiniatures either illustrated books or were single works for muraqqas or albums of painting and Islamic calligraphy. The style gradually spread in the next two centuries to influence painting on paper in both Muslim and Hindu princely courts, developing into a number of regional styles often called \"sub-Mughal\", including Kangra painting and Rajput painting, and finally Company painting, a hybrid watercolour style influenced by European art and largely patronized by the people of the British raj. From the 19th century Western-style easel paintings became increasingly painted by Indian artists trained in Government art schools.\n\nThe Indian subcontinent has the longest continuous legacy of jewellery-making, with a history of over 5,000 years. Using jewellery as a store of capital remains more common in India than in most modern societies, and gold appears always to have been strongly preferred for the metal. India and the surrounding areas were important sources of high-quality gemstones, and the jewellery of the ruling class is typified by using them lavishly. One of the first to start jewellery-making were the people of the Indus Valley Civilization. Early remains are few, as they were not buried with their owners.\n\nWood was undoubtedly extremely important, but rarely survives long in the Indian climate. Organic animal materials such as ivory or bone were discouraged by the Dharmic religions, although Buddhist examples exist, such as the Begram ivories, many of Indian manufacture, but found in Afghanistan, and some relatively modern carved tusks. In Muslim settings they are more common.\n\nObscurity shrouds the period between the decline of the Harappans and the definite historic period starting with the Mauryas, and in the historical period, the earliest Indian religion to inspire major artistic monuments was Buddhism. Though there may have been earlier structures in wood that have been transformed into stone structures, there are no physical evidences for these except textual references. Soon after the Buddhists initiated rock-cut caves, Hindus and Jains started to imitate them at Badami, Aihole, Ellora, Salsette, Elephanta, Aurangabad and Mamallapuram and Mughals. It appears to be a constant in Indian art that the different religions shared a very similar artistic style at any particular period and place, though naturally adapting the iconography to match the religion commissioning them. Probably the same groups of artists worked for the different religions regardless of their own affiliations.\nBuddhist art first developed during the Gandhara period and Amaravati Periods around the 1st century BCE. It flourished greatly during the Gupta Periods and Pala Periods that comprise the Golden Age of India. Although the most glorious art of these Indian empires was mostly Buddhist in nature, subsequently Hindu Empires like the Pallava, Chola, Hoysala and Vijayanagara Empires developed their own styles of Hindu art as well.\n\nThere is no time line that divides the creation of rock-cut temples and free-standing temples built with cut stone as they developed in parallel. The building of free-standing structures began in the 5th century, while rock-cut temples continued to be excavated until the 12th century. An example of a free-standing structural temple is the Shore Temple, a part of the Mahabalipuram World Heritage Site, with its slender tower, built on the shore of the Bay of Bengal with finely carved granite rocks cut like bricks and dating from the 8th century.\n\nFolk and tribal art in India takes on different manifestations through varied media such as pottery, painting, metalwork, paper-art, weaving and designing of objects such as jewellery and toys. These are not just aesthetic objects but in fact have an important significance in people's lives and are tied to their beliefs and rituals. The objects can range from sculpture, masks (used in rituals and ceremonies), paintings, textiles, baskets, kitchen objects, arms and weapons, and the human body itself (tattoos and piercings). There is a deep symbolic meaning that is attached to not only the objects themselves but also the materials and techniques used to produce them.\n\nOften puranic gods and legends are transformed into contemporary forms and familiar images. Fairs, festivals, local heroes (mostly warriors) and local deities play a vital role in these arts (Example: Nakashi art from Telangana or Cherial Scroll Painting).\n\nFolk art also includes the visual expressions of the wandering nomads. This is the art of people who are exposed to changing landscapes as they travel over the valleys and highlands of India. They carry with them the experiences and memories of different spaces and their art consists of the transient and dynamic pattern of life. The rural, tribal and arts of the nomads constitute the matrix of folk expression. Examples of folk arts are Warli, Madhubani Art, Manjusha Art, Tikuli Art and Gond etc.\n\nWhile most tribes and traditional folk artist communities are assimilated into the familiar kind of civilised life, they still continue to practice their art. Unfortunately though, market and economic forces have ensured that the numbers of these artists are dwindling. A lot of effort is being made by various NGOs and the Government of India to preserve and protect these arts and to promote them. Several scholars in India and across the world have studied these arts and some valuable scholarship is available on them.\n\nThe folk spirit has a tremendous role to play in the development of art and in the overall consciousness of indigenous cultures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Piety is normally referred to as Taqwa in the Arabic language, which is derived from the root ‘waqaya,’ meaning ‘to safeguard’ or ‘to abstain.’ In Islamic terminology, this is defined as the act of restraining oneself from disobeying the commands of Allah. Pious acts of self-restraint or self-control, wherein an individual abstains from committing a sin, are believed to bestow virtue upon that individual. These acts of abstinence are considered the result of the individual's overall capability for self-restraint. No single act itself constitutes piety; piety describes possessing the power of self-control. Allah tells us in Quran that he does not differentiate between people expect on \"taqwa.\"\n\nPiety has been defined in various ways by different people and among whom are as follow:\nAlso other define it as thus:\nin another place he define piety as thus: \"Piety is that Allah does not miss you in the place where He has commanded you to be,and does not see (find) you where He has forbidden you from.\" \n\n"}

It is made in the form of a short biographical account of the life of the medieval Tuscan condottiere, Castruccio Castracani, who lived in and ruled Lucca.\n\nThe book is thought to have been written during a visit to Lucca in 1520. It was dedicated to Zanobi Buondelmonti and Luigi Alamanni. The former was also one of the two men to whom the \"Discourses on Livy\" was dedicated. Both, along with Machiavelli, are considered members of the so-called Orti Oricellari group.\n\nDespite being in the form of a biography the sayings of Castracani are generally considered to have been fabricated by Machiavelli. It is therefore sometimes compared to his more well-known works including \"The Prince\", the \"Discourses on Livy\", and the \"Art of War\".\n\nA distinct section of sayings appears at the end of the work, after Castracani's life has ended. Leo Strauss, in 1958, analyzed the various speeches attributed to Castracani in this work and found that they had mostly come from classical Roman and Greek sources, including most significantly several that had been attributed to Democritus by Diogenes Laertius.\n\nMachiavelli treats Castracani as a person whose aim was to unite Tuscany, but who failed because, as Machiavelli has the dying Castracani tell his heir \"Fortune, who is admitted to be arbiter of all human things, did not give me so much judgement that I could early understand her, nor so much time that I could overcome her\". This proposal that leaders can overcome the arbiter of all things is a common theme in Machiavelli's better known political works such as \"The Prince\".\n\nBy treating Castracani as a founder, almost, of a new state, Machiavelli used him as an example of the most important type of prince according to his other writings. In fact Machiavelli opens with a passage that treats prophets as the highest type of secular prince.\n\nCastracani was found as a baby left in a field, Machiavelli reports.\n\nMachiavelli ends by touching upon another theme found in his other works, which is that Italy in his time was weak.\n\n"}
{"id": "9914431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9914431", "title": "Linux gaming", "text": "Linux gaming\n\nLinux gaming refers to playing and developing video games for the Linux operating system, involving a Linux kernel–based operating system, often used for all computing tasks like surfing the web, office applications, desktop publishing, but also for gaming.\n\nLinux gaming started largely as an extension of the already present Unix gaming scene, with both systems sharing many similar titles. These games were either mostly original or clones of arcade games and text adventures. A notable example of this was the so-called \"BSD Games\", a collection of interactive fiction titles. The free software and open source methodologies which spawned the development of the operating system in general also spawned the creation of various early free games. Popular early titles included \"NetHack, Netrek, XBill, XEvil, xbattle, Xconq\" and \"XPilot\". As the operating system itself grew and expanded, the amount of free and open-source games also increased in scale and complexity.\n\nThe beginning of Linux as a gaming platform for commercial video games is widely credited to have begun in 1994 when Dave D. Taylor ported the game \"Doom\" to Linux, as well as many other systems, during his spare time. From there he would also help found the development studio \"Crack dot Com\", which released the video game\" Abuse\", with the game's Linux port even being published by Linux vendor Red Hat. id Software, the original developers of \"Doom\", also continued to release their products for Linux. Their game \"Quake\" was ported to Linux in 1996, once again by Dave D. Taylor working in his free time. Later id products continued to be ported by David Kirsch and Timothee Besset, a practice that continued until the studio's acquisition by ZeniMax Media in 2009. In 1991 DUX Software contracted Don Hopkins to port \"SimCity\" to Unix, which he later ported to Linux and eventually released as open source for the OLPC XO Laptop. Other early commercial Linux games included \"Hopkins FBI\", an adventure game released in 1998 by MP Entertainment, and \"Inner Worlds\" in 1996, which was released for and developed on Linux. In 1998, two programmers from Origin ported \"Ultima Online\" to Linux. A website called The Linux Game Tome began to catalog games created for or ported to Linux in 1995.\n\nOn November 9, 1998 a new software firm called Loki Software was founded by Scott Draeker, a former lawyer who became interested in porting games to Linux after being introduced to the system through his work as a software licensing attorney. Loki, although a commercial failure, is credited with the birth of the modern Linux game industry. Loki developed several free software tools, such as the Loki installer (also known as Loki Setup), and supported the development of the Simple DirectMedia Layer, as well as starting the OpenAL audio library project. These are still often credited as being the cornerstones of Linux game development. They were also responsible for bringing nineteen high-profile games to the platform before its closure in 2002. Loki's initial success also attracted other firms to invest in the Linux gaming market, such as Tribsoft, Hyperion Entertainment, Macmillan Digital Publishing USA, Titan Computer, Xatrix Entertainment Philos Laboratories, and Vicarious Visions. During this time Michael Simms founded Tux Games, one of the first online Linux game retailers.\n\nAfter Loki's closure, the Linux game market experienced some changes. Although some new firms, such as Linux Game Publishing and RuneSoft, would largely continue the role of a standard porting house, the focus began to change with Linux game proponents encouraging game developers to port their game products themselves or through individual contractors. Influential to this was Ryan C. Gordon, a former Loki employee who would over the next decade port several game titles to multiple platforms, including Linux. Around this time many companies, starting with id Software, also began to release legacy source code leading to a proliferation of source ports of older games to Linux and other systems. This also helped expand the already existing free and open-source gaming scene, especially with regards to the creation of free first person shooters.\n\nThe Linux gaming market also started to experience some growth towards the end of the decade with the rise of independent video game development, with many \"indie\" developers favouring support for multiple platforms. The Humble Indie Bundle initiatives helped to formally demonstrate this trend, with Linux users representing a sizable population of their purchase base, as well as consistently being the most financially generous in terms of actual money spent. The release of a Linux version of Desura, a digital distribution platform with a primary focus on small independent developers, was also heralded by several commentators as an important step to greater acknowledgement of Linux as a gaming platform. In 2009, the small indie game company Entourev LLC published Voltley to Linux which is the first commercial exclusive game for this operating system. In the same year, LGP released Shadowgrounds which was the first commercial game for Linux using the Nvidia PhysX middleware.\n\nIn July 2012, game developer and content distributor Valve Software announced a port of their Source engine for Linux as well as stating their intention to release their Steam digital distribution service for Linux. The potential availability of a Linux Steam client has already attracted other developers to consider porting their titles to Linux, including previously Mac OS only porting houses such as Aspyr Media and Feral Interactive.\n\nIn November 2012, Unity Technologies ported their Unity engine and game creation system to Linux starting with version 4. All of the games created with the Unity engine can now be ported to Linux easily.\n\nIn September 2013 Valve announced that they were releasing a gaming oriented Linux based operating system called \"SteamOS\" with Valve saying they had \"come to the conclusion that the environment best suited to delivering value to customers is an operating system built around Steam itself.\"\n\nIn March 2014 GOG.com announced they would begin to support Linux titles on their DRM free store starting the same year, after previously stating they would not be able due to too many distributions. GOG.com began their initial roll out on July 24, 2014 by offering 50 Linux supporting titles, including several new to the platform.\n\nIn March and April 2014 two major developers Epic Games and Crytek announced Linux support for their next generation engines Unreal Engine 4 and CryEngine respectively.\n\nOn 22 August 2018, Valve released their fork of Wine called Proton, aimed at gaming. It features some improvements over the vanilla Wine such as Vulkan-based DirectX 11 and 12 implementations, Steam integration, better full screen and game controller support and improved performance for multi-threaded games.\n\nMarket share can be estimated based on sales numbers, e. g. during Q2 2013, 79.3% of smartphones \"sold\" worldwide were running Android.\nWhen discussing free and open-source software, the term \"installed base\" seems rather popular. It is installation, not embedment or pre-installation, that tailors a product to the owner's personal needs. Unfortunately, installed base, as opposed to market share, proves to be a tricky thing to gauge.\n\nSurveys conducted by software such as Ubuntu Software Center or Steam can only tell about the \"installed base\" of a particular program or version or hardware, only on the machines on which the digital distribution software is already installed.\n\nIn 2010, in the first Humble Bundle sales, Linux accounted for 18%.\nThe Steam client tracks usage and reported in March 2014 that less than 1.2% of users are using some form of Linux as their platforms primary operating system, in May 2015 it was below 1%. The Unity game engine gathers user statistics and showed in that March 2016 Linux users accounted for 0.4% of players.\n\nLinux as a gaming platform can also refer to operating systems based on the Linux kernel and specifically designed for the \"sole purpose\" of gaming. Examples are SteamOS, which is an operating system for Steam Machines and computers, video game consoles built from components found in the classical home computer, (embedded) operating systems like Tizen and Pandora, and handheld game consoles like GP2X, and Neo Geo X. The Nvidia Shield runs Android as an operating system, which is based on a modified Linux kernel.\n\nThe open source design of the Linux software platform allows the operating system to be compatible with various computer instruction sets and many peripherals, such as game controllers and head-mounted displays. As an example, HTC Vive, which is a virtual reality head-mounted display, supports the Linux gaming platform.\n\nIn 2013, tests by Phoronix showed real-world performance of games on Linux with proprietary Nvidia and AMD drivers were mostly comparable to results on Windows 8.1. Phoronix found similar results in 2015, though Ars Technica described a 20% performance drop with Linux drivers.\n\nAn operating system based on the Linux kernel and customized specifically for gaming, could adopt the vanilla Linux kernel with only little changes, or—like the Android operating system—be based on a relative extensively modified Linux kernel. It could adopt GNU C Library or Bionic or something like it. The entire middleware or parts of it, could very well be closed-source and proprietary software; the same is true for the video games. There are free and open-source video games available for the Linux operating system, as well as proprietary ones.\n\nThe subsystems already mainlined and available in the Linux kernel are most probably performant enough so to not impede the gaming experience in any way, however additional software is available, such as e.g. the Brain Fuck Scheduler (a process scheduler) or the Budget Fair Queueing (BFQ) scheduler (an I/O scheduler).\n\nSimilar to the way the Linux kernel can be, for example, adapted to run better on supercomputers, there are adaptations targeted at improving the performance of games. A project concerning itself with this issue is called Liquorix.\n\nSeveral game development tools have been available for Linux, including GNU Debugger, LLDB, Valgrind, glslang and others. VOGL, a debugger for OpenGL was released on . See also Game Editor, APITrace and GtkRadiant. AMD CodeXL. An open-source, cross-platform clone of Enterbrain's RPG Maker (2000, 2003, XP, VX), called OpenRPG Maker, is currently in development.\n\nThere are a couple of interfaces and Software Development Kits available for Linux, almost all of them are cross-platform. Most are free and open-source software subject to the terms of the zlib License, making it possible to static link against them from fully closed-source proprietary software. One difficulty due to this abundance of interfaces, is the difficulty for programmers to choose the best suitable audio API for their purpose. The main developer of the PulseAudio project, Lennart Poettering, commented on this issue.\nPhysics engines, audio libraries, that are available as modules for game engines, have been available for Linux for a long time.\n\nThe book \"Programming Linux Games\" covers a couple of the available APIs suited for video game development for Linux, while \"The Linux Programming Interface\" covers the Linux kernel interfaces in much greater detail.\n\nBeside majority of the software which acts as an interface to various subsystems of the operating system, there is also software which can be simply described as middleware. A multitude of companies exist worldwide, whose main or only product is software that is meant to be licensed and integrated into a game engine. Their primary target is the video game industry, but the film industry also utilizes such software for special effects. Some very few well known examples are\nA significant share of the available middleware already runs natively on Linux, only a very few run exclusively on Linux.\n\nNumerous source code editors and IDEs are available for Linux, among which are Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, , Qt Creator, Emacs, or Vim.\n\nA multi-monitor setup is supported on Linux at least by AMD Eyefinity & AMD Catalyst, Xinerama and RandR on both X11 and Wayland. \"\" is one example of a game that runs natively on Linux and supports very high resolutions and is validated by AMD to support their Eyefinity. \"Civilization V\" is another example, it even runs on a \"Kaveri\" desktop APU in 3x1 portrait mode.\n\nThe specifications of the Mumble protocol are freely available and there are BSD-licensed implementations for both servers and clients. The positional audio API of Mumble is supported by e.g. \"\".\n\nWine is a compatibility layer that provides binary compatibility and makes it possible to run software, that was written and compiled for Microsoft Windows, on Linux. The Wine project hosts a user-submitted application database (known as Wine AppDB) that lists programs and games along with ratings and reviews which detail how well they run with Wine. Wine AppDB also has a commenting system, which often includes instructions on how to modify a system to run a certain game which cannot run on a normal or default configuration. Many games are rated as running flawlessly, and there are also many other games that can be run with varying degrees of success. The use of Wine for gaming has proved controversial in the Linux community as some feel it is preventing, or at least hindering, the further growth of native gaming on the platform.\n\nThere are numerous emulators for Linux. There are also APIs, virtual machines, and machine emulators that provide binary compatibility:\n\nLinux has been ported to several game consoles, including the Xbox, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, GameCube, and Wii which allows game developers without an expensive game development kit to access console hardware. Several gaming peripherals also work with Linux.\n\nThe game engine is the software solely responsible for the \"game mechanics\", or rules defining game play. There are different game engines for first-person shooters, strategy video games, etc. Besides the game mechanics, software is also needed to handle graphics, audio, physics, input handling, and networking.\n\nGame engines that are used by many video games and run on top of Linux include:\n\n\nThere are many free and open-source video games as well as commercially distributed proprietary video games that run natively on Linux. Some independent companies have also begun porting prominent video games from Microsoft Windows to Linux.\n\nA few original open source video games have attained notability:\nThere are a larger number of open source clones and remakes of classic games:\n\nValve officially released Steam for Linux on February 14, 2013. the number of Linux-compatible games on Steam exceeds 2,000. With the launch of SteamOS, a distribution of Linux made by Valve intended to be used for HTPC gaming, that number is quickly growing.

Several game titles that were previously released for Linux were also able to be expanded or updated because of the availability of game code, including \"Doom\", \"Abuse\", \"Quake\", \"Quake II\", \"Quake III Arena\" and \"Jagged Alliance 2\". Some derivatives based on released source code have also been released for Linux, such as \"Aleph One\" and \"Micropolis\" for \"\" and \"SimCity\" respectively.\n\nCertain game titles were even able to be ported due to availability of shared engine code even though the game's code itself remains proprietary or otherwise unavailable, such as the video game \"\" or the multiplayer component of \"\". Some games have even been ported entirely or partially by reverse engineering and game engine recreation such as \"WarCraft II\" through \"Wargus\" or \"Commander Keen\". Another trick is to attempt hacking the game to work as a mod on another native title, such as with the original \"Unreal\". Additionally, some games can be run through the use of Linux specific runtime environments, such as the case of certain games made with Adventure Game Studio such as the \"Chzo Mythos\" or certain titles made with the RPG Maker tool. Games derived from released code, with both free and proprietary media, that are released for Linux include \"Urban Terror\", \"OpenArena\", \"FreeDoom\", \"World of Padman\", \"Nexuiz/Xonotic\", \"War§ow\" and \"\".\n\nThis is a selected list of MMORPGs that are native on Linux:\n"}

She became deputy director of excavations at Maiden Castle in 1936 alongside Mortimer Wheeler, following the death of Tessa Wheeler. She undertook excavations on the defences of Silchester from 1938-9. Cotton worked at the Ministry of Economic Warfare during World War II and received the OBE in 1945. In 1949 she co-directed excavations at Verulamium alongside Mortimer Wheeler and excavated at Clausentum from 1951-54.\n\nIn the 1960s Cotton became closely involved in the work of the British School at Rome. She was the field director of the first 'scientific' excavations of a Republican villa in Italy, directed by John Bryan Ward-Perkins and Peter von Blanckenhagen, \"but essentially the project was hers\". The excavations at Posto and San Rocco (1962–65) were fully published. From 1965, Cotton was resident in Rome, and ran the archaeological work room of the British School at Rome, including work on the finds from the cemetery of Quattro Fontanili at Veii, Monte Irsi, Basilicata (1970) and Tuscania (1972-73).\n\nIn her later years, Cotton continued to work on Latian archaeology, whilst continuing to attend conferences.

{"id": "3091269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3091269", "title": "Mummies Alive!", "text": "Mummies Alive!\n\nMummies Alive! is a Canadian-American animated series from DIC Entertainment and Northern Lights Entertainment. It originally aired for one season in 1997.\n\nIn ancient Egypt, an evil sorcerer named Scarab kills the pharaoh's son, Prince Rapses, to become immortal. Entombed alive for his crime (Rapses' body was also never found), Scarab revives in the modern world and begins his search for Rapses' reincarnation, a San Francisco-dwelling boy named Presley Carnovan, to retrieve the spirit of Rapses so he can become immortal. Rapses' (Presley's) bodyguards, Ja-Kal, Rath, Armon, and Nefer-Tina, along with Rapses' cat, Kahti, awake from the dead to protect him from Scarab. They use the power of Ra to transform into powerful guardians.\n\nEach of the mummies is aligned with the power of an Egyptian god. Ja-Kal uses the spirit of falcon, Rath uses the spirit of snake, Armon uses the spirit of ram, and Nefer-Tina uses the spirit of cat. They are able to call upon it for magical armor and powers to fight superhuman evildoers. Although, once their strength is exhausted, they must rest in their sarcophagi to regain the ability. In order to access these powers, the mummies call out the phrase \"With the Strength of Ra!\", which triggers their transformation. The mummies also have the power to make a horrifying face, usually used to scare away nosy bystanders.\n\nIn addition to Scarab, the mummies often had to contend with gods and spirits from Egyptian myth summoned to the modern world, including Anubis, Set, Geb, Apep, Bast, Sekhmet, Bes, and many others, usually as part of one of Scarab's schemes that went out of his control.\n\nOriginally, \"Mummies Alive\" was geared towards an older audience, but during production it became predominately a children's show. The series ran for one season of 42 episodes; the last two episodes link together to end the show, as it appears episodes 38–40 were the finale of the first season. A second season was planned, but due to low ratings, it was canceled.\n\nEric and Julia Lewald, writers/producers for \"Mummies Alive!\", were also head writers for the third season of the \"Gargoyles\" animated series, and programs share common plot elements, including a group of warriors from the past that awaken in the present to fight a wealthy, immortality-obsessed enemy; their initial difficulties in adapting to the modern world; the use of mythological figures in numerous episodes; and a recurring femme fatale antagonist. These similarities made \"Mummies Alive!\" vulnerable to criticism describing it as little more than a \"Gargoyles\" clone.\n\nAfter its first and only season, repeats of \"Mummies Alive!\" continued to air on local stations across the country. The series previously aired every Sunday on Cookie Jar Toons on This TV.\n\nIn India, the show was dubbed into Tamil and Malayalam and aired on Sun TV and Amrita TV in the early 2000s, becoming popular in South India.\n\nPresley Carnovan – voiced by Bill Switzer\nA 12-year-old boy who has the spirit of Prince Rapses XII (an ancient pharaoh) who is based on Ramses. He soon discovers this when the Mummies introduce themselves as his guardians. He lives in San Francisco with his mother. He is reluctant to accept his role as Rapses, but on at least two occasions where he had the chance to be freed of his role, when Rapses's father apparently came through the Western Gate and when the original Rapses was drawn into the present, he expressed reluctance at losing his status as 'pharaoh' because it would have also meant him losing the mummies.\n\n\nAmanda Carnovan – voiced by Louise Vallance\nPresley's mother. She works at the City Museum. In \"Ghouls' Gold\", Armon refers to her as \"the wise Amanda\" when recalling advice she gave Presley. She has insecure feelings that Presley misses being with his father, who is away on business, and tries to bond with her son often.\n\nJa-Kal – voiced by Dale Wilson\nThe leader of the Mummies. In his transformed state, his armor resembles a falcon and also allows him to fly. His weapon is his razor sharp talons/claws and a bow that can shoot out flaming arrows. In ancient Egypt, Ja-Kal was a hunter who had a wife named Tia and a small baby son named Padjet; he died without knowing what happened to his family. He worries the most of Presley's safety, often acting as a father-figure to him. He commonly uses hunting terms to talk to others and explain situations. Ja-Kal commonly cares for other people's needs first and himself second. It was revealed in episode 39 that he had a brother, Arakh, who was a notorious bandit.\n\nRath – voiced by Scott McNeil\nThe most intelligent of the Mummies (but also the most arrogant), and also the only one able to cast spells. When he transforms, a green snake which turns into a golden cobra wraps around him and serves as his armor. His weapon of choice is a sword that can transform into a snake, but he is also able to perform magical incantations. He also designed and built the Mummies' vehicles. In the past, he served as the young Prince's tutor. He claims to know about science, but his definition is such things as turning a staff into a serpent, although he has learned to adapt some spells to the present (such as a spell that summoned underground snakes to bind his enemies in the past, but now summons electric cables in the present). Though they are enemies, Scarab does respect him for his spellcasting skills.\n\nArmon – voiced by Graeme Kingston\nArmon is huge and eats very often. He is very strong even when he has not transformed. He is missing his right arm and when he transforms he obtains a golden arm that is used as his weapon. His armor resembles a ram. In \"Ghouls' Gold\", it was explained that Armon lost his real arm fighting in the Pharaoh's army. The pharaoh then gave him his golden arm. While not fighting, Armon spends most of his time eating or watching 'the magic box' TV that Presley gave them. In the past, Armon was Rapses' teacher of combat.\n\nNefer-Tina – voiced by Cree Summer\nShe is the only female of the Mummies. She is an expert with her whip, has great agility, and is extremely proficient at driving the Hot-Ra — the Mummies' dragster-like vehicle. When she transforms, her armor is like a cat. Back in ancient Egypt, she had to hide the fact that she was a girl with a head piece or she would not have been allowed to drive chariots. She was known to everyone as Nefer. Only Prince Rapses knew her true identity during that period of time. Ja-Kal and the other members were shocked to find out about the revelation. Armon then comments \"No wonder he never went swimming in the Nile with us\". Out of the group, she is the only one who is absolutely willing to try anything modern, such as driving a car, and constantly learns under Presley. She also travels the modern world in disguise to try new things. Nefer-Tina's name was based on Queen Nefertiti.\n\nScarab – voiced by Gerard Plunkett\nThe Pharaoh's adviser, who later sucked the life force from Prince Rapses for youth and immortality. However the effects were not permanent and started to wear off after a few centuries. Now with Prince Rapses reincarnated as Presley Carnovan, he will stop at nothing to steal the prince's life force again. When Scarab transforms, his body is covered in golden and purple armor, resembling that of a scarab beetle and possessing the power of flight. He also possesses a magical talking snake named Heka that acts as his magical staff from time to time, much to her dismay. His powers include shooting energy blasts from his hands, the creation of Shabti and extensive knowledge in summoning creatures from the afterlife in ancient Egypt. However, he has also shown a good grasp of modern technology, as shown most keenly in \"Sleight of Hand\", where he used technology while competing against the mummies in a mystical contest to try to become Presley's 'guardian' himself (Although Ja-Kal and Presley were able to expose the deception at the last minute).\n\nThe identity Scarab takes when he needs to be in public. Harris Stone is known as a wealthy individual. As a major benefactor for the Museum, he gives a speech in \"Who's Who\" that is one to remember. Even though he is trying to kill Rapses, Scarab feels responsible for the Egyptian artifacts of the museum and feels a degree of sadness when they are damaged. He is also quick to offer money to people who oppose his point of view. Scarab killed the real Harris Stone when he discovered his crypt and inadvertedly freed him, and took over his identity.\n\nThe Snake Familiar, and sometimes Staff, of Scarab. She acts as his loyal companion and advisory, who often makes snide, sarcastic remarks and witty observations. She also has the ability to spit fire.\n\nPrince Rapses' father, the Pharaoh and ruler of all of Egypt. He was a good Pharaoh and was very respected by all his people. He appears in Scarab and Presley's dreams in \"Pack to the Future\". In \"Reunion\", Scarab makes the Mummies believe that Amenhotep has returned. In \"Family Feud I – Brother's Keeper\", Amenhotep appears in some of Ja-Kal's recollections.\n\nScarab's dog-like pet. He has the head of a crocodile, the body of a lion and the hindquarters of a hippopotamus. Presley describes him in Pack to the Future as \"That's the ugliest dog I've ever seen.\" Ammut was not summoned by Scarab but simply tagged along with the Pack, and then stuck around -he usually messes up anything Scarab tells him to do. Ammut has good parts in \"Pack to the Future\" and \"Who's Who\". In Egyptian Mythology, Ammut is female.\n\nSerpent of the Desert. An anthropomorph cobra-like creature with an ability to change shape into a young human man. Rapses' grandfather drove Apep out of Egypt and into the desert 3500 years ago. Apep is after revenge and wants Rapses to pay for what his grandfather did to him and when Scarab summons him and his gang, they take on the shapes of a motorbiker gang. However, upon meeting and fighting Nefer-Tina, he falls in love with her and decides to disobey Scarab. Apep appears in \"Desert Chic\" and \"Pepped With Good Intention\".\n\nArakh is Ja-Kal's evil brother and was known as the \"Scorpion of the Desert\". He can transform into his Scorpion armor. His story is told in the three \"Family Feud\" episodes.\n\nCat Goddess of ancient Egypt and the patron goddess of Nefer-Tina, brought to the present in \"Paws\". She demands to be worshiped by the people.\n\nMaster of Chance and Trickery. He is a small mischievous green dwarf who enjoys playing games on people. He especially enjoys flipping a coin to decide on outcomes quite similar to Batman's Two-Face. Bes appears in \"Who's Who\" and \"Tree O'Clock Rock\".\n\nRath's student of magic 3500 years ago. She was the best student he ever had, and she became more powerful than Rath. Rath was falling in love with her, but had to stop teaching Chontra when the pharaoh ordered him to teach Prince Rapses. For that, Chontra became vengeful and wants to make Rath pay. She gets her first chance in \"Good Bye Mr. Cheops\". She tries again in \"Tempting Offer\" and \"Eye of the Beholder\".\n\nHorrific monster trapped in a mirror. No one knows his origin. Every 3500 years, when the planets align, he seeks the soul of a Pharaoh so he can exchange himself with the spirit to free himself from the mirror. The Pharaoh's soul would then be lost until the planets realign in 3500 more years (A fact that allowed the Mummies to deduce that Scarab was not involved in its release as Scarab would want Presley's soul for himself). Once unleashed, no power on earth would be able to stop him. Only the one who sets the spell in motion can stop him. The Eye of Darkness makes its appearance in \"The Face in the Mirror\".\n\nSpirit of the Earth – a huge rock giant that makes earthquakes when he walks. He is a rather unintelligent giant that attacks anyone who disturbs him. Geb is first featured in \"The Gift of Geb\". Geb also has a major part in \"Monster Truck Mania\". It is revealed that he is married to Net, goddess of the sky, in \"Married to the Geb\".\n\nA headless and bodiless guy with just two arms who is a spirit that lives inside Scarab and comes out of his mouth. For an example, see \"Body Slam\". In ancient Egyptian religion, the Ka is the spirit of a man's soul and is represented by the symbol of two upright arms.\n\nThe sacred cat, sometimes called the sacred kitty. Kahti can transform into a bigger, more-powerful, lynx-sized cat. She was Prince Rapses' pet 3500 years ago, and occasionally serves as Presley's more 'immediate' guardian by staying near him when he is not with the other Mummies, her small size allowing her to escape being noticed.\n\nFriend of Nefer-Tina 3500 years ago. Enchantra appears as Kenna in \"Eye of the Beholder\".\n\nArakh's son and Ja-Kal's nephew. He might not truly be considered a bad guy, but does side with Scarab and cause the Mummies a lot of grief before he determines where his true allegiances lie. He also can transform into Scorpion armor like his father. Kimas appears in the second and third \"Family Feud\" episodes.\n\nA cloudlike being who can produce rain and lightning and can turn into a tornado. Geb and Net might be called your typical married couple. They have a little spat in \"Married to the Geb\". In mythology, Net is spelled as \"Nut\", however, she and Geb are spouses and siblings of each other.\n\nA powerful water-spirit occasionally summoned by Scarab for various schemes. He is self-important, irreverent, and has a morbid, yet slapstick sense of humor. Nuhn appears in \"High Nuhn\" and \"Water, Water, Everywhere\".\n\nAncient goddess of sickness and health. She has destroyed whole civilizations with her evil temper. Unlike in actual Egyptian depiction where she is a lion-headed goddess, she has the head of a vulture in this version. Nobody was ever able to defeat her. Sekhmet appears in \"The Curse of the Sekhmet\" when Scarab summons her to cure his cold - enraged at being summoned for such a trifle, she sets out to destroy the city and Scarab and Rath have to team up to banish her.\n\nSet is a bulldog-headed spirit who is leader of the \"Trackers of Souls\". He calls himself \"Dog of the Desert, Master of Evil, Lord of Thunder\". Anubis, the not-so-competent jackal (wild dog) spirit of the underworld, tags along with Set. Anubis has a scepter that causes \"the sleep of forgetting\". They appear in \"Pack to the Future\", \"The Face In The Mirror\", \"Dog Bites Mummy\", and \"Family Feud I – Brother's Keeper\". They are often summoned by Scarab, but occasionally did turn on him when they did not like to be ordered around. Unlike in real Egyptian mythology, where Anubis is a mostly neutral and clever god, he is one of the villains and is rather dim-witted, often being outsmarted by Presley. In Egyptian Mythology, Set doesn't have the head of a dog.\n\nGolem-like armies of men made of clay controlled by Scarab. They are very easy to defeat as they break into pieced when toppled, however usually there are quite many of them. They also shatter easily when hit and dissolve in water. They most often look like Egyptians, but can be dressed up as anything, such as construction workers or policemen. Sometimes, if they are broken in half, both halves can still function independently.\n\nBrought to life by Scarab. In natural form he is 100 feet tall, but can reduce his size. In \"Body Slam\", he reduces himself to about 10 feet tall and 500 pounds for the Tournament. Then in \"Miscast\", he is recreated by Rath. He comes back looking for a mate in \"Object of His Affections\". Talos is from Greek mythology. The human anklebone is called the \"Talus\".\n\nJa-Kal's wife 3500 years ago. They had a small baby son named Padjet. In \"Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian\", we see the scene of the last time Ja-Kal sees Tia and Padjet. Tia gives Ja-Kal an imprint of his son's hand. This hand print is now a sad memory for Ja-Kal of the family he once had. At the end of \"Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian\", Presley asks Ja-Kal, \"What happened to your family?\" Ja-Kal responds sadly with, \"I don't know.\" Presley then says, \"It was Rapses fault – my fault! I don't know how, but some day I'll make it up to you. I promise!\" Ja-Kal thinks about Tia and Padjet in \"Eye of the Beholder\" and Chontra appears as Tia.\n\nWorks as a Regional Subdirector for the Department of Federal Investigation. He analyzes Rath in \"We've Got One\".\n\nA clumsy, nerdy sales clerk who sells clothes but is allergic to wool. Nonetheless, he gets a kiss from Nefer-Tina in \"True Believer\".\n\nRotund police officer, and Joe Pendleton's partner.\n\nWalter's older sister. Presley has a crush on her, but she is a couple of years older than Presley and likes Benjamin who is in college. Cynthia usually cannot even remember Presley's name and calls him \"Preston\" or \"Wesley\".\n\nThe janitor at the City Museum. Murdoch is his dog. Charlie is an old navy man. He is really proud of the times when he met Mike Conners (Mannix) in '62. \"That was when me and Larry met Kojak.\" Charlie appears in \"Honey, I Shrunk the Mummies\".\n\nShe is a student in Presley's grade. She likes Presley, but often has a tough time getting his attention.\n\nJoe is a police officer, and the Regional Treasurer of the Third Annual Paranormal Alien Visitors Psychic Convention and Brat-Bust. He finally meets his first \"space alien\" in \"A Dark and Shrieky Night\" when Ja-Kal humors him by making it sound like he is from outer space. Joe and Bob both get deeply involved with the \"aliens\" in \"We've Got One\". They also appear briefly in many other episodes. Joe is featured in the final episode \"Show Me the Mummy!\".\n\nPresley's science teacher. Known as Mr. Huxley to his students, and considered to be a \"science geek\", he is someone who never has fun. He also believes there is an explanation for everything. He has starring roles in \"Good Bye Mr. Cheops\" and \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Huxley\". He also appears in \"Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian\", \"The Gift of Geb\", \"The Curse of the Sekhmet\", \"Missing Ja-Kal\", and \"Eye of the Beholder\".\n\nAmanda Carnovan's boss and the director of the Museum. He makes appearances in \"Ra, Ra, Ra, Ra\", \"Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian\", and \"Pack to the Future\".\n\nOwns the Java Spot cafe. Presley's mother spends some time with him in \"Tempting Offer\".\n\nPresley's father who lives in Memphis (presumably Presley's parents are divorced). His dad claims to be an archeologist, but his true activities are somewhat suspect. He visits Presley in \"My Dad the Hero\".\n\nAn expert but extremely bad and boring lecturer who discovered the scroll that can open the gates of time. His lecture takes place at the beginning of \"The Prince and the Presley\".\n\nHead of Federal Investigation and is Agent Phillips' boss.\n\nFour homeless street people who befriend Rath when he loses his memory in \"Dead Man Walking\".\n\nThe school bully. He and his punk friend Chuck like to rough up the other kids. Tiny and Chuck appear in \"The Egyp-Tsu Kid\" and briefly in \"Dog Bites Mummy\" and \"Kid Scarab\".\n\nCynthia's brother and Presley's friend who is in 7th grade with him.\n\nIn 1998, a VHS entitled \"Mummies Alive! – The Legend Begins\" was released. DVDs have also been released including \"Mummies Alive: The Beginning\" and two volume sets in 2007. In 2017, three volumes of double DVDs were released in Germany, with 14 episodes on each volume. The complete 42 episode series is available as of March 24, 2017, the release date of the third and final volume. The DVDs are region 2 with German, and English audio as well.\n\nTo coincide with the animated series, Hasbro produced a series of \"Mummies Alive!\" 5\" tall action figures and vehicles in 1997. There were regular and \"fright face\" varieties of the main mummies. Nefer-Tina and Presley got toys as well, but they are later releases and harder to find. A final wave of toys would have contained a Night Hunter Ja-Kal and Armon, as well as Cobra Strike Pep but only a few of these figures were released in some parts of Europe.\n\n"}
{"id": "7187536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7187536", "title": "Pact of Umar", "text": "Pact of Umar\n\nThe Pact of Umar (also known as the Covenant of Umar, Treaty of Umar or Laws of Umar; or or ), is an apocryphal treaty between the Muslims and the Christians of either Syria, Mesopotamia, or Jerusalem that later gained a canonical status in Islamic jurisprudence. It specifies rights and restrictions for non-Muslims (dhimmis) living under Islamic rule. \n\nThere are several versions of the pact, differing both in structure and stipulations. While the pact is traditionally attributed to the second Rashidun Caliph Umar ibn Khattab, other jurists and orientalists have doubted this attribution with the treaty being attributed to 9th century Mujtahids (Islamic scholars) or the Umayyad Caliph Umar II. This treaty should not be confused with Umar's Assurance of safety to the people of Aelia (known as \"al-ʿUhda al-ʿUmariyya\", ).\n\nIn general, the pact contains a list of rights and restrictions on non-Muslims (dhimmis). By abiding to them, non-Muslims are granted security of their persons, their families, and their possessions. Other rights and stipulations may also apply. According to Ibn Taymiyya, one of the jurists who accepted the authenticity of the pact, the dhimmis have the right \"to free themselves from the Covenant of 'Umar and claim equal status with the Muslims if they enlisted in the army of the state and fought alongside the Muslims in battle.\"\n\nAccording to Abu-Munshar, the historical origin of the document may lie in an agreement made between the Muslim conquerors and the Christians of Jazira or Damascus which was later extended to Dhimmis elsewhere. He further writes that, \"The humiliating conditions enumerated in the so-called “Pact of Umar” are utterly foreign to the mentality, thoughts and practices of this caliph...The deficiencies [in the textual integrity] support the contention that Umar was not the originator of the document.\"\nSome Western historians suggest that the document was based on Umar's Assurance, a treaty concluded between Umar ibn Khattab and the Patriarch of Jerusalem, Sophronius following the capture of Jerusalem by the Rashidun Caliphate (637), while others believe the document was either the work of 9th century Mujtahids or was forged during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph Umar II (717-720), with other clauses added later. Other scholars concluded that the document may have originated in immediate post-conquest milieu and was stylized by later historians.\n\nWestern scholars' opinions varied about the Pact's authenticity. According to Anver M. Emon, \"There is intense discussion in the secondary literature\" about the Pact's authenticity, With scholars disagreeing on whether it might have originated during the reign of Umar b. al-Khattab or was \"a later invention retroactively associated with Umar -- the caliph who famously led the initial imperial expansion -- to endow the contract of dhimma with greater normative weight?\" A.S. Tritton is one scholar who has \"suggested that the Pact is a fabrication\" because later Muslim conquerors did not apply its terms to their agreements with their non-Muslim subjects, which they would have if the pact had existed earlier. on the other hand Another scholar Daniel C. Dennet believes that the Pact was \"no different from any other treaty negotiated in that period and that it is well within reason that the Pact we have today , as preserved in al-Tabari's chronicle is an authentic version of that early treaty.\" Historian Abraham P. Bloch writes that, \"Omar was a tolerant ruler, unlikely to impose humiliating conditions upon non-Muslims, or to infringe upon their religious and social freedoms. His name has been erroneously associated…with the restrictive Covenant of Omar.\"\n\nAccording to Thomas Walker Arnold, the pact \"is in harmony\" with Umar's \"kindly consideration for his subjects of another faith,\n\n\"A later generation attributed to ‘Umar a number of restrictive regulations which hampered the Christians in the free exercise of their religion, but De Goeje and Caetani have proved without doubt that they are the invention of a later age; as, however, Muslim theologians of less tolerant periods accepted these ordinaces as genuine ...\n\nThe book \"Classical Islam: a Sourcebook of Religious Literature\", quotes a version of the Pact from \"Kitab al-Umm\" of al-Shafi'i (d.204/820) that it says may be \"a forerunner to the later document which gained something of a canonical status, making it applicable in many locations ...\"\n\nThere are several different versions of the pact that differ both in their language and stipulations. \n\nThe points:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3747686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3747686", "title": "Plains Indian Sign Language", "text": "Plains Indian Sign Language\n\nPlains Indian Sign Language (PISL), also known as Plains Sign Talk, Plains Sign Language and First Nation Sign Language, is a trade language (or international auxiliary language), formerly trade pidgin, that was once the lingua franca across central Canada, central and western United States and northern Mexico, used among the various Plains Nations. It was also used for story-telling, oratory, various ceremonies, and by deaf people for ordinary daily use. It is falsely believed to be a manually coded language or languages, however there is not substantive evidence establishing a connection between any spoken language and Plains Sign Talk.\n\nThe name 'Plains Sign Talk' is preferred in Canada, with 'Indian' being considered pejorative by many. Hence, publications and reports on the language vary in naming conventions according to origin.\n\nPlains Sign Talk's antecedents, if any, are unknown, due to lack of written records. But, the earliest records of contact between Europeans and Indigenous peoples of the Gulf Coast region in what is now Texas and northern Mexico note a fully formed sign language already in use by the time of the Europeans' arrival there. These records include the accounts of Cabeza de Vaca in 1527 and Coronado in 1541.\n\nAs a result of several factors, including the massive depopulation and the Americanization of Indigenous North Americans, the number of Plains Sign Talk speakers declined from European arrival onward. In 1885, it was estimated that there were over 110,000 \"sign-talking Indians\", including Blackfoot, Cheyenne, Sioux, Kiowa and Arapaho. By the 1960s, there remained a \"very small percentage of this number\". There are few Plains Sign Talk speakers today in the 21st century.\n\nWilliam Philo Clark, who served in the United States Army on the northern plains during the Indian Wars, was the author of \"The Indian Sign Language\", first published in 1885. \"The Indian Sign Language with Brief Explanatory Notes of the Gestures Taught Deaf-Mutes in Our Institutions and a Description of Some of the Peculiar Laws, Customs, Myths, Superstitions, Ways of Living, Codes of Peace and War Signs\" is a comprehensive lexicon of signs, with accompanying insights into indigenous cultures and histories. It remains in print.\n\nSign language use has been documented across speakers of at least 37 spoken languages in twelve families, spread across an area of over 2.6 million square kilometres (1 million square miles). In recent history, it was highly developed among the Crow, Cheyenne, Arapaho and Kiowa, among others, and remains strong among the Crow, Cheyenne and Arapaho.\n\nSigning may have started in the south, perhaps in northern Mexico or Texas, and only spread into the plains in recent times, though this suspicion may be an artifact of European observation. Plains Sign Talk spread to the Sauk, Fox, Potawatomi, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Caddo after their removal to Oklahoma. Via the Crow, it replaced the divergent Plateau Sign Language among the eastern nations that used it, the Coeur d'Alene, Sanpoil, Okanagan, Thompson, Lakes, Shuswap, and Coleville in British Columbia, with western nations shifting instead to Chinook Jargon.\n\nThe various nations with attested use, divided by language family, are:\nA distinct form is also reported from the Wyandot of Ohio.\n\nIt is known that Navajo has a comparably sizeable population of individuals who can speak the Navajo dialect of Plains Sign Talk. There is also an unrelated sign language, Navajo Family Sign, in a clan of Navajos that has several deaf members.\n\nThere exists a variety of Plains Sign Talk within the Blackfoot Confederacy. Little is known about the language beyond that it is used by Deaf community members, as well as by the community at large, to pass on \"oral\" traditions and stories.\n\nThere are four basic parameters of Plains Sign Talk: the location of the hand, its movement, shape, and orientation:\n\n\nThere may be other parameters, such as facial features. However, these function like suprasegmentals, and the four parameters listed above are the crucial ones.\n\nAlthough the parameters of sign are listed separately below, in actuality they co-occur with the other parameters to make a single sign. It is not clear how many of the differences were distinctive (phonemic).\n\nThe Bureau of American Ethnology published a glossary of Plains Sign Talk words that illustrates the handshapes involved. They assigned them alphabetic letters.\n\n\nPlains Sign Talk uses the following locations. The various neutral spaces are the most common places for signs to occur.\nThese are the directions towards which the palm can face.\n\n\nThe movements below are found in Plains Sign Talk. They may be repeated in certain situations.\n\nAs most Native American languages lacked an indigenous alphabetic tradition, and as Plains Indian Sign Language was widely understood among different tribes, a written, graphic transcription of these signs is known to have functioned as a medium of communication between Native Americans on and off reservations during the period of American colonization, removal, and forced schooling in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The letter of a Kiowa student, Belo Cozad, in 1890 sent to Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania from his parents on a reservation in Oklahoma made use of such signs and becomes one of the only known indigenous written transcriptions of the Kiowa language.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24388", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24388", "title": "Political science", "text": "Political science\n\nPolitical science is a social science which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of political activities, political thoughts, and political behavior. It deals extensively with the theory and practice of politics which is commonly thought of as determining of the distribution of power and resources. Political scientists \"see themselves engaged in revealing the relationships underlying political events and conditions, and from these revelations they attempt to construct general principles about the way the world of politics works.\"\n\nPolitical science -- occasionally called politicology -- comprises numerous subfields, including comparative politics, political economy, international relations, political theory, public administration, public policy, and political methodology. Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, geography, psychology/psychiatry, and anthropology.\n\nComparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of constitutions, political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective. International relations deals with the interaction between nation-states as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. Political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.\n\nPolitical science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in social research. Approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, behaviouralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralism. Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and model building.\n\nPolitical scientists study matters concerning the allocation and transfer of power in decision making, the roles and systems of governance including governments and international organizations, political behaviour and public policies. They measure the success of governance and specific policies by examining many factors, including stability, justice, material wealth, peace and public health. Some political scientists seek to advance positive (attempt to describe how things are, as opposed to how they should be) theses by analysing politics. Others advance normative theses, by making specific policy recommendations.\n\nPolitical scientists provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the electorate analyse issues. According to Chaturvedy,\nIn the United States, political scientists known as \"Americanists\" look at a variety of data including constitutional development, elections, public opinion, and public policy such as Social Security reform, foreign policy, US Congressional committees, and the US Supreme Court — to name only a few issues.\n\nBecause political science is essentially a study of human behaviour, in all aspects of politics, observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though experimental methods are increasingly common (see experimental political science). Citing this difficulty, former American Political Science Association President Lawrence Lowell once said \"We are limited by the impossibility of experiment. Politics is an observational, not an experimental science.\" Because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.\n\nLike all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in biology or inanimate objects as in physics. Despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.\n\nThe advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. In fact, the designation \"political scientist\" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a master's in the subject. Integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both normative and positive political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. The American Political Science Association and the \"American Political Science Review\" were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena. To date, the American Political Science Review is the leading journal in Political Science research. \n\nIn the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioural revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behaviour swept the discipline. A focus on studying political behaviour, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioural political science, including work by Robert Dahl, Philip Converse, and in the collaboration between sociologist Paul Lazarsfeld and public opinion scholar Bernard Berelson.\n\nThe late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a take off in the use of deductive, game theoretic formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. This period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the United States Congress, as well as political behaviour, such as voting. William H. Riker and his colleagues and students at the University of Rochester were the main proponents of this shift.\n\nDespite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.\n\nThe theory of political transitions, and the methods of their analysis and anticipating of crises, form an important part of political science. Several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions. Among them, a statistical indicator of crisis, simultaneous increase of variance and correlations in large groups, was proposed for crises anticipation and successfully used in various areas. Its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 Ukrainian economic and political crisis. There was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the Ukrainian society (by about 64%) and also in their statistical dispersion (by 29%) during the pre-crisis years. A feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted. The theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.\n\nIn the Soviet Union, political studies were carried out under the guise of some other disciplines like theory of state and law, area studies, international relations, studies of labor movement, \"critique of bourgeois theories\", etc. Soviet scholars were represented at the International Political Science Association (IPSA) since 1955 (since 1960 by the Soviet Association of Political and State Studies).\n\nIn 1979, the 11th World Congress of IPSA took place in Moscow. Until the late years of the Soviet Union, political science as a field was subjected to tight control of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and was thus subjected to distrust. Anti-communists accused political scientists of being \"false\" scientists and of having served the old regime.\n\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union, two of the major institutions dealing with political science, the Institute of Contemporary Social Theories and the Institute of International Affairs, were disbanded, and most of their members were left without jobs. These institutes were victims of the first wave of anticommunist opinion and ideological attacks. Today, the Russian Political Science Association unites professional political scientists from all around Russia.\n\nIn 2000, the Perestroika Movement in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. Those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.\n\nEvolutionary psychology theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. However, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in today's world. This is argued to explain many important features and systematic cognitive biases of current politics.\n\nPolitical science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, \"as a discipline lives on the fault line between the 'two cultures' in the academy, the sciences and the humanities.\" Thus, in some American colleges where there is no separate School\n\nMost United States colleges and universities offer B.A. programs in political science. M.A. or M.A.T. and Ph.D. or Ed.D. programs are common at larger universities. The term \"political science\" is more popular in North America than elsewhere; other institutions, especially those outside the United States, see political science as part of a broader discipline of \"political studies,\" \"politics,\" or \"government.\" While \"political science\" implies use of the scientific method, \"political studies\" implies a broader approach, although the naming of degree courses does not necessarily reflect their content. Separate degree granting programs in international relations and public policy are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Master's level programs in political science are common when political scientists engage in public administration.\n\nThe national honor society for college and university students of government and politics in the United States is Pi Sigma Alpha.\n\nMost political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:\n\nSome political science departments also classify methodology as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields. In the United States, American politics is often treated as a separate subfield.\n\nIn contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, political behaviour (including public opinion, collective action, and identity), and political institutions (including legislatures and international organizations). Political science conferences and journals often emphasize scholarship in more specific categories. The American Political Science Association, for example, has 42 organized sections that address various methods and topics of political inquiry.\nAs a social science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century. At that time it began to separate itself from political philosophy, which traces its roots back to the works of Aristotle, and Plato which were written nearly 2,500 years ago. The term \"political science\" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Clermont-Ganneau, followed by Macalister, identified the site with the tomb of the biblical matriarch Rachel based on the biblical text ().\n\nThe Israel Antiquities Authority survey gives the site the identification code Hizma, site number 480 in Benjamin, coordinates 17580 and 13880. Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied during the Middle Bronze Age. Excavation work was executed by Tzur Abeles, who published the results in 1997.\nThere were originally five structures, but one was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the Ramallah bypass road.\n\nLouis-Hugues Vincent researched the site and found five very large stone structures, between 10-53 metres long and 2.8-6.62 metres high, each with a funerary room in its centre. The rough-hewn stone blocks form rectangular walled structures. Vincent studied the building style and drew the conclusion that they were erected by Bronze Age nomadic shepherds, who would bring their dead back here and bury them inside the structures.\n\nVincent asked the local inhabitants for the name of the site, which he was told is \"Qubbur Bene Israin\", \"Tombs of the Sons of Israel\"; and of the largest structure, which they named as \"Qaber Um Bene Israin\", \"Tomb of the Mother of the Sons of Israel\".\n\nIt can be hypothesised from the name \"Qaber Um Bene Israin\", \"Tombs of the Mothers of the Sons of Israel\", that this is the tomb of Rachel (see ), or that there is a connection to the death and burial of the nurse Deborah \"below Bethel\" from , as well as to the passage about the oak of Tabor being near Rachel's tomb in 1 Samuel 10.\n\n\n"}

The American economist Adrian Augustus Holtz (1917:15) described how early German school reforms were \"carried on in a way that allowed for a religio-centric educational system.\" Sinclair Lewis's \"Main Street\" (1920:307) said, \"Maud Dyer was neurotic, religiocentric, faded; her emotions were moist, and her figure was unsystematic.\"\n\nThe related term \"Christocentric\" theologically means \"forms of Christianity that concentrate on the teaching of Jesus Christ\", but is sometimes used as a near synonym of \"religiocentric\". For instance (Hamilton 2002), \"No matter where it appears, government-sponsored Christocentrism, or even religiocentrism, undermines this nation's ideals.\"\n\nReligiocentrism is commonly discussed in contexts of psychology, sociology, and anthropology.\n\nThe Australian social psychologists John J. Ray and Dianne Doratis defined religiocentrism.\n\"Ethnocentrism\" is the social scientist's value-neutral term for ethnic or racial prejudice. It refers to ethnically-based sentiments of exclusiveness without any implication of their moral worth or justifiability... By analogy, the term religiocentrism is derived here to mean \"religiously\" based sentiments of exclusiveness—beliefs that one should marry within one's own religion, work with members of one's own religion, and in general prefer members of one's own religion above others. This will also entail \"ipso facto\" devaluative judgments of other religions. (1971:170)\n\nRay and Doratis designed a groundbreaking attitude scale to measure religiocentrism and ethnocentrism. Their religiocentrism scale comprises 33 items (for instance, \"I think my religion is nearer to the truth than any other\" and \"Most Moslems, Buddhists and Hindus are very stupid and ignorant\"), with five-point Likert scale psychometric response options from \"Strongly agree\" (Scored 5) to \"Strongly disagree\" (1). To verify internal consistency among respondents, 11 items were reverse scored (\"It makes no difference to me what religion my friends are\" is the converse of \"I think that it's better if you stick to friends of the same religion as your own\"), resulting in a reliability coefficient of .88 among 154 first-year university students. The authors tested attitudes among Australian fifth-form students in two Catholic and two public schools, and discovered that neither ethnocentrism nor religiocentrism showed any correlation with religious background. Ray and Doratis concluded (1971:178), \"Ethnocentrism, religiocentrism and religious conservatism were all shown to be separate and distinct factors of attitudes in their own right. They are not just three aspects of the one thing. Religiocentric people do however tend to be both religiously conservative and ethnocentric.\"\n\nThe Hungarian-Jewish historian and anthropologist Raphael Patai mentions religiocentrism as a variable in relationships between religion and culture, \nEach religion also has a definite outlook on its own value in relation to that of other religions. Its relationship to other religions may range from complete toleration to the complete lack of it, with a corresponding range of self-evaluation. This variable, best called religio-centrism (on the analogy of ethnocentrism), can serve as an additional avenue of approach to the study of our subject. (1954:234)\n\nComparing Middle Eastern, Far Eastern, and Western cultures, Patai finds,\nReligion in the Far East is characterized by the absence of religio-centrism: there is a marked toleration of other religions and a mutual borrowing and influencing; in the Middle East and in the West there is a high degree of religio-centrism, with intolerance and scorn of other religions: each religion is exclusive and regards itself as the \"one and only\" true faith. (1954:252)\n\nIn a later survey of the potentials for world peace, Patai differentiated the major modern religions between \"theistic\" and \"nontheistic\".\nThe three great monotheistic religions of the Middle East and the West, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, are the foremost theistic religions and the dominant faiths of about one half of mankind. Common to all theistic religions is a pronounced religiocentrism, expressed most poignantly in the conviction that one's own religion is the one and only true one, and that all the other faiths are erroneous and hence depreciable. In this conviction were rooted the great religious wars which pitted, not only Muslims against Christians, but also various Muslim sects against one another, and likewise made various Christian denominations bitter enemies... The situation is more hopeful in the great nontheistic religions of South, Southeast, and East Asia. These religions, notably Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Confucianism, and Taoism, lack the element of self-assurance and certainty that each is the exclusive possessor of the only truth. (1987:24-25)\n\nIn response, Andrew Wilson, Professor of Scriptural Studies of the Unification Theological Seminary, criticized Patai's opinion as theologically plausible but historically erroneous, citing examples (1987:28) of \"rampant communal violence between Hindus and Buddhists in Sri Lanka and between Sikhs and Hindus in India.\"\n\nReligiocentrism has a specialized meaning for sociologists (Chalfant, Beckley, and Palmer 1994:51). \"This term is related to a common word used in sociological literature, \"ethnocentrism\". Similarly, we might refer to feelings of rightness and superiority resulting from religious affiliation as \"religiocentrism\". Religiocentrism inhibits the ability of a society to achieve adaptation, integration and goal-attainment.\"\n\nMohammed Abu-Nimer, the Director of the Peacebuilding and Development Institute at American University, distinguishes between religiocentrism and \"religiorelativism\".\nA religiorelative person is firm in his/her belief that other religions have the right to exist and be practiced, even if such norms and beliefs are contradictory to one's own set of religious beliefs. Such a person is prone not to engage in violence or discriminatory actions against the others. In contrast, a religiocentric person is a believer who denies other religions' \"truth\" and who holds an absolute truth that leaves no room for different religious practices. Such a person becomes more prone to dehumanize, exclude, and discriminate against other religious groups and individuals. Often, as a result of negative and destructive exposure and experience with conflict and war, religiocentric beliefs not only are exacerbated and easily translated into violence against the enemy (that is, the different other), but also actually grow and prohibit human and peaceful contact with the other. However, there are conflict resolution and peace-building activities and forums that can assist peace workers in such settings to transform a religiocentric into a religiorelative believer. (2004:497)\n\nAbu-Nimer (2004:479-501) analyzes three typical reactions of a religiocentric person to another religion: denial (e.g., Israel not allowing Arabs to purchase or use state land), defense mechanisms (\"There is no salvation outside the Church\"), and minimization (\"We are all the children of God\").\n\n"}

It operates within the portfolio of the Ministry of National Security. The police force was established on 1 March 1840. The Force is headquartered on East Street Hill in Nassau, Bahamas.\n\nFrom the early eighteenth century to the later part of the nineteenth century, the development of policing generally followed the pattern of policing in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. During the first half of this period, men were appointed as constables to assist in the enforcement of government rules and regulations, and the apprehension of offenders. A Night Guard was also assigned to protect the town of Nassau, capital of the British Crown Colony of the Bahamas, during the night.\nAs early as 1729, there was a constable in New Providence. However, his duties seem not to have been as broad and well defined as the police constable of today. This constable was attached to the local Magistrate, Justices of the Peace and several other Government officials.\n\nIn 1799, an Act of the General Assembly, now called the Parliament of the Bahamas, declared that all constables would have the same powers as their counterparts in Great Britain. They were then allowed to arrest on suspicion of crime as opposed to only after the crime had been committed. In 1827, the General Assembly stipulated their mode of appointment. During this period, only one constable was appointed to serve at a time in each district. These appointments were made by the serving magistrate with the assistance of two justices of the peace. \n\nAs time passed and crime increased, a small number of constables were appointed to serve at the same time. However, they were never organised as a formal police force. Each was responsible to the Magistrate in a particular district. This system of constables has evolved into the currently used district and local constables.\n\nDuring the early years of British colonial rule, slaves made up the majority of the population in the Bahamas. The little policing needed was done by the free population with the help of Constables, Magistrates, and Justices of the Peace. Any slave rebellion or potential slave rebellion was kept in check by the local detachment of British soldiers and the slave owners.\n\nPrior to the abolition of slavery by Act of the British Parliament in 1834, there was a system of night patrols in New Providence called the Night Guard. The men forming this guard were not constables, but were also supervised by the local Magistrate. Their duties were primarily to protect the homes and businesses of the free population at night. In addition, the West India Regiment was stationed in Nassau to take care of any serious breach of peace throughout The Bahamas. These men were trained soldiers recruited from different ethnic groups in Africa and the Caribbean. They lived in barracks in isolation from the populations to ensure their loyalty in the event of local slave rebellions. In addition, their duties also included the protection of the Islands from foreign invaders. At that time, the barracks was situated on the site where the Hilton British Colonial Hotel currently stands.\n\nThe majority of the Family Islands which make up The Bahamas were largely neglected as far as law enforcement was concerned, as crime in these areas was almost non-existent.\nPlease visit http://www.royalbahamaspolice.org to learn more about the Police Force and its development.\n\nThe Royal Bahamas Police Force is headed by Ellison E. Greenslade, Dr.h.c., MBA, QPM, the Commissioner of Police (2010–2017) who is supported in his role by a deputy commissioner and seven assistant commissioners. The headquarters of the police service is located in Nassau, New Providence.\nThe rank structure follows the United Kingdom's Scotland Yard usage: constable; corporal; sergeant; inspector; assistant superintendent; superintendent; chief superintendent; assistant commissioner; senior assistant commissioner; deputy commissioner; and commissioner. There are just over 3,000 members on the force.\n\nThe Commissioner is the highest-ranking officer within the police force, superseded only by the Minister of National Security. His responsibilities include ensuring accountability and order, and the guidance and control of all officers and volunteers associated with the force. The current Commissioner of Police is Anthony Ferguson (2018-present).\n\nThe force is divided into three sections: The New Providence District, Grand Bahama District and the Family Islands District. Each district is headed by an Assistant Commissioner. The police service is divided into several different branches, including:\n\nThe Senior Executive Management Team is a group of officers who guide and control the activities of the Royal Bahamas Police Force. It is led by the commissioner, supported by an acting deputy commissioner, a senior assistant commissioner and an assistant commissioner:\n\n\nOperation Rapid Strike is a project launched on 19 January 2011 at 5:00 pm by Commissioner Ellison Greenslade of the Royal Bahamas Police Force. The mandate of this operation is to \"restore peace and civility to our communities\". The stated aims of the project is to hunt persons involved in an array of crimes including murder, armed robberies, stabbings, break-ins, firearms related charges, etc. The operation is led by Senior ranking officers such as Superintendents. Other ranks inside the operation include inspectors, supervisory officers and junior officers. Some equipment used by the members of the operation include two thirty two seats buses provided by the Government of the Bahamas.\n\n\n"}

A physiologist by profession, he contracted poliomyelitis at the age of 9 months but went on to complete Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery from Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi Memorial Medical College, Kanpur and later on Doctor of Medicine in Physiology. He is the first ever Indian to win the prestigious Henry Viscardi Achievement Awards given to extraordinary leaders in global disability community. He is a noted disability activist especially for his sustained efforts in making public places accessible for disabled persons.\n\nUnlocked Central posts for doctors with disability\n\nThe disabled fighter fought for not only his but other disabled doctor’s rights. He also brought into open the discrimination by UPSC which disallowed doctors with disability to apply for various Central Health Services (CHS) posts. He himself was rejected in 2014 but fought and was later allowed to appear for the interview. In 2013, his application was again rejected when he highlighted that the same discrimination was also present for the other posts. He was allowed to apply in a quick intervention. His RTI revealed that doctors with disabilities are not considered eligible for specialist CHS posts in teaching, non-teaching as well as public health specialist cadres. Undeterred, he complained again and requested the health ministry to allow all eligible doctors with disability to apply for these posts. His single handed relentless fight for justice over four years ultimately forced Health Ministry to unlock 1,674 specialist central posts for disabled doctors.\n\nChallenged unfair guidelines of Medical Council of India\n\nHe filed writ petition in the Supreme Court of India & lead successful advocacy of doctors with disabilities to the Central Government to bring amendments in the controversial MCI guidelines lifting the bar on admission of candidates with specified disabilities. \n\nAccessibility of all the medical institutions in India\n\nOn his petition the Court of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities, under Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India instructed Medical Council of India to issue directives to all the medical institutions in India to be disabled-friendly. Despite these efforts, most medical institutions have yet to comply with the directions. His black armband protest on the United Nations' International Day of Persons with Disabilities in 2012 led authorities to construct ramps outside all the hostels at his medical college.\n\nDisabled friendly polling booths\n\nHe played an integral role of whistleblower to raise the issue of problems faced by voters with disability before and during the Delhi legislative assembly elections, 2013 through Right to Information. He also wrote to the election commission as well as the Chief Justice of India to allow disabled voters to vote again before declaration of final results. His RTI on fourth National Voters' Day revealed how Election Commission of India was caught unprepared to enfranchise electors with disability. It showed violation of Supreme Court orders of 2004 to empower voters with disabilities. After the expose Chief Electoral Office, Delhi involved him in making elections in Delhi disabled-friendly. Not only did he sensitise the election officers on how to help electors with disability but he also helped in setting up a disability registration helpline. His sustained efforts led to making election booths across the capital accessible to disabled and elderly voters. Further, on his petition the disability court warned the Election Commission of India to make its website disabled friendly.\n\nFiled first case under the new Disability Law against a cabinet Minister\n\nHe filed the first ever case under the new Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, which has strict punishment for contravention of provisions of Act, against Satyadev Pachauri for publicly ridiculing a disabled employee. If convicted, Pachauri who is minister of khadi and village industries in the Government of Uttar Pradesh, will faces a six month to five-year prison term.\n\nWithdrawal of Union Public Service Commission and Indian Institutes of Technology Joint Entrance Examinations ‘discriminatory proforma’\n\nDr Singh challenged Union Public Service Commission’s format whereby disabled applicants were asked to paste photographs showing their disability as a proof. The Court of Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities directed the UPSC to refrain from asking disabled candidates to submit photographs showing their disabilities and to consider the ‘permanent disability certificate’ issued from a government hospital as a valid proof. His advocacy led to the withdrawal of similar prOforma by IITJEE\n\nDisabled-friendly websites of Delhi Government hospitals\n\nHis judicial activism led to the web accessibility of all the hospitals under Government of Delhi.\n\nPolicy change in duty concession for drivers with disability\nCentral Government provides excise duty concession to disabled customers however Maruti Suzuki denied him the concession on the pretext of right leg disability which was not only discriminatory but illegal. His relentless fight led the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises to amend the rules and quashing manufacturer's certificate and allowing RTO's certificate only.\n\nDignified screening of people with disabilities at airports\n\nAfter being harassed by security personnel at the Hyderabad airport because of his orthosis, Dr Singh approached Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) to amend rustic screening procedures and modify guidelines taking Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities into consideration. The disability watchdog has directed both DGCA and BCAS to make sure people with disabilities are not being harassed or humiliated at airports and that security personnel have been sensitized towards them.\n\nCorrected wrong celebration of Salk's birthday on World Polio Day\n\nRotary International established World Polio Day (24 October) to commemorate the birthday of virologist Jonas Salk who developed polio vaccine. This erroneous observance was first challenged by Dr Singh in his publication in the official journal of the Edward Jenner Society's Vaccine (journal). Even Google dedicated a doodle on Salk's 100th birthday to confirm 28 October as his birthday. Rotary still celebrates the day on 24 October despite media reporting on the contrary.\n\nHis sustained advocacy also lead to ramps being constructed at ATMs. He also raised awareness by highlighting inaccessible ATMs and post offices in the capital to persons with disabilities through Right to Information Act.\n\nSingh is the Coordinator of the Enabling Unit for persons with disabilities and founder of Infinite Ability, a medical humanities group on disability. These are the first such bodies in any medical college in India. He organised the first ever Theatre of the Oppressed workshop for medical students in India. He was also instrumental in organising a unique 'Blind with Camera' workshop for the visually impaired and blind students of University of Delhi in 2012 with Partho Bhowmick.\n\nHe won the prestigious Henry Viscardi Achievement Awards in 2017 which is given by the Viscardi center to recognise exemplary leaders within the disability community for their extraordinary societal contributions. He is the first Indian to get this global award. President, Medical Council of India conferred him 'Medical Personality of the Year' award in 2017. He is also the recipient of State Award by the Government of Delhi for exceptional achievement by a person with disability in the field of social work in 2016. He was also awarded the NCPEDP MphasiS Universal Design Awards 2013 for promoting accessibility and ensuring life of equality and dignity for persons with disabilities.\n"}
{"id": "92792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92792", "title": "Silap Inua", "text": "Silap Inua\n\nIn Inuit mythology, Silap Inua ('possessor of spirit', ᓯᓚᑉ ᐃᓄᐊ) or Silla ('breath, spirit', ᓯᓪᓚ) is similar to mana or ether, the primary component of everything that exists; it is also the breath of life and the method of locomotion for any movement or change. Silla was believed to control everything that goes on in one's life.\n\nSilla is a spirit of the sky, the wind, and the weather. Though identified as male, he is never depicted, and thought to be formless. There are very few myths in which Silla is a character, because he is not thought to have many personality characteristics. He also represents a concept somewhat akin to the Hindu idea of Paramatman, or Emerson’s idea of the great Over soul: Silla is also believed to be the substance which souls are made of. Contrary to the Christian missionaries who have identified Nanook the polar bear spirit as the supreme deity of the Inuit, Silla is much closer to this role. However Silla also has a somewhat malevolent aspect: he is known to lure children away from their play off into the tundra, never to be seen again.\n\nAmong the many various Eskimo cultures, term \"silap inua\" / \"sila\", \"hillap inua\" / \"hilla\" (among Inuit), \"siḷam iñua\" (among Inupiaq), \"ellam yua\" / \"ella\" (among Yup'ik) is used with some diversity. In many instances it refers “outer space”, “intellect”, “weather”, “sky”, “universe”: there may be some correspondence with the presocratic concept of logos.\n\nShamanhood among Eskimo peoples was a diverse phenomenon, just like the various Eskimo cultures themselves. Among Copper Inuit, shamans were believed to obtain their power from this “Wind Indweller”, thus even their helping spirits were termed as \"silap inue\".\n\nAmong Siberian Yupik, was depicted as a mighty hunter, catching game just like earthly men, but being capable of controlling whether people paid attention to customs and traditions.\n\nIn Sireniki Eskimo language, the word has meanings “universe”, “outer world”, “space”, “free space”, “weather”.\n\nAccording to the interpretations of anthropologists, Silla is one of the oldest Inuit deities, but was recently (in the last thousand years) supplanted by Sedna, (the goddess of sea mammals) and the Caribou Mother (the goddess of caribou) when these became the major food sources of the Inuit. Anthropologists believe that the belief is extremely old because of the widespread nature of this deity.\n\n\n"}

Its usage is dated between 5th-12th centuries. It is notable for being the burial place of St. Nicholas of Myra, a 4th-century Christian bishop of the ancient city of Myra, an important religious figure for Eastern Orthodox Christians and Roman Catholics and the historical inspiration for Santa Claus. The Church is on UNESCO's tentative list to become a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe church was built in AD 520 on the foundations of an older Christian church where Saint Nicholas served as a bishop. Over time the church was flooded, filled with silt, and buried. In 1862 it was restored by Russian Tzar Nicholas I, who added a tower and made other changes to its Byzantine architecture. The church is regarded as the 3rd most important Byzantine structure in Anatolia. It is noted for its remarkable wall frescos, and its architectural and religious significance. The northeast annex arcade contains the only example of St Nicholas's life cycle as well.\n\nArchaeological excavations in the Church started in 1988 directed by Prof. S. Yıldız Ötüken of Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey. The work has revealed some of the northern section of the monastery complex, and also the small chapels around the nave, one of which notably contains vibrant frescoes detailing the life and miracles of the saint, and a desecrated sarcophagus which is thought to be the original burial place from which his remains were forcibly translated to Bari in 1087.\n\nThe Orthodox Liturgy is occasionally celebrated in the church on 6 December.\n\n\n"}

The TLG was founded in 1972 by Marianne McDonald (a graduate student at the time and now a professor of theater and classics at the University of California, San Diego) with the goal to create a comprehensive digital collection of all surviving texts written in Greek from antiquity to the present era. Since 1972, the TLG has collected and digitized most surviving literary texts written in Greek from Homer to the fall of Constantinople in 1453 CE, and beyond. Theodore Brunner (1934-2007) directed the project from 1972 until his retirement from the University of California in 1998. Maria Pantelia, also a classics professor at UC Irvine, succeeded Theodore Brunner in 1998, and has been directing the TLG since. TLG's name is shared with its online database, the full title of which is \"Thesaurus Linguae Graecae: A Digital Library of Greek Literature\" (the \"TLG\", in italics, for short).\n\nThe challenge of this huge undertaking was originally met with the help of several classicists and technology experts but primarily thanks to the efforts of David Woodley Packard and his team who created the Ibycus system, namely the hardware and software originally used to proofread and search the corpus. David Packard also developed Beta code, a character and formatting encoding convention used to encode Polytonic Greek. The collection was originally circulated on CD-ROM. The first CD-ROM was released in 1985, and was the first compact disc that did not contain music. Subsequent versions were released in 1988 and in 1992, thanks to technical support provided by David W. Packard.\n\nBy the late 1990s, it became obvious that the old Ibycus technology was outdated. Under the direction of Professor Maria Pantelia, a number of new projects were undertaken, including the massive migration out of the Ibycus, the development of a new state of the art system to digitize, proofread, and manage the textual collection, a new CD-ROM (TLG E), released in 1999, and eventually the move of the corpus to the web environment in 2001. At the same time, the TLG undertook the project of working with the Unicode Technical Committee to include all characters needed to encode and display Greek in the Unicode standard. The corpus continues to be expanded significantly to include Byzantine, medieval, and eventually modern Greek texts. More recent projects include the lemmatization of the Greek corpus (2006) – a substantial undertaking, given the highly inflectional nature of the Greek language and the complexity of the corpus, covering more than two millennia of literary development – and the Online Liddell–Scott–Jones \"Greek–English Lexicon\" (commonly referred to as the LSJ), released in February 2011.\n\nSince 2001, the TLG corpus has been searchable online by members of subscribing institutions, which number close to 1500 worldwide. All bibliographical information and a subset of the texts are available to the general public.\n\nAccording to an undated document on the TLG's web site, the total number of Greek words amounts to 110 million, while the number of unique wordforms amount to 1.6 million and the number of unique lemmata to 250,000.\n\n\n"}

Its use began in the Middle East and the Balkans around 3000 BC. Tin is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, with about 2 parts per million (ppm), compared to iron with 50,000 ppm, copper with 70 ppm, lead with 16 ppm, arsenic with 5 ppm, silver with 0.1 ppm, and gold with 0.005 ppm . Ancient sources of tin were therefore rare, and the metal usually had to be traded over very long distances to meet demand in areas which lacked tin deposits.\n\nKnown sources of tin in ancient times include the southeastern tin belt that runs from Yunnan in China to the Malay Peninsula; Devon and Cornwall in England; Brittany in France; the border between Germany and the Czech Republic; Spain; Portugal; Italy; and central and South Africa (; ). Syria and Egypt have been suggested as minor sources of tin, but the archaeological evidence is inconclusive.\n\nTin extraction and use can be dated to the beginning of the Bronze Age around 3000 BC, during which copper objects formed from polymetallic ores had different physical properties . The earliest bronze objects had tin or arsenic content of less than 2% and are therefore believed to be the result of unintentional alloying due to trace metal content in copper ores such as tennantite, which contains arsenic . The addition of a second metal to copper increases its hardness, lowers the melting temperature, and improves the casting process by producing a more fluid melt that cools to a denser, less spongy metal . This was an important innovation that allowed for the much more complex shapes cast in closed molds of the Bronze Age. Arsenical bronze objects appear first in the Middle East where arsenic is commonly found in association with copper ore, but the health risks were quickly realized and the quest for sources of the much less hazardous tin ores began early in the Bronze Age . This created the demand for rare tin metal and formed a trade network that linked the distant sources of tin to the markets of Bronze Age cultures.\n\nCassiterite (SnO), oxidized tin, most likely was the original source of tin in ancient times. Other forms of tin ores are less abundant sulfides such as stannite that require a more involved smelting process. Cassiterite often accumulates in alluvial channels as placer deposits due to the fact that it is harder, heavier, and more chemically resistant than the granite in which it typically forms . These deposits can be easily seen in river banks, because cassiterite is usually black or purple or otherwise dark, a feature exploited by early Bronze Age prospectors. It is likely that the earliest deposits were alluvial and perhaps exploited by the same methods used for panning gold in placer deposits.\n\nThe importance of tin to the success of Bronze Age cultures and the scarcity of the resource offers a glimpse into that time period's trade and cultural interactions, and has therefore been the focus of intense archaeological studies. However, a number of problems have plagued the study of ancient tin such as the limited archaeological remains of placer mining, the destruction of ancient mines by modern mining operations, and the poor preservation of pure tin objects due to \"tin disease\" or \"tin pest\". These problems are compounded by the difficulty in provenancing tin objects and ores to their geological deposits using isotopic or trace element analyses. Current archaeological debate is concerned with the origins of tin in the earliest Bronze Age cultures of the Near East (; ; ; ; ; ).\n\nEurope has very few sources of tin. Therefore, throughout ancient times it was imported long distances from the known tin mining districts of antiquity. These were the Erzgebirge along the modern border between Germany and Czech Republic, the Iberian Peninsula, Brittany in modern France, and Devon and Cornwall in southwestern Britain (; ). There are several smaller sources of tin in the Balkans and another minor source of tin is known to exist at Monte Valerio in Tuscany, Italy. The Tuscan source was exploited by Etruscan miners around 800 BC, but it was not a significant source of tin for the rest of the Mediterranean . Even at that time, the Etruscans themselves had to import additional tin from the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula, and later from Cornwall .\n\nIt has been claimed that tin was first mined in Europe around 2500 BC in the Erzgebirge, and knowledge of tin bronze and tin extraction techniques spread from there to Brittany and Cornwall around 2000 BC and from northwestern Europe to northwestern Spain and Portugal around the same time . However, the only Bronze Age object from Central Europe whose tin has been scientifically provenanced is the Nebra sky disk, and its tin (and gold, though not its copper), is shown by tin isotopes to have come from Cornwall . In addition, a rare find of a pure tin ingot in Scandinavia was provenanced to Cornwall . Available evidence, though very limited, thus points to Cornwall as the sole early source of tin in Central and Northern Europe.\n\nBrittany – adjacent to Cornwall on the Celtic Sea – has significant sources of tin which show evidence of being extensively exploited after the Roman conquest of Gaul during the first century BC and onwards . Brittany remained a significant source of tin throughout the medieval period.\n\nA group of 52 bronze artifacts from the late Bronze Age Balkans has been shown to have tin of multiple origins, based on the correlation of tin isotope differences with the different find locations of the artifacts. While the locations of these separate tin sources are uncertain, the larger Serbian group of artifacts is inferred to be derived from tin sources in western Serbia (e.g. Mount Cer), while the smaller group, largely from western Romania, is inferred to have western Romanian origins .\n\nIberian tin was widely traded across the Mediterranean during the Bronze Age, and extensively exploited during Roman times. But Iberian tin deposits were largely forgotten throughout the medieval period, were not rediscovered till the 18th century, and only re-gained importance during the mid-19th century .\n\nCornwall and Devon were important sources of tin for Europe and the Mediterranean throughout ancient times and may have been the earliest sources of tin in Western Europe. But within the historical period, they only dominated the European market from late Roman times in the 3rd century AD, with the exhaustion of many Spanish tin mines . Cornwall maintained its importance as a source of tin throughout medieval times and into the modern period .\n\nWestern Asia has very little tin ore; the few sources that have recently been found are too insignificant to have played a major role during most of ancient history . However, it is possible that they were exploited at the onset of the Bronze Age and are responsible for the development of early bronze manufacturing technology (; ). Kestel, in Southern Turkey, is the site of an ancient Casserite mine that was used from 3250 to 1800 BC. It contains miles of tunnels, some only large enough for a child. A grave with children which were probably workers has been found. It was abandoned, with crucibiles and other tools left at the site. The next evidence of the production of pure tin in the Middle East is an ingot from the 1300 BC Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey ().\n\nWhile there are a few sources of cassiterite in Central Asia, namely in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan that show signs of having been exploited starting around 2000 BC , archaeologists disagree about whether they were significant sources of tin for the earliest Bronze Age cultures of the Middle East (; ; ; ).\n\nIn Northern Asia the only tin deposits considered exploitable by ancient peoples occur in the far eastern region of Siberia . This source of tin appears to have been exploited by the Eurasian Steppe people known as the Turbino culture of the Middle Bronze Age (1000 BC) as well as northern Chinese cultures around the same time .\n\nEastern Asia has a number of small cassiterite deposits along the Yellow River which were exploited by the earliest Chinese Bronze Age culture of Erlitou and the Shang Dynasty (2500 to 1800 BC). However, the richest deposits for the region, and indeed the world, lie in Southeastern Asia, stretching from Yunnan in China to the Malay Peninsula. The deposits in Yunnan were not mined until around 700 BC, but by the Han Dynasty had become the main source of tin in China according to historical texts of the Han, Jin, Tang, and Song dynasties . Other cultures of Southeast Asia exploited the abundant cassiterite resources sometime between second and third millennia BC, but due to the lack of archaeological work in the region little else is known about tin exploitation during ancient times in that part of the world.\n\nTin was used in the Indian subcontinent starting between 1500 and 1000 BC (; ). While India does have some small scattered deposits of tin, they were not a major source of tin for Indian Bronze Age cultures as shown by their dependence on imported tin.\n\nWhile rich veins of tin are known to exist in Central and South Africa, whether these were exploited during ancient times is still debated . However, the Bantu culture of Zimbabwe are known to have actively mined, smelted and traded tin between the 11th and 15th centuries AD .\n\nTin deposits exist in many parts of South America, with minor deposits in southern Peru, Colombia, Brazil, and northwestern Argentina, and major deposits of exploitable cassiterite in northern Bolivia. These deposits were exploited as early as 1000 AD in the manufacture of tin bronze by Andean cultures, including the later Inca Empire, which considered tin bronze the \"imperial alloy\". In North America, the only known exploitable source of tin during ancient times is located in the Zacatecas tin province of north central Mexico which supplied west Mexican cultures with enough tin for bronze production .\n\nThe tin belt of Southeast Asia extends all the way down to Tasmania, but metals were not exploited in Australia until the arrival of Europeans in the 18th century.\n\nDue to the scattered nature of tin deposits around the world and its essential nature for the creation of tin bronze, tin trade played an important role in the development of cultures throughout ancient times. Archaeologists have reconstructed parts of the extensive trade networks of ancient cultures from the Bronze Age to modern times using historical texts, archaeological excavations, and trace element and lead isotope analysis to determine the origins of tin objects around the world (; ; ).\n\nThe earliest sources of tin in the Early Bronze Age in the Near East are still unknown and the subject of much debate in archaeology (; ; ; ; ; ; ). Possibilities include minor now-depleted sources in the Near East, trade from Central Asia , Sub-Saharan Africa , Europe, or elsewhere.\n\nIt is possible that as early as 2500 BC, the Erzgebirge had begun exporting tin, using the well established Baltic amber trade route to supply Scandinavia as well as the Mediterranean with tin . By 2000 BC, the extraction of tin in Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal had begun and tin was traded to the Mediterranean sporadically from all these sources. Evidence of tin trade in the Mediterranean can be seen in a number of Bronze Age shipwrecks containing tin ingots such as the Uluburun off the coast of Turkey dated 1300 BC which carried over 300 copper bars weighing 10 tons, and approximately 40 tin bars weighing 1 ton . While Sardinia does not appear to have much in terms of significant sources of tin, it does have rich copper and other mineral wealth and served as a centre for metals trade during the Bronze Age and likely actively imported tin from the Iberian Peninsula for export to the rest of the Mediterranean .\n\nBy classical Greek times, the tin sources were well established. Greece and the Western Mediterranean appear to have traded their tin from European sources, while the Middle East acquired their tin from Central Asian sources through the Silk Road . For example, Iron Age Greece had access to tin from Iberia by way of the Phoenicians who traded extensively there, from the Erzgebirge by way of the Baltic Amber Road overland route, or from Brittany and Cornwall through overland routes from their colony at Massalia (modern day Marseilles) established in the 6th century BC . In 450 BC, Herodotus described tin as coming from Northern European islands named the Cassiterides along the extreme borders of the world, suggesting very long distance trade, likely from Britain, northwestern Iberia, or Brittany, supplying tin to Greece and other Mediterranean cultures . The idea that the Phoenicians went to Cornwall for its tin and supplied it to the whole of the Mediterranean has no archaeological basis and is largely considered a myth .\n\nThe early Roman world was mainly supplied with tin from its Iberian provinces of Gallaecia and Lusitania and to a lesser extent Tuscany. Pliny mentions that in 80 BC, a senatorial decree halted all mining on the Italian Peninsula, stopping any tin mining activity in Tuscany and increasing Roman dependence on tin from Brittany, Iberia, and Cornwall. After the Roman conquest of Gaul, Brittany’s tin deposits saw intensified exploitation after the first century BC . With the exhaustion of the Iberian tin mines, Cornwall became a major supplier of tin for the Romans after the 3rd century AD .\n\nThroughout the medieval period, demand for tin increased as pewter gained popularity. Brittany and Cornwall remained the major producers and exporters of tin throughout the Mediterranean through to modern times .\n\nNear Eastern development of bronze technology spread across Central Asia by way of the Eurasian Steppes, and with it came the knowledge and technology for tin prospection and extraction. By 2000 to 1500 BC Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan appear to have exploited their sources of tin, carrying the resources east and west along the Silk Road crossing Central Asia . This trade link likely followed an existing trade route of lapis lazuli, a highly prized semi-precious blue gemstone, and chlorite vessels decorated with turquoise from Central Asia that have been found as far west as Egypt and that date to the same period .\n\nIn China, early tin was extracted along the Yellow River in Erlitou and Shang times between 2500 and 1800 BC. By Han and later times, China imported its tin from what is today Yunnan province. This has remained China’s main source of tin throughout history and into modern times .\n\nIt is unlikely that Southeast Asian tin from Indochina was widely traded around the world in ancient times as the area was only opened up to Indian, Muslim, and European traders around 800 AD .\n\nIndo–Roman trade relations are well known from historical texts such as Pliny’s \"Natural History\" (book VI, 26), and tin is mentioned as one of the resources being exported from Rome to South Arabia, Somaliland, and India (; ).\n\n\n"}
