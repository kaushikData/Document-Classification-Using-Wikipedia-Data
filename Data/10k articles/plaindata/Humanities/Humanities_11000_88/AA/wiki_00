In situations where one is unsure of the presence of an intelligent agent (such as an enemy or a predator), there is survival value in assuming its presence so that precautions can be taken. For example, if a human came across an indentation in the ground that might be a lion's footprint, it is advantageous to err on the side of caution and assume that the lion is present.\n\nPsychologists Kurt Gray and Daniel Wegner wrote: \n\nSince it takes time to think of why a stimulus is present while simply reacting to it goes much faster, some evolutionary biologists criticize the assumption that agent detection would enhance the ability to escape predators as making a fast escape is of high importance to survive. These biologists state that simple reactions to stimuli that do not take a by-route over speculation about causes, such as running from the shape of certain footprints or a pair of eyes by simple reflex without even making a time-consuming association to a predator, would be selected instead by saving one step and therefore time. As a result, these biologists conclude that there are no specialized brain mechanisms for agent detection.\n\nSome scientists believe that the belief in creator gods is an evolutionary by-product of agent detection. A spandrel is a non-adaptive trait formed as a side effect of an adaptive trait. The psychological trait in question is \"if you hear a twig snap in the forest, some sentient force is probably behind it\". This trait helps to prevent the primate from being murdered or eaten as food. However this hypothetical trait could remain in modern humans: thus some evolutionary psychologists theorize that \"even if the snapping was caused by the wind, modern humans are still inclined to attribute the sound to a sentient agent; they call this person a god\".\n\nGray and Wegner also said that agent detection is likely to be a \"foundation for human belief in God\" but \"simple overattribution of agency cannot entirely account for the belief in God...\" because the human ability to form a theory of mind and what they refer to as \"existential theory of mind\" are also required to \"give us the basic cognitive capacity to conceive of God.\"\n\nAccording to Justin L. Barrett, having a scientific explanation for mental phenomena does not mean we should stop believing in them. “Suppose science produces a convincing account for why I think my wife loves me — should I then stop believing that she does?”\n\n"}

{"id": "552884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=552884", "title": "Aïr Mountains", "text": "Aïr Mountains\n\nThe Aïr Mountains or Aïr Massif (; Hausa:  \"Azbin\",  \"Abzin\") is a triangular massif, located in northern Niger, within the Sahara Desert. Part of the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands ecoregion, they rise to more than and extend over . Lying in the midst of desert north of the 17th parallel, the Aïr plateau, with an average altitude between , forms an island of Sahel climate which supports a wide variety of life, many pastoral and farming communities, and dramatic geological and archaeological sites. There are notable archaeological excavations in the region that illustrate the prehistoric past of this region. The endangered painted hunting dog (\"Lycaon pictus\") once existed in this region, but may now be extirpated due to human population pressures in this region.\n\nThe Precambrian to Cenozoic Aïr Mountains consist of peralkaline granite intrusions which appear dark in colour (unusual since most granitic masses are light-toned in the field). In the Sahara Desert such mountains often stand out in stark relief as topographic heights amidst lowlands covered by sand. The terrain consists of high plateau, mountain ranges, and broad, sandy valleys and seasonal wadis which once contained rivers. Areas of these deep, often intersecting, valleys also contain waterborne clay and silt deposits. Underground watercourses in some of these valleys continue to provide year-round oasis and seasonal vegetation.\nThe Aïr mountains themselves consist of nine almost circular massifs rising from a rocky plateau, bordered by the sand dunes and plain of the Ténéré Desert to the east. The massif is a plateau consisting of a sub-Cambrian age erosion surface on Precambrian metamorphic rocks, punctuated by a series of flat-topped, granite intrusion peaks, which include Mont Idoukal-n-Taghès (Niger's highest point at 2022 m), Mont Tamgak (1988 m), Mont Greboun (1944 m), Adrar Bous, Fadei, Chirriet, Taghmert, Agueraguer, Takaloukouzet, and Goundai.\n\nThe massif contains volcanic features including the extinct caldera of Arakao, Cenozoic lava flows of hawaiite to trachyte composition, volcanic cones, tuff rings and one of the largest ring dike systems in the world. At Izouzaoenehe, lie the marble Blue Mountains, and the lower Zagado valley is surrounded by white marble hills. Carboniferous sandstone and coal units in the Iullemmeden Basin just to the west of the massif contain uranium mineralisation sourced from the granites of the massif.\n\nBecause of its altitude (on average between 500 and 900 m) and despite its low rainfall (50 to 160 mm/year on the lower plateau), the Aïr forms a green region in comparison with the surrounding deserts, especially after the August–September seasonal rains. The climate is classified as Sahel, like that of the regions well to its south. While the mountains are largely bare of vegetation, the dry wadi river valleys (known by the Hausa term \"Kori\") channel and hold rainwater in gueltas (stone pools, such as that near the town of Timia), creating oases which provide forage for animals, and in some areas, farming. The high Bagzane plateau of the central Aïr in particular provides adequate rainfall for intensive agriculture. Other, vast, areas of the region are entirely devoid of plant life and with their volcanic protrusions and rock fields present an otherworldly appearance.\n\nMore than 430 vascular species has been recorded so far in the Aïr mountains. The location of the Aïr as a southern extension of the Hoggar mountain range makes it a connection between the Saharan Flora and the Sahelian Flora. However, the presence of mountains up to 2000 m a.s.l. generates locally favourable conditions for several species of the Sudanian zone and the Mediterranean zone.\n\nDuring the 20th century a series of scientific missions in the Aïr has permitted to identify the majority of plant species developing in the Aïr. \"Acacia tortilis\" subsp. \"raddiana\" (\"Afagag\") and \"Balanites aegyptiaca\" (\"Aborak\") are among the most frequent tree species in the intermountain zone. In the vicinity of temporary rivers named \"koris\", species like \"Acacia nilotica\", \"Faidherbia albida\" and the palm \"Hyphaene thebaica\" coexist with planted date palms \"Phoenix dactylifera\". Severe droughts and high aridity have made the intermountain zone of the Aïr a particularly harsh place for plants to develop. The additional presence of domestic herbivores has led to a severe deficit in tree regeneration, which has been cited as a major ecological concern. Tree regeneration has been observed enhanced as soon as tree seedlings are protected by large tussocks of the frequent grass \"Panicum turgidum\". This positive interaction between plants represents a promising restoration tool to be used by local inhabitants.\n\nIn comparison, mountainous areas are even less documented. Tropical tree species less resistant to drought have been described in the highlands, among which the Fabaceae \"Acacia laeta\" and \"Acacia seyal\". Quezel has observed the remnant presence of a rare endemic taxon related to the olive tree in the northern sector of the Aïr range. Recently, this taxon, \"Olea europaea\" subsp. \"laperrinei\", has been found in other mountains of the Aïr: these very isolated, small populations represent the southern limit of the species distribution. A study led on the slopes of the highest summit in the Aïr, Idoukal’N’Taghes (2022 m a.s.l.), identified plant species that had never been inventoried in Niger before. Among them, \"Pachycymbium decaisneanum\", \"Cleome aculeata\", \"Echinops mildbraedii\" and \"Indigofera nummularia\" are tropical species with relatively low resistance to water stress, whereas \"Silene lynesii\", \"Tephrosia elegans\", and \"Echinops mildbraedii\" have a Saharan-Mediterranean distribution. Three ferns were found for the first time in the Aïr recently, \"Cheilanthes coriacea\", \"Actiniopteris radiata\", and \"Ophioglossum polyphyllum\", suggesting that ferns may be more prone to develop in arid environments than commonly proposed. All these data evidence a marked mountain climatic specificity in the Aïr, with a positive impact on species richness and species diversity. Because of their strong geographic isolation within a Saharan matrix, these species have a high conservation value.\n\nThe town of Agadez in the heart of the Tuareg country is the capital of Aïr. Much of the Tuareg population of Aïr until recently led a nomadic life, relying essentially on camel and goats from which they take milk, meat and skins used in the production of local handicrafts. Most sedentary populations were either dependents of higher caste Tuareg pastoralists or the Ikelan ( \"Bouzou\" in Hausa / \"Bella\" in Songhai), former slaves and captives of the Tuareg from Hausa and other southern peoples. These peoples were settled in northern oases, to tend the date palm plantations held by the noble clans.\n\nAgriculture products from oases such as Timia, Aouderas and Tabelot are traditionally exchanged against clothes, or salt, brought by camel caravans (Azalai) from the remote Tenere oases of Bilma and Fachi to the east.\n\nThe Aïr is known for its rock art, dating from 6000 BC to around AD 1000. During the Neolithic Subpluvial the region was a pastoral area, as is illustrated by images of cattle and large mammals. During the 3rd millennium BC, however, a process of desertification began and the Tuareg from further north migrated into the region. Later art indicated war, depicting horses and chariots. In particular, a five-meter-high carving of a giraffe at Dabous discovered in 1999 is internationally famous. Cave art in the region is predominantly stone carving, initially with sharp rock, and from around 1200 BC perhaps with metal.\n\nWhen the Tuareg tribes were pushed south by Arab invaders in the eighth and ninth centuries, there were Gobirwa Hausa in the southern Aïr. Successive Tuareg \"Tel\"s have controlled the area since at least the twelfth century. Agadez, as well as In-Gall to the east, were the farthest outposts of the Songhai Empire in the early 15th century. In the sixteenth century the area fell under the newly created Tuareg Sultanate of Aïr, and remained so until the arrival of the French at the end of the 19th.\n\nThe emergence of the French weakened the Tuareg Kels and provoked both infighting and resistance to colonialism. From the 1880s, Toubu raids increased, and when the Tuareg Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen rose against the French in 1917, many towns were destroyed on his way to the siege of Agadez. When the French retook Agadez, a brutal punitive expedition through the Aïr left many formerly populous places abandoned, razed by Kaosen and the French successively.\n\nWhile the Kel Owey continued to dominate the settled oasis towns and pastoral herding, the sedentary farmers (Tuareg, Hausa, or Songhai) expanded farming and sedentary livestock cultivation in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe famines of the 1970s and 1980s brought an end to this expansion, and as Agadez and Arlit grew, the towns of the Aïr have shrunk. The Tuareg Rebellion of the 1990s saw brutal government reprisals which depopulated many villages in the Aïr. Peace from the mid-1990s, as well as the uranium mines of Arlit brought unprecedented growth to the region, with many small towns gaining valuable tourism revenue. In 2004, a locust invasion ravaged many gardens, bringing scarcity and contributing to the Second Tuareg Rebellion (beginning in 2007) which continues to plague the region, effectively ending the nascent tourist industry.\n\n\n\n"}

Traditionally this is achieved by carbonising wood in a charcoal pile or kiln. As an occupation it has almost died out in the first world countries.\n\nCharcoal burning is one of the oldest human crafts. The knowledge gained from this industry still contributes to the solution of energy problems today. Due to its historical and cultural importance, charcoal burning and tar distilling were incorporated in December 2014 into the register of the Intangible Cultural Heritage in Germany by the \"Kultusministerkonferenz\".\n\nSince the Iron Age, high temperatures have had to be produced for iron smelting, for glassmaking and for the working of precious metals. Charcoal has been used to do this for centuries and, in order to produce it, entire forests were felled. With the increasing use of stone coal from the 18th century, the charcoal burning industry declined.\n\nEven in ancient times, charcoal was manufactured in kilns. Logs were arranged in a conical heap (a charcoal kiln or pile) around posts, a fire shaft was made using brushwood and wood chips and covered with an airtight layer of grass, moss and earth. The pile was ignited inside the fire shaft and, at a temperature of between 300 and 350 °C, the carbonization process began. The process took six to eight days - in large kilns several weeks - during which time the charcoal burner had to control the draught (by piercing small holes and resealing them), being careful neither to allow the pile to go out nor let it go up in flames. By observing the smoke exiting the kiln, the charcoal burner could assess the state of the carbonization process. If the smoke was thick and gray, the wood was still raw; thin, blue smoke indicated good carbonization.\n\nIn earlier times, charcoal burners led an austere, lonely life. They had to live near the kiln, usually in a charcoal burner's hut (\"Köhlerhütte\" or \"Köte\" in Germany, Austria and Switzerland). During the Middle Ages, charcoal burners were ostracised. Their profession was considered dishonourable and they were frequently accused of evil practices. Even today there is a certain denigration of this former occupation. In the German language to have a charcoal burner's faith (\"Köhlerglauben\") is to have blind faith in something. That aside, the continuing requirement to keep the kiln at the right temperature in all weathers meant that the job must have been arduous, lonely and, at times, dangerous.\n\nCharcoal burning is still carried out commercially in parts of the world. It is rare in Europe, but still practised in Romania, Poland, and Switzerland. Other places where it is still common are the tropical rain forests of South America and Africa. \n\nEven in the 20th century, charcoal burners in remote areas like the Harz Mountains and the Thuringian Forest, still used \"Hillebille\"s, a large contraption of beechwood boards, used as alarm and signal device. This is commemorated in the name of a mountain ridge in the Harz, called \"Hillebille\". Today the tradition of this old craft is mainly preserved in clubs and societies. The best known are the European Charcoal Burners' Society (\"Europäische Köhlerverein\") and the Glasofen Charcoal Burners' Society (\"Köhlerverein Glasofen\").\n\nA. A. Milne's poem \"The Charcoal Burner\" appeared in \"Now We Are Six\", a collection of verse. It begins:\n\nThe Charcoal Burner has tales to tell.\n<br>He lives in the forest,\n<br>alone in the forest;\n<br>he sits in the forest,\n<br>alone in the forest.\n<br>And the sun comes slanting between the trees\n\n\n"}

It typically means to develop a writing system, set up official rules for grammar, orthography, pronunciation, syntax and vocabulary as well as publishing grammar books, dictionaries and similar guidelines. Several variants exist for a specific aspect, e.g. different ways of spelling a word, decisions on which variant is going to be the standard one have to be made.\n\nIn some countries such codification is done by a body constituted by the state, such as the Académie française. Codification often happens due to new inventions, changes in values or other cultural influences. After the process of decolonialization, many African states had to decide whether they wanted to keep the colonial language or chose one (or more) of their indigenous language varieties as official languages, which made language planning necessary.\n\nIn a well-known model of language planning by Einar Haugen, codification is only the second step. Step one is the selection process, step three is the implementation of the changes in society and step four is the elaboration of vocabulary (especially technical terms). In the process of language planning, two major levels exist: corpus planning and status planning (Heinz Kloss). Codification is part of the corpus planning of a language, because the \"body\" of the language itself is being planned as opposed to status planning, where the prestige and usage of a language is enhanced:\n\n\nWhether the codification is successful depends heavily on its acceptance by the population as well as its form of implementation by the government, e.g. promoting its prestige and spread, teaching the norm in school and language courses, and so on.\n\n\n\n"}

Metzger defines them as the way people \"use their body, head, and eye gaze to report the actions, thoughts, words, and expressions of characters within a discourse\". Constructed action is when a speaker performs the actions of someone else in the narrative, while constructed dialogue is when a speaker acts as the other person in a reported dialogue. Constructed action is very common cross-linguistically.\n\nConstructed action is common in many languages when telling stories or reporting the actions of others. During a narrative, the speaker not only reports the actions of others but performs them as well. The actions performed are not the exact actions of the person but an action constructed by the speaker. Liddell gives the example of a speaker patting their pockets when talking about someone having lost their keys. Since the speaker has not lost their own keys, the only reason they would pat their pockets would be to illustrate the story they are telling. The addressee then understands these actions not as the speaker's but of a character within the story.\n\nConstructed dialogue is when a speaker assumes the role of a character in the discourse. It often includes role-shifting, directed gaze, and body movement. For example, in American Sign Language, a speaker may utilize constructed dialogue by shifting their body to denote different characters and directing their gaze to particular points. The signs produced are then understood as the signing of the character, not of the speaker themselves.\n"}

Hobson listened to recordings of his own psychotherapeutic practice with more disturbed clients, and became aware of the ways in which a patient's self – their unique sense of personal being – can come alive and develop, or be destroyed, in the flux of the conversation in the consulting room.\n\nThe conversational model views the aim of therapy as allowing the growth of the patient's self through encouraging a form of conversational relating called 'aloneness-togetherness'. This phrase is reminiscent of Winnicott's idea of the importance of being able to be 'alone in the presence of another'. The client comes to eventually feel recognised, accepted and understood as who they are; their sense of personal being, or self, is fostered; and they can start to drop the destructive defenses which disrupt their sense of personal being.\n\nThe development of the self implies a capacity to embody and span the dialectic of 'aloneness-togetherness' - rather than being disposed toward either schizoid isolation (aloneness) or merging identification with the other (togetherness). Although the therapy is described as psychodynamic, and is accordingly concerned to identify activity and personal meaning in the midst of apparent passivity, it relies more on careful empathic listening and the development of a common 'feeling language' than it does on psychoanalytic interpretation.\n\nIn its manualised form ('PIT'), the conversational model is presented as having seven interconnected components. These are:\n\n<br>    Together with the patient generate an understanding which links emotional or somatic symptoms with interpersonal difficulties \n<br>    In developing a shared understanding, the therapist uses statements rather than questions, uses mutual ('I' and 'We') language, deploys conditional rather than absolute statements of understanding, allows metaphorical elaborations of the patient's experience to unfold, and makes tentative interpretations or 'hypotheses' about the meaning of the patient's experience.\n<br>    Feelings that are present in the room are encouraged; abstract talk about feelings by the therapist is discouraged.\n<br>    Gently commenting on the presence of hidden feelings or the absence of expected feelings.\n<br>    Interpretations are provided which link the dynamics of the current therapeutic interaction with problematic present and past interactions in the patient's life.\n<br>    The therapist does not jump in with explanatory interpretations before laying the groundwork of the therapeutic relationship and jointly understanding the emotions present in the room.\n<br>    Emotional changes that are made by the patient during therapy are offered positive reinforcement.\n\nThe conversational model, which has been manualised as Psychodynamic-Interpersonal Therapy, has been subject to outcome research, and has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of depression, psychosomatic disorders, self-harm, and borderline personality disorder.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "185123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185123", "title": "Coureur des bois", "text": "Coureur des bois\n\nA coureur des bois () or coureur de bois (; \"runner of the woods\"; plural: coureurs de bois) was an independent entrepreneurial French-Canadian trader who traveled in New France and the interior of North America. They ventured into unsettled areas (the woods) usually to trade with First Nations peoples: exchanging various European items for furs. Along the way they learned the trades and practices of the Native people. These expeditions were part of the beginning of the fur trade in the North American interior. Initially they traded for beaver coats but, as the market grew, \"coureurs de bois\" were trapping and trading prime beavers whose skins were to be felted in Europe.\n\nWhile the French had been trading and living among the natives since the earliest days of New France, coureurs des bois reached their apex during the second half of the 17th century. After 1681, the independent coureur des bois was gradually replaced by state-sponsored voyageurs, who were workers associated with licensed fur traders. They traveled extensively by canoe. Coureurs des bois lost their importance in the fur trade by the early 18th century. However, even while their numbers were dwindling, the coureur des bois developed as a symbol of the colony, creating a lasting myth that would continue to define New France for centuries.\nShortly after founding a permanent settlement at Quebec City in 1608, Samuel de Champlain sought to ally himself with the local native peoples or First Nations. He decided to send French boys to live among them to learn their languages in order to serve as interpreters, in the hope of persuading the natives to trade with the French rather than with the Dutch, who were active along the Hudson River and Atlantic coast.\n\nThese boys learned native languages, customs, and skills, and tended to assimilate quickly to their new environments. For instance, upon visiting Étienne Brûlé a year after leaving him in 1610 with a Huron tribe, Champlain was surprised to find the young boy attired completely in native clothing and able to converse fluently in the Huron language.\nEarly explorers such as Brûlé could educate the French colonists on the complex trading networks of the natives, serve as interpreters, and encourage the burgeoning fur trade. Between 1610 and 1629, dozens of Frenchmen spent months at a time living among the natives. Over time, these early explorers and interpreters played an increasingly active role in the fur trade, paving the way for the emergence of the coureurs des bois proper in the mid-17th century.\n\nThe term \"coureur des bois\" is most strongly associated with those who engaged in the fur trade in ways that were considered to be outside of the mainstream. Early in the North American fur trade era, this term was applied to men who circumvented the normal channels by going deeper into the wilderness to trade.\n\nTraditionally, the government of New France preferred to let the natives supply furs directly to French merchants, and discouraged French settlers from venturing outside the Saint Lawrence valley. By the mid-17th century, Montreal had emerged as the center of the fur trade, hosting a yearly fair in August where natives exchanged their pelts for European goods. Thus, while coureurs des bois never entirely disappeared, they were heavily discouraged by French colonial officials. In 1649, however, the new governor Louis d'Ailleboust permitted Frenchmen familiar with the wilderness to visit \"Huron country\" to encourage and escort Hurons to Montreal to participate in the trade. While this did not legally sanction coureurs des bois to trade independently with the natives, some historians consider d'Ailleboust's encouragement of independent traders to mark the official emergence of the coureurs des bois.\n\nIn the 1660s, several factors resulted in a sudden spike in the number of coureurs des bois. First, the population of New France markedly increased during the late 17th century, as the colony experienced a boom in immigration between 1667–84. Of the new \"engagés\" (indentured male servants), discharged soldiers, and youthful immigrants from squalid, class-bound Europe arriving in great numbers in the colony, many chose freedom in the life of the coureur des bois. Furthermore, renewed peaceful relations with the Iroquois in 1667 made traveling into the interior of Canada much less perilous for the French colonists. The companies that had been monopolizing and regulating the fur trade since 1645, the \"Cent Associés\" and the \"Communautés des Habitants\", went bankrupt after the Iroquois war. The \"Compagnie des Indes occidentales\", which replaced them, was much less restrictive of internal trade, allowing independent merchants to become more numerous. Finally, a sudden fall in the price of beaver on the European markets in 1664 caused more traders to travel to the \"pays d'en haut\", or upper country (the area around the Great Lakes), in search of cheaper pelts. During the mid-1660s, therefore, becoming a coureur des bois became both more feasible and profitable.\n\nThis sudden growth alarmed many colonial officials. In 1680, the intendant Duchesneau estimated that there were eight hundred coureurs des bois, or about 40% of the adult male population. However, reports like that were wildly exaggerated: in reality, even at their zenith coureurs des bois remained a very small percentage of the population of New France.\n\nIn 1681, to curb the unregulated business of independent traders and their burgeoning profits, French minister of marine Jean-Baptiste Colbert created a system of licenses for fur traders, known as \"congés\". Initially, this system granted 25 annual licenses to merchants traveling inland. The recipients of these licenses came to be known as \"voyageurs\" (travelers), who canoed and portaged fur trade goods in the employ of a licensed fur trader or fur trading company. The congé system, therefore, created the voyageur, the legal and respectable counterpart to the coureur des bois. Under the voyageurs, the fur trade began to favor a more organized business model of the times, including monopolistic ownership and hired labor. From 1681 onwards, therefore, the voyageurs began to eclipse the coureurs des bois, although coureurs des bois continued to trade without licenses for several decades. Following the implementation of the congé system, the number of coureurs des bois dwindled, as did their influence within the colony.\n\nA successful coureur des bois had to possess many skills, including those of businessman and expert canoeist. To survive in the Canadian wilderness, coureurs des bois also had to be competent in a range of activities including fishing, snowshoeing and hunting. As one Jesuit described them, venturing into the wilderness suited \"the sort of person who thought nothing of covering five to six hundred leagues by canoe, paddle in hand, or of living off corn and bear fat for twelve to eighteen months, or of sleeping in bark or branch cabins\". As the life was both physically arduous and illegal, succeeding as a coureur was extremely difficult. However, the hope of making a profit motivated many, while the promise of adventure and freedom was enough to convince others to become outlaws.\n\nBecause of the lack of roads and the necessity to transport heavy goods and furs, fur trade in the interior of the continent depended on men conducting long-distance transportation by canoe of fur trade goods, and returning with pelts. Early travel was dangerous and the \"coureurs des bois\", who traded in uncharted territory, had a high mortality rate. Typically, they left Montreal in the spring, as soon as the rivers and lakes were clear of ice (usually May), their canoes loaded with supplies and goods for trading. The course west to the richest beaver lands usually went by way of the Ottawa and Mattawa rivers; it required numerous overland portages. Alternatively, some canoes proceeded by way of the upper St. Lawrence River and the lakes, passing by Detroit on the way to Michilimackinac or Green Bay. This route had fewer portages, but in times of war, it was more exposed to Iroquois attacks. The powerful Five Nations of the Confederacy had territory along the Great Lakes and sought to control their hunting grounds.\n\nSuch trading journeys often lasted for months and covered thousands of kilometers, with the \"coureurs des bois\" sometimes paddling twelve hours a day. Packing a canoe for such a trip was often arduous, as more than thirty articles were considered essential for a coureur des bois's survival and business. He could trade for food, hunt, and fish—but trade goods such as \"broadcloth, linen and wool blankets, ammunition, metal goods (knives, hatchets, kettles), firearms, liquor, gunpowder and sometimes even finished clothing, took up the majority of space in the canoe.\" Food en route needed to be lightweight, practical and non-perishable.\n\nThe business of a \"coureur des bois\" required close contact with the indigenous peoples. Native peoples were essential because they trapped the fur-bearing animals (especially beaver) and prepared the skins. Relations between \"coureurs\" and natives were not always peaceful, and could sometimes become violent. In general, however, trade was made much easier by the two groups maintaining friendly relations. Trade was often accompanied by reciprocal gift-giving; to the Algonquin and others, exchanging gifts was customary practice to maintain alliances. Pierre-Esprit Radisson and his companions, for instance, \"struck agreeable relations with Natives inland by giving European goods as gifts\".Furthermore, relations between the coureur de bois and the natives often included a sexual dimension; Marriage 'à la façon du pays' (following local custom) was common between native women and coureurs des bois, and later between native women and voyageurs. These unions were of benefit to both sides, and in later years, winter partners of major trading companies also took native wives. As wives, indigenous women played a key role as translators, guides and mediators- becoming \"women between\". For one thing, Algonquin communities typically had far more women than men, likely as a result of warfare. The remaining marriages between Algonquins tended to be polygamous, with one husband marrying two or more women. Sexual relationships with coureurs des bois therefore offered native women an alternative to polygamy in a society with few available men.\n\nTo French military commanders, who were often also directly involved in the fur trade, such marriages were beneficial in that they improved relations between the French and the natives. Native leaders also encouraged such unions, particularly when the couple formed lasting, permanent bonds. Jesuits and some upper-level colonial officials, however, viewed these relationships with dislike and disgust. French officials preferred coureurs des bois and voyageurs to settle around Quebec City and Montreal. They considered the lasting relationships with native women to be further proof of the lawlessness and perversion of the coureurs des bois.\n\nThe role and importance of the coureurs des bois have been exaggerated over the course of history. This figure has achieved mythological status, leading to many false accounts, and to the coureurs des bois being assimilated with \"Canadiens\" (Canadians).\n\nThe myth-making followed two paths. Initially, people in France judged the colonies according to the fears and apprehensions that they had in the Ancien Régime. If order and discipline were proving difficult to maintain in continental Europe, then it seemed impossible that the colonies would fare any better; indeed, it was presumed that things would be even worse. Accounts of young men choosing a life where they would \"do nothing\", be \"restrained by nothing\", and live \"beyond the possibility of correction\" played into the French elite's fears of insubordination and only served to confirm their prejudice; and thus coureurs des bois became emblematic of the colony for those in the metropolis. \n\nThe myth of the coureurs des bois as representative of the Canadians was stimulated by the writings of 18th-century Jesuit priest F-X. Charlevoix and the 19th-century American historian Francis Parkman; their historical accounts are classified as belonging to popular rather than academic history. Charlevoix was particularly influential in his writings, because he was a trusted source of information, as he was a Jesuit priest who had journeyed in Canada. But his \"historical\" work has been criticized by historians for being too \"light\" and for relying too heavily on other authors' material (i.e. plagiarizing), rather than his own first-hand account. Critics of Charlevoix have also noted that in his account, he confuses different periods of time, and therefore does not differentiate between voyageurs and coureurs des bois, misrepresenting the importance of the latter in terms of number and proportion in terms on influence on trading. But Charlevoix was influential; his work was often cited by other authors, which further propagated the myth of the Canadian as a coureur des bois.\n\nFinally, romans du terroir (rural novels) also added to the myth of the coureurs des bois by featuring them out of proportion to their number and influence. The coureurs des bois were portrayed in such works as extremely virile, free-spirited and of untameable natures, ideal protagonists in the romanticized novels of important 19th-century writers such as Chateaubriand, Jules Verne and Fenimore Cooper.\n\nMost coureurs des Bois were primarily or solely fur trade entrepreneurs and not individually well known. The most prominent coureurs des bois were also explorers and gained fame as such.\n\nÉtienne Brûlé was the first European to see the Great Lakes. He traveled to New France with Samuel de Champlain.\n\nJean Nicolet (Nicollet) de Belleborne (Ca. 1598 – 1 November 1642) was a French coureur des bois noted for exploring Green Bay in what is now the U.S. state of Wisconsin. Nicolet was born in Normandy, France in the late 1590s and moved to New France in 1618. In that same year, he was recruited by Samuel de Champlain who arranged for him to live with a group of Algonquians, designated as the \"Nation of the Isle\" to learn Native languages and later serve as an interpreter. The Natives quickly adopted Nicolet as one of their own, even allowing him to attend councils and negotiate treaties. In 1620, Nicolet was sent to make contact with the Nipissing, a group of natives who played an important role in the growing fur trade. After having established a good reputation for himself, Nicolet was sent on an expedition to Green Bay to settle a peace agreement with the Natives of that area.\n\nMédard Chouart des Groseilliers (1618–1696) was a French explorer and fur trader in Canada. In the early 1640s, Des Groseilliers relocated to Quebec, and began to work around Huronia with the Jesuit Missions in that area. There, he learned the skills of a \"coureur des bois\", and in 1653 married his second wife, Margueritte. Her brother, Pierre-Esprit Radisson, also became a notable figure in the fur trade and is often mentioned in the same breath as des Groseilliers. Radisson and des Grosseilliers would also travel and trade together, as they did throughout the 1660s and 1670s. Together, they explored west into previously unknown territories in search of trade. Having incurred legal problems in New France because of their trade, the two explorers went to France in an attempt to rectify their legal situation. When this attempt failed, the pair turned to the English. Through this liaison with the English and thanks to their considerable knowledge and experience in the area, the pair are credited with the establishment of the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nPierre-Esprit Radisson (1636–1710) was a French-Canadian fur trader and explorer. His life as explorer and trader is crucially intertwined with that of his brother-in-law, Médard des Groseilliers. Radisson came to New France in 1651, settling in Trois-Rivières. That same year, he was captured by the Mohawks while duck hunting. Although two of his companions were killed during this exchange, the Natives spared Radisson's life and adopted him. Through this adoption, Radisson learned native languages that would later serve him well as an interpreter. He worked throughout the 1660s and 1670s with his brother-in-law, des Groseilliers, on various trade and exploration voyages into the west of the continent. Much of Radisson's life during this period is wrapped up in the story of des Groseilliers. Together they are credited with the establishment and shaping of the Hudson's Bay Company.\n\nDaniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut (1639–1710) was a French soldier and explorer who is the first European known to have visited the area where the city of Duluth, Minnesota is now located and the headwaters of the Mississippi River near Grand Rapids.\n\nJacques La Ramee (1784–1821)\n\nPierre de La Vérendrye (1685–1749)\n\nLouis-Joseph de La Vérendrye and his three brothers, the sons of the Vérendrye mentioned above (1717-1761)\n\nFrançois Baby (1733–1820)\n\nJacques Baby (1731–1789)\n\nHorace Bélanger (1836–1892)\n\nJean-Marie Ducharme (1723–1807)\n\nDominique Ducharme (1765–1853)\n\nLuc de la Corne (1711–1784)\n\nJacques de Noyon (1668–1745)\n\nThe 1910 Victor Herbert operetta \"Naughty Marietta\" featured the male-chorus marching song \"Tramp Tramp Tramp (Along the Highway)\", which included the words, \"Blazing trails along the byway / Couriers de Bois are we\" [sic]. (Some later versions change Rida Johnson Young's lyric to \"For men of war are we.\")\n\nIn James A. Michener's 1974 historical novel, \"Centennial\" and the 1978–1979 NBC television mini-series of the \"same name\", the colorful, French Canadian or French Metis, coureur des bois, from Montreal, Quebec, Canada, named Pasquinel, was introduced as an early frontier mountain man and trapper, in 1795 Colorado, Spanish Upper Louisiana Territory of Mexico, now the present-day state of Colorado. Pasquinel was portrayed in the miniseries by American TV actor Robert Conrad. The fictional character of Pasquinel was loosely based on the lives of French-speaking fur traders Jacques La Ramee and Ceran St. Vrain. In a 1990 skit called \"Trappers,\" the Canadian comedy troupe The Kids in the Hall depict two trappers, Jacques (Dave Foley) and François (Kevin McDonald), canoeing through high-rise offices and cubicles to trap businessmen wearing designer Italian suits as a parody of this moment in Canadian colonial history. More recently, in 2015, \"The Revenant\", directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, depicts a group of uncharacteristically violent, anti-Indian coureurs des bois in North Dakota, which was contrary to these trappers, who embraced the culture and way of life of Native Americans.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "477975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477975", "title": "Cultural identity", "text": "Cultural identity\n\n1\nCultural identity is the identity or feeling of belonging to a group. It is part of a person's self-conception and self-perception and is related to nationality, ethnicity, religion, social class, generation, locality or any kind of social group that has its own distinct culture. In this way, cultural identity is both characteristic of the individual but also of the culturally identical group of members sharing the same cultural identity or upbringing.\n\nVarious modern cultural studies and social theories have investigated cultural identity and understanding . In recent decades, a new form of identification has emerged which breaks down the understanding of the individual as a coherent whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers. These cultural identifiers may be the result of various conditions including: location, gender, race, history, nationality, language, sexuality, religious beliefs, ethnicity, aesthetics, and even food. As one author writes, recognizing both coherence and fragmentation:\n\nThe divisions between cultures can be very fine in some parts of the world, especially in rapidly changing cities where the population is ethnically diverse and social unity is based primarily on locational contiguity.\n\nAs a \"historical reservoir,\" culture is an important factor in shaping identity. Since one of the main characteristics of a culture is its \"historical reservoir,\" many if not all groups entertain revisions, either consciously or unconsciously, in their historical record in order to either bolster the strength of their cultural identity or to forge one which gives them precedent for actual reform or change. \nSome critics of cultural identity argue that the preservation of cultural identity, being based upon difference, is a divisive force in society, and that cosmopolitanism gives individuals a greater sense of shared citizenship. When considering practical association in international society, states may share an inherent part of their 'make up' that gives common ground and an alternative means of identifying with each other. Nations provide the framework for culture identities called external cultural reality, which influences the unique internal cultural realities of the individuals within the nation.\n\nAlso of interest is the interplay between cultural identity and new media.\n\nRather than necessarily representing an individual's interaction within a certain group, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the social norms as presented by the media. Accordingly, instead of learning behaviour and knowledge from cultural/religious groups, individuals may be learning these social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity.\n\nA range of cultural complexities structure the way individuals operate with the cultural realities in their lives. Nation is a large factor of the cultural complexity, as it constructs the foundation for individual's identity but it may contrast with ones cultural reality. Cultural identities are influenced by several different factors such as ones religion, ancestry, skin colour, language, class, education, profession, skill, family and political attitudes. These factors contribute to the development of one's identity.\n\nCultural identity is essentially how we as individuals cater to all positions of our lives. We may be teachers, students, friends, bosses, employees, etc. How we act and how our schemas contribute to our positions are the building blocks of your overall cultural identity.\n\nIt is also noted that an individual's \"cultural arena\", or place where one lives, impacts the culture that that person chooses to abide by. The surroundings, the environment, the people in these places play a factor in how one feels about the culture they wish to adopt. Many immigrants find the need to change their culture in order to fit into the culture of most citizens in the country. This can conflict with an immigrant's current belief in their culture and might pose a problem, as the immigrant feels compelled to choose between the two presenting cultures.\n\nSome might be able to adjust to the various cultures in the world by committing to two or more cultures. It is not required to stick to one culture. Many people socialize and interact with people in one culture in addition to another group of people in another culture. Thus cultural identity is able to take many forms and can change depending on the cultural area. The nature of the impact of cultural arena has changed with the advent of the Internet, bringing together groups of people with shared cultural interests who before would have been more likely to integrate into their real world cultural arena. This plasticity is what allows people to feel like part of society wherever they go.\n\nLanguage develops from the wants of the people who tend to disperse themselves in a common given location over a particular period of time. This tends to allow people to share a way of life that generally links individuals in a certain culture that is identified by the people of that group. The affluence of communication that comes along with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories. Language can function as a fluid and ever changing identifier, and can be developed in response or rebellion of another cultural code, such as creole languages in the US . \n\nLanguage also includes the way people speak with peers, family members, authority figures, and strangers, including the tone and familiarity that is included in the language.\n\nLanguage learning process can also be affected by cultural identity via the understanding of specific words, and the preference for specific words when learning and using a second language.\n\nSince many aspects of a person's cultural identity can be changed, such as citizenship or influence from outside cultures can change cultural traditions, language is a main component of cultural identity.\n\nKevin McDonough pointed out, in his article, several factors concerning support or rejection of the government for different cultural identity education systems. Other authors have also shown concern for the state support regarding equity for children, school transitions and multicultural education. During March 1998, the two authors, Linda D. Labbo and Sherry L. Field collected several useful books and resources to promote multicultural education in South Africa.\n\nIdentity development among immigrant groups has been studied across a multi-dimensional view of acculturation. Dina Birman and Edison Trickett (2001) conducted a qualitative study through informal interviews with first-generation Soviet Jewish Refugee adolescents looking at the process of acculturation through three different dimensions: language competence, behavioral acculturation, and cultural identity. The results indicated that, “…acculturation appears to occur in a linear pattern over time for most dimensions of acculturation, with acculturation to the American culture increasing and acculturation to the Russian culture decreasing. However, Russian language competence for the parents did not diminish with length of residence in the country” (Birman & Trickett, 2001).\n\nIn a similar study, Phinney, Horencyzk, Liebkind, and Vedder (2001) focused on a model, which concentrates on the interaction between immigrant characteristics and the responses of the majority society in order to understand the psychological effects of immigration. The researchers concluded that most studies find that being bicultural, having a combination of having a strong ethnic and national identity, yields the best adaptation in the new country of residence. An article by LaFromboise, L. K. Colemna, and Gerton, reviews the literature on the impact of being bicultural. It is shown that it is possible to have the ability to obtain competence within two cultures without losing one’s sense of identity or having to identity with one culture over the other. (LaFromboise Et Al. 1993) The importance of ethnic and national identity in the educational adaptation of immigrants indicates that a bicultural orientation is advantageous for school performance (Portes & Rumbaut, 1990). Educators can assume their positions of power in beneficially impactful ways for immigrant students, by providing them with access to their native cultural support groups, classes, after–school activities, and clubs in order to help them feel more connected to both native and national cultures. It is clear that the new country of residence can impact immigrants’ identity development across multiple dimensions. Biculturalism can allow for a healthy adaptation to life and school. With many new immigrant youth, a school district in Alberta, Canada has gone as far as to partner with various agencies and professionals in an effort to aid the cultural adjustment of new Filipino immigrant youths . In the study cited, a combination of family workshops and teacher professional development aimed to improve the language learning and emotional development of these youths and families .\n\nHow great is \"Achievement Loss Associated with the Transition to Middle School and High School\"? John W. Alspaugh's research is in the September/October 1998 \"Journal of Educational Research\" (vol. 92, no. 1), 2026. Comparing three groups of 16 school districts, the loss was greater where the transition was from sixth grade than from a K-8 system. It was also greater when students from multiple elementary schools merged into a single middle school. Students from both K-8 and middle schools lost achievement in transition to high school, though this was greater for middle school students, and high school dropout rates were higher for districts with grades 6-8 middle schools than for those with K-8 elementary schools.\n\nThe Jean S. Phinney Three-Stage Model of Ethnic Identity Development is a widely accepted view of the formation of cultural identity. In this model cultural Identity is often developed through a three-stage process: unexamined cultural identity, cultural identity search, and cultural identity achievement.\n\nUnexamined cultural identity: \"a stage where one's cultural characteristics are taken for granted, and consequently there is little interest in exploring cultural issues.\" This for example is the stage one is in throughout their childhood when one doesn't distinguish between cultural characteristics of their household and others. Usually a person in this stage accepts the ideas they find on culture from their parents, the media, community, and others.\n\nAn example of thought in this stage: \"I don't have a culture I'm just an American.\" \"My parents tell me about where they lived, but what do I care? I've never lived there.\"\n\nCultural identity search: \"is the process of exploration and questioning about one's culture in order to learn more about it and to understand the implications of membership in that culture.\" During this stage a person will begin to question why they hold their beliefs and compare it to the beliefs of other cultures. For some this stage may arise from a turning point in their life or from a growing awareness of other cultures. This stage is characterized by growing awareness in social and political forums and a desire to learn more about culture. This can be expressed by asking family members questions about heritage, visiting museums, reading of relevant cultural sources, enrolling in school courses, or attendance at cultural events. This stage might have an emotional component as well.\n\nAn example of thought in this stage: \"I want to know what we do and how our culture is different from others.\" \"There are a lot of non-Japanese people around me, and it gets pretty confusing to try and decide who I am.\"\n\nCultural identity achievement: \"is characterized by a clear, confident acceptance of oneself and an internalization of one's cultural identity.\" In this stage people often allow the acceptance of their cultural identity play a role in their future choices such as how to raise children, how to deal with stereotypes and any discrimination, and approach negative perceptions. This usually leads to an increase in self-confidence and positive psychological adjustment\n\nThere is a set of phenomena that occur in conjunction between virtual culture – understood as the modes and norms of behaviour associated with the internet and the online world – and youth culture. While we can speak of a duality between the virtual (online) and real sphere (face-to-face relations), for youth, this frontier is implicit and permeable. On occasions – to the annoyance of parents and teachers – these spheres are even superposed, meaning that young people may be in the real world without ceasing to be connected.\n\nIn the present techno-cultural context, the relationship between the real world and the virtual world cannot be understood as a link between two independent and separate worlds, possibly coinciding at a point, but as a Moebius strip where there exists no inside and outside and where it is impossible to identify limits between both. For new generations, to an ever-greater extent, digital life merges with their home life as yet another element of nature. In this naturalizing of digital life, the learning processes from that environment are frequently mentioned not just since they are explicitly asked but because the subject of the internet comes up spontaneously among those polled. The ideas of active learning, of googling 'when you don’t know', of recourse to tutorials for 'learning' a programme or a game, or the expression 'I learnt English better and in a more entertaining way by playing' are examples often cited as to why the internet is the place most frequented by the young people polled.\n\nThe internet is becoming an extension of the expressive dimension of the youth condition. There, youth talk about their lives and concerns, design the content that they make available to others and assess others reactions to it in the form of optimized and electronically mediated social approval. Many of today's youth go through processes of affirmation procedures and is often the case for how youth today grow dependency for peer approval. When connected, youth speak of their daily routines and lives. With each post, image or video they upload, they have the possibility of asking themselves who they are and to try out profiles differing from those they assume in the ‘real’ world. The connections they feel in more recent times have become much less interactive through personal means compared to past generations. The influx of new technology and access has created new fields of research on effects on teens and young adults. They thus negotiate their identity and create senses of belonging, putting the acceptance and censure of others to the test, an essential mark of the process of identity construction.\n\nYouth ask themselves about what they think of themselves, how they see themselves personally and, especially, how others see them. On the basis of these questions, youth make decisions which, through a long process of trial and error, shape their identity. This experimentation is also a form through which they can think about their insertion, membership and sociability in the ‘real’ world.\n\nFrom other perspectives, the question arises on what impact the internet has had on youth through accessing this sort of ‘identity laboratory’ and what role it plays in the shaping of youth identity. On the one hand, the internet enables young people to explore and perform various roles and personifications while on the other, the virtual forums – some of them highly attractive, vivid and absorbing (e.g. video games or virtual games of personification) – could present a risk to the construction of a stable and viable personal identity.\n\n"}

The name of the island derives from the Nahuatl: ōme 'two' and tepētl 'mountain (s),' since it is almost entirely composed of two volcanic cones: Concepción (volcano) and Maderas volcano.\n\nAccess to the Museum is free to island residents and has an entrance fee of $10 USD for foreign tourists to visit both museums and $6 USD for domestic visitors.\n\nThe museum requires multilateral support to increase the exhibition area as well as scientific research on many pieces, to enhance information about the articles and to support scientific studies of the important archaeological area.\n\nDue to the absence of outside interest, its own privately generated revenue is insufficient for its continued maintenance and operation into the distant future.\n\nThe museum has two specific sections in two separate buildings; one is the Nicaraguan Numismatics, and another about pre-Hispanic archaeology of the area.\n\nThe archaeology exhibition area has six exhibition halls over 200 square meters, a two-storey exhibition, the only one equipped with air conditioning to preserve the archaeological exhibits.\n\nThe Museum was founded in 2007 by Moises David Ghitis Rivera, a Nicaraguan philanthropist, on his agricultural and cattle farm on the island of Ometepe. It is the only private pre-Hispanic museum in the island of Ometepe, with a collection of more than 1500 archaeological pieces, which are on permanent display.\n\nOn the first floor of the Museum is the Ceramic Hall, displaying urns, metates (grindstones) and stone tools.\n\nOn the second floor of the Museum there is the women representation, the Pottery Hall, varieties and body ornaments room; the 1,500 pieces on display there have been found throughout the island by different farmers, and others were held privately as families heritage which was donated to the Museum.\n\nThe outer courtyard of the Museum displays 16 petroglyphs specimens, found in the area, 13 of which were found in the Maderas volcano, two on the Museum grounds owned by Moses Ghitis and 1 is of unknown origin.\n\nThe island has many petroglyphs some dated as early as 300 BCE.\n\nUpon entering the museum, in the First Hall, the most striking display is the recreation of a pre-Hispanic tomb; it was found and studied 15 years ago by Ghitis Rivera, 700 meters from the Museum now. During the recovery process, it was mapped identifying location of human remains and the artifacts contained.\n\nThe pre-Hispanic tomb was reconstructed within the Museum; it contains teeth, bones placed in a ceramic vase, a jade pendant, an animal teeth necklace, an eagle head tripod and a gold shaman, hence it is inferred that the remains belong to a very important person of Ometepe ancestors.\n\nThe origin of the gold Ometepe article opens an interesting topic of research, regarding its origin, meaning, etc.\n\n Flint fish-shaped \n\nSpearhead, estimated age of 5600 years.\n\nTripod, this piece was found in the “Finca Los Angeles”, according to archaeologists Humberto Leon and Bosco Moroney was dated to approximately 2800 years ago.\n\nXulo Dog, ceramic figure, these dogs were important, natives fed them and eat them.

Its head Frederick Gates envisioned \"The Country School of To-Morrow,\" wherein \"young and old will be taught in practicable ways how to make rural life beautiful, intelligent, fruitful, recreative, healthful, and joyous.\" By 1934 the Board was making grants of $5.5 million a year. It spent nearly all its money by 1950 and closed in 1964.\n\nThe board was founded in February 1902 and chartered by the United States Congress on 15 January 1903, its object being the promotion of education throughout the United States, without distinction as to race, sex or creed. Beside gifts from several philanthropists, the board received, when chartered, a special gift of $1,000,000 from John D. Rockefeller for carrying on work in the southern United States. Upon evidence that this work would be effectively carried out, on 30 June 1905 he made an additional gift of $10,000,000 and in 1907 a further sum of $32,000,000.\n\nRockefeller eventually gave it $180 million, which was used primarily to support higher education and medical schools in the United States and to improve farming practices in the South. It helped eradicate hookworm and created the county agent system in American agriculture, linking research at state agricultural experiment stations with actual practices in the field. By 1934 it was making grants of $5.5 million a year. It spent nearly all its money by 1950 and ceased operating as a separate entity in 1960, when its programs were subsumed into the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nIt had four main programs:\n\nThe work of the General Education Board had a social side as well. “Corn” and educative clubs to study house management, poultry, preservation of fruit and other subjects directly related with agricultural life were encouraged in various ways, more especially in connection with the girl's clubs. Other clubs of a purely social nature were organized for the promotion of more social life in farming communities.\n\nThe investigations which preceded the gifts of the Board were perhaps of as great importance to the development of education in the United States as the gifts themselves. The Board consisted of 17 members and maintained headquarters in New York City. In 1920 the president was Wallace Buttrick, and the secretary, Abraham Flexner.\n\n\"In our dreams, we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hands. The present education conventions fade from their minds, and unhampered by tradition, we work our own good will upon a grateful and responsive rural folk. We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning, or men of science. We have not to raise up from among them authors, editors, poets or men of letters. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have an ample supply…The task we set before ourselves is very simple as well as a very beautiful one, to train these people as we find them to a perfectly ideal life just where they are. So we will organize our children and teach them to do in a perfect way the things their fathers and mothers are doing in an imperfect way, in the homes, in the shops and on the farm.\" - General Education Board, Occasional Papers, No. 1 (General Education Board, New York, 1913) p. 6.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9556155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9556155", "title": "Hack (comedy)", "text": "Hack (comedy)\n\nHack is a term used primarily in stand-up comedy, but also sketch comedy, improv comedy, and comedy writing to refer to a joke or premise for a joke that is considered obvious, has been frequently used by comedians in the past, and/or is blatantly copied from its original author. Alternatively, it may refer to a comedian or performance group that uses hack material or similarly unoriginal devices in their act. Since comedians and people who work with comedians are typically exposed to many more jokes than the general public, they may recognize a topic, joke or performer as hack before the general public does; as a result, even performers who do well on stage may be considered hacks by their peers.\n\nThe word \"hack\" is derived from the British term \"hackneyed\" meaning, \"over used and thus cheapened, or trite\".\n\nOccasionally a performer will be one of the first to develop a joke about a specific topic, and later on others will follow suit to excess. This renders the topic \"hack\" to new performers, but is not considered a detriment to the originator of the material.\n\nReusing humor can also be joke thievery if it is taken without permission from another specific comedian.\n\nFrom the Catskill and Vaudeville beginnings of stand-up comedy, hacking was common as there were few chances that a performer from one area would meet one from another and a single twenty-minute set could sustain a comic for a decade.\n\nIn the late fifties and early sixties, Will Jordan perfected a caricature performance of Ed Sullivan (incorporating mispronouncing the word \"show\" as \"shoe\") that became the basis for all other impersonators that followed. Soon after, Jackie Mason, Rich Little and others began adapting Jordan's caricature to their own acts. This resulted in many of Jordan's shows being canceled due to other performers doing his bit two weeks previous to his shows at the same venue. John Byner, in turn, developed his own, oft-imitated, version of Jordan's caricature that George Carlin cited as being set up with the words, \"Now you know!\"\n\nIn the sixties, comedy took a turn for the more personal. Comics like Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, and George Carlin were no longer regurgitating joke after joke, but instead were offering insight to their own lives from a comedic point of view. As a result, jokes and persona were largely unique to the performer. Hacking proved more difficult, but also more offensive to the writer.\n\nIn the seventies joke theft became more prominent with the boom in popularity of comedy. The eighties and nineties saw the popularity of stand-up comedy continue to increase. With the advent of pay-cable networks, comics were afforded the opportunity to perform their routines unfettered. With this came a new type of joke theft wherein the first comic to tell a stolen joke on some sort of media became the one associated with the joke.\n\nFor many years, Denis Leary had been friends with fellow comedian Bill Hicks. However, when Hicks heard Leary's 1992 album \"No Cure For Cancer\", he felt Leary had stolen his act and material. The friendship ended abruptly as a result.\n\nAt least three stand-up comedians have gone on the record stating they believe Leary stole not just some of Hicks' material but his persona and attitude. As a result of this, it is claimed that after Hicks' death from pancreatic cancer, an industry joke began to circulate about Leary's transformation and subsequent success (roughly; \"Question: Why is Denis Leary a star while Bill Hicks is unknown? Answer: Because there's no cure for cancer\").\n\nAlso in the nineties, began a nearly universal hack of an impression of Bill Cosby, the style of which was first unveiled by Eddie Murphy in his concert \"Raw\".\n\nMore recent times have seen public rivalries between comics over the subject of hacking. Louis CK has maintained a relatively quiet rivalry with Dane Cook over three bits on Cook's album, \"Retaliation\" that allegedly bear some resemblance to three bits on CK's album \"Live in Houston\". This claim is further complicated by both artists having performed bits on naming kids that strongly resemble \"My Real Name\", a bit from Steve Martin's album, \"A Wild and Crazy Guy\".\n\nJoe Rogan, by contrast has been very open in accusing Carlos Mencia of hacking.\n\nIn 2010, Italian comic and satirist Daniele Luttazzi was accused of having plagiarised many jokes from comedians such as George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg, Eddie Izzard, Chris Rock, Bill Hicks and Robert Schimmel. But five years before those charges, Luttazzi himself told about his scheme on his personal blog: he wrote that he adds references to famous comedians' jokes to his work as a defense against the million-euro lawsuits he has to face because of his satire. (In March 2012, Luttazzi won a legal battle against La7 broadcasting company, which in 2007 abruptly closed his late show \"Decameron\", accusing him, among other charges, of plagiarism from Bill Hicks. Sentence: It was original satire, not plagiarism. La7 shall pay Luttazzi 1 million 2 hundred thousand euros.) Luttazzi calls his ruse \"the Lenny Bruce trick\" after a similar trick played by his hero, Lenny Bruce. Luttazzi asked his readers to find out the original jokes. He awards a prize to anyone who finds a \"nugget\", i.e. a reference to famous jokes: he calls the game \"treasure hunt\". Luttazzi also calls the charges \"naive\", explaining why those jokes are not \"plagiarized\", but \"calqued\", which is a fair use of original material. He uses a joke by Emo Philips to prove that the meaning of a joke depends on its context. Luttazzi's blog lists all the comedians and writers quoted in his works.\n\nIn 2011, one of the contestants on the talent quest television program \"Australia's Got Talent\" was Jordan Paris, whose act was stand-up comedy. His act went well, the judges were impressed, and he made it through to the semi-finals. However, it was later revealed that he had plagiarised his jokes from comedians Lee Mack and Geoff Keith. The television network eventually decided to give him a chance to redeem himself and he was allowed to compete in the semi-final, provided he use his own material. Paris' effort this time was self-deprecating, joking about his plagiarism and his large teeth. The first joke went well, but the rest went downhill. It was later found out that the joke that went well - \"I just sacked my two writers - Copy and Paste\" - had been done in 2009 by comedian Jeffrey Ross, about Brad Garrett, at a roast of Joan Rivers. Ross had said, \"This guy has two writers, their names are Cut and Paste.\"\n\nIn January 2012, Blogger and comedian Troy Holm was ridiculed on the social networking site Facebook for stealing jokes and stories from comedian Doug Stanhope and posting them to his Blog from 2010, claiming them as his own work, including Stanhope's \"Fuck someone uglier than you\" routine, which was found on Stanhope's Acid Bootleg. Troy Holm also plagiarized Stanhope's story of an encounter with a transsexual prostitute nearly verbatim, substituting himself as Stanhope, and changing a few small details, causing a backlash from Stanhope's fans. This catapulted Troy Holm into an internet icon which started the \"Occupy Troy Holm\" Movement. Stanhope commented on the Occupy Troy Holm Facebook page that \"To the few people who seem to think this is overboard...and it is...I don't think that you know the levels to which this guy has been ripping me off. He didn't take a tit-fuck joke and use it as a status update. He's been living my entire life as though it was his, changing some names and then promoting with twitters... Look at his site and most the entirety of it is me, including the comments where he uses my stuff to pass as his own conversation. And on Twitter. So who is he ripping off for that stuff that \"isn't\" mine?\"\n\nHacking is not limited to stand-up comedy. Often entire premises in film and television shows are taken from comics or even other media.\n\nDick Cavett and Woody Allen often cited to each other the many instances of their jokes appearing in television shows without their permission, sometimes even falsely attributed to each other.\n\nAllen's jokes and topics were regularly stolen by the highly successful television show, \"Laugh In\". This proved extremely painful to Allen.\n\nSeveral episodes of \"The Simpsons\", including \"\", \"Treehouse of Horror XIII\", and \"The Italian Bob\" have poked fun at \"Family Guy\", implying that MacFarlane's show is guilty of stealing jokes and premises from \"The Simpsons\". However, the producers of both shows have said that there is no serious feud between the two of them and their shows.\n\nThere is, historically, very little legal recourse taken in cases of hacking. Some comics, however, have chosen to exact their own justice. W. C. Fields reportedly paid fifty dollars to have a hack comic's legs broken.\n\nTypically, the repercussions of hacking are limited to personal animosity. On this issue, it sometimes appears that the offended comics are alone in their concern. For example, on February 10, 2007 at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, Joe Rogan argued on-stage with Carlos Mencia, accusing him of hacking other comedians' work. According to Rogan's account, he had just finished his act and introduced the next performer, Ari Shaffir, as a comedian who opens for \"Carlos Men-steal-ia\". Mencia took offense and walked on the stage. The Comedy Store later cancelled Rogan's shows and suggested he \"take a break\" from the Comedy Store, which was then followed by Rogan's manager (who also manages Mencia) dropping Rogan. The entire incident was filmed as part of Rogan's internet reality show, \"JoeShow\". It was then made available to watch or download at numerous websites, including Rogan's.\n\nJoe Rogan said, \"People take plagiarism so seriously in all other forms of media, whether it's music, newspapers, books, but with comedy, it's like, 'You're on your own, fucker.'\"\n\nThe internet, however, has opened up a new medium for \"outing\" a hack. Websites like YouTube allow users to upload videos and share them with others. This has made it much easier to show evidence of joke thievery in a public forum.\n\nIn January 2012, Troy Holm, an amateur Comic, stole several jokes from Doug Stanhope and posted them to his blog under the guise of having written them, himself. Stanhope discovered the blog and tipped-off his fans who then deluged Holms blog with negative and berating comments. The blog has since been taken down.\n\nSteven Rosenthal and Steve Silberberg have published a \"Guide to Hack\" to help new comics avoid hacking, which references (and gives credit to) an earlier work on the same subject by Andy Kindler called, \"The Hacks Handbook: A Starter Kit\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4758074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4758074", "title": "Hoxne Hoard", "text": "Hoxne Hoard\n\nThe Hoxne Hoard ( ) is the largest hoard of late Roman silver and gold discovered in Britain, and the largest collection of gold and silver coins of the fourth and fifth centuries found anywhere within the Roman Empire. It was found by Eric Lawes, a metal detectorist in the village of Hoxne in Suffolk, England on 1992. The hoard consists of 14,865 Roman gold, silver, and bronze coins and approximately 200 items of silver tableware and gold jewellery. The objects are now in the British Museum in London, where the most important pieces and a selection of the rest are on permanent display. In 1993, the Treasure Valuation Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (roughly equivalent to £ in ).\n\nThe hoard was buried in an oak box or small chest filled with items in precious metal, sorted mostly by type, with some in smaller wooden boxes and others in bags or wrapped in fabric. Remnants of the chest and fittings, such as hinges and locks, were recovered in the excavation. The coins of the hoard date it after AD 407, which coincides with the end of Britain as a Roman province. The owners and reasons for burial of the hoard are unknown, but it was carefully packed and the contents appear consistent with what a single very wealthy family might have owned. It is likely that the hoard represents only a part of the wealth of its owner, given the lack of large silver serving vessels and of some of the most common types of jewellery.\n\nThe Hoxne Hoard contains several rare and important objects, such as a gold body-chain and silver-gilt pepper-pots (\"piperatoria\"), including the Empress pepper pot. The hoard is also of particular archaeological significance because it was excavated by professional archaeologists with the items largely undisturbed and intact. The find helped to improve the relationship between metal detectorists and archaeologists, and influenced a change in English law regarding finds of treasure.\n\nThe hoard was discovered in a farm field about southwest of the village of Hoxne in Suffolk on 1992. Tenant farmer Peter Whatling had lost a hammer and asked his friend Eric Lawes, a retired gardener and amateur metal detectorist, to help look for it. While searching the field with his metal detector, Lawes discovered silver spoons, gold jewelry, and numerous gold and silver coins. After retrieving a few items, he and Whatling notified the landowners (Suffolk County Council) and the police without attempting to dig out any more objects.\n\nThe following day, a team of archaeologists from the Suffolk Archaeological Unit carried out an emergency excavation of the site. The entire hoard was excavated in a single day, with the removal of several large blocks of unbroken material for laboratory excavation. The area was searched with metal detectors within a radius of from the find spot. Peter Whatling's missing hammer was also recovered and donated to the British Museum.\n\nThe hoard was concentrated in a single location, within the completely decayed remains of a wooden chest. The objects had been grouped within the chest; for example, pieces such as ladles and bowls were stacked inside one another, and other items were grouped in a way consistent with being held within an inner box. Some items had been disturbed by burrowing animals and ploughing, but the overall amount of disturbance was low. It was possible to determine the original layout of the artefacts within the container, and the existence of the container itself, due to Lawes' prompt notification of the find, which allowed it to be excavated \"in situ\" by professional archaeologists.\n\nThe excavated hoard was taken to the British Museum. The discovery was leaked to the press, and the \"Sun\" newspaper ran a front-page story on 19 November, alongside a picture of Lawes with his metal detector. The full contents of the hoard and its value were still unknown, yet the newspaper article claimed that it was worth £10 million. In response to the unexpected publicity, the British Museum held a press conference at the museum on 20 November to announce the discovery. Newspapers lost interest in the hoard quickly, allowing British Museum curators to sort, clean, and stabilise it without further disruption from the press. The initial cleaning and basic conservation was completed within a month of its discovery.\n\nA Coroner's inquest was held at Lowestoft on 3 September 1993, and the hoard was declared a treasure trove, meaning that it was deemed to have been hidden with the intention of being recovered at a later date. Under English common law, anything declared as such belongs to the Crown if no one claims title to it. However, the customary practice at the time was to reward anyone who found and promptly reported a treasure trove with money equivalent to its market value, the money being provided by the national institution that wished to acquire the treasure. In November 1993, the Treasure Trove Reviewing Committee valued the hoard at £1.75 million (roughly equivalent to £ in ), which was paid to Lawes as finder of the treasure, and he shared it with farmer Peter Whatling. Three years later, the Treasure Act 1996 was enacted by Parliament which allowed the finder, tenant, and landowner to share in any reward.\n\nThe Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service surveyed the field in September 1993, after it was ploughed, finding four gold coins and 81 silver coins, all considered part of the same hoard. Both earlier Iron Age and later mediaeval materials were also discovered, but there was no evidence of a Roman settlement in the vicinity.\n\nA follow-up excavation of the field was carried out by the Suffolk County Council Archaeological Service in 1994, in response to illegal metal detecting near the hoard find. The hoard burial hole was re-excavated, and a single post hole was identified at the southwest corner; this may have been the location of a marker post to enable the depositors of the cache to locate and recover it in the future. Soil was removed in spits for analysis in the area around the find spot, and metal detectors were used to locate metal artefacts. This excavation recovered 335 items dating to the Roman period, mostly coins but also some box fittings. A series of late Bronze Age or early Iron Age post holes were found which may have formed a structure. However, no structural features of the Roman period were detected.\n\nThe coins discovered during the 1994 investigation were spread out in an ellipse centred on the hoard find spot, running east–west up to a distance of on either side. This distribution can be explained by the fact that the farmer carried out deep ploughing in 1990 in an east–west direction on the part of the field where the hoard was found. The farmer had ploughed in a north–south direction since 1967 or 1968, when the land was cleared for agricultural use, but the absence of coins north and south of the find spot suggests that the ploughing before 1990 had not disturbed the hoard.\n\nThe hoard is mainly made up of gold and silver coins and jewellery, amounting to a total of of gold and of silver. It had been placed in a wooden chest, made mostly or entirely of oak, that measured approximately 60×45×30 cm (23.6×17.7×11.8 in). Within the chest, some objects had evidently been placed in smaller boxes made of yew and cherry wood, while others had been packed in with woollen cloth or hay. The chest and the inner boxes had decayed almost completely after being buried, but fragments of the chest and its fittings were recovered during the excavation. The main objects found are:\n\nThe Hoxne Hoard contains 569 gold \"solidi\", struck between the reigns of Valentinian I (364–75) and Honorius (393–423); 14,272 silver coins, including 60 \"miliarenses\" and 14,212 \"siliquae\", struck between the reigns of Constantine II (337–40) and Honorius; and 24 bronze \"nummi\". It is the most significant coin find from the end of Roman Britain and contains all major denominations of coinage from that time, as well as many examples of clipped silver coinage typical of late Roman Britain. The only find from Roman Britain with a larger number of gold coins was the Eye Hoard found in 1780 or 1781, for which there are poor records. The largest single Romano-British hoard was the Cunetio Hoard of 54,951 third-century coins, but these were debased radiates with little precious-metal content. The Frome Hoard was unearthed in Somerset in April 2010 containing 52,503 coins minted between 253 and 305, also mostly debased silver or bronze. Larger hoards of Roman coins have been found at Misrata, Libya and reputedly also at Evreux, France (100,000 coins) and Komin, Croatia (300,000 coins).\n\nThe gold \"solidi\" are all close to their theoretical weight of 4.48 g ( of a Roman pound). The fineness of a \"solidus\" in this period was 99% gold. The total weight of the \"solidi\" in the hoard is almost exactly 8 Roman pounds, suggesting that the coins had been measured out by weight rather than number. Analysis of the \"siliquae\" suggests a range of fineness of between 95% and 99% silver, with the highest percentage of silver found just after a reform of the coinage in 368. Of the \"siliquae\", 428 are locally produced imitations, generally of high quality and with as much silver as the official \"siliquae\" of the period. However, a handful are cliché forgeries where a core of base metal has been wrapped in silver foil.\n\nCoins are the only items in the Hoxne Hoard for which a definite date and place of manufacture can be established. All of the gold coins, and many of the silver coins, bear the names and portraits of the emperor in whose reign they were minted. Most also retain the original mint marks that identify where they were minted, illustrating the Roman system of regional mints producing coins to a uniform design. The coins' manufacture has been traced back to a total of 14 sources: Trier, Arles and Lyon (in Gaul), Ravenna, Milan, Aquileia, Rome (in modern Italy); Siscia (modern Croatia), Sirmium (modern Serbia), Thessaloniki (Greece), Constantinople, Cyzicus, Nicomedia, and Antioch (modern Turkey).\n\nThe coins were minted under three dynasties of Roman emperors. The earliest are the successors of the Constantinian dynasty, followed by the Valentinianic emperors, and finally the Theodosian emperors. The collegiate system of rule (or \"Consortium imperii\") meant that imperial partners would mint coins in each other's names at the mints under their jurisdiction. The overlapping reigns of Eastern and Western emperors often allow changes of type to be dated to within part of a reign. So the latest coins in the hoard, of Western ruler Honorius (393–423) and his challenger Constantine III (407–11), can be demonstrated to belong to the earlier parts of their reigns as they correspond to the lifetime of the Eastern Emperor Arcadius, who died in 408. Thus, the coins provide a \"terminus post quem\" or earliest possible date for the deposition of the hoard of 408.\n\nThe \"siliquae\" in the Hoard were struck mainly at Western mints in Gaul and Italy. It is unknown whether this is because coins from further East rarely reached Britain through trade, or because the Eastern mints rarely struck \"siliquae\". The production of coins seems to follow the location of the Imperial court at the time; for instance, the concentration of Trier coins is much greater after 367, perhaps associated with Gratian moving his court to Trier.\n\nAlmost every silver \"siliqua\" in the hoard had its edge clipped to some degree. This is typical of Roman silver coin finds of this period in Britain, although clipped coins are very unusual through the rest of the Roman Empire. The clipping process invariably leaves the imperial portrait intact on the front of the coin but often damages the mint mark, inscription, and image on the reverse.\n\nThe possible reasons for clipping coins are controversial. Possible explanations include fraud, a deliberate attempt to maintain a stable ratio between gold and silver coins, or an official attempt to provide a new source of silver bullion while maintaining the same number of coins in circulation.\n\nThe huge number of clipped coins in the Hoxne Hoard has made it possible for archaeologists to observe the process of coin-clipping in detail. The coins were evidently cut face-up to avoid damaging the portrait. The average level of clipping is roughly the same for coins dating from 350 onwards.\n\nAll the jewellery in the hoard is gold, and all gold items in the hoard are jewellery, other than the coins. None of the jewellery is unequivocally masculine, although several pieces might have been worn by either gender, such as the rings. There are one body chain, six necklaces, three rings, and nineteen bracelets. The total weight of the gold jewellery is about , and the average metal content of the jewellery pieces is 91.5% gold (about 22 carat), with small proportions of silver and copper in the metal.\n\nThe most important gold item in the hoard is the body chain, which consists of four finely looped gold chains, made using the \"loop-in-loop\" method called \"fox tail\" in modern jewellery, and attached at front and back to plaques. At the front, the chains have terminals in the shape of lions' heads and the plaque has jewels mounted in gold cells, with a large amethyst surrounded by four smaller garnets alternating with four empty cells which probably held pearls that have decayed. At the back, the chains meet at a mount centred on a gold \"solidus\" of Gratian (r. 375–383) which has been converted from an earlier use, probably as a pendant, and which may have been a family heirloom. Body chains of this type appear in Roman art, sometimes on the goddess Venus or on nymphs; some examples have erotic contexts, but they are also worn by respectable high-ranking ladies. They may have been regarded as a suitable gift for a bride. The Hoxne body chain, worn tightly, would fit a woman with a bust-size of . Few body chains have survived; one of the most complete is from the early Byzantine era, found in Egypt, and it also is in the British Museum.\n\nOne of the necklaces features lion-headed terminals, and another includes stylised dolphins. The other four are relatively plain loop-in-loop chains, although one has a Chi-Rho symbol (☧) on the clasp, the only Christian element in the jewellery. Necklaces of similar lengths would normally be worn in the Roman period with a pendant, but no pendants were found in the hoard. The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones or pieces of coloured glass; however, these were taken from the rings before they were buried, perhaps for re-use. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.\nThere were 19 bracelets buried in the hoard, including three matching sets of four made of gold. Many similar bracelets have survived, but sets of four are most unusual; they may have been worn two on each arm, or possibly were shared by two related women. One set has been decorated by corrugating the gold with lateral and transverse grooves; the other two sets bear pierced-work geometric designs. Another five bracelets bear hunting scenes, common in Late Roman decorative art. Three have the designs executed in pierced-work, whereas two others are in repoussé. One bracelet is the sole gold item in the hoard to carry an inscription; it reads: \"\" in Latin, meaning \"Use happily, Lady Juliane\". The expression \"utere felix\" (or sometimes \"uti felix\") is the second most common inscriptional formula on items from Roman Britain and is used to wish good luck, well-being, and joy. The formula is not specifically Christian, but it sometimes occurs in an explicitly Christian context, for example, together with a Chi-Rho symbol.\n\nThe jewellery may have represented the \"reserve\" items rarely or never used from the collection of a wealthy woman or family. Some of the most common types of jewellery are absent, such as brooches, pendants, and ear-rings. Items set with gems are notably missing, although they were very much in the taste of the day. Catherine Johns, former Senior Curator for Roman Britain at the British Museum, speculates that the current or favourite jewellery of the owner was not included in the hoard.\n\nThe hoard contains about 100 silver and silver-gilt items; the number is imprecise because there are unmatched broken parts. They include a statuette of a leaping tigress, made as a handle for an object such as a jug or lamp; four pepper-pots (\"piperatoria\"); a beaker; a vase or juglet (a small jug); four bowls; a small dish; and 98 silver spoons and ladles. The beaker and juglet are decorated with similar leaf and stem patterns, and the juglet has three gilded bands. In contrast, the small bowls and dish are plain, and it is presumed that the owners of the Hoard had many more such items, probably including the large decorated dishes found in other hoards. Many pieces are gilded in parts to accentuate the decoration. The technique of fire-gilding with mercury was used, as was typical at the time.\n\nThe pepper-pots include one vessel, finely modelled after a wealthy or imperial lady, which soon became known as the \"Empress\" pepper-pot. The woman's hair, jewellery, and clothing are carefully represented, and gilding is used to emphasise many details. She is holding a scroll in her left hand, giving the impression of education as well as wealth. Other pepper-pots in the hoard are modelled into a statue of Hercules and Antaeus, an ibex, and a hare and hound together. Not all such spice dispensers held pepper — they were used to dispense other spices as well — but are grouped in discussions as pepper-pots. Each of those found in this hoard has a mechanism in the base to rotate an internal disc, which controls the aperture of two holes in the base. When fully open, the containers could have been filled using a funnel; when part-open they could have been shaken over food or drink to add the spices.\n\n\"Piperatorium\" is generally translated as \"pepper-pot\", and black pepper is considered the most likely condiment these were used for. Pepper is only one of a number of expensive, high-status spices which these vessels might have dispensed, however. The \"piperatoria\" are rare examples of this type of Roman silverware, and according to Johns the Hoxne finds have \"significantly expanded the date range, the typology and the iconographic scope of the type\". The trade and use of pepper in this period has been supported with evidence of mineralized black pepper at three Northern Province sites recovered in the 1990s, and from the Vindolanda tablets which record the purchase of an unspecified quantity of pepper for two denarii. Archaeological sites with contemporary finds have revealed spices, including coriander, poppy, celery, dill, summer savory, mustard, and fennel.\n\nThe tigress is a solid-cast statuette weighing and measuring from head to tail. She was designed to be soldered onto some other object as its handle; traces of tin were found beneath her rear paws, which have a \"smoothly concave curve\". She looks most aesthetically pleasing when the serpentine curves of her head, back, rump, and tail form a line at an angle of about 45°, when the rear paws are flat, allowing for their curve. Her gender is obvious as there are six engorged teats under her belly. She is carefully decorated on her back, but her underside is \"quite perfunctorily finished\". Her stripes are represented by two engraved lines, with a black niello inlay between them, in most places not meeting the engraved lines. Neither her elongated body, nor the distribution of the stripes are accurate for the species; she has a long dorsal stripe running from the skull along the spine to the start of the tail, which is typical of tabby cats rather than tigers. The figure has no stripes around her tail, which thickens at the end, suggesting a thick fur tip as in a lion's tail, which tigers do not have, although Roman art usually gives them one. \n\nThe large collection of spoons includes 51 \"cochlearia\", which are small spoons with shallow bowls and long, tapering handles with a pointed end which was used to pierce eggs and spear small pieces of food—as the Romans did not use forks at the table. There are 23 \"cigni\", which are much rarer, having large rather shallow spoons with shorter, bird-headed handles; and about 20 deep round spoons or small ladles and strainer-spoons. Many are decorated with abstract motifs and some with dolphins or fanciful marine creatures. Many of the spoons are decorated with a Christian monogram cross or Chi-Rho symbol, and sometimes, also with the Greek letters alpha and omega (an appellation for Jesus, who is described as the \"alpha\" and \"omega\" in the Book of Revelation). Three sets of ten spoons, and several other spoons, are decorated with such Christian symbols. As is often the case with Roman silver spoons, many also have a Latin inscription on them, either simply naming their owner or wishing their owner long life. In total, eight different people are named; seven on the spoons, and one on the single beaker in the hoard: Aurelius Ursicinus, Datianus, Euherius, Faustinus, Peregrinus, Quintus, Sanctus, and Silvicola. The most common name is \"Aurelius Ursicinus\", which occurs on a set of five \"cochlearia\" and five ladles. It is unknown whether any of the people named in these inscriptions would have been involved in hiding the hoard or were even alive at the time it was buried.\n\nAlthough only one of these inscriptions is explicitly Christian (\"vivas in deo\"), inscriptions on silver spoons comprising a name followed by \"vivas\" or \"vivat\" usually can be identified as Christian in other late Roman hoards; for example the Mildenhall Treasure has five spoons, three with Chi-Rho monograms, and two with \"vivas\" inscriptions (PASCENTIA VIVAS and PAPITTEDO VIVAS). The formula \"vir bone vivas\" also occurs on a spoon from the Thetford Hoard, but whereas the Thetford Hoard spoons have mostly pagan inscriptions (e.g. \"Dei Fau[ni] Medugeni\" \"of the god Faunus Medugenus [the Mead begotten]\"), the Hoxne Hoard does not have any inscriptions of a specifically pagan nature, and the hoard may be considered to have come from a Christian household (or households). It often is assumed that Roman spoons with Chi-Rho monograms or the \"vivas in deo\" formula are either christening spoons (perhaps presented at adult baptism) or were used in the Eucharist ceremony, but that is not certain.\n\nThere are also a number of small items of uncertain function, described as toiletry pieces. Some are picks, others perhaps scrapers, and three have empty sockets at one end, which probably contained organic material such as bristle, to make a brush. The size of these would be appropriate for cleaning the teeth or applying cosmetics, among other possibilities.\n\nThe average purity of the silver items is 96%. The remainder of the metal is made up of copper and a small amount of zinc, with trace amounts of lead, gold, and bismuth present. The zinc is likely to have been present in a copper brass used to alloy the silver when the objects were made, and the lead, gold, and bismuth probably were present in the unrefined silver ore.\n\nThe iron objects found in the hoard are probably the remains of the outer wooden chest. These consist of large iron rings, double-spiked loops and hinges, strap hinges, probable components of locks, angle brackets, wide and narrow iron strips, and nails.\n\nOrganic finds are rarely well documented with hoards because most coin and treasure finds are removed hastily by the finder or have previously been disrupted by farm work rather than excavated. The Hoxne organic finds included bone, wood, other plant material, and leather. Small fragments were found from a decorated ivory pyxis (a cylindrical lidded box), along with more than 150 tiny shaped pieces of bone inlay or veneer, probably from a wooden box or boxes that have decayed. Minuscule fragments of wood adhering to metal objects were identified as belonging to nine species of timber, all native to Britain; wood traces associated with the iron fittings of the outer chest established that it was made of oak. Silver locks and hinges were from two small wooden boxes or caskets, one made of decorative cherry wood and one made of yew. Some wheat straw survived from padding between the plain silver bowls, which also bore faint traces of linen cloth. Leather fragments were too degraded for identification.\n\nThe initial metallurgical analysis of the hoard was carried out in late 1992 and early 1993 by Cowell and Hook for the procedural purposes of the coroner's inquest. This analysis used X-ray fluorescence, a technique that was applied again later to cleaned surfaces on specimens.\n\nAll 29 items of gold jewellery were analysed, with silver and copper found to be present. Results were typical for Roman silver in hoards of the period, in terms of the presence of copper alloyed with the silver to harden it, and trace elements. One repaired bowl showed a mercury-based solder.\n\nThe large armlet of pierced gold (\"opus interrasile\") showed traces of hematite on the reverse side, which probably would have been used as a type of jeweller's rouge. This is the earliest known and documented use of this technique on Roman jewellery. Gilt items showed the presence of mercury, indicating the mercury gilding technique. The black inlay on the cast silver tigress shows the \"niello\" technique, but with silver sulphide rather than lead sulphide. The settings of stones where garnet and amethyst remain, in the body chain, have vacant places presumed to be where pearls were set, and show elemental sulphur as adhesive or filler.\n\nThe Hoxne Hoard was buried during a period of great upheaval in Britain, marked by the collapse of Roman authority in the province, the departure of the majority of the Roman army, and the first of a wave of attacks by the Anglo-Saxons. Attacks on Italy by the Visigoths around the turn of the fifth century caused the general Stilicho to recall Roman army units from Rhaetia, Gaul, and Britannia. While Stilicho held off the Visigoth attack, the Western provinces were left defenceless against Suebi, Alans, and Vandals who crossed the frozen Rhine in 406 and overran Gaul. The remaining Roman troops in Britain, fearing that the invaders would cross the Channel, elected a series of emperors of their own to lead the defence.\n\nThe first two such emperors were put to death by the dissatisfied soldiery in a matter of months, but the third, who would declare himself Constantine III, led a British force across the English Channel to Gaul in his bid to become Roman Emperor. After scoring victories against the \"barbarians\" in Gaul, Constantine was defeated by an army loyal to Honorius and beheaded in 411. Meanwhile, Constantine's departure had left Britain vulnerable to attacks from Saxon and Irish raiders.\n\nAfter 410, Roman histories give little information about events in Britain. Writing in the next decade, Saint Jerome described Britain after 410 as a \"province fertile of tyrants\", suggesting the collapse of central authority and the rise of local leaders in response to repeated raids by Saxons and others. By 452, a Gaulish chronicler was able to state that some ten years previously \"the Britons, which to this time had suffered from various disasters and misfortunes, are reduced by the power of the Saxons\".\n\nExactly who owned the Hoxne Hoard, and their reasons for burying it, are not known, and probably never will be. However, the hoard itself and its context provide some important clues. The hoard evidently was buried carefully, some distance from any buildings. The hoard very likely represents only a portion of the precious-metal wealth of the person, or people, who owned it; many common types of jewellery are missing, as are large tableware items such as those found in the Mildenhall Treasure. It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing. At most, the Hoxne Hoard represents a moderate portion of the wealth of someone rich; conversely, it may represent a minuscule fraction of the wealth of a family that was incredibly wealthy.\n\nThe appearance of the names \"Aurelius Ursicinus\" and \"Juliane\" on items in the Hoxne Hoard need not imply that people by those names owned the rest of the hoard, either at the time of its burial or previously. There are no historical references to an \"Aurelius Ursicinus\" in Britain in this period. While a \"Marcus Aurelius Ursicinus\" is recorded in the Praetorian Guard in Rome in the period 222–235, a soldier or official of the late fourth or early fifth century would be more likely to take the imperial nomen Flavius, rather than Aurelius. This leads Tomlin to speculate \"The name \"Aurelius Ursicinus\" might sound old-fashioned; it would certainly have been more appropriate to a provincial landowner than an army officer or government official\".\n\nThere are a number of theories about why the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.\n\nThe Hoxne Hoard comes from the later part of a century (\"c\". 350–450) from which an unusually large number of hoards have been discovered, mostly from the fringes of the Empire. Such hoards vary in character, but many include the large pieces of silver tableware lacking in the Hoxne Hoard: dishes, jugs and ewers, bowls and cups, some plain, but many highly decorated. Two other major hoards discovered in modern East Anglia in the last century are from the fourth century; both are now in the British Museum. The Mildenhall Treasure from Suffolk consists of thirty items of silver tableware deposited in the late fourth century, many large and elaborately decorated, such as the \"Great Dish\". The Water Newton Treasure from Cambridgeshire is smaller, but is the earliest hoard to have a clearly Christian character, apparently belonging to a church or chapel; the assorted collection probably includes items made in Britain. The Kaiseraugst Treasure from the site at Augusta Raurica in modern Switzerland (now in Basel) contained 257 items, including a banqueting service with sophisticated decoration. The Esquiline Treasure, found in Rome, evidently came from a wealthy Roman family of the late fourth century, and includes several large items, including the \"Casket of Projecta\". Most of the Esquiline Treasure is in the British Museum, as are bowls and dishes from the Carthage Treasure which belonged to a known family in Roman Africa around 400.\n\nThe Mildenhall, Kaiseraugst, and Esquiline treasures comprise large items of tableware. Other hoards, however, such as those found at Thetford and Beaurains consist mostly of coins, jewellery, and small tableware items; these two hoards probably are pagan votive offerings. A hoard from Traprain Law in Scotland contains decorated Roman silver pieces cut up and folded, showing regard for the value of their metal alone, and may represent loot from a raid.\n\nHoxne, where the hoard was discovered, is located in Suffolk in modern-day East Anglia. Although no large, aristocratic villa has been located in the Hoxne area, there was a Roman settlement nearby from the first through fourth centuries at Scole, about north–west of Hoxne, at the intersection of two Roman roads. One of these, Pye Road, (today's A140), linked Venta Icenorum (Caistor St Edmund) to Camulodunum (Colchester) and Londinium (London).\n\nThe field in which the hoard was discovered was shown by the 1994 excavation to probably have been cleared by the early Bronze Age, when it began to be used for agriculture and settlement. Some settlement activity occurred near the hoard findspot by the first half of the first millennium BC, but there is no evidence of Roman buildings in the immediate vicinity. The field where the hoard was deposited may have been in cultivation during the early phase of the Roman period but the apparent absence of fourth-century coins suggests that it may have been converted to pasture or else had reverted to woodland by that time.\n\nThe Hoxne Hoard is not the only cache of Roman treasure to have been discovered in the area. In 1781 some labourers unearthed a lead box by the river at Clint Farm in Eye, south of Scole and south–west of Hoxne. The box contained about 600 Roman gold coins dating to the reigns of Valens and Valentinian I (reigned 364–375), Gratian (375–383), Theodosius I (378–395), Arcadius (395–408), and Honorius (393–423). This was the largest hoard of Roman gold coins ever discovered in Britain, but the coins were dispersed during the 18th and 19th centuries, and cannot now be easily be identified in coin collections. As a result, the relationship (if any) between the Eye hoard and that in Hoxne cannot be determined, even if the proximity suggests they may have been related.\n\nSoon after the Hoxne Hoard was discovered, there was speculation, based on the name \"Faustinus\" engraved on one of the spoons, that it may have come from the \"Villa Faustini\" that is recorded in Itinerary V of the Antonine Itinerary. The exact location of Villa Faustini is unknown, but as it was the first station after Colchester, it is believed to have been somewhere on the Pye Road (modern A140) and one of the possible locations for it is the modern village of Scole, only a couple of miles from Hoxne. This early theory has since been rejected, however, because \"Faustinus\" was historically a common name, and it only occurs on a single spoon in the hoard. Furthermore, the logic of using inscriptions on individual items in the hoard to determine ownership of the hoard as a whole is considered flawed. Based on the dating of the coins in the hoard, the majority of which belong to the period 394–405, it also has been speculated that the contents of the hoard originally belonged to a military family that accompanied Count Theodosius to Britain in 368–369, and which may have left with Constantine III in 407.\n\nThe hoard was acquired by the British Museum in April 1994. As the Museum's entire purchase fund amounted to only £1.4 million at the time, the hoard had to be purchased with the assistance of donors that included the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the National Art Collections Fund (now the Art Fund), and the J. Paul Getty Trust. The grants from these and other benefactors enabled the museum to raise the £1.75 million needed for the acquisition.\n\nItems from the hoard have been on display almost continuously since the treasure was received at the British Museum. Some items were displayed at the Museum as early as September 1993 in response to public interest. Much of the hoard was exhibited at Ipswich Museum in 1994–1995. From 1997, the most important items went on permanent display at the British Museum in a new and enlarged Roman Britain gallery (Room 49), alongside the roughly contemporary Thetford Hoard, and adjacent to the Mildenhall Treasure, which contains large silver vessels of types that are absent from the Hoxne Hoard. Some items from the Hoxne Hoard were included in \"Treasure: Finding Our Past\", a touring exhibition that was shown in five cities in England and Wales in 2003. A perspex reconstruction of the chest and inner boxes in which it was deposited was created for this tour, showing the arrangement of the different types of items with sample items inside. It is now part of the permanent display in London, along with other items laid out more traditionally.\n\nThe first comprehensive research on the Hoard was published in the full catalogue of the coins by Peter Guest in 2005, and the catalogue of the other objects by Catherine Johns in 2010. The hoard was third in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for the 2003 BBC Television documentary \"Our Top Ten Treasures\", which included archive footage of its finder, Eric Lawes, and the \"Empress\" pepper-pot was selected as item 40 in the 2010 BBC Radio 4 series \"A History of the World in 100 Objects\".\n\nThe discovery and excavation of the Hoxne Hoard improved the relationship between the archaeological profession and the community of metal detectorists. Archaeologists were pleased that Lawes reported the find promptly and largely undisturbed, allowing a professional excavation. Metal detectorists noted that Lawes' efforts were appreciated by the archaeological profession. The Treasure Act 1996 is thought to have contributed to more hoards being made available to archaeologists. The act changed the law so that the owner of the land and the person who finds the hoard have a strong stake in the value of the discovery. The manner of the finding of the Hoxne Hoard by metal detector, and its widespread publicity, contributed to changing the previous system of common law for dealing with treasure trove into a statutory legal framework that takes into account technology such as metal detectors, provides incentives for treasure hunters to report finds, and considers the interests of museums and scholars.\n\n\n"}

Interdental realisations of otherwise dental or alveolar consonants may occur as idiosyncrasies or as coarticulatory effects of a neighbouring interdental sound.

Areas covered also include epigraphy, papyrology, archaeology and numismatics. The journal is published by Walter de Gruyter and articles are in English, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.\n\nThe journal was established in 1901 as \"Beiträge zur alten Geschichte\" (English: \"Contributions to Ancient History\"). Since the 6th issue, it has been named \"Klio\", after Clio, the muse of historiography. The first editor-in-chief was Carl F. Lehmann; in 1903 he was joined by Ernst Kornemann. The journal was published by Leipziger Dieterich-Verlag until 1944. After a first continuously numbered series of the journal from 1901 to 1923, a \"New Series\" was begun in 1925, which restarted at number one and came to an end with number 18 in 1944. In 1959, the first volume of a renewed series was published by Akademie Verlag (East Germany) as number 37 (as if the two previous series had been continuously numbered), although the journal \"Historia\" had been founded in 1950 in West Germany as a replacement. A third \"major\" journal, \"Chiron\" appeared from 1971. However, the importance of the pre-war series ensured that the full set was reprinted at the beginning of the 1960s, although not in the same format or at the same quality as the original publication.\n\nUntil 1992, \"Klio\" was edited by the government-controlled Zentralinstitut für Alte Geschichte und Archäologie. However, it also published works of Western historians and sometimes included Russian language contributions. Important articles appeared in \"Klio\" even after 1959, but the publications of East German scholars at this time were not always up to date or at the level of international research, as a result of the shortage of money and the enforcement of the state's ideological views.\n\nIn 1993 the journal received a new editorial board.

{"id": "18008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18008", "title": "Language center", "text": "Language center\n\nThe term language center or language centre (or more accurately centers, e.g. Broca's area and Wernicke's area) refers to the areas of the brain which serve a particular function for speech processing and production.\n\nNew medical imaging techniques such as PET and fMRI have allowed researchers to generate pictures showing which areas of a living brain are active at a given time. In the past, research was primarily based on observations of loss of ability resulting from damage to the cerebral cortex. Indeed, medical imaging has represented a radical step forward for research on speech processing. Since then, a whole series of relatively large areas of the brain have been found to be involved in speech processing. In more recent research, subcortical regions (those lying below the cerebral cortex such as the putamen and the caudate nucleus) as well as the pre-motor areas (BA 6) have received increased attention. It is now generally assumed that the following structures of the cerebral cortex near the primary and secondary auditory cortices play a fundamental role in speech processing:\n\n\nThe left hemisphere is usually dominant in right-handed people, although bilateral activations are not uncommon in the area of syntactic processing. It is now accepted that the right hemisphere plays an important role in the processing of suprasegmental acoustic features like prosody.\n\nMost areas of speech processing develop in the second year of life in the dominant half (hemisphere) of the brain, which often (though not necessarily) corresponds to the opposite of the dominant hand. 98% of right-handed people are left-hemisphere dominant, and the majority of left-handed people as well.\n\nThe differentiation of speech production into only two large sections of the brain (i.e. Broca's and Wernicke's areas), accepted long before the advent of medical imaging techniques, is now considered outdated. Broca's Area was first suggested to play a role in speech function by the French neurologist and anthropologist Paul Broca in 1861. The basis for this discovery was analysis of speech problems resulting from injuries to this region of the brain, located in the inferior frontal gyrus. Lesions to Broca's Area resulted primarily in disruptions to speech production. Damage to Wernicke's Area, which is located in the lower part of the temporal lobe, lead mainly to disruptions in speech reception. This area was named for German doctor Carl Wernicke, who discovered it in 1874 in the course of his research into aphasias (loss of ability to speak).\n\nBroca's Area is today still considered an important language center, playing a central role in processing syntax, grammar, and sentence structure.\n\nIn summary, these early research efforts demonstrated that semantic and structural speech production takes place in different areas of the brain.\n\n\n"}

The find consists of three neck torcs and a smaller bracelet, which were located in proximity to each other. They are believed to be the oldest Iron Age gold jewellery found in Britain. Subsequent archaeological examination of the area did not uncover further objects.\n\nOne of the torcs is a smaller bracelet decorated with ornament in the style of Celtic art, and the other three are neck rings. The bracelet and one of the neck rings are made with twisted gold wire, and the other neck rings have finials shaped like trumpets. One of the latter has been broken into two pieces. \n\nThe gold content of the four torcs has been measured using x-ray fluorescence to be between 74-78% (roughly equivalent to 17-18 carat), with 18-22% silver, some copper, and traces of iron, mercury and tin – a mix consistent with other Iron Age gold finds in Europe. The weight of the pieces varies from to , and over in total.\n\nAccording to Julia Farley, curator of British and European Iron Age collections of the British Museum, the torcs were \"most likely\" made in the area of what is now Germany or France, most likely in the period 400–250 BCE (La Tène period). Farley commented:\n\nThe torcs were found by Mark Hambleton and Joe Kania at around noon on 11 December 2016, in a field in Leekfrith that the two men were searching using metal detectors. The men had permission from the landowner for the search. At the time, Hambleton and Kania had not discovered anything of note with their metal detectors besides Victorian coins. They had no fixed plans as they surveyed the field, having started metal detecting as a hobby 18 months before (although Hambleton used to go metal-detecting with his father when he was young).\n\nThey found the first three torcs separately, approximately beneath the surface of the field and around apart. The metal detectorists reported the find to a Portable Antiquities Scheme officer based at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery the next day. The last torc was found by the same men, in the same field, several weeks later.\n\nArchaeologists subsequently surveyed the site, but found no other items, declaring it a \"complete find\". They also found no evidence of a settlement or grave on the site. A missing piece of the smallest torc was discovered by the original metal detectorists on 26 February 2017.\n\nThe find was publicly announced on 28 February 2017 at a press conference at the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Hanley.\n\nAt an inquest held later the same day, the torcs were declared to be 'Treasure' under the Treasure Act 1996. Coroner for Stoke-on-Trent and North Staffordshire, Ian Smith, described the find as \"not quite in the same league as the Staffordshire Hoard, but nevertheless exciting.\"\n\nAs a result of the coroner's finding, the items will be offered for sale to museums at a price set by an independent board of antiquities experts known as the Treasure Valuation Committee, with the finders and landowners sharing the money paid by the museum that buys them.\n\nPrior to undergoing valuation, the torcs were placed on public display at the Potteries Museum & Art Gallery from 1 March to 2 April 2017.\n\n"}

Soon after the split, the electoral label Left List was adopted and this label faced its first major electoral test in the London mayoral elections and London Assembly elections on 1 May 2008. Lindsey German, the Mayoral candidate, came seventh and in both the Mayoral and Assembly elections, Left List received less than 1% of the vote, well down on Respect's performance in 2004. The name Left Alternative was subsequently adopted.\n\nRespect was created in January 2004, using the issue of the war in Iraq to mobilise its vote. Beyond this issue, it attempted to have a broad socialist agenda. Respect allows its members to hold membership of other political organisations and notably included the SWP. Respect's most high-profile figure has been George Galloway, then Respect Member of Parliament for Bethnal Green and Bow, who was expelled from the Labour Party in 2003 for \"bringing the party into disrepute\".\n\nIn September 2007, Galloway wrote a letter to Respect's national council members saying that the party was \"too disorganised\" and \"faced oblivion\" unless it reformed its internal party management. The letter also criticised the amount of money spent on the Organising for Fighting Unions conference and on an intervention at the Pride London LGBT rights event.\n\nThe letter was the opening shot in a dispute in Respect initially between Galloway and his supporters (including founding member Salma Yaqoob) on one side, and supporters of the SWP on the other. However the arguments later began to affect all of the membership including those not in the SWP or close to Galloway or Yaqoob. In particular, Galloway called for the appointment of a National Organiser, who would support the National Secretary, John Rees (then an SWP member). The SWP perceived this to be an attempt to undermine John Rees who was the dominant voice for the SWP within Respect's leadership. A letter from their Central Committee stated: \"The SWP believed that the post was created to undermine Respect National Secretary John Rees.\"\n\nIn the course of the dispute, the SWP expelled three members who sided with Galloway: Kevin Ovenden and Rob Hoveman, who both worked for George Galloway, and Nick Wrack, who was nominated for the position of National Organiser.\n\nOn 3 November 2007, Galloway's side announced plans to hold a \"Respect Renewal\" conference on 17 November, the same day as the planned national conference of Respect. The Respect Renewal conference was an open event and organisers claim 350 people attended. This figure was disputed by Chris Harman in \"International Socialism\". The Respect national conference, which went ahead on the same day was attended by 270 delegates from 49 local branches and 17 student groups, as well as 90 observers.\n\nLinda Smith, Respect's national chair at the time of the split, has claimed: \"The sectarianism and ‘control freak’ methods of the SWP have led us to a situation where Respect is irretrievably split.\" The SWP has attributed the split to a shift to the right by George Galloway and his allies, motivated by electoralism (placing election-winning above other principles). This, say the SWP leadership, led to attacks on the SWP as the most prominent left group in Respect.\n\nThe Electoral Commission refused to take a side in the split and therefore continued to recognise Linda Smith as the Nominating Officer for Respect. This means that her signature is required for candidates wishing to use the electoral label \"Respect\" (and similar registered names) on ballot papers in UK elections. A letter from the Electoral Commission to Linda Smith on 23 January 2008, set out its position on the split, following confusion on the matter from both sides.\n\nFollowing the split, the side that included the SWP (but not Galloway or Linda Smith) nominated candidates in two district council by-elections. They could not use the name \"Respect\" on ballot papers without the signature of the nominating officer. Instead, both had no label on the ballot papers.\n\nThis side in the Respect split announced that in the London mayoral elections planned for 1 May 2008 it would stand Lindsey German for mayor (Respect's candidate in 2004 and chosen as Respect's candidate in 2007 prior to the schism) and candidates for the London Assembly, elected on the same date. It announced that its candidates would contest these elections under a new electoral label, the Left List, since Linda Smith had not allowed them to be listed on ballot papers as Respect candidates.\n\nThe Left List contested every constituency and stood on the London-wide proportional representation list.\nAt the council elections on 1 May 2008, the Left List also contested seats as the Left List or the Left Party, Maxine Bowler in Burngreave, Sheffield. Respect Renewal stood in the City and East London constituency as well as contesting the London-wide list. George Galloway headed the London-wide party list, and Respect Renewal candidates stood under the name Respect (George Galloway).\n\nBoth factions of Respect suffered as a result and together failed to reach the previous number of votes.\n\nThe organisation's website began to display the title Left Alternative in late June 2008. On 10 September 2008 John Rees and Lindsey German resigned from the Left Alternative National Committee. Most elected councillors who had joined Left List at the time of the split from Respect subsequently defected to other parties, mainly Labour, over the course of 2008. In 2008, one Left List councillor defected to the Conservative Party. In June of that year, the three remaining Left List councillors in Tower Hamlets, including the Chair and Nominating Officer of the Left List, defected to the Labour Party as did one Respect Renewal councillor.\n\nThe organisation's website ceased operation in mid-2009. The party deregistered from the Electoral Commission Register of Political Parties in April 2010.\n\n"}

It is approximately west of the town of Poptún, and southeast of Sayaxché. Machaquila is situated on the banks of the lower Machaquila River, which is a major tributary of the Pasión River. The site is in a relatively isolated region. During the Classic period, the city's location would have placed it upon a trade route running from the Maya Mountains in the east to the Pasión River in the west, and ultimately to the Usumacinta River. Machaquila is southeast of the contemporary Maya site of Seibal.\n\nThe site core containing the city's monumental architecture is protected, but under threat from occupation by landless peasants. The surrounding area, where the majority of the residential architecture is located, falls within privately owned farmland.\n\nMachaquila shared a pared Emblem Glyph with Cancuen, probably suggesting some form of joint rule and participation in a larger polity that included both cities. A proposal that Machaquila, Cancuen, and Tres Islas participated in a form of government that involved the transference of the status of capital from one city to the next has not been universally accepted.\n\nMachaquila flourished in the Late to Terminal Classic periods, reaching the height of its power in approximately the ninth century. The rise in activity at Machaquila appears to have been a side effect of the collapse of the power of Dos Pilas over the Petexbatún kingdom.\n\nIn 2004, archaeologists announced that they had uncovered a hieroglyphic panel at Cancuen that depicts Tajal Chan Ahk, the 8th-century king of that city. The high relief sculpture shows him installing subordinate rulers at Machaquila.\n\nThe site was excavated in the early 21st century by the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala in collaboration with the Universidad Complutense de Madrid.\n\nThe principal architecture at Machaquila has been dated to the Late Classic period, and includes temples and palace complexes. By 1984, nineteen stelae had been found at the site. Machaquila is unusual in the local region in lacking both an E-Group astronomical complex, and a ballcourt, which are both architectural arrangements that are often found in neighbouring cities. Machaquila is not particularly notable for its architecture or size, rather for its abundant sculpted monuments.\n\nThis architectural group is a ceremonial complex that includes various pyramids (Structures 16 to 20, and 22). Stelae and altars are associated with each of the pyramids. The investigating archaeologists also assume that this complex includes the tombs of city's rulers. The group was closed off from the rest of the city by Structure 45, which was probably residential in nature.\n\nThis complex is the largest group at Machaquila, and had a primarily residential function.\n\nAlthough many sculpted monuments were noted when the site was discovered, none remain at Machaquila. A few were moved in order to protect them, but the majority were looted and their whereabouts is unknown. Sculpted monuments from Machaquila included 18 stelae and 6 altars, and a series of sculpted blocks. Those stelae that were rescued are now in the Museo Nacional de Arqueología in Guatemala City. The remaining monuments at the site include broken stela butts, and featureless stelae where the sculpted portions have been cut away by looters.\n\n"}

It is set in a post apocalyptic world that mixes reality led to the decay of the society with real manifestations of mythological beliefs and superstitions of different cultures.\n\nThe main plot is presented in a trilogy of graphic novels with illustration made by both artists. The protagonist Luz travels through the universe of Malefic Time and meets different people, allies, enemies and their way of surviving in this broken world.\n\nThe project has been carried to other media (comics, novels, RPG, music, shorts) that much develop different aspects of the universe expanding and making it deeper.\n\nMalefic Time is a fantasy universe where humanity is not alone in creation: there are other creatures, called in many ways over the years, now known as Celestials and Fallen.\n\nThese creatures of immense power have been influencing, manipulating us and waging a war in which each side tries to crush the other. In 2019 the world began to sink: social structures crumbled, the world economy disappeared and riots began due to a disease that began to spread worldwide. It was then in 2020 when Celestials and The Fallen showed openly to the world.\n\nThis is 2033, and everyone has in mind that it is the end of an era. According to astrology the Age of Aquarius comes, a shift to inward development of individuals and the rejection of imposed laws that will strongly influence human behavior.\n\nShe is presented for the first time on the cover of the illustrated book with the same title more than 20 years ago. But it is not until in 2010 when Luis Royo and Romulo Royo retake the character, her story is told and the “Malefic Time” project is founded. Malefic is the protagonist, all the plot consists of her development and in the search for her identity.\n\nHer real name is Luz. She moves through New York City looking for libraries and museums, she knows that there, in the old books and ancient paintings are all the keys to understand this new world and to find out who she is.\n\nIn the dilapidated warehouse where she lives there are hundreds of books and papers that she brings from her walks through the city libraries, all of them with apocalyptic themes, Romanesque paintings books, books of Masons, witchcraft, alchemy, notes of prophets and seers, oriental writings, Aztec and African art, reproductions of paintings from ancient times, Greek mythology or Egyptian hieroglyphics studies. All part of a puzzle about the final judgment.\n\nThe search for identity, answer her questions, the cracks and falls are what determine her. It is a broken character built on the bipolarity between her power, determination, great resolute and combat skills, and her apparent role in the future destiny against the huge fragility supposed by the doubts, questions, and frequent states of obsession, disease, collapse and trance. She is a charismatic character with multiple layers that make her an atypical heroine/anti-heroine through which the deep folds and nuances of the story are known.\n\nThe course of his journey is from New York City to Tokyo and Paris. On a trip of spiritual quest. A road full of mysticism and forbidden topics by the current culture. A symbol of change for the man. An uprising against the oppression of the laws and regulations that govern the world.\n\nThese beings have the easy association with the Angels and Demons in the Judeo-Christian biblical tradition in appearance but are much more. They have been the origin of all gods for all cultures, they changed names throughout history, but their conflict and their intervention goes back to the earliest days of mankind. The first indications of their existence are dated back in the Sumerian mythology (cradle of human civilization) and then extends, altered, contaminated, adapted to all forms of religion in the ancient Mediterranean and soon after to other societies of the world.\n\nThe initial conflict, represented biblically with angel Lucifer's rebellion against God establishes an unbridgeable rift between these two positions that have continued settling their disputes over human existence. Both positions represent two diametrical ways of understanding existence with the following association, among others, these inherent values:\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1699474", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1699474", "title": "Mandorla", "text": "Mandorla\n\nA mandorla is an aureola, or frame, usually in the shape of a vesica piscis, which surrounds the figures of Christ and the Virgin Mary in traditional Christian art. It is distinguished from a halo in that it encircles the entire body, and not just the head. It is commonly used to frame the figure of Christ in Majesty in early medieval and Romanesque art, as well as Byzantine art of the same periods. \n\nThe term \"mandorla\", from the Italian language name for the \"almond\" nut, refers to the usual shape. Sometimes however, especially in earlier depictions, the mandorla takes circular or elliptical forms. Sometimes, also usually in earlier forms, the mandorla is shown as the intersection of two circles. Rhombic mandorlas are also sometimes seen.\n\nIn icons of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the mandorla is used to depict sacred moments which transcend time and space, such as the Resurrection and the Transfiguration of Christ and the Dormition of the Theotokos. These mandorla will often be painted in several concentric patterns of color which grow darker as they come close to the center. This is in keeping with the church's use of apophatic theology, as described by Dionysius the Areopagite and others. As holiness increases, there is no way to depict its brightness except by darkness.\n\nIn architectural iconography, the frame of the mandorla is often marked with decorative mouldings. The interior of the mandorla is usually undecorated, but may contain the symbols Α and Ω or, less frequently, depictions of a starry sky or clouds.\n\nIn a famous romanesque fresco of Christ in Glory at Sant Climent de Taüll, the inscription \"Ego Sum Lux Mundi\" (\"I Am the Light of the World\") is incorporated in the mandorla design.\n\nThe tympanum at Conques has Christ, with a gesture carved in romanesque sculpture, indicate the angels at his feet bearing candlesticks. Six surrounding stars, resembling blossoming flowers, indicate the known planets including the Moon. Here the symbolism implies Christ as the Sun.\n\nIn one special case, at Cervon (Nièvre), Christ is seated surrounded by eight stars, resembling blossoming flowers. At Conques the flowers are six-petalled. At Cervon, where the almond motif is repeated in the rim of the mandorla, they are five-petalled, as are almond flowers—the first flowers to appear at the end of winter, even before the leaves of the almond tree. The symbolism of the nine-branched Chanukkiyah candelabrum may be relevant. In the 12th century a great school of Judaic thought radiated from Narbonne, coinciding with the origins of the Kabbalah. Furthermore, at Cervon the eight star/flower only is six petalled: the Root of David, the Morningstar, mentioned at the close of Book of Revelation (22:16). (In one of the oldest manuscripts of the complete Hebrew Bible, the Leningrad Codex, one finds the Star of David imbedded in an octagon.)\n\nIn the symbolism of Hildegard of Bingen the mandorla refers to the Cosmos.\n"}

At the time of dismantling, the height is 14.2m, which is the largest stone pagoda in Korea, originally estimated to be 9 stories. This stone pagoda embodies the wooden building with stone and shows the appearance of Baekje wooden pagoda.\n\nIn 639, the site of Mireuksa was built during the late Baekje. It is the oldest and largest remaining stone pagoda in Korea. It is an important cultural property that faithfully shows the process of transition from wooden tower to stone pagoda.\n\nThis stone pagoda is called the primitive style of Baekje Stone Pagoda. In many ways, it is considered to be the starting point of the whole Korean pagoda. \nThis stone pagoda with granite is unlike the Silla style pagoda of Silla style pagoda. It is a pile of multi-storied pagoda of three sides in the base of a square partitioned by a gravel stone.\n\nMost of the western side and the southern side, and about half of the northern side are collapsed, and the number of floors is only up to 6th floor. Currently, maintenance and maintenance are in progress. The restoration of the Mireuksa Temple was completed in 1991 under the supervision of the Cultural Properties Bureau at the time of the Roh Tae Woo administration. It was once claimed to be on the 7th floor, but during the restoration, a supplementary material was found to indicate that the tower was a 9th floor.\n\nThe stone pagoda of Mireuksaji was the lower one as the wooden pagoda. The top of the temple was divided into three spaces on each side of the first floor, and a door was made in the middle of the room. Inside the center is a huge square pillar. On the first floor, four corners of the body were erected. It is followed by a double-sided technique of wooden architecture with a narrow top and bottom and a convex center. On the pillars, it was also installed in the shape of square and spear, which is the material that connects pillars and pillars in wooden architecture. The roof slope is thin and wide, and it is raised up to four corners and raised slightly. From the second floor, the top becomes shallow, the expression of each part is simplified, and the roof is also reduced in width than the first floor.\n\nIn 1915, it was repaired with cement to prevent the collapse of the tower during Japanese colonial period. However, in April 1994, the government decided to repair the damaged part because it was not beautiful and there was a risk of collapse.\n\nJeollabuk-do completed the basic process from 1998 to 2000, with the preparation for the repair of the Mireuksaji stone pagoda. Since October 2001, the National Institute of Cultural Properties has begun full-scale maintenance.\n\nThe repair work for Mireuksaji stone pagoda was planned to be completed in 2007. However, due to the fact that it is the largest stone pagoda in East Asia and it is a national treasure, the schedule was delayed and delayed until 2017.\n\nThe Cultural Heritage Administration will restore the first and second floors completely symmetrically, and restructure the third and sixth floors before the dismantling. Members of local governments and some experts argue that the tower must be fully symmetrically restored to the fifth floor to prevent its retention and collapse.\n\nOn January 14, 2009, the National Cultural Properties Research Institute of the Cultural Heritage Administration rehabilitated and restored the stone pagoda of Mireuksa Temple in Iksan. At that time, he found a martial art in the center of the upper surface of the pillar, named Sarijangum(舍利莊嚴). \n\nThey found a small bottle with a height of 13cm and a shoulder width of 7.7cm. As a result of inspecting the inside with X-ray, it was confirmed that it is composed of a double structure of inner and outer box. The variety of patterns and handwork techniques on the surface of Sariho show the excellence of Baekje Metal Craft. \n\nThey also found the golden Sari-bonganki. The Sari-bonganki was engraved on the gold plate of 15.5cm in width and 10.5cm in height and painted red to make it clearly visible. It is written that Queen Baekje donated riches and founded a temple and prayed for the good of the royal family by sealing the Sari in the year of 639. It is evaluated as a precious stone statue material which can complement the lack of research of literature by precisely establishing the purpose of the founding of Mireuksa, It was more notable that there was a difference from the record of Samguk-Yusa, in which the Queen was recorded as the daughter of \"Sa\", one of the eight nobles of Baekje, and that Princess Sunwha had created Mireuksa Temple.\n"}

She is also an intersex activist and writer, and former member of Intersex Society of North America. Holmes participated in the first public demonstration by intersex people, now marked by Intersex Awareness Day.\n\nHolmes underwent a clitorectomy, described as a \"clitoral recession\", at age 7, at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. This surgery was undertaken because her clitoris \"could become erect\", and the surgery has affected her life ever since, including repeated pelvic exams, adolescent sexual experiences, fear of intimacy, and feelings of difference and embarrassment. Holmes describes how clinician \"promises of sexual normalcy are not being met\" by surgical intervention.\n\nHolmes refers to herself as \"still intersexual\" after medical intervention.\n\nA member of the (now defunct) Intersex Society of North America, Holmes participated with Max Beck and others in the first North American demonstration about intersex issues, a 1996 demonstration as \"Hermaphrodites with Attitude\" outside the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Boston. The event is now commemorated internationally as Intersex Awareness Day. She participated in the second International Intersex Forum in 2012.\n\nHolmes is a professor of sociology at Wilfrid Laurier University, Ontario, where she describes her academic interests as sexuality and queer theory, feminist thought; qualitative health research and law related to sexuality and health. Holmes has also extended her interest in intersex issues to other forms of bodily diversity, including disability.\n\nHolmes is widely published, including works that link intersex to queer theory and ideas of compulsory heterosexuality. In \"Re-membering a Queer Body\"' (1994), Holmes describes how surgery on intersex infants is undertaken to make bodies conform to heterosexual norms: \nHolmes also problematizes this link, and in particular concepts of intersex as a third sex. In \"Locating Third Sexes\" (2004), Holmes argues that: \nHolmes also links the medical treatment of intersex bodies to the medical treatment of disabled bodies. In \"Rethinking the Meaning and Management of Intersexuality\" (2002), she argues that the surgical normalization of intersex infants is neither enhancement nor treatment. In \"Distracted Attentions: Intersexuality and Human Rights Protections\" (2005), she discusses the conceptualization of an intersex birth as an emergency, negating requirement for informed consent. In \"Mind the Gaps: Intersex and (Re-productive) Spaces in Disability Studies and Bioethics\" (June 2008) she argues that, while clinicians presume that \"intersex characteristics are inherently disabling to social viability\", recognition of the personhood of the intersex child necessitates refraining from \"aggressive interference\". The research notes trends to selectively terminate intersex fetuses.\n\nIn her book \"Intersex: A Perilous Difference\" (2008) Holmes argues that there is a duty to understand the stakes involved in conflating what is supposedly 'natural' with what is statistically 'normal', and of what is 'normal' with what is 'healthy'.\" Holmes reviews medical literature and popular culture to examine how society constructs monstrosity. She \"singles out\" the novel Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides, \"and episodes of The X-Files for constructing intersex characters whose lives essentially reproduce the social fascination with the monstrous and the deviant.\" In \"The Intersex Enchiridion: Naming and Knowledge in the Clinic\" (2011), Holmes argues that the replacement of the word \"intersex\" with \"disorders of sex development\" in clinical settings \"reinstitutionalises clinical power to delineate and silence those marked by the diagnosis\" and \"that this silencing is precisely the point of the new terminology.\"\n\nIn 2009, Holmes edited \"Critical Intersex\", a collection of essays on intersex issues, including theoretical and empirical research. The book has been described as \"an important book\" (Anne Fausto-Sterling), \"the 'go to source' for a contemporary, international representation of intersex studies,\" making \"contributions that are precise, plainly written and very illuminating... the detail is fascinating and somewhat unnerving... beautifully clear and compassionate\" (\"Contemporary Sociology\"), and \"an important collection\" (Suzanne Kessler, State University of New York).\n\nHolmes has also written on her experience as an activist, including during her membership in the Intersex Society of North America. The essay \"When Max Beck and Morgan Holmes went to Boston\", provides an account of the participation by Holmes in the first public demonstration by intersex people, on October 26, 1996, an event that took place following the activists' exclusion from a clinical conference. The demonstration is now marked by Intersex Awareness Day\n\n\n\n"}

The deposits on site were deep and divided up into six distinct layers of occupation. These have been divided into PPNB aceramic during levels six to three, with later Neolithic and Chalcolithic, Yarmukian and Wadi Rabah cultures in levels two and one.\n\nBuildings in the earlier stages had stone, paved or plastered floors made of mud bricks on stone foundations with remains of hearths and other stone structures. The north walls of buildings contained a plastered niche, a feature found in a similar room in Jericho. The PPNB levels also revealed an unusual circular courtyard structure with rooms radiating out from it and a large platform with channels cut in it associated with a pebble lined trough, presumably used for craft purposes. The Yarmoukian phase continued with round buildings which developed into rectangular ones in the Rabah phase. A major break in settlement was detected between levels three and two, where the early levels were covered over with sandy soil.\n\nVarious flint tools and arrowheads were recovered from the site. Arrowheads had distinctive tangs (some barbed) with wings and pointed shoulders, some were diamond or leaf shaped and a few were notched. Finely denticulated sickle blades were found in large numbers with other tools including end scrapers, blades, burins and borers. One piece of obsidian was found in level six that originated from the same place as a piece from El Khiam. Grinding tools were also found including pestle and mortars of basalt or limestone, polishers, rubbers and grooved stones. Stoneware vessels were found along with a few greenstone beads. The site was also notable for finds of clay figurines of males, females and animals.\n\nRadio-carbon dating of the site had large stated errors due to problematic dating materials but gave dates between ca. 7210 and 5420 BC. These provide a vague suggestion of the age of the site. Typological comparisons have been made of various artifacts highlighting a certain regional variation with more elaborate design arrowheads and less pressure flaking. This equates generally with the PPNB stages of Jericho and Beidha suggesting that occupations overlapped with these sites and a date of occupation during the middle and late 7th millennium BC.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "542377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=542377", "title": "Neuroscience of religion", "text": "Neuroscience of religion\n\nThe neuroscience of religion, also known as neurotheology and as spiritual neuroscience, attempts to explain religious experience and behaviour in neuroscientific terms. It is the study of correlations of neural phenomena with subjective experiences of spirituality and hypotheses to explain these phenomena. This contrasts with the psychology of religion which studies mental, rather than neural, states.\n\nProponents of the neuroscience of religion say there is a neurological and evolutionary basis for subjective experiences traditionally categorized as spiritual or religious. The field has formed the basis of several popular science books, but has received criticism from psychologists.\n\n\"Neurotheology\" is a neologism that describes the scientific study of the neural correlates of religious or spiritual beliefs, experiences and practices. Other researchers prefer to use terms like \"spiritual neuroscience\" or \"neuroscience of religion\". Researchers in the field attempt to explain the neurological basis for religious experiences, such as:\n\nAldous Huxley used the term \"neurotheology\" for the first time in the utopian novel \"Island\". The discipline studies the cognitive neuroscience of religious experience and spirituality. The term is also sometimes used in a less scientific context or a philosophical context. Some of these uses, according to the mainstream scientific community, qualify as pseudoscience. Huxley used it mainly in a philosophical context.\n\nThe use of the term neurotheology in published scientific work is currently uncommon. A search on the citation indexing service provided by Institute for Scientific Information returns five articles. Three of these are published in the journal \"Zygon: Journal of Religion & Science\", while two are published in \"American Behavioral Scientist\". Work on the neural basis of spirituality has, however, occurred sporadically throughout the 20th century.\n\nIn an attempt to focus and clarify what was a growing interest in this field, in 1994 educator and businessman Laurence O. McKinney published the first book on the subject, titled \"Neurotheology: Virtual Religion in the 21st Century\", written for a popular audience but also promoted in the theological journal \"Zygon\". According to McKinney, neurotheology sources the basis of religious inquiry in relatively recent developmental neurophysiology. According to McKinney's theory, pre-frontal development, in humans, creates an illusion of chronological time as a fundamental part of normal adult cognition past the age of three. The inability of the adult brain to retrieve earlier images experienced by an infantile brain creates questions such as \"where did I come from\" and \"where does it all go\", which McKinney suggests led to the creation of various religious explanations. The experience of death as a peaceful regression into timelessness as the brain dies won praise from readers as varied as author Arthur C. Clarke, eminent theologian Harvey Cox, and the Dalai Lama and sparked a new interest in the field. \n\nWhat Andrew B. Newberg and others \"discovered is that intensely focused spiritual contemplation triggers an alteration in the activity of the brain that leads one to perceive transcendent religious experiences as solid, tangible reality. In other words, the sensation that Buddhists call \"oneness with the universe\".\" The orientation area requires sensory input to do its calculus. \"If you block sensory inputs to this region, as you do during the intense concentration of meditation, you prevent the brain from forming the distinction between self and not-self,\" says Newberg. With no information from the senses arriving, the left orientation area cannot find any boundary between the self and the world. As a result, the brain seems to have no choice but \"to perceive the self as endless and intimately interwoven with everyone and everything.\" \"The right orientation area, equally bereft of sensory data, defaults to a feeling of infinite space. The meditators feel that they have touched infinity.\"\n\nThe radical Catholic theologian Eugen Drewermann developed a two-volume critique of traditional conceptions of God and the soul and a reinterpretation of religion (Modern Neurology and the Question of God) based on current neuroscientific research.\n\nHowever, it has also been argued \"that neurotheology should be conceived and practiced within a theological framework.\" Furthermore, it has been suggested that creating a separate category for this kind of research is moot since conventional Behavioural and Social Neurosciences disciplines can handle any empirical investigation of this nature.\n\nVarious theories regarding the evolutionary origin of religion and the evolutionary psychology of religion have been proposed.\n\nIn 1969, British biologist Alister Hardy founded a Religious Experience Research Centre at Oxford after retiring from his post as Linacre Professor of Zoology. Citing William James's \"The Varieties of Religious Experience\" (1902), he set out to collect first-hand accounts of numinous experiences. He was awarded the Templeton Prize before his death in 1985. His successor David Hay suggested in \"God’s Biologist: A life of Alister Hardy\" (2011) that the RERC later dispersed as investigators turned to newer techniques of scientific investigation.\n\nDuring the 1980s Michael Persinger stimulated the temporal lobes of human subjects with a weak magnetic field using an apparatus that popularly became known as the \"God helmet\" and reported that many of his subjects claimed to experience a \"sensed presence\" during stimulation. This work has been criticised, though some researchers have published a replication of one God Helmet experiment.\n\nGranqvist \"et al.\" claimed that Persinger's work was not \"double-blind.\" Participants were often graduate students who knew what sort of results to expect, and there was the risk that the experimenters' expectations would be transmitted to subjects by unconscious cues. The participants were frequently given an idea of the purpose of the study by being asked to fill in questionnaires designed to test their suggestibility to paranormal experiences before the trials were conducted. Granqvist \"et al.\" failed to replicate Persinger's experiments double-blinded, and concluded that the presence or absence of the magnetic field had no relationship with any religious or spiritual experience reported by the participants, but was predicted entirely by their suggestibility and personality traits. Following the publication of this study, Persinger \"et al.\" dispute this. One published attempt to create a \"haunted room\" using environmental \"complex\" electromagnetic fields based on Persinger's theoretical and experimental work did not produce the sensation of a \"sensed presence\" and found that reports of unusual experiences were uncorrelated with the presence or absence of these fields. As in the study by Granqvist \"et al.,\" reports of unusual experiences were instead predicted by the personality characteristics and suggestibility of participants. One experiment with a commercial version of the God helmet found no difference in response to graphic images whether the device was on or off.\n\nThe first researcher to note and catalog the abnormal experiences associated with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was neurologist Norman Geschwind, who noted a set of religious behavioral traits associated with TLE seizures. These include hypergraphia, hyperreligiosity, reduced sexual interest, fainting spells, and pedantism, often collectively ascribed to a condition known as Geschwind syndrome.\n\nVilayanur S. Ramachandran explored the neural basis of the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE using the galvanic skin response (GSR), which correlates with emotional arousal, to determine whether the hyperreligiosity seen in TLE was due to an overall heightened emotional state or was specific to religious stimuli. Ramachandran presented two subjects with neutral, sexually arousing and religious words while measuring GSR. Ramachandran was able to show that patients with TLE showed enhanced emotional responses to the religious words, diminished responses to the sexually charged words, and normal responses to the neutral words. This study was presented as an abstract at a neuroscience conference and referenced in Ramachandran's book, \"Phantoms in the Brain\", but it has never been published in the peer-reviewed scientific press.\n\nResearch by Mario Beauregard at the University of Montreal, using fMRI on Carmelite nuns, has purported to show that religious and spiritual experiences include several brain regions and not a single 'God spot'. As Beauregard has said, \"There is no God spot in the brain. Spiritual experiences are complex, like intense experiences with other human beings.\" The neuroimaging was conducted when the nuns were asked to \"recall\" past mystical states, not while actually undergoing them; \"subjects were asked to remember and relive (eyes closed) the most intense mystical experience ever felt in their lives as a member of the Carmelite Order.\"\nA 2011 study by researchers at the Duke University Medical Center found hippocampal atrophy is associated with older adults who report life-changing religious experiences, as well as those who are \"born-again Protestants, Catholics, and those with no religious affiliation\".\n\nA 2016 study using fMRI found \"a recognizable feeling central to ... (Mormon)... devotional practice was reproducibly associated with activation in nucleus accumbens, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and frontal attentional regions. Nucleus accumbens activation preceded peak spiritual feelings by 1–3 s and was replicated in four separate tasks. ... The association of abstract ideas and brain reward circuitry may interact with frontal attentional and emotive salience processing, suggesting a mechanism whereby doctrinal concepts may come to be intrinsically rewarding and motivate behavior in religious individuals.\"\n\nSome scientists working in the field hypothesize that the basis of spiritual experience arises in neurological physiology. Speculative suggestions have been made that an increase of N,N-dimethyltryptamine levels in the pineal gland contribute to spiritual experiences. Scientific studies confirming this have yet to be published. It has also been suggested that stimulation of the temporal lobe by psychoactive ingredients of 'Magic Mushrooms' mimics religious experiences. This hypothesis has found laboratory validation with respect to psilocybin.\n\n\n"}

The notion of political subjectivity is an emerging idea in social sciences and humanities. In some sense the term political subjectivity reflects the converging point of a number of traditionally distinct disciplinary lines of investigation, such as philosophy, anthropology, political theory, and psychoanalytic theory. Above all, the current conceptualization of political subjectivity has become possible due to a fundamental shift in humanities and social sciences during the 20th century, commonly known as the linguistic turn.\n\nMajor figures associated with the question of political subjectivity come from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, such as German philosopher GWF Hegel, French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, French historian Michel Foucault, American literary critic Fredric Jameson, American cultural anthropologist Clifford Geertz, American medical anthropologist Byron J. Good, American philosopher and gender theorist Judith Butler, Canadian medical anthropologist Sadeq Rahimi, Argentine political theorist Ernesto Laclau, Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek, Greek political theorist Yannis Stavrakakis, and many others.\n\nThe term \"political subjectivity\" had been used in earlier literature, such as Steven Brown's book, \"Political subjectivity: Applications of Q methodology in political science\" to refer to individual political view points as affected by social and personal psychological processes. But the term was later re-appropriated to refer to the much more intricate idea that the very experience of subjectivity is fundamentally political. According to Sadeq Rahimi in \"Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity\", \"Politicality is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject is.\"\n\nAn early (1981) book by Fredric Jameson, \"The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act\", can be considered one of the forerunners of the notion of political subjectivity. In his book Jameson attributed what he termed a \"political unconscious\" to text, asserting that all text has embedded in it, albeit in an implicit form, the encodings of the political history of the environment in which they have been produced. He then proposed “the doctrine of a political unconscious,” as an analytic method for unearthing the hermeneutically repressed political memories of text, and “restoring to the surface of the text the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history” (p. 20). While Jameson's original theory of the political unconscious was primarily a neo-Marxist approach to literary criticism, later proliferation and interdisciplinary cross-fertilization of theories of subjectivity have greatly expanded Jameson's original ideas to include the range of political, cultural and psychological processes within the framework of political subjectivity.\n\n\n"}

This assertion was voiced, although without definite proof, by a number of other researchers.\n\nIn 2015 a number of media outlets reported about a study at the University of Buffalo which analyzed 31 years of data of narcissism research and concluded that men consistently scored higher in the first two of three aspects of the Narcissistic Personality Inventory: leadership/authority, exploitative/entitlement, and grandiose/exhibitionism. The team leader of the research, Emily Grijalva, commented that on average this difference is slight (a one-quarter of a standard deviation) and there was almost no difference in the exhibitionism dimension (which covers such aspects as vanity, self-absorption and attention-seeking). She notices that a similar degree of difference is observed for other personality traits, e.g., slightly higher neuroticism for women or slightly higher risk-taking for men. The reasons of reported gender difference were outside the scope of the study, however the authors speculated that it is rooted in historically established social conventions about what is acceptable for a particular gender and what are the traditional social roles for genders.\n\nA number of earlier studies (on smaller scales) reported similar bias. A further indication for the trend was a 2008 finding that the lifetime narcissistic personality disorder is more prevalent for men (7.7%) than for women (4.8%).\n\n"}

In 2012, Ban Ki Moon, the Secretary General of the United Nations, in his Annual Reports to the General Assembly, titled \"Improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system\" stated that Special Measures are \"procedures designed to accelerate the achievement of gender parity at the Professional levels and above\"<ref name=\"A /67/347\"></ref> and that the aim of these procedures was to ensure \"gender balance in recruitment and promotion\" and rectify \"past and current forms and effects of discrimination against women\" The Secretary General reiterated that Special measures for gender equality would remain in effect until the \"goal of gender parity is achieved, and would be sustained for a period of time\".\n\nGender Equality A/I echoes the goals of, and is in conformity with, mandate of Articles 8 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations, and Article 4 paragraph 1 of the \"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)\".\n\nThe CEDAW or the Convention, also known as the international Bill of Women's Rights, is a legally binding international treaty ratified by 187 States Parties, that entered into force in 1981. All parties to CEDAW, including the UN, are bound to honor it. The UN Doctrine of Gender Equality, and 'Special Measures for Gender Equality' are inspired by and rooted in the CEDAW, specifically in Article 4 paragraph 1, which states:\n\n\"Article 4, paragraph 1 : Adoption by States Parties of temporary special measures aimed at accelerating de facto equality between men and women shall not be considered discrimination as defined in the present Convention, but shall in no way entail as a consequence the maintenance of unequal or separate standards; these measures shall be discontinued when the objectives of equality of opportunity and treatment have been achieved. [emphasis added].\"\n\nThe United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), an expert body composed of 23 experts on women's issues established in 1982 to monitor the progress of the CEDAW's implementation, in 2004, adopted \"General Recommendation 25, on Temporary Special Measures, on Article 4 paragraph 1 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women\".<ref name=\"(A/59/38)\"></ref> The general recommendation 'clarifies the nature and meaning of article 4, paragraph 1, in order to facilitate and ensure the implementation of Temporary special measures and accelerate progress in achieving gender equality in 'employment and professional fields'.\n\nThe purpose of the \"special measures\", which are 'temporary' is \" to accelerate the improvement of the position of women to achieve their \"substantive equality with men, and to effect the structural, social and cultural changes necessary to correct past and current forms and effects of discrimination against women, as well as to provide them with compensation.\" These are not an exception 'to the norm of non-discrimination', but rather 'part of a necessary strategy' to achieve 'substantive equality of women'. The 'temporary special measures', includes 'preferential treatment; targeted recruitment, hiring and promotion; numerical goals connected with time frames; and quota systems'.\n\nThe UN Committee on CEDAW in its general recommendations number 25 commended the Secretary General on his initiative to implement 'temporary special measures', noting \"The use of temporary special measures by the Secretary-General of the United Nations is a practical example in the area of women's employment, including through administrative instructions on the recruitment, promotion and placement of women in the Secretariat. These measures aim at achieving the goal of 50/50 gender distribution at all levels, but at the higher echelons in particular\".\n\nIn 2012, the UN Secretary General drawing attention to Article 4 paragraph 1 of the \"Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)\" assured the General Assembly that Special Measures were temporary, and will \"be discontinued when gender parity has been achieved and sustained for a period of time\".\n\nGender equality in the United Nations (UN), particularly at managerial and decision-making positions at the D-1 level and above level, has been a United Nations General Assembly goal since 1970 and a recurring concern since then.<ref name=\"A/RES/45/239\"></ref> In 1984, the UN Secretariat, in order to better focus efforts to wards achieving Gender Equality, prepared its first five-year \"Action plan to improve the status of women for the period 1985-90\".<ref name=\"40/258. 18 December 1985\"></ref> Since then there have been several Five Year Plans, including Strategic Plans, to Improve the Status of Women in the UN. In 1990, the United Nations General Assembly after years of slow progress, urged the Secretary General to \"accord priority\" to increase \"the participation of women at the D-1 level and above to 25 per cent \" by 1995.\nIn December 1994, the UN General Assembly \"disappointment\" that the targets set in 1990 were not achieved and that women in posts at the D-1 level were \"still well below the 25 per cent goal\", urged the Secretary General to prioritize the recruitment and promotion of women to reach to 50/50 representation in D1 and above posts by 2000.<ref name=\"A/RES/49/167 - 23/dec\"></ref> In Feb 2004, in the context of the continuing sluggish progress in achieving the target of gender parity the General Assembly revised the target for achieving 50/50 goal to 2015. Gender parity in the UN has become a distant goal, and since 2005 the UN has stopped indicating the target year when gender parity will be achieved.\n\nWomen's representation in the UN secretariat, at the D1 level, in 2000, was 30.3 percent.<ref name=\"A /65/334\"></ref> By 2009, the representation of women in the secretariat at D1 level decreased to 26.7 percent; by way comparison the representation in the entire UN system in 2009 was 29.2 percent.\n\nThe representation of women in 2011 in the secretariat at D2 level was 24.4 percent. In December 2011, the representation of women in the Secretariat at the D1 level was 27.4 percent, an increase of .6 percent over a two-year period. At the current rate of progress, according to the secretary general's report, gender parity at the D-1 to higher levels will be achieved after 102 years.\n\nReasons most frequently cited for failure to meet the General Assembly targets for Gender Equality, and slide in women's representation at the D1 and above level, according to the Secretary General, are: [a] failure by some \"entities\" in the \"implementation of special measures for gender equality\", and [b] tardy implementation of five year Actions Plans [para 143]. In 2010-2011 only two out of thirty departments in the UN applied the \"target of gender parity\"[A/67/347, p 46, paragraph 110(b)]. The UN Secretariat, the largest entity in the United Nations system, in which 38.7 percent of the staff is women, according to the report, claimed to be one of them. .\n\nThe Special Measures in ST/AI/1999/9, which has four sections, apply throughout the Secretariat \"for the filling of all vacant posts in the Professional category and above\", including temporary posts. Sections 1.6 and 1.8 of the ST/AI makes clear that special measures \"shall apply to the selection of staff for posts in all categories where women are under-represented\".\n\nThe Goal of the \"Special Measures\" as set by the General Assembly is to achieve a 50/50 gender distribution in the entire organization and all departments, and in all \"posts in the professional category and above, including posts at the D1 level and above. This goal applies throughout the Organization, and in every department, office or regional commission, overall and at each level. It applies not only to posts subject to geographical distribution but to all categories of posts, irrespective of the type or duration of the appointment ..., the series of the Staff Rules under which the appointment is to be given ... or the source of funding. ...\"\n\nSection 1.6 of ST/AI/1999/9 mandates that \"Cumulative seniority shall be taken into account when considering women candidates for promotion, except when it would adversely affect their situation. Cumulative seniority shall be calculated as the average of the years of the staff member accrued in her present Professional grade and in her immediately preceding Professional grade\".\n\nSection 1.8 of ST/AI/1999/9 mandates \"Vacancies in the Professional category and above shall be filled, when there are one or more women candidates, by one of those candidates\" when \"Her qualifications meet the requirements for the vacant post\"; and \"her qualifications are substantially equal (emphasis added) or superior to those of competing male candidates\" (Section 1.8 (i)(ii)).\n\nHead of Departments(HODs) of UN entities are responsible, and accountable, for the implementation of the special measures, and the Office of Human Resources(OHRM), under the Department of Management (DM), is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the special measures .Steering Committee for the Improvement of the Status of Women in the Secretariat (ST/SGB/1999/9), is responsible for monitoring and implementation of policies of gender equality, including \"Special Measures\".<ref name=\"ST/IC/2014/1*\"></ref><ref name=\"ST /SGB/1999/9\"></ref>\n\nThe current Policies for ' appointments, placement and promotion' to obtain gender equality in the United Nations system are outlined in ST/SGB/282 (Policies to achieve Gender Equality in the United nations),<ref name=\"ST/SGB/282\"></ref> and ST/AI/1999/9(Special measures for Achievement of gender Equality), which entered into force on 1 October 1999. Gender Equality A/I is listed under the heading 'Appointments, placement and promotion\" in the Index to Administrative Issuance in effect as on 31 December 2013. The Gender Equality A/I is in force, and will remain in effect, as the UN secretariat has made clear, \"until specifically amended or abolished\".\n\nThe United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women, known as UN-Women, the United Nations entity responsible for 'gender equality', and holding \"the UN system accountable for its own commitments on gender equality\" has also promulgated that the Gender Parity A/I will \"remain in effect until the Secretary-General is satisfied that substantial progress towards the goal of gender balance has been made\".\n\nSpecial Measures have found regular affirmation by the Secretary General in his reports to the General Assembly. In 2011, Secretary-General's Policy Committee, of which all heads of departments (HOD) are members, including HOD of management, decided on \"specific actions\" to \"accelerate progress towards the goal of gender parity\". An important measure identified for action was measures for more effective implementations of Special Measures. The Secretary General in the \"Report of the Secretary General\" to the General Assembly, in September 2012, to accelerate the goal of gender parity, affirmed the following:\n\nThe United Nations Secretariat, in April 2010, superseded the old Staff selection system (ST/AI/ 2006/3/Rev.1) with a new staff selection system (ST/AI 2010/3).<ref name=\"2010/3\"></ref> The new Staff selection system was listed in 2014 with Gender Affirmative A/I ((ST/AI 1999/9)) as applicable law for Appointments, placement and promotion.<ref name=\"2ST /AI/1999/9-1\"></ref>\n\nThe 'final provision' of the new staffing system which entered into force on 22 April 2010 in section 13.3 notes that \"The provisions of the present administrative instruction shall prevail over any inconsistent provisions contained in other administrative instructions and information circulars currently in force\" There was a similar provision in the earlier Administrative instruction Staff selection system (ST /AI/2006/3) as well.<ref name=\"ST /AI/2006/3\"></ref> The UN Secretariat since 2010, citing section 13.3 of the new Staff Selection System (ST/AI 2010/3), has, some times, contended that provision of section 13.3 supersede Gender Equality A/I(ST/AI 1999/9), especially section 1.8 on affirmative action, as Gender A/I is inconsistent with 2010/3. UN Women, the agency designated to implement UN Gender Policy, however, continues to assert, including on its web site, that affirmative action for women remain in effect, and continues to be list it as applicable law. The Secretary General has also affirmed to the general assembly, as noted above, that Gender A/I, remains in effect. As a result of the secretariat's reservation, and reluctance to implement gender A/I, it has been implemented with diminishing enthusiasm, and become a frequent cause of litigation.\n\nUNAT jurisprudence has, in its consideration of unsuccessful male candidates, as well as claims of women under the Organization's affirmative action policies, repeatedly upheld affirmative action provisions in ST/AI/412 and its successor ST/AI 1999/9, as lawful and in accordance with the UN Charter. ST/AI 1999/9. ST/AI 1999/9 continues to be cited as an applicable instrument by applicants, as well as the respondent, in cases before the UN Dispute Tribunal(UNDT) and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal (UNAT).\n\nUnited Nations Administrative tribunal with Judge Sumar Sen as president, in a seminal Judgment on affirmative action, held : \"that the various resolutions for Improvement of the status of women in the Secretariat which have been referred to and statements of the Secretary-General have conceded the existence of an unsatisfactory history with respect to the recruitment and promotion of women that does not accord with Article 8 of the Charter. In such circumstances, the Tribunal considers that Article 8 of the Charter must be regarded as a source of authority for reasonable efforts to improve the status of women. It would be anomalous indeed if this unsatisfactory history had to remain unremedied for an unduly long period. Unless affirmative action measures are taken towards ameliorating the effects of this past history, they will, without doubt, be perpetuated for many years. This is incompatible with the objectives of Article 8, as recognized by the General Assembly. Hence, the Tribunal concludes that Article 8 permits the adoption of reasonable affirmative action measures for improvement of the status of women.\" The Tribunal added that, \"as long as affirmative action is required to redress the gender imbalance with which the Secretary-General and the General Assembly have been concerned, Article 8 of the Charter would permit, as a reasonable measure, preferential treatment to women candidates where their qualifications are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates; obviously such a preference is not needed if a woman's qualifications are superior\". The Tribunal, however, cautioned that affirmative action, however laudable, did not justify any weakening of the requirements of Article 101 (3) of the Charter that officials of the Organization be of \"the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity\": \"In evaluating the reasonableness of affirmative action measures, pertinent provisions of the Charter may not be ignored. The Tribunal considers that, with respect to affirmative action measures, it would be impermissible to view Article 8 of the Charter as overriding Article 101 (3) ... This language unequivocally establishes a standard under which less qualified persons are not entitled to preferential treatment based on gender. The fundamental principle reflected in Article 101 (3) may not be diluted by a desire, however commendable, to overcome past problems.” The Tribunal concluded that, \"as long as affirmative action is required to redress the gender imbalance with which the Secretary-General and the General Assembly have been concerned, Article 8 of the Charter would permit, as a reasonable measure, preferential treatment to women candidates where their qualifications are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates(emphasis added); obviously such a preference is not needed if a woman's qualifications are superior\".\n\nUnited Nations Administrative Tribunal, with Mr. Luis de Posadas Montero, Vice-President, Presiding, reaffirmed Grinblat(1992), and held that \"the affirmative action measure establishes a right to preferential treatment for women whose qualifications 'are substantially equal to the qualifications of competing male candidates'\", and ruled that \"as the Applicant was the only woman short-listed for the post, and as she was equally, if not more, qualified for the post, she had a right to promotion, in the light of ST/SGB/237\". \n\nUnited Nations Administrative Tribunal (Mr. Mayer Gabay, President; Ms. Marsha A.Echols; and Mr. Omer Yousif Bireedo) in the case of an unsuccessful male candidate who challenged the promotion of a woman as unlawful and in violation of his rights of due process, citing UNAT Judgements No. 411 (1988) and No. 958 (2000), recalled its “established jurisprudence ... that appointments and promotions are within the discretionary authority of the Secretary-General”,<ref name=\"AT/Dec/1056\"></ref> and that \"qualifications, experience, favourable performance reports and seniority are appraised freely by the Secretary-General and therefore cannot be considered by staff members as giving rise to any expectancy\". The tribunal held that these \"discretionary powers of the Secretary-General are not absolute. They are governed by the relevant provisions of the Charter and by General Assembly resolutions. In this context the Tribunal notes that ST/AI/412 provides that special measures for the achievement of gender equality within the Secretariat must be instituted towards achieving the goal of '50-50 parity between men and women both overall and for positions at the D-1 level and above by the year 2000. It also provides for flexibility in various promotion requirements in order to increase the number of women considered for promotions, for example flexibility regarding seniority.\"<ref name=\"AT/Dec/1056\"></ref> \n\nThe Tribunal concluded that the male candidate had received \"full and fair consideration\" for the post and that the Organization was not bound by the recommendation of the hiring department. \"The Tribunal held that the Secretary-General \"acted within his discretionary authority in deciding to promote a substantially equally qualified female candidate to the D-1 level post\"\"\n\nUnited Nations Administrative Tribunal (Mr. Spyridon Flogaitis, President; Mr. Kevin Haugh; Ms. Brigitte Stern) held that ST/AI/1999/9 required that where there are both male and female candidates with substantially equal qualifications, \"the female candidate should be appointed unless the qualifications of the male candidate are in some demonstrable and measurable way superior to those of the best qualified female candidate. The Tribunal has chosen to use the words 'demonstrable' and 'measurable' advisedly for, since appointment and promotion decisions are amenable to administrative review under the Organization's internal justice system and under the Statute of the Tribunal, and since the body carrying out such review ... should act on identifiable facts and on evidence, there should be evidence which can be examined and assessed by the body carrying out the review from which it can be determined if the affirmative action requirements have been fully complied with. This is an essential requirement if there is to be a meaningful review and if the policy of ST/AI/1999/9 or other affirmative action policy is to be enforced as an imperative. Otherwise, such policies become mere shibboleths or mere set pieces of lip service invoked in the pretence of achieving their objectives.\" The tribunal concluded that although as a general principle, the party making an allegation bears the burden of proving it, but \"this general proposition must require modification where the relevant evidence is solely in the hands of the Administration and not available to an Applicant, the onus of proof in certain matters should be viewed as neutral rather than as resting on the Applicant\". The Tribunal, while agreeing with the conclusions of the Joint Appeals Board (JAB) that \"since there was no demonstrable or measurable evidence to support a conclusion that the successful male candidate enjoyed substantially superior qualifications when compared with those of the Applicant, a breach of ST/AI/1999/9 [had] been established\" Accordingly, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay the Applicant the difference between her salary at the P-3 level and the P-4 salary that she would have received had she been appointed to the post in question, from October 2002, for the lesser of either two years or until her promotion to the P-4 level, and ordered the Respondent either to place the Applicant on the \"Galaxy roster\" until she secures a suitable post at the P-4 level or to pay her two months' net base salary . \n\nIn August 2012, the Organization acknowledged ST/AI/1999/9 (Special measures for achieving Gender Equality) as applicable law on gender balance, noting that \"The general provisions to give women preferential treatment for appointments are found in ST/AI/1999/9\" and that \"selection, vacancies shall be filled by a woman if her qualifications: (a) meet the requirements for the vacant post and (b) are substantially equal or superior to those of competing male candidates (sec. 1.8)\" The Tribunal Judge Coral Shaw confirmed the mandatory character of the \"rules in ST/AI/1999/9 concerning preferential treatment of women in selection processes\".\n\nIn August 2014, the UN administration conceded in a United Nations Dispute Tribunal hearing that administrative instruction ST/AI/1999/9 (Special measures for the achievement of Gender Equality), was valid in a selection process.<ref name=\"Judgment No.: Undt/2014/068\"></ref> While examining \"whether the relevant sections of that administrative instruction have been correctly applied to the case at hand\", the Tribunal Judge Thomas Laker concluded that the Administration failed to respect provision of the ST/AI 1999/9and rescinded the selection decision, for this and other infractions.\"<ref name=\"Judgment No.: Undt/2014/068\"></ref>\n\nGender A/I, as already mentioned, has often been a subject of litigation. In cases brought before the tribunal, the respondent, ie, the Secretary General, has, so far, not contested the applicability of the gender AI as applicable law. The tribunal in several cases has upheld the validity of Gender AI and cited it in its judgment. A tabulation of the salient cases in which Gender A/I has been a subject of litigation, and judgments by the tribunal, is below: \n\n\n"}

{"id": "15874087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15874087", "title": "Taos language", "text": "Taos language\n\nThe Taos language of the Northern Tiwa language branch of the Tanoan language family is spoken in Taos Pueblo, New Mexico.\n\nIn data collected in 1935 and 1937, George L. Trager (1946) notes that Taos was spoken by all members of the Taos Pueblo community. Additionally, most speakers were bilingual in either Spanish or English: speakers over 50 years of age were fluent in Spanish, adult speakers younger than 50 spoke Spanish and English, children around 5 years old could speak English but not Spanish—generally a decrease in age correlated with a decrease in Spanish fluency and an increase in English fluency. Pre-school children and a few very old women were monolingual Taos speakers.\n\nA more recent report by Gomez (2003) notes that the language \"until a few years ago remained viable only in age groups of thirty and older\", a sign that Taos is being affected by language endangerment pressures. Nonetheless, it is one of 46 languages in North America that are being spoken by significant numbers of children as of 1995 (Goddard 1996). The most recent estimate is from 1980 with about 800 native speakers out of 1600 ethnic population (50% of the population).\n\nTaos speakers have historically been reluctant to provide linguists with language data to work with and have preferred to keep their language secret from outsiders. G. Trager had to work with his consultants in private and keep their identities in confidence. The tendency for secrecy is a continuing general Pueblo reaction starting in the 17th century in large part due to the oppressive persecution (including public executions and torture) of Pueblo religious practices by the colonial Spanish. The Taos community has been particularly guarded about revealing their language (and culture) to outsiders when compared with other eastern pueblos in New Mexico. Due to secrecy practices, the details of language preservation are not known outside of the community.\n\nG. Trager found no dialectal variation in the 1930-1940s.\n\nTaos belongs to a northern sub-grouping on the Tiwa branch of the Tanoan language family. It is closely related to and partly mutually intelligible with Picurís (spoken at Picuris Pueblo). It is slightly more distantly related to Southern Tiwa (spoken at Isleta Pueblo and Sandia Pueblo).\n\nIn July 2012, Taos Pueblo, which \"does not formally encourage persons outside the tribe to learn their language\" hosted a Tiwa Language Festival for tribal members to keep Tiwa from \"going to sleep\". The Cultural Education Committee hopes to incorporate the Tiwa language into Head Start in the fall.\n\nAccording to one analysis, Taos has 18 consonants:\n\nThe alveolar flap is found in loanwords from New Mexican Spanish.\n\nTaos has six vowels—five of these have an oral-nasal contrast. Taos has five (native) vowel clusters (i.e. diphthongs).\n\nTaos has three degrees of stress: \"primary\", \"secondary\", and \"unstressed\", as well as three tones: \"high\", \"mid\", and \"low\".\n\nTaos has been transcribed by Trager in Americanist phonetic notation. However, his transcription differs between his earlier work exemplified by Trager (1946) and his later work following and explained in Trager (1948). The following chart lists the symbolization of Taos phonemes in Trager (1946) and Trager (1948) and also a corresponding IPA symbolization. However, the chart only lists symbols that differ between the three—if Trager (1946), Trager (1948), and the IPA all use the same symbol it is not listed in the chart below.\n\nBoth Trager (1946) and Trager (1948) use the same vowel symbolization. This symbols have roughly approximate values of corresponding IPA symbols except that the vowel transcribed as by Trager is phonetically IPA and in Trager's phonemic categorizing a low back vowel (with rounding details irrelevant to the categorization).\n\nMore different is Trager's two ways of transcribing tone and stress. The table below shows the differences on the syllable \"ta\".\n\nThe conflation between primary + high and secondary + high as well as primary + low and secondary + low in Trager (1946) was due to the belief that they were in complementary distribution. Trager rescinded this view in Trager (1948) and onward. In Trager's terminology, primary stress is called \"loud\" stress, secondary stress is \"normal\", and unstressed is \"weak\".\n\nThe orthography used in this article is essentially that of Trager (1948) with one modification: Trager (1948: 158) mentioned that the glottal stop \"’\" was not written when word-initial in the practical orthography he was teaching his informants—this practice is followed here.\n\nTaos nouns are inflected according to grammatical number with the number suffixes. Additionally, they may be inflected for possession with prefixes that indicate the number and grammatical person of the possessor as well as agreeing with the number of noun stem.\n\nNouns are generally composed of a noun stem with a following number suffix. The number suffixes distinguish between singular and plural. However, in verbs, three numbers are distinguished—singular, dual, and plural—because of this distinction in verbs the plural suffixes on nouns are more appropriately duoplural (Trager uses the term \"nonsingular\"). The singular suffix is \"‑na\" and the duoplural suffix is \"‑ne\".\n\nTwo other number suffixes \"‑ną\" and \"‑nemą\" can express either singular number or duoplural depending upon the grammatical class of noun. For example, the noun stem \"cupa‑\" \"judge\" is duoplural with the addition of \"‑ną\": \"cùpáną\" \"judges\". On the other hand, the noun stem \"t’awa‑\" \"wheel\" is singular with the addition of \"‑ną\": \"t’áwaną\" \"wheel\". Examples with \"‑nemą\" include \"ká‑nemą\" \"mothers\" (duoplural) and \"cí‑nemą\" \"eye\" (singular). Following the terminology used for other Tanoan languages, these will be called here \"inverse\" number suffixes. These inverse suffixes effectively indicate the grammatical number opposite the other suffix that appears on a given noun. Thus, since the stem \"p’iane‑\" \"mountain\" requires the plural suffix \"‑ne\" in the duoplural form (namely, \"p’íane‑ne\" \"mountains\"), the inverse \"‑nemą\" marks the singular in \"p’íane‑nemą\" \"mountain\". And, likewise, since the stem \"cibiki‑\" \"robin\" requires the singular suffix \"‑na\" in the singular form (namely, \"cìbikí‑na\" \"robin\"), the inverse \"‑ną\" marks the duoplural in \"cìbíki‑ną\" \"robins\".\n\nTaos nouns can be grouped into four grammatical classes based on which number affixes are required for the singular and duoplural inflectional forms. Trager calls these noun classes \"genders\". One class requires the singular suffix \"‑na\" in the singular form and an inverse suffix in the duoplural. Another class requires an inverse suffix in the singular and the duoplural suffix \"‑ne\" in the duoplural. A third class requires the singular and duoplural suffixes for the singular and duoplural forms, respectively. A fourth class only occurs with the duoplural suffix \"‑ne\". The first two classes, which use an inverse suffix, can be separated into two subclasses based on whether inverse \"‑ną\" or \"‑nemą\" is used. These are summarized in the following table.\n\nNoun class I is composed of primarily animate nouns. The animate nouns include persons, animals, and kinship terms. Two non-animate nouns in the class are \"c’ìpána\" \"doll\" and \"p’ȍxwíana\" \"egg\". The class includes both native words and loanwords from Spanish (such as \"yàwo’óna\" \"mare\" from \"yegua\", and \"prìmu’úna\" \"cousin\" from \"primo\"). Membership of this class is represented by the following list of nouns (cited in the singular form). The first list uses the \"‑ną\" inverse suffix in the duoplural.\n\nThe following belong to noun class I with the \"‑nemą\" inverse suffix.\n\nNouns in classes II and III are opposed to class I in that they are inanimates. However, there is no apparent semantic motivation for distinguishing the types of nouns with membership in class II and class III. Both classes include body parts, plants, natural phenomena, and man-made materials. Loanwords are incorporated into both classes. Examples of nouns in class II follow. Those with the \"‑ną\" inverse suffix are below.\n\nExamples of nouns in class II with the \"‑nemą\" inverse suffix are below.\n\nExamples of noun in class III are the following:\n\nThe final class IV consists of mostly abstract and deverbal nouns. All nouns in this class only are inflected with the duoplural. They may be semantically either singular or collective. Examples follow.\n\nTrager treats class III and IV as sub-classes of a larger single class.\n\nThe noun class system also applies to some other word types besides nouns. Demonstratives and some numerals are also inflected for number with different suffixes that agree with the noun that they modify.\n\nWhen some stems are followed by the number suffixes, they are followed by a connecting \"‑e‑\" vowel. For example, the word \"flower\" consists of a stem \"pob‑\" and in the inflected forms the intervening vowel appears: \"pȍb‑é‑nemą\" \"flower\". Other examples include \"ȍd‑é‑nemą\" \"chin, jaw\", \"kwían‑e‑na\" \"bitch\", \"łȉw‑é‑na\" \"woman\". However, not all instances of \"e\" vowels occurring directly before number suffixes are this intervening vowel as there also some stems which end in a \"e\" vowel, such as \"c’ȕné‑na\" \"coyote\" which has the stem \"c’ùne‑\".\n\nSeveral noun stem have reduplicated stem material appearing between the stem and the number suffix. For example, \"kò’óne\" \"washing\" consists of the stem \"ko‑\" and the duoplural number suffix \"‑ne\". Between the stem and the suffix is the duplifix \"‑’o‑\". This duplifix consists of the consonant \"’\" and a copy of the final vowel of the stem \"ko‑\". The duplifix may be symbolized as \"‑’V‑\" where \"V\" represents the reduplication of any vowel that occurs at the end of the preceding noun stem.\nThus \"washing\" is \"ko‑’V‑ne\", which after copying is \"ko‑’o‑ne\". Other examples include\n\nFurther details about the phonology of the reduplication are found in Taos phonology: Reduplicative vowel patterning.\n\nThe reduplication occurs in all four noun classes before the all number suffixes except inverse \"‑ną\" (in both class I duoplural and class II singular). The following examples show the patterning of reduplication and number suffixes found by Trager.\n\nNoun stems of the nouns in class I can standalone as free words when they are used to refer to persons as proper nouns.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3709628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3709628", "title": "The Swineherd", "text": "The Swineherd\n\n\"The Swineherd\" () is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a prince who disguises himself as a swineherd to woo an arrogant princess. The tale was first published December 20, 1841 by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark in \"Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection.\" The tale appears to be original with Andersen though similar tales are known. \"The Swineherd\" has been adapted to various media.\n\nA poor prince wants to marry the Emperor's daughter and sends her two beautiful gifts, a nightingale and a rose. The princess rejects the humble gifts because they're real and natural, rather than artificial. The prince then disguises himself and applies for the position of swineherd at the palace. Once on the job, he creates a musical pot. The princess slogs through the mud to the swineherd's hut and pays ten kisses for the pot. When the swineherd follows the pot with the creation of a musical rattle, she pays one hundred kisses for it. The Emperor, disgusted that his daughter would kiss a swineherd for a toy, casts her out. The prince, having found the princess unworthy of his love, washes his face, dons his royal attire, and spurns the princess as her father did. The princess is left outside the palace door singing dolefully.\n\nThe tale appears to be Andersen's invention though the punishing of proud princesses is a stock theme in folk and fairy tales. In Basile's \"Pentamerone\" (1634) a tale tells of proud Cinziella and her wooing by a prince disguised as a gardener. In the Grimm collections, \"King Thrushbeard\" is a similar tale of a royal disguising himself to woo an arrogant princess. Andersen's tale is less sentimental than the traditional tales. In traditional tales, the woman is softened and continues to love the man once he is revealed to be royalty but in Andersen she is cast away and left alone mourning the loss of love and status.\n\nThe tale was first published by C. A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark on 20 December 1841 in \"Fairy Tales Told for Children. New Collection. Third Booklet. 1842.\" and first translated into English by Charles Boner in 1846 who published it in \"A Danish Storybook\".\n\nThe tale has been adapted to various media. \"Les cent baisers\" (The Hundred Kisses), is a ballet choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska to music by Baron Frederic d'Erlanger and a libretto by Boris Kochno. The ballet premiered at Covent Garden 18 July 1935 with Irina Baronova as the Princess and David Lichine as the Prince. The ballet was first staged in Australia by de Basil's Ballets Russes on 5 December 1936.\n\nAn operatic adaptation was undertaken by Nino Rota (1911–1979) called \"The Swineherd Prince\" () when he was thirteen. Britain's only permanent marionette theatre, Harlequin Puppet Theatre at Rhos-on-Sea, Wales, presented \"The Swineherd\" in an adaptation by Eric Brammell in 1958. In the 1950s, Soviet/Russian composer Boris Tchaikovsky wrote a suite of incidental music for a radio production of \"The Swineherd\".\n\nParts of the story have been used in Evgeny Shvarts's 1934 play \"The Emperor's New Clothes\".\n\n\n\n"}

The book was highly praised on release, winning three awards for that year. In 2006, it was made into a musical which toured the UK and visited the US in 2007.\n\nNeil Gaiman has said the story was inspired by a nightmare his daughter Maddy, then aged 4, had that there were wolves in the walls. In the story the protagonist, Lucy, hears wolves in the walls of her family's house, but her family does not believe her until one day when the wolves come out of the walls. The book is notable for Dave McKean's art, which utilises many different techniques, including photography, computer-generated imagery and drawing to achieve its effect.\n\nIt is also available in Spanish, German and Italian.\n\nThe book was very well received, with positive reviews for both the text and art. It won awards for the \"New York Times\" Best Illustrated Children's Book (2003), the IRA/CBC Children's Choice (2004) award and the British Science Fiction Association award for Short Fiction (2003).\n\nIn 2006 \"The Wolves in the Walls\" was adapted for stage, as a \"Musical Pandemonium\" of the same name, with music by Nick Powell to which Neil Gaiman contributed some lyrics. It was co-produced by the National Theatre of Scotland and Improbable theatre, and premiered at the Tramway in Glasgow in March 2006, before touring the UK for the rest of the year, winning TMA Best Show for Children and Young People for 2006.

For instance, the difference in English between nominative \"I\" and oblique \"me\" is governed by its relationship to the verb (at least according to prescriptive grammars), whereas the genitive form \"my\" is associated with a noun: I see the dog, the dog sees me,\" but my dog\".\n\nThere are other situations where a case has been argued to be nominal rather than verbal. For instance, in Latin, a noun may be inflected for case according to its role with an infinitive, which is arguably as much a noun as a verb, and this has been called nominal case:\n\nSimilarly, when a verb is nominalized, its arguments may remain with their original cases:\nHere, as the verb 'likes' is changed to the gerund 'liking', and the nominative 'she' changes to genitive 'her', but the oblique case of 'me' remains.

The journal was discovered after his death, with a covering letter to his literary executor, \"a sort of White Book concerning my negotiations with myself - and with God.\" After the original Swedish version was published in 1963, the English translation came out in 1964, The translation was done by noted Swedish scholar Leif Sjöberg, and was refined by the poet W. H. Auden, who also wrote a foreword. This brought the book immediate literary notice, and even a front-page rave in \"The New York Times Book Review\". It is highly regarded as a classic of contemporary spiritual literature.\n\nA collection of his diary reflections, the book starts in 1925, when he was 20 years old, and ends at his death in 1961. The typewritten manuscript was found in the bedside table of his New York apartment after Hammarskjöld's death in the Congo. As van Dusen writes: \"His last night had been spent in the residency of Sture Linner (), head of the United Nations mission to the Congo. He left there the copy of the German original of Ich und Du (I and Thou) presented to him by Martin Buber and the first dozen pages of his translation into Swedish...Beside the bed was the cherished copy of Thomas a Kempis' \"The Imitation of Christ\" which was always on the table of his New York City apartment next to his bed where the manuscript of \"Markings\" was found.\"\n\nMany of the entries in \"Markings\" describe Hammarskjöld's struggles to view his professional duty as a spiritual responsibility. The entry on June 11, 1961, for example, reads: \"Summoned/To carry it,/Aloned/To assay it,/Chosen/To suffer it,/And free/To deny it,/I saw/For one moment/The sail/In the sun-storm,/Far off/On a wave-crest,/Alone,/Bearing from land./For one moment/I saw.\"\n\nHammarskjöld died in a plane crash in Zambia, near midnight, on September 17–18, 1961. The last entry of \"Markings\" is dated 24 August 1961: \"Is it a new country/In another world of reality/Than Day's?/Or did I live there/Before Day was?/ I awoke/To an ordinary morning with grey light/Reflected from the street,/But still remembered/The dark-blue night/Above the tree line,/The open moor in moonlight,/The crest in shadow,/Remembered other dreams/Of the same mountain country:/Twice I stood on its summits,/I stayed by its remotest lake,/And followed the river/Towards its source./The seasons have changed/And the light/And the weather/And the hour./But it is the same land./And I begin to know the map/And to get my bearings.\"\n\n\"Markings\" was described by the late theologian Henry P. Van Dusen as \"the noblest self-disclosure of spiritual struggle and triumph, perhaps the greatest testament of personal faith written ... in the heat of professional life and amidst the most exacting responsibilities for world peace and order.\" He notes that \"among the approximately six hundred 'Road Marks' staked down along the \"Way' of Dag Hammarskjöld's pilgrimage, almost exactly a hundred are concerned in greater or lesser measure with God.\"\n\nHammarskjöld writes, for example, \"We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours. He who wills adventure will experience it—according to the measure of his courage. He who wills sacrifice will be sacrificed—according to the measure of his purity of heart.\" \n\nThe entry of 4 August 1959 reads: \"To have humility is to experience reality, not \"in relation to ourselves\", but in its sacred independence. It is to see, judge, and act from the point of rest in ourselves. Then, how much disappears, and all that remains falls into place. In the point of rest at the centre of our being, we encounter a world where all things are at rest in the same way. Then a tree becomes a mystery, a cloud, a revelation, each man a cosmos of whose riches we can only catch glimpses. The life of simplicity is simple, but it opens to us a book in which we never get beyond the first syllable.\"\n\n\"Markings\" is characterised by Hammarskjöld's intermingling of prose and haiku poetry in a manner exemplified by the 17th-century Japanese poet Basho in his \"Narrow Roads to the Deep North\". Representative examples include:\n\nThe Easter-lily's dew-wet calyx.\nDrops pausing\nBetween earth and sky.\n\nThey laid the blame on him.\nHe didn't know what it was,\nBut he confessed it.\n\nTrees quiver in the wind,\nSailing on a sea of mist\nOut of earshot.\n\nIn his foreword to \"Markings\", the English poet W. H. Auden states: \"\"Markings\", however, was not intended to be read simply as a work of literature. It is also an historical document of the first importance as an account—and I cannot myself recall another—of the attempt by a professional man of action to unite in one life the \"Via Activa\" and the \"Via Contemplativa\".\" Auden quotes Hammarskjöld as stating \"In our age, the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Both are buried 50 feet below Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, the site of both world's fairs; the 1965 capsule was placed ten feet north of the 1939 capsule. The capsules are to be opened at the same time in the year 6939, five thousand years after the first capsule was sealed.\n\nThe time capsules are bullet-shaped, measure in length, and have an exterior casing of about in diameter. Time Capsule I weighs about , while Time Capsule II weighs about .\n\nTime Capsule I was made of a non-ferrous alloy called Cupaloy, created especially for this project. Designed to resist corrosion for 5,000 years, the alloy was made of 99.4% copper, 0.5% chromium, and 0.1% silver. Westinghouse claims that Cupaloy has the same strength as steel, yet will resist most corrosion over thousands of years because it becomes an anode in electrolytic reactions, receiving deposits instead of wasting away like most iron-bearing metals. Time Capsule II was made of a stainless steel metal called Kromarc, supplied by U.S. Steel. Westinghouse Research Laboratories determined, with extensive chemical testing, that this new super-stainless steel alloy would resist corrosion, much like the alloy used for Time Capsule I. Invented by Frederick Charles Hull,> Kromarc 55 stainless steel is composed of 52.60% iron, 21.24% nickel, 15.43% chromium, 8.20% manganese, 2.15% molybdenum, 0.22% silicon, 0.05% carbon, 0.013% phosphorus, and 0.012% sulfur.\n\nThe contents of the time capsules were sealed inside an insulated, airtight, glass envelope with an interior diameter of and a length of about . The interior of the glass envelope of Capsule I was filled with nitrogen, whereas Capsule II was filled with the inert gas, argon. The term \"time capsule\" was coined by George Edward Pendray for the 1939 World's Fair Westinghouse exhibit in New York.\n\nAmong the 35 small, everyday items placed inside Time Capsule I were a fountain pen and an alphabet block set. Time Capsule I also contained 75 types of fabrics, metals, and plastics. Modern literature, contemporary art, and news events of the twentieth century were recorded on a microfilm \"Micro-File\" for placement in Time Capsule I; the \"Micro-File\" holds over ten million words and a thousand pictures, and has a small microscope for viewing. There are also instructions included on how to make both a large microfilm viewer and a motion picture projector for the newsreels.\n\nAlso included in the capsule were copies of \"Life\" magazine, a kewpie doll, one dollar in change, a pack of Camel cigarettes, a 15-minute RKO Pathe Pictures newsreel, a Lilly Daché hat, and millions of words of text put on microfilm rolls which included a Sears Roebuck catalog, a dictionary, and an almanac. A variety of seeds were placed in the time capsule including wheat, corn, oats, tobacco, cotton, flax, rice, soy beans, alfalfa, sugar beets, carrots, and barley.\n\nThe items in the capsule were selected to chronicle 20th-century life in the United States. During packaging of the contents, under the direction of representatives of the United States National Bureau of Standards, each object was examined to determine whether it could be expected to last 5,000 years. In addition, care was taken to select items that are not interactive and do not decompose into harmful gases or acids. Organic items (for example, seeds) were placed in sealed glass vials.\n\nFive categories of objects were placed inside Capsule I:\n\nFive main categories of objects were placed in Capsule II:\n\nThe \"other\" category included images of a guest book signed by visitors to the Westinghouse pavilion at the 1964 fair. Signers received tin pins, about across (roughly the size of an American fifty-cent piece), stating, \"My name is in the Westinghouse Time Capsule for the next 5,000 years.\" The book's pages were photographed onto acetate microfilm and placed into the time capsule. An exact duplicate of the capsule's articles resides at the Heinz History Center beside a replica capsule of Time Capsule I.\n\nThe contents of Time Capsule I were recorded in a \"Book of Record of the Time Capsule of Cupaloy\". The purpose of this book is to preserve knowledge of the existence of the time capsule for 5,000 years, and to provide assistance to the people of the year 6939 in locating and recovering it. More than 3000 copies of the book were distributed to museums, monasteries, and libraries worldwide. In order to avoid confusion about the 1965 time capsule, a supplement announcing Time Capsule II was sent to the original 3,000 depositories of the 1938 edition.\n\nIf present-day methods of determining time are lost, future generations will be able to calculate the age of the time capsules using astronomical data. In the year 1939, there were two eclipses of the moon, falling on the third of May and the twenty-eighth of October. There were also two eclipses of the sun, an annular eclipse on the nineteenth of April, the path of annular eclipse grazing the North Pole of the earth, and a total eclipse on the twelfth of October, the total path crossing near the South Pole. The heliocentric longitudes of the planets on the first of January at zero-hours Greenwich time were as follows:\n\n\ndegrees\n\nminutes\n\nseconds\nThe mean position of the North Star Polaris (Alpha Ursae Minoris) on the first of January was Right Ascension, 1 hour, 41 minutes, 59 seconds; North Polar distance, 1 degree, 1 minute, and 33.8 seconds. Astronomers of the early twentieth century determined that such a combination of astronomical events is unlikely to recur for many thousands of years. It is thought that this information will allow people of the future to determine the number of years that have elapsed since the capsule was buried by computing backward from their time.\n\nTime Capsule I was lowered at noon on September 23, 1938, the precise moment of the Autumnal Equinox. The latitude and longitude coordinates of its burying place, as determined by the U.S. National Geodetic Survey, was recorded in the \"Book of Record\" as within an ). The time capsule will likely move vertically or horizontally for geological reasons, so an alternate electromagnetic field method was provided. This method involves constructing a loop of wire in diameter and putting an alternating current (between 1,000 and 5,000 hertz) through it with a power of at least 200 watts. A secondary loop of wire, about in diameter, will detect a \"distortion field\", thus indicating the exact location of the two metal alloy time capsules, assuming no other large metal objects are in the vicinity.\n\nAt the close of the 1965 World's Fair, a seven-ton \"permanent sentinel\" granite monument, made by the Rock of Ages Corporation, was installed. The shaft was filled using pitch, concrete and earth, and the monument placed to mark the position where the two time capsules are buried.\n\nThe \"Book of Record\", a copy of which was microfilmed and put inside Time Capsule I, contains written messages from three important men of the time:\n\nAlbert Einstein's message,\n\"Our time is rich in inventive minds, the inventions of which could facilitate our lives considerably. We are crossing the seas by power and utilise power also in order to relieve humanity from all tiring muscular work. We have learned to fly and we are able to send messages and news without any difficulty over the entire world through electric waves. However, the production and distribution of commodities is entirely unorganised so that everybody must live in fear of being eliminated from the economic cycle, in this way suffering for the want of everything. Further more, people living in different countries kill each other at irregular time intervals, so that also for this reason any one who thinks about the future must live in fear and terror. This is due to the fact that the intelligence and character of the masses are incomparably lower than the intelligence and character of the few who produce some thing valuable for the community. I trust that posterity will read these statements with a feeling of proud and justified superiority.\"\nRobert Andrews Millikan's message,\n\"At this moment, August 22, 1938, the principles of representative ballot government, such as are represented by the governments of the Anglo-Saxon, French, and Scandinavian countries, are in deadly conflict with the principles of despotism, which up to two centuries ago had controlled the destiny of man throughout practically the whole of recorded history. If the rational, scientific, progressive principles win out in this struggle there is a possibility of a warless, golden age ahead for mankind. If the reactionary principles of despotism triumph now and in the future, the future history of mankind will repeat the sad story of war and oppression as in the past.\"\nThomas Mann's message,\n\"We know now that the idea of the future as a \"better world\" was a fallacy of the doctrine of progress. The hopes we center on you, citizens of the future, are in no way exaggerated. In broad outline, you will actually resemble us very much as we resemble those who lived a thousand, or five thousand, years ago. Among you too the spirit will fare badly. It should never fare too well on this earth, otherwise men would need it no longer. That optimistic conception of the future is a projection into time of an endeavor which does not belong to the temporal world, the endeavor on the part of man to approximate to his idea of himself, the humanization of man. What we, in this year of Our Lord 1938, understand by the term \"culture\" a notion held in small esteem today by certain nations of the western world is simply this endeavor. What we call the spirit is identical with it, too. Brothers of the future, united with us in the spirit and in this endeavor, we send our greetings.\"\nThe exterior of the 1938 time capsule is die-stamped with this message to anyone that might stumble upon it prior to the scheduled opening year of 6939.\n\nThe 1965 time capsule exterior has no message.\n\nThe \"Book of Record\" requests that its contents be translated into new languages as they develop. It contains a key with illustrations devised by Dr. John P. Harrington of the Smithsonian Institution to help future archaeologists with the English language, since it was felt that existing languages could be lost. It also includes an illustration showing exactly where each of the 33 sounds of 1938 English are formed in the oral cavity in what Dr. Harrington refers to as a \"mouth map.\"\n\n\n\n"}
