The names given are typical, but usage varies; the same tale type number may be referred to by its central motif or by one of the variant folktales of that type, which can also vary, especially when used in different countries and cultures. The tale type does not have to be accurate for every folktale. For example, \"The Cat as Helper\" (545B) also includes tales where a fox helps the hero. Closely related folktales are often grouped within a type. For example, tale types 400–424 all feature brides or wives as the primary protagonist, for instance \"The Quest for a Lost Bride\" (400) or the \"Animal Bride\" (402). Subtypes within a tale type are designated by the addition of a letter to the AT number, for instance: the \"Persecuted Heroine\" (510) has subtypes 510A, \"Cinderella\", and 510B, \"Catskin\" .\n\nAntti Aarne was a student of Julius Krohn and his son Kaarle Krohn. Aarne developed their historic-geographic method of comparative folkloristics, and developed the initial version of what became the Aarne–Thompson tale type index for classifying folktales, first published in 1910.\n\nThe American folklorist Stith Thompson translated Aarne's motif-based classification system in 1928, enlarging its scope. With Thompson's second revisions to Aarne's catalogue in 1961, he created the \"AT number system\" (also referred to as \"AaTh system\"), which is often used today, more commonly in its updated \"ATU number\" form. According to D. L. Ashliman, \"The Aarne–Thompson system catalogues some 2500 basic plots from which, for countless generations, European and Near Eastern storytellers have built their tales\".\n\nThe AT-number system was updated and expanded in 2004 with the publication of \"The Types of International Folktales: A Classification and Bibliography\" by Hans-Jörg Uther. Uther noted that many of the earlier descriptions were cursory and often imprecise, that many \"irregular types\" are in fact old and widespread, and that \"emphasis on oral tradition\" often obscured \"older, written versions of the tale types\". To remedy these shortcomings Uther developed the Aarne–Thompson–Uther classification (ATU) system and included more tales from eastern and southern Europe as well as \"smaller narrative forms\" in this expanded listing.\n\nThe Aarne–Thompson \"Motif-Index of Folk-Literature\" organizes thousands of motifs into a similar system. Entries are first organized by an umbrella topic (for example, category S is \"Unnatural Cruelty\"). Entries are then divided into more specific subcategories. For example, entry S50 \"Cruel relatives-in-law\", under which is the more specific entry S51.1 \"Cruel mother-in-law plans death of daughter-in-law\".\n\nIn his essay \"The Motif-Index and the Tale Type Index: A Critique\", Alan Dundes explains that the Aarne–Thompson indexes are some of the \"most valuable tools in the professional folklorist's arsenal of aids for analysis\".\n\nThe tale type index was criticized by Vladimir Propp of the Formalist school of the 1920s for ignoring the of the motifs by which they are classified. Furthermore, Propp contended that using a \"macro-level\" analysis means that the stories that share motifs might not be classified together, while stories with wide divergences may be grouped under one tale type because the index must select some features as salient. He also observed that while the distinction between animal tales and tales of the fantastic was basically correct—no one would classify Tsarevitch Ivan, the Fire Bird and the Gray Wolf an animal tale because of the wolf—it did raise questions because animal tales often contained fantastic elements, and tales of the fantastic often contained animals; indeed a tale could shift categories if a peasant deceived a bear rather than a devil.\n\nIn describing the motivation for his work, Uther presents several criticisms of the original index. He points out that Thompson's focus on oral tradition sometimes neglects older versions of stories, even when written records exist, that the distribution of stories is uneven (with Eastern and Southern European as well as many other regions' folktale types being under-represented), and that some included folktale types have dubious importance. Similarly, Thompson had noted that the tale type index might well be called \"The Types of the Folk-Tales of Europe, West Asia, and the Lands Settled by these Peoples\". However, Alan Dundes notes that in spite of the flaws of tale type indexes (e. g., typos, redundancies, censorship, etc.; p. 198), \"they represent the keystones for the comparative method in folkloristics, a method which despite postmodern naysayers ... continues to be the hallmark of international folkloristics\" (p. 200).\n\nA quantitative study, published by folklorist Sara Graça da Silva and anthropologist Jamshid J. Tehrani in 2016, tried to evaluate the time of emergence for the \"Tales of Magic\" (ATU 300–ATU 749), based on a phylogenetic model. They found four of them to belong to the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) stratum of magic tales, namely:\n\n\nTen more magic tales were found to be current throughout the Western branch of the Indo-European languages, comprising the main European language families derived from PIE (i. e. Balto-Slavic, Germanic and Italo-Celtic):\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36627400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36627400", "title": "Alexander Potebnja", "text": "Alexander Potebnja\n\nAlexander Potebnja (; ) was a Ukrainian philosopher and linguist active in the Russian Empire, who was a professor of linguistics at the University of Kharkov. He is well known as a specialist in the evolution of Russian phonetics. He also translated part of Homer's Odyssey into Ukrainian. He constructed a theory of language and consciousness that later influenced the thinking of his countryman the Psychologist Lev Vygotsky. His main work was \"Language and Thought\" (\"mysl' i jazyk\") (1862). he was a corresponding member of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences, the foremost academic institution in the Russian Empire.\n\nAlexander Potebnja was born into a noble family in 1835 on his family's khutir Manev, near the village of Havrylivka in Romny county, Poltava oblast . He received his primary education in the Polish school of the city of Radom. He studied law, history, and philology at Kharkiv University (PH D, 1874). In the early 1860s he was active in the Ukrainophile Kharkiv hromada, wrote a Ukrainian primer for Sunday schools, and took part in folklore expeditions in Poltava and Okhtyrka counties. His teachers were the brothers Peter and Nikolai Lavrov and Professor Ambrose Metlinsky. He graduated from the University in 1856, served briefly a teacher of literature at a school in Kharkiv, and then in 1861 he defended his master thesis \"Certain characters in the Slavic folk poetry,\" before beginning to lecture at the University of Kharkiv. In 1862 he published his work \"Thought and Language\", and in the same year he went on a trip abroad. He attended lectures at the University of Berlin, he studied Sanskrit and visited several Slavic countries. In 1874 he defended his doctoral dissertation entitled \"Notes on Russian Grammar\". In 1875, he became a professor at Kharkiv University. He also presided over the Kharkiv Historical-Philological Society (1877–90) and was a member of the Czech Scientific Society (from 1887).\n\nAs a linguist Potebnja specialized in four areas: the philosophy of language, the historical phonetics of the East Slavic languages, etymology, and Slavic historical syntax. His major works on the philosophy of language are \"Mysl’ i iazyk\" (Thought and Language, 5 edns, 1862, 1892, 1913, 1922, 1926); \"O sviazi nekotorykh predstavlenii v iazyke\" (On the Relation among Some Representations in Language, 1864); his doctoral dissertation, \"Iz zapisok po russkoi grammatike\" (From Notes on Russian Grammar, vol 1, 1874; repr 1958); and the posthumously published ‘\"Iazyk i narodnost\"’ (Language and Nationality, in \"Vestnik Evropy\", 1895). He was particularly interested in the relations among language, thought, and reality. Language for him was primarily the means by which the mind ordered the influx of impressions and stimuli. Words carry not only a meaning, but also the past experience of the individual and the nation, through which all new experience is filtered. Thus a word usually has three aspects: an external form, a meaning, and an internal form. It is through the internal form that the objective world is subjectivized. In many cases the internal form is rooted in myth and, hence, acts as a bridge between language and folklore (with its symbols). These ideas constitute the framework of Potebnja's master's thesis, \"O nekotorykh simvolakh v slavianskoi narodnoi poezii\" (On Some Symbols in Slavic Folk Poetry, 1860; expanded edn 1914), and his monumental work \"Obiasneniia malorusskikh i srodnykh narodnykh pesen\" (Explanations of Little Russian and Related Folk Songs, 2 vols, 1883, 1887). With time the consciousness of a word's internal form fades, and one of the tasks of literature is to restore this consciousness. According to this theory, literature is a hierarchy of genres; the simplest ones (the proverb, riddle, and fable) directly recall or renew the word's internal form, and the other genres do so in a more complicated, sometimes hardly detectable, way through a complex system of subjective (in poetry) or seemingly objective (in the novel) images. Potebnia's principal works on this subject were published posthumously: \"Iz lektsii po teorii slovesnosti: Basnia, poslovitsa, pogovorka\" (From Lectures on the Theory of Literature: The Fable, the Adage, the Proverb, 1894; repr 1970; Ukrainian trans 1930), \"Iz zapisok po teorii slovesnosti: Poeziia i proza, tropy i figury, myshlenie poeticheskoe i mificheskoe, prilozheniia\" (From Notes on the Theory of Literature: Poetry and Prose, Tropes and Figures, Poetic and Mythical Thought, Addenda, 1905; repr 1970), and ‘\"Chernovyia zametki \"... o L.N. Tolstom i F.M. Dostoevskom’ (Preliminary Remarks ... on L. Tolstoy and F. Dostoevsky) in Voprosy teorii i psikhologii tvorchestva (vol 5 [1914]).\n\nRegarding language as an individual's or a nation's only possible means of perceiving the world and of thinking, Potebnja protested vehemently against denationalization in general and the Russification of Ukrainians in particular, and equated this process with spiritual and intellectual disintegration. Potebnja's philosophy of language is rooted in Wilhelm von Humboldt's romantic idealism, but he was also influenced by J. Herbart's and H. Lotze's associative psychology, and particularly by Heymann Steinthal's psycholinguistic writings.\n\nPotebnja viewed the history of a language as the history of its dialects and used the concept of phonetic law, although he often tried to find a psychological basis for the concept. He recognized the existence of a proto-Rus’ language, but located the beginning of its disintegration into dialects back in prehistoric times. He made many discoveries in Ukrainian historical phonetics, such as the primordial dž < dj alteration, the so-called second pleophony, and the conditions for the alternation e:o. He was the first to propose the theory that diphthongs were a transitional stage between Old Ukrainian o, e, and Modern Ukrainian i.\n\nAs an etymologist, Potebnja paid much attention to semantic development and the history of words against an expansive historical, folkloric, and psychological background. His major etymological writings were collected in K istorii zvukov russkago iazyka (Toward a History of the Sounds in the Russian Language, vols 2–4, 1880–1, 1883). His annotations to Slovo o polku Ihorevi (1878; repr 1914) are a brilliant synthesis of the etymological, folkloristic, and historical approaches.\n\nFrom the 1870s Potebnja concentrated on the study of the historical syntax of the Slavic languages against a comparative Indo-European background. His Iz zapisok po russkoi grammatike contains his writings on predicate forms and the participle (vol 2, 1874; rev edn 1888; repr 1958), the noun and the adjective (vol 3, 1899; repr 1968), and the verb and indeclinable words (vol 4, 1941; rev edn 1978). Before his work the field of Slavic historical syntax consisted mostly of inventories of constructions collected from literary monuments of various periods. He revised it to create a broadly drawn picture of category and construction changes tied to changes in ways of thinking, by integrating historical, dialectal, and folkloric materials. His comparative analysis uncovered remnants of prehistoric syntax in later constructions and reinterpretations of archaic constructions in later syntactic systems; that is, it demonstrated the historical character of syntactic categories and parts of speech. Anton Budilovich equated Potebnia's contribution to the field of historical syntax with C. Darwin's contribution to the study of the origin of species.\n\nPotebnja was far ahead of his contemporaries and not very popular during his lifetime. In the field of historical syntax his only immediate followers were A. Popov and, to a certain extent, Dmitrii Ovsianiko-Kulikovsky (in his outline of Russian syntax). His ideas on literature were adopted as a theoretical framework by the ‘Kharkiv school’ (B. Lezin, Vasyl Khartsiiev, A. Gornfeld, T. Rainov, Oleksa Vetukhiv, and others) grouped around the serial Voprosy teorii i psikhologii tvorchestva (8 vols, 1907–23). They also had a significant impact on the aesthetics of the Russian Symbolists (particularly A. Bely) and an indirect influence on the Ukrainian Symbolists. In 1945 the Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR (now NANU) was named after Potebnia. Collections of his works on accentology (1973) and esthetics and poetics (1976, 1985) have been published.\n\n"}

{"id": "1220137", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1220137", "title": "Chan Chan", "text": "Chan Chan\n\nChan Chan, the largest city of the pre-Columbian era in South America, is now an archaeological site in La Libertad Region west of Trujillo, Peru.\n\nChan Chan is located in the mouth of the Moche Valley and was the capital of the historical empire of the Chimor from 900 to 1470, when they were defeated and incorporated into the Inca Empire. Chimor, a conquest state, developed from the Chimú culture which established itself along the Peruvian coast around 1400 AD. In the Chimú tongue, Quingnam, Chan Chan means \"Sun Sun;\" it was named for its sunny climate which is cooled year round by a southerly breeze.\n\nChan Chan is in a particularly arid section of the coastal desert of northern Peru. Due to the lack of rain in this area, the major source of water for Chan Chan is in the form of rivers carrying surface runoff from the Andes. This runoff allows for control of land and water through irrigation systems.\n\nThe city of Chan Chan spanned 20 km² and had a dense urban center of 6 km² which contained extravagant \"ciudadelas\". \"Ciudadelas\" were large architectural masterpieces which housed plazas, storerooms, and burial platforms for the royals. The splendor of these \"ciudadelas\" suggests their association with the royal class. Housing for the lower classes of Chan Chan's hierarchical society are known as small, irregular agglutinated rooms (SIARs). Because the lower classes were often artisans whose role in the empire was to produce crafts, many of these SIARs were used as workshops.\n\nThe coordinates chosen at right for the location of Chan Chan were determined using \"Figure 1: Archaeological Zone of Chan Chan\" from Michael West's article, \"Community Settlement Patterns at Chan Chan, Peru\". In this figure, it can be seen that Verlarde, Laberinto, and Bandelier form the northern border of Chan Chan while Uhle, Chaiguac, Tschudi, and Rivero form its southern flanks. The location chosen for the coordinates is in the center of these cities and so represents a central location for the ruins of Chan Chan amidst this archaeological zone.\n\nThe name is probabilly derived from the Quingnam \"Jiang\" or \"Chang\" which means Sun, from which Chan-Chan would be literally: Sun-Sun. It is hypothesized that its true meaning would be: Great sun, resplendent Sun, splendid sun or refulgent sun (since a typical feature of the Quingnam language is that the reduplication of a word acquires a new meaning). Another theory says that the name would derive from the term: Shian or Sian. The \"Shi\" voice translates as Moon and \"An\" as house, meaning House of the Moon, making known that the Moon was the main deity.\n\nChan Chan is believed to have been constructed around 850 AD by the Chimú. It was the Chimor empire capital city with an estimated population of 40,000-60,000 people.\n\nAfter the Inca conquered the Chimú around 1470 AD, Chan Chan fell into decline. In 1535 AD, Francisco Pizarro founded the Spanish city of Trujillo which pushed Chan Chan further into the shadows. While no longer a teeming capital city, Chan Chan was still well known for its great riches and was consequently looted by the Spaniards. An indication of the great Chimú wealth is seen in a sixteenth century list of items looted from a burial tomb in Chan Chan; a treasure equivalent to 80,000 pesos of gold was recovered (nearly $5,000,000 US dollars in gold).\n\nIn 1969, Michael Moseley and Carol J. Mackey began excavations of Chan Chan; today these excavations continue under the Peruvian Instituto Nacional de Cultura.\n\nIn 1998, The \"Master Plan for Conservation and Management of the Chan Chan Archeological Complex\" was drawn up by the Freedom National Culture Institute of Peru with contributions from the World Heritage Foundation - WHR, ICCROM, and GCI. The plan was approved by the Peruvian Government. Methods of conservation include reinforcement and stabilization of structures of main buildings and around the Tschudi Palace, using a blend of traditional and modern engineering techniques. Chan Chan currently has 46 points of critical damage, though the site's total damage far exceeds these points. The regional government of La Libertad is funding conservation efforts at these points. \n\nOn 28 November 1986, UNESCO designated Chan Chan as a World Heritage Site as well as placed it on the List of World Heritage in Danger. The World Heritage Committee's initial recommendations included taking the appropriate measures for conservation, restoration, and management; halting any excavation that did not have accompanying conservation measures; and mitigation of plundering. A Pan-American Course on the Conservation and Management of Earthen Architectural and Archaeological Heritage was funded by many institutes coming together, including ICCROM, the Getty Conservation Institute, and the Government of Peru. \n\nThe archaeological site covers an area of approximately 20 square kilometers, being considered the largest adobe city on the Americas and the second on the world.\n\nThe walled compounds (palaces) that make up the metropolis are the following:\nThe walled complex \"Nik An\" is the greatest in illustration of the importance of water, particularly of the sea, and of the cult that surrounded it in the Chimu culture. The high reliefs of the walls represent fish, directed towards the north and the south (what can be interpreted as representation of the two currents that mark the Peruvian coast: that of Humboldt, cold, that comes from the south and the one of El Niño, hot, that comes from the north), waves, rombito (fishing nets), as well as pelicans and anzumitos (mixture of sea lion and otter).\n\nThis coastal society was governed by the powerful Chimucapac and was united by the force of a social control originated in the necessity of a strict management of the water, as well as by the external threats. The \"Nik An\" complex had a single entrance and high walls up to twelve meters for a better defense, and was wider at its bases (five meters) than at its summits (one meter), in anticipation of possible earthquakes on the seismic coast.\n\nThe city has ten walled \"ciudadelas\" which housed ceremonial rooms, burial chambers, temples, reservoirs and residences for the Chimú kings. In addition to the \"ciudadelas\", other compounds present in Chan Chan include courts, or \"audencias\", small, irregular agglutinated rooms (SIARs) and mounds called \"huacas\". Evidence for the significance of these structures is seen in many funerary ceramics recovered from Chan Chan. Many images seemingly depict structures very similar to \"audencias\" which indicates the cultural importance of architecture to the Chimú people of Chan Chan. Additionally, it should be noted that the construction of these massive architectural feats indicates that there was a large labor force available at Chan Chan. This further supports evidence for a hierarchical structure of society in Chan Chan as it was likely that the construction of this architecture was done by the working class.\nChan Chan is triangular, surrounded by walls. There are no enclosures opening north because the north-facing walls have the greatest sun exposure, serving to block wind and absorb sunlight where fog is frequent. The tallest walls shelter against south-westerly winds from the coast. The walls are adobe brick covered with a smooth surface into which intricate designs are carved. The two styles of carving design include a realistic representation of subjects such as birds, fish, and small mammals, as well as a more graphic, stylized representation of the same subjects. The carvings at Chan Chan depict crabs, turtles, and nets for catching sea creatures (such as Spondylus. Chan Chan, unlike most coastal ruins in Peru, is very close to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nOriginally the city relied on wells that were around 15 meters deep. To increase the farmland surrounding the city, a vast network of canals diverting water from the Moche river were created. Once these canals were in place, the city had the potential to grow exponentially. Many canals to the north were destroyed by a catastrophic flood around 1100 CE, which was the key motivation for the Chimú to refocus their economy to one rooted in foreign resources rather than in subsistence farming.\n\nThe ancient structures of Chan Chan are threatened by erosion due to changes in weather patterns — heavy rains, flooding, and strong winds. In particular, the city is severely threatened by storms from El Niño, which causes increased precipitation and flooding on the Peruvian coast. Chan Chan is the largest mud city in the world, and its fragile material is cause for concern. The heavy rains of El Niño damages the base of Chan Chan's structures. Increased rain also leads to increased humidity, and as humidity gathers in the bases of these structures, salt contamination and vegetation growth can occur, which further damage the integrity of Chan Chan's foundations. Global warming will only further these negative impacts, as climate change facilitates increased precipitation. \n\n\n\n"}

It was directed by Mel Stuart, and starred Gene Wilder as Wonka. The film tells the story of Charlie Bucket as he receives a golden ticket and visits Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with four other children from around the world. Filming took place in Munich in 1970, and the film was released on June 30, 1971. It received positive reviews, but it was a box office disappointment despite the fact that it recouped its budget. However, it developed into a cult film due to its repeated television airings and home video sales. In 1972, the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score.\n\n\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" is a 2005 film adaptation of the 1964 book of the same name by Roald Dahl. The film was directed by Tim Burton. The film stars Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. The storyline concerns Charlie, who takes a tour he has won, led by Wonka, through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world. Development for another adaptation of \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\", filmed previously as \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\", began in 1991, 20 years after the first film version, which resulted in Warner Bros. providing the Dahl Estate with total artistic control. Prior to Burton's involvement, directors such as Gary Ross, Rob Minkoff, Martin Scorsese and Tom Shadyac had been involved, while Warner Bros. either considered or discussed the role of Willy Wonka with Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Brad Pitt, Will Smith and Adam Sandler. Burton immediately brought regular collaborators Johnny Depp and Danny Elfman aboard. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" represents the first time since \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\" that Elfman contributed to the film score using written songs and his vocals. Filming took place from June to December 2004 at Pinewood Studios in the United Kingdom, where Burton avoided using digital effects as much as possible. \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" was released to critical praise and was a box office success, grossing approximately $475 million worldwide, but received mixed to negative reviews when compared with the original 1971 film.\n\nA direct-to-video animated crossover film adaptation starring Tom and Jerry, entitled \"Tom and Jerry: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\", was released in 2017. It stars JP Karliak as Willy Wonka and is dedicated to Gene Wilder, who died less than a year before the release.\n\nIn October 2016 it was confirmed that Warner Bros are planning a prequel film depicting Willy Wonka's \"early adventures\" prior to the events depicted in the books and films. However, Warner Bros claims that this movie will not be an origin story. In February 2018, Paul King entered final negotiations to direct the film. In November 2018, the producer confirmed it would be a prequel film, which would explore the adventures of Wonka before he opened the chocolate factory.\n\n\"Roald Dahl's Willy Wonka\" is a musical that combines elements of both Roald Dahl's book \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" and of the 1971 movie \"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\" with newly created material. The musical has several versions: the original version which premiered in 2004, the Junior version, the Kids version, and the Theatre for Young Audience version. All are owned by Music Theatre International, the company that owns the Willy Wonka license.\n\nThe Estate of Roald Dahl sanctioned an operatic adaptation called \"The Golden Ticket\". It was written by composer Peter Ash and British librettist Donald Sturrock. \"The Golden Ticket\" has completely original music and was commissioned by the American Lyric Theater, Lawrence Edelson (producing artistic director), and Felicity Dahl. The opera received its world premiere at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis on 13 June 2010, in a co-production with American Lyric Theater and Wexford Festival Opera.\n\nA musical based on the novel, titled \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" premiered at the West End's Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in May 2013 and officially opened on 25 June. The show is directed by Sam Mendes, with new songs by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, and stars Douglas Hodge as Willy Wonka. The production broke records for weekly ticket sales. Coincidentally, Hodge was also the voice of a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory audiobook, as part of a package of Roald Dahl CDs read by celebrities.\n\nThere are two \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" video games, one made in 1985 and another in 2005. The games are based on the book of the same name.\n\nCharlie and the Chocolate Factory: The Ride is a dark ride located in the Cloud Cuckoo Land area of Alton Towers theme park, Staffordshire, England. It is based upon the famous Roald Dahl book of the same name, and takes its thematic inspiration from the illustrations of Quentin Blake. The ride is split into two segments, the first being a boat ride along the chocolate river inside Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory. Passengers encounter all the characters from the book (going from Augustus Gloop to Veruca Salt) either as simple animatronics or CGI projections. After disembarking the boats the second segment begins with a short pre-show video (involving Mike Teevee). The video is presented as if the viewers are actually trapped within the TV set. The ride continues inside one of two 'Great Glass Elevators' which simulate passengers taking an airborne trip through the rest of the factory. Each elevator is a static room with semi-translucent walls and ceiling on which CGI animations are projected from the outside, and only the floor trembles slightly to give the impression of movement.\n\nList indicator(s)\n\n"}

This political organization stands in contrast to polities such as principalities where \"various princes were absolute rulers in their domain\" or in modern examples of totalitarian governments.\n\nCountervailance in formal political theory dates back at least to Medieval times, especially in Roman Catholic and early Protestant movements, not all of which were successful in achieving their own ends.\nThe Conciliar Movement, although ultimately ending in failure to reform the Catholic church, \"raised issues that are fundamental in all domains of social organization, and it contributed to the understanding of the general principle of countervailance, which eventually became the foundation of modern constitutionalism.\"\n\nIn the 20th century, \"Countervailing Power\" is a theory of political modification of markets, formulated by American economist John Kenneth Galbraith in his 1952 book \"American Capitalism\". In the classic liberal economy, goods and services are provided and prices set by free bargaining. According to Galbraith, modern economies give massive powers to large business corporations to bias this process, and there arise 'countervailing' powers in the form of trade unions, citizens' organizations and so on, to offset business's excessive advantage. On page 126 of this book, Galbraith elaborates on countervailing power in the sphere of economics when he states:\"The development of countervailing power requires a certain minimum opportunity and capacity for organization, corporate or otherwise. If the large retail buying organizations had not developed the countervailing power which they have used, by proxy, on behalf of the individual consumer, consumers would have been faced with the need to organize the equivalent of the retailer's power. This would have been a formidable task but it has been accomplished in Scandinavia where the consumer's co-operative, instead of the chain store, is the dominant instrument of countervailing power in consumers' goods markets.\"\n\nSeventeenth century England was an active time for the development of countervailance theory. Although much political discourse during the period was focused on the matter of \"sovereignty\", or absolutism for the sovereign as, for example, we observe in the writings of Thomas Hobbes, the principle \"significance of seventeenth-century England for constitutional theory was that during this period the concept of sovereignty was \"replaced\" by the concept of checks and balances.\"\nThe evolution of political practice in England paralleled the evolution in theory, for it was during this period that \"the operational dynamics of the system developed in accordance with the countervailance model of government.\"\nWhile the trend reversed somewhat under the power of Oliver Cromwell and the era of the later Stuarts, and was therefore rather uneven over the flow of the 17th century, the Glorious Revolution of 1688 \"firmly established the principles of dispersed power and checks and balances as the central pillars of English constitutionalism.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "605581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=605581", "title": "European Americans", "text": "European Americans\n\nEuropean Americans (also referred to as Euro-Americans) are Americans of European ancestry. This term includes people who are descended from the first European settlers in America and as well as people who are descended from more recent European arrivals. Euro-Americans are the largest panethnic group in the United States, both historically and at present.\n\nThe Spaniards are thought to be the first Europeans to establish a continuous presence in what is now the contiguous United States, with Martín de Argüelles ( 1566) in St. Augustine, then a part of Spanish Florida. Virginia Dare ( August 18, 1587) on Roanoke Colony, present-day North Carolina was the first English child and girl, in a late 16th-century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement in North America.\n\nIn the 2016 American Community Survey, German Americans (13.9%), Irish Americans (10.0%), English Americans (7.4%), Italian Americans (5.2%), and Polish Americans (3%) were the five largest self-reported European ancestry groups in the United States forming over a third of the total population. \nHowever, the English Americans and British Americans demography is considered by some to be under-counted, as the people in that demographic tend to identify themselves simply as Americans (20,151,829 or 7.2%). In the 2000 census over 56 million or 19.9% of the United States population ignored the ancestry question completely and classified as \"unspecified\" and \"not reported\".\n\nIn 1995, as part of a review of the Office of Management and Budget's Statistical Policy Directive No. 15 (Race and Ethnic Standards for Federal Statistics and Administrative Reporting), a survey was conducted of census recipients to determine their preferred terminology for the racial/ethnic groups defined in the Directive. For the \"White\" group, \"European American\" came third, preferred by 2.35% of panel interviewees.\n\nThe term is sometimes used interchangeably with Caucasian American, White American, and Anglo American in many places around the United States. However, the terms Caucasian and White are purely racial terms, not geographic, and include some populations whose origin is outside of Europe; and \"Anglo-American\" also has another definition, meaning, Euro-Americans with English ancestry. \"European American\", when used properly, has a more specific definition and scope.\n\nThe term is used by some to emphasize the European cultural and geographical ancestral origins of Americans, in the same way as is done for African Americans and Asian Americans. A European American awareness is still notable because 90% of the respondents classified as white in the U.S. Census knew their European ancestry. Historically, the concept of an American originated in the United States as a person of European ancestry, thus excluding African Americans, Jews, and Native Americans.\n\nAs a linguistic concern, the term is sometimes meant to discourage a dichotomous view of the racial landscape between the white category and everyone else. Margo Adair suggests that the recognition of specific European American ancestries allows certain Americans to become aware that they come from a variety of different cultures.\n\nSince 1607, some 57 million immigrants have come to the United States from other lands. Approximately 10 million passed through on their way to some other place or returned to their original homelands, leaving a net gain of some 47 million people.\n\nBetween 1607 and 1776 most European settlements were British. Colonial stock of English, Scottish, Scotch-Irish, Cornish or Welsh descent, may be found throughout the country but is especially dominant in New England and the South. Some people of colonial stock, especially in the Mid-Atlantic states, are also of Dutch, German and Flemish descent. The vast majority of these are Protestants. The Pennsylvania Dutch (German American) population gave the state of Pennsylvania a high German cultural character. French descent, which can also be found throughout the country, is most concentrated in Louisiana, while Spanish descent is dominant in the Southwest and Florida. These are primarily Roman Catholic and were assimilated with the Louisiana Purchase and the aftermath of the Mexican–American War and Adams–Onís Treaty, respectively.\n\nThe first large wave of European migration after the Revolutionary War came from Northern and Central-Western Europe between about 1820 and 1890. Most of these immigrants were from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, Denmark, and Britain, and with large numbers of Irish and German Catholics immigrating, Roman Catholicism became an important minority religion. Polish Americans usually used to come as German or Austrian citizens, since Poland lost its independence in the period between 1772 and 1795. Descendants of the first wave are dominant in the Midwest and West, although German descent is extremely common in Pennsylvania, and Irish descent is also common in urban centers in the Northeast. The Irish and Germans held onto their ethnic identity throughout the 19th and early half of the 20th centuries, as well as other European ethnic groups. Most people of Polish origin live in the Northeast and the Midwest (see also White ethnic).\n\nThe second wave of European Americans arrived from the mid-1890s to the 1920s, mainly from Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Ireland. This wave included Irish, Italians, Greeks, Hungarians, Portuguese, Romanians, Ukrainians, Russians, Poles and other Slavs. With large numbers of immigrants from Spain, Mexico, Spanish Caribbean, and South and Central America, White Hispanics have increased to 8% of the US population, and Texas, California, New York, and Florida are important centers for them. \n\nBefore 1881, the vast majority of immigrants, almost 86% of the total, arrived from northwest Europe, principally Great Britain, Ireland, Germany, and Scandinavia. The years between 1881 and 1893 the pattern shifted, in the sources of U.S. \"New immigration\".\nBetween 1894 and 1914, immigrants from southern, central, and eastern Europe accounted for 69% of the total. Prior to 1960, the overwhelming majority came from Europe or of European descent from Canada. The shift in European immigration has been in decline since the mid-20th century, with 75.0% of the total foreign-born population born in Europe compared to 12.1% recorded in the 2010 census.\n\n\nThe figures below show that of the total population of specified birthplace in the United States. A total of 11.1% were born-overseas of the total population.\n\nThe numbers below give numbers of European Americans as measured by the U.S. Census in 1980, 1990, and 2000. The numbers are measured according to declarations in census responses. This leads to uncertainty over the real meaning of the figures: For instance, as can be seen, according to these figures, the European American population dropped 40 million in ten years, but in fact, this is a reflection of changing census responses. In particular, it reflects the increased popularity of the \"American\" option following its inclusion as an example in the 2000 census forms.\n\nBreakdowns of the European American population into sub-components is a difficult and rather arbitrary exercise. Farley (1991) argues that \"because of ethnic intermarriage, the numerous generations that separate respondents from their forebears and the apparent unimportance to many whites of European origin, responses appear quite inconsistent\".\n\nIn particular, a large majority of European Americans have ancestry from a number of different countries and the response to a single \"ancestry\" gives little indication of the backgrounds of Americans today. When only prompted for a single response, the examples given on the census forms and a pride in identifying the more distinctive parts of one's heritage are important factors; these will likely adversely affect the numbers reporting ancestries from the British Isles. Multiple response ancestry data often greatly increase the numbers reporting for the main ancestry groups, although Farley goes as far to conclude that \"no simple question will distinguish those who identify strongly with a specific European group from those who report symbolic or imagined ethnicity.\" He highlights responses in the Current Population Survey (1973) where for the main \"old\" ancestry groups (e.g., German, Irish, English, and French), over 40% change their reported ancestry over the six-month period between survey waves (page 422).\n\nAn example is that in 1980 23.75 million Americans claimed English ancestry and 25.85 claimed English ancestry together with one or more other. This represents 49.6 million people. The table below shows that in 1990 when only single and primary responses were allowed this fell to 32 million and in 2000 to 24 million.\n\nThe largest self-reported ancestries in 2000, reporting over 5 million members, were in order: German, Irish, English, American, Italian, French, and Polish. They have different distributions within the United States; in general, the northern half of the United States from Pennsylvania westward is dominated by German ancestry, and the southern-half by English and American. Irish may be found throughout the entire country.\n\nItalian ancestry is most common in the Northeast, Polish in the Great Lakes Region and the Northeast, and French in New England and Louisiana. U.S. Census Bureau statisticians estimate that approximately 62 percent of European Americans today are either wholly or partly of English, Welsh, Irish, or Scottish ancestry. Approximately 86% of European Americans today are of northwestern and central European ancestry, and 14% are of southeastern European and White Hispanic and Latino American descent.\n\nThe culture of the Americans of European descent, European-American culture, is the culture of the United States. As the largest component of the American population, the overall American culture deeply reflects the European-influenced culture that predates the United States of America as an independent state. Much of American culture shows influences from the diverse nations of the United Kingdom and Ireland, such as the English, Irish, Cornish, Manx, Scotch-Irish and Welsh. Colonial ties to Great Britain spread the English language, legal system and other cultural attributes. Scholar David Hackett Fischer asserts in \"\" that the folkways of four groups of people who moved from distinct regions of the United Kingdom to the United States persisted and provide a substantial cultural basis for much of the modern United States. Fischer explains \"the origins and stability of a social system which for two centuries has remained stubbornly democratic in its politics, capitalist in its economy, libertarian in its laws and individualist in its society and pluralistic in its culture.\"\n\nMuch of the European-American cultural lineage can be traced back to Western and Northern Europe, which is institutionalized in the government, traditions, and civic education in the United States.\nSince most later European Americans have assimilated into American culture, most European Americans now generally express their individual ethnic ties sporadically and symbolically and do not consider their specific ethnic origins to be essential to their identity; however, European American ethnic expression has been revived since the 1960s. Some European Americans such as Italians, Greek Americans, Polish Americans, Germans, Ukranians, Irish, and others have maintained high levels of ethnic identity. Same applied to Polish Americans. In the 1960s, Mexican Americans, Jewish Americans, and African Americans started exploring their cultural traditions as the ideal of cultural pluralism took hold. European Americans followed suit by exploring their individual cultural origins and having less shame of expressing their unique cultural heritage.\n\nThe Solutrean hypothesis suggested that Europeans may have been among the first in the Americas. More recent research has argued this not to be the case and that the founding Native American population came from Siberia through Beringia. An article in the \"American Journal of Human Genetics\" states \"Here we show, by using 86 complete mitochondrial genomes, that all Native American haplogroups, including haplogroup X, were part of a single founding population, thereby refuting multiple-migration models.\"\n\n\nThe American legal system also has its roots in French philosophy with the separation of powers and the federal system along with English law in common law. For example, elements of the Magna Carta in it contain provisions on criminal law that were incorporated into the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution.\nIt as well as other documents had elements influencing and incorporated into the United States Constitution.\n\n\n\n\nEnglish lawyer William Bray recorded a game of baseball on Easter Monday 1755 in Guildford, Surrey; Bray's diary was verified as authentic in September 2008. This early form of the game was apparently brought to North America by English immigrants. The first appearance of the term that exists in print was in \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\" in 1744, where it is called Base-Ball. Today, Rounders which has been played in England since Tudor times holds a similarity to Baseball. Although, literary references to early forms of \"base-ball\" in England pre-date use of the term \"rounders\".\n\nAnother area of cultural influence are American Patriotic songs:\nBefore 1931, other songs served as the hymns of American officialdom.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the heritage that all 44 US Presidents come from (or in some combination thereof): is British (English, Scottish, Scotch-Irish or Welsh) ancestry. Others include John F. Kennedy of Irish descent, Martin Van Buren of Dutch descent and three presidents whose fathers were of German descent: Dwight D. Eisenhower (whose original family name was \"Eisenhauer\"),Herbert Hoover (\"Huber\"), and Donald Trump. Later US Presidents' ancestry can often be traced to ancestors from multiple nations in Europe.\n\nSome White Americans have varying amounts of American Indian and Sub-Saharan African ancestry. In a recent study, Gonçalves et al. 2007 reported Sub-Saharan and Amerindian mtDna lineages at a frequency of 3.1% (respectively 0.9% and 2.2%) in American Caucasians (Please note that in the USA, \"Caucasian\" includes people from North Africa and Western Asia as well as Europeans). Recent research on Y-chromosomes and mtDNA detected no African admixture in European-Americans. The sample included 628 European-American Y-chromosomes and mtDNA from 922 European-Americans\n\nDNA analysis on White Americans by geneticist Mark D. Shriver showed an average of 0.7% Sub-Saharan African admixture and 3.2% Native American admixture. The same author, in another study, claimed that about 30% of all White Americans, approximately 66 million people, have a median of 2.3% of Black African admixture. Later, Shriver retracted his statement, saying that actually around 5% of White Americans exhibit some detectable level of African ancestry.\n\nFrom the 23andMe database, about 5 to at least 13 percent of self-identified White American Southerners have greater than 1 percent African ancestry. Southern states with the highest African American populations, tended to have the highest percentages of hidden African ancestry. White Americans (European Americans) on average are: \"98.6 percent European, 0.19 percent African and 0.18 percent Native American.\" Inferred British/Irish ancestry is found in European Americans from all states at mean proportions of\nabove 20%, and represents a majority of ancestry, above 50% mean proportion, in states such\nas Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. Scandinavian\nancestry in European Americans is highly localized; most states show only trace mean\nproportions of Scandinavian ancestry, while it comprises a significant proportion, upwards of\n10%, of ancestry in European Americans from Minnesota and the Dakotas.\n\n"}

{"id": "11177988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11177988", "title": "Guild of Romanists", "text": "Guild of Romanists\n\nThe Guild of Romanists or Confrérie van romanisten was a society which was active in Antwerp from the late 16th to the late 18th century. It was made up of notables and artists of Antwerp who had visited Rome and offered artists access to the networks of Antwerp's urban elites.\n\nThe Confrérie was established in 1572 in Antwerp's Cathedral of Our Lady under the patronage of St. Paul and St. Peter and was therefore also known as the 'Broederschap van de HH. Petrus en Paulus' (Confrérie of St. Peter and Paul). It was a condition of membership to have visited Rome. The condition of having visited Rome to enjoy membership appears to have been strictly enforced and art historians accept membership of the Confrérie as evidence of visits to Rome that are (in the case of Fyt etc.) otherwise undocumented.\n\nThe membership included canons, prosperous merchants, members of the local nobility, aldermen and leading artists. Total membership was capped at 25 members, which accentuated the exclusive character of the society. Deans of the Confrérie were appointed annually. \nAfter 1680 the Confrérie went into decline. The Confrérie moved in 1681 for financial reasons to Antwerp's St George's Church and remained dormant for a few decades. It was revived in 1716 when the 'true and approved' relics of St. Peter and Paul were delivered to St George's Church by a Roman cardinal. The Confrérie was finally abolished in 1785 under the rule of the Emperor Joseph II of Austria.\n\nA Magistrate Book (1576), the \"LIBER CONFRATERNITATIS SANCTORUM PETRI ET PAULI EN ROMA' is kept in the State Archives.\n\nThe diversity of the membership offered artists a good opportunity to meet with potential patrons. A similar social mediation role was played by the chambers of rhetoric and in particular the Violieren, which was the chamber of rhetoric of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke. Membership assisted artists further in raising their profile and prestige in society at large as well as among their fellow artists since only renowned artists were invited to join.\n\nThe non-artist members relied on membership of the Confrérie to consolidate their social standing since many of the artist members enjoyed an international reputation.\n\nThe social role of the Confrérie was facilitated through the institution of an annual gastronomic dinner (the '(h)eerlyck maeltyt'), with excellent wines and copious servings of food. The dinner was hosted at different locations.\n\nThe Confrérie further allowed \"'art-pilgrims' to keep themselves up to date on news from Rome, whether it be on new painters or paintings, or newly discovered antiquities\".\n\n"}

Tens of mostly abandoned buildings were decorated by international artists in the period 5–21 July 2012, culminating in a grand opening and a guided town tour attended by hundreds.\n\nThe event was curated by noted Norwegian urban artist \"Pøbel\". Participating artists were Stephen Powers (United States), \"Vhils\" (Portugal), \"Roa\" (Belgium), Atle Østrem (Norway), \"Ethos\" (Brazil), \"E. B. Itso\", \"Husk mit navn\" (both Denmark), \"Horfe\", Ken Sortais, \"Remed\" (all France) and Conor Harrington (Ireland).\n\nVardø is Norway's north-easternmost town. Traditionally a vibrant fishing community, the town's population halved between the 1960s and 2000s. As per 2012, depopulation had balanced out and Vardø had 2,122 inhabitants. Because of the population decline, Vardø was left with many empty buildings in various stages of disrepair. \"Pøbel\" wanted to organize a larger scale continuation of the \"Getto spedalsk\" (\"Ghetto leperous\") project, where he and collaborator \"Dolk\" painted abandoned buildings in at the Lofoten islands.\n\nAfter securing the cooperation of local developers in spring 2012, the project started getting permission from individual property owners to decorate buildings. The name \"Komafest\" plays on the notion of the houses being roused from their sleep by the activity.\n\nAlthough substantial financing had been secured from, among others, the Northern Norway Artists' Centre, much of the daily activity relied on volunteer work and free use of privately owned heavy equipment, including lifts and cranes. \"Pøbel\" himself insisted the festival was as much about the locals and the town as it was the art, saying he hoped that the festival would be a catalyst for renovation and increased enthusiasm for local history. Early on, the 100-year-old municipal cinema, closed for over 20 years and used as a warehouse, was cleared and used to host a lecture by author Tristan Manco and screen street art films.\n\nAfter the opening weekend, the festival secured financing, equipment and political permission to realise the long-planned idea of planting an old bus next to the underwater tunnel that leads to Vardø. The bus was previously used to transport families and their belongings out of Vardø during the era of mass de-population.\n\n"}

{"id": "43225091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43225091", "title": "Mihai Ralea", "text": "Mihai Ralea\n\nMihai Dumitru Ralea (also known as Mihail Ralea, Michel Raléa, or Mihai Rale; May 1, 1896 – August 17, 1964) was a Romanian social scientist, cultural journalist, and political figure. He debuted as an affiliate of Poporanism, the left-wing agrarian movement, which he infused with influences from corporatism and Marxism. A distinguished product of French academia, Ralea rejected traditionalism and welcomed cultural modernization, outlining the program for a secular and democratic \"peasant state\". His ideology blended into his scholarly work, with noted contributions to political sociology, the sociology of culture, and social and national psychology. He was a professor at the University of Iași and, from 1938, the University of Bucharest.\n\nBy 1935, Ralea had become a doctrinaire of the National Peasants' Party, managing \"Viața Românească\" review and \"Dreptatea\" daily. He had publicized polemics with the far-right circles and fascist Iron Guard, which he denounced as alien to the Romanian ethos. He later drifted apart from the party's centrist leadership and his own democratic ideology, setting up a Socialist Peasants' Party, then embracing authoritarian politics. He was a founding member and Labor Minister of the dictatorial National Renaissance Front, representing its corporatist left-wing. He fell from power in 1940, finding himself harassed by successive fascist regimes, and became a \"fellow traveler\" of the underground Communist Party.\n\nRalea willingly cooperated with the communists and the Ploughmen's Front before and after their arrival to power, serving as Minister of Arts, Ambassador to the United States, and vice president of the Great National Assembly. He was sidelined, then recovered, by the communist regime, and, as a Marxist humanist, was one of its leading cultural ambassadors by 1960. Heavily controlled by communist censorship, his work gave scientific credentials to the regime's anti-American propaganda, though Ralea also used his position to protect some of those persecuted by the authorities.\n\nRalea's final contributions assisted in the re-professionalization of Romanian psychology and education, with the retention of a more liberal communist doctrine. Always an avid traveler and raconteur, he died abroad, while on mission to the UNESCO. He endures in cultural memory as a controversial figure. He is celebrated for his sociological and critical insights, but reprehended for his nepotism, his political choices, and his literary compromises. His only, and last, direct descendant was a daughter, Catinca Ralea, who achieved literary fame as a translator of Western literature.\n\nA native of Huși, Fălciu County (currently in Vaslui County), Ralea was the son of a Dumitru Ralea, a local magistrate, and Ecaterina Botezatu-Ralea. According to historian Camelia Zavarache, Ralea's ethnic background was non-Romanian: on his father's side, he was a Bulgarian, while his mother was Jewish. The family was relatively wealthy, and Dumitru had served as Fălciu representative in the Senate of Romania. His son was always spiritually attached to his native region and, later in life, bought himself a vineyard on Dobrina Hill, just outside Huși, building himself a vacation home. Huși was where he completed his primary education, before he moved on to the urban center of Iași, where he enlisted at boarding school (\"Liceul Internat\"). He was colleagues with another future sociologist, D. I. Suchianu. The two remained personal and political friends for the rest of their lives. Another enduring friendship was formed on school grounds between Ralea and historian Petre Constantinescu-Iași, who became Ralea's main connection to the revolutionary left.\n\nRalea went on to attend the University of Bucharest Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, under Constantin Rădulescu-Motru (who shortlisted and prepared Ralea for academic tenure). He made his debut in publishing during 1916, with an essay in Rădulescu-Motru's \"Revista de Filozofie\", and with \"Convorbiri Literare\" articles that he usually signed with the initials \"M. R.\" (an alternative signature he would use for the rest of his career). Ralea was university colleagues with philosophers Tudor Vianu and Nicolae Bagdasar, with whom he remained close friends for the rest of his life. Their studies were interrupted by the Romanian Campaign of World War I, during which time Ralea relocated to Iași. He took his final examination in Law and Letters at the University of Iași, in 1918. His professors included the culture critic Garabet Ibrăileanu, who became Ralea's mentor. Ralea recalled that his first encounter with Ibrăileanu was \"my life's greatest intellectual event\".\n\nDescribed by Vianu as a \"young luminary\" with \"new and original ideas\", \"always surrounded by a sizable pack of students\", Ralea returned to cultural journalism in postwar Greater Romania. From February 1919, he was a contributor to the Iași-based review \"Însemnări Literare\", which stood in for the temporarily disestablished \"Viața Românească\". The magazine was managed by the novelist Mihail Sadoveanu and heavily influenced by Ibrăileanu. Their friendship sealed Ralea's affiliation to prewar Poporanism, a leftist current which promoted agrarianism, \"national specificity\", and art with a social mission. The \"Însemnări Literare\" group also recognized that Poporanism was made inadequate by the social promises of land reform and universal male suffrage. These policies, Ibrăileanu acknowledged, \"settled a debt\" with the peasantry. Poporanism was generally pro-Westernization, with a noted reserve; taken separately, Ralea was the most pro-Western, socialist, and least culturally conservative thinker of this category.\n\nAlso in 1919, Ralea and his new friend, Andrei Oțetea, earned state scholarships to complete his doctorate in Paris. Ralea entered the École Normale Supérieure as a disciple of Lucien Herr, simultaneously registering for doctoral programs in letters and politics, with interests in sociology and psychology. He studied under the functionalist Célestin Bouglé, then under Paul Fauconnet and Lucien Lévy-Bruhl, and later, at the Collège de France, under Pierre Janet. As he himself recounted, he became a passionate follower of the French Left, a reader of Jean Jaurès, and a guest of Léon Blum's. He defined himself as a rationalist, heir to the Age of Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and was ostensibly an atheist. Ralea's secular agenda was underscored when he joined the Romanian Freemasonry, which, historian Lucian Nastasă writes, implied a commitment to freethought and religious toleration.\n\nFor a while, Ralea managed a Romanian restaurant owned by the banker Aristide Blank. He was part of a tight cell of Romanian students in letters or history, which also included Oțetea, Gheorghe Brătianu, and Alexandru Rosetti, who remained close friends over the decades. Suchianu and his sister Ioana, who were also studying in Paris, lived in the same boarding house as Ralea.\n\nWith funds raised by a Support Committee that included Ralea, \"Viața Românească\" was eventually revived by Ibrăileanu. Ralea became its foreign correspondent, sending in articles about the intellectual life and philosophical doctrines of the Third Republic, and possibly the first Romanian notices about the work of Marcel Proust. He traveled extensively, studying first-hand the cultural life of France, Belgium, Italy, and Weimar Germany.\n\nIn 1922, Ralea took his \"Docteur d'État\" degree (the sixth Romanian to ever qualify for it) with \"L'idée de la révolution dans les doctrines socialistes\" (\"The Idea of Revolution in Socialist Doctrines\"). Under the Francized name \"Michel Raléa\", he published it at Rivière company in 1923. \"L'idée de la révolution...\" theorized that, in order to be classified as a revolution, a social movement needed at once a \"social body\", an \"ideal\", and a \"transfer of power\"—depending on which trait was prevailing, revolutions were, respectively, \"organic\", \"programmatic\", or \"means-based\". The focus of his attention was Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, whom he rediscovered (and criticized) as a proponent of \"class solidarity\" and nonviolent revolution. The work earned Ralea the Institut de France's Prix Osiris and a Doctor of Letters degree in 1923. He spent another several months frequenting Berlin University lectures. It was there that he first met a future enemy, the poet-mathematician Ion Barbu. The latter left a corrosive record of their first encounter, dismissing Ralea as a \"clown\" with \"aristocratic manias\".\n\nUpon his return to Romania, Ralea began publishing his political and sociological essays in reviews such as \"Fapta\", \"Ideea Europeană\", and \"Gândirea\". He was also involved with Dimitrie Gusti and Virgil Madgearu's Romanian Social Institute, publishing his texts in its \"Arhiva pentru Știință și Reformă Socială\". In 1923, it hosted his essay on \"The Issue of Societal Classification\" and his critical review of German sociology. While still in Paris, Ralea was confident that he would find employment: the University of Iași Chair of Sociology had been set aside for him by Rădulescu-Motru, with Ibrăileanu's approval. The matter was complicated when another Paris graduate, Garabet Aslan, ran for the same position. Supported by Ibrăileanu and Gusti, Ralea was eventually moved to the Logic and Modern Philosophy Department, as an assistant professor to Ion Petrovici, while also employed as lecturer in social pedagogy. According to Ralea's own words, this was a \"ridiculous\" situation: most of his students were girls, some of whom were infatuated with him. He had married Ioana Suchianu in November 1923, while still in Bucharest, and lived with her in a small apartment above the \"Viața Românească\" offices.\n\nFor the next two years, Ralea diversified his qualifications with the goal of obtaining employment in his main field. He published the tract \"Formația ideii de personalitate\" (\"How the Notion of Personality Is Formed\"), noted as a pioneering introduction to behavioural genetics. On January 1, 1926, following good referrals from Petrovici (and despite the preference of psychology students, who favored C. Fedeleș), Ralea was appointed Professor of Psychology and Aesthetics at Iași University.\n\nRalea soon became one of \"Viața Românească\"s ideologues and polemicists, as well as architect of its satire column, \"Miscellanea\" (alongside Suchianu and, initially, George Topîrceanu). By 1925, he was also regularly featured in the left-wing daily \"Adevărul\", and its cultural supplement, \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\". His essays were taken up by other cultural magazines throughout Romania, including \"Kalende\" of Pitești and \"Minerva\" of Iași. In 1927, when Ralea published his \"Contribuțiuni la știința societății\" (\"Contributions to Social Science\") and \"Introducere în sociologie\" (\"Companion to Sociology\"), Gusti's Social Institute had Ralea as a guest speaker, with a lecture on \"Social Education\". At around that time, with Gusti as president of the Broadcasting Company, Ralea became a frequent presence on the radio.\n\nIn his columns and essays, Ralea defended Ibrăileanu's \"national specificity\" against criticism from the new-wave modernists at \"Sburătorul\". Eugen Lovinescu, the modernist ideologue, had reconnected with 19th-century classical liberalism, rejecting Poporanism as a nationalist, culturally isolationist, and socializing phenomenon. Lovinescu and Ralea denounced each other's politics as reactionary. Ralea opined that Poporanist ideas were still culturally relevant, and not in fact isolationist, since they provided a recipe for \"originality\"; as he put it, \"national specificity\" had become inevitable. The conflict was not just political: Ralea also objected to modernist aesthetics, from the pure poetry cultivated by \"Sburătorul\" to the more radical Constructivism of \"Contimporanul\" magazine.\n\nRalea was not an anti-modernist, but rather a particular modernist. According to his friend and colleague Octav Botez, he was an \"integrally modern man\" in tastes and behavior, \"one of the few philosophers who conceived of, and lived, their lives as regular people, with a naturalness and facility that were charming and stimulating.\" The same was also noted by \"Contimporanul\" writer Sergiu Dan, who proposed that Ralea denied himself \"all sort of transaction with the confuse world of sentiment\".\n\nRalea's literary columns very often promoted modernist writers, or modernist interpretations of classical ones, such as when he used Janet's psychology to explain the genesis of works by Thomas Hardy. More famous was his reading of Proust through Henri Bergson's classification of memory. Ralea offered much praise to rationalist modernists such as Alexandru A. Philippide, and hailed Tudor Arghezi, the eclectic modernizer of poetic language, as Romania's greatest poet of the day. Ralea (and, before him, Ibrăileanu) campaigned for social realism in prose. His natural favorite was Sadoveanu, but he was also enthusiastic about modernist novels with a flavor of social radicalism, including those by \"Sburătorul\"s Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu.\n\nWith the Lovinescu–Ralea debate occupying the center stage at \"Viața Românească\" and \"Sburătorul\", a new intellectual movement, critical of both modernism and Poporanism, was emerging in the cultural life of Greater Romania. Led by poet-theologian Nichifor Crainic, this group took over at \"Gândirea\", turning the magazine against its former \"Viața Românească\" allies. As pointed out by Lovinescu, Ralea was initially welcoming of Crainic's \"remarkable\" program. He did not object to Crainic's Romanian Orthodox devotion (seeing it as compatible with secularism and \"national specificity\"), but mainly to his national conservatism, which worshiped the historical past. Like other Poporanists, Ralea adopted left-wing nationalism, arguing that the very concept of nation was a product of French radicalism: \"[It] emerged from the great French Revolution, the modest ideology of the bourgeoisie. [...] What's more, we may claim that only a democracy can truly be nationalistic.\" He credited the core ideas of Romanian liberalism, according to which Romanian national awareness was an afterthought of Jacobinism: \"We have had to visit France to find out we're Romanians.\" As noted by scholar Balázs Trencsényi: \"Ralea sought to separate the study of national specificity, which he considered to be legitimate, from the exhortation of national particulars, which he rejected.\"\n\nIn 1928, \"Gândirea\" hosted the inflammatory \"White Lily\" Manifesto. It signaled the Poporanists' confrontation with a \"new generation\" of anti-rationalists, and Ralea's personal rivalry with one of the White Lily intellectuals, Petre Pandrea. Pandrea's Manifesto was at once a plea for aestheticism and mysticism, a critique of \"that famed social justice\" idea, and an explicit denunciation of Ralea, Ibrăileanu, Suchianu and the \"Sburătorul\" group as \"dry\", \"barren\", all too critical. Ralea answered with half-satirical comments: the country, he noted, could do without \"prophets\" with \"fun and interesting biases\", but not without \"liberty, paved roads, justice and cleanliness in the streets\". In his view, the Manifesto authors were modern-day Rasputins, prone to fanatical vandalism.\n\nFrom that moment on, Crainic's Orthodox spirituality and traditionalism made a slow transition into far-right politics. Their rejection of democracy became another issue of dispute, with Ralea noting, in 1930, that \"all civilized countries are democratic; all semi-civilized or primitive countries are dictatorial.\" Over the years, \"Gândirists\" produced more and more systematic attacks on Ralea's ideology, condemning its atheism, \"historical materialism\", and Francophilia. In reply, Ralea noted that, beyond their facade, national and religious conservatism meant a reinstatement of primitive customs, obscurantism, Neoplatonism, and Byzantinism. He pushed the envelope by demanding a program of forced Westernization and secularization, to mirror Kemalism.\n\nHis comments also challenged the grounding of \"Gândirist\" theory: Romanian Orthodoxy, he noted, was part of an international Orthodox phenomenon that mainly included Slavs, whereas many Romanians were Greek-Catholic. He concluded, therefore, that Orthodoxy could never claim synonymy with the Romanian ethos. Ralea also insisted that, despite its nativist anti-Western claims, Orthodox religiousness was a modern \"trifle\", that owed inspiration to Keyserling's Theosophy and Cocteau's Catholicism. He maintained that Romanian peasants, whose religiousness was exhorted by Crainic, were \"superstitious, but atheistic\", not respectful \"of any spiritual value when it should compete with their logical instincts.\" No other people, he contented, was as blasphemous as Romanians when it came to profanities.\n\nRalea collected his critical essays as a set of volumes: \"Comentarii și sugestii\" (\"Comments and Suggestions\"), \"Interpretări\" (\"Interpretations\"), \"Perspective\" (\"Perspectives\"). He was still involved in psychological research, with tracts such as \"Problema inconștientului\" (\"The Problem of the Unconscious Mind\") and \"Ipoteze și precizări privind știința sufletului\" (\"Hypotheses and Précis Regarding Spiritual Science\"). Ralea also resumed his European travels, touring the Kingdom of Spain, and was unenthusiastic about its conservatism. Ralea's travelogue, \"Memorial din Spania\", depicts the country as a reactionary bulwark of \"somber priests\" and \"festooned soldiers\". Another \"Memorial\", serialized by \"Adevărul Literar și Artistic\", detailed his trips through Germanic-speaking Europe.\n\nShortly before the election of December 1928, Ralea was attracted into the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ), speaking out against the National Liberal political class as \"an abnormal regime of corruption and brutality.\" He successfully contested a seat in the Assembly of Deputies, and was reelected in 1933; during that interval, he also presided upon Fălciu's party chapter. Ralea was one of a compact group of National Peasantist academics in Poporanist Iași, together with Botez, Oțetea, Constantin Balmuș, Iorgu Iordan, Petre Andrei, Traian Bratu, and Traian Ionașcu. Inside the party, Ralea was a follower of the Poporanist founding figure, Constantin Stere, but did not follow Stere's \"Democratic Peasantist\" dissidence of 1930. Around 1929, Ralea was a noted contributor to the party press organ \"Acțiunea Țărănistă\" and to Teodorescu-Braniște's \"Revista Politică\". In January 1933, Ibrăileanu retired, leaving Ralea and literary critic George Călinescu as editors of \"Viața Românească\".\n\nRalea eventually affiliated with the centrist current of the PNȚ, distancing himself from those party factions who were tempted by socialism. Ralea and Ibrăileanu still promoted the vision of a \"peasant state\", accepting socialist reformism, but still cautious of socialist industrialization, and rejected outright the idea of proletarian primacy. Criticized by the communist left as \"outstanding shortsightedness\", this ideological position came to define the PNȚ in the mid 1930s. Ralea defended classical parliamentarianism at several Inter-Parliamentary Union meetings, including the 1933 conference in the Republic of Spain, but insisted on the benefits of statism and a planned economy.\n\nBy then, Ralea was leaving behind his sociological research. As noted by his friend Botez, he showed himself to be \"absent-minded and preoccupied most of all with politics.\" Botez noted that Ralea was showing signs of hyperactivity, seemingly incapable of concentrating during formal functions. He became infamous as one of the \"traveling professors\", who lived in Bucharest and only taught the minimum of classes allowed in Iași—one of his return trips to Iași, in 1936, was for the funeral ceremony of his mentor Ibrăileanu. He now owned an Iași townhouse and a villa in Bucharest's Filipescu Park. Although lovingly married to Ioana, he had begun an affair with another woman, Marcela Simionescu.\n\nRalea's energies were also drawn into administrative disputes and professional rivalries. Alongside Brătianu, he fought to obtain Oțetea a permanent seat at the University of Iași, at the expense of PNȚ colleague Ioan Hudiță. He tried to do the same for Rosetti, but was met with the stiff opposition of linguist Giorge Pascu. Hudiță was particularly vexed by these maneuvers, and, in 1934, asked for a formal inquiry by Parliament, and even for a formal review of Ralea's own 1926 appointment. More privately, Hudiță also claimed that Ralea was having affairs with his female students, and even with younger girls who presented to Ralea for their baccalaureate examination. Such criticism did not dissuade Ralea. In 1937, he also managed to obtain an Iași University chair for Călinescu, in controversial circumstances.\nFrom 1934 to March 1938, Ralea was also editor of the main PNȚ newspaper, \"Dreptatea\". He contributed its political editorials, answering to criticism from the right. In February 1935, he co-authored and published the new PNȚ Party Program, which rendered explicit the goal of transforming Romania into a \"peasant state\". In \"Dreptatea\", addressing \"Universul\" editor Pamfil Șeicaru, Ralea dismissed suspicions that the \"peasant state\" signified a \"simplistic domination\" or a dictatorship of the peasantry. He maintained that the notion simply implied \"a juster distribution of the national income\", and the \"collective\" but peaceful \"redemption of an entire class.\"\n\nRalea's time at \"Dreptatea\" overlapped with the emergence of fascism, whose leading Romanian representatives were members of the Iron Guard. This violent movement had been temporarily banned in 1931, by order of a PNȚ Interior Minister, Ion Mihalache. Mihalache's ban followed repeated requests by the party's left-wingers, Ralea included. Ralea had his own brush with the Guard in late 1932, when he was presiding upon symposiums on French literature at \"Criterion Society\". One of the sessions, focusing on André Gide, was interrupted, on Crainic's instigation, by Guardsmen under Mihai Stelescu, who assaulted \"Criterion\" activists and created a bustle. By 1933, Ralea had quarreled with the \"Criterion\" cell, which had since adopted \"new generation\" idealism and sympathy for the Iron Guard. In private, he also dismissed the Guard's new convert and ideologue, Nae Ionescu, as a \"trickster\" and a \"barber\".\n\nThe issue of Romanian fascism became stringent after the Guard assassinated Romanian Premier Ion G. Duca. In his articles, Ralea described the National Liberal administration as \"insane and degenerate\" for continuing to tolerate the Guard's existence, instead of jailing its leaders. At \"Dreptatea\", protesting against the Guard's assault of the leftist intellectual Alexandru Graur, Ralea decried fascism in Romania as an \"island of Doctor Moreau\", an experiment in the growth of \"blind and absurd mysticism\".\n\nIn 1935, 161 of Ralea's essays were collected and published at Editura Fundațiilor Regale as \"Valori\" (\"Values\"). They predicted the emergence of a stable civilization, conformist and collectivist, whose great merit was the elimination of careerism. Ralea synthesized his critique of fascism in the 1935 essays on \"The Right's Doctrine\", taken up by \"Dreptatea\" and \"Viața Românească\". These texts described the far-right and fascism as parasitical phenomena, feeding on democracy's errors, with an ignorant mindset, incapable of subtlety. His assessments were countercriticized by Guardist intellectual Toma Vlădescu, in the newspaper \"Porunca Vremii\". According to Vlădescu, the \"right-wing ideology\" existed as an expression of the \"human equilibrium\", and, at its very core, was antisemitic.\n\nWith the advent of Nazi Germany and the invigoration of European fascism, Ralea was again moving to the left, cooperating with the Social Democratic Party (PSDR). In 1936, at \"Dreptatea\", he condemned the German march into Rhineland as a bad omen and an attack on world peace. He became one of the PNȚ men affiliated with Lord Cecil's International Peace Campaign, which, in Romania, was dominated by PSDR militants.\n\nIn 1937, with an obituary piece to the \"martyr\" Stere, he defended Poporanism from accusations of \"Bolshevik\" subservience. Bolshevism, he argued, was impossible in Romania. However, he himself had established a working relationship with the outlawed Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), who was also interested in other PNȚ antifascists (one of them was the White Lily's Pandrea, who had since joined the National Peasantist left current). Ralea also allowed PCdR intellectuals such as Ștefan Voicu and Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu to publish essays in \"Viața Românească\", and hosted news about social life and culture in the Soviet Union. At the time, the PCdR acknowledged him as one of the intellectuals who could be trusted with \"fulfilling the bourgeois revolution in Romania.\"\n\nIn January 1937, at the PNȚ Youth Conference in Cluj, Ralea spoke of the \"peasant state\" as a \"neo-nationalist\" application of democratic socialism, opposed to fascism, and in natural solidarity with the trade unions. He felt confident that this alliance would be powerful enough to outweigh fashionable totalitarianism. During April of that year, Ralea and his Iași colleagues expressed public solidarity with his old Poporanist friend Sadoveanu, whose books were being burned by far-right militants. Ralea's own sociological work was falling under Guardist scrutiny: in December, \"Buna Vestire\" hosted a piece by Horia Stamatu, which referred to Ralea's contribution as \"unhinged\", and to Ralea personally as \"kike-turned\", \"at odds with the new man\".\n\nThe December 1937 election toned down Ralea's anti-Guard militancy: the PNȚ had a non-aggression pact with the Guardsmen. Consequently, Ralea campaigned in his native Fălciu County alongside the movement's candidates, in terms he would later describe as \"cordial\". His apparent compromise with the Guard is one of the most serious charges in Pandrea's later criticism of Ralea. The tied elections, and the successes of the Guard, prompted the authoritarian King Carol II to increase his participation in politics, beyond his royal prerogative. Identified as one of the PNȚ \"turncoats\", Ralea sealed a surprising deal with Carol II and Premier Miron Cristea (the Patriarch of Romania), becoming the country's Minister of Labor. He was promptly stripped of his PNȚ membership, and inaugurated his own party, the exceedingly minor Socialist Peasants' Party (PSȚ).\n\nHistorians tend to describe Ralea's attitude toward Carol as \"servile\", and Ralea himself as Carol's \"pocket Socialist\" or \"intellectual trophy\". Ralea himself claimed that the king cultivated his friendship as a likable \"communist\", though, as Camelia Zavarache argues, there is no secondary proof to attest that Ralea was ever part of Carol's \"camarilla\". Iuliu Maniu, the PNȚ chief and leader of the semi-clandestine democratic opposition, suggested that Ralea had \"not a trace of character\" to compliment his intellectual gifts. At the time, PNȚ activists began collecting evidence that Ralea was not an ethnic Romanian, which meant that he could no longer hold public office under the Romanianization laws. Ralea himself was involved in the Romanianization campaign: in late 1938, he accepted Wilhelm Filderman's proposal for the mass emigration of Romanian Jews.\n\nIn December 1938, Ralea became a founding member of Carol's single party, the National Renaissance Front (FRN). The establishment offered him several honors, including a reprint of his works by the ministry press. In addition to his ministerial appointment, Ralea became Royal Resident, or governor, of Ținutul Prut, a new administrative region incorporating parts of Western Moldavia and Bessarabia. He was created a Knight 2nd Class of the \"Meritul Cultural\" Order, publishing, at Editura Fundațiilor Regale, the volume \"Psihologie și vieață\" (\"Psychology and Life\"). Toward the end of 1938, Ralea moved from his old chair at the University of Iași and took up a similar position at his Bucharest alma mater. Vianu was the assistant professor, lecturing in specialized aesthetics and literary criticism, and in practice taking over all of Ralea's classes.\n\nHistorian Lucian Boia argues: \"Of all the king's dictatorship dignitaries, one may count Mihai Ralea as the most left-wing.\" In Ralea's own view, the FRN regime was, overall, progressive: \"I had inaugurated a corpus of social reforms that were approved by the working class.\" As noted in 1945 by political scientist Hugh Seton-Watson, there was a cynical side to Ralea's reform-mindedness: \"however much [the average Romanian intellectual] cursed the regime, he was grateful to it for one thing. It stood between him and the great, dirty, primitive, disinherited masses, whose 'Bolshevik' desire for Social Justice threatened his comforts.\" His time in office brought the creation of a workers' leisure service, \"Muncă și Voe Bună\", together with a Workers' University, a workers' theater, and a hostel for vacationing writers (\"Casa Scriitorilor\"). Nepotistic in his selection of a ministerial staff, by November 1939 his ministry was able to co-opt PSDR politicians such as George Grigorovici and Stavri Cunescu. He appropriated socialist propaganda, and attracted more or less sizable contributions from various centrists and left-wingers: Sadoveanu, Vianu, Suchianu, Philippide, as well as Demostene Botez, Octav Livezeanu, Victor Ion Popa, Gala Galaction, Barbu Lăzăreanu, and Ion Pas.\n\nRalea's mandate was also a crossover of left-wing corporatism and fascism. In June 1938, he even visited Nazi Germany and had a formal meeting with his counterpart, Robert Ley. His \"Muncă și Voe Bună\" was directly inspired by Strength Through Joy and the \"Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro\". In 1939, Ralea celebrated May Day with a large parade of support for Carol II. This was meant to undermine the leftist Workers' Day while showing the success of the FRN's worker guilds, and was partly inspired by Nazi festivities. Nevertheless, the parade was voluntarily joined by militants of the underground PCdR, who found that it gave them am opportunity for chanting \"democratic slogans\". In underground PSDR circles, as well as in inside the ministerial structures, rumors spread that Ralea was using secret funds at his discretion to sponsor various PCdR militants, including his schoolmate Petre Constantinescu-Iași; these stories were partly confirmed by Ralea himself.\n\nFrom March 1939, the premiership had passed to Armand Călinescu, a former PNȚ politician. Ralea was his friend and confidant, and, as he later claimed, tried to keep Călinescu grounded in the face of \"mythomaniacal\" rumors. The FRN regime soon organized a massive clampdown of the Iron Guard. Ralea claimed to have protected Guardsmen employed by the Labor Ministry, and to have negotiated pardons for militants interned at Miercurea Ciuc. He obtained one such reprieve for Guardist historian P. P. Panaitescu. Himself a Guard sympathizer, Ion Barbu later claimed that Ralea was behind his marginalization in academia. Ralea was also accused by Pandrea of having done nothing to prevent the arrest of his former \"Dreptatea\" colleague, the anti-Carol PNȚ-ist Madgearu.\n\nOn September 21, 1939, following a spree of extrajudicial killings ordered by government, an Iron Guard death squad took its revenge, assassinating Premier Călinescu. Ralea, Andrei, and other former PNȚ-ists preserved their governmental posts as the premiership passed to Constantin Argetoianu, then to Gheorghe Tătărescu. Ralea was also given new responsibilities within the FRN structure, becoming president of its regional chapter in Ținutul Mării.\n\nMeanwhile, the outbreak of World War II caught Romania isolated from either the Axis Powers and the Western Allies. During the Battle of France, the FRN regime itself was divided between partisans of a détente with Germany and Francophiles such as Ralea. As witnessed by the Swiss diplomat René de Weck, Ralea was restating his \"Valori\" ethos at cabinet meetings, in front of Axis representatives, declaring that the Allies stood for \"humanistic civilization\". Former PCdR activists still enjoyed access to Ralea, through Constantinescu-Iași. In May 1940, the latter tried to create a bridge of communications between the Labor Minister and the Soviet Union. Various reports on both sides confirm that Ralea was in permanent contact with Soviet diplomats, arranged for him by Constantinescu-Iași and Belu Zilber.\n\nJust a month later, the Soviets issued an ultimatum, demanding that Romania cede Bessarabia. During the deliberations, Ralea voted in favor of Argetoianu's proposal: withdrawing from the region and mobilizing the army on the Prut, in preparation of a future defense. The subsequent occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina sent Romania into a deep political crisis. The events, and revelations about the existence of a Nazi–Soviet agreement, led Carol to order a final clampdown of the PCdR's remaining Romanian cells. In July, Ralea intervened to rescue a communist friend, the journalist George Ivașcu.\n\nThe Romanian crisis was aggravated in August, when the Nazi-inspired Vienna arbitration stripped her of Northern Transylvania. The political standstill propelled the Iron Guard, which was Nazi-aligned, into government, and forced Carol into permanent exile. The emerging \"National Legionary State\" banned reviews such as \"Viața Românească\", and moved to prosecute all former FRN dignitaries. With Panaitescu as the new Rector, the University instituted a Commission for Review, which included Iron Guard sociologist Traian Herseni and eugenicist Iordache Făcăoaru. Of those professors brought before the commission, Ralea was the only one to have his contract terminated without the possibility of transfer. Panaitescu, Herseni and Făcăoaru found that his appointment to Bucharest had been illegal, and dismissed his scientific contributions as having \"zero value\". Ralea and his colleagues were able to defend Vianu, who was openly Jewish, and who was threatened with demotion under the racial purity laws. Withdrawing to Huși, Ralea became the target of surveillance by agents of the Siguranța, who monitored his subversive conversations, including his wager that Guard rule would be short-lived.\n\nIn November 1940, the Guard's Police chief, Ștefan Zăvoianu, ordered the arrests of several FRN dignitaries, Ralea included. This angered the military \"Conducător\", Ion Antonescu, who freed Ralea and the others, ordering Zăvoianu to resign. After the clashes of January 1941, the Iron Guard was ousted, and Antonescu remained unchallenged. Although fascist, the new regime reinstated Ralea to his professorship. Antonescu castigated the Commission for Review as a \"shame\", and declared Ralea to be \"indispensable\". In a companion to Romanian philosophy, published that year, Herseni revised his stance, calling Ralea \"a thinker of unquestionable talent\", whose sociological work had been \"a true revelation.\" Ralea returned to teach at the University where, in addition to Vianu, he had received as his assistant a refugee from Soviet-occupied territory, Traian Chelariu. Meanwhile, Panaitescu was stripped of his position and briefly imprisoned.\n\nStill present in public life after the Romania's entry into the anti-Soviet war, Ralea returned to publishing with articles in \"Revista Românǎ\" and the 1942 book \"Înțelesuri\" (\"Meanings\"). Despite being partly recovered by the new regime, and allegedly proposing to Antonescu that they revive together the National Socialist Party, Ralea was still under \"Siguranța\" watch, and also spied on by the Police and the German Embassy. His file contains a denunciation of his entire career and loyalties: he stood accused of having been a \"socialist-communist\" camouflaged within the PNȚ, of having revived the guilds so as to give the PCdR room for maneuver, and of having sponsored Soviet agents to protect himself in the event of a Soviet invasion.\n\nOne \"Siguranța\" record suggests that, in secret, Ralea was hoping to consolidate a left-wing opposition movement against Antonescu during the early months of 1941. More alarmingly for the regime, Ralea had also begun cultivating a revolutionary and pro-Allied youth, through a new magazine called \"Graiul Nostru\" and with British funds. In February, Ralea was subjected to formal interrogations over his contacts with the PCdR under Carol. He defended these, arguing that he had aimed at securing a protective deal between Romania and the Soviets, and that Carol had approved of his effort. The explanation was viewed as plausible by police, and Ralea was allowed to go free. Nevertheless, the file was reopened by August, after revelations that Ralea had cultivated communists since at least the 1930s. In December 1942, Antonescu ordered Ralea's interment at the concentration camp in Târgu Jiu. He was held there for about three months, to March 1943, and apparently enjoyed a mild detention regime, with visitations.\n\nRalea's return from camp coincided roughly with the Battle of Stalingrad and the turn of fortunes on the eastern front. He soon established contacts with the antifascist opposition, repeatedly seeking to set up a Peasantist left and rejoin the PNȚ. Maniu received him and listened to his pleas, but denied him readmission and invited him to create his own coalition from shards of the Renaissance Front, promising him some measure of leniency \"for that hour when we shall be evaluating the past mistakes that have thrown this country into dejection.\" Their separation remained \"unbridgeable\"; eventually, Ralea reestablished the PSȚ, and attracted into its ranks a Social Democratic dissident faction, led by former PSDR theoretician Lothar Rădăceanu. The two reestablished contacts with the PCdR and other fringe parties: moving between Bucharest and Sinaia, Ralea was involved in trilateral talks between the communists, the Ploughmen's Front of Petru Groza, and the National Liberal inner faction of Gheorghe Tătărescu, helping to coordinate actions between them. In Brașov, he met with the economist Victor Jinga, whose antifascist and socialist program was reused in later PSȚ propaganda. Together with party colleague Stanciu Stoian, he signed the PSȚ's adherence to the PCdR's clandestine \"Patriotic Antihitlerite Front\".\n\nIn addition to such underground work, Ralea was notably involved in combating the nationalism and racism of the Antonescu years. He was one of several literary critics who publicly chided a colleague, George Călinescu, for publishing a 1941 treatise which included racialist profiles of Romanian writers, alongside criticism of Ralea's own anti-nationalism. With the 1943 collection of essays, \"Între două lumi\" (\"Between Two Worlds\", published at Cartea Românească), Ralea revised his earlier prophecies about the triumph of collectivism.\n\nEvidence of Ralea's participation in subversion was disregarded by government: in June 1943, when the German Foreign Ministry nominated Ralea as a high-risk target, Antonescu personally replied that this was not the case. In November, Ralea applied for a new Chair of Psychology at Bucharest, reserving his old department for Vianu. The review committee, overseen by leftist allies such as Gusti and Mircea Florian, gave him immediate approval for transfer. In February of the next year, Ralea and N. Bagdasar rejected the application of Constantin Noica, the traditionalist philosopher, to join the university teaching staff. In his report, Ralea noted that Noica had \"an absolute and metaphysical mindset\", with no \"practical reason\", and that he was therefore unsuited for research and teaching. He also appeared as a defense witness for Gheorghe Vlădescu-Răcoasa, an activist of the underground Union of Patriots. Together with Hudiță and other rival PNȚ-ists, and his friends in Iași academia, Ralea signed to Grigore T. Popa's manifesto of the intellectuals, demanding that Antonescu negotiate a separate peace with the Soviets. Reputedly, the document had been stripped of references to the prosecution of FRN and Antonescian officials, leading Maniu to conclude that the signers were \"cowardly\".\n\nAccording to Hudiță, Ralea objected to the Soviets' offer of an armistice as \"too soft\" on Romania. Blocked out of the National Democratic Bloc coalition, which included the PNȚ, the PSDR, and ultimately the PCdR, Ralea watched from the side as the August 23 Coup deposed Antonescu and pushed Romania into the anti-Nazi camp. His friend and PSȚ colleague, Grigore Geamănu, was more directly involved, helping PCdR leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej to escape from Târgu Jiu camp and join the other conspirators. In the PSȚ newspaper, \"Dezrobirea\", Ralea saluted \"the full triumph of the ideas and principles for which our foremost activists have been militating uninterruptedly these past six years\" (a pedigree which seemingly included Ralea's own activities under King Carol). He reissued \"Viața Românească\" with a similar statement about \"the present triumph of our credo\". Meanwhile, keeping up with his earlier threats, Maniu repeatedly asked for Ralea to be indicted for war crimes.\n\nRalea played an instrumental part in the gradual installation of communism, and is described by various authors as the prototype \"fellow traveler\". In December 1944, he was announced as the Literary Section Vice President of the Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union (ARLUS). His PSȚ was drawn into the National Democratic Front (FND) coalition, which comprised the PCdR, the Ploughmen's Front, and the Union of Patriots. According to the PCdR, this transformation of the Antihitlerite Front was \"a progressive step, befitting the tasks of the people's revolution\"; according to historian Adrian Cioroianu, it was more of opportunistic move on Ralea's part. In private, Ralea claimed that his alignment with the communists helped him provide for his large family, including former landowners, but his account is viewed as doubtful by Zavarache.\n\nRalea's Socialist Peasantists were eventually absorbed into the Ploughmen's Front. As noted by Zavarache, Ralea now understood that his influence on political life was \"exceedingly minor\", aware that Groza himself was merely a communist \"puppet\"; \"consequently, he sought to preserve those offices which could ensure him a comfortable lifestyle\". Like the rest of the FND, Ralea participated in the movement to depose the monarchist premier, General Nicolae Rădescu. Faced with the PCdR's obstructionism, Rădescu approached Ralea with an alternative offer: the Ploughmen's Front was to form a new government with no communist ministers. Ralea divulged this offer to the Soviet envoy, Andrey Vyshinsky. On February 16, 1945, together with 10 other academics (among them Balmuș, Parhon, Rosetti and Oțetea), he signed a letter of protest, accusing Rădescu of stalling land reform and of undermining the work of the Allied Commission.\n\nBloody clashes ensued in Bucharest, most of them between anticommunists and communist agents. They signaled a new political crisis, and forced the FND into power. Ralea was made Minister of Arts on March 6, 1945, when Groza took the premiership from the deposed General Rădescu. In June 1945 Ralea was one of the rapporteurs at the Ploughmen's Front largest-ever General Congress. On March 6, 1946, he also took over the Ministry of Religious Affairs, replacing the disgraced Constantin Burducea until August (when Groza himself replaced him in this function).\n\nRalea became one of several intellectuals who were mobilized to run on the Ploughmen's Front (and FND) list in the 1946 parliamentary election. In his capacity as minister, Ralea set in motion the purge of PNȚ-ist functionaries and of artists perceived by the PCdR as pro-fascist. He extended his personal protection to Șerban Cioculescu, who became Iași University professor in 1946 upon Ralea's intervention. Ralea also pursued his projects for workers' education, authorizing the establishment of a workers' theatrical troupe, \"Teatrul Muncitoresc CFR Giulești\". He also republished his 1930s travel accounts, completed with notes from his trip to Egypt, as \"Nord-Sud\" (\"North-South\").\n\nIn September 1946, Ralea stepped down from the Ministry of Arts, only to be appointed Ambassador to the United States. Reputedly, he was a last minute replacement for the Union of Patriots' Dumitru Bagdasar. The latter had fallen severely ill, but was also seen as a political liability by the American side—Ralea, as a former monarchist, was preferable. Ralea's own arrival in Washington was delayed by his inclusion on the Romanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, and he finally landed on American soil in October. He supported a détente in Romanian–American relations, after President Harry S. Truman had refused to recognize the Groza cabinet. In front of American criticism, he played down the electoral fraud of 1946, claiming that it was within the \"normal\" boundaries, at some 5% of the vote.\n\nRalea was also tasked with undermining the reputation of the anticommunist opposition and with popularizing communism among Romanian American exiles. The anticommunist press responded by calling Ralea \"a liaison man\" of the Politburo, tasked with planting Stalinism in America. Among expatriate Romanians, Ralea and his legation staff had difficulties convincing Maruca and George Enescu, but persuaded Dimitrie Gusti to return to Bucharest. Ralea also approached the former backers of Carol's regime. He build a connection with the industrialist Nicolae Malaxa, but found vocal adversaries in Max Auschnitt and Richard Franasovici.\n\nGoing against Soviet policies and his own government, Ralea also sought to obtain American foreign aid, and even political interventions. His persistence in this regard contributed to the relief effort organized by General Schuyler in famine-stricken Western Moldavia. However, the assistance fell below Ralea's expectations, owing to various factors, one of which was American suspicion that Groza was diverting food to relieve the Soviet famine; meanwhile, diaspora voices repeatedly argued that Ralea was playing down the scale of famine, and also insinuated that he was embezzling funds. In his reports to Bucharest, Ralea complained that: \"America's attitude toward us was oscillating between hostility and ignorance. All doors were closed. [...] We were seen as a Soviet branch office, and people were discouraged from giving us any sort of assistance.\" Reportedly, he was shocked by Truman's ignorance of Romanian affairs. Ralea's diplomatic mission was also tainted by his difficult lifestyle, including his noticeable hypochondriasis, but also his philandering. Ralea had appointed his mistress as cultural attaché, but she deserted her post and left to Mexico while Ioana Ralea took up residence in the Romanian embassy.\n\nWith the looming threat of Soviet-style collectivization, Ralea informed the Americans that Romanian peasants valued individual property. Reportedly, during his January 1947 interview with US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes, he pleaded emotionally for Romanians not to be left \"behind the Iron Curtain\". He was still the country's ambassador when King Michael I was forced to abdicate by the PCdR officials and a communized people's republic was proclaimed. Nevertheless, Foreign Minister Ana Pauker greatly reduced his influence in Washington, transferring many of his attributes to a communist diplomat, Grigore Preoteasa. In June, Ralea also became chairman of a Romanian Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations, which was dedicated to the spread of propaganda.\n\nA scandal erupted in July 1948, when the Raleas were denied access to the diplomats' beach in Newport, having been blacklisted as \"communists\". Ioana Ralea endangered her husband's position by protesting against this qualifier; at home, rumor spread that the couple was planning to defect. Ralea was able to persuade Pauker not to recall him, and even organized a reception in her honor during October 1948; he also organized a communist counter-manifestation upon Michael's arrival to Washington. While still abroad, Ralea had run in the formal election of March 1948, taking a Fălciu seat in the Great National Assembly. This allowed him to return to a secure position after Mihai Magheru took over as Ambassador, in late 1949.\n\nResuming his scholarly work, Ralea had to refrain from calling himself a \"sociologist\", as that field of research had been declared \"reactionary\". He was again given the position of psychology chair at the University of Bucharest, and was also made a member of the new Institute of History and Philosophy, whose president was Constantinescu-Iași. Ralea was seconded there by Constantin Ionescu Gulian, with whom he did research into the history of Romanian materialist philosophy. He also prepared an anthropological tract, \"Explicarea omului\" (\"Explaining Man\"). Translated into the French by Eugène Ionesco, it was published at Presses Universitaires de France. In November 1948, he had been accepted into the recently purged Romanian Academy, at the same time as Balmuș, Raluca Ripan, Grigore Moisil, Ștefan Milcu, Camil Petrescu, and PCdR historian Mihail Roller. A contributor to the PCdR daily, \"Scînteia\", as well as to its youth supplement and its cultural reviews (\"Studii\", \"Contemporanul\", etc.), Ralea also sat on the editorial staff of the Academy Historical Section's trimonthly, \"Buletin Științific\", alongside Roller, David Prodan, and Constantin Moisil.\n\nNevertheless, the Workers' Party (as the PCdR was known after absorbing the PSDR) was collecting evidence incriminating Ralea. In October 1949, taking its cue from Roller and Leonte Răutu, the party press carried notes critical of Ralea and Gulian's research. The following year, Roller suggested that Ralea's introduction to the works of Vasile Conta was not up to Marxist standards, and also hinted that Ralea held too many offices. The Securitate secret police opened a file on him, which recorded his criticism of Roller and other \"ignoramuses\" promoted by the regime; in exchange, the Securitate labeled Ralea \"opportunistic\" and \"a danger to our regime.\" From about 1950, his office at the Institute was infiltrated by informants, and probably also bugged.\n\nRalea responded to the pressures by presenting his services as an anti-American propagandist, making his first-hand experience in America into an irreplaceable asset; this assignment was inaugurated in January 1951, when Ralea and Gulian published in \"Studii\" a piece addressing the immorality of \"American imperialists\". Working under direct Soviet supervision, Ralea took charge of a research project endorsed by the entire Institute: \"Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman al psihologiei americane\" (\"The Anti-Science and Anti-Humanity Nature of American Psychology\", published 1954). He was again able to rescue Vianu, this time from communist persecution, and intervened to save the career of writer Costache Olăreanu. More discreetly, he paid the bills of his former teacher, Rădulescu-Motru, who had been expelled from academia, and rescued from eviction the conductor George Georgescu. However, he could not protect either his brother-in-law Suchianu, who was arrested and held in communist prisons, nor Chelariu, who was sacked and had to work as a rat-catcher. His disciple, psycholinguist Tatiana Slama-Cazacu, was forced to abandon her doctorate studies because of her political nonconformism.\n\nRalea still had friendly contacts with his former supervisors in Foreign Affairs, though he complained to his peers that Pauker was snubbing him. Pandrea, who had fallen out with the Workers' Party regime and spent time in prison, later alleged that Ralea, \"the impenitent servant\", cultivated the friendship of communist women, from Pauker to Liuba Chișinevschi. Ralea witnessed Pauker's 1952 downfall and banishment, and reputedly kept himself informed about her activities through mutual acquaintances. His own survival in the post-Pauker era was an unusual feat. According to Pandrea, it was possible only because Ralea was \"without scruples\", always ready for a \"cowardly submission\", and a \"valet\" of Workers' Party potentates such as Ion Gheorghe Maurer. As a sign that he was still protected by the regime, in February 1953 Ralea was awarded the Star of the People's Republic, Second Class. A close bond existed between Ralea and the Workers' Party chief, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, who began cultivating his very own intellectual circle after engineering Pauker's downfall.\n\nThe death of Joseph Stalin in early 1953 signaled a path toward less dogmatism. This initially hurt Ralea: \"Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman\", now seen as embarrassing, was not given mass circulation. Nevertheless, Ralea supported Gheorghiu-Dej's adoption of a national communist platform, which was presented as an alternative to Soviet control. Over the early 1950s, he had grown disgusted and alarmed by the impact of communist policies in education, but still fearful of approaching the topic in his dealings with communist potentates. In 1955, with the relaxation of political pressures, he went public with his criticism, issued as a report to the Workers' Party leadership. It spoke about the poor scientific standards at Romania's universities, and criticized the appointment of political workers as school principals. The report also condemned the Art Ministry for promoting \"mediocrities\" as cultural inspectors, but avoided any proposal for actual liberalization. By 1957, the Romanian school of psychology had been relaunched, and its official publications recommended Ralea as a main reference, but without mentioning \"Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman\". At the time, some Romanian anticommunist circles also began taking an interest in Ralea, vainly hoping that he would be appointed premier of a post-Stalinist Romania.\n\nIn 1956, the psychology section became an independent Institute, and Ralea became its chairman. Also that year, Ralea published his historical essay on French politics and culture, \"Cele două Franțe\" (\"The Two Frances\"). It came out in a 1959 French edition, as \"Les Visages de France\", with a preface by Roger Garaudy. Ralea was also one of the select few Romanians, most of them trusted figures of the regime, who could reissue selections from their interwar literary contributions, at the specialized state company Editura de Stat pentru Literatură și Artă. Ralea was one of the first in this series, with the 1957 \"Scrieri din trecut\" (\"Writings from the Past).\n\nUnder a similar understanding with the regime, Ralea and other dignitaries could publish accounts of their travels in capitalist countries—in Ralea's case, the 1959 \"În extremul occident\" (\"Into the Far West\"). It had comments on the \"iron fisted rule\" of the United Fruit, and gibes at \"the putrefied lazy specimens\" of \"exploiters\" in pre-communist Cuba. Ralea was nevertheless active in reintegrating culturally some intellectuals who had been imprisoned and rehabilitated: together with one such figure, Constantin I. Botez, he wrote the 1958 \"Istoria psihologiei\" (\"History of Psychology\"). According to memoirist C. D. Zeletin, Ralea and Vianu had a \"courageous and noble\" stand after the student protest of 1956: acting together, they obtained the release from Securitate custody of Dumitru D. Panaitescu, son of the critic Perpessicius.\n\nRalea and his family lived at a luxurious villa on Washington Street, Dorobanți. In 1961, he had been re-inducted into the literary canon, mentioned in official manuals as one of sixteen critics whose work supported \"socialist construction\". Around that time, Ralea and Vianu mounted campaign for Marxist humanism, and were elected to the National Board of UNESCO (Ralea was its vice president). Their actions were condemned at the time by the exile writer Virgil Ierunca, who described their \"solemn agitation\" as a new ruse on the part of Gheorghiu-Dej. Ralea was also sent abroad with a dossier on exile writer Vintilă Horia, who had received the Prix Goncourt. It showed evidence of Horia's support for interwar fascism. Ralea's mission was hampered by revelations about his own compromises with fascism, published in \"Le Monde\", \"Paris-Presse\" and the Romanian diaspora press, under such titles as: \"Ralea used to lift his arm really high\". According to later assessments, the Horia affair and Ralea's participation therein were instrumented by the Securitate.\n\nAdhering to the official cultural policy, Ralea was making efforts to be admitted into the Workers' Party. His application was politely turned down, but he was honored with the vice presidency of the Great National Assembly Presidium and a seat on the republican Council of State. In 1962, Ralea was one of the guest speakers at a Geneva conference on the generation gap, alongside Louis Armand, Claude Autant-Lara, and Jean Piaget. Also that year, he helped with the recovery and reemployment of a former rival, Traian Herseni. Reportedly, Ralea excused Herseni's Iron Guard affiliation as a careerist move rather than a political crime. Together, they published \"Sociologia succesului\" (\"The Sociology of Success\"); Herseni used the pseudonym \"Traian Hariton\". Despite such interventions, Ralea was publicly shamed by the dissident poet Păstorel Teodoreanu, who nicknamed him the communist \"Viceroy\", or \"Immo-Ralea\".\n\nAccording to his younger colleague George C. Basiliade, Ralea was an \"unfulfilled sybarite\", whose luxurious lifestyle did not fit his physical frame and his background. A heavy smoker, and prone to culinary excesses, Ralea checked himself in Otopeni hospital showing symptoms of facial nerve paralysis, with hypertension and fatigue. Against the advice of his doctors, he decided to attend a UNESCO meeting in Copenhagen. He died aboard the train, outside East Berlin, on the morning of August 17, 1964. His body was transported back to Bucharest, and buried at Bellu cemetery. Ralea and Herseni had been working on a textbook, \"Introducere în psihologia socială\" (\"Companion to Social Psychology\"), which only saw print in 1966.\n\nAs seen by Zavarache, Ralea was a man of \"outstanding intelligence\" with an \"encyclopedic knowledge, tightly aligned with the rhythms of Western culture.\" Ralea's contemporaries left remarks on not just his hyperactivity, but also his neglect of details, and his eclecticism. Pompiliu Constantinescu remarked of \"petulant\" Ralea: \"Here is a soul who will not stand for the label of specialization!\" In 1926, Eugen Lovinescu dismissed Ralea as \"a fecund ideologue, paradoxical in his association and dissociation of varied and superficial ideals that have happened to have points of contact with Romanian literature.\" He reads both Ralea and Suchianu as displays of \"useless erudition\" and \"failure of logic\". Completing this verdict, Monica Lovinescu saw Ralea as \"not truly a literary critic\", but \"a sociologist, a psychologist, a moralist—a moralist with no morals, and yet a moralist\". More leniently, George Călinescu noted that Ralea was an \"epicurean\" of \"vivid intelligence\", who only chronicled \"books that he has enjoyed reading\". His free associations of concepts were \"very often surprising, quite often admirable\". Ralea, Călinescu proposes, was Romania's own \"little Fontenelle\".\n\nAfter his French sojourn, Ralea infused Poporanism and collectivism with both Durkheim's corporatism and Marx's theory of \"class consciousness\". In his earliest work, he also referenced Ludwig Gumplowicz's ideas about the fundamental inequality of class-based societies. These references helped him build a critique of innate \"class solidarity\" as presumed by early corporatism, and also of Proudhon's mutualist economics. Despite this collectivist-functionalist outlook, and although he spoke out against art for art's sake, Ralea was adamant that strictly sociological explanations of creativity were doomed to fail. As he put it, all attributes of a writer were \"subsidiary to [his] creative originality\".\n\nRalea reduced aestheticism and social determinism to the basic units of \"aesthetics\" and \"ethnicity\". As he saw it, an ethnic consciousness was biologically and psychologically necessary: it helped structure perception, giving humans a reference point between the particularity and generality. An artist, Ralea argued in 1925, was \"obliged\" to address the national society he lived in, \"at the present stage in civilization\": \"If he were human, he would be discarding specificity itself, that is to say the very essence of art, and would fall into science; if he were too specific, too original, he'd stand to lose his means of expression, the point of contact with his public\". Ralea believed that the origin of beauty was biological, before being human or social; he also claimed (questionably so, according to art critic Petru Comarnescu) that traditional society allowed no depiction of ugliness before the arrival of Christian art.\n\nWith this analysis of aesthetic principles, borrowing from Henri Bergson, Ralea toned down his own rationalism and determinism, taking in relativism and intuitionism. With his respect for critical intuition, his critique of determinism, and his cosmopolitanism, he came unexpectedly close to the aestheticism of his rival Lovinescu, and, though him, to the \"aesthetic autonomism\" of Titu Maiorescu. Ralea even sketched out his own relativist theory, according to which works of art could have limitless interpretations (or \"unforeseen significances\"), thus unwittingly paralleling, or anticipating, the semiotics of Roland Barthes. With \"Între două lumi\", he still rejected individualism and subjectivity, but also nuanced his corporatist collectivism. As he noted, militancy in favor of either philosophy had sparked the modern crisis. The solution, Ralea suggested, was for man to rediscover the simple joys of anonymity.\n\nIn his essay \"Fenomenul Românesc\" (\"The Romanian Phenomenon\"), Ralea elaborated on the issue of Romanian national psychology. He understood this as a natural development of Dimitrie Gusti's sociological \"science of the nation\", but better suited to the topic and more resourceful. According to Ralea, Romanians were structurally opposed to mysticism, which could not compliment their true character: \"good-natured, even-minded, sharp-witted like all meridional men, [and] extremely lucid.\" The \"Romanian soul\" was therefore an adaptable and pragmatic entity, mixing a Western propensity for action with a Levantine fatalism. Combating antisemitism, Ralea applied this theory to the issue of European Jewish intelligence: quoting Werner Sombart, he deduced that the \"rationalist\", \"progressive\" and \"utilitarian\" essence of Jewishness was socially determined by the Jews' participation in capitalist competition.\n\nAlthough Ralea was personally responsible for establishing a laboratory of experimental psychology at Iași, he in fact abhorred experimental methods, and preferred to rely on intuition. As a theorist, he gave a humanistic praise to dilettantism and vitality, in the face of philosophical sobriety. He commended Ion Luca Caragiale, the creator of modern Romanian humor, as the voice of lucidity, equating irony with intelligence. As noted by Călinescu, Ralea \"either intentionally or unconsciously [suggests] that intense flippancy is in fact sobriety\". Ralea did have his uncertainties about the grounding of his own idea. Caragiale's humor risked making Romanians too accepting of their superficiality: \"maybe this genius portraitist of our bourgeoisie has done us a great harm\". During his polemic with \"Sburătorul\" modernism, Ralea attacked the new schools of aesthetics for their artificiality and obsessiveness: \"Not one of the truly terrible chapters in life is familiar to [the modernists]. They are not humans, just clowns. [...] Only the demented and children are unilateral. True aesthetics expresses the mature and normal spiritual functions. The alternative is comparative or infantile aesthetics\". According to Monica Lovinescu, his critique of \"lassitude\" and \"cowardice\" in urban life is \"a severe diagnostic of his own disease.\"\n\nOn such grounds, Ralea concluded that Romanian writers \"have had no deep spiritual experience\", lacking \"a comprehension of humanity, of life and death.\" In a notorious socio-critical essay, first published in \"Perspective\", Ralea asked: \"Why Did We Not Produce a Novel?\". He contended that the grand epic genre, unlike the short story, did not yet suit the Romanian psyche, since it required discipline, anonymity, and a \"great moral significance\". He also postulated a deterministic relationship between the staples of ancestral Romanian folklore and modern literary choices: in the absence of any ambitious poetic cycles (as found in Western literature), Romanian ballads and \"doine\" had naturally mutated into novellas. In order to mend such a historical disadvantage, he set himself the goal of writing his own novel, but eventually gave up on the idea. At the time of its writing, the essay claimed to count only a few living novelists; by 1935, however, there was already talk of an \"inflation of novels\".\n\nIn a 1945 interview with writer Ion Biberi, Ralea explained himself as a Marxist humanist, influenced by André Malraux and by unspecified \"recent Russian doctrinaires\". Expanding on his earlier stances, he understood the socialist mode of production as both desirable and inevitable, to be received with \"enthusiasm\" by the masses: \"[it] provides practically infinite production opportunities, because it excludes personal gain and is no longer dominated by the game of markets, of supply and demand.\" He conceived of a socialism wherein \"man, integrated with communal life, shall have full liberty in his actions\". However, according to political scientist Ioan Stanomir, Ralea's discourse is to be read as a \"celebration of slavery\".\n\nThe transformation was accelerated during Ralea's last 15 years of life. Around 1950, Ralea was studying Marxist aesthetics and Marxist literary criticism, advising young literati, and his colleague Vianu, to do the same. Ralea was also going back on his cosmopolitanism, seeing it as an obstacle to the proper understanding of Romanian society. His teaching aid for social psychology was similarly adjusted, introducing chapters on \"class psychology\", though, as Zavarache argues, these modifications were \"surprisingly kept to a minimum\". Especially in his reedited \"Scrieri din trecut\", Ralea sought to reconcile Ibrăileanu's social Darwinism with the official readings of Marxism, as well as with Michurinism and Pavlovianism.\n\nShaped by political command, \"Caracterul antiștiințific și antiuman\" excoriated American psychologists as tools of the capitalist regime, claiming that capitalism cultivated \"force\", \"triviality\", and \"sexual debauchery\"; Ralea also stated his outrage at the absence of socialized health care in the United States, even though he privately explained that American workers led \"satisfactory\" lives. To his peers, Ralea complained that \"the adoption of a Marxist canon was stifling his ability to interpret\", and therefore prevented him from \"elaborating valuable papers.\" He \"doubtlessly never imagined that there would be such excess and distortion\", and tried to persuade communist censors not to exaggerate his works' anti-Americanism.\n\nIn \"Explicarea omului\", Vianu notes, Ralea brought up \"a fundamental cultural motif, man's urge to create himself \"obstacles\" and consequently break through them with his natural instinct [Vianu's emphasis].\" According to Ralea, brute ethics existed as \"a mechanism for social self-regulation\", which helped to distill the \"vital impulse\", whereas the accomplished human being would internalize its requirements and verify them against his own rationality. Overall, Ralea contended that \"dialectical materialism has the complete answer to any fundamental issue regarding social structuring\". That answer was in \"superstructures\", and the references were Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, alongside Ludwig Klages and Max Scheler. According to philosopher François Evain, Ralea's study failed as a work of psychological anthropology, and merely showed \"what superstructures become under Marxist materialism.\" Contrarily, critic Antonio Patraș noted the links between \"Explicarea omului\" (a \"brilliant study\") and Ralea's earlier contributions to sociology.\n\n\"Sociologia succesului\" was to some extent dependent on Ralea's study of Durkheim's \"Division of Labor\", with its distinction between laws of punishment and laws of restitution (or reward). Ralea maintained that remedial sanctions were a characteristic of modern civilized society, and that the social fact of \"success\" was created within that setting. However, the work was heavily reliant on Marxist sociology, hypothesizing that socialist societies had perfected new incentives for workers to set collective objectives and succeed at them. According to psychologist Edgar Krau, Ralea and Herseni gave credibility to \"the tenet that the individualistic ethics of capitalism disunites and hurts people\"; however, they ignored the reality of communism, which was \"not [its] collectivism, but the all-pervading party tuition\". In Romania, \"Sociologia succesului\" was mainly noted for reintegrating professional (albeit antiquated) references to American psychology and sociology. It marked a fundamental step in the restoration of Romanian sociology, and also allowed Ralea to publish again on a subject which had preoccupied him since 1944.\n\nRalea was survived by his only child, daughter Catinca Ralea (1929–1981). In her twenties, she cultivated a literary circle which included poet Geo Dumitrescu. She also had a career in letters, before becoming a Radio Romania International reporter and Romanian Television producer. In 1969, Catinca provided live coverage of the Apollo 11 mission, including the first Moon landing. Additionally, she is remembered for her translations from J. D. Salinger (which fed Romania's counterculture of the 1960s) and J. R. R. Tolkien. With Eugenia Cîncea, she completed a best-selling translation of \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\", which had five editions between 1962 and 1982. Against her father's wish, she married in 1958 the actor Emanoil Petruț, who survived her by two years.\n\nMihai Ralea's death, coinciding with a spell of liberalization, created unexpected room for maneuver for a younger generation of literary critics and historians, who were anti-sociological, subjectivist, and post-structuralist. Nevertheless, some members of this intellectual school, such as Adrian Marino and Matei Călinescu, continued to draw inspiration from Ralea, having rediscovered his early Bergsonian essays. They were joined in this by Alexandru Ivasiuc, the novelist and Marxist literary theorist. From within the anti-communist movement, Ralea was defended by author Nicolae Steinhardt. Although a devout Orthodox, Steinhardt treasured the non-believers Ralea and Paul Zarifopol for their \"quick wit\".\n\nAfter the 1989 Revolution and the fall of communism, Ralea's Dobrina estate was transferred by government order to the Orthodox Diocese of Huși, and came to host a convent. His Dorobanți villa, which Catinca Ralea had sold, bears a memorial plaque honoring the sociologist. By Government Act 503/1998, the Romanian Academy Institute of Psychology was renamed \"Mihai Ralea Institute\". The Huși library, also named after Ralea, has been hosting the entire corpus of his works since 2013.\n\nRalea's early sociological writings were republished, as \"Fenomenul Românesc\", in 1997. By then, his sociological contribution was being reassessed in various ways, leading to a reissue of his essays as a 1997 volume, put out by Constantin Schifirneț at Editura Albatros. Around 1995, a heated public debate erupted, focusing on the careers of leftist intellectuals such as Ralea, and their supposed acts of self-betrayal. The central question, brought up by researcher Marin Nițescu, was: would they have done better not to publish at all under communism? In 2010, a group of sociologists defended Ralea's prestige, noting that \"we [Romanians] are inexcusably delaying in recognizing Mihai Ralea's sociological contribution\".\n"}

Phase three will be to find jobs for all rehabilitated offenders. Its biggest impact is on Salt Lake's homeless population, as the neighborhood has a very high density of homeless people and homeless services. The two year cost to fund the operation is estimated at .\n\nOperation Rio Grande started its three phase rollout on August 14, 2017 in the Rio Grande neighborhood of Salt Lake City, Utah. The first phase was enforcement of laws. Part of the operation included an order from Salt Lake City Mayor Jackie Biskupski, shutting down Rio Grande Street permanently to vehicles and pedestrians to create a drug free zone. Mayor Biskupski stalled the closure for three weeks while she took public comment and went through city processes. Utah state Governor Gary Herbert has called the state legislature into a special session to discuss the various aspects of the massive crackdown and intervention.\n\nThe operation has led to over 1000 arrests including persons that are homeless, and drug dealers. Agencies participating are the Utah Department of Public Safety, state probation and parole officers, Utah Highway Patrol, social workers, and lawyers. The operation has also led to arrests in Ogden, Utah. Out of the over 1000 people arrested, 676 non-violent offenders were released because of jail overcrowding, ability to obtain bail or to attend court dates. Most of the charges were for misdemeanors. Of the arrestees, 35 have been identified as being eligible for Salt Lake's drug court. One person declined the offer of drug court. Each qualified arrestee must go to a drug bed for long-term addiction treatment. Completion of drug court means that any current and previous drug charges will be expunged from their record.\n\nThe purge is causing a spillover into outlying neighborhoods. It is also causing spillover into southern Utah and authorities there are worried about collateral impact such as theft, vandalism, loitering, trespassing, drug dealing, public intoxication, and violence.\n\nUtah House Speaker Greg Hughes and Department of Public Safety Commissioner Keith Squires also emphasized that the law enforcement prong of Operation Rio Grande—its name aside—won't be confined to the Rio Grande area. If wrongdoers \"run and try to hide at the Jordan River, we're going to the Jordan River. If they're going to South Salt Lake, we're going to South Salt Lake. West Valley—were going there,\" Hughes said. \"This is not about a geographic area, per se, as it is what has hurt this community, the state and the people that live in it. And we're going to eradicate that.\"\n\nThe house speaker, and also Utah Lieutenant Governor Spencer Cox estimate the two year cost of the operation to be $67million.\n\n"}

The solar terms are also used to calculate intercalary months in East Asian calendars; which month is repeated depends on the position of the sun at the time.\n\nBecause the Sun's speed along the ecliptic varies depending on the Earth-Sun distance, the number of days that it takes the Sun to travel between each pair of solar terms varies slightly throughout the year.

Each pentad consists of five, rarely six, days, and are mostly named after phenological (biological or botanical) phenomena corresponding to the pentad.\n\nSolar terms originated in China, then spread to Korea, Vietnam, and Japan, countries in the East Asian cultural sphere.

Archaeologists prize tamgas as a first-rate source for the study of present and extinct cultures.\n\nSince the time when the ancients, including the Mongol nations have developed into relative groups, origins, and ethnic groups, the symbol and belief of a clan have emerged, and a custom to distinguish their origins and relatives have been established. Consequently, when labor distributions within clans began to develop and people started to manage an economy, various tamgas, drawings, notes and earmarks have been used as an identification sign for labor instruments and utilities as well as in domestication of animals. Every time the clan branched off due to internal clashes, the number of derivative tamghas gradually developed into personal, family, lineage, khans, and state tamghas. Those new tamghas were created through adding new markings on the original tamgha, in order to conserve the tradition. In the Mongol Empire a Tamgha was a seal placed on taxed items, and by extension, a tax on commerce.(and see Eastern Europe below) \n\n\"Tamga\" or \"tamag\" literally means a stamp or seal in the Mongolian language. Tamgas are also stamped using hot irons on domesticated animals such as horses in present-day Mongolia and others to identify that the livestock belongs to a certain family while they graze during the day on their own. In this regard, each family has their own tamga markings for easier identification. Tamga marking in that case is not very elaborate and is just a curved iron differentiating from other families' tamgas. The President of Mongolia also passes the \"tamag\" \"state seal\" when he or she transitions the position to the new president. In the presidential case, the tamag or seal is a little more elaborate and is contained in a wooden box.\n\nThe Turks who remained pastoral nomad kings in eastern Anatolia and Iran however, continued to use their clan tamgas, and in fact they became high-strung nationalistic imagery. The Ak Koyunlu and Kara Koyunlu, like many other royal dynasties in Eurasia, put their tamga on their flags and stamped their coinage with it.\n\nFor those Turks who never left their homeland of Turkestan in the first place it remained and still is what it was originally, a cattle brand and clan identifier.\n\nAmong modern Turkic peoples, the tamga is a design identifying property or cattle belonging to a specific Turkic clan, usually as a cattle brand or stamp.\n\nWhen Turkish clans took over more urban or rural areas, tamgas dropped out of use as pastoral ways of life became forgotten. This is most evident in the Turkish clans who took over western and eastern Anatolia following the Battle of Manzikert. The Turks who took over western Anatolia founded the Sultanate of Rûm and became Roman-style aristocrats. Most of them adopted the (at the time) Muslim symbol of the Seal of Solomon after the Sultanate disintegrated into a mass of feuding ghazi states (see Isfendiyarids, Karamanids). Only the Ottoman ghazi state (later to become the Ottoman Empire) kept its tamga, and this was highly stylized, so much so that the bow was stylized down eventually to a crescent moon.\n\nTamgas of the twenty-two Oghuz tribes according to Mahmud al-Kashgari in Dīwānu l-Luġat al-Turk:\n\nIn Russia, the term \"tamga\" (\"тамга\") survived in state institution of border customs, with associated cluster of terms: \"tamozhnya\" (\"таможня\", customs), \"tamozhennik\" (\"таможенник\", customs officer), \"rastamozhit\"' (\"растаможить\", pay customs duties), derived from the use of tamga as a certificate of state.\n\nColumns of Gediminas, an early coat of arms of Lithuania, may be a tamga.\n\nIn the late medieval Turco-Mongol states, the term \"tamga\" was used for any kind of official stamp or seal. This usage persisted in the early modern Islamic Empires (Ottoman Empire, Mughal Empire), and in some of their modern successor states.\n\nIn the Urdu language (which absorbed Turkic vocabulary), \"Tamgha\" is used as medal. Tamgha-i-Jurat is the fourth highest Military medal of Pakistan. It is admissible to all ranks for gallantry and distinguished services in combat. Tamgha-i-Imtiaz or Tamgha-e-Imtiaz (), which translates as \"medal of excellence\", is fourth highest honour given by the Government of Pakistan to both the military and civilians. Tamgha-i-Khidmat or Tamgha-e-Khidmat (), which translates as \"medal of services\", is seventh highest honour given by the Government of Pakistan to both the military and civilians. It is admissible to non-commissioned officers and other ranks for long meritorious or distinguished services of a non-operational nature.\nIn Egypt, the term \"damgha\" () or \"tamgha\" () is still used in two contexts. One is a tax or fee when dealing with the government. It is normally in the form of stamps that have to be purchased and affixed to government forms, such as a driver license or a registration deed for a contract. The term is derived from the Ottoman damga resmi. Another is a stamp put on every piece of jewelry made from gold or silver to indicate it is genuine, and not made of baser metals.\n\n\n"}

It is the only volume of poetry by Plath that was published before her death in 1963.\n\nThe 44 poems presented here are in the published order. The list below contains the poems published in the US version of the collection, which omits several poems from the original UK edition, including most of the seven sections of \"Poem for a Birthday\", only two of which (\"Flute Notes from a Reedy Pond\" and \"The Stones\") are included in the US edition. The title \"The Colossus\" comes from \"Kolossus\" a character who appeared in the ouija board games of Plath and Ted Hughes directing her to write poems on certain topics.\n\n\nProminent journalist, poet and literary critic for \"The Observer\" newspaper, Al Alvarez, called the posthumous re-release of the book, after the success of \"Ariel\", a \"major literary event\" and wrote of Plath's work:\n\n\"She steers clear of feminine charm, deliciousness, gentility, supersensitivity and the act of being a poetess. She simply writes good poetry. And she does so with a seriousness that demands only that she be judged equally seriously... There is an admirable no-nonsense air about this; the language is bare but vivid and precise, with a concentration that implies a good deal of disturbance with proportionately little fuss.\"\nSeamus Heaney said of \"The Colossus\": \"On every page, a poet is serving notice that she has earned her credentials and knows her trade.\" \n"}
{"id": "8624309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8624309", "title": "Tomb of Benei Hezir", "text": "Tomb of Benei Hezir\n\nThe Tomb of Benei Hezir () is the oldest of four monumental rock-cut tombs that stand in the Kidron Valley, Jerusalem and dates to the period of the Second Temple. It is a complex of burial caves. The tomb was originally accessed from a single rock-cut stairwell which descends to the tomb from the north. At a later period an additional entrance was created by quarrying a tunnel from the courtyard of the monument known as \"the Tomb of Zechariah\". This is also the contemporary entrance to the burial complex.\n\nThe facade of the tomb is a classical distyle in antis with two pillars between two pilasters above which there is undecorated architrave containing an engraved a Hebrew inscription. Above the architrave is a Doric frieze and a cornice. The tomb's architectural style is influenced by ancient Greek architecture only (two pillars with Doric capitals), without ancient Egyptian architectural influences.\n\nThe tomb dates to the second century BCE, the Hellenistic period and the time of the Hasmonean monarchy in Jewish history. Architecturally the so-called Tomb of Zechariah postdates the complex, and the Tomb of Absalom is considered to have been erected even later. The tomb is effectively a burial cave dug into the cliff. It contains a Hebrew inscription, which makes it clear that this was the burial site of a priestly family called Benei Hezir, lit. \"sons [descendants] of Hezir\". The inscription reads:\n\nזה הקבר והנפש שלאלעזר חניה יועזר יהודה שמעון יוחנן בני יוסף בן עובד יוסף ואלעזר בני חניה כהנים מבני חזיר — This is the grave and the \"Nefesh\" (burial monument) of Eliezer Hania Yoazar Yehuda Shimon Yochanan Benei (sons of) Yosef Ben (son of) Oved Yosef and Elazar Benei (sons of) Hania, Kohanim of the Hezir family.\n\nThe name Hezir appears twice in the Bible (see below). The inscription on the monument mentions the \"sons of Hezir\", meaning: the descendants of Hezir. The Hebrew term is \"bnei Hezir\", usually written in English as Benei Hazir. The common misspelling \"Hazir\" is clearly wrong, since that means \"pig\" in Hebrew.\n\nIn the 19th century Westerners still identified the monument with the tomb of St. James the Apostle.\n\nThe tomb's inscription reveals that the cave was used by several generations of the Benei Hezir family. As well, it indicates that this was a wealthy family, able to afford a burial cave in the Kidron Valley. In the Hebrew Bible there are two mentions of men with the name of Hezir. One was the founder of the 17th priestly division (); the other one was among the leaders who set their seal to the covenant with Nehemiah (). It is not known if there is a relation between the family buried here and the biblical Hezirs.\n\nThe inscription mentions a \"nefesh\" (נפש : literally meaning \"soul\"), which is also a designation for a magnificent structure built on or alongside the tomb. It has been proposed that the Tomb of Zechariah, a solid rock-hewn object which stands by the entrance, and is thought to date from a similar period to the inscription, is actually this \"nefesh\". Another option is that the additional facade to the north of the Doric \"dystilos-in-antis\" was the original \"nefesh\". Although it did not survive it is possible to reconstruct the upper part of the above-mentioned facade as a Nabatean tower with a decorative door and window, similar monuments can be seen in Petra.\n\n"}

The agenda before the quadricentennial in 2011 included the introduction of new academic programs, improvements in the university's infrastructure, and other projects to raise UST’s national and international prominence and promote its role as a social catalyst.\n\nPlans to open satellite campuses in Santa Rosa, Laguna and General Santos City are being put in place.\n\nPhysical developments for the Sampaloc campus are ongoing. The Plaza Mayor in front the Main Building, the Quadricentennial Square which will feature the Tetraglobal sculpture, the Quadricentennial Fountain, and the Quadricentennial Alumni Walkway were constructed in 2006. To accommodate the needs of extra space for the growing number of student activities, the UST Tan Yan Kee Student Center was built in front of the Miguel de Benavides Library. The more than 80-year-old Main Building, and the artifacts and art works in the UST Museum of Arts and Sciences, were placed under the preservation of the UST Heritage Conservation program in December 2008.\n\nThe UST Benavides Cancer Institute, part of the five-year redevelopment plan and expansion of the UST Hospital for its 60-year celebration and the quadricentennial celebration, was established in 2006.\n\nPart of the university's infrastructure modernization is the construction of an P800-million, four-storey gymnasium capable of seating 5,792, designed by Thomasian architects José Pedro Recio and Carmelo T. Casas. University officials, led by Rector Rolando V. de la Rosa, O.P., led its groundbreaking ceremonies in August 2008.\n\nThe UST Publishing House in 2001 launched its quadricentennial project, “400 Books at 400!”, publishing books in a range of disciplines, from theology to literature to medicine, written in both Filipino and English.\n\nA Quadricentennial Commission was created to formulate preparations for the celebration of the UST Quadricentennial Jubilee. The commission is chaired by the UST rector, Rev. Fr. Rolando V. de la Rosa, O.P. The following are its members:\n\nThe Tongues of Fire is the official logo for the quadricentennial celebration. It features the outline of the UST Main Building Tower as a concrete symbol of the stability, integrity and 400 years of existence of the university. From the cross of the Main Building emanate four tongues of fire that spell out U, S, and T. The tongues of fire reference the future of the university and some ideals, and are reminiscent of the stripes of the Tiger, the school's mascot. The quadricentennial logo was designed by Dopy Doplon, a Thomasian.\n\n\"Ako'y Isang Tomasino\", composed by UST Faculty of Engineering alumnus Gerry de Leon, is the official theme song of the celebration. It bested four other finalists in the Q Songwriting Contest Grand Finals held the previous December at the Albertus Magnus Auditorium. It was performed by Sam Velarde, a friend of de Leon, from other university. The song was launched during the “400 days to 400 years Countdown” on December 18 at the UST football field.\n\nThe quadricentennial prayer was unveiled to the public during the “400 days to 400 years Countdown” on Dec. 18. It was recited by Fr. Pompeyo de Mesa, O.P. with a candle-lighting ceremony.\n\nThe quadricentennial flag consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, the upper one gold and the lower one white. These are defined as school colors of the university because of its Pontifical status. Embroidered with \"2011\", the flag features the sun and the colors yellow and blue, taken from the logo of the University.\n\nThe countdown clock, which is a Swatch Beatman, is produced by Swiss watch company Swatch. It is designed by former Varsitarian art director Jonathan Gamalinda.\n\nThe mascot is named \"QUSTER\", which stands for Quadricentennial University of Santo Tomas Tiger.\n\nA one-foot-by-three-feet marble marker in Plaza Intramuros near the main vehicular entrance of the campus was unveiled on February 4, 2010. It was designed by architect John Joseph T. Fernandez, Dean of the College of Architecture, and architect Froilan M. Fontecha, faculty member of the same college. It bears the name of the university, its seal on the left, and the year 1611 on the right.\n\nReplacing the old Colayco Park and its adjacent UST Cooperative Center, the Quadricentennial Square was built as a memorial of the University's four centuries of existence. It has two main features: the Quadricentennial Fountain and the Quattromondial. It is located between the Main Building and the Miguel de Benavides Library.\n\nThe Colayco Shrine, an iron statue commemorating the World War 2 victim Capt. Manuel Colayco, was nowhere to be found since its removal from the site in 2006.\n\nThis recreational and interactive fountain was unveiled in 2007. It was designed and built by Industron Inc., the same designer of Cultural Center of the Philippines and Liwasang Bonifacio fountains in Manila.\n\nThe fountain has sun-like floor patterns to pay tribute to the University’s patron saint, Thomas Aquinas. Its four cornerstones highlight UST milestones during its first four centuries.\n\nAccording to UST Facilities Management Office administrator Antonio Espejo, the fountain uses recycled water treated with chlorine. It runs three times a day (6AM to 8AM, 11AM to 1PM, and 5PM to 8PM).\n\nThere is a superstition that to counter the effect of passing through the Arch of the Centuries while studying in the University, a student must take a shower in the fountain, as this will cleanse him and prevent the happening of an event that will bar the student from graduating.\n\nThis artwork was unveiled for the Quadricentennial celebrations on January 27, 2011. This is a ten-meter-high structure of bronze and glass, made by artist Ramon Orlina, a UST alumnus.\nThe monument features four figures, which, according to Orlina, represent the school's four centuries:\n\n\nUpon the four near-naked figures, whose genitals are covered by a long strip of ribbon, rests a globe; and like the earth, it tilts 23.5 degrees. The globe represents globalization, with all its benefits and hindrances, such as environmental degradation and cultural divisions. The ribbon streams out of the globe, printed with an inscription in Latin signifying accomplishment, scholarliness and wisdom. It reads: \nReplacing the original UST Gymnasium and the old Engineering Sports Complex, the construction of the 800-million-peso UST Sports Complex began after the Vatican gave its \"blessing\" to the project. It was to be inaugurated on August 15, 2011.\n\nOfficially named the Quadricentennial Pavilion, the sports complex was designed by Thomasian architects Jose Pedro Recio and Carmelo Rosas. It stands on what used to be the Engineering Sports Complex, basketball courts, and the adjacent football field. It houses training areas for gymnastics, aerobics, taekwondo, judo, table tennis, fencing, and badminton at its ground floor. It features a ticket counter, a museum, a dance hall for the Salinggawi Dance Troupe, and a fitness room. Its main attraction is a basketball court surrounded by bleachers rising up to the fourth level.\n\nTo be built on the site of the original UST Gymnasium, the alumni center will be used as a venue for alumni gatherings, various university events, and lodging services for visitors. It is according to the pursuit of the university's Office for Alumni Relations to build a center to cater to the growing number of UST Alumni. The existing Olympic-sized swimming pool located nearby would be kept and refurbished. It was projected to be completed and opened in 2012.\n\nIts design was chosen from seven winners in a competition among students organized by the College of Architecture. Abelardo Tolentino Jr., an outstanding Thomasian alumni for Architecture, worked on the design to produce the final blueprint.\n\nUS-based Thomasian medical practitioners raised and donated USD 1 million to assist the construction of the alumni center.\n\nThe blessing of the construction site of the UST Hospital's extension building was held on 23 January 2012, the first day of the closing week of the quadricentennial celebrations. Once constructed, the services in the USTH Medical Arts building will be transferred there. The medical arts building will then be demolished to give way to another construction of a new medical arts facility.\n\nFour structures within the university's campus were declared National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum. The declaration was made on 25 January 2010. These sites were: \n\nThe Cultural Properties Preservation and Protection Act describes \"National Cultural Treasures\" as unique objects found in the Philippines that possess outstanding historical, cultural, artistic, and/or scientific value. These are considered as significant and important to the Philippines.\n\nAnother National Cultural Treasure was recently awarded to the University these are the UST Baybayin Documents which created in the years 1613 (Ducment a) and in 1625 (Document B).\n\nThe Quadricentennial countdown to 2011 coincided with UST's Christmas tradition, Paskuhan, held on December 18, 2009. The theme was called as such because the party lasted for 4 hours on December 18, which was 4 days before December 22, which was 400 days before January 28, 2011, which was the grand opening of UST's Quadricentennial celebrations. The official launch of the countdown was intended to be held on December 22, but the university was expected to be already on its Christmas vacation during that day.\n\nJanuary 28 is the feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas, the patron saint of the university, after which it was named. UST was founded on April 28, 1611.\n\nThe Paskuhan festivities and the Quadricentennial countdown were hosted by UST alumni - beauty queen Miriam Quiambao and TV personality Kim Atienza.\n\n\"Tomasino para sa Simbahan at Bayan\" (Thomasians for the Church and the Country) is a socio-civic activity that began on January 2010. The Quadricentennial's \"centerpiece project\", according to the Rector Rev. Fr. Rolando De La Rosa, O.P., aims for UST to adopt some 400 villages with the help of non-governmental organization Gawad Kalinga.\n\nThis three-day event was led by Thomasian tycoons such as Jollibee Foods Corp. president Tony Caktiong, and Mercury Drug president Vivian Que-Ascona in July 2010.\n\nIt was a three-day exposition of businesses owned and managed by Thomasian students or alumni. It was held at SMX Convention Center in the Mall of Asia Complex in Pasay City. Begun on October 15, 2010, the expo featured a job fair; shopping bazaars; wellness festival; arts, design, and construction booths; celebrity shows; food and beverage stalls; entrepreneur workshops; and advocacy seminars. Jollibee Foods Corp.’s Tony Caktiong, Mercury Drug’s Viviene Que-Ascona, and Joel Cruz of Aficionado were among the Thomasian businessmen who joined.\n\nThe expo was a joint project of UST Alumni Association, UST Office for Alumni Affairs, and the UST Thomasian Alumni Leaders Association.\n\nSome of the proceeds of this event funded the building of the Thomasian Alumni Center.\n\nUST's rare book collections and historic documents were shown to the public through an exhibition in Miguel de Benavides Library. \"Lumina Pandit\" is Latin for \"spreading the light.\" The exhibit showcased \"Doctrina Christiana\", the first book published in the Philippines, a rare copy of Copernicus' book, and academic records of UST alumni, such as those of national heroes José Rizal and Apolinario Mabini, four Philippine presidents, and six Supreme Court chief justices.\n\nThe Quadricentennial celebrations began with the Opening of the Jubilee Door and a Mass held on January 24, 2011.\n\nThe Q Parade, held simultaneously with the Icusta opening, was joined by 7,200 students and 150 registered alumni.\n\nThe parade passed from UST to Morayta and then Recto and Mendiola. There were five floats, one each representing the four centuries of the University, and the \"Q\" float.\n\nThe first float represented the first century of the university with a replica of the statue of the founder, Msgr. Miguel de Benavides, O.P. The second float showed a model of the Arch of the Centuries. The third float was designed after the Main Building which was built on the España campus in the 1920s. The fourth float was patterned after the UST Central Seminary with the Fountains of Wisdom and Knowledge. The Q float showcased models of the yet to be unveiled Quattromondial, the future Martyrs' Monument, and the Tria Haec, or the statues representing faith, hope, and love atop the Main Building.\n\nThe first four floats carried candidates for the Ideal Thomasian Personalities (TSITP) while the Q float carried reigning Thomasian personalities, Ms. Earth - Eco Tourism 2009 Angela Fernando, businessman Joel Cruz, and alumni who have won beauty pageant titles.\n\nThis annual competition was held on January 26, 2011. The university also invited other schools' dance companies to compete with each other featuring different Philippine festivals.\n\nCheermania was won by College of Commerce Cheering Squad. The Philippine Festival's Invitational Competition was won by FEU Dance Company, organized by the UST Student Organizations Coordinating Council (UST SOCC).\n\nUST being a pontifical university, Pope Benedict XVI was invited, and sent a special envoy, though he did not attend.\n\nThe pope declared a Jubilee year from January 2011 until January 2012, coinciding with the university's quadricentennial. The pope arranged to deliver a recorded video on January 28, feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas, and a thanksgiving mass was to be held.\n\nIn December 2010, the Roman Catholic Church's Apostolic Penitentiary allowed in a decree Archbishop Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales to bestow a papal blessing carrying a plenary indulgence in the Jubilee Mass held on January 24, 2011.\n\nUpon the request of Rector Magnificus Fr. Rolando dela Rosa, O.P., a separate decree also granted plenary indulgences to participants.\n\nUnveiled before the press conference held on January 21, 2011, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) issued commemorative 200-peso bills with the UST Quadricentennial logo overprinted on them. BSP released two billion pesos' worth of these 200-peso bills into general circulation as legal tender (a total of 10 million pieces). The central bank also released 400 copies of uncut two-piece 200-peso bills (amounting to PhP 400.00).\n\nBSP also issued commemorative gold and silver medals featuring the image of Msgr. Miguel de Benavides, O.P., the university's founder.\n\nNamed the Unending Grace stamps, the Philippine Postal Corp. issued four commemorative stamps with a 7-peso denomination. The designs featured were:\n\nThe PhilPost produced 100,000 pieces of these stamps, and 10,200 copies of souvenir sheets worth Php 37.00 each.\n\nThe Swiss company Swatch produced four different designer watches to commemorate the University's 400th jubilee year. The watches were named:\n\nDubbed the \"Neo-centennial Celebration\", this was a closing ceremony for the University's quadricentennial founding anniversary celebration which ran from January 23 to 27, 2012.\n"}

It is a derivative of \"assemblage\", \"collage\" and \"decollage\". The concept is similar to the basic mixed-media collage idea of building up various levels of the piece for emphasis. Known in this medium as projections, the artist tries in a variety of ways to create a visual image that causes the viewer to focus on certain areas of the art framework that would ordinarily be overlooked or relegated to the background rather than to randomly layer structure creating a whole image of the work.\n\nWhile the exact origins of VFDA are unknown, the first artwork of its nature began to appear around 2010 in the street art of various cities in Europe, including Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam. This appears to have been a response to the expanding use of computer generation in art to both design and create mixed-media collage works that could be essentially pre-designed and mass-produced. Since that time, various artists have produced series of works-known as ensembles—that are individually unique and limited in scope. Common themes of these ensembles range widely from ideological ideas like bohemianism, libertine and socially relevant matters to historical perspective, such as the interpretation of various time periods and eras.\n\nThe floor/design base of the piece is used to create a theme or story about the subject. Sections of the work are then raised to provide emphasis and act as an accent to substantiate the message. VFDA is usually created in single pieces or via limited series depending upon the artist involved and is also generally confined to canvass or wooden framework. Larger scale pieces, such as architectural interpretations, are generally not considered part of this medium. Each VFDA piece is unique is not duplicated in any way with the exception of limited prints. While some artists offer limited prints of the original artwork, the number offered is very limited in scope.\n\nThe backgrounds used in VFDA range widely from the use of true vintage pieces such as original period sheet music, fractional currency, foreign money or other items that set the time frame for the piece. Each of the items used relate the overall, theme of the art. The background can also be structured in segmented form-through the use of linear script—composed of simply drawn lines with little attempt at pictorial representation, mathematic symbolism—such as the use of angles and formulas and via free-form application—concepts chosen by the artist to represent the underlying theme in the work.\n\nVFDA is based on the unique aspect of every piece being created by the artist. Materials used to emphasize the projections include wooden palates measured to the frame, various forms of corkboard, balsa wood and other materials that are hand-cut or machined by the artist to help raise the projections to the level desired. The use of preformed shapes, three-dimensional printing and advanced computer generation of any kind used to map the work or create the projections is not considered to be part of this art form because the work can be saved, duplicated and even mass-produced.\n"}

Yaxha was the third largest city in the region and experienced its maximum power during the Early Classic period (c. AD 250–600).\n\nThe city was located on a ridge overlooking Lake Yaxha. The name of the city derives from the Mayan for \"blue-green water\"; it is a notable survival of a Classic period place-name into the modern day. The Yaxha kingdom is estimated to have covered an area of and to have had a peak population of 42,000 in the Late Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology.\n\nYaxha had a long history of occupation with the first settlement being founded sometime in the Middle Preclassic period (c. 1000–350 BC). It developed into the largest city in the eastern Petén lakes region during the Late Preclassic (c. 350 BC – AD 250) and expanded into an enormous city during the Early Classic (c. AD 250–600). At this time, in common with other sites in Petén, it shows strong influence from the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. It was eclipsed during the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) by neighbouring Naranjo but was never completely dominated. The city survived well into the Terminal Classic (c. 800–900) but was abandoned by the Postclassic period (c. 900–1525).\n\nThe ruins of the city were first reported by Teoberto Maler who visited them in 1904. The site was mapped in the 1930s and again in the 1970s and stabilisation work began in the late 1980s. The ruins include the remains of more than 500 structures with a number of major archaeological groups linked by causeways. Approximately 40 Maya stelae have been discovered at the site, about half of which feature sculpture.\n\nThe name Yaxha derives from the Mayan \"yaxa\"', which means \"blue-green water\". Yaxha is notable for the survival of its toponym from the Classic period, when it was a thriving city. David Stuart first proposed that the emblem glyph of the site should be read \"Yax-ha\" and that the name of the city (and the lake) is of ancient origin.\n\nLocated in the modern-day department of Petén, northern Guatemala, it is approximately southeast of Tikal; Yaxha is situated on the north shore of Lake Yaxha; the ruins extend roughly along a hilltop parallel to the lake shore. The ruins fall within the borders of the Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo National Park, which encompasses an area of and incorporates the remains of four ancient Maya cities: Yaxha, Topoxte, Nakum and Naranjo, as well as 10 intermediate sites and more than 280 smaller settlements.\n\nAll dates A.D.\n\nYaxha was already significant in the Late Preclassic (c. 350 BC – AD 250), and was a large site as far back as the Middle Preclassic (c. 1000–350 BC). Archaeological investigations indicate that the earliest, Middle Preclassic, settlement was in what developed into the southern and western sectors of the city. In the Late Preclassic the city became the largest settlement in the Yaxha-Sacnab basin, with a marked increase in population and in construction activity.\n\nThe city reached the height of its power during the Early Classic period of Mesoamerican chronology (c. AD 250–600), during which period the city expanded enormously. The city's Early Classic monuments are poorly preserved, meaning that the history of its period of maximum power is poorly understood. The influence of the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico is evident in Early Classic imagery following Teotihuacan's decisive intervention at Tikal in AD 378. At the end of the Early Classic, seismic activity caused movement of the Yaxha Fault, resulting in damage to buildings in the East Acropolis. The same earthquake appears to have caused damage across the city and at neighbouring Nakum. The earthquake may have resulted in the temporary abandonment of the East Acropolis.\n\nDuring this period the city established itself as an important centre on the trade routes that crossed the Petén lakes region.\n\nIn the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) the city developed with major construction projects taking place across the city centre, especially during the 8th century; the twin pyramid complex is an example of one of the major construction projects undertaken at this time. At this time the city became an important trading centre to the southeast of the great city of Tikal. During the Late Classic the city fought several wars against the neighbouring city of Naranjo, which had eclipsed Yaxha in power but was never able to complete dominate it. In 710, king K'ak' Tiliw Chan Chaak of Naranjo sacked Yaxha, captured its king and sacrificed him.\n\nIn the latter 8th century, king K'ak' Ukalaw Chan Chaak of Naranjo took a Yaxha princess as his wife; Lady Shell Star provided the king with his heir. This heir was unable to maintain peace between the cities and Itzamnaaj K'awiil of Naranjo went to war against Yaxha and its allies in AD 799, launching assaults against his mother's city in July and September of that year, some months after defeating a number of Yaxha's satellites. He managed to capture K'inich Lakamtuun, Yaxha's king.\n\nThere is no evidence of the rapid collapse of the Yaxha polity in the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) as took place at other cities in the vicinity. Instead there is evidence of renewed and widespread construction activity. It is apparent that the local elite made every effort to prolong the city's Late Classic political system. Some entry controls to the city were removed in order to encourage the flow of visitors to Yaxha from surrounding areas that were more immediately affected by the Classic Maya collapse.\n\nDuring the Postclassic (c. 900–1525) there is some evidence of activity at the site associated with the inhabited islands of Lake Yaxha but these were not in any way associated with occupation of the city itself, rather consisting of pieces of ceramic and food refuse left at the city by the islanders.\n\nTeoberto Maler first reported Yaxha's existence after visiting the ruins in 1904. The Carnegie Institution of Washington mapped the ruins in the 1930s and the site was again mapped in the early 1970s, at which time test excavations were undertaken. The Proyecto Nacional Tikal (\"National Tikal Project\") carried out a survey of architectural damage at Yaxha in 1987 and in 1988 the first work was undertaken in order to stabilise some of the structures. Archaeological excavations have continued into the 21st century; The South Acropolis was excavated from 2005 through to 2007. The early 21st century excavations of Yaxha formed a part of the Peten Sustainable Development Programme (\"Programa de Desarrollo Sostenible de Petén\") funded by the Banco Interamericano de Desarollo (Inter-American Development Bank).\n\nYaxha is the third largest ruin in Guatemala, with only Tikal and El Mirador being larger. The centre of the city consisted of a number of plazas and architectural groups, with outlying groups and the lake shore linked by causeways. The main architectural groups are the Maler Group to the north, linked to the central area by the Blom Causeway; the South (or Main) Acropolis, the West Group, the Northeast Acropolis, the East Acropolis and a number of plazas and lesser groups make up the site core. The city was linked to the shore of Lake Yaxha by the Lake Causeway. Plaza A is a twin pyramid complex. Ten main communication routes have been identified in the city, with the four principal routes having been classified as causeways by archaeologists, with the remainder classed as \"vias\". Yaxha was more densely occupied than most other Maya cities.\n\nThe site has more than 500 structures, including about 40 stelae, 13 Altars, 9 temple pyramids, 2 Mesoamerican ballcourts, and a network of \"sacbeob\" (causeways) that connect the central, northern (Maler), and eastern 'acropoleis', and the Lake causeway that was the main entrance in the past. The top of Temple 216 (restored) provides a view of the two lakes on one side and the jungle and the stepped-pyramids on the other.\n\nYaxha possesses one of very few twin pyramid complexes outside of Tikal; the fact that the site holds a twin-pyramid complex provides a visible insight into the political alliances that eventually influenced the architectural style of the city at its peak, although it appears that the complex at Yaxha was unfinished.\n\nPlaza A is a twin pyramid complex to the north of the East Acropolis. It was built during the 8th century AD.\n\nPlaza B is on the west side of the East Acropolis.\n\nPlaza C is an E-Group astronomical complex to the southeast of the site core, linked to the city centre by the Lincloln Causeway. Three Early Classic stelae were erected on the east side of the plaza.\n\nPlaza D is in the site core, at the northwest end of the Lincoln Causeway and immediately north of the South Acropolis. It is bordered to the north by the Northeast Acropolis.\n\nPlaza E is situated in the site core, on the north side of the South Acropolis and linked to it via a stairway rising from the plaza.\n\nThe East Acropolis is on the east side of the city centre, to the south of the Twin Pyramid Complex. It occupies the highest area of the city and is surrounded by Plazas A, B and C. The area that was to become occupied by the East Acropolis was first levelled from the limestone bedrock in the Middle Preclassic. In the Preclassic the East Acropolis was laid out as a triadic pyramid complex but was radically modified during the Early Classic. In its final form the East Acropolis formed a closed complex with twelve structures covering a total area of . The main buildings of the East Acropolis were Structure 216, a pyramid-temple, and Structure 218, a palace. The East Acropolis plaza featured a west-facing monumental stairway built in the Late Preclassic and remodelled in the Late Classic. The first version of the temple was built in the Late Preclassic, while the earliest version of the palace dates to the Early Classic. The East Acropolis appears to have been temporarily abandoned at the end of the Early Classic due to destruction caused by an earthquake, but was reoccupied and developed during the course of the Late Classic. During the Terminal Classic (9th century AD) great quanitites of ash and domestic ceramics were deposited in the East Acropolis. At this time a small platform was built against Structure 219, which blocked access to the southwestern terrace of the complex.\n\nThe Northeast Acropolis dates back to the Late Preclassic and incorporates an arrangement that includes a triadic pyramid forming a part of an E-Group astronomical complex.\n\nThe South Acropolis, sometimes referred to as the Main Acropolis, was built upon a high karstic hill. It had a long history, with construction starting at the end of the Middle Preclassic period and continuing through to the Terminal Classic. The acropolis is a complex consisting of six patio groups upon an artificial platform and includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt (Ballcourt 1). The patios are separated by corbel-vaulted structures that were probably elite residences; the exception is Structure 363, which is a temple between Patio 5 and Patio 6. The South Acropolis is located in the southern portion of the site core near the junction of various causeways and vias. The acropolis is bordered on the north side by the ballcourt and plazas D and E. It is bordered on the western side by Via 5 and on the southern side by Via 6. In its final form during the Terminal Classic the basal platform formed an irregular rectangle measuring east-west by north-south. The platform had stepped levels and rounded corners; the principal access appears to have been a stairway on the west half of the north side, which linked Plaza E with Patios 5 and 6 of the acropolis. Excavations of the acropolis took place in 1996 and 2006; excavators found evidence of earlier archaeological investigation that had not been recorded and suggested professional investigation in the 1970s.\n\nThe Maler Group is located to the north of the site core, linked to it by the Blom Causeway.\n\nStructure 216 is a large pyramid on the east side of Plaza A upon the East Acropolis. The remains of the temple shrine still stand upon the pyramidal base and the total height of the structure is over , making it the tallest structure at Yaxha. The earliest structure on the site was the plaza platform raised in the Late Preclassic, which consisted of a five-stepped platform with \"talud\" walls and an inset wide west-facing monumental stairway, consisting of 32 steps, each with a tread and a riser. This Late Preclassic phase stood about high. In the Early Classic a new version of the structure was built (Structure 216 sub 1). It was a stepped platform, like its predecessor, although the stairway of the new version projected westwards, possibly flanked by ballustrades. The maximum height of this construction phase was . In the 8th century AD a new version of Structure 216 was built, rising to a height of . The pyramid base had eight stepped levels with rounded corners and featured a projecting stairway. The summit shrine had three doorways and two inner chambers. Stela 41 was raised at the base of the stairway. An offering was found in the fill under the first chamber of the temple that consisted of seven eccentrics, five of them crafted from obsidian and two from flint, and a piece of mother of pearl.\n\nStructure 217 is a palace-type structure at the north end of Structure 218 in the East Acropolis. The first phase of construction dates to the Early Classic. In the 8th century the structure was redesigned. It stood upon a basal platform with slightly inclined walls. The structure had two vaulted chambers and was accessed via an east-facing stairway. In the 9th century the base of the structure was dressed with masonry.\n\nStructure 218 is a palace-type structure in the East Acropolis. The earliest version of the building dates to the Early Classic period (Structure 218 sub 1A) and had a long room with a corbel-vaulted roof. The structure had multiple east-facing doorways, possibly five, and two narrow doorways in the centre of the western facade. Traces of red pigment survive on the cornice. The location and characteristic of this Early Classic phase lead archaeologists to believe that it was built slightly after the Early Classic phase of Structure 216 (sub 1). The building was remodelled a number of times in the Early Classic. Stage 1B consisted in the division of the room into three chambers, the addition of a bench inside the north chamber and the addition of small zoomorphic masks to the sunken panels of the cornice. Phase 1C consisted of the addition of a small platform to the western facade. The Early Classic substructure has suffered subsidence at the southern end due to movement of a geological fault. Stage 2A dates to the Late Classic, during the 8th century AD. The western facade became the main facade, the height of the corbel vaulting was reduced and the previous structure was filled. Structure 218 Sub 2A measured long and was raised upon a high platform. Like the earlier version, it had a long room with a vaulted ceiling; the walls were thick and the interior vaulting was high. The building featured decorated cornices. The total heigh of the building as measured from the plaza floor may have been over . The rear, east, side of Stage 2A consisted of three plain, stepped levels. Two benches were built against the corners, possibly to disguise the subsidence that occurred as a result of the earlier earthquake. An offering was deposited underneath the central chamber; it consisted of 9 grey obsidian eccentrics, 14 flint eccentrics, a \"spondylus\" shell, a small fragment of greenstone and carbon remains mixed with unidentified vegetable fibres. The following stage, denominated 2B by archaeologists, also dates to the 8th century and consisted of the unification of Structure 218 with the neighbouring structures 217 and 219, creating a new facade with nine doorways. Three vaulted chambers were added to the east facade, with spacing between them; the north and south chambers (A and B) were built over the earlier benches. The central chamber (Chamber C) had flanking stairways. The \"talud\" wall between chambers A and C had the remains of a giant mask but the upper sectiuon of the wall was demolished by the Terminal Classic occupants of the city. The remains of painted murals were discovered in the interior of the central chamber of the palace, using red, blue, black and yellow pigments. The murals were badly damaged but apparently depicted human figures performing actions near a palace and a ballcourt. A high status Late Classic burial (Burial YX-08) was also found in Structure 218, buried in a cist in front of the main entrance. Four individuals were interred to the south of this principal burial during the Terminal Classic. They were not buried in cists and were unaccompanied by offerings. The bones belonged to individuals of varying ages and gender. At this time, during the 9th century AD, a three-chambered building with a perishable roof was built upon the upper platform of the structure; the chambers were linked by doorways. The only access to the building was via a narrow, sunken stairway built directly over the earthquake fissure. In its final form Structure 218 stood high, with four stepped platforms supporting the superstructure. The final remodelling of the building resulted in the blocking of the top of the stairway with a wall.\n\nStructure 219 is another palace-type structure at the south end of Structure 218 in the East Acropolis. The first phase of construction dates to the Early Classic. In the 8th century Structure 219 was rebuilt in a very similar manner to Structure 217, with two vaulted chambers upon a basal platform and an east-facing stairway. During the 9th century, in the Terminal Classic, the base of the structure was dressed with masonry and two small platforms were added to the southeastern portion of the building, one against the north side and the other against the southeastern corner.\n\nStructure 363 is a temple located between Patio 5 and Patio 6 of the South Acropolis. A stone monument was placed in front of the west facade of the temple; the placement of such a monument within an acropolis complex is unusual.\n\nThe Lake Causeway (\"Calzada del Lago\" in Spanish) runs north from the lake shore to the city centre, where it continues as Via 5. The total length of the causeway and the via is around . The Lake Causeway was designed to allow the rapid movement of goods and people between the city and the lake, and easy access to water. The Lake Causeway probably developed from a Middle Preclassic pathway that ran between the shore and the early settlement. The earliest version of the Lake Causeway was built in the Late Preclassic; it was about wide and was raised above natural ground level. The Via 5 continuation did not exist in the Late Preclassic, when the later city centre had not yet developed. During the Late Classic the causeway was further developed and extended with the formal construction of Via 5 running across the site core. The point where the two met was deliberately narrowed with the construction of flanking buildings and is likely to have been a guardpost where access to the site core was controlled. It is likely that travellers and goods arriving at the city were inspected and taxed at this control point. At its narrowest point the entrance from the causeway to Via 5 was just wide. Parapets were erected flanking the Lake Causeway; they stood approximately high and varied from wide. The southern extreme of the causeway was modified with the construction of a stucco-covered platform with masonry walls defining the east and south sides. From the southern end of the causeway to the union with Via 5 there is an approximate difference in altitude of more than . There is some evidence that steps were carved from the limestone bedrock where the southern platform met the Lake Causeway. During a second phase of construction in the Late Classic, the southern platform was enlarged to measure east-west by north-south. The platform was supported on the south and east sides by refurbished \"talud\" walls coated in stucco. The causeway itself was redesigned as a long ramp that joined the southern platform with the city centre and the junction with Via 5. In the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) the southern end of the Lake Causeway was re-dressed with limestone fill. The stepped sides of the southern platform were filled in and covered with stone to form ramps. At about this time Stela A, a plain monument, was erected on the platform. Also in the Terminal Classic the restrictions at the north end of the causeway where it met Via 5 were removed; the whole area was levelled with finely dressed stone and mortar that left the access free for the entire width of the causeway. Ceramic remains recovered from the Lake Causeway are scarce and poorly preserved due to the strong waterflow along the incline caused during the rain season, resulting in artefacts being eroded and washed downhill towards the lake.\n\nThe Blom Causeway (\"Calzada Blom\" in Spanish) runs north from the city centre to the Maler Group.\n\nThe Galindo Causeway (\"Calzada Galindo\" in Spanish) runs north-south between the East Acropolis (at the north end) and Plaza C (at the south end).\n\nThe Lincoln Causeway (\"Calzada Lincoln\" in Spanish) runs southeast from the city centre to Plaza C.\n\nApproximately 40 Maya stelae have been recovered at Yaxha, half of which were plain monuments without sculpted faces.\n\nStela A is a plain stela that was raised upon the platform at the southern (lake-side) end of the Lake Causeway during the Terminal Classic.\n\nStela 3 is the northernmost of the three stelae erected on the east side of Plaza C. It dates to the Early Classic period and is stylistically related to the Izapan culture of the Pacific coast. It is poorly preserved and only the lower panel survives; it bears a similarity to the equivalent panel on Stela 4.\n\nStela 4 is the central stela on the east side of Plaza C and is the best preserved of the three Early Classic monuments. It bears the sculpted image of a standing figure with left-facing feet standing upon a grotesque head. Two hieroglyphs are carved to the left of the figure's knees. One of the glyphs preserved on Stela 4 is the Emblem Glyph of Yaxha.\n\nStela 5 is the southern stela of the three on the east side of Plaza C. It is badly eroded but has been dated to AD 357, making it the earliest dated monument at the city.\n\nStela 8 is found in the Maler Group. It dates to the Early Classic and is poorly preserved with only the lower portion surviving.\n\nStela 10 is situated in the Maler Group. It is badly damaged with only the lower portion surviving. It has been dated to the Early Classic.\n\nStela 11 is a well preserved Early Classic monument on the east side of Plaza B, at the base of Structure 218 in the East Acropolis. The style of the stela is that of Teotihuacan, with the sculpted figure of a warrior with the attributes of Tlaloc, the central Mexican rain deity. The figure bears characteristic eye rings, and a butterfly ornament over the mouth, and wears a feathered headdress. The warrior carries a spear and a shield. The monument is very similar to Stela 32 from Tikal and is associated with the intervention of Teotihuacan in the Petén region during the Early Classic period.\n\nStela 13 was a sculpted monument but it has been broken into fragments, although much of the sculpture is preserved. The text on the stela includes a date in 793, the latest recorded date at the city. The stela was erected at the base of the West Pyramid of the Twin Pyramid Complex. Stela 13 bears the image of a king of Yaxha together with a text describing the celebration of an equinox.\n\nStela 30 is the northernmost of two stelae found in Plaza E. It is broken in two pieces. It dates to the Early Classic.\n\nStela 31 is located in Plaza E. It dates to the Late Classic and depicts an ornate figure with a large headdress. The monument is badly damaged and broken into several pieces.\n\nStela 36 is a badly eroded monument on the west side of Plaza B.\n\nStela 41 was raised at the base of the access stairway of Temple 216 in the 8th century AD. The monument is missing its butt, and may not be in its original location; all four sides are sculpted in an Early Classic iconographic style. The front face of the stela has two masks facing to the left and an anthropomorphic figure wearing a bracelet of a type used from the end of the Late Preclassic through to the Early Classic. The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the north and south faces of the stela are eroded but include a glyph that could be the Emblem Glyph of Yaxha.\n\nBurial YX-08 was excavated from in front of the main entrance to Structure 218, a palace-type building in the East Acropolis. The remains were deposited in a cist and possibly belonged to a member of the city's elite. The remains were those of a young adult male in his early twenties, interred lying upon his back with his skull towards the north. The skull was deformed and the upper incisors were artificially modified with jade incrustations. Two pieces of sculpted jade were found near the neck, one of them a square plaque inscribed with an anthropomorphic figure. Both of the jade pieces had traces of red pigment.\n\n"}
