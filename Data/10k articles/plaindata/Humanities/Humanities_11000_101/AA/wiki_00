The Center’s strength is based on the more than 160 MSU faculty who provide research, teaching, and service on Africa. Center faculty have research, projects, and expertise in 32 African nations.\nMSU offers instruction in up to 32 African languages and teaches 9-12 languages each year and intensive African languages in the summer. The Center is home to the national \"e-LCTL Initiative\", with a website that a) catalogs the 220+ \"Less Commonly Taught Languages\" (LCTLs) offered in the more than 120 Title VI National Resource Centers of Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, Middle East, and Canada, b) offers essays on priorities among LCTL languages for instruction in the U.S., and c) provides a database of \"web objects\" for teaching some LCTLs. See also the Center's \"Webbook of the African Languages\", a directory of description, texts, and experts for 82 important African languages.\n\nThe MSU Africana Library collection is served by two PhD Africanist librarians, more than 237,000 items, and a large annual budget. The Library hosts the \"African e-Journals Project,\" a directory of journals about Africa and full-text of 11 African journals online. It also houses the African Activist Archive, which preserves records and memories of activism in the U.S. to support the struggles of African peoples against colonialism, apartheid, and social injustice from the 1950s through the 1990s. The project holds the physical deposits at MSU of records of many activist organizations and individuals. The online African Activist Archive includes a directory of other archives and more than 7,000 historical materials, including pamphlets, documents, newsletters, leaflets, buttons, posters, T-shirts, photographs, audio and video recordings, and personal remembrances and interviews with activists.\n\nIn addition to African languages, social sciences, and arts and humanities, African Studies at MSU has been distinguished by its focus on Africa’s human needs - poverty alleviation, food security, education for development, environment and development, tropical disease, ethics of development, and gender equity. For almost two decades, MSU graduate students have produced circa. 15 Ph.D. dissertations annually on Africa, especially in history, social sciences, economics and agricultural economics, and education. The African Studies Center offers the \"Title VI Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowships\" for academic year and summer intensive study of African languages and area studies.\n\nFor more than 25 years, MSU’s African Studies Outreach Program has provided professional assistance on Africa to K-12 schools, colleges and universities, communities, state and federal government, businesses, and journalists.\n\nFor schools and colleges, the program offers \"Exploring Africa\" (online gratis materials for teaching Africa K-12) and \"South Africa: Overcoming Apartheid, Building Democracy\" (an online curricular resource). The center's African Activist Archive is an online platform aimed preserving and making available online the records of activism in the United States to support the struggles of African peoples against colonialism, apartheid, and social injustice from the 1950s through the 1990s.\n\nDatabases from the ASC provide online information on Africa:\n\nThe Center offers a weekly \"Tuesday Bulletin\" with news of African events at MSU and of African conferences, colloquia, fellowships, and grant opportunities nationwide.\n\n\n"}

It is not a true language, instead an obfuscation of English. It is a system of manipulating the syllables of spoken words to render them incomprehensible to the untrained ear. The language can be easily mentally encoded and decoded by a skilled speaker at the rate of normal speech, while those who either don't know the key or aren't practiced in rapid speech are left hearing nothing but gibberish.\n\nThe word 'Alibi' is most likely in itself a reference to the rules of the language, although not entirely correct. In this scenario the vowel/word 'I' would have been chosen, had the normal rules applied except for replacing the first 'I' with an 'A' to make the word easier to pronounce or sound better. but some children may say alibi is actually a correct language.\n\nLanguage games are primarily used by children, to disguise their speech from others. Alibi is spoken most prominently in Australia, and may be used in other English speaking countries, such as New Zealand, The United States and The United Kingdom. (In the United Kingdom it is also known as 'Uvaguv' and uses 'v' and 'g in place of 'l' and 'b'.) However the rules are simple enough so they may be applied to many other languages.\n\nAlibi strays from its parent language only in pronunciation and spelling of actual words, it retains all the same grammatical rules and protocols. The language is encoded by breaking each word into syllables and manipulating each one by elongating them. This is done by multiplying the vowel sound of each syllable three times and placing the letters 'l' and 'b' in between the first and second, and the second and third repetition respectively.\n\nFor example: The word 'hello' is broken into two syllables; 'hel' and 'lo', each vowel sound is repeated three times; 'heeel' and 'looo', the letters 'l' and 'b' are placed in between the first and second vowel and the second and third vowel respectively; 'helebel' and 'lolobo'. Thus the word 'hello' becomes 'helebel-lolobo'. there is also an alphabet but won't work if you are creating a word because alibi ( language game) also depends on syllables.\n\n"}
{"id": "337846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=337846", "title": "Athabaskan languages", "text": "Athabaskan languages\n\nAthabaskan or Athabascan (also Dene, Athapascan, Athapaskan) is a large family of indigenous languages of North America, located in western North America in three groups of contiguous languages: Northern, Pacific Coast and Southern (or Apachean). Kari and Potter 2010:10 place the total territory of the 53 Athabaskan languages at 1,563,000 mi or 4,022,000 km.\n\nChipewyan is spoken over the largest area of any North American native language, while Navajo is spoken by the largest number of people of any native language north of Mexico.\n\nAlthough the term \"Athabaskan\" is prevalent in linguistics and anthropology, there is an increasing trend among scholars to use the terms \"Dené\" and \"Dené languages\", which is how their native speakers identify it. They are applying these terms to the entire language family. For example, following a motion by attendees in 2012, the annual Athabaskan Languages Conference changed its name to the Dené Languages Conference.\n\nThe word \"Athabaskan\" is an anglicized version of a Cree language name for Lake Athabasca ( \"[where] there are reeds one after another\") in Canada. Cree is one of the Algonquian languages and therefore not itself an Athabaskan language. The name was assigned by Albert Gallatin in his 1836 (written 1826) classification of the languages of North America. He acknowledged that it was his choice to use this name for the language family and associated peoples, writing:\n\nThe four spellings—\"Athabaskan\", \"Athabascan\", \"Athapaskan\", and \"Athapascan\"—are in approximately equal use. Particular communities may prefer one spelling over another (Krauss 1987). For example, the Tanana Chiefs Conference and Alaska Native Language Center prefer the spelling \"Athabascan\". \"Ethnologue\" uses \"Athapaskan\" in naming the language family and individual languages.\n\nLinguists conventionally divide the Athabaskan family into three groups, based on geographic distribution:\n\n\nThe 32 Northern Athabaskan languages are spoken throughout the interior of Alaska and the interior of northwestern Canada in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, as well as in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Several Athabaskan languages are official languages in the Northwest Territories, including Chipewyan (\"Dënesųłıné\"), Dogrib or \"Tłı̨chǫ Yatıì\", Gwich’in (Kutchin, Loucheux), and Slavey.\n\nThe seven or more Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages are spoken in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. These include Applegate, Galice, several Rogue River area languages, Upper Coquille, Tolowa, and Upper Umpqua in Oregon; Eel River, Hupa, Mattole–Bear River, and Tolowa in northern California; and possibly Kwalhioqua-Clatskanie in Washington.\n\nThe seven Southern Athabaskan languages are isolated by considerable distance from both the Pacific Coast languages and the Northern languages. Reflecting an ancient migration of peoples, they are spoken by Native Americans in the American Southwest and the northwestern part of Mexico. This group comprises the six Southern Athabaskan languages and Navajo.\n\nAs a crude approximation, the differences between Athabaskan languages may be compared to differences between Indo-European languages. Thus, Koyukon and Dena’ina are about as different as French and Spanish, while Koyukon and Gwich’in are as different as English and Italian.\n\nThe following list gives the Athabaskan languages organized by their geographic location in various North American states and provinces (including some languages that are now extinct). Speakers of several languages, such as Navajo and Gwich’in, span the boundaries between different states and provinces. These languages are repeated by location in this list. For alternative names for the languages, see the classifications given later in this article.\n\n\n\nEyak and Athabaskan together form a genealogical linguistic grouping called \"Athabaskan–Eyak\" (AE) – well demonstrated through consistent sound correspondences, extensive shared vocabulary, and cross-linguistically unique homologies in both verb and noun morphology.\n\nTlingit is distantly related to the Athabaskan–Eyak group to form the Na-Dene family, also known as \"Athabaskan–Eyak–Tlingit\" (AET). With Jeff Leer's 2010 advances, the reconstructions of Na-Dene (or Athabascan–Eyak–Tlingit) consonants, this latter grouping is considered by Alaskan linguists to be a well-demonstrated family. Because both Tlingit and Eyak are fairly remote from the Athabaskan languages in terms of their sound systems, comparison is usually done between them and the reconstructed Proto-Athabaskan language. This resembles both Tlingit and Eyak much more than most of the daughter languages in the Athabaskan family.\n\nAlthough \"Ethnologue\" still gives the Athabaskan family as a relative of Haida in their definition of the Na-Dene family, linguists who work actively on Athabaskan languages discount this position. The Alaska Native Language Center, for example, takes the position that recent improved data on Haida have served to conclusively disprove the Haida-inclusion hypothesis. Haida has been determined to be unrelated to Athabaskan languages.\n\nA symposium in Alaska in February 2008 included papers on the Yeniseian and Na-Dené families. Edward Vajda of Western Washington University summarized ten years of research, based on verbal morphology and reconstructions of the proto-languages, indicating that these languages might be related.\n\nThe internal structure of the Athabaskan language family is complex, and its exact shape is still a hotly debated issue among experts. The conventional three-way split into Northern, Pacific Coast, and Southern is essentially based on geography and the physical distribution of Athabaskan peoples rather than sound linguistic comparisons. Despite this inadequacy, current comparative Athabaskan literature demonstrates that most Athabaskanists still use the three-way geographic grouping rather than any of the proposed linguistic groupings given below, because none of them has been widely accepted. This situation will presumably change as both documentation and analysis of the languages improves.\n\nBesides the traditional geographic grouping described previously, there are a few comparatively based subgroupings of the Athabaskan languages. Below the two most current viewpoints are presented.\n\nThe following is an outline of the classification according to Keren Rice, based on those published in Goddard (1996) and Mithun (1999). It represents what is generously called the \"Rice–Goddard–Mithun\" classification (Tuttle & Hargus 2004:73), although it is almost entirely due to Keren Rice.\n\n\nBranches 1–7 are the Northern Athabaskan (areal) grouping. Kwalhioqua–Clatskanai (#7) was normally placed inside the Pacific Coast grouping, but a recent consideration by Krauss (2005) does not find it very similar to these languages.\n\nA different classification by Jeff Leer is the following, usually called the \"Leer classification\" (Tuttle & Hargus 2004:72–74):\n\n\nNeither subgrouping has found any significant support among other Athabaskanists. Details of the Athabaskan family tree should be regarded as tentative. As Tuttle and Hargus put it, \"we do not consider the points of difference between the two models ... to be decisively settled and in fact expect them to be debated for some time to come.\" (Tuttle & Hargus 2004:74)\n\nThe Northern group is particularly problematic in its internal organization. Due to the failure of the usual criteria of shared innovation and systematic phonetic correspondences to provide well-defined subgroupings, the Athabaskan family – especially the Northern group – has been called a \"cohesive complex\" by Michael Krauss (1973, 1982). Therefore, the \"Stammbaumtheorie\" or family tree model of genetic classification may be inappropriate. The languages of the Southern branch are much more homogeneous and are the only clearly genealogical subgrouping.\n\nDebate continues as to whether the Pacific Coast languages form a valid genealogical grouping, or whether this group may instead have internal branches that are tied to different subgroups in Northern Athabaskan. The position of Kwalhioqua–Clatskanai is also debated, since it may fall in either the Pacific Coast group – if that exists – or into the Northern group. The records of Nicola are so poor – Krauss describes them as \"too few and too wretched\" (Krauss 2005) – that it is difficult to make any reliable conclusions about it. Nicola may be intermediate between Kwalhioqua–Tlatskanai and Chilcotin.\n\nSimilarly to Nicola, there is very limited documentation on Tsetsaut. Consequently, it is difficult to place it in the family with much certainty. Athabaskanists have concluded that it is a Northern Athabaskan language consistent with its geographical occurrence, and that it might have some relation to its distant neighbor Tahltan. Tsetsaut, however, shares its primary hydronymic suffix (\"river, stream\") with Sekani, Beaver, and Tsuut’ina – PA *-ɢah – rather than with that of Tahltan, Tagish, Kaska, and North and South Tutchone – PA *-tuʼ (Kari 1996; Kari, Fall, & Pete 2003:39). The ambiguity surrounding Tsetsaut is why it is placed in its own subgroup in the Rice–Goddard–Mithun classification.\n\nFor detailed lists including languages, dialects, and subdialects, see the respective articles on the three major groups: Northern Athabaskan, Pacific Coast Athabaskan, Southern Athabaskan. For the remainder of this article, the conventional three-way geographic grouping will be followed except as noted.\n\nThe Northern Athabaskan languages are the largest group in the Athabaskan family, although this group varies internally about as much as do languages in the entire family. The urheimat of the Athabaskan family is most likely in the Tanana Valley of east-central Alaska. There are many homologies between Proto-Athabaskan vocabulary and patterns reflected in archaeological sites such as Upward Sun, Swan Point and Broken Mammoth (Kari 2010). The Northern Athabaskan group also contains the most linguistically conservative languages, particularly Koyukon, Ahtna, Dena’ina, and Dakelh/Carrier (Leer 2008).\n\n\n\n\nVery little is known about Tsetsaut, and for this reason it is routinely placed in its own tentative subgroup.\n\n\n\nThe Nicola language is so poorly attested that it is impossible to determine its position within the family. It has been proposed by some to be an isolated branch of Chilcotin.\n\n\nThe Kwalhioqua–Clatskanie language is debatably part of the Pacific Coast subgroup, but has marginally more in common with the Northern Athabaskan languages than it does with the Pacific Coast languages (Leer 2005). It thus forms a notional sort of bridge between the Northern Athabaskan languages and the Pacific Coast languages, along with Nicola (Krauss 1979/2004).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reconstruction of Proto-Athabaskan phonology is still under active debate. This section attempts to summarize the less controversial parts of the Proto-Athabaskan sound system.\n\nAs with many linguists working on Native American languages, Athabaskanists tend to use an Americanist phonetic notation system rather than IPA. Although some Athabaskanists prefer IPA symbols today, the weight of tradition is particularly heavy in historical and comparative linguistics, hence the Americanist symbols are still in common use for descriptions of Proto-Athabaskan and in comparisons between members of the family. In the tables in this section, the proto-phonemes are given in their conventional Athabaskanist forms with IPA equivalents following in square brackets.\n\nSince transcription practices in Americanist phonetic notation are not formally standardized, there are different symbols in use for the same sounds, a proliferation partly due to changes in typefaces and computing technology. In the following tables, the older symbols are given first with newer symbols following. Not all linguists adopt the newer symbols at once, although there are obvious trends, such as the adoption of belted ɬ instead of barred ł, and the use of digraphs for affricates which is standard today for the laterals but not fully adopted for the dorsals. In particular, the symbols c, λ, and ƛ are rare in most publications today. The use of the combining comma above as in c̓ has also been completely abandoned in the last few decades in favor of the modifier letter apostrophe as in cʼ. Republication of older materials may preserve older symbols for accuracy, although they are no longer used, e.g. Krauss 2005, which was previously an unpublished manuscript dating from 1979.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that the symbols conventionally used to represent voiced stops and affricates are actually used in the Athabaskan literature to represent \"unaspirated\" stops and affricates in contrast to the aspirated ones. This convention is also found in all Athabaskan orthographies since true voiced stops and affricates are rare in the family, and unknown in the proto-language.\n\nThe traditional reconstruction of the Proto-Athabaskan sound system consists of 45 consonants (Cook 1981; Krauss & Golla 1981; Krauss & Leer 1981; Cook & Rice 1989), as detailed in the following table.\n\nA peculiar proto-phoneme in Proto-Athabaskan is the sound that Krauss (1976b) represents as *$, and which Leer (2005:284) has represented as *šʸ though lately he has since returned to *$ (e.g. Leer 2008). This is the phoneme found in Proto-Athabaskan, Proto-Athabaskan–Eyak, and Proto-Na-Dene that occurs in various reflexes of the first person singular pronoun. In Athabaskan languages, it usually has a reflex of /š/, the alveolar fricative, but in Eyak it appears as /x/ and in Tlingit as /χ/. Peculiarly, in Kwalhioqua-Tlatskanai, it seems to have been /x/ in at least some forms of the first-person-subject verb prefix (Krauss 1976b). It does not correspond well with other fricatives, a situation that led Krauss to considering it as unique. This proto-phoneme is not given in the table above, but is always assumed to be somehow a part of the Proto-Athabaskan inventory.\n\nA newer reconstruction by Leer (2005:284) constitutes a significant reorganization of the system. Velars are reinterpreted as palatals, labialized postalveolar affricates are reinterpreted as retroflex consonants, and other labialized consonants are removed. In addition, the clear assertion is made that stops and affricates are phonologically the same class, although they may be articulated somewhat differently. Leer also adopted the argument advanced by Keren Rice (1997) that there was no need to distinguish between *y and *žʸ. The resulting system is somewhat simpler than the traditional one, with 8 fewer phonemes.\n\nThe asymmetric lack of retroflex fricatives in the Proto-Athabaskan inventory appears as a surprising gap, but Leer argued against them being distinguished from *š and *ž: \"In my reconstruction, PA lacked distinctively reflexed *šʳ and *žʳ as opposed to plain *š and *ž\". Although Leer (2005) did not include *ʔ and *h in his list of reconstructed consonants, those two proto-phonemes nevertheless appear in a variety of reconstructions in the same article and hence it can be assumed that they are indeed part of his proto-phoneme inventory.\n\nLeer (2005:284) also offered a vowel system consisting of four long or full vowels and three short or reduced vowels which are more centralized.\n\nThe following table is adapted from Leer 2005 (p. 286) and shows the vowel correspondences between Proto-Athabaskan and the better documented Athabaskan languages.\n\nThe reconstruction of tone is an issue of major importance in Athabaskan language studies, as well as for the wider historical linguistics field. The possibility of a reconstructable tone system was first proposed by Edward Sapir, although it took around a half-century for his ideas to be realized into a coherent system. Michael Krauss's unpublished manuscript on Athabaskan tone (1979) circulated for decades before being published (2005), and has become the basis for all discussion of Athabaskan tonology. Krauss gives a detailed history of the work on Athabaskan tonology which is briefly summarized here.\n\nThe early work on Athabaskan languages ignored the existence of phonemic tone. Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice was the first linguist to describe tone for an Athabaskan language, specifically for Carrier, in 1891. Sapir’s first fieldwork on Athabaskan languages was with Chasta Costa and Kato, both Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages that lack tone. He encountered tone in Tlingit in 1914 when working with Louis Shotridge, a student and consultant of Franz Boas, with whom Sapir described the minimal pair /qáːt/ \"crippled\" and /qaːt/ \"sockeye salmon\". He then encountered tone in Tsuut’ina (Sarcee) and gradually became convinced that Proto-Athabaskan must be reconstructed as a tonal language, although he was concerned by apparently contradictory findings in Gwich’in, Deg Hit’an, and Navajo. His student Fang-Kuei Li, whom Sapir described as \"a very able Chinaman\", had the benefit of speaking Mandarin Chinese and hence being well aware of tone. Sapir and Fang-Kuei Li investigated tone in several other Athabaskan languages, including Mattole, Wailaki, Hupa, Dëne Sųłiné (Chipewyan), and Hare. The problem that disturbed Sapir and others was that tone in Athabaskan languages does correspond, but in an unexpected and difficult to explain way.\n\nIt can be seen in the table above that the languages differ in how their tones correspond: the first three have low tone where the next three have high tone, and vice versa, with the last three lacking tone entirely. This issue puzzled linguists for some time. Both Li and Harry Hoijer both harbored suspicions that Proto-Athabaskan lacked tone entirely, but it took until 1964 when Michael Krauss published a paper in the \"International Journal of American Linguistics\" where he argued that Proto-Athabaskan instead had glottalization contrasts which developed independently into tones in the daughter languages or in some cases were lost. This argument was strengthened by data from Eyak which had a system of glottal modifications on vowels that corresponded well to Athabaskan tones, and furthermore by Jeff Leer's discovery of the Tongass dialect of Tlingit, which had a system closely corresponding that of Eyak.\n\nThe oppositions in tonal distribution are explained as an ahistorical division in Athabaskan languages whereby each language becomes either \"high-marked\", \"low-marked\", or \"unmarked\" for tone based on the Proto-Athabaskan reconstruction. The following table adapted from Rice & Hargus (2005:9) shows how the syllable codas of Proto-Athabaskan (PA) and the internal reconstruction of Pre-Proto-Athabaskan (PPA) correspond with those of the high-marked and low-marked languages.\n\nIn the above table, the symbol v represents a monomoraic reduced vowel, the VV represents a bimoraic full vowel, and the V a monomoraic full vowel in a syllable nucleus whose second mora is ’. The R represents a sonorant, the S a fricative, the T a stop or affricate, and the ’ a glottalization of the preceding segment. Note that nearly all languages that developed tone have also lost syllable-final ejectivity, retaining only the glottalized sonorants and bare glottal stops in that position. (Syllable initial ejective stops and affricates are of course retained.)\n\nBecause obvious similarities in morphology are prevalent throughout all of the languages in the Athabaskan family, Proto-Athabaskan rejoices in an extensive reconstructed proto-morphology. All Athabaskan languages are morphologically complex and are commonly described as polysynthetic, thus it comes as no surprise that the proto-language is also morphologically complex.\n\nKeren Rice (2000) offers a \"Pan-Athabaskan\" verb template that characterizes the complexity of verb morphology in the proto-language and the daughter languages.\n\nThe actual verb template of Proto-Athabaskan has not been reconstructed yet, as noted by Vajda (2010:38). Nonetheless, Rice's generalization of the verb template based on various languages in the family is a reasonable approximation of what the structure of the Proto-Athabaskan verb might look like.\n\nRice's is probably the newest attempt at a Pan-Athabaskan template, but it is not the only one. Kibrik (1995) and Hoijer (1971) also proposed templates which generalized across a number of Athabaskan languages. Hoijer's proposal is missing several elements which were described in detail later, but Kibrik's is not terribly different from Rice's.\n\nKibrik only gives the zones rather than individual positions where the distinction matters. In addition, Kibrik did not give the domains and boundaries which have been added here for comparison.\n\nA major distinction between the Kibrik and Rice versions is in the terminology, with Kibrik's \"Standard Average Athabaskan\" maintaining much of the traditional Athabaskanist terminology – still widely used – but Rice changing in favor of aspectual descriptions found in wider semantic and typological literature. The terminology in comparison:\n\n\nKari (1989) offers a rigorous foundation for the position class system that makes up the verb template in Athabaskan languages. He defines a few terms and resurrects others which have since become standard in Athabaskanist literature.\n\n\nKari (1989) and elsewhere uses + to indicate morpheme boundaries. This convention has been adopted by some Athabaskanists, but many others use the more common – instead. Another innovation from Kari is the use of angle brackets to mark epenthetic segments, a convention which is not often used even by Kari himself.\n\nThe \"classifier\" is a verb prefix that occurs in all Athabaskan languages as well as the Tlingit and Eyak languages. It is, as Leer (1990:77) puts it, \"the hallmark of Na-Dene languages\". The classifier is found in no other language family, although may be present in the Yeniseian family per Vajda (2010). It is an obligatory prefix such that verbs do not exist without the classifier. Its function varies little from language to language, essentially serving as an indicator of (middle) voice and valence for the verb.\n\nThe name \"classifier\" is confusing to non-Athabaskanists since it implies a classificatory function that is not obvious. Franz Boas first described it for Tlingit, saying \"it is fairly clear that the primary function of these elements is a classificatory one\" (Boas 1917:28), a not inaccurate statement given that it does enter into the classificatory verb system. Previously Edward Sapir had noted it in his seminal essay on the Na-Dene family, calling it a \"'third modal element'\" (Sapir 1915:540). He described it as indicating \"such notions as transitive, intransitive, and passive\" (id.), thus having voice and valency related functions. Once it was realized that the Tlingit and Athabaskan morphemes were functionally similar Boas's name for the Tlingit form was extended to the Athabaskan family. Unfortunately the classifier has only the vague remains of classificatory function in most Athabaskan languages, so in this family the name is opaque.\n\nBecause of the confusion that occurs from the use of the term \"classifier\", there have been a number of proposals for replacement terms. Andrej Kibrik (1993, 1996, 2001) has used the term \"transitivity indicator\" with the gloss abbreviation , Keren Rice (2000, 2009) has used \"voice/valence prefix\" abbreviated , and for Tlingit Constance Naish and Gillian Story (1973:368–378) used \"extensor\". None of these alternatives has gained acceptance in the Athabaskan community, and Jeff Leer describes this situation:\n\nJeff Leer (1990:93) offers an early reconstruction of the Proto-Athabaskan classifier. It is a portmanteau morpheme with two dimensions that are both phonological and functional. The one dimension is the \"series\", which surfaces as the presence or absence of a lateral fricative. The other dimension is the \"D-effect\", surfacing as the presence or absence of either vocalization or an alveolar stop.\n\nLeer (2008:22) gives a newer, more complex reconstruction, which takes into account some rare correspondences with the Eyak \"yi-\" prefix. This Eyak form corresponds to a Proto-Athabaskan \"*nʸə-\" that is mostly lost.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5283931", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5283931", "title": "Bauakademie", "text": "Bauakademie\n\nThe Bauakademie (\"Building Academy\") in Berlin, Germany, was a higher education school for art of building to train master builders. It originated from the construction department of the Academy of Fine Arts and Mechanical Sciences (from 1704), which emphasized the aesthetic elements of art of building while ignoring the technical. Thus, the governmental Upper Building Department (\"UBD\") decided to establish an entirely new building educational institution named \"Bauakademie\". It was founded on 18 March 1799 by King Frederick William III and, in 1801, incorporated into the UBD, as its section. \n\nThe building of the \"Building Academy\" (\"Bauakademie\") built between 1832 and 1836 (later known as Schinkel's Bauakademie), is considered one of the forerunners of modern architecture due to its theretofore uncommon use of red brick and the relatively streamlined facade of the building. Designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, it was built near the Berlin City Palace and accommodated two royal Prussian institutions: the State Construction Commission (\"Oberbaudeputation\"), which Schinkel was director of, and - first of all - the \"Building Academy\" (institution), which in 1879 gave birth to the \"Royal Technical Higher School\" (\"Königlich Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg\") - the forerunner of the Technical University of Berlin. \n\nFor nearly 50 years (1885-1933), the Bauakademie became the home of the „Königlich Preussische Messbild-Anstalt“ renamed to „Staatliche Bildstelle“ in 1921. This institution, under its director Albrecht Meydenbauer, became the first world-wide office professionally working with photogrammetry and establishing an archive of historical buildings based on photography. By 1920, approximately 20.000 glass-negatives of the format 30x30 cm and 40x40 cm had been collected in Germany and abroad.\n\nDuring the Weimar period, the Bauakademie was the home of the famous Deutsche Hochschule für Politik as well as other institutions supported by the State of Prussia.\n\nDamaged during World War II, the Bauakademie was then partially restored, but in 1962 the building was demolished to make room for the future Ministry of Foreign Affairs of East Germany.\n\nIn 1995, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of East Germany was demolished in order to recreate the Werderscher Markt area. Since then, proposals to rebuild Schinkel's Bauakademie have been discussed with city and Federal authorities. The Werderscher Markt area has already been partially recreated by the Bertelsmann-funded reconstruction of the Alte Kommandantur. As for the Bauakademie, between 2000 and 2001 students erected a temporary structure to give an impression of the volume and form of the building. Current proposals under consideration intend to use a reconstructed Bauakademie to accommodate an architecture museum as well as a Mercedes-Benz research institute about the future of automobile.\n\nThe cost of the project is estimated at 51 million euros.\n\n"}

Chasteen covers the history of Latin America from 1492 to the present with an integrative approach that follows a chronological framework. The book is divided into chapters that address themes that were common throughout Latin America, such as colonialism, independence, progress, neocolonialism, nationalism, and revolution. Other themes that frequently come up in the book include issues of race, ethnicity, and class as well as the formation of republics. A timeline is provided at the beginning of the book; and various maps, photographs, and images are used throughout the book. \"Born in Blood and Fire\" was originally published by W. W. Norton and Company in 2001. Three other editions have been published since, the most recent in 2016. Later editions include updates and expansion of colonialism, nationalism, the Cuban Revolution, and current political and economic issues. W. W. Norton and Company published Chasteen’s companion reader entitled \"Born in Blood and Fire: Latin American Voices\" in 2011. This book includes narratives from a variety of sources that illustrate life in Latin America during the last six centuries. Many of these excerpts from books, essays, and newspaper articles were translated by Chasteen. Other books by the author include \"Americanos: Latin America’s Struggle for Independence\", \"Heroes on Horseback: A Life and Times of the Last Gaucho Caudillos\", and \"National Rhythms, African Roots: The Deep History of Latin American Popular Dance\".

VARA was passed in 1990 and added several moral rights for artists in the U.S., including the right of authors to prevent mutilation of their works.\n\nThe Plaintiffs John Carter, John Swing, and John Veronis (artists) created art and sculpture work together in New York City under the name \"Jx3\". 474431 Associates was the owner of a former Macy's warehouse at 47-44 31st Street, in the Long Island City section of Queens, New York. 474431 Associates leased this building to 47-44 31st Street Associates, L.P. and from February 1, 1990 to June, 1993, SIG Management Company [\"SIG\"] managed the property as \"The Factory Building\" and marketed it as a mall.\n\nOn December 16, 1991, the artists entered into a contract with SIG \"to design, create and install sculpture and other permanent installations\" in the building. The artists had \"full authority in design, color, and style\" of the artwork they installed. The artists created multiple ecological themed sculptures along with a mosaic on the floor made of recycled light bulbs. SIG could direct the location and installation of the artwork within the building. SIG agreed to pay the artists one thousand dollars a week for at least forty hours of work. The artists retained copyright in their work, but SIG was to receive 50% of all proceeds from the exploitation of the art.\n\nOn March 31, 1994, Helmsley-Spear, Inc. assumed the management of the property. Helmsley-Spear's representatives forbade the artists from installing any further artwork, and stated that they were going to remove the completed art from the building. The artists believed that this was a mutilation of their artwork under Visual Artists Rights Act and filed a lawsuit to enjoin the defendants from taking such actions.\n\nThe District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Second District, granted the artists an injunction under VARA prohibiting removal of the work. That decision was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Second Circuit found that the sculpture was a work made for hire and vacated the injunction. In coming to this conclusion, it applied the 13-factor test from \"Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid\", 490 U.S. 730, for determining if a work is created as a \"work made for hire\" or if the artist was working as \"independent contractor\".\n\n"}

{"id": "1863170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1863170", "title": "Clitic doubling", "text": "Clitic doubling\n\nIn linguistics, clitic doubling, or pronominal reduplication is a phenomenon by which clitic pronouns appear in verb phrases together with the full noun phrases that they refer to (as opposed to the cases where such pronouns and full noun phrases are in complementary distribution).\n\nClitic doubling is found in many languages, including Albanian, Aromanian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Degema, Greek, Persian, Romanian, Somali, Italian, and Spanish.\n\nThe conditions on clitic doubling vary from language to language, generally depending on well-known properties of the objects along the animacy hierarchy (allowing, requiring, or forbidding clitic-doubling for different kinds of objects). In this regard, clitic doubling for objects can be viewed as a species of differential object marking.\n\nSpanish is one well-known example of a clitic-doubling language, having clitic doubling for both direct and indirect objects. Because standard Spanish grammatical structure does not draw a clear distinction between an indirect object and a direct object referring to a person or another animate entity (see Spanish prepositions), it is common but not compulsory to use clitic doubling to clarify. Compare:\n\nIn such constructions, the indirect object can be expressed both as a full noun phrase and as a clitic in order to note that the noun phrase beginning with \"a\" (to) should be understood as an indirect object:\n\nThe above, if literally translated into English, would be redundant:\n\nThis usage is highly preferred for many verbs, but for some verbs it is not compulsory, and it would also be valid to say: \"Siempre ofrezco café a mis invitados\", without clitic doubling.\n\nSimilarly, the direct object may also be doubled, with both the direct object pronoun and the full noun phrase, but this is not as common as indirect clitic doubling and is usually influenced by definiteness, animacy, and specificity.\n\nOne particular use is to clarify emphatic structures:\n\nIn Italian, clitic doubling is used as colloquial pleonasm, although it is considered incorrect by some.\n\nExample: \"a me mi pare di sì\" (\"I [personally, for what I am concerned] think so\")\n\nIn Iloko, a third person pronoun must co-occur with the full noun phrase to which it refers when 1) the noun phrase is the agent of a transitive verb and a pronoun is the patient, or when 2) the noun phrase is the possessor and a pronoun is the thing possessed. The appropriate fused personal pronoun is used and the number of its third person component must agree with the noun phrase.\n\nExamples:\n\n\"NOT:\" *Nakitaak ni Maria.\n\n\"NOT:\" *Nakitaak da Maria ken ni Juan.\n\n\"NOT:\" *Anakka dagiti Rizal.\n\nIn Lombard, clitics are widely used with both nouns and pronouns.\n\nTe gh'el diset ti a la Rina che l'è staa luu?\nWill you tell OR Would you mind telling Rina it was him [who did it]?\n\nIn Venetian, clitics usually double the second singular person subject and third singular and plural subject.\n\nThe above, if literally translated into English, would be redundant:\n'My parents come tomorrow'\n'Marco comes tomorrow'\n'You come tomorrow'\n\nInterrogative subjects clitics double also other subjects. They attach to the verb:\n'Do you (pl.) sing as well?'\n\nAccusative clitics double first and second singular/plural direct object\nIn some varieties of the language, also dative clitics may double and indirect object, even of third person:\nIn the standard Macedonian language, clitic doubling is obligatory with definite direct and indirect objects, which contrasts with standard Bulgarian where clitic doubling is optional. Non-standard dialects of Macedonian and Bulgarian have differing rules regarding clitic doubling.\n\nClitic doubling occurs in Degema, as it does in Romance and Slavic languages. However, clitic doubling in Degema is not associated with the presence of a preposition as in Romance languages like Spanish nor is it associated with topicality or specificity as in Slavic languages like Bulgarian. Rather, what make clitic doubling in Degema possible are syntactic (movement and anaphoricity) and discourse (emphasis and/or familiarity) factors (Kari 2003) Consider (1) below:\n\n(1) Eni mo=sire\n\nIn (1) the subject noun phrase (NP) 'Eni' is doubled by the clitic 'mo='. The clitic agrees in person, number and case with the doubled subject NP.\n\nExample (2) shows that specific and non-specific subjects in Degema can be doubled by a clitic:\n\nExample (3) shows that both topicalized and non-topicalized NPs in Degema can be doubled by a clitic:\n\nIn Degema, the preposition does not feature in clitic doubling constructions in particular and in cliticization in general. Although there are object NPs such as indirect object NPs that can cooccur with a preposition, there are no corresponding object clitics to double them, unlike subject NPs.\n\nKari (2003: 135f) adds that \"syntactic factors are stronger than discourse factors in the licensing of clitic doubling in Degema. Discourse factors only ensure the expression or suppression of the doubled NP after syntactic operations have taken place\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "51578025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51578025", "title": "Critical data studies", "text": "Critical data studies\n\nCritical data studies is the systematic study of data and its criticisms. The field was named by scholars Craig Dalton and Jim Thatcher. Prior to its naming, significant interest in critical data studies was generated by danah boyd and Kate Crawford, who posed a set of research questions for the critical study of big data and its impacts on society and culture. As its name implies, critical data studies draws heavily on the influence of critical theory which it applies to the study of data. Subsequently, others have worked to further solidify a field called critical data studies. Some of the other key scholars in this discipline include Rob Kitchin and Tracey P. Lauriault. Scholars have attempted to make sense of data through different theoretical frameworks, some of which include analyzing data technically, ethically, politically/economically, temporally/spatially, and philosophically. Some of the key academic journals related to critical data studies include the \"Journal of Big Data\" and \"Big Data and Society\".\n\nIn their article in which they coin the term 'critical data studies,' Dalton and Thatcher also provide several justifications as to why data studies is a discipline worthy of a critical approach. Firstly, 'big data' is an important aspect of twenty-first century society, and the analysis of 'big data' allows for a deeper understanding of what is happening and for what reasons. Furthermore, big data as a technological tool and the information that it yields are not neutral, according to Dalton and Thatcher, making it worthy of critical analysis in order to identify and address its biases. Building off this idea, another justification for a critical approach is that the relationship between big data and society is an important one, and therefore worthy of study. Dalton and Thatcher stress how the relationship is not an example of technological determinism, but rather how big data can shape the lives of individuals. Big data technology can cause significant changes in society's structure and in the everyday lives of people, and being a product of society, big data technology is worthy of sociological investigation. Moreover, data sets are almost never completely raw, that is to say without any influences. Rather, data are shaped by the vision or goals of a research team, and during the data collection process, certain things are quantified, stored, sorted and even discarded by the research team. A critical approach is thus necessary in order to understand and reveal the intent behind the information being presented. Moreover, data alone cannot speak for itself; in order to possess any concrete meaning, data must be accompanied by theoretical insight or alternative quantitative or qualitative research measures. Dalton and Thatcher argue that if one were to only think of data in terms of its exploitative power, there is no possibility of using data for revolutionary, liberatory purposes. Finally, Dalton and Thatcher propose that a critical approach in studying data allows for 'big data' to be combined with older, 'small data,' and thus create more thorough research, opening up more opportunities, questions and topics to be explored.\n\nThe use of data in modern society brings about new ways of understanding and measuring the world, but also brings with it certain concerns or issues. Data scholars attempt to bring some of these issues to light in their quest to be critical of data. Rob Kitchin identifies both technical and organizational issues of data, as well as some normative and ethical questions. Technical and organization issues concerning data range from the scope of datasets, access to the data, the quality of the data, the integration of the data, the application of analytics and ecological fallacies, as well as the skills and organizational capabilities of the research team. Some of the normative and ethical concerns addressed by Kitchin include surveillance through one's data (dataveillance), the privacy of one's data, the ownership of one's data, the security of one's data, anticipatory or corporate governance, and profiling individuals by their data. All of these concerns must be taken into account by scholars of data in their objective to be critical.\n\nFollowing in the tradition of critical urban studies, other scholars have raised similar concerns around data and digital information technologies in the urban context. For example, Joe Shaw and Mark Graham have examined these in light of Henri Lefebvre's 'right to the city'.\n\n"}

It was given to the nascent Capitoline Museums by Pope Benedict XIV in 1749, shortly after its discovery. Its graceful balance and sentimental appearance made it a favourite among the neoclassical generations of artists and visitors, and it was copied in many materials from bronze to biscuit porcelain. Antonio Canova consciously set out to outdo the Antique original with his own \"Cupid and Psyche\" of 1808 (\"illustration, below left\")\n\nThe sculpture was discovered in the garden of the \"vigna\" of the canonico Panicale on the Aventine Hill in February 1749.\n\nThe sculpture quite eclipsed a Roman marble of a winged Cupid and Psyche that had been discovered in the 17th century and removed to the Medici collection in Florence. The Capitoline \"Cupid and Psyche\" was among the cream of the Roman collections sequestered by the French under the terms of the treaty of Tolentino (1797) and transferred to Paris amid grand theatrics. It was returned to Rome after the fall of Napoleon. \n\nNot all viewers were satisfied by its mediocre execution, and Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny noted that Jean-Baptiste de Saint-Victor thought it was a reflection of some earlier, better work, and that, earlier, Joseph-Jerome Le Français de Lalande hoped in print that it might inspire some modern sculptor to come up with a superior work on the same subject. Antonio Canova took up the challenge quite consciously, in his \"Cupid and Psyche\" of 1808.\nAnother version of the \"Cupid and Psyche\" was discovered by conte Giuseppe Fede in his early excavations at Hadrian's Villa, Tivoli. It has disappeared now, but it was drawn, in its completed and restored condition, by Pompeo Batoni, who was assembling a \"paper museum\" of antiquities in 1727-30 for the English antiquary Richard Topham. As it was restored, Cupid turns his head away coyly.\n"}

It has people from a wide variety of ethnic, racial, national, and religious backgrounds.\n\nCalifornia is the most populated sub-national entity in North America. If it were an independent country, California would rank 34th in population in the world. It has a larger population than either Canada or Australia. Its population is one third larger than that of the next largest state, Texas. California surpassed New York to become the most populous state in 1962. However, according to the \"Los Angeles Times\", California's population growth has slowed dramatically in the 21st century. In 2010, the state's five most populous counties were Los Angeles County, San Diego County, Orange County, Riverside County, and San Bernardino County, with Riverside County having the largest percentage increase in population. The largest metro areas in California, as of 2010, are Los Angeles, San Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, San Diego, Riverside-San Bernardino, and Sacramento. From 2006 until 2016, the state lost a net population of about 1 million people from domestic immigration; the plurality of whom moved to Texas, yet the population of the state continued to grow due to migration from overseas.\n\nAs of 2006, California had an estimated population of 37,172,015, more than 12 percent of the U.S. population. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 1,557,112 people ( i.e. 2,781,539 births minus 1,224,427 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 751,419 people. Immigration resulted in a net increase of 1,415,879 people, and migration from within the U.S. resulted in a net decrease of 564,100 people. California is the 13th fastest-growing state. As of 2008, the total fertility rate was 2.15. The most recent census reports the population of California as 39,144,818.\n\nThe center of population of California is located at in Kern County, near the town of Shafter.\n\nNo single ethnic group forms a majority of California's population, making the state a minority-majority state. Hispanics (of any race) are the largest single ethnic group in the state. Spanish is the state's second most widely spoken language. Areas with especially large Spanish speaking populations include the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the California-Mexico border counties of San Diego and Imperial, and the San Joaquin Valley. Nearly 43% of Californian residents speak a language other than English at home, a proportion far higher than any other state.\n\nCalifornia is home to almost 25% of the country's undocumented population, making up 6% of California's residents overall. Two-thirds of California's undocumented population have lived in the state for more than 10 years.\n\nAbout 26% of California's public school students in the 2011–12 school year identified themselves as white (non-Hispanic), and 52% of the state's students identified themselves as Hispanic or Latino. The following ethnic groups that made up the statewide public school student body were Asians (11%), African Americans (7%), Native Americans (0.7%), and Pacific Islanders (0.6%). Students of mixed race made up about 2% of the public schools. Hispanics made up the majority of the state's public schools since 2010. Los Angeles Unified School District, the largest school district in California and second largest in the nation, is 73% Hispanic, 10% African American, 9% non-Hispanic Caucasian, 6% Asian, 0.5% Native American, and 0.4% Pacific Islander.\n\nIn 2011, there was an estimated 2.6 million undocumented immigrants residing in California.\n\nAccording to 2015 US Census Bureau estimates, California's population was 72.9% White, 6.5% Black or African American, 14.7% Asian, 1.7% Native Americans, 0.5% Pacific Islander and 3.8% from two or more races. By ethnicity, 38.8% of the total population is Hispanic-Latino (of any race) and 61.4% Non-Hispanic (of any race). Hispanics are the largest ethnic group in California.\n\nIn 2015, California had the largest minority population in the United States. Non-Hispanic whites decreased from about 76.3 - 78% of the state's population in 1970 to 38.0% in 2015. While the population of minorities accounts for 100.7 million of 300 million U.S. residents, 20% of the national total live in California.\n\nCalifornia has the highest number, and second highest percentage, of Asian Americans by state. Only Hawaii has a higher Asian American percentage than California. While New Mexico and Texas have higher percentages of Hispanics, California has the highest total number of Hispanics of any U.S. state. Hispanics are the largest single ethnic group in the state.\n\nThe largest named ancestries in California are Mexican (25%), German (9%), Irish (7.7%), English (7.4%) and Italian (5.8%); there are 65 other ethnicities with sizable populations in California including Albanians, Australians, Canadians, Haitians, and Somalis as examples. Both Los Angeles and San Francisco have large numbers of residents with English, French, Italian, German, Russian and Scandinavian ancestry.\n\nCalifornia has the largest population of White Americans in the U.S., totaling 21,453,934 residents as of the 2010 census. The state has the fifth largest population of African Americans in the U.S., an estimated 2,299,072 residents. California's Asian population is estimated at 4.9 million, approximately one-third of the nation's estimated 15 million Asian Americans. California's Native American population of 285,512 is the third-largest of any state, behind Arizona and Oklahoma. Other estimates place the Native American population of California at one million. \nSince the 2000 U.S. Census, California has been known as the second state in US history (after Hawaii since its statehood in 1959) to have a non-white majority, and since 2014, the first state to have a Latino plurality surpass other racial/ethnic groups. The media discussed the possibility of Latinos becoming a majority in the 21st century, for the first time since statehood (1850) when massive immigration of Anglo-Americans during the California Gold Rush of 1848-49 reduced Spanish speakers to 20 percent of the population. \n\nCalifornia has the largest population of European Americans of any state. For example, in 2000 California had more Bulgarian Americans, Romanian Americans and Hungarian Americans than any other U.S. state. Los Angeles and San Francisco have large Russian American or Russian populations, as well Ukrainian Americans; and a long history of English, Irish, Italian, German, and Polish communities established by immigrants in the late 19th century. There are also many English Americans, Irish Americans, and French Americans whose ancestors were the original 49ers, also known as the California Gold Rush immigrants. There are also immigrant communities from the former Yugoslavia such as Bosnians, Croatians, and Serbians.\n\nCalifornia has over one million residents each with Spanish or Portuguese ancestry , with communities along coastal parts of the state such as San Diego, Long Beach, Camarillo, Santa Clara Valley (including Cupertino, Gilroy and San Jose), Salinas Valley, Santa Maria Valley, and San Joaquin Valley. A small wave of Danish, Dutch and Swedish immigrants founded towns like Lathrop near Stockton, Artesia near Los Angeles, Kingsburg south of Fresno, Solvang north of Santa Barbara in the late 1800s and the private community of Sveadal located 15 miles south of San Jose and populated entirely by members of the Swedish American Patriotic League. Small colonies of early 19th century Russian settlement under the Russian American Company are in Fort Ross, Calistoga and the Russian River Valley in Sonoma and Napa counties. Small Amish/Mennonite colonies exist in an area bordered by the towns Oakdale, Riverbank and Ripon near Modesto and in Reedley, Sanger and Orange Cove near Fresno in the San Joaquin Valley; and in the outer Salinas Valley.\n\nThe state also has over 2000 Circassian Americans with a little community in Anaheim.\n\nLatinos, mainly Mexican Americans, form major portions of the population of Southern California, especially in Los Angeles, as well as the San Joaquin Valley. The city of Los Angeles is often said to be the largest Mexican community in the United States. Census records kept track of the growth since 1850, but Mexicans and Mexican-Americans have lived in California since Spanish Colonial times. However, the number and percentage population of Latinos living in California increased rapidly in the late 20th century. The result is that, today, Latinos are the largest ethnic group in Los Angeles County, at over 40 percent of the county's population. Latinos are predominantly concentrated in the older eastern and southern suburbs surrounding downtown Los Angeles and northern Long Beach, the southern/eastern San Fernando Valley, and the San Gabriel/Pomona Valleys. They also comprise sizable communities in Arvin, Bakersfield, Delano, El Monte, Fontana, Fresno, Indio, La Puente, Ontario, Oxnard, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San José, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Stockton, Vallejo and Yuba City. In Santa Ana in Orange County, Latinos comprise 75 percent of the population. Nearby Anaheim is over half Latino, and Orange County's population is 30-35 percent Latino.\n\nThe Imperial Valley on the U.S.-Mexican border is about 70–75% Latino; communities with many Latinos can also be found in Riverside County, especially at its eastern end, and the Coachella Valley. The Central Valley has many Mexican American migrant farm workers. Latinos are the majority in 14 counties: Colusa, Fresno, Glenn, Imperial, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced, Monterey, Napa, San Benito, Santa Cruz, Tulare and Yolo counties.\n\nLatinos make up at least 20% of the San Francisco Bay Area. Many live in San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties, as well in San Francisco. The Napa Valley and Salinas Valley have predominantly Latino communities established by migrant farm workers. San Jose is about 30-35 percent Latino, the largest Latino community in northern California, while the Mission District, San Francisco and Lower/West Oakland has barrios established by Mexican and Latin American immigrants. The Mexican American communities of East Los Angeles and Logan Heights, San Diego, as well the San Joaquin Valley are centers of historic Chicano and Latino cultures.\n\nCalifornia also has the largest populations of Hispanics/Latinos in the country. Most of the state's Latinos have Mexican ancestry, having the largest Mexican population in the United States, making up about 31 percent of the state population. California has a large and diverse population, having the largest Central American, especially Salvadorans population in the United States. Guatemalan Americans are spread out in Southern California after previously centered in Los Angeles between 1970 and 2010. California also has many Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans, Honduran Americans, and Nicaraguan Americans, along with people of Brazilian, Chilean, Colombian, Peruvian and other South American ancestry. Los Angeles has had the United States' largest Central American community, as well as the largest Mexican American community, since the 1910s. In fact, the 1900 census record finds 319 to 619 out of 100,000 residents in the city of Los Angeles were \"Spanish\" or \"Mexican\". (see Demographics of Los Angeles). Nearly 31 percent of Los Angeles itself is of Mexican descent, having the largest Mexican population of any city in the United States.\n\nIn Mariposa County, there is a very small community of Californios or Spanish American people as they identify themselves, that dates back before the U.S. annexation of California. Hornitos is home to an estimated 1,000 people and many are \"Californios\". The community's \"Spanish\" Californio culture is closely linked with Mexico and other Latin American nations. Spanish colonial/Mexican/Latino influences was always a major part of California after it became part of the U.S. since 1848 and its statehood in 1850. \n\nThe state has a long history of established Asian American communities, including Chinese since the 1850s, Japanese since the 1880s, and Filipinos for over a century. A large wave of Asian immigration since 1965 brought in more Chinese along with Koreans and Southeast Asians after the Vietnam war ended in the late 1970s. South Asians are also a fast-growing group.\n\nAs of the 2010 Census there were a total of 17,941,286 respondents who claimed to be Asian American and Asian. Out of these respondents in the United States, 30.9% live in California, with 5,556,592 Asian Americans being counted by the 2010 Census. This is a 1.5 million growth in population from the 2000 census, making Asian Americans 14.9 percent of the state's population. Out of those almost 5.6 million Asian Americans in California there are 1,474,707 Filipinos, 1,349,111 Chinese, 647,589 Vietnamese, 590,445 Indians, 505,225 Koreans, 428,140 Japanese, 109,928 Taiwanese, 102,317 Cambodians, 91,224 Hmong, 69,303 Laotians, 67,707 Thais, 53,474 Pakistanis, 39,506 Borneons, Sumatrans, and Indonesians, 17,978 Burmese, 11,929 Sri Lankans, 10,494 Bangladeshis, 6,231 Nepalese, 5,595 Malaysians, 4,993 Mongolians, 1,513 Singaporeans, 1,377 Okinawans, and 750 Bhutanese.\n\nFilipino Americans are particularly numerous in Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Diego, San Mateo and Solano counties, and in southern California communities such as Artesia, Baldwin Park, Carson, Cerritos, Covina, West Covina, and the Eagle Rock district of Los Angeles. Around San Diego, many Filipinos live in the communities of Mira Mesa, National City, and Chula Vista. Delano near Bakersfield, other towns in the San Joaquin Valley, the Inland Empire of Riverside-San Bernardino, Coachella Valley-Imperial Valley region, Salinas, Stockton and Lathrop, and the Santa Maria/San Luis Obispo area also have large Filipino American populations. Daly City south of San Francisco has a large Filipino population and is the largest percentage wise in the United States. As of the 1980s, Filipinos have been the largest population of Asians in California. Twenty percent of registered nurses, in 2013, in California are Filipino.\n\nChinese Americans are numerous in San Francisco, Oakland, the East Bay, South Bay, the Central Coast of California, Sacramento, San Diego, and the San Gabriel Valley region of Los Angeles County. The San Francisco Bay Area has a greater concentration of Cantonese-speaking Chinese than any other region in the United States. The Mexican border community of Calexico, California in addition to Mexicali has large numbers of Chinese Mexican Americans, that is, Mexican Americans of Chinese ancestry. Smaller Chinese communities can also be found in San Jacinto Valley, Lake Elsinore, and Victorville.\n\nSouthern California has perhaps the largest Taiwan-born Chinese American community in the U.S., particularly in the San Gabriel Valley (i.e. Walnut and Diamond Bar), Buena Park, Cerritos, West Covina, Irvine, communities in the South Bay, Los Angeles and southern Orange County. Many minority groups from China also live in California, for example, there are Tibetan, Mongolian and Uyghur Americans concentrated in San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Orange County, and the Los Angeles/Long Beach area.\n\nLarge Korean American communities exist in the Koreatown area of Los Angeles, the eastern San Gabriel Valley, the San Fernando Valley, Cerritos/Long Beach, South Bay, Los Angeles, northern Orange County and San Diego area. There is another large Korean American population in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Koreans are growing in number in the suburban Inland Empire region, in cities such as Chino Hills, Corona, Desert Hot Springs and Loma Linda south of San Bernardino. Since 1990, the Korean American and African American populations relocated westward and northward in the Los Angeles area.\n\nThe South Bay area and Little Tokyo have a large Japanese American community. Japanese Americans, however, are also concentrated in San Francisco and across the Bay Area, San Jose, the Salinas Valley and Santa Cruz County; and smaller communities in the Sacramento, Fresno, Bakersfield, Anaheim, San Diego, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara and Stockton areas. Despite the presence of Japanese goods stores, media outlets and restaurants in the state, most \"Little Tokyos\" and \"Japantowns\" were evacuated during the forced relocation of Japanese Americans during World War II (see Japanese American Internment). As a result, most Japanese Americans in urban areas do not reside in historical Japanese communities.\n\nCalifornia has the largest American population of Southeast Asians, concentrated in the Los Angeles-Long Beach, Sacramento, and Fresno areas. This includes the Hmong and Vietnamese, including Chinese Vietnamese. Long Beach has one of the largest Cambodian American communities in the United States. The neighboring cities of Westminster and Garden Grove have the largest Vietnamese American community outside of Vietnam and are often dubbed \"Little Saigon\". Vietnamese and Cambodian immigrants also settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, especially San Jose, Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, as well across the San Joaquin Valley and in San Diego.\n\nOver 6,000 Laotian Americans live in the Fresno area, including an even larger Hmong American community, the second-largest of its kind. Other Hmong colonies in the Central Valley of California and Northern California developed since the end of the Vietnam war (1975–79).\nCalifornia also has a Thai American community of over 250,000, concentrated in Southern California, with small Thai and Southeast Asian communities in Perris and Banning in the Inland Empire region. Los Angeles has the largest Thai population outside of Thailand and is also home to the world's first Thai Town. About 150,000 Indonesians live in Southern California, primarily the Los Angeles and San Diego areas.\n\nCalifornia has the largest Indian American population in the U.S. Many live in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, San Diego, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The Los Angeles suburbs of Artesia and Cerritos have large Indian American communities. San Jose, Fremont, and other Silicon Valley cities have many Indian Americans who are employed in the high-tech industry. Many Indian Americans are in Central Valley cities such as Stockton, Bakersfield, Fresno, Yuba City, and the Imperial Valley. Most South Asians in California are Indian American, but there are also Pakistani Americans, Bangladeshi Americans, and Sri Lankan Americans (see Sinhalese and Tamils) esp. concentrated in the San Gabriel Valley (Covina Valley) of the Los Angeles area.\n\nOver 50,000 Afghan Americans are concentrated in the East Bay primarily in Alameda County and its communities of Fremont and Hayward; Afghans also live throughout the state (esp. Orange County and Ventura County).\n\nThe state has 150,000 residents with Pacific Islander ancestry. Most, 80,000, are Native Hawaiians of measurable Polynesian ancestry; many also have Asian, European, or other ancestries. There are also 25,000 Samoan Americans originally from American Samoa or Western Samoa. Most live in Long Beach and the Los Angeles suburbs of Carson, Artesia, Cerritos, and Redondo Beach, Oceanside, and Upland. About 10,000 Chamorros from Guam and Northern Mariana Islands live in northern California, the largest Micronesian community in the mainland United States. An estimated 10,000 Tahitians from French Polynesia live in southern California.\nThere are also many Palauans in southern California, specifically in the San Diego area, including Vista. Only 677 in Vista alone in the 2010 US Census. Members of the Palauan community often also have Malay, Indonesian, Micronesian, Melanesian, Japanese, and other east Asian ancestries. Many Chuukese or Trukese live in San Diego, while the original settlers on Truk Island are Spanish and German but most Truukese now are Japanese and Korean, then Filipino and some Chinese, and finally the arrival of American expatriates. Many came to the Oceanside area due to the military installations around the city, which has the oldest Polynesian or Pacific Islander community. \n\nThe state also has over 715,000 Arab Americans, with large communities in Alameda, Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Orange, San Bernardino, San Diego, Sacramento and Stanislaus counties. They represent all Arab and Middle Eastern nationalities, the most numerous being of Gaza and West Bank (see Palestinian Americans) followed by those from Syria (see Syrian Americans) and Lebanon (about half- 1.5 out of 3.1 million estimated- (see Lebanese Americans) live in California), Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Arabs have resided in California since the 1920s, most notably in Orange County in the section of Little Arabia (Anaheim, California) and the San Diego area.\n\nAbout 500,000 Iranian Americans live throughout Southern California, including about 20% of the population of Beverly Hills. Iranian American communities also flourish in the San Fernando Valley, Orange County, San Diego, the Palm Springs area, and the San Joaquin Valley. The majority of Iranian Americans immigrated after the ouster of the pro-U.S. Shah regime of Iran in the late 1970s.\n\nCalifornia also has the third largest Greek American population in the United States, behind New York and Massachusetts.\n\nThere is also large population of Assyrian/Chaldean descent living in the Central Valley, with large communities in Modesto, Ceres and Turlock, as well as throughout the Central Coast and the California Desert (i.e. the Coachella and Imperial valleys). San Diego has one of the largest concentrations of Chaldean immigrants in the United States.\n\nCalifornia is also home to 600,000 Armenian Americans, with many in Glendale north of Los Angeles, as well as a large community in Fresno. As of 1988 California had about 500,000 ethnic Armenians with over half of them living in Greater Los Angeles. \n\nTurkish Americans and Azerbaijani Americans form moderately-sized communities in both Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nCalifornia has 2.3 million African Americans as of 2010, the largest population of Black or African Americans in the western U.S, and the 5th largest Black population in the United States. Cities that have the largest share of African Americans and have historically been Black cultural centers include (11 largest in the state): Compton, Inglewood, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, Richmond, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego and Vallejo.\n\nThere are many other cities and towns in the state with sizeable African American populations. These include:\n\nBerkeley,\nDublin,\nEast Palo Alto,\nFairfield,\nHayward,\nMarin City,\nPiedmont,\nSan Leandro,\nand Suisun City. Bakersfield,\nFresno,\nMerced,\nModesto,\nand Stockton. Adelanto,\nAltadena,\nApple Valley,\nCalifornia City,\nCarson,\nCorona,\nDesert Hot Springs,\nFontana,\nGardena,\nHawthorne,\nIndio,\nLakewood,\nLancaster,\nLynwood,\nMoreno Valley,\nNational City,\nOceanside,\nPalmdale,\nPalm Springs,\nPasadena,\nPerris,\nPomona,\nRialto,\nTwentynine Palms,\nand Victorville.\n\nAfrican Americans are approximately 7 percent of the state population. The state percentage of African Americans has dropped in the 1990s and 2000s, though the state's overall \"number\" of African-Americans has increased in that time period. The black population in East and West Oakland and South Central Los Angeles - places where they held the majority for decades - has greatly decreased as the black middle class has relocated to nearby suburbs, including those in the Inland Empire and Antelope Valley in Southern California and the Sacramento metropolitan area in Northern California. Many African Americans have also moved to the South, where their grandparents may have come from in the \"Great Migration\" of the mid-20th century.\n\nAfrican Americans have made a contribution to the state's hip-hop and R&B music culture. African-American musical artists born and/or raised in California include: Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, E-40, Nate Dogg, En Vogue, Tony! Toni! Tone!, Too Short, Eazy-E, N.W.A, Keyshia Cole, Digital Underground, JJ Fad, Barry White, The Pointer Sisters and Kendrick Lamar. \n\nAlso noted is California has small West Indian (Afro-Caribbean American) and African immigration from countries such as Cape Verde, Eritrea and Ethiopia (i.e. Little Ethiopia in West Los Angeles), Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa (including White South Africans), Tanzania and Yemen across from the Horn of Africa. They established communities in Los Angeles known for a large Ethiopian community and Oakland/Berkeley (East Bay) as well Nuer refugees from South Sudan migrated to the Sacramento area; and the Cape Verdean community in Solano County and the Santa Clara Valley, and the San Diego area.\n\nAs of 2010, California's Native American population of 362,801 was the most of any state. It also has the most Native American tribes, indigenous to the state or not, but the majority of known Californian Indian tribes became extinct in the late 19th century. The U.S. Census includes \"Latin American Indian\", especially immigrants who belonged to indigenous peoples or who have Amerindian heritage from North and South America.\n\nThe Cherokee Nation is the largest tribe in the state with a population of 110,000, although the number of Cherokee descendants may surpass 600,000 according to demographers. They are often descendants of Dust Bowl refugees in the 1930s and 1940s who migrated to the state's farming counties and urban areas for jobs. The largest urban American Indian communities are Los Angeles/Long Beach, San Francisco/Oakland, Sacramento, and San Diego areas. \n\nCalifornia also has significant populations of the Apache, Choctaw, Creek, Hopi, Zuni, Navajo, Blackfeet, Shoshone, Paiute, Pueblos, Cahuilla and Chumash tribes. The Cahuilla in the Coachella Valley have profited from real estate land leases, and much of Indio and Palm Springs are tribal-owned lands under legal tribal jurisdiction.\n\n\"Note: Births in table do not add up, because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number.\"\n\n\nAs of 2010, 20,379,282 of California residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 10,672,610 spoke Spanish, 1,231,425 Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), 796,451 Tagalog, 559,932 Vietnamese, 367,523 Korean, 192,980 Armenian, and Persian was spoken as a main language by 203,770 of the population over the age of five. In total, 14,644,136 of California's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.\n\nComparatively, according to the 2007 American Community Survey, 42.6 percent of California's population older than five spoke a language other than English at home, with 73 percent of those also speaking English well or very well, while 9.8 did not speak English at all.\n\nCalifornia had the highest concentration of Vietnamese or Chinese speakers in the United States, second highest concentration of Korean or Spanish speakers in the United States, and third highest concentration of Tagalog speakers in the United States. California was historically one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world, and is home to more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in 6 language families. A survey conducted between 2007 and 2009 identified 23 different indigenous languages of Mexico that are spoken among California farmworkers.\n\nOver 200 languages are known to be spoken and read in California, with Spanish used as the state's \"alternative\" language. California has more than 100 indigenous languages, making California one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world. All of California's indigenous languages are endangered, although there are now efforts toward language revitalization.\n\nThe official language of California has been English since the passage of Proposition 63 in 1986. However, many state, city, and local government agencies still continue to print official public documents in numerous languages. For example, the California Department of Motor Vehicles offers the written exam for the standard C Class driver's license in 31 languages along with English, and the audio exam in 11 languages. The politics of language is a major political issue in the state, especially in regard to language policy controlling the teaching and official use of immigrant languages.\n\nAs a result of the state's increasing diversity and migration from other areas across the country and around the globe, linguists began noticing a noteworthy set of emerging characteristics of spoken English in California since the late 20th Century. This dialect, known as California English, has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from the dialects used in other regions of the country.\n\nCalifornia has the most Roman Catholics in the United States, ahead of New York State, as well as large Protestant, non-religious, Jewish, and Muslim populations. It also has the largest Mormon population outside of Utah. The state also has a large American Jewish community, the largest in the western U.S., mainly concentrated in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento and Palm Springs. It also has large Muslim communities in west Los Angeles, San Diego, Beverly Hills, Orange County, Santa Clara County, and the Modesto area. Religions indigenous to California includes LaVeyan Satanism.\n\nMost Roman Catholics in California are of Mexican, other Hispanic, Spanish, Irish, Italian and Filipino ancestry. The population of Catholic Californians is rapidly growing due to the influx of Latin American and Filipino immigrants. In the state, Roman Catholicism is highly represented among non-Hispanic European-Americans, but less represented among non-Hispanic African-Americans. Protestantism is the majority Christian denomination in non-Hispanic black and white groups.\n\nThe largest Christian denominations in California in 2000 were the Roman Catholic Church with 10,079,310; the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 529,575; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 471,119. Jewish congregations had 994,000 adherents, or 3% of the Californian population.\n\nHinduism, Buddhism, Shintō, Sikhism, and Taoism were introduced in part by Asian immigrants. As the twentieth century came to a close, forty percent of all Buddhists in America resided in Southern California. The Los Angeles metropolitan area has become unique in the Buddhist world as the only place where representative organizations of every major school of Buddhism can be found in a single urban center. The City of Ten Thousand Buddhas in Northern California and Hsi Lai Temple in Southern California are two of the largest Buddhist temples in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nCalifornia has the highest Hindu population in the United States, most of them Indian Americans. Many of the prominent Hindu temples including the Malibu Hindu Temple are located in California.\n\nWith almost one million Jews, California has the highest number of Jews of any state except New York. Many of these Jews live in the West Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley regions of Los Angeles. At the present time, one of California's Senators, Dianne Feinstein, is Jewish. Historic synagogues include Beth Jacob Congregation (Beverly Hills, California), Congregation B'nai Israel (Sacramento, California), and Temple Israel (Stockton, California). Chabad, The Rohr Jewish Learning Institute, and Aish HaTorah are active in California.\n\nCalifornia also has the largest Muslim community in the United States, an estimated one percent of the population, mostly residing in Southern California. Approximately 100,000 Muslims reside in San Diego.\n\nCalifornia has more members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and Temples than any state except Utah. Latter-day Saints (Mormons) have played important roles in the settlement of California throughout the state's history. For example, a group of a few hundred Mormon converts from the Northeastern United States and Europe arrived at what would become San Francisco in the 1840s aboard the ship \"Brooklyn\", more than doubling the population of the small town. A group of Mormons also established the city of San Bernardino in Southern California in 1851. According to the LDS Church 2014 statistics, 780,200 Mormons reside in the state of California, attending almost 1400 congregations statewide.\n\nThe Seventh-day Adventist Church is headquartered in Loma Linda in San Bernardino county 60 miles east of Los Angeles, where the church members form the majority of the town's population. The SDA church there has a university, a free hospital and a TV station (3ABN or the 3 Angels Broadcasting Network). Seventh-day Adventists are vegetarians, so you would notice there are no fast food restaurants within the town limits. The town is known for a large number of centenarians who live over 100 years of age.\n\nA Pew Research Center survey revealed, however, that California is less religious than the rest of the United States: 62% of Californians say they are \"absolutely certain\" of the belief \"in God or a universal spirit\", while in the nation 71% say so. The survey also revealed that 48% of Californians say religion is \"very important\", while the figure for the U.S. in general is 56%. The state's non-religious, which consists of atheists, agnostics, and non-affiliated theists, is one of the fastest-growing groups in the state.\n\nCalifornia's income distribution is quite broad compared to the country's as a whole; its proportions of residents with no income and of residents with income over $100,000 are both higher than the national average. This broad distribution combined with high housing and living costs give California an abnormally high poverty rate. The Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure, calculated by comparing household income to a locally-adjusted poverty threshold, reports that 20.7% of California's population has income insufficient for their basic needs, as compared to 12.9% for the U.S. as a whole. This calculation of income includes the benefits of California welfare programs such as food stamps and earned income tax credits — without these, the state's poverty rate would be 28%.\n\nThe trends of low income in California are complex; from 1975 to 2014, real (inflation-adjusted) incomes have alternated between rises and sharp declines. These incomes have decreased overall for those outside the top 20th percentile, with the bottom 20th percentile seeing an average decline of 1% per year during that period. Correspondingly, the percent of Californians with income below their poverty threshold has risen and fallen, but has on average increased by a tenth of a percentage point per year.\n\nIncreasing income inequality has had many effects on Californians' lives, including on life expectancy, which can be taken as a proxy for health or even general welfare. A study conducted by Clarke et al. related life expectancy to socioeconomic status (SES, an index including income and other related factors), finding that Californians in the top 20% by SES live on average six years longer than those in the bottom 20% (81 years, compared to 75). This disparity becomes even more pronounced when intersected with race: White males in the top 20% live 14 years longer than African American males in the bottom 20% (for females, the difference is 10 years).\n\nThe complexity of the state's low-income trends were visible when, in response to growing Chinese and Spanish-speaking populations, the city of Oakland implemented the nation's first policy of recruiting bilingual applicants for public-facing city jobs in 2001. This increased the employment of Hispanic and Chinese bilinguals throughout the public workforce, but also lowered (monolingual) Black employment.\n"}

Pritchard (June 5, 1907 – May 9, 1995) was a scholar of China and one of the founders of the Association for Asian Studies and served as its president. \n\nPritchard was born on June 5, 1907, in Pullman, Washington, where he spent his childhood on the farm of his father, Thomas Pritchard. He attended Washington State College and graduated with his B.A. in 1928. He then attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where completed his M.A. in 1929. Returning to Pullman in 1930, he applied for a Rhodes Scholarship and became the second student from Washington State College to win the scholarship. He spent three years at the University of Oxford and was awarded his PhD in history in 1933.\n\nAfter completing his doctoral dissertation, Pritchard taught at Reed College in Portland, Oregon from 1934 until transferring to Washington State in 1935, where he stayed until 1937. He studied Chinese at Columbia University and the University of Michigan between 1937 and 1939, but he later regretted that his Chinese did not reach the level of proficiency he felt any serious student of China should be. \n\nPritchard taught at Wayne State University in Detroit between 1939 and 1947. This stint was interrupted from 1942 to 1945 when he was a civilian analyst with military intelligence during the Second World War. He was in charge of a 15-20 person group that studied Japanese transportation networks in China and Japan. He was the first recipient of the War Department's highest award for intelligence service, the Distinguished Civilian Service Medal. After the end of the war, he was an Associate Professor of history at the University of Chicago from 1947 until 1962. He was disappointed when the Fulbright Fellowship that he earned in 1948 to go to China was canceled because of the Communist revolution led by Mao Zedong that was sweeping away the nationalist forces of Chiang Kai-shek at the time. Pritchard never had an opportunity to visit the country he researched and taught about for most of his life, although he did travel to Japan in 1957. He moved to Tucson in Arizona to assume the chair of the Oriental Studies Department at the University of Arizona. He significantly built up the program until his retirement in 1972. He taught for several more years as Professor Emeritus.\n\nPritchard was the founder and editor of the \"Bulletin of Far Eastern Bibliography\", which became the Far Eastern Quarterly before assuming its present form as the Journal of Asian Studies. He was one of the founders of the Far Eastern Association, which later became the Association for Asian Studies. Se served as the president from 1962 to 1963, vice president from 1961 to 1962, was a director in 1948–51, 1952–55, and 1961–64.\n\nHe cited the major achievements of his career as the foundation of what was to become the Association for Asian Studies and the Journal of Asian Studies, and secondly the growth of the oriental studies at the University of Arizona. He cited as his third most important achievement the publication of \"Anglo-Chinese Relations During the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries’’ (a compacted version of his M.A. thesis), \"The Crucial Years of Early Anglo-Chinese Relations 1750-\n1800\" (based in part on his doctoral thesis, 1936), sections written for \"The American Historical Association's Guide to Historical Literature\" (1961), the coauthoring of Volume 4 of the UNESCO \"History of Mankind: Cultural and Scientific Development\". \n\nHe died on May 9, 1995, in Tucson at the age of 87.\n"}
{"id": "967999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=967999", "title": "Eegah", "text": "Eegah\n\nEegah (also known as Eegah: The Name Written in Blood) is a 1962 American horror film directed and produced by Arch Hall, Sr. (credited as Nicholas Merriwether), written by Bob Wehling based on a story by Hall Sr., and starring Hall Sr., Hall Jr., Marilyn Manning and Richard Kiel in the title role.\n\nThe film's notoriety was enhanced as a result of being featured on episodes of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" and \"Elvira's Movie Macabre\", and was said by many to be an all-time worst film. It was also listed in Michael Medved's book \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\".\n\nOne night after shopping, Roxy Miller (Marilyn Manning) is driving to a party through the California desert when she nearly runs her car into Eegah (Richard Kiel), a giant caveman. She tells her boyfriend Tom Nelson (Arch Hall, Jr.) and her father Robert Miller (Arch Hall, Sr.) about the giant. Her father, a writer of adventure books, decides to go into the desert to look for the creature and possibly take a photograph of it. When his helicopter ride fails to show up at his designated pickup time, Tom and Roxy go looking for him.\n\nRoxy is soon kidnapped by Eegah and taken back to his cave while Tom searches for her. In Eegah's cave, Roxy is reunited with her father, who tells her that he has begun to communicate with the caveman and has developed a theory as to the creature's astounding longevity. When a frisky Eegah expresses what seems to be romantic interest in Roxy, her father, fearful that the creature may kill them both if he is rebuffed, suggests she put up with as much of it as she can bear. Eegah never tries anything too explicit, though, and Roxy even ends up giving him a shave before Tom arrives and helps the Millers escape. Crushed, Eegah follows them back to civilization, a final confrontation ensues, and Eegah is killed.\n\n\nFollowing the financial success of his first venture into the drive-in/juvenile delinquency genre, \"The Choppers\", Arch Hall, Sr. was able to fund \"Eegah\", a starring vehicle for his son, Arch Hall, Jr., who had some success with songwriter Alan O'Day on the rock and roll/surf rock scene in Los Angeles. Hall, Sr. co-wrote the film with Bob Wehling, directed the picture under the pseudonym Nicholas Merriweather, and co-starred opposite his son under the name William Watters. While the library music used to underscore the picture was supplied by André Brummer (under the name Henri Price), an uncredited O'Day ended up being the music editor on \"Eegah\".\n\nHall, Sr. looked to create an Elvis Presley-style screen persona for his son, and made sure that \"Eegah\" was peppered with various rock and roll songs (including two songs he wrote called \"Vicky\" and \"Valerie\"). The film attempts elements of traditional schlock-horror and youth-comedy genres, and contains echoes of the 1960s \"beach party\" genre. One of the members of the rock and roll band shown in the film was Deke Lussier, who, as Deke Richards, later became a highly respected songwriter and record producer at Motown Records.\n\nHall Sr.'s company, \"Fairway-International Pictures\", located in Burbank, California, was also Hall's place of residence and doubled for a number of locations in the picture, including the Millers' apartment.\n\nAssistant cameraman Ray Dennis Steckler appears in the picture as Mr. Fischer, the man at the hotel who is thrown at the pool near the end of the picture. Steckler, who had previously moved to Hollywood to become a cameraman, made his directing debut the next year in the Arch Hall, Jr. vehicle \"Wild Guitar\". Steckler's first independent feature, \"The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies!!?\", was later distributed by Fairway-International.\n\nThe film is in public domain, and is available in several collection and stand-alone versions. The \"MST3K\" version of the movie was released on DVD in March 2000 by Rhino Home Video. As of January 2010 the DVD is out-of-print, and as of July 2011 it is no longer available on \"MST3K\"s official website. The film is available on archive.org https://archive.org/details/Eegah As of March 2017, the MST3K episode is available on Netflix. It is also included in the twelve-volume DVD collection, \"SciFi Classics\" released through Mill Creek Entertainment.\n\nApprehensive Films later released the \"Cinema Insomnia\" episode onto DVD.\n\nConsidered one of the worst films ever, the first real notoriety the film had, past its initial release, was being included in the Michael Medved book, \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\".\nFilm critic Leonard Maltin gave the film a BOMB, his lowest rating possible, calling it \"A staple at 'All-Time Worst Film' festivals\".\nThe film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\" as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.\n\nIn 1993, \"Eegah!\" was featured on Comedy Central's cult television series \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" and became a fan favorite. In the published episode guide to the series, \"The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide\" (), the cast considers the shaving scene from \"Eegah\", in which Eegah lolls his tongue around and laps up shaving cream, to be one of the most disgusting things they have witnessed during their time on the show. The writers also speculate that some kind of romantic relationship existed between Arch Hall, Sr. and his on-screen daughter Marilyn Manning, due to the uncomfortably non-familial chemistry in their scenes together. One of the film's more inept moments became a running joke on the show: Hall, Sr.'s line \"Watch out for snakes!\" is blurted out despite a lack of any visual source for the dialog. The line became a running gag, both on other episodes of the show and was referenced in \"The Office\" and as the closing line of \"The Rick Emerson Show\".\n\n\"Eegah!\" also appeared on an episode of \"Movie Macabre\", featuring Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.\n\nA heavily edited version accompanied by lampooning thought bubbles and comedic sound effects was included on Channel 4s Exploitica.\n\nIn 2009, \"Eegah!\" was shown on horror hosted television series \"Cinema Insomnia\".\n\nA remake of \"Eegah!\" is the second half of Impact Theatre's production of Splathouse Double Feature: \"The Sadist\" with \"Eegah!\", a stage and film hybrid that features newly shot footage for each production. The production on the remake began in January 2014 as the second project of the newly formed theatre troupe, p.d. and the bug. Michael Garrett McDonald stars as Tom with Sarah Coykendall playing Roxy. Mike Delaney portrays Roxy's father, Robert, and Eegah! is played by Joseph Mason. The newly filmed footage for Eegah! was shot and directed by Edwin Fernando Gonzalez. The first professional production of Splathouse Double Feature: The Sadist with Eegah! opened July 3, 2014 at Impact Theatre in Berkeley, CA.\n\nIn 2017, the rebooted \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" launched a live tour (\"The 'Watch Out for Snakes' Tour\"), performing new material with \"Eegah\" in several US cities.\n\n"}

More specifically it is the communication of information about, or the explanation of, the nature, origin, and purpose of historical, natural, or cultural resources, objects, sites and phenomena using personal or non-personal methods. Some international authorities in museology prefer the term mediation for the same concept, following usage in other European languages.\n\nHeritage interpretation may be performed at dedicated interpretation centres or at museums, historic sites, parks, art galleries, nature centres, zoos, aquaria, botanical gardens, nature reserves and a host of other heritage sites. Its modalities can be extremely varied and may include guided walks, talks, drama, staffed stations, displays, signs, labels, artwork, brochures, interactives, audio-guides and audio-visual media. The process of developing a structured approach to interpreting these stories, messages and information is called interpretive planning. The thematic approach to heritage interpretation advocated by University of Idaho professor Sam Ham, the National Association for Interpretation, the US National Park Service, and others, is considered best practice.\n\nThose who practice this form of interpretation may include rangers, guides, naturalists, actors (who may wear period dress and do reenactments), museum curators, natural and cultural interpretive specialists, interpretation officers, heritage communicators, docents, educators, visitor services staff, interpreters or a host of other titles. The interpretive process is often assisted by new technologies such as visualizing techniques.\n\nThe goal of interpretation is to improve and enrich the visitor experience by helping site visitors understand the significance of the place they are visiting, and connecting those meanings to visitors' own personal lives. By weaving compelling, thematic stories about environmental phenomena and historical events, interpreters aim to provoke visitors to learn and think about their experiences.\nEffective interpretation enables the visitors to make associations between the information given and their previous perceptions. According to Moscardo interpretation can produce 'Mindful Visitors' who are carefully processing information and negotiating the meanings of the observed object or intangible element.\n\nInterpretation is often used by landowning government agencies and NGOs to promote environmental stewardship of the lands they manage.\n\nIn his 1957 book, \"Interpreting Our Heritage\", Freeman Tilden defined six principles of interpretation:\nFor the past 50 years, Tilden's principles have remained highly relevant to interpreters across the world. In 2002 Larry Beck and Ted Cable published \"Interpretation for the 21st Century - Fifteen Guiding Principles for Interpreting Nature and Culture\", which elaborated upon Tilden's original principles. In 2011, Beck and Cable released a new version of their principles in \"The Gift of Interpretation\".\n\n\n\n"}

ISAW's mission is to cultivate comparative, connective investigations of the ancient world from the western Mediterranean to China. Areas of specialty among ISAW's faculty include the Greco-Roman world, the Ancient Near East, Egypt, Central Asia and the Silk Road, East Asian art and archaeology, Late Antiquity and the early Middle Ages, ancient science, and digital humanities.\n\nISAW was founded in 2006 with funding from the Leon Levy Foundation, established to continue the philanthropic legacy of Leon Levy, co-founder of the Oppenheimer mutual funds. Long interested in ancient history, Levy in his final years, along with his wife Shelby White, began discussions about the creation of a path-breaking institute where advanced scholars would explore trade and cultural links among ancient civilizations. After Levy’s death in 2003, one of the earliest initiatives of the Leon Levy Foundation, was the fulfillment of that plan. ISAW is a discrete entity within New York University, independent of any other school or department of the university, with its own endowment and its own board of trustees, and is housed in separate facilities in a historic six-story limestone on East 84th Street in Manhattan.\n\nThe Director of ISAW is Alexander Jones (classicist). He succeeded the founding director Roger Bagnall in September, 2016.\n\nAs of September 1, 2018, the following individuals served as ISAW faculty:\n\nAs of September 1, 2018, Senior Staff Members included:\n\nISAW's website describes its governance structure as follows:\n\nAppointments and academic programs of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World are under the jurisdiction of its faculty, which achieved independent status in fall, 2010, and which is led by the Director. The Director reports to the Provost and President of New York University. In addition, the Institute has its own Director's Council. Its chair is the Institute's Founder, Shelby White. The Council plays a crucial role in ensuring that ISAW fulfills its mission and has the means necessary to do so. It provides essential advice to the Director on strategic directions and public programming, and its members are vital ambassadors for ISAW in enlarging the public reached by its work. \n\nISAW's graduate program offers a PhD in the Study of the Ancient World.\n\nISAW offers hosts visiting research scholars conducting postdoctoral research. There are three types of appointment for visiting scholars:\n\n\nScholars in all three categories are expected to be in residence at ISAW for the duration of their appointment and to participate in the intellectual life of the community, including presenting a public lecture.\n\nIn order to support its mission of communicating information about antiquity to the public, ISAW organizes public exhibitions. Past exhibitions include:\n\n\nMost exhibitions have been accompanied by illustrated catalogs, many of which are co-published by ISAW and Princeton University Press.\n\nISAW houses a research library of approximately 40,000 non-circulating print volumes. The ISAW Library is a branch library of the NYU Division of Libraries, with facilities located on four floors of ISAW's facilities on East 84th Street. The library is open to members of the ISAW and NYU communities, as well as to scholars from other institutions who can demonstrate a need to access materials in the collection for their research.\n\nParticular areas of strength in the ISAW Library's print collection include Greek and Roman material culture and history, Papyrology, Egyptology, Mesopotamian Archaeology and Assyriology, Central Asia and Iran, and Early China.\n\nThe library is engaged in providing access and support for new and emerging forms of digital scholarship, scholarly communication, and pedagogy in ancient studies.

Archetypally, it was the period of time between the reign of one monarch and the next (coming from Latin \"inter-\", \"between\" and \"rēgnum\", \"reign\" [from \"rex, rēgis\", \"king\"]), and the concepts of interregnum and regency therefore overlap. Historically, the longer and heavier interregna were typically accompanied by widespread unrest, civil and succession wars between warlords, and power vacuums filled by foreign invasions or the emergence of a new power. A failed state is usually in interregnum.\n\nThe term also refers to the periods between the election of a new parliament and the establishment of a new government from that parliament in parliamentary democracies, usually ones that employ some form of proportional representation that allows small parties to elect significant numbers, requiring time for negotiations to form a government. In the UK, Canada and other \"first past the post\" electoral systems, this period is usually very brief, except in the rare occurrence of a hung parliament as occurred both in the UK in 2017 and in Australia in 2010. In parliamentary interregnums, the previous government usually stands as a caretaker government until the new government is established.\n\nSimilarly, in some Christian denominations, “interregnum” (interim) describes the time between vacancy and appointment of priest or pastors to various roles. Additionally, the term has been applied to the period of time between the election of a new President of the United States and his or her inauguration, during which the outgoing president remains in power, but as a lame duck. \n\nParticular historical periods known as interregna include:\n\nIn some monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, an \"interregnum\" is usually avoided due to a rule described as \"The King is dead. Long live the King\", i.e. the heir to the throne becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor's death or abdication. This famous phrase signifies the continuity of sovereignty, attached to a personal form of power named \"Auctoritas\". This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch's reign begins only with coronation or some other formal or traditional event. In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth for instance, kings were elected, which often led to relatively long interregna. During that time it was the Polish primate who served as an interrex (ruler between kings). In Belgium the heir only becomes king upon swearing before the parliament.\n\nA \"Papal interregnum\" occurs upon the death or resignation of the Pope, though this is generally known as a \"sede vacante\" (literally \"when the seat is vacant\"). The interregnum ends immediately upon election of a new Pope by the College of Cardinals.\n\n\"Interregnum\" is the term used in the Anglican Communion to describe the period before a new parish priest is appointed to fill a vacancy. During an interregnum, the administration of the parish is the responsibility of the churchwardens.\n\nWhen the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints dies, the First Presidency is dissolved and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles becomes the Church's presiding body. Any members of the First Presidency who were formerly members of the Twelve rejoin that quorum. The period between the death of the President and the reorganization of the First Presidency is known as an \"Apostolic Interregnum\"\n\nFIDE, the world governing body of international chess competition, has had two Interregnum periods of having no chess champions, both during the 1940s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18621845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18621845", "title": "Jean-Luc Picard", "text": "Jean-Luc Picard\n\nJean-Luc Picard is a fictional character in the \"Star Trek\" franchise, most often seen as the Captain of the starship USS \"Enterprise\"-D. He appears in the television series \"\" (TNG), the feature films \"Star Trek Generations\" (1994), \"\" (1996), \"\" (1998), and \"\" (2002), and is planned to feature as the central character in an as yet untitled forthcoming \"Star Trek\" show currently in development. He is portrayed by actor Patrick Stewart.\n\nAfter the success of the contemporary \"Star Trek\" feature films, a new \"Star Trek\" television series featuring a new cast was announced on October 10, 1986. \"Star Trek\" creator Gene Roddenberry named Picard for one or both of the twin brothers Auguste Piccard and Jean Felix Piccard, 20th-century Swiss scientists.\n\nPatrick Stewart, who has a background of theatre at the Royal Shakespeare Company, was initially considered for the role of Data. Roddenberry did not want to cast Stewart as Picard, since he had envisioned an actor who was \"masculine, virile, and had a lot of hair\". Roddenberry's first choice was Stephen Macht, and it took \"weeks of discussion\" with Robert H. Justman, Rick Berman, and the casting director to convince him that \"Stewart was the one they had been looking for to sit in the captain's chair\"; Roddenberry agreed after auditioning every other candidate for the role. The other actors considered included Yaphet Kotto, Patrick Bauchau, Roy Thinnes and Mitchell Ryan.\n\nStewart was uncertain why the producers would cast 'a middle-aged bald English Shakespearean actor' as captain of the \"Enterprise\". He had his toupee delivered from London to meet with Paramount executives, but Roddenberry ordered Stewart to remove the \"awful looking\" hairpiece. Stewart's stentorian voice impressed the executives, who immediately approved the casting. Roddenberry sent Stewart C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels, saying the Picard character was based on Hornblower, but Stewart was already familiar with the character, having read the books as a teenager.\n\nAs the series progressed, Stewart exercised more control over the character's development. By the time production began on the first \"Next Generation\" film, \"it was impossible to tell where Jean[-]Luc started and Patrick Stewart ended\", and by the fourth film, Stewart stated:\n\nHowever, Stewart stated that he is not nearly as serious or brooding as his alter ego.\n\nStewart also stated, \"One of the delights of having done this series and played this role is that people are so attracted to the whole idea of \"Star Trek\"... several years after the series has ended... I enjoy hearing how much people enjoyed the work we did... It's always gratifying to me that this bald, middle-aged Englishman seems to connect with them\". Stewart has commented that his role has helped open up Shakespeare to science fiction fans. He has noted the \"regular presence of Trekkies in the audience\" whenever he plays theater, and added: \"I meet these people afterwards, I get letters from them and see them at the stage door... And they say, 'I've never seen Shakespeare before, I didn't think I'd understand it, but it was wonderful and I can't wait to come back.'\"\n\nA new \"Star Trek\" series was announced by CBS All Access, Alex Kurtzman and Patrick Stewart in July 2018. Stewart has been cast to reprise his role as Picard.\n\nJean-Luc Picard was born to Maurice and Yvette Picard in La Barre, France, on 13 July 2305, and he dreamed of joining Starfleet. He and the rest of his family speak English, with English accents—the French language having become obscure by the 24th century, as mentioned in the \"Next Generation\" episode \"\". Suspiciously, Picard also has a number of British habits, including the regular consumption of Earl Grey tea, a fondness for Shakespeare, which he performs - authentically enough given the origins of The Bard , riding horses with English tack and a knowledge of such British songs with Royal Navy associations as \"A British Tar\" (Gilbert and Sullivan) and \"Heart of Oak\". The young Picard failed his first Starfleet Academy entrance exam, and, upon admission, met with numerous ethical/scholastic difficulties during his cadet career, but went on to flourish, developing a lifelong passion for archaeology, and he became the first freshman to win the Academy marathon. Shortly after graduation, Picard was stabbed in the heart by a Nausicaan, leaving the organ irreparable and requiring replacement with a parthenogenetic implant; this would prove near-fatal . Picard eventually served as first officer aboard the USS \"Stargazer\", which he later commanded. During that time, he invented a warp-speed starship battle tactic that would become known as the Picard Maneuver.\n\nDepicted as deeply moral, highly logical, and intelligent, Picard is a master of diplomacy and debate who resolves seemingly intractable issues between multiple, sometimes implacable parties with a Solomon-like wisdom. Though such resolutions are usually peaceful, Picard is also shown using his remarkable tactical cunning in situations when it is required. Picard has a fondness for detective stories, Shakespearean drama, and archeology. He is frequently shown drinking Earl Grey tea and issuing the order, \"Make it so\", or, \"Engage\".\n\n\"\" depicts Picard's command of the USS \"Enterprise\" (NCC-1701-D). The pilot episode shows the ship's mission to investigate a problem at Farpoint Station, which becomes sidetracked when an entity known as Q makes Picard \"representative\" in a trial charging humanity with being a \"dangerously savage child-race\". Picard persuades Q to test humanity, and Q chooses as the test's first stage the crew's performance at Farpoint. The trial \"ends\" seven years later (when Q reminds Picard that it never does), in the , when humanity is absolved by Picard's demonstration that the species has the capacity to explore the \"possibilities of existence\".\n\nThe third-season finale, \"\", depicts Picard being assimilated by the Borg to serve as a bridge between humanity and the Borg (renamed Locutus of Borg); Picard's assimilation and recovery are a critical point in the character's development, and provided backstory for the film \"\" and the development of Benjamin Sisko, the protagonist of \"\". Stewart asked Roddenberry to keep Picard a Borg for a few more episodes beyond the third-season finale, as he thought that would be more interesting than simply restoring Picard in Part II. It is later revealed in \"First Contact\" that parts of Borg machinery were removed from inside Picard, but that he retains traumatic memories and lingering neurological aftereffects of assimilation (which become a pivotal plot twist in \"Star Trek: First Contact\").\n\nThe fourth-season episode \"\" reveals that Picard has a brother, Robert, who took charge of the family vineyards in La Barre after Picard joined Starfleet. Robert and his wife have a young son, René, who is Picard's nephew. In the film \"Star Trek Generations\", Picard is devastated to learn that Robert and René have both died in a fire, and worse, the loss makes him the last of the Picard family.\n\nPicard joins forces with the 23rd-century \"Enterprise\" captain James T. Kirk in \"Star Trek Generations\" to fight the film's villain Dr. Tolian Soran. Commanding the new USS \"Enterprise\"-E (after the \"Enterprise\"-D is destroyed in \"Generations\"), Picard again confronts the Borg in \"First Contact.\" Later, he defends the Prime Directive and fights the forced relocation of the Ba'ku in \"\", and encounters Shinzon, a Romulan-made clone of himself, in \"\".\n\nIn August 2018, it was reported that Patrick Stewart would reprise the role of Jean-Luc Picard in a new \"Star Trek\" series to be broadcast on CBS All Access, which would explore Picard's life 20 years after the events of \"Star Trek: Nemesis\". The show is expected to premiere in 2020.\n\nIn novels by Pocket Books, Picard has married Beverly Crusher, and they have a son named René Jacques Robert François Picard. Jean-Luc also corresponds regularly with Marie, his sister-in-law, who still maintains the family vineyards. As of 2385 in the novel miniseries \"Star Trek: The Fall\", Picard remains as commanding officer of the \"Enterprise\"-E.\n\nIn the comics miniseries \"Star Trek: Countdown\", a prequel to the \"Star Trek\" reboot (2009), Picard is depicted as having retired from Starfleet and becoming Federation Ambassador to Vulcan. In 2387, he works with Data, the new commanding officer of the \"Enterprise\"-E, Ambassador Spock, and the Romulan miner Nero to save the Romulan Star Empire from a cataclysmic supernova. He is present aboard the \"Enterprise\" as it confronts Nero, who has gone mad and begun killing non-Romulans after they fail to save Romulus. The \"Enterprise\" arrives too late to aid Ambassador Spock against Nero, believing both Spock and Nero to have been consumed by the artificial black hole that Spock created.\n\nThe character received critical acclaim among fans of \"The Next Generation\", and he is usually considered one of the top two captains in the \"Star Trek\" franchise – there are often lengthy and serious debates over whether Picard or James T. Kirk is the \"best\" Starfleet captain. A 1991 \"TV Guide\" cover story was titled \"It's Kirk vs. Picard: Experts and fans debate who's best\". In a more lighthearted take on the debate, the cover of a 1994 \"Mad\" magazine \"Star Trek\" special features both Kirk and Picard wrestling childishly to fit into the \"Enterprise\"s captain's chair, while Scotty and Worf watch their respective commanders with looks of astonishment. Picard is deemed the ultimate delegator of authority, knowing \"how to gather and use data better than any other \"Star Trek\" captain\". His leadership style \"is best suited to a large, process-centric, either geographically identical or diverse team\". Kirk and Picard are considered to be attentive to the needs of their respective crews. When Stewart and William Shatner were asked in 1991 how their characters would have dealt with Saddam Hussein, Shatner stated that Kirk would \"have told him to drop dead\" while Stewart joked that Picard \"would still be talking\".\n\nIn 2015, Stewart addressed a long-asked conundrum among \"Star Trek\" fans, \"If Kirk and Picard fought each other, who would win?\" in \"Smithsonian\" magazine, by saying Picard would prefer to negotiate in the hope of avoiding a fight altogether.\n\nUGO Networks listed Picard as one of their best heroes in entertainment, saying, \"He doesn't have Kirk's sense of panache, but he did have a tendency to take everything really, really seriously for years\". He also became a sex symbol.\n\nThe character of Jean-Luc Picard has also been portrayed by:\n\n"}
{"id": "12558498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12558498", "title": "Jewish mythology", "text": "Jewish mythology\n\nJewish mythology is a major literary element of the body of folklore found in the sacred texts and in traditional narratives that help explain and symbolize Jewish culture\nand Judaism. Elements of Jewish mythology have had a profound influence on Christian mythology and on Islamic mythology, as well as on world culture in general. Christian mythology directly inherited many of the narratives from the Jewish people, sharing in common the narratives from the Old Testament. Islamic mythology also shares many of the same stories; for instance, a creation-account spaced out over six periods, the legend of Abraham, the stories of Moses and the Israelites, and many more.\n\nJewish mythology contains similarities to the myths of other Middle Eastern cultures. The ancient Hebrews often participated in the religious practices of their neighbors, worshiping other gods alongside Yahweh. These pagan religions were forms of nature worship: their deities personified natural phenomena like storms and fertility. Because of its nature worship, Mircea Eliade argues, Near Eastern paganism expressed itself in \"rich and dramatic mythologies\" featuring \"strong and dynamic gods\" and \"orgiastic divinities\".\n\nThe writings of the Biblical prophets, including Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah, express a concept of the divine that is distinct from the mythologies of its neighbors. Instead of seeing the God of Israel as just one national god, these writings describe Yahweh as the one God of the entire universe.\n\nThe prophetic writings condemned Hebrew participation in nature worship, and did not completely identify the divine with natural forces. In so doing, they set the stage for a new kind of mythology — a mythology featuring a single God who exists beyond the natural world. Unlike Tammuz, who dies and revives along with the vegetation, the God of the Hebrew prophets exists beyond nature and, therefore, isn't bound by the natural rhythms, as Armstrong noted: \"Where the Babylonian gods were engaged in an ongoing battle against the forces of chaos, and needed the rituals of the New Year festival to restore their energies, Yahweh can simply rest on the seventh day, his work complete.\"\n\nThrough the prophets' influence, Jewish mythology increasingly portrayed God as aloof from nature and acting independently of natural forces. On one hand, this produced a mythology that was, in a sense, more complex. Instead of eternally repeating a seasonal cycle of acts, Yahweh stood outside nature and intervened in it, producing new, historically unprecedented events; Eliade wrote: \"That was theophany of a new type, hitherto unknown—\"the intervention of Jahveh in history\". It was therefore something irreversible and unrepeatable. The fall of Jerusalem does not repeat the fall of Samaria: the ruin of Jerusalem presents a new historic theophany, another 'wrath' of Jahveh. […] Jahveh stands out from the world of abstractions, of symbols and generalities; he acts in history and enters into relations with actual historical beings.\"\n\nOn the other hand, this transcendent God was absolutely unique and hard for humans to relate to. Thus, the myths surrounding Yahweh were, in a sense, less complex: they did not involve the acts of multiple, anthropomorphic gods. In this sense, \"Jahveh is surrounded by no multiple and varied myths\", and did not share in the \"rich and dramatic mythologies\" of his pagan counterparts.\n\nThe Hebrew prophets had to struggle against the nature gods' popularity, and Jewish mythology reflects this struggle. Karen Armstrong sees the creation myth of Genesis 1 as being something composed to do just this -- \"as a poised, calm polemic against the old belligerent cosmogonies\", particularly the Babylonian cosmogonic myth. The Babylonian \"Enûma Eliš\" describes the god Marduk earning kingship over the other gods, battling the monster Tiamat, and creating the world from her corpse. In contrast, Armstrong argues, in the Genesis account (and in the book of Isaiah that describe Yahweh's victory over the sea-monster Leviathan); she writes: \"the sun, moon, stars, sky and earth are not gods in their own right, hostile to Yahweh. They are subservient to him, and created for a purely practical end. The sea-monster is no Tiamat, but is God's creature and does his bidding.\" Armstrong also notes that in Psalm 82, Yahweh stands up in the Divine Council and condemns the pagan deities, saying that although they are gods, they will die like mortals.\nTwo creation stories are found in the first two chapters of the Book of Genesis. In the first Elohim, the Hebrew generic word for God, creates the heavens and the earth in six days, then rests on, blesses and sanctifies the seventh. In the second story, God, now referred to by the personal name Yahweh, creates Adam, the first man, from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden, where he is given dominion over the animals. Eve, the first woman, is created from Adam and as his companion. God creates by spoken command and names the elements of the world as he creates them.\n\nGenesis 1:1–2:3 creation order:\nIn the second story (Genesis 2:4–2:25) the order is different; God created man, the Garden of Eden and planted trees, the living creatures and then the first woman.\n\nMany of the Hebrews' neighbors had a \"combat myth\" about the good god battling the demon of chaos; one example of this mytheme is the Babylonian \"Enûma Eliš\". A lesser known example is the very fragmentary myth of Labbu. According to historian Bernard McGinn, the combat myth's imagery influenced Jewish mythology. The myth of God's triumph over Leviathan, a symbol of chaos, has the form of a combat myth. In addition, McGinn thinks the Hebrews applied the combat myth motif to the relationship between God and Satan. Originally a deputy in God's court, assigned to act as mankind's \"accuser\" (\"satan\" means \"to oppose\" - Hebrew: שָּׂטָן \"satan\", meaning \"adversary\"), Satan evolved into a being with \"an apparently independent realm of operation as a source of evil\" — no longer God's deputy but his opponent in a cosmic struggle.\n\nEven the Exodus story shows combat-myth influence. McGinn believes the \"Song of the sea\", which the Hebrews sang after seeing God drown the Egyptian army in the Red Sea, includes \"motifs and language from the combat myth used to emphasize the importance of the foundational event in Israel's religious identity: the crossing of the Red Sea and deliverance from the Pharaoh\". Likewise, Armstrong notes the similarity between pagan myths in which gods \"split the sea in half when they created the world\" and the story of the Exodus from Egypt, in which Moses splits the Sea of Reeds (the Red Sea) — \"though what is being brought into being in the Exodus, is not a cosmos but a people\". In any case, the motif of God as the \"divine warrior\" fighting on Israel's behalf is clearly evident in the Song of the Sea (Ex. 15). This motif recur in poetry throughout the Hebrew Scriptures (I Samuel 2; Zechariah 9:11-16;14:3-8).\n\nSome comparative mythologists think Jewish mythology absorbed elements from pagan mythology. According to these scholars, even while resisting pagan \"worship\", the Jews willingly absorbed elements of pagan \"mythology\".\n\nAccording to the creation narratives in Genesis, Adam and Eve were the first man and woman. In the Book of Genesis of the Hebrew Bible, chapters one through five, there are two creation narratives with two distinct perspectives. In the first, Adam and Eve (though not referenced by name) were created together in God's image and jointly given instructions to multiply and to be stewards over everything else that God had made. In the second narrative, God fashions Adam from dust and places him in the Garden of Eden where he is to have dominion over the plants and animals. God places a tree in the garden which he prohibits Adam from eating the fruit of. Eve is later created from one of Adam's ribs to be Adam's companion.\n\nThe biblical story of Garden of Eden, most notably in the Book of Genesis chapters 2 and 3, and also in the Book of Ezekiel depicts Adam and Eve as walking around the Garden of Eden naked due to their innocence. The man was free to eat off of any tree in the garden, but forbidden to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Last of all, the God made a woman (Eve) from a rib of the man to be a companion to the man. However, the serpent tricks Eve into eating fruit from the forbidden tree. Following Eve, Adam broke the commandment and ate of the forbidden fruit. God curses only the serpent and the ground. He prophetically tells the woman and the man what will be the consequences of their sin of disobeying God. Then he banishes \"the man\" from the Garden of Eden to prevent him from eating also of the tree of life, and thus living for ever. East of the garden there were placed Cherubim, \"and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life\". (Gen.3:24)\n\nThe story of the Garden of Eden makes theological use of mythological themes to explain human progression from a state of innocence and bliss to the present human condition of knowledge of sin, misery, and death.\n\nJoseph Campbell notes that the Garden of Eden narrative's forbidden tree is an example of a motif \"very popular in fairy tales, known to folklore students as the One Forbidden Thing\". For another example of the One Forbidden Thing, see the Serbian fairy tale Bash Chelik, in which the hero is forbidden to open a certain door but he does anyway, thereby releasing the villain. Also see the classic story of Pandora's box in ancient Greek mythology.\n\nThe story of the judgment of Sodom and Gomorrah is told in . Three men came to Abraham in the plains of Mamre. After the angels received the hospitality of Abraham and Sarah, \"the Lord\" revealed to Abraham that he would confirm what he had heard against Sodom and Gomorrah, \"and because their sin is very grievous\". At this time, \"the men of Sodom [were] wicked and sinners before the exceedingly\". Sodom was ruled by King Bera while Gomorrah was ruled by King Birsha.\n\nIn response, Abraham inquired of the Lord if he would spare the city if 50 righteous people were found in it, to which the Lord agreed he would not destroy it for the sake of the righteous yet dwelling therein. Abraham then inquired of God for mercy at lower numbers (first 45, then 40, then 30, then 20, and finally at 10), with the Lord agreeing each time. Two angels were sent to Sodom to investigate and were met by Abraham's nephew Lot, who convinced the angels to lodge with him, and they ate with Lot. Before they lay down, the men of the city demanded lot to bring the guests out onto them so that they may \"know them\". Lot refused to give his guests to the inhabitants of Sodom and, instead, offered them his two virgin daughters \"which have not known man\" and to \"do ye to them as \"[is]\" good in your eyes\". However, they refused this offer, complained about this alien, namely Lot, giving orders, and then came near to break down the door. Lot's angelic guests rescued him and struck the men with blindness and they informed Lot of their mission to destroy the city. Then (not having found even 10 righteous people in the city), they commanded Lot to gather his family and leave. As they made their escape, one angel commanded Lot to \"look not behind thee\" (singular \"thee\"). However, as Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed with brimstone and fire from the Lord, Lot's wife looked back at the city, and she became a pillar of salt.\n\nIn Abrahamic religions, Sodom and Gomorrah have become synonymous with impenitent sin, and their fall with a proverbial manifestation of divine retribution.\n\nThe Genesis flood narrative has similarities to ancient flood stories told worldwide. One of the closest parallels is the Mesopotamian myth of a world flood, recorded in \"The Epic of Gilgamesh\". In the Hebrew Bible flood story (Genesis 6:5-22), God decides to flood the world and start over, due to mankind's sinfulness. However, God sees that a man named Noah was righteous (because he walked with God) and blameless among the people. God instructs Noah to build an ark and directs him to bring at least two of every animal inside the boat, along with his family. The flood comes and covers the world. After 40 days, Noah sends a raven to check whether the waters have subsided, then a dove; after exiting the boat, Noah offers a sacrifice to God, who smells \"the sweet savour\" and promises never to destroy the earth by water again - making the rainbow a symbol of this promise. Similarly, in the Mesopotamian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", the bustle of humanity disturbs the gods, who decide to send a flood. Warned by one of the gods, a man named Utnapishtim builds a boat and takes his family and animals inside. After the flood, Utnapishtim sends a dove, then a swallow, then a raven to check whether the waters have subsided. After exiting the boat, Utnapishtim offers a sacrifice to the gods, who smell \"the sweet savour\" and repent their choice to send the flood.\n\nAnother ancient flood myth is the Hindu story of Matsya the fish. According to this story, the god Vishnu takes the form of a fish and warns the ancestor Manu about a coming flood. He tells Manu to put all the creatures of the earth into a boat. Unlike the Biblical and Mesopotamian floods, however, this flood is not a unique event brought on by a divine choice; instead, it's one of the destructions and recreations of the universe that happen at regular intervals in Hindu mythology.\n\nThe Patriarchs in Hebrew bible are Abraham, his son Isaac, and Isaac's son Jacob, also named Israel, the ancestor of the Israelites. These three figures are referred to collectively as the patriarchs of Judaism, and the period in which they lived is known as the patriarchal age. The narrative in Genesis revolves around the themes of posterity and land. Abraham is called by God to leave the house of his father Terah and settle in the land originally given to Canaan but which God now promises to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates are put forward who might inherit the land after Abraham; and, while promises are made to Ishmael about founding a great nation, Isaac, Abraham's son by his half-sister Sarah, inherits God's promises to Abraham. Jacob is the son of Isaac and Rebecca and regarded as a Patriarch of the Israelites as his twelve sons became the progenitors of the \"Tribes of Israel\".\nThe story of the exodus is told in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. The Israelites had settled in the Land of Goshen in the time of Joseph and Jacob, but a new pharaoh arose who enslaved and oppressed the children of Israel. At this time Moses was born; the Pharaoh had commanded that all male Hebrew children born would be drowned in the river Nile, but Moses' mother placed him in an ark and concealed the ark in the bulrushes by the riverbank, where the baby was discovered and adopted by Pharaoh's daughter, and raised as an Egyptian. One day after Moses had reached adulthood he killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew. Moses, in order to escape the Pharaoh's death penalty, fled to Midian.\n\nThere, on Mount Horeb, God appeared to Moses as a burning bush revealed to Moses his name YHWH and commanded him to return to Egypt and bring his chosen people (Israel) out of bondage and into the Promised Land. During the journey, God tried to kill Moses, but Zipporah saved his life. Moses returned to carry out God's command, but God caused the Pharaoh to refuse, and only after God had subjected Egypt to ten plagues did the Pharaoh relent. Moses led the Israelites to the border of Egypt, but there God hardened the Pharaoh's heart once more, so that he could destroy the Pharaoh and his army at the Red Sea Crossing as a sign of his power to Israel and the nations.\n\nFrom Egypt, Moses led the Israelites to biblical Mount Sinai, where he was given the Ten Commandments from God, written on stone tablets. Later at Mount Sinai, Moses and the elders entered into a covenant, by which Israel would become the people of YHWH, obeying his laws, and YHWH would be their god. Moses delivered the laws of God to Israel, instituted the priesthood under the sons of Moses' brother Aaron, and destroyed those Israelites who fell away from his worship. After the forty years had passed, Moses eventually led the Israelites into the Land of Canaan.\n\nGideon was a military leader, judge and prophet whose calling and decisive victory over the Midianites. He went on to send out messengers to gather together men in order to meet an armed force of the people of Midian and the Amalek that had crossed the Jordan River, and they encamped at the Well of Harod in the Valley of Jezreel. But God informed Gideon that the men he had gathered were too many – with so many men, there would be reason for the Israelites to claim the victory as their own instead of acknowledging that God had saved them. At first Gideon sent home those men who were afraid and invited any man who wanted to leave, to do so; 22,000 men returned home and 10,000 remained. Yet with the number, God told Gideon they were still too many; Gideon brought his troops to the water, where all those who lap the water with their tongues, were put to one side; all those who kneel down to drink, putting their hands to their mouths, were put to the other side. The number of those that lapped was three hundred; but all the rest of the troops knelt down to drink water. Then the Lord said to Gideon, “With the three hundred that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Midianites into your hand. Let all the others go to their homes.” ().\n\nDuring the night, God instructed Gideon to approach the Midianite camp. There, Gideon overheard a Midianite man tell a friend of a dream in which \"a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian\" (), causing their tent or camp to collapse. This was interpreted as meaning that God had given the Midianites over to Gideon. Gideon returned to the Israelite camp and gave each of his men a trumpet (\"shofar\") and a clay jar with a torch hidden inside. Divided into three companies, Gideon and his 300 men marched on the enemy camp. He instructed them to blow the trumpet, give a battle cry and light torches, simulating an attack by a large force. As they did so, the Midianite army fled (). Later, their leaders were caught and killed.\nSamson was the last of the judges of the ancient Israelites mentioned in the Book of Judges. The biblical account states that Samson was a Nazirite, and that he was given immense strength to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, however, if Samson's long hair was cut, then his Nazirite vow would be violated and he would lose his strength. The first instance of this is seen when Samson was on his way to ask for the Philistine woman's hand in marriage, when he was attacked by a lion. He simply grabbed it and ripped it apart, as the spirit of God divinely empowered him.\nAfter the philistines burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death, Samson, in revenge, slaughtered many more Philistines, saying, \"I have done to them what they did to me. Samson then took refuge in a cave in the rock of Etam. An army of Philistines came to the Tribe of Judah and demanded that 3,000 men of Judah deliver them Samson. In order to avoid a war and with Samson's consent, they tied him with two new ropes and were about to hand him over to the Philistines when he broke free of the ropes. Using the jawbone of a donkey, he slew 1,000 Philistines.\n\nSamson falls in love with Delilah in the valley of Sorek. The Philistines approach Delilah and induce her with 1,100 silver coins to find the secret of Samson's strength so that they can capture their enemy. While Samson refuses to reveal the secret and teases her with false answers, he finally wears down and tells Delilah that God supplies his power because of his consecration to God as a Nazirite and that if his hair is cut off he will lose his strength. Delilah then woos him to sleep \"in her lap\" and calls for a servant to shave his hair. Samson loses his strength and he is captured by the Philistines who blind him by gouging out his eyes. They then take him to Gaza, imprison him, and put him to work turning a large millstone and grinding corn.\n\nOne day, the Philistine leaders assemble in a temple for a religious sacrifice to Dagon, for having delivered Samson into their hands. They summon Samson so that people can watch him perform for them. The temple is so crowded and all the rulers of the entire government of Philistia have gathered there too, some 3,000 people in all. Samson is led into the temple, and he asks his captors to let him lean against the supporting pillars to rest. He prays for strength and God gives him strength to break the pillars, causing the temple to collapse, killing him and the people inside.\n\nAcademics have interpreted Samson as a demigod (such as Heracles or Enkidu) enfolded into Jewish religious lore, or as an archetypical folk hero.\n\nAccording to the Book of Samuel, Saul and the Israelites are facing the Philistines in the Valley of Elah. Goliath, the champion of the Philistines, comes out between the lines and challenges the Israelites to send out a champion of their own to decide the outcome in single combat, but Saul is afraid. David, bringing food for his elder brothers, hears that Goliath has defied the armies of God and of the reward from Saul to the one that defeats him, and accepts the challenge. Saul reluctantly agrees and offers his armor, which David declines, taking only his staff, sling ( \"\") and five stones from a brook.\n\nDavid and Goliath confront each other, Goliath with his armor and javelin, David with his staff and sling. David hurls a stone from his sling and hits Goliath in the center of his forehead, Goliath falls on his face to the ground, and David cuts off his head. The Philistines flee and are pursued by the Israelites \"as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron\". David puts the armor of Goliath in his own tent and takes the head to Jerusalem, and Saul sends Abner to bring the boy to him. The king asks whose son he is, and David answers, \"I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.\"\n\nThe story of the Tower of Babel explains the origin of different human languages. According to the story, which is recorded in , everyone on earth spoke the same language. As people migrated from the east, they settled in the land of Shinar (Mesopotamia). People there sought to make bricks and build a city and a tower with its top in the sky, to make a name for themselves, so that they not be scattered over the world. God came down to look at the city and tower, and remarked that as one people with one language, nothing that they sought would be out of their reach. God went down and confounded their speech, so that they could not understand each other, and scattered them over the face of the earth, and they stopped building the city. Thus the city was called Babel.\n\nAlso possibly derived from pagan mythology is the story of the \"Watchers\" (Genesis 6:1-4). According to this story, heavenly beings once descended to earth, intermarried with humans, and produced the \"nephilim\", \"the heroes of old, men of renown\". Jewish tradition regards those heavenly beings as wicked angels, but the myth may represent a fragment of pagan mythology about gods interbreeding with humans to produce heroes.\n\nR. C. Zaehner, a professor of Eastern religions, argues for Zoroastrianism's direct influence on Jewish eschatological myths, especially the resurrection of the dead with rewards and punishments.\n\nThe mythologist Joseph Campbell believes the Judeo-Christian idea of linear history originated with the Iranian religion of Zoroastrianism. In the mythologies of India and the Far East, \"the world was not to be reformed, but only known, revered, and its laws obeyed\". In contrast, in Zoroastrianism, the current world is \"corrupt [...] and to be reformed by human action\". According to Campbell, this \"progressive view of cosmic history\" \"can be heard echoed and re-echoed, in Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Aramaean, Arabic, and every tongue of the West\".\n\nOther traditional cultures limited mythical events to the beginning of time, and saw important historical events as repetitions of those mythical events. According to Mircea Eliade, the Hebrew prophets \"valorized\" history, seeing historical events as episodes in a continual divine revelation. This doesn't mean that \"all\" historical events have significance in Judaism; however, in Jewish mythology, significant events happen throughout history, and they are not merely repetitions of each other; each significant event is a new act of God:\nBy portraying time as a linear progression of events, rather than an eternal repetition, Jewish mythology suggested the possibility for progress. Inherited by Christianity, this view of history has deeply influenced Western philosophy and culture. Even supposedly secular or political Western movements have worked within the world-view of progress and linear history inherited from Judaism. Because of this legacy, the religious historian Mircea Eliade argues that \"Judaeo-Christianity makes an innovation of the first importance\" in mythology.\n\nEliade believes that the Hebrews had a sense of linear time before their contact with Zoroastrianism, but agrees with Zaehner that Judaism elaborated its mythology of linear time with eschatological elements that originated in Zoroastrianism. According to Eliade, these elements include ethical dualism, the myth of a savior, and \"an optimistic eschatology, proclaiming the final triumph of Good\".\n\nThe Jewish people's tendency to adopt the neighboring pagan practices, denounced as it had been by the Jewish prophets, returned with force during the Talmudic period. However, almost no mythology was borrowed until the Midrashic and Talmudic periods, when what can be described as mysticism emerged in the kabbalistic schools.\n\nOne such aspect was the appearance of the \"Shedim\", or demons; these became ubiquitous to the ordinary Jews with the increased access to the study of the Talmud after the invention of the printing press.\n\nThe classical rabbis themselves were at times not free from sharing in the popular beliefs. Thus, while there is a whole catalog of prognostications by means of Dreams in Ber. 55 et seq., and Rabbi Johanan claimed that those dreams are true which come in the morning or are dreamed about us by others, or are repeated, Rabbi Meïr declares that dreams help not and injure not. Dream interpretation is not however a factor in considering mythologyfication of Talmud knowledge since it was at the time a part of the wider nascent development of what later became the discipline of Psychology, and also incorporated Astrology, and effect of digestion on behaviour.\n\nAn example of typical mythology in the Talmud exists as a discussion about a giant deer and a giant lion which are both originated in a mythical forest called \"Bei Ilai\". ('Bei' means house in Aramaic) The deer is called \"keresh\", it has one horn, and its skin measures 15 cubits in length. The lion, called \"tigris\", is said to be so big that there is a space of 9 cubits between its ears. The Roman Caesar Hadrian once asked Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah to show him this lion, since every lion can be killed, but the Rabbi refused and pointed out that this is not a normal lion. The Roman Caesar insisted, so the Rabbi reluctantly called for the lion of \"Bei Ilai\". He roared once from a distance of 400 parasangs, and all pregnant women miscarried and all the city walls of Rome tumbled down. Then he came to 300 parasangs and roared again, and the front teeth and molars of Roman men fell out, and even the emperor himself fell from his throne. He begged the Rabbi to send it back. The Rabbi prayed and it returned to its place.\n\nThe authorities of the Talmud seem to be particularly influenced by popular conception in the direction of folk medicine. A belief in the Evil eye was also prevalent in Talmudic times, and occasionally omens were taken seriously, though in some cases recognized as being merely popular beliefs. Thus, while it is declared to be unlucky to do things twice, as eating, drinking, or washing, Rabbi Dunai recognized that this was an old tradition.\n\nA remarkable custom mentioned in the Talmud is that of planting trees when children are born and intertwining them to form the huppah when they marry. Yet this idea may be originally Iranian and is also found in India.\n\nIt may be possible to distinguish in the haggadic legends of Biblical character those portions that probably formed part of the original accounts from those that have been developed by the exegetic principles of the haggadists.\n\nThe uniqueness of the Talmudic style of both recording meaning and deriving it using exegesis places the many seemingly mythological components of the much larger halachic content into a content very unlike the purely story-telling corpus of other cultures.\n\nIn the past century to modern day, there have been many retellings of Jewish myths (mostly from the Torah), and adaptations for the modern public. They have mostly been in the regions of science fiction, as Isaac Asimov noted in his introduction to \"More Wandering Stars\":\nHe goes on to show parallels between biblical stories and modern science fiction tropes:\n\nThe Hugo Awards, one of the highest distinctions for science fiction writers, have been awarded to biblically derived stories. For instance Harlan Ellison's \"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\", Larry Niven's \"Inconstant Moon\" and Harlan Ellison's \"The Deathbird\".\n\nAnother example is Hideaki Anno's Neon Genesis Evangelion anime series, which uses kabbalah elements while narrating a reinterpretation of events surrounding Adam, Eve and Lilith in a futuristic and apocalyptic way.\n\nEdward M. Erdelac's weird western series Merkabah Rider features a Hasidic mystic gunslinger and draws heavily from Jewish myth and folklore.\n\nIt is often suggested that Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the two Jewish creators of Superman, essentially the beginning of superhero comics and comic books, were partly inspired by the story of the Golem of Prague.\n\n"}
{"id": "4485287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4485287", "title": "Legion of Net.Heroes", "text": "Legion of Net.Heroes\n\nThe Legion of Net.Heroes, or LNH, is the oldest (and perhaps the first) Usenet-based shared universe still in existence, and the name of the premiere \"net.hero\" team in that universe. Birthed from a rec.arts.comics cascade thread in April 1992 , it began as parody of the Legion of Super-Heroes (LSH), and other comic book superheroes. It featured characters like Cheesecake-Eater Lad (based on Matter-Eater Lad) and Super Apathy Lad defending the “Looniverse” from the likes of Lagneto (\"Lag\" spliced with \"Magneto\") and Doctor Killfile. Over time, it has evolved to include comedy, serious drama, character pieces and melodrama. With 181 stories posted in 2007, it is still active.\n\nOn April 27, 1992, rec.arts.comics member Bill Sherman, commenting on the correct spelling of the name Winsor McCay, declared himself \"Spelling Boy\" of the LSH. Two days later, Dan'l Danehy Oakes suggested that long-time posters form a Legion of Net. Heroes. He declared himself California Kid, \"whose power is to read comix weeks after everyone else has discussed 'em...\"\n\nThe thread took off, spawning 115 (mostly) on-topic replies and a large and diverse pool of \"net.heroes\". On May 5, Steve Librande, no doubt growing tired of the thread, declared himself \"the ingenious Doctor Killfile\"\n, threatening to \"release the awesome force of my patented Kill-O-Ray, destroying all posts about you blithering Net.Heroes!!\"\n\nBenjamin Pierce, in the net.persona of Marvel_Zombie Lad, rallied his fellow \"net.heroes\" to fight back. It was at this point that forty-four different authors began working on the first actual LNH story, later called \"The Cosmic Plot Device Caper\". At that time, Usenet users were primarily college students, and when summer vacation came, interest in the LNH waned.\n\nCome the fall, interest was stirred up again, primarily because of Todd \"Scavenger\" Kogutt. New LNH stories and new authors debuted on rec.arts.comics.misc (rec.arts.comics had become defunct in late 1992). Some authors created continuing \"series\", with issue numbers and serialised stories; the first of these was Kyle Lucke's \"Quest for Cheeze\", soon followed by Ray \"wReam\" Bingham's \"Ultimate Ninja\".\n\nMany posters on rec.arts.comics.misc were annoyed by the LNH stories in what was primarily a discussion newsgroup. \n\nThe LNH moved to their very own newsgroup, alt.comics.lnh, before finding their permanent home on rec.arts.comics.creative. RACC also hosts a number of other original fiction shared universes, such as ASH, OMEGA and 8FOLD. Occasionally RACC receives cross-posts from Superguy. It is moderated by Russ \"Eagle\" Allbery, who also maintains the eyrie ftp archives.\n\nThe world of the LNH, known as the Looniverse, is an alternate universe much like our own, but with the presence of net.heroes, net.ahumans, and net.villains.\n\nOne notable difference, besides the presence of superpowers, is that the vast majority of LNH characters are aware of the fourth wall: they know that they are fictional characters in fictional stories, and often will comment on bad characterizations and ludicrous plot-twists, sometimes talking directly to the audience or their author. Sometimes, the plot-twists themselves come out of fourth-wall breaking. For example, in Gary St. Lawrence's story, \"The Case of the Clueless Mystery\", the characters discover how to defeat the villain by consulting the script. Metafictional concepts such as Comedy and Drama are treated like real cosmic forces.\n\nThe Looniverse is also notable for its ability to simultaneously contain mutually exclusive ideas. In the work of Hubert Bartels, for example, mainstream comic books are treated something akin to movies: heroes audition for the likes of Rob Liefeld and Marv Wolfman and model for the penciller. Other authors treat the work of Marvel and DC as comic books that are products of their writer's imagination. Still others use parody titles to represent mainstream comics, i.e., \"Justice Mind-Wipers of America\" instead of \"Justice League of America\", \"New Adventists\" instead of \"New Avengers\".\n\nSome characters operate in a world of realistic physics; others operate by the laws of Cartoon physics. For some characters, time unfolds akin to real-world time; for others, all their lives have taken place in \"the last ten years\". Yet these characters can often meet and team-up in the same time-frame.\n\nThe humour of the LNH has broadened considerably from its joke-name beginnings, and now includes broad parody, subtle satire, and character humour. However, there are some major trends that have remained a constant thread throughout its lifetime.\n\nThe two prime targets of LNH parody are superheroes, and the Internet. In fact, net terminology and conventions extends even to the naming of characters and places: for example, Lurking Girl and Lurker Lad derive their invisibility powers from \"lurkers\", newsgroup readers who do not actively take part in the discussion, but rather, \"lurk\". Many of the cities in the Looniverse have net-based names: Net.ropolis and Sig.ago, for example.\n\nSince the day Dr. Killfile attacked the LNH, a number of LNH Writers have filled in the gaps within the Looniverse's back history. Retcons, however, often make the task of history scribing very difficult in an ever-changing Looniverse. The more popular ideas tend to remain and the other ones tend to disappear.\n\nBack during the 19th century, Net.ropolis was known as Babbagetown. Little is known of how far the origins of this city go back. The history of the LNHQ is also rather murky. What is known though is that the current LNHQ used to be the Net.ropolis Hotel Grand. \n\nSometime in the 1920s or 1930s, a hero by the name of Boy Lad formed the Legion of Net. Heroes. During this time, he was the only member (Boy Lad Jr., his sidekick, wasn't allowed to join, due to the \"no sidekicks are allowed to join\" rule). No one knows what ultimately happened to him although someone who claimed to be him made an appearance in the \"Omaha Project\" series.\n\nAfter Boy Lad disappeared, the Agents of P.U.L.P, Classic Squad, and Society of Wireless Heroes (A British-based super group) took over the hero game in the 1940s and 1950s. Some members of the Classic Squad would eventually become part of the current LNH incarnation like Old Comics Man, Golden Man, and Kid Yesterdaze.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Net.astic Nine and the Challengers of the Abominable helped protect Net.ropolis and the Looniverse from destructive forces. The LNHer Sig.Lad was formerly a member of the Net.astic Nine. At the end of the 60's, a demon going by the name of Anti-Christ Lad controlled all of Net.ropolis including the LNH that was operating during this time period: The Legion of Net. Hippies. Self-Righteous Preacher, after joining with the Legion of Net.Hippies helped free the LNH from Anti-Christ Lad's control and sent him back to hell. A few Legion of Net. Hippies like Nudist Man, Super Apathy Lad, and Procrastination Boy remained with the current Legion.\n\nIn the 1980s, The Legion of New-Wave Heroes arrived on the scene and quickly disappeared.\n\nAs to when the current incarnation of the LNH got its start is a subject of some debate. It could have begun a few days or a few years before the \"Cosmic Plot Device Caper\" depending on which stories one reads.\n\nAfter the \"Cosmic Plot Device Caper\", came the 2½ Month Gap, a mysterious period of which little is known. During this time period, Rebel Yell became leader of the LNH and Y-Plex Burp replaced Lurking Girl with an evil clone called Lurking Lass. After that a number of crises took shape. During a time called Beige Noon, two god like beings called Dekay and Diskolor attempted to drain the color from the Looniverse and turn it into a wasteland. This was followed by the RMGrouping of rec.arts.comics, which caused the entire LNH to be scattered across the Net. In \"501 Blues: The Long Road to Nowhere\", Rebel Yell tried to find all of the lost legionaries and succeeded in finding Lurking Girl.\n\nThis was followed by \"Cry.Sig\", a parody of Crisis on Infinite Earths, where the Crossover Queen caused tons of havoc (including destroying Canada with a reality ray). \"Cry.Sig\" gave LNH Writers an excuse for rampant retconning of continuity. Dial-D-for-Dvandom became the Dvandom Stranger and Pre-Cry.Sig Occultism Kid became the August One, mentor to the Post-Cry.Sig Occultism Kid.\n\nThe Ultimate Ninja joined with the LNH after Cry. Sig. Somewhere along the line the leadership of the LNH became a triumvirate with Rebel Yell, Continuity Champ, and the Ultimate Ninja each taking a share of LNH power.\n\nIn the \"Integrity Quest\", written by Doug P. Wojtowicz, Stephane Savoie, and Hubert Bartels, the characters Lost Cause Boy, Kid Anarky, and Panta the cat-girl were introduced; in the tenth installment, Wojtowicz referred to a penile erection as a \"woody\": this caused a minor controversy dubbed \"The Woody Scandal\", and resulted in the ostracization of Wojtowicz. Other stories of this era also skirted the line of good taste: Gary St. Lawrence's stories \"Pigs in Space\" and \"Passionfishing\", however, produced a much less volatile reaction. These three stories challenged the notions of what was acceptable content in LNH stories and led to the development of a \"mature audiences\" label, Acraphobe.\n\nIn 1993, Rebel Yell, due to events depicted in the \"Lurk of Faith\", took a leave of absence from the LNH (never returning), leaving the Ultimate Ninja in complete control. Myk-El was revealed to be a traitor and killed by the Ultimate Ninja. The Secret Dvanders dug up Myk-El's grave, not convinced that he was indeed a traitor in \"Constellation #27\", which set up the beginning for Retcon Hour.\n\n\"Retcon Hour\", a parody of Zero Hour, was the biggest planned crossover the LNH has ever had. At least fourteen writers took part in it, it touched both the PULP and NTB imprints, and also was linked with the Omaha Project series. During the chaos involved with transferring the Looniverse from alt.comics.lnh to rec.arts.comics.creative, two Time Crappers (post and pre-Cry. Sig), and wReamicus Maximus (wielding the all-powerful Ring of Retcon) washed the Looniverse over with a number of retcons in order to take control of it. Contraption Man was revealed to be the traitor he had been sent to stop. The resurrected and vindicated Myk-El became the consort of the RACCelestial Madonna. After the dust settled a few heroes, like Sig. Lad, left for a new life. And some new heroes, like the Legion of Occult Heroes, joined the LNH.\n\nA brain dead Dr. Killfile was totally obliterated in \"Looniverse Adrift\" and the supervillain Tsar Chasm appeared to die too. Pocket Man married Organic Lass in the first LNH wedding.\n\nIn 1995 in \"Dvandom Force #48\", Sig. Lad was killed by Squidman (formerly the LNHer called Squid Boy) to prevent a dystopian future where he would have killed the entire LNH.\n\nIn 1997 Tsar Chasm returned from the dead and it was revealed that he was posing as the LNHer Kid G. In 1998, Dr. Killfile also returned with no explanation of how he had cheated death in the pages of Teenfactor.\n\nIn 1999 in \"Tales of the LNH #370\", Panta was retconned out of existence, sacrificing herself to save the Looniverse from the Collector.\n\nIn 2000, Hexadecimal Luthor became President of the Loonited States. In 2004, he was re-elected. \n\nIn March 2001, the city of Sig.ago was completely destroyed (it would eventually be restored). \n\nIn July 2001, a number of LNHers were married including Deja Dude, Master Blaster and Sister State the Obvious, Innovative Offense Boy and Ordinary Lady, and Cheesecake Eater Lad and aLLiterative Lass . Since then a few of them have become parents.\n\nIn the 2006 Mid-Term Election, Haiku Gorilla won a seat as Senator for the \"floating\" city of Net.ropolis. \n\nIn 2007, the Ultimate Ninja decided to take a vacation which kicked off Infinite Leadership Crisis, a storyline in LNH Comics Presents written by nine writers. Every day in April, a different member of the LNH became leader and disappeared. There were 465 days in this Infinite April. The conclusion led to the Beige Countdown series, which counted down to the 2008 event Beige Midnight parodying the concept of never ending comic book events.\n\nThe headquarters of the LNH (called LNHHQ or LNHQ) is based in Net.ropolis and houses literally hundreds of members. The ever-expanding and out-of-control roster is one of the key conceits of the Legion. The team does lend itself nicely to several less unwieldy sub-groups.\n\nThe LNH are, for the most part, a privately funded but government-sanctioned team, responding to crises both cosmic and mundane; one sub-group, the \"TSK Force\", is chosen to deal with minor annoyances.\n\nLegionnaires (also known as LNHers or LNH'rs) are given free room and board at LNHQ, plus a small allowance for purchases. How one gains membership into the LNH depends on the author writing the story: many stories feature characters rejected by the Legion who go off to form their own teams; other stories, featuring much less powerful characters, find those characters accepted instantly.\n\nLike physics and aging in the Looniverse as a whole, the features of LNHQ are mutable depending on who is writing the story. A general-use floor-plan is available, and there are a number of features that are generally consistent from interpretation to interpretation:\n\nLNHQ as a building has many unusual properties. For example, its rooms expand to fit the number of people within the room, making for a building that is much larger inside than it appears outside (something akin to a TARDIS.) It possesses a nearly infinite number of sub-basements (each level identified by an additional \"sub\", as in, sub-sub-sub-sub-basement) which are host to a number of ghosts, supernatural creatures, kiwis, and a species of incredibly stupid bird known as the Oozelfinch.\n\nNot only does LNHQ provide living space for its hundreds of members, but it also contains a multitude of ways for them to pass their downtime. The Peril Room is a training room akin to those used by many hero teams, fraught with boobytraps and holographic opponents. One of the unique features of the Peril Room is that, Bugtown-like, one cannot sustain lasting injury within; many stories pit a would-be legionnaire against the Ultimate Ninja in mortal combat: if they last more than a minute before he slices them in twain, then they are granted membership.\n\nThe LNH also has a more general-use holodeck and swimming pool. The Hall of Lost Heroes contains memorials to those who have fallen in battle. The Ultimate Ninja apparently has his own personal garden for meditation and tea, where he also grows his own supply of Ninja bush.\n\nIt has been hinted in some stories that LNHQ is itself sentient.\n\nThe original LNH characters have been designated as \"writer characters\", or \"WCs\". This is because these characters were intended largely as extensions of their authors' personalities; for example, Brian Perler says that he can easily remember useless information, but cannot retain useful facts: thus, he is Obscure Trivia Lad.\n\nAs the stories became more sophisticated, a number of \"non-writer characters\", or \"NWCs\", were created. Many LNH authors still have a character that serves as an author surrogate, but by-and-large the distinction between WCs and NWCs has blurred.\n\nSome characters are owned by their creators or other writers; others are free for use by any writer.\n\nBecause the LNH is so large, to list all of its members in this article would be nearly impossible. What follows are a half-dozen characters whose names and concepts are the most essentially LNH-like.\n\n\nWith the exception of Kid Kirby, all these characters occupy the large pool of characters who can be used freely by any writer, a possible reason for their popularity and the universe's general longevity.\n\nThe LNH is not only a parody universe: over the last fourteen years, it has been expanded upon to include a number of stories, characters, tones, and spin-offs.\n\nAmong the most acclaimed of the LNH canon are:\n\n\n\n\nWith well over a thousand stories posted by over a hundred authors, the LNH is the predominant Usenet-based shared writing universe, and the most active of all the rec.arts.comics.creative universes. In May 1994, the estimated readership of alt.comics.lnh was 45,000. The LNH has had writers from places as diverse as the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, the Philippines, Brazil, Australia, and New Zealand write for it. It is an \"open universe\"—— meaning that anyone can join, providing they abide by basic netiquette and respect the intellectual property of others —— and this openness is probably a key part of its continued life.\n\n"}

It was dug as a defensive fortification, or possibly a boundary marker, between the 5th and 11th centuries.\n\nThe ditch is still visible in short sections, such as a stretch in Denton Golf Course. In the parts which survive, the ditch is wide and up to deep. Part of the earthwork is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument.\n\nThe earliest documented reference to the ditch is in a charter detailing the granting of land in Audenshaw to the monks of the Kersal Cell. In the document, dating from 1190 to 1212, the ditch is referred to as \"Mykelldiche\", and a \"magnum fossatum\", Latin for \"large ditch\".\n\nThe name Nico (sometimes Nikker) for the ditch became established in the 19th and 20th centuries. It may have been derived from the Anglo-Saxon \"Hnickar\", a water spirit who seized and drowned unwary travellers, but the modern name is most likely a corruption of the name Mykelldiche and its variations, as the Anglo-Saxon word \"micel\" meant \"big\" or \"great\", harking back to the early 13th century description of the ditch as \"magnum fossatum\". An alternative derivation is that Nico comes from \"nǽcan\", an Anglo-Saxon verb meaning \"kill\".\n\nNico Ditch stretches between Ashton Moss () in Ashton-under-Lyne and Hough Moss (), just east of Stretford. It passes through Denton, Reddish, Gorton, Levenshulme, Burnage, Rusholme, Platt Fields Park in Fallowfield, Withington and Chorlton-cum-Hardy, crossing four metropolitan boroughs of present-day Greater Manchester. The ditch coincides with the boundaries between the boroughs of Stockport and Manchester, and between Tameside and Manchester as far as Denton golf course. A section is now beneath the Audenshaw Reservoirs, which were built towards the end of the 19th century. The ditch may have extended west beyond Stretford, to Urmston ().\n\nThe earthwork was constructed some time between the end of Roman rule in Britain in the early 5th century and the Norman conquest in 1066. Its original purpose is unclear, but it may have been used as a defensive fortification or as an administrative boundary. It possibly marked a 7th-century boundary for the expansionist Anglo-Saxons, or it may have been a late 8th or early 9th century boundary marker between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. In the early medieval period, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex struggled for control over North West England, along with the Britons and the Danes. Whatever its earlier use, the ditch has been used as a boundary since at least the Middle Ages.\n\nLegend has it that Nico Ditch was completed in a single night by the inhabitants of Manchester, as a protection against Viking invaders in 869–870; Manchester may have been sacked by the Danes in 870. It was said that each man had an allocated area to construct, and was required to dig his section of the ditch and build a bank equal to his own height. According to 19th century folklore, the ditch was the site of a battle between Saxons and Danes; the battle was supposed to have given the nearby towns of Gorton and Reddish their names, from \"Gore Town\" and \"Red-Ditch\", but the idea has been dismissed by historians as a \"popular fancy\". The names derive from \"dirty farmstead\" and \"reedy ditch\" respectively.\n\nAntiquarians and historians have been interested in the ditch since the 19th century, but much of its course has been built over. Between 1990 and 1997, the University of Manchester Archaeological Unit excavated sections of the ditch in Denton, Reddish, Levenshulme and Platt Fields, in an attempt to determine its age and purpose. Although no date was established for the ditch's construction, the investigations revealed that the bank to the north of the ditch is of 20th century origin. Together with the ditch's profile, which is U-shaped rather than the V-shape typically used in military ditches and defences, this suggests that the purpose of the earthwork was to mark a territorial boundary. The conclusion of the project was that the ditch was probably a boundary marker.\n\nDespite heavy weathering, the ditch is still visible in short sections, which can be wide and up to deep. A stretch through Denton Golf Course, and a section running through Platt Fields Park, are considered the best preserved remains. In 1997, a segment of the ditch in Platt Fields was protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The rest of the ditch remains unprotected.\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

{"id": "22570146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22570146", "title": "Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting", "text": "Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting\n\nCarpets of Middle-Eastern origin, either from Anatolia, Persia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, the Levant, the Mamluk state of Egypt or Northern Africa, were used as decorative features in Western European paintings from the 14th century onwards. More depictions of Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting survive than actual carpets produced before the 17th century, though the number of these known has increased in recent decades. Therefore, comparative art-historical research has from its onset in the late 19th century relied on carpets represented in datable European paintings.\n\nActivities of scientists and collectors beginning in the late 19th century have substantially increased the corpus of surviving Oriental carpets, allowing for more detailed comparison of existing carpets with their painted counterparts. Western comparative research resulted in an ever more detailed cultural history of the Oriental art of carpet weaving. This has in turn renewed and inspired the scientific interest in their countries of origin. Comparative research based on Renaissance paintings and carpets preserved in museums and collections continues to contribute to the expanding body of art historical and cultural knowledge.\n\nThe tradition of precise realism among Western painters of the late 15th and 16th century provides pictorial material which is often detailed enough to justify conclusions about even minute details of the painted carpet. The carpets are treated with exceptional care in the rendering of colors, patterns, and details of form and design: The painted texture of a carpet depicted in Petrus Christus's \"Virgin and Child\", the drawing of the individual patterns and motifs, and the way the pile opens where the carpet is folded over the steps, all suggest that the depicted textile is a pile-woven carpet.\n\nVisually, the carpets serve to draw attention either to an important person, or to highlight a location where significant action is going on. In parallel with the development of Renaissance painting, initially mainly Christian saints and religious scenes are set out on the carpets. Later on, the carpets were integrated into secular contexts, but always served to represent the idea of opulence, exoticism, luxury, wealth, or status. First, their use was reserved for the most powerful and most wealthy, for royalty and nobility. Later on, as more people gained sufficient wealth to afford goods of luxury, Oriental carpets appeared on the portraits of merchants and wealthy burghers. During the late 17th and 18th century, the interest in depicting carpets declined. In parallel, the paintings pay less attention to detail.\n\nThe richly designed Oriental carpets appealed strongly to Western painters. The rich and various colours may have influenced the great Venetian painters of the Quattrocento. It has been suggested that the pictorial representation of carpets is linked to the development of the linear perspective, which was first described by Leon Battista Alberti in 1435.\n\nThe depiction of oriental carpets in Renaissance paintings is regarded as an important contribution to a \"world history of art\", based upon interactions of different cultural traditions. Rugs from the Islamic world arrived in large numbers in Western Europe by the 15th century, which is increasingly recognized as a pivotal temporal nexus in the cultural encounters that contributed to the development of Renaissance ideas, arts, and sciences. Intensified contacts, especially the increasing trade between the Islamic world and Western Europe, have provided material sources and cultural influences to Western artists during the next centuries to come. In turn, European market demands also affected the carpet production in their countries of origin.\n\nIn 1871, Julius Lessing published his book on oriental carpet design. He was relying more on European paintings than on the examination of actual carpets for lack of material, because ancient oriental carpets were not yet collected at the time when he worked on his book. Lessing's approach has proven very useful to establish a scientific chronology of Oriental carpet weaving, and was further elaborated and expanded mainly by scholars of the \"Berlin school\" of History of Islamic art: Wilhelm von Bode, and his successors Friedrich Sarre, Ernst Kühnel, and Kurt Erdmann developed the \"ante quem\" method for the dating of oriental carpets based on Renaissance paintings.\n\nThese art historians were also aware of the fact that their scientific approach was biased: Only carpets produced by manufactories were exported to Western Europe, and consequently were available to the Renaissance artists. Village or nomadic rugs did not reach Europe during the Renaissance, and were not depicted in paintings. Not until the mid twentieth century, when collectors like Joseph V. McMullan or James F. Ballard recognized the artistic and art historic value of village or nomadic carpets, were they appreciated in the Western World.\n\nPile carpets with geometric design are known to have been produced from the 13th century among the Seljuks of Rum in eastern Anatolia, whom Venice had had commercial relations since 1220. The Medieval trader and traveler Marco Polo himself mentioned that the carpets produced at Konya were the best in the world:\n\"...et ibi fiunt soriani et tapeti pulchriores de mundo et pulchrioris coloris.\"<br>\n\"...and here they make the most beautiful silks and carpets in the world, and with the most beautiful colours.\"\nCarpets were also produced in Islamic Spain, and one is shown in a fresco of the 1340s in the Palais des Papes, Avignon. The vast majority of carpets in 15th- and 16th-century paintings are either from the Ottoman Empire, or possibly European copies of these types from the Balkans, Spain, or elsewhere. In fact these were not the finest Islamic carpets of the period, and few of the top-quality Turkish \"court\" carpets are seen. Even finer than these, Persian carpets do not appear until the end of the 16th century, but become increasingly popular among the very wealthy in the 17th century. The very refined Mamluk carpets from Egypt are occasionally seen, mostly in Venetian paintings.\n\nOne of the first uses of an oriental carpet in a European painting is Simone Martini's \"Saint Louis of Toulouse Crowning Robert of Anjou, King of Naples\", painted in 1316-1319. Another Anatolian animal carpet appears in a c. 1340-45 Sienese panel of the Holy Family attributed to Pietro or Ambrogio Lorenzetti (Abegg-Stiftung, Riggisberg) with alternating black and white animals within colorful octagonal medallions. European depictions of Oriental carpets were extremely faithful to the originals, judging by comparison with the few surviving examples of actual rugs of contemporary date. Their larger scale also allows more detailed and accurate depictions than those shown in miniature paintings from Turkey or Persia.\n\nMost carpets use Islamic geometric designs, with the earliest ones also using animal patterns such as the originally Chinese-inspired \"phoenix-and-dragon\", as in Domenico di Bartolo's \"\" (1440). These had been stylised and simplified into near-geometric motifs in their transmission to the Islamic world. The whole group, referred to in the literature as \"Animal rugs\" disappeared from paintings by about the end of the 15th century. Only a handful of original animal-pattern carpets survive, two from European churches, where their rarity presumably preserved them. The \"Marby Rug\", one of the finest examples, was preserved in a church of the Swedish town of Marby, and a bold adaptation of an originally Chinese \"dragon and phoenix\" motif is in Berlin. Both are rugs, less than 2 metres long, and about 1 metre wide, with two compartments, though the Berlin carpet lacks a border down one long side. The \"Dragon and Phoenix\" and the \"Marby\" rugs were the only existing examples of Animal carpets known until 1988. Since then, seven more carpets of this type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the Chinese cultural revolution. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art which parallels a painting by the Sienese artist Gregorio di Cecco: \"The Marriage of the Virgin\", 1423. It shows large confronted animals, each with a smaller animal inside.\n\nAlthough the carpets were displayed on a public floor in a few examples, most carpets on the floor are in an area reserved for the main protagonists, very often on a dais or in front of an altar, or down steps in front of the Virgin Mary or Saints, or rulers, in the manner of a modern red carpet. This presumably reflected the contemporary practice of royalty; in Denmark the 16th century Persian Coronation Carpet is used under the throne for coronations to this day. They are also often hung over balustrades or out of windows for festive occasions, such as the processions through Venice shown by Vittore Carpaccio or Gentile Bellini (see gallery); when Carpaccio's St Ursula embarks they are hung over the sides of boats and footbridges.\n\nOriental carpets were often depicted as a decorative element in religious scenes, and were a symbol of luxury, status and taste, although they were becoming more widely available throughout the period, which is reflected in the paintings. In some cases, such as paintings by Gentile Bellini, the carpets reflect an early Orientalist interest, but for most painters they merely reflect the prestige of the carpets in Europe. A typical example is the Turkish carpet at the feet of the Virgin Mary in the 1456-1459 San Zeno Altarpiece by Andrea Mantegna ().\n\nNon-royal portrait sitters were more likely to place their carpet on a table or other piece of furniture, especially in Northern Europe, though small rugs beside a bed are not uncommon, as in the \"Arnolfini Portrait\" of 1434. Carpets are seen on tables in particular in Italian scenes showing the \"Calling of Matthew\", when he was engaged in his work as a tax-collector, and the life of Saint Eligius, who was a goldsmith. Both are shown sitting doing business at a carpet-covered table or shop counter.\nThe Oriental carpets used in Renaissance painting had various geographical origins, designated in contemporary Italy by different names: the \"cagiarini\" (Mamluk design from Egypt), the \"damaschini\" (Damascus region), the \"barbareschi\" (North Africa), the \"rhodioti\" (probably imported through Rome), the \"turcheschi\" (Ottoman Empire) and the \"simiscasa\" (Circassian or Caucasian).\n\nSome of the prayer carpets represented in Christian religious paintings are also Islamic prayer mats, with such motifs as the mihrab or the Kaaba (the so-called re-entrant carpets, later called the \"Bellini\" type). The representation of such prayer rugs disappeared after 1555, probably as a consequence of the realization of their religious meaning and connection to Islam.\n\nThe depiction of Oriental carpets in paintings other than portraits generally declined after the 1540s, corresponding to a decline in the taste for highly detailed representation of objects (Detailism) among painters, and grander classicising surrounds for hieratic religious images.\n\nWhen Western scholars explored the history of Islamic carpetmaking, several types of carpet pattern became conventionally called after the names of European painters who had used them, and these terms remain in use. The classification is mostly that of Kurt Erdmann, once Director of the Museum für Islamische Kunst (Berlin), and the leading carpet scholar of his day. Some of these types ceased to be produced several centuries ago, and the location of their production remains uncertain, so obvious alternative terms were not available. The classification ignores the border patterns, and distinguishes between the type, size and arrangement of gul, or larger motifs in the central field of the carpet. In addition to four types of Holbein carpets, there are Bellini carpets, Crivellis, Memlings, and Lotto carpets. These names are somewhat random: many artists painted these types, and single artists often painted many types of carpets.\n\nBoth Giovanni Bellini and his brother Gentile (who visited Istanbul in 1479) painted examples of these prayer-rugs with a single \"re-entrant\" or keyhole motif at the bottom of a larger figure traced in a thin border. At the top end the borders close diagonally to a point, from which hangs down a \"lamp\". The design had Islamic significance, and its function seems to have been recognised in Europe, as they were known in English as \"musket\" carpets, a corruption of \"mosque\".\nIn the Gentile Bellini seen at top the rug is the \"right\" way round; often this is not the case. Later Ushak prayer-rugs where both ends have the diagonal pointed inner border, as at the top only of Bellini rugs, are sometimes known as Tintoretto rugs, though this term is not as commonly used as the others mentioned here.\n\nCarlo Crivelli twice painted what seems to be the same small rug, with the centre taken up with a complex sixteen-pointed star motif made up of several compartments in different colours, some containing highly stylised animal motifs. Comparable actual carpets are extremely rare, but there are two in Budapest. The \"Annunciation\" of 1482 in the Städel museum in Frankfurt shows it at the top, and the same carpet seems to be used in the \"Annunciation, with Saint Emidius\" in the National Gallery, London (1486), which shows the type hung over a balcony to the top left, and a different type of carpet over another balcony in the right foreground. These seem to be a transitional type between the early animal-pattern carpets and later purely geometrical designs, such as the Holbein types, perhaps reflecting increased Ottoman enforcement of Islamic aniconism.\n\nThese are named after Hans Memling, who painted several examples of what may have been Armenian carpets in the last quarter of the fifteenth century, and are characterised by several lines coming off the motifs that end in \"hooks\", by coiling in on themselves through two or three 90° turns. Another example appears in a miniature painted for René of Anjou about 1460.\n\nThese in fact are seen in paintings from many decades earlier than Holbein, and are sub-divided into four types (of which Holbein actually only painted two); they are the commonest designs of Anatolian carpet seen in Western Renaissance paintings, and continued to be produced for a long period. All are purely geometric and use a variety of arrangements of lozenges, crosses and octagonal motifs within the main field. The sub-divisions are between:\n\n\nThese were previously known as \"small-pattern Holbein Type II\", but he never painted one, unlike Lorenzo Lotto, who did so several times, though he was not the first artist to show them. Lotto is also documented as owning a large carpet, though its pattern is unknown. They were primarily produced during the 16th and 17th centuries along the Aegean coast of Anatolia, Turkey, but also copied in various parts of Europe, including Spain, England and Italy. They are characterized by a lacy arabesque, usually in yellow on a red ground, often with blue details.\n\nThough they look very different from Holbein Type I carpets, they are a development of the type, where the edges of the motifs, nearly always in yellow on a red ground, take off in rigid arabesques somewhat suggesting foliage, and terminating in branched palmettes. The type was common and long-lasting, and is also known as \"Arabesque Ushak\".\n\nTo judge from paintings, they reached Italy by 1516, Portugal about a decade later, and reached northern Europe, including England, by the 1560s. They continue to appear in paintings until about the 1660s, especially in the Netherlands.\nA carpet closely related to the 1483 painting by Domenico Ghirlandaio was found by A. Boralevi in the Evangelical church, Hâlchiu (Heldsdorf) in Transylvania, attributed to Western Anatolia, and dated to the late 15th century.\n\nThe general design of the Ghirlandaio type, as in the 1486 painting, is related to Holbein Type 1. It is defined by one or two central medallions of diamond shape, consisting of an octagon within a square, from whose sides triangular, curvilinear patterns arise. Carpets with this medallion have been woven in the Western Anatolian region of Çanakkale since the 16th century. A carpet fragment with a Ghirlandaio medallion was found in the Divriği Great Mosque, and dated to the 16th century. Carpets with similar medallions were dated to the 17th, 18th and 19th<ref name=\"Zipper/Fritsche 1995\"></ref> century, respectively, and are still woven in the Çanakkale region today.\n\nIn his essay on \"Centralized Designs\", Thompson relates the central medallion pattern of oriental carpets to the \"lotus pedestal\" and \"cloud collar (yun chien)\" motifs, used in the art of Buddhist Asia. The origin of the design thus dates back to pre-Islamic times, probably Yuan time China. Brüggemann and Boehmer further elaborate that it might have been introduced to Western Anatolia by the Seljuk, or Mongol invaders in the 11th or 13th century.<ref name=\"Brüggemann/Boehmer\"></ref> In contrast to the manifold variation of patterns seen in other carpet types, the Ghirlandaio medallion design has remained largely unaltered from the 15th to the 21st century, and thus exemplifies an unusual continuity of a woven carpet design within a specific region.\n\nThe Netherlandish painters Jan van Eyck, in his \"Paele Madonna\", 'Lucca Madonna\", and the Dresden Triptych, and Petrus Christus in his \"Virgin and Child with Saints Jerome and Francis\" have painted four different carpets, three of them of a similar design. By the realism of the depictions, these are pile-woven carpets. No directly comparable carpets have survived.\n\nThe carpet pattern depicted on Jan van Eyck's \"Paele Madonna\" could be traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of Khirbat al-Mafjar.\n\nSimilar, but not identical carpets appear in the \"Lucca Madonna\", Dresden triptych, and \"Virgin with Child and Saints\" paintings which show a predominantly geometric design with a lozenge composition in infinite repeat, built up from fine bands which connect eight-pointed stars. Yetkin has identified an Anatolian carpet with a similar, but more advanced lozenge design (Yetkin, 1981, plate 47 in the Mevlana Museum, Konya, dated to the 17th century. She relates these carpets to 19th century Caucasian \"Dragon\" rugs with a similar lozenge design (p. 71), and claims that carpets of a type as depicted by van Eyck and Petrus Christus are early Anatolian forerunners to the later Caucasian design.\n\nThe main borders of the carpets in the \"Paele\" and \"Lucca Madonna\", as well as in \"Virgin with Child and Saints\" however, each show a non-Oriental undulating trefoil stem. Similar ornaments can be found in the borders of many carpets in Netherlandish paintings from the 15th to the beginning of the 16th century. The fringes of these carpets are often found at the sides of the painted carpets, not at the upper and lower ends. Either did the carpets have an uncommonly square shape, or maybe the artists have used some license and improvised with the authentic models. Alternatively, the carpets depicted by van Eyck and Petrus Christus could be of Western European manufacture. The undulating trefoil (clover) design is a well-known feature of Western Gothic ornament.\n\nFrom the middle of the 15th century onwards, a type of carpet was produced in Egypt which is characterized by a dominant central medallion, or three to five medallions in a row along the vertical axis. Numerous smaller ornaments are placed around the medallions, such as eight-pointed stars, or small ornaments composed of stylized floral elements. The innumerable small geometric and floral ornaments give a kaleidoscopic impression. Sixty of these carpets were given to the English cardinal Thomas Wolsey in exchange for a license for Venetian merchants to import wine to England. The earliest known painting representing a Mamluk carpet is Giovanni Bellinis \"Portrait of the Doge of Venice Loredan and his four advisers\" from 1507. A French master depicted \"The Three De Coligny brothers\" in 1555. Another representation can be found on Ambrosius Frankens \"The Last Supper\", about 1570. The large medallion is depicted in a way that it forms the nimbus of the head of Christ. The characteristic mamluk carpet ornaments are clearly visible. Ydema has documented a total of 16 dateable representations of Mamluk carpets.\n\nAfter the 1517 Ottoman conquest of the Mamluk Sultanate in Egypt, two different cultures merged, as is seen on Mamluk carpets woven after this date. After the conquest, the Cairene weavers adopted an Ottoman Turkish design. The production of these carpets continued in Egypt into the early 17th century. A carpet of the Ottoman Cairene type is depicted in Ludovicus Finsonius' painting \"The Annunciation\". Its border design and guard borders are the same as a carpet in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. A similar carpet has been depicted by Adriaen van der Venne in \"Geckie met de Kous\", 1630. Peter Paul Rubens and Jan Brueghel the Elders \"Christ in the House of Mary and Martha\", 1628, shows the characteristic S-stems ending in double sickle-shaped lancet leaves. Various carpets of the Ottoman Cairene type are depicted in Moretto da Brescias frescoes in the \"Sala delle Dame\" at the Palazzo Salvadego in Brescia, Italy.\n\nAn extremely rare group of carpets, \"chequerboard\" carpets were assumed to be a later and derivative continuum of the Mamluk and Ottoman Cairene group of carpets. Only about 30 of these carpets survived. They are distinguished by their design composed of rows of squares with triangles in each corner enclosing a star pattern. All \"chequerboard\" carpets have borders with cartouches and lobed medallions. Their attribution is still under debate. The colours and patterns resemble those seen in Mamluk carpets, however, they are \"S-spun\" and \"Z-twisted\" and thus similar to early anatolian and caucasian carpets. Since the early days of carpet science they are attributed to Damascus. Pinner and Franses champion this attribution because Syria was part first of the Mamluk, later of the Ottoman Empire at that time. This would explain the similarities with the colours and patterns of the Cairene carpets. The current dating of the chequerboard carpets is also consistent with European collection inventories from the early 17th century. Carpets of the \"chequerboard\" type are depicted on Pietro Paolinis (1603−1681) \"\"Self portrait\", as well as on Gabriël Metsus painting \"The musical party\"\".\n\nIn contrast to the relatively large number of surviving carpets of this type, relatively few of them are represented in Renaissance paintings.\n\nStar Ushak carpets were often woven in large formats. As such, they represent a typical product of higher organized, town manufacture. They are characterized by large dark blue star shaped primary medallions in infinite repeat on a red ground field containing a secondary floral scroll. The design was likely influenced by northwest Persian book design, or by Persian carpet medallions. As compared to the medallion Ushak carpets, the concept of the infinite repeat in star Ushak carpets is more accentuated and in keeping with the early Turkish design tradition. Because of their strong allusion to the inifinite repeat, the star Ushak design can be used on carpets of various size and in many varying dimensions.\n\nMedallion Ushak carpets usually have a red or blue field decorated with a floral trellis or leaf tendrils, ovoid primary medallions alternating with smaller eight-lobed stars, or lobed medallions, intertwined with floral tracery. Their border frequently contains palmettes on a floral and leaf scroll, and pseudo-kufic characters.\n\nThe best known representation of a Medallion Ushak was painted in 1656 by Vermeer in his painting \"The Procuress\". It is placed horizontally; the upper or lower end with the star-shaped corner medallion can be seen. Under the woman's hand which holds the glass, a part of a characteristic Ushak medallion can be seen. The carpet seen on Vermeer's \"Music lesson\", \"Girl reading a letter at an open window\", and \"The Concert\" hardly show any differences in the details of the design or the weaving structure indicate that all three pictures might trace back to one single carpet Vermeer might have had at his studio. The painings by Vermeer, Steen, and Verkolje depict a special type of Ushak carpet of which no surviving counterpart is known. It is characterized by its rather sombre colours, coarse weaving, and patterns with a more degenerated curvilinear design.\n\nCarpets remained an important way of enlivening the background of full-length portraits throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, for example in the English portraits of William Larkin.\n\nThe finely-knotted silk carpets woven in the time of Shah Abbas I at Kashan and Isfahan are rarely represented in paintings, as they were doubtless very unusual in European homes; however, \"A Lady playing the Theorbo\". by Gerard Terborch (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 14.40.617) shows such a carpet laid upon the table on which the lady's cavalier is sitting. Floral \"Isfahan\" carpets of the Herat type, on the other hand, were exported in great numbers to Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands, and are often represented in interiors painted by Velásquez, Rubens, Van Dyck, Vermeer, Terborch, de Hooch, Bol and Metsu, where the dates established for the paintings provide a yardstick for establishing the chronology of the designs.\n\nAnthony van Dyck's royal and aristocratic subjects had mostly progressed to Persian carpets, but less wealthy sitters are still shown with the Turkish types. The 1620 \"Portrait of Abraham Graphaeus\" by Cornelis de Vos, and Thomas de Keysers \"Portrait of an unknown man\" (1626) and \"Portrait of Constantijn Huyghens and his clerk\" (1627) are amongst the earliest paintings depicting a new type of Ottoman Turkish manufactory carpet, which was exported to Europe in large quantities, probably in order to meet the increasing demand. A large number of similar carpets were preserved in Transylvania, which was an important center of Turkish carpet trade during the 15th–17th century. Hence carpets of this type are known by a term of convenience as \"Transylvanian carpets\". Pieter de Hoochs 1663 painting \"Portrait of a family making music\" depicts an Ottoman prayer rug of the \"Transylvanian\" type. In the American colonies Isaac Royall and his family were painted by Robert Feke in 1741, posed round a table spread with a Bergama rug.\n\nFrom the mid-century European direct trade with India brought Mughal versions of Persian patterns to Europe. Painters of the Dutch Golden Age showed their skill by depiction of light effects on table-carpets, like Vermeer in his \"Music Lesson\" (Royal Collection). By this date they have become common in the homes of the reasonably well-to-do, as is shown by historical documentation of inventories. Carpets are sometimes depicted in scenes of debauchery from the prosperous Netherlands.\n\nBy the end of the century Oriental carpets had lost much of their status as prestige objects, and the grandest sitters for portraits were more likely to be shown on the high-quality Western carpets, like Savonneries, now being produced, whose less intricate patterns were also easier to depict in a painterly manner. A number of Orientalist European painters continued to accurately depict Oriental carpets, now usually in Oriental settings.\n\nThe perception of Oriental carpets during the Renaissance is characterized by three main aspects: \nIn any case, Oriental carpets were used in Western Europe in different ways and contexts than in the Islamic world, and their original cultural context was never fully understood.\n\nOriental carpets appear for the first time on early Renaissance paintings of the late 12th century. In most cases the carpets serve as a background for religious scenes. Saints were depicted enthroned or standing on carpets, thus being elated, and separated from their surroundings.\nOrdinary people, often the donors of the painting, were sometimes allowed to participate in the atmosphere of holiness by depicting them near the holy person, or literally kneeling or standing \"on the same carpet\" as the saint. This context is still understood and at times used today.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the religious context has been proposed by V. Gantzhorn in 1998: He compared in detail the patterns and symbols of both the Renaissance paintings and surviving carpets with ancient ornaments, for example with Armenian illuminated manuscripts. He concluded that the majority of the surviving and painted carpets alike were produced by Christian Armenian weavers. The hidden Christian symbolism of the carpet patterns had therefore made the so-called \"Christian oriental carpets\" appropriate adornments for Western European Christian churches. Following this hypothesis, the lack of contemporary Western European written sources, which could otherwise provide independent evidence to support Gantzhorns claims, is explained by the fact that the knowledge of the hidden symbols was subject to oral tradition, and restricted to a small religious élite. The Armenian Genocide had led to the loss of the oral tradition, and, subsequently, to an incorrect \"Islamic\" attribution of the carpets by the majority of Western art historians. The debate about Gantzhorns hypotheses, which is at times conducted polemically and not entirely free of nationalistic constraints, is still ongoing.\n\nWe do not understand exactly how Renaissance artists thought about the Oriental carpets they were depicting. We know that the Venetian Piazza San Marco was adorned with carpets hanging from the windows of the surrounding palaces and houses on special occasions. Like the beautiful ladies looking out of the windows, the carpets function as a decorative framework, and highlight the important action which is going on. Similar to the inaccurate pseudo-kufic writing in contemporary paintings, the European artists borrowed something from another culture which they, essentially, did not understand.\n\nIn a series of letters from Venice dated 18 August - 13 October 1506, the German painter Albrecht Dürer tells his friend Willibald Pirckheimer about his efforts to buy two carpets for him in Venice:\n\nDürer was buying various exotic luxury goods for Pirckheimer in Venice, and he mentions the two carpets amongst gold, jewels, or crane feathers. We do not know if Dürer in any way attributed artistic value to these carpets. No oriental carpets were ever depicted by Dürer.\n\nA very common type of genre painting of the Dutch Golden Age and Flemish Baroque, the so-called Merry Company type of painting, depicts a group of people enjoying themselves, usually seated with drinks, and often music-making. In these pictures, Oriental carpets often cover and decorate the table, or are spread over the furniture. As such, they either underline the wealth and respectability of the portrayed, or add a context of exoticism and profligacy to brothel scenes, or scenes of debauchery.\n\nBy the 16th century, Oriental carpets were often depicted in still life paintings. Assorted valuable, exotic objects like Chinese porcelain bowls and animals like parrots are depicted, often with an allegorical meaning, or symbolizing \"vanitas\", the futility of human life. The allusion to futility is made apparent by the inclusion of symbols like a human skull, or inscriptions quoting the biblical book of Ecclesiastes . As early as 1533, Hans Holbein's painting \"The Ambassadors\" prominently shows an anamorphic projection of a human skull. Objects in still lifes, regardless of their allegorical meaning, are often placed on precious velvet table cloths, marble plates, or oriental carpets. As such, Oriental carpets are treated similar to other precious objects or materials, the focus being on their material value and decorative effect.\nIn September 1479 the Venetian painter Gentile Bellini was sent by the Venetian Senate as a cultural ambassador to Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror's new Ottoman capital Constantinople as part of the peace settlement between Venice and the Turks. Vasari wrote that Bellini \"portrayed the Emperor Mahomet from the life so well, that it was held a miracle\". The dating and authorship of the portrait by Bellini have been placed in question, however, Bellini is the first great Renaissance painter who actually visited an Islamic Sultan's court.\n\nThe influence of Bellinis encounter with the Islamic world is reflected by Oriental motifs appearing in several of his paintings. His 1507 \"St. Mark Preaching at Alexandria\" anachronistically shows the patron saint of Venice preaching to Muslims. The architecture shown in the background is an incongruous assortment of buildings, not corresponding to contemporary Islamic architecture. The stage-like setting for St Mark's sermon is adorned by exotic animals like a camel and a giraffe, as well as architectural elements like an ancient Egyptian obelisk, in the background. Bellini's use of these decorative elements resembles the way Oriental carpets are depicted in 14th and 15th century Renaissance paintings: They are depictions of the exotic and the precious, they set a stage for an important person or action, but, as yet, essentially ignore their original cultural context.\n\nThe 1547 depiction of King Edward VI of England standing on an Oriental carpet, in front of a throne on the same carpet asserts the young Fidei defensor's strength and power, by a deliberate echo of the pose of his father's famous portrait by Holbein.\n\nNothing is known about how much Ambrosius Francken knew about the cultural background of the Mamluk carpet which he used as a decoration for his \"Last Supper\". The painting can only be roughly dated to the 16th century. The use of the central medallion of an Oriental carpet to highlight the nimbus of Christ, however, represents a special case: The use of the motif could either have resulted from a mere similarity of the two pictorial patterns, but it can also be understood as an assertion of Renaissance Christian predominance. Europeans had reasons to fear the Islamic world: In 1529, Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna, and the Ottoman Empire remained a constant threat to Western Europe until the late 17th century.\n\nIn his 1502–9 cycle of the Piccolomini library frescoes at the Dome of Siena, Pinturicchio depicts Pope Pius II convoking, as the Latin inscription explains, a Diet of Princes at Mantua to proclaim a new crusade in 1459. On the eighth fresco, a table in front of the Pope's throne is covered by an Oriental carpet. It was hypothesized that the carpet might have been a trophy from previous expeditions.\n\nPrecious Oriental carpets were part of the so-called \"\" (lit.: \"Turkish loot\") from the siege of Vienna which ended on 12 September 1683 and their new Christian owners proudly reported back home about their plunder. Carpets exist with inscriptions indicating the new owner, and the date when it was acquired:\n\nThe majority of Oriental carpets, however, continue to be depicted as objects with visual appeal, without political connotations, but ignoring their original cultural context. It was reserved to a later century to try and reach out for a better understanding of the carpets within their Islamic cultural context. Whilst Islamic carpets initially served to adorn Renaissance paintings, later on the paintings contributed to a better understanding of the carpets. Comparative art historical research on Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting thus adds another facette, and leads to a better understanding of the highly multifaceted, and sometimes ambivalent, image of the Ottomans during the Western European Renaissance.\n\n\n\n"}

The American constitution is often pointed to as support for the belief, ensuring for all peoples under its administration such maxims as free speech.\n\nCritics of this philosophy argue that the general public (and, on a more individual basis, the \"Average Joe\") lacks the resources and capability to conceive opinions that are educated enough to be taken seriously. Thus, the abundance and fervent promotion of such opinions merely confuses and complicates political matters that, given an appropriate amount of factual education, are either easily understood or should be discussed only by those with sufficient intelligence to do the matter justice.\n\nThere are many methods used throughout history of promoting political opinions and with the development of new technologies new ways have materialized both in recent and ancient history. Some of the most common include the following:\n\nThroughout history one of the most influential methods (arguably the most influential method) of promoting political opinions has been literary. This peculiar pattern of books influencing the thinking of the masses, reinstated with such books as the Bible, Uncle Tom's Cabin, the Qur'an, \"The Diary of a Young Girl\", \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" and many others, has been attributed to many of the characteristics of writing. While it has been proven that a well-written book can indeed appeal to one's intellect with reasoning and ideas sprung from common sense, the drive of literature and writing is most commonly considered to be derivative of the emotional impact of the text, guiding people to think a certain way by making them feel a certain way. This often has great political consequences, most particularly when the subject of the emotional reaction is a plea for moral justice, as can be seen (to use America as an example once more) in the aftermath of the publication of Uncle Tom's Cabin concerning American views about slavery. It is from this correlation between books and politics that the phrase, \"the pen is mightier than the sword\", derives.\n\nSince their development in this past century, both television and films have often had far-reaching political effects throughout the world. Influential films and television events include Countdown with Keith Olbermann, Citizen Kane, the works of Walt Disney, and such political satire as that found in The Simpsons. Like literature (see above), a movie or television event has the capacity to have emotional impact on its viewers, making it an invaluable tool for politics. This attribute is noticed and used frequently by politicians and ordinary citizens alike; political propaganda on the screen now has an effect on everything from a nation's outlook on its economy to the smallest of elections and political decisions.\n\nPolitical cartoons (also known as \"editorial cartoons\") are infamous for their ability to promote political views through satirical means. With cartoons the fight for the minds of the public is not a verbal but a visual one and leaving strong impressions with the use of powerful symbols or metaphors in order to communicate the artist's messages.\n\nSince many people know only a very little about their civilization and its present state except for what is told to them by the media, the potential for influence is extremely high with the publication of newspapers, news broadcasts, etc. Any bias in these mediums alters people's impressions of current events into different understandings and opinions than those that may have been chosen with more accurate information.\n\nWith the recent invention of the Internet, political criticism has been greatly extended to anyone with a connection to the World Wide Web. In a few decades already this has revolutionized politics to the extent that the public now has a virtually unlimited education quite literally at its fingertips, allowing people to choose with less work what aspects of current politics they wish to research.\n\nThe many means of exchanging ideas, including blogs and internet forums, has extended the political debate to anyone that cares to contribute. This ability and speed that which ideas can flow has literally changed the way that political parties stay connected to constituents.\n\n"}

Around 1928, Roso de Luna and his group founded the initiatic philosophical school \"Schola Philosophicae Initiationis\" (SPI) that was \"a reaction against the instability and indiscipline of the Theosophical Society.\" The declared objectives of the SPI were \"the comparative study of the philosophies, sciences and arts in their mutual relations, and promoting the health and culture of its members as well as their moral progress\".\n\nThe new School bought a property in Manzanares el Real in the Community of Madrid to build a center for advanced philosophical studies called \"The House of the Philosopher\".

It operated under this title from February until May 2003, before being renamed as the Terrorism Information Awareness.\n\nBased on the concept of predictive policing, TIA aimed to gather detailed information about individuals in order to anticipate and prevent crimes before they are committed. As part of efforts to win the War on Terror, the program searched for all sorts of personal information in the hunt for terrorists around the globe. Admiral John Poindexter referred to it as a \"Manhattan Project for Counter-Terrorism\". According to Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), TIA was the \"biggest surveillance program in the history of the United States\".\n\nThe program was defunded alongside the Information Awareness Office in late 2003 by the United States Congress after media reports criticized the government for attempting to establish \"Total Information Awareness\" over all citizens.\n\nAlthough the program was formally suspended, its data mining software was later adopted by other government agencies, with only superficial changes being made. The core architecture of TIA continued development under the code name \"Basketball.\" According to a 2012 \"New York Times\" article, the legacy of Total Information Awareness is \"quietly thriving\" at the National Security Agency (NSA).\n\nTotal Information Awareness (TIA) was intended to be a five year long research project by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The goal was to integrate components from previous and brand new government intelligence and surveillance programs, including Genoa, Genoa II, Genisys, SSNA, EELD, WAE, TIDES, Communicator, HumanID and Bio-Surveillance with data mining knowledge gleamed from the private sector to create a resource for the intelligence, counterintelligence, and law enforcement communities. These components consisted of information analysis, collaboration, decision-support tools, language translation, data-searching, pattern recognition, and privacy-protection technologies.\n\nTIA research included or planned to include the participation of nine government entities: INSCOM, NSA, DIA, CIA, CIFA, STRATCOM, SOCOM, JFCOM, JWAC. These agencies were to be able to access TIA's programs through a series of dedicated nodes. TIA's hardware was to be housed by INSCOM in Fort Belvoir, Virginia.\nCompanies that were contracted to work on TIA included the Science Applications International Corporation, Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Schafer Corporation, SRS Technologies, Adroit Systems, CACI Dynamic Systems, ASI Systems International, and Syntek Technologies.\n\nUniversities enlisted to assist with research and development included Berkeley, Colorado State, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Cornell, Dallas, GeorgiaTech, Maryland, MIT, and Southampton.\n\nThe goal of the Total Information Awareness program was to revolutionize the ability of the United States to detect, classify and identify foreign terrorists – and decipher their plans – and thereby enable the U.S. to take timely action to successfully preempt and defeat terrorist acts.\n\nTo that end, the TIA program objective was to create a counter-terrorism information system that:\n\n1. Increases information coverage by an order of magnitude, and affords easy future scaling\n\n2. Provides focused warnings within an hour after a triggering event occurs or an evidence threshold is passed\n\n3. Automatically queues analysts based on partial pattern matches and has patterns that cover 90% of all previously known foreign terrorist attacks\n\n4. Supports collaboration, analytical reasoning and information sharing so that analysts can hypothesize, test and propose theories and mitigating strategies about possible futures, so decision-makers can effectively evaluate the impact of current or future policies and prospective courses of action.\n\nUnlike the other program components, Genoa predated Total Information Awareness and provided a basis for it. Genoa's primary function was intelligence analysis in order to assist human analysts. The program was designed to support both top-down and bottom-up approaches; a policy maker could hypothesize a possible attack and use Genoa to look for supporting evidence of such a plot, or it would compile pieces of intelligence into a diagram and suggest possible outcomes. Human analysts would then be able to modify the diagram to test various cases.\n\nGenoa, which had been independently commissioned in 1996, was completed in 2002 as scheduled.\n\nWhile Genoa primarily focused on intelligence analyses, Genoa II was aimed towards providing means with which computers, software agents, policy makers, and field operatives could collaborate.\n\nGenisys aimed at developing technologies which would enable \"ultra-large, all-source information repositories\".\n\nVast amounts of information were going to be collected and analyzed, and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data. So they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation in order to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases, as well as unstructured public data sources, such as the World Wide Web. \"Effective analysis across heterogenous databases\" means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of data—such as a database containing criminal records, a phone call database and a foreign intelligence database. The World Wide Web is considered an \"unstructured public data source\" because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data—such as blogs, emails, records of visits to web sites, etc.—all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently.\n\nAnother goal was to develop \"a large, distributed system architecture for managing the huge volume of raw data input, analysis results, and feedback, that will result in a simpler, more flexible data store that performs well and allows us to retain important data indefinitely.\"\n\nScalable Social Network Analysis (SSNA) aimed at developing techniques based on social network analysis for modeling the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminating these groups from other types of societal groups.\n\nEvidence Extraction and Link Discovery (EELD) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery, extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources (such as phone call records from the NSA call database, internet histories, or bank records).\n\nEELD was designed to design systems with the ability to extract data from multiple sources (e.g., text messages, social networking sites, financial records, and web pages). It was to develop the ability to detect patterns comprising multiple types of links between data items or people communicating (e.g., financial transactions, communications, travel, etc.).\n\nIt is designed to link items relating potential \"terrorist\" groups and scenarios, and to learn patterns of different groups or scenarios to identify new organizations and emerging threats.\n\nWargaming the Asymmetric Environment (WAE) focused on developing automated technology capable of identifying predictive indicators of terrorist activity or impending attacks by examining individual and group behavior in broad environmental context and examining the motivation of specific terrorists.\n\nTranslingual Information Detection, Extraction and Summarization (TIDES) developing advanced language processing technology to enable English speakers to find and interpret critical information in multiple languages without requiring knowledge of those languages.\n\nOutside groups (such as universities, corporations, etc.) were invited to participate in the annual information retrieval, topic detection and tracking, automatic content extraction, and machine translation evaluations run by NIST. Cornell University, Columbia University, and the University of California, Berkeley were given grants to work on TIDES.\n\nCommunicator was to develop \"dialogue interaction\" technology that enabled warfighters to talk with computers, such that information would be accessible on the battlefield or in command centers without ever using a keyboard-based interface . The Communicator Platform was to be both wireless and mobile, and to be designed to function in a networked environment.\n\nThe dialogue interaction software was to interpret the context of the dialogue in order to improve performance, and to be capable of automatically adapting to new topics so conversation could be natural and efficient. The Communicator program emphasized task knowledge to compensate for natural language effects and noisy environments. Unlike automated translation of natural language speech, which is much more complex due to an essentially unlimited vocabulary and grammar, the Communicator program is directed task specific issues so that there are constrained vocabularies (the system only needs to be able to understand language related to war). Research was also started to focus on foreign language computer interaction for use in supporting coalition operations.\n\nLive exercises were conducted involving small unit logistics operations with the United States Marines to test the technology in extreme environments.\n\nThe Human Identification at a Distance (HumanID) project developed automated biometric identification technologies to detect, recognize and identify humans at great distances for \"force protection\", crime prevention, and \"homeland security/defense\" purposes.\n\nThe goals of HumanID were to:\n\nA number of universities were included to assist in designing certain areas of HumanID. The Georgia Institute of Technology's College of Computing focused on gait recognition. Gait recognition was key component of HumanID, because it could be employed on low-resolution video feeds and therefore help to identify subjects at a distance. They planned on developing a system that recovered static body and stride parameters of subjects as they walked, while also looking into the ability of time-normalized joint angle trajectories in the walking plane as a means of recognizing gait. The university also did related work in locating and tracking faces with expressions and speech.\n\nCarnegie Mellon University's Robotics Institute (part of the School of Computer Science) worked on dynamic face recognition. The research focused primarily the extraction of body biometric features from video and identifying subjects from the extracted body biometric features. To conduct its studies, the university created databases of synchronized multi-camera video sequences of body motion, human faces under a wide range of imaging conditions, AU coded expression videos, and hyperspectal and polarimetric images of human faces. The video sequences of body motion data consisted of six separate viewpoints of 25 subjects walking on a treadmill. Four separate 11-second gaits were tested for each: slow walk, fast walk, inclined, and carrying a ball.\n\nThe University of Maryland's Institute for Advanced Computer Studies' research focused on the recognition of an individual at a distance through gait and face information. Also to be utilized were infrared and 5-degree-of-freedom cameras. Test conducted included filming 38 male and 6 female subjects of different ethnicity and physical features walking along a T-shaped path from various angles.\n\nThe University of Southampton's Department of Electronics and Computer Science was developing an \"Automatic Gait Recognition\" system and was in charge of compiling a database to test it. The University of Texas at Dallas was compiling a database to test facial systems. The data included a set of nine static pictures taken from different viewpoints, a video of each subject looking around a room, a video of the subject speaking, and one or more videos of the subject showing facial expressions. Colorado State University developed multiple systems for identification via facial recognition. Columbia University participated in implementing HumanID in poor weather.\n\nThe Bio-Surveillance project was designed to predict and respond to bioterrorism by monitoring non-traditional data sources such as animal sentinels, behavioral indicators, and pre-diagnostic medical data. It would leverage existing disease models, identify abnormal health early indicators, and mine existing databases to determine the most valuable early indicators for abnormal health conditions.\n\nAs a \"virtual, centralized, grand database\", the scope of surveillance includes, among others, credit card purchases, magazine subscriptions, web browsing histories, phone records, academic grades, bank deposits, gambling histories, passport applications, airline and railway tickets, driver's licenses, gun licenses, toll records, judicial records, divorce records, etc.\n\nHealth and biological information collected by TIA included drug prescriptions, medical records, fingerprints, gait, face and iris data, and individual DNA.\n\nThe Genisys component of TIA, in addition to integrating and organizing separate databases, was to run an internal \"Privacy Protection Program.\" This was intended to restrict analysts' access to irrelevant information on private U.S. citizens, enforce privacy laws and policies via software mechanisms, and report misuse of data. There were also plans for TIA to have an application that could \"anonymize\" data, so that information could be linked to an individual only through a court order (especially for medical records gathered by the Bio-Surveillance project). A set of audit logs were to be kept, which would keep track of whether innocent Americans' communications were getting caught up in relevant data.\n\nThe term \"total information awareness\" was first coined at the annual DARPAtech conference of 1999 in a presentation by the deputy director of the Office of Information Systems Management, Brian Sharkey. Sharkey applied the phrase to a conceptual method by which the government could sift through massive amounts of data becoming available via digitization and draw important conclusions.\n\nTIA was proposed as program shortly after the September 11 attacks in 2001 by Rear Admiral John Poindexter. A former national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan and a key player in the Iran–Contra affair, he was working with Syntek Technologies, a company often contracted out by the government for work on defense projects. TIA was officially commissioned during the 2002 fiscal year. Poindexter was appointed Director of the newly created Information Awareness Office division of DARPA in January 2002, which managed TIA's development. The office temporarily operated out of the fourth floor of DARPA's headquarters, while Poindexter looked around for a place which could permanently house TIA's researchers. Soon Project Genoa was successfully completed and its research moved on to Genoa II.\n\nLate that year, the Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) was awarded a $19 million contract by the Information Awareness Office to develop the \"Information Awareness Prototype System\", the core architecture to integrate all of TIA's information extraction, analysis, and dissemination tools. This was done through its consulting arm, Hicks & Associates, which employed many former Department of Defense and military officials.\n\nThe earliest version of TIA employed a software called Groove, which had been developed in 2000 by Ray Ozzie. Groove made it possible for analysts from many different government agencies to share intelligence data instantly, and it linked specialized programs that were designed to look for patterns of suspicious behavior.\n\nOn 24 January 2003, the United States Senate voted to limit the TIA program by restricting its ability to gather information from emails and the commercial databases of health, financial and travel companies. According to the \"Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-7, Division M, § 111(b)\" passed in February, the Department of Defense was given 90 days to compile a report laying out a schedule of TIA's development and the intended use of allotted funds or face a cutoff of support.\n\nThe report arrived on May 20. It disclosed that the program's computer tools were still in their preliminary testing phase. Concerning the pattern recognition of transaction information, only synthetic data created by researchers was being processed. The report also conceded that a full prototype of TIA wasn't scheduled to be ready until the 2007 fiscal year. Also in May, Total Information Awareness was renamed Terrorism Information Awareness in an attempt to stem the flow of criticism on its information gathering practices on average citizens.\n\nAt some point in early 2003, the National Security Agency began installing access nodes on TIA's classified network. The NSA then started running stacks of emails and intercepted communications through TIA's various programs.\n\nFollowing a scandal in the Department of Defense involving a proposal to reward investors who predicted terrorist attacks, John Poindexter resigned from office on 29 August.\n\nOn September 30, 2003, Congress officially cut off funding for TIA and the Information Awareness Office (with the Senate voting unanimously against it) because of its unpopular perception with the general public and the media. The effort was led by Senators Ron Wyden and Byron L. Dorgan.\n\nReports began to emerge in February 2006 that TIA's components had been transferred to the authority of the National Security Agency. In the Department of Defense appropriations bill for the 2004 fiscal year, a classified annex provided the funding. It was stipulated that the technologies were limited for military or foreign intelligence purposes against non-U.S. citizens. Most of the original project goals and research findings were preserved, but the privacy protection mechanics were abandoned.\n\nGenoa II, which focused on collaboration between machines and humans, was renamed \"Topsail\" and handed over to the NSA's Advanced Research and Development Activity, or ARDA (ARDA was later moved to the Director of National Intelligence's control as the Disruptive Technologies Office). Tools from the program were utilized in the war in Afghanistan and in other efforts as part of the War on Terror. In October 2005, the SAIC signed a $3.7 million contract for work on Topsail. In early 2006 a spokesman for the Air Force Research Laboratory said that Topsail was \"in the process of being canceled due to lack of funds.\" When inquired about Topsail in a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that February, both National Intelligence Director John Negroponte and FBI Director Robert Mueller said they didn't know about the program's status. Negroponte's deputy, former NSA Director Michael V. Hayden said, \"I'd like to answer in closed session.\"\n\nThe Information Awareness Prototype System was reclassified as \"Basketball\" and work on it continued by SAIC, supervised by ARDA. As far in as September 2004, Basketball was fully funded by the government and being tested in a research center jointly run by ARDA and SAIC. As of 2006, it was unknown whether this research persisted.\n\nCritics allege that the program could be abused by government authorities as part of their practice of mass surveillance in the United States. In an op-ed for \"The New York Times\", the American author William Safire called it \"the supersnoop's dream: a Total Information Awareness about every U.S. citizen.\"\n\nHans Mark, a former director of defense research and engineering at the University of Texas, called it a \"dishonest misuse of DARPA\".\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union launched a campaign to terminate the full implementation of Total Information Awareness, claiming that if implemented, it would \"kill privacy in America\" because \"every aspect of our lives would be catalogued\". The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" criticized the program for \"Fighting terror by terrifying U.S. citizens\".\n\nIn the 2008 British television series \"The Last Enemy\", Total Information Awareness (TIA) is portrayed as a UK-based surveillance database that can be used to track and monitor anybody effectively by putting all available government information in one place.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40813392", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40813392", "title": "Tragic Lovers", "text": "Tragic Lovers\n\nTragic Lovers is a classical music album by the Oregon Symphony under the artistic direction of James DePreist, released by the record label Delos in 2008. It contains three works inspired by tragic love stories in literature: Richard Wagner's Prelude and \"Liebestod\" from \"Tristan and Isolde\" (1865), Hector Berlioz's \"Love Scene\" from \"Roméo et Juliette\", Op. 17, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Romeo and Juliet\". Amelia Haygood and Carol Rosenberger served as executive producers of the album; the recording producers were Michael Fine and Adam Stern. The album's creation was financially supported by the Gretchen Brooks Recording Fund, which supported two recording sessions per year for each of DePreist's final five years as music director. \"Tragic Lovers\" was the orchestra's final recording with DePreist — who left the Oregon Symphony in April 2003 — as conductor and its final contribution to Delos's \"Virtual Reality Recording\" series.\n\nCompositions from the album have been broadcast on several stations, including Public Radio Exchange, WDAV, New England Public Radio (WFCR) and Northwest Public Radio. WFCR broadcast the Tchaikovsky recording in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday, and the Berlioz track in February 2013, following DePreist's death. The Classical Music Sentinel published a positive review of the album, comparing it to a three-movement symphony.\n\n\"Tragic Lovers\", released by the record label Delos in 2008, contains three works inspired by tragic love stories in literature: Richard Wagner's Prelude and \"Liebestod\" from \"Tristan and Isolde\", Hector Berlioz's \"Love Scene\" from \"Roméo et Juliette\", Op. 17, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's \"Romeo and Juliet\". The album contains three tracks, each one comprising a single composition and running more than fifteen minutes in length. Amelia Haygood and Carol Rosenberger served as executive producers; the recording producers were Michael Fine for the Wagner and Berlioz works and Adam Stern for the Tchaikovsky composition. The album was engineered by John Eargle, with Andrés Villalta serving as associate engineer for the Wagner and Berlioz recordings. Editing was completed by Fine (Wagner, Berlioz) and Stern (Tchaikovsky). The album marked the orchestra's final recording with DePreist as conductor and its final contribution to Delos's \"Virtual Reality Recording\" series.\n\nAll three compositions were featured on the Public Radio Exchange program \"Compact Discoveries\"; the Berlioz and Tchaikovsky recordings aired on an episode titled \"Famous Lovers: Romeo & Juliet\", and the Wagner recording was part of the following episode, titled \"More Famous Lovers\". In June 2009, Joe Brant featured the album on his WDAV program \"New Classics\", which highlights newly released classical music recordings. New England Public Radio (WFCR) aired two tracks from the album: the Tchaikovsky recording was broadcast in November 2011 in recognition of DePreist's 75th birthday, and the Berlioz track aired in November 2010 and again on February 11, 2013, following DePreist's death on February 8. The Berlioz recording also aired on the Northwest Public Radio program \"Classical Music with Robin Rilette\" on February 1, 2013.\n\nJean-Yves Duperron of the Classical Music Sentinel appreciated the continuity of the subject matter and compared the album to a three-movement symphony. Referring to the opener as the first movement of this hypothetical symphony, Duperron wrote that Wagner's composition \"works perfectly\" by setting the tone for the album. He appreciated the Berlioz composition as a \"central movement\" for its more \"pleasant\" mood and lighter musical textures, and Tchaikovsky's work as the finale for its dramatic and \"tumultuous\" qualities. Duperron complimented DePreist and the orchestra for conveying the emotions depicted in each of the compositions \"loud and clear\", and specifically highlighted the \"massive walls of sound\" produced by the strings. He also commended Delos for effectively capturing the performances \"with clean and powerful dynamics throughout\" and concluded the review by quipping: \"This perfectly coordinated collection should be part of every collection!\"\n\n\nTrack listing adapted from the album's liner notes.\n\n\nCredits adapted from AllMusic and the album's liner notes.\n\n"}
{"id": "2079925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2079925", "title": "Vampire films", "text": "Vampire films\n\nVampire films have been a staple since the era of silent films, so much so that the depiction of vampires in popular culture is strongly based upon their depiction in films throughout the years. The most popular cinematic adaptation of vampire fiction has been from Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", with over 170 versions to date. Running a distant second are adaptations of \"Carmilla\" by Sheridan Le Fanu. By 2005, Dracula had been the subject of more films than any other fictional character.\n\nAs folklore, vampires are defined by their need to feed on blood and on their manipulative nature; this theme has been held in common throughout the many adaptations. Although vampires are usually associated with the horror (and sometimes zombie genre), vampire films may also fall into the drama, action, science fiction, romance, comedy or fantasy genres, amongst others.\n\nEarly cinematic vampires in other such films as \"The Vampire\" (1913), directed by Robert G. Vignola, were not undead bloodsucking fiends, but 'vamps'. Such femme fatales were inspired by a poem by Rudyard Kipling called \"The Vampire\", composed in 1897. This poem was written as kind of commentary on a painting of a female vampire by Philip Burne-Jones exhibited in the same year. Lyrics from Kipling's poem: \"A fool there was ... \", describing a seduced man, were used as the title of the film \"A Fool There Was\" (1915) starring Theda Bara as the 'vamp' in question and the poem was used in the publicity for the film.\n\nAn authentic supernatural vampire features in the landmark \"Nosferatu\" (1922 Germany, directed by F. W. Murnau) starring Max Schreck as the hideous Count Orlok. This was an unlicensed version of Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\", based so closely on the novel that the estate sued and won, with all copies ordered to be destroyed. It would be painstakingly restored in 1994 by a team of European scholars from the five surviving prints that had escaped destruction. The destruction of the vampire, in the closing sequence of the film, by sunlight rather than the traditional stake through the heart proved very influential on later films and became an accepted part of vampire lore.\n\nThe next classic treatment of the vampire legend was an adaptation of the stage play based on Stoker's novel \"Dracula\", Universal's \"Dracula\" (1931) starring Bela Lugosi as Count Dracula. Lugosi's performance was so popular that his Hungarian accent and sweeping gestures became characteristics now commonly associated with Dracula. Five years after the release of the film, Universal released \"Dracula's Daughter\" (1936), a direct sequel that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, \"Son of Dracula\", starring Lon Chaney Jr. followed in 1943. Despite his apparent death in the 1931 film, the Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: \"House of Frankenstein\" (1944) and \"House of Dracula\" (1945)—both starring John Carradine—and \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948). While Lugosi had played a vampire in two other films during the 1930s and 1940s, it was only in this final film that he played Count Dracula on-screen for the second (and last) time.\n\nA transition between the Universal tradition and the later Hammer style is exemplified by the 1957 Mexican film \"El Vampiro\" that showed the vampire fangs (Universal did not).\n\nDracula was reincarnated for a new generation in Hammer Films series, starring Christopher Lee as the Count. In the first of these films \"Dracula\" (1958) the spectacular death of the title character through being exposed to the sun, reinforced this part of vampire lore, first established in \"Nosferatu\", and made it virtually axiomatic in succeeding films. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of the seven sequels. A more faithful adaptation of Stoker's novel appeared as \"Dracula\" (1992) directed by Francis Ford Coppola though also identifying Count Dracula with the notorious medieval Balkan ruler Vlad the Impaler.\n\nA distinct subgenre of vampire films, ultimately inspired by Le Fanu's \"Carmilla\" explored the topic of the lesbian vampire. Although implied in \"Dracula's Daughter\", the first openly lesbian vampire was in \"Blood and Roses\" (1960) by Roger Vadim. More explicit lesbian content was provided in Hammer's Karnstein Trilogy. The first of these, \"The Vampire Lovers\", (1970), starring Ingrid Pitt and Madeline Smith, was a relatively straightforward re-telling of LeFanu's novella, but with more overt violence and sexuality. Later films in this subgenre such as \"Vampyres\" (1974) became even more explicit in their depiction of sex, nudity and violence.\n\nBeginning with \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\" (1948) the vampire has often been the subject of comedy. \"The Fearless Vampire Killers\" (1967) by Roman Polanski was a notable parody of the genre. Other comedic treatments, of variable quality, include \"Vampira\" (1974) featuring David Niven as a lovelorn Dracula, \"Love at First Bite\" (1979) featuring George Hamilton, \"My Best Friend Is a Vampire\" (1988), \"Innocent Blood\" (1992), \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992), \"\" (1995), directed by Mel Brooks with Leslie Nielsen, and, more recently, Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement's mockumentary take on the subject, \"What We Do in the Shadows\" (2014).\n\nAnother development in some vampire films has been a change from supernatural horror to science fictional explanations of vampirism. \"The Last Man on Earth\" (1964, directed by Ubaldo Ragona), \"The Omega Man\" (1971 US, directed by Boris Sagal) and two other films were all based on Richard Matheson's novel \"I Am Legend\". They explain the condition as having a natural cause. Vampirism is explained as a kind of virus in David Cronenberg's \"Rabid\" (1976) and \"Red-Blooded American Girl\" (1990) directed by David Blyth, as well as in the \"Blade\" trilogy to a limited extent.\n\nRace has been another theme, as exemplified by the blaxploitation picture \"Blacula\" (1972) and its sequel \"Scream Blacula Scream\".\n\nThough always a representation of passion and desire, since the time of Béla Lugosi's \"Dracula\" (1931) the vampire, male or female, has usually been portrayed as an alluring sex symbol. Christopher Lee, Delphine Seyrig, Frank Langella, and Lauren Hutton are just a few examples of actors who brought great sex-appeal into their portrayal of the vampire. Latterly the implicit sexual themes of vampire film have become much more overt, culminating in such films as \"Gayracula\" (1983) and \"The Vampire of Budapest\", (1995), two pornographic all-male vampire films, and \"Lust for Dracula\" (2005), a softcore pornography all-lesbian adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic.\n\nThere is, however, a very small subgenre, pioneered in Murnau's seminal \"Nosferatu\" (1922) in which the portrayal of the vampire is similar to the hideous creature of European folklore. Max Schrek's disturbing portrayal of this role in Murnau's film was copied by Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's remake \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979). In \"Shadow of the Vampire\" (2000). directed by E. Elias Merhige, Willem Dafoe plays Max Schrek, himself, though portrayed here as an actual vampire. Dafoe's character is the ugly, disgusting creature of the original \"Nosferatu\". Stephen King's \"Salem's Lot\" (1979) notably depicts vampires as terrifying, simple-minded creatures, without erotism, and with the only desire to feed on the blood of others. The main vampire in the Subspecies films, Radu, also exhibits similar aesthetic influences, such as long fingers and nails and generally grotesque facial features. This type of vampire is also featured in the film 30 Days of Night.\n\nA major character in most vampire films is the vampire hunter, of which Stoker's Abraham Van Helsing is a prototype. However, killing vampires has changed. Where Van Helsing relied on a stake through the heart, in \"Vampires\" 1998, directed by John Carpenter, Jack Crow (James Woods) has a heavily armed squad of vampire hunters, and in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" (1992, directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui), writer Joss Whedon (who created TV's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and spin-off \"Angel\") attached The Slayer, Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson in the film, Sarah Michelle Gellar in the TV series), to a network of Watchers and mystically endowed her with superhuman powers.\n\nBy far, the most well-known and popular vampire in the films is Count Dracula. An amazing number of films have been filmed over the years depicting the evil count, some of which are ranked among the greatest depictions of vampires on film. Dracula has over 170 film representations to date making him the most frequently portrayed character in horror films; also he has highest number of film appearances overall followed by Sherlock Holmes.\n\nOne of the first television series with a vampire as a main character was the 1964 comedy series \"The Munsters\". Lily Munster and Grandpa (also known as Vladimir Dracula, Count of Transylvania) are vampires.\n\n\"The Munsters\" was followed in 1966 by the Gothic soap opera \"Dark Shadows\", in which the vampire Barnabas Collins became a main character. \n\nIn 1985 \"The Little Vampire\" was a television series made for children. It tells the adventures of the vampire child Rüdiger and his human friend Anton.\n\n\"Forever Knight\" (1992–1996) was the first vampire detective story, later followed by many similar series like \"Angel\", \"Moonlight\", \"Blood Ties\" and \"Vampire Prosecutor\".\n\nIn 1997 the teenage vampire series \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" became popular around the world. Buffy is a teenage girl who finds out that she is a vampire slayer. She also finds herself drawn to a vampire.\n\n\"True Blood\" (2008) centers on the adventures of the telepathic waitress Sookie Stackhouse who falls in love with a vampire. In the same year BBC Three series \"Being Human\" became popular in Britain. It features an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol.\n\nIn 2009 \"The Vampire Diaries\" told the story of the school girl Elena Gilbert, who falls in love with vampire Stefan Salvatore but finds herself also drawn to Stefan's brother Damon Salvatore.\n\n\"The Strain\" (2014) is based on the novel of the same name by Guillermo del Toro.\n\nOne of the first animated vampire series was the 1989 series \"Count Duckula\", a parody of Dracula. In 1985, the anime film adaptation of the inaugural \"Vampire Hunter D\" novel was released direct to video, and became popular in both Japan and the United States, prompting an adaptation of the third novel into the also direct to video film \"\" in 2000. The two films and the novels they are based on revolve around the eponymous D, a vampire hunter who is the apparent half-vampire/half-human son of Dracula who battles vampires in the year 12,090 AD. In 1997 the anime series \"Vampire Princess Miyu\" became popular in Japan, many other anime followed. Later in 2012, \"Hotel Transylvania\" was released, followed by a sequel in 2015, \"Hotel Transylvania 2\" and in 2018's \".\n\nAnother Japanese anime series, \"Rosario + Vampire\", portrays one of the leading female characters, Moka Akashiya, as a vampire, whose demonic powers are sealed inside her with a rosary seal on her neck. The series portrays other kinds of fictional monsters as well, including a witch and a snow-woman.\n\nFrom 2001 onward vampire web series became popular around the world. One of the first web series was the 2001 series \"The Hunted\". It is about a group of vampire slayers who have been bitten by vampires (but not yet turned into vampires) and try to fight the bloodsucking vampires. \"The Hunted\" was followed by \"\" (2007) and \"\" (2008) who were based on the films \"30 Days of Night\" and \"\". In 2009 the MTV online series \"Valemont\" follows Maggie Gracen who decides to infiltrate Valemont University, because her brother Eric has vanished. She soon finds out that the University is full of vampires. The 2009 web series \"I Heart Vampires\" focuses on two teenage vampire fans who find out that vampires are more than real. In 2011 the \"Being Human\" spin-off \"Becoming Human\" was released online. It is about a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who go to a school together and try to solve a murder.

{"id": "48627029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48627029", "title": "YouTube copyright issues", "text": "YouTube copyright issues\n\nWhen a person creates an original work that is fixed in a physical medium, he or she automatically owns copyright to the work. The owner has the exclusive right to use the work in certain, specific ways. In response to a lawsuit from Viacom, video sharing service YouTube developed a copyright enforcement tool referred to as Content ID which automatically scans uploaded content against a database of copyrighted material ingested by third-parties. If an uploaded video is matched against an asset in the database, YouTube warns the user of the match and applies a predetermined 'match policy'.\n\nIn December 2013, YouTube enabled automated Content ID claiming on videos uploaded by users who were signed with multi-channel networks (MCN). Previously, videos uploaded to channels that were linked to MCNs could only be claimed manually or removed with a DMCA takedown. This led to a large amount of new claims which suddenly left uploaders unable to place advertisements on their videos until they disputed. Users such as Angry Joe created videos complaining about the changes and how they would negatively affect the livelihoods of video creators.\n\nThe sudden increase in claims especially affected channels which uploaded content featuring video games (such as Let's Plays) and movies (such as reviews).\n\nPopular YouTubers the Fine Brothers, received criticism for their attempts to trademark and license content. Specifically, the brothers, who produce multiple series of \"reaction videos\", applied for trademarks in 2015 for the word \"react\" along with the names of their different series such as \"Kids React\" and \"Adults React\".\n\nBy having these terms trademarked, the Fine Bros. could use Youtube's copyright system to help them remove videos similar to their own.\n\nIn 2016, they announced React World, a program where people could use the Fine Bros.'s icons to make their own videos for free, but there were limitations that their content must be monetized on YouTube (with Google AdSense) and that the Fine Bros. would take some of the money that the creator made. That started to cause controversy with the Fine Bros. and the \"Reaction\" video genre to the point where the Fine Bros. cancelled the program and lost more than 400,000 subscribers, by some accounts. Due to the criticism, the Fine Bros. also rescinded their trademarks and applications.\n\nOutcries arose from the YouTube community in late 2015 and onward, regarding the unfair removal of YouTube videos and even entire channels based upon allegations of copyright infringement, many of which were invalid as no fair use laws were broken. Much of the controversy erupted when a review of the film \"Cool Cat Saves the Kids\" by the channel I Hate Everything was removed from YouTube on November 9, 2015. Videos by large channels such as Channel Awesome and Markiplier were being taken down and deleted from the website; complaints sparked across YouTube, as well as on the social media site Twitter.\n\nOn February 26, 2016, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki responded to the controversy on Twitter, writing \"Thank you @YouTube community for all the feedback. We're listening\".\n\nOn the May 24, 2016, YouTube user Matt Hosseinzadeh sued Ethan and Hila Klein of the YouTube channel h3h3productions citing a video that criticized his content. Fellow YouTube user Philip DeFranco started a GoFundMe fundraiser entitled \"Help for H3H3\". The initiative raised over $130,000. The Kleins later uploaded a video where they announced that any funds from the fundraiser left over from their lawsuit would be entrusted in to a 'Fair Use Protection Account', which other users could request assistance from in the event they were sued for copyright infringement.\n\nOn April 25, 2016, YouTuber and freelance video game critic Jim Sterling included clips of footage from , \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"\", as well as the song \"Chains of Love\", in a video largely discussing \"Star Fox Zero\". Sterling explained this at the end of the video as a way of preventing Nintendo from claiming and monetizing the video by including other material which was similarly flagged by Content ID, hoping that multiple claims would prevent anyone from monetizing the video and running advertisements on his channel, which is intended to be ad-free and funded solely by Patreon. In a follow-up video, he claimed that the technique, which he termed the \"copyright deadlock\" had succeeded, as the video received multiple ContentID claims, one of which attempted to monetize the video, while two others prevented any monetization, allowing the video to run advertisement-free. Sterling stated that this was indicative of a poorly designed system on YouTube's part, as a video which was well within the bounds of fair use had attracted three copyright claims. He also claimed that he would continue to include material which had previously received Content ID claims in videos likely to attract monetization attempts from the copyright owners, since fair use was not protecting his videos from copyright claims, pointing out that he now felt incentivized to use as much copyrighted material in his videos as possible, the opposite of what YouTube's copyright policies were intended to achieve.\n"}

A complete Yuga starts with the \"Satya Yuga\", via \"Treta Yuga\" and \"Dvapara Yuga\" into a \"Kali Yuga\". Our present time is a \"Kali Yuga\", which started at 3102 BCE with the end of the Kurukshetra War (or Mahabharata war).\n\nThere are four Yugas in one cycle:\n\n\nAccording to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:\n\nTogether, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga and equal 4.32 million human years. According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of Brahma or 4.32 billion human years. A Mahakalpa consists of 100 years of Brahma.\n\nAccording to Srimad Bhagavatam 3.11.19, which most scholars agree was composed around 500 to 1000 CE, the Yugas are much longer, using a divine year in which one day is equal to one human year, thus:\nThe Viṣṇu Purāṇa Time measurement section of the Viṣṇu Purāṇa Book I Chapter III adds:\n\n\nWhile the long yuga count is the most popular, it does not correlate to any known celestial motion found in the Astronomical Almanac. The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full precession of the equinox, which takes 25,772 years. Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. Srimad Bhagavatam 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the devas, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.\n\nThe ages see a gradual decline of dharma, wisdom, knowledge, intellectual capability, life span, emotional and physical strength.\n\nIn the present days we may be said to live in a \"Kali Yuga\", which is said to have started in 3102 BCE with the end of the Mahabharata war. This date is also considered by many Hindus to be the day that Krishna left Earth and went to his abode.\n\n\n"}
