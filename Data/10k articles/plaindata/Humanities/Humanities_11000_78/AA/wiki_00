Although his roots were Arabic, he was often referred to as the Sibawayh of his era due to his knowledge of the Arabic language despite his upbringing in a non-Arab country.\n\nZahiri was born in 1923 in what was then the British Raj, to a family of Arab descent. Through their family tree, Zahiri's parents could trace their original roots back to Umar, the second caliph of Islam and of the Rashidun Caliphate, and thus the Banu Adi clan of the Quraysh tribe.\n\nZahiri traveled extensively in pursuit of Islamic manuscripts, which he often copied by hand due to lack of resources. During his younger years, he visited Western Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. He eventually ended up in Egypt, where he earned his master's and doctoral degrees at Al-Azhar University, and was also a student of fellow Hadith specialist Ahmad Muhammad Shakir. Later, Zahiri settled down in Saudi Arabia at the behest of first King of Saudi Arabia Ibn Saud, who requested that Zahiri teach Muslim theology in Mecca's Masjid al-Haram, the holiest site in Islam. Zahiri's best known student was Abu Abd al-Rahman Ibn Aqil al-Zahiri, who shared Zahiri's pen name due to their adherence to the Zahirite school of Islamic law. Zahiri also had a friendship with fellow foreigner in Saudi Arabia, Abdallah Bin Bayyah.\n\nZahiri died on Saturday morning, the 21st of Safar in 1423 Hijri, corresponding to May 4, 2002 Gregorian. While in his private library, Zahiri complained of paralysis in his feet to an aide. Prevented from pronouncing the Muslim testimony of faith due to aphasia, Zahiri died on his bed pointing toward the sky instead. He was buried in Mecca's historic Jannatul Mualla cemetery the next morning.\n\nZahiri authored roughly fifty published works. Although he was fluent in Persian and Urdu and conversational in multiple Languages of India, most of his written work was in Arabic.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a distinct literary phenomenon which is increasingly studied as such by academics.\n\nIn the words of Arnold Erickson:\n\nPrison has been a fertile setting for artists, musicians, and writers alike. Prisoners have produced hundreds of works that have encompassed a wide range of literature. [...] Books describing the prison experience, including the Autobiography of Malcolm X, inspired an audience far outside the prison walls. The importance of these works have been recognized in this country's highest courts. See Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. New York State Crime Victim's Compensation Board, 502 U.S. 105, 121-122 (1991)(citing works by prisoners).\n\nThe emergence of prison writing relied on convicts with the necessary writing skills to tell their stories from the inside. Early writings came from prisoners who had already begun to publish before being arrested. Among these early-20th-century writers was Jack London, who in 1894 spent a month in New York State's Erie County Penitentiary. This transformative experience informed much of his writing.\n\nPrison writing has often been seen as an act of political resistance. In the first two decades of the 20th century, the prisoners who were published were primarily social activists. Socialist writer Kate Richards O'Hare, spent a year in prison (1919–1920), causing her to dedicate her life to exposing the horrors of prison conditions and the economic structure by which they were supported. Anarchist activists Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman also wrote while imprisoned, deepening their philosophical convictions and influencing people worldwide.\n\nOne of the most widely read early accounts of prison life in the 20th century was \"My Life in Prison\" (1912), by Donald Lowrie. The book inspired Thomas Mott Osborne, who later became warden at Sing Sing, to dedicate his career to prison reform. In 1924, after World War I, H.L. Mencken founded the \"American Mercury\" magazine and regularly published convict authors.\n\nAt the onset of the Great Depression, authorities began to perceive prison writing as more of a threat to American society. Manuscripts were potentially profitable subversive tools, and therefore all writing was suppressed.\n\nIn 1932, Robert E. Burns published his memoir \"I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang\", which was subsequently made into the movie \"I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang\". As a prison escapee, he wrote to expose the realities of prison slavery. During this time, the entire population felt the effects of poverty, crime, and hardship, making more people receptive to prison narratives.\n\nChester Himes began writing after going to prison for armed robbery. He reported: \"When I could see the end of my time inside I bought myself a typewriter and taught myself to touch type. I'd been reading stories by Dashiell Hammett in \"Black Mask\" and I thought I could do them just as well. When my stories finally appeared, the other convicts thought exactly the same thing. There was nothing to it. All you had to do was tell it like it is.\"\n\nAnother writer to emerge during the 1930s was Nelson Algren, whose short story \"El Presidente de Mejico\" explored his experience in a Texas jail.\n\nThe \"Autobiography of Malcolm X\", published in 1965, was the first full-length memoir of an African-American convict. Co-written by Alex Haley, the book was published the same year that X was assassinated. Prisoners and ex-prisoners began using the printed word to participate in revolutionary activities. Among those influenced by Malcolm X were Eldridge Cleaver, Iceberg Slim, Piri Thomas, and Jack Henry Abbott.\n\nPrison writing's literary renaissance coincided with social and political unrest of the 1960s and 1970s. There was tremendous support for incarcerated writers, since they represented an important front of the culture war. Inner city riots and prison riots exemplified the volatile emotional state of the entire population. The 1971 escape attempt by a San Quentin inmate and author, George Jackson (Soledad Brother), ended in bloodshed. Another activist author, Angela Davis, was implicated in the event because a gun was used that was registered in her name. Jackson's shooting lead to a mass hunger strike at New York's Attica Prison. The strike eventually lead to a prisoner uprising and a subsequent police assault leaving 128 wounded and 39 dead, 10 of them hostages.\n\nBy the late 1970s, prison writing was being published extensively in \"mass-market paperbacks, newspapers, magazines, major motion pictures.\" In the 1980s and 1990s, however, there was something of a backlash. New York State led the legislative attack against prison writing. In 1977, the \"Son of Sam\" law made it illegal for convict authors to collect money from the writings. Some claim that \"[a]lthough ostensibly designed to 'protect the victim' and to keep criminals from profiting from their crimes, the real purpose of these laws was identical to the purpose of the repression of prison literature in the 1930s: to keep the American people in the dark about the American prison.\"\n\nAccording to Bell Gale Chevigny (1999), prison writing began to go out of fashion in the 1980s. One event triggering this reaction was the 1981 publication of the letters that Jack Henry Abbott wrote from prison to Norman Mailer. This enormously popular publication, entitled \"In the Belly of the Beast\", documented the rage Abbott had cultivated in his years of incarceration. Within six weeks of his release from prison, Abbott killed a man during a fight.\n\nOne of the few institutions that still continues to support prison writing is the PEN American Center.\n\nPEN American Center (Poets, Playwrights, Essayists, Editors and Novelists) is a national chapter of an international association of writers working towards peace. The Center established its Prison Writing Program in 1971, when PEN president Tom Fleming began lobbying for educational opportunities for prisoners. These efforts resulted in reduced censorship, better access to typewriters, classes, and improved prison libraries.\n\nIn 1973, PEN began its annual prison writing contest. Though it had some very difficult years in the 1980s, the contest has taken place every year since its inception. The Prison Writing Program continues to provide mentoring opportunities and to publish information concerning prison writing, as well as anthologizing contest winners.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Situated 24 km northeast of Kurukshetra, the site is notable for showing an overlap between the late Harappan and Painted Grey Ware cultures. Painted Grey Ware is generally associated with the Vedic people, so this area can be said as the junction of two great civilizations of India.\n\nAn archaeological museum at Sheikh Chilli's Tomb complex in Thanesar established by the Archaeological Survey of India consists of archaeological finds like a humped bull-shaped carnelian pendant, terracotta beads and semi-precious stones from sites in Bhagwanpura.\n\nBhagwanpura shows one period of habitation, with two sub-periods:\n\nDuring sub-period IA, the late Harappan people lived in houses of burnt brick and built mud platforms to protect against flooding. During sub-period IB, the late Harappan pottery continued, but a new form of pottery (the PGW) was introduced. Initially, the PGW people lived in thatched wattle-and-daub huts, but later they began to build mud-walled houses. One large house had thirteen rooms and a courtyard, and may have belonged to a chief. Towards the end of sub-period IB, the PGW people began to use burnt bricks, but no complete structures have been found. During both phases, cattle, sheep, and pig were domesticated, but horse bones have only been found in sub-period IB. Six oval structures from this sub-period may have had some ritualistic use.\n\nSome scholars believe that the burnt bricks (square, rectangular, and wedge-shaped) from sub-period IB were not in fact used for building houses, but for the construction of Vedic fire altars.\n\n"}

Students take a day-long vow of silence to symbolically represent the silencing of LGBTQ students.\n\nThe Day of Silence has been held each year in April since 1996. From 2011 to 2017, the Day of Silence was held on the third Friday in April except for April 11, 2014; in 2018 it was observed on Friday, April 27.\n\nThe Day of Silence is organized by the GLSEN.\nStudents are encouraged to obtain permission from their school before organizing the event.\n\nGLSEN states that hundreds of thousands of students at more than 8,000 schools participated in the 2008 Day of Silence.\nCreated by then-student Maria Pulzetti, the first event was organized by students at University of Virginia in 1996. Pulzetti explained: \"I wanted to do something for BGLAD week that would impact many people at the school and that would be very visible...I knew that if we held panel discussions and events like that, the only people who would come would be the people who already were fairly aware.\"\n\nIn 1997, Day of Silence went national, with almost 100 colleges and universities participating.\n\nIn 2000, Pulzetti's classmates Jessie Gilliam and Chloe Palenchar, and GLSEN National Student Organizer Chris Tuttle, developed the proposal for the day to become an official project of GLSEN. GLSEN developed its first-ever \"student leadership team\" as part of the Day of Silence.\n\nIn 2008, the Day of Silence was held in memory of Lawrence \"Larry\" King, an eighth grader from E.O. Green Middle School who was shot by classmate Brandon McInerney.\n\nIn the last several years, over 10,000 participants have registered their participation with GLSEN each year. These participants attend middle schools, high schools, colleges, and universities. They include students from all 50 states in the U.S.A. as well as students from around the world, including New Zealand, Singapore, and Russia.\n\nIn 2005, the Alliance Defense Fund began sponsoring a yearly counter-protest called the Day of Truth. \"Events like these actually end up promoting homosexuality in public schools, and that actually creates a hostile climate for students of faith,\" said Candi Cushman, an education analyst for Focus on the Family. A card carried by participants in the Day of Truth reads: \"true tolerance means that people with differing—even opposing—viewpoints can freely exchange ideas and respectfully listen to each other. It's time for an honest conversation about homosexuality. There's freedom to change if you want to. Let's talk.\"\n\nOther socially conservative organizations, including the American Family Association, Concerned Women for America, Mission America, Traditional Values Coalition, Americans for Truth, and Liberty Counsel, opposed the Day of Silence in 2008 by forming a coalition urging parents to keep their kids home on the DOS if students at their school were observing it. The Rev. Ken Hutcherson, the principal supporter of those who skipped school, said, \"We want education, not indoctrination.\"\n\nIn April 2010, in opposition to the Day of Silence, several students in Laingsburg High School in Laingsburg, Michigan wore T-shirts stating \"Straight Pride\" on the front side and bore a reference to on the back. That Bible verse refers to homosexual behaviour as an abomination and prescribes death as the penalty for it. The same protest, which was organized on a Facebook group, also took place in the St. Johns and Bath school districts.\n\nOn October 6, 2010, CNN reported that Exodus International, which promotes \"freedom from homosexuality through Jesus Christ\", would not support the 2011 annual Day of Truth as the organization had done in 2010. President Alan Chambers stated, \"All the recent attention to bullying helped us realize that we need to equip kids to live out biblical tolerance and grace while treating their neighbors as they'd like to be treated, whether they agree with them or not.\"\n\nIn 2011, Focus on the Family acquired the “Day of Truth” event and renamed it into the “Day of Dialogue”. As of 2012, the Day of Dialogue website stated: \"Now it boasts a new name, while maintaining the same goal it’s always had since its founding — encouraging honest and respectful conversation among students about God’s design for sexuality.\"\n\n\n"}

The last phase of construction was dated by an Aramaic inscription to 244 CE, making it one of the oldest synagogues in the world. It was unique among the many ancient synagogues that have emerged from archaeological digs as the structure was preserved virtually intact, and it had extensive figurative wall-paintings, which came as a considerable surprise to scholars. These paintings are now displayed in the National Museum of Damascus.\n\nDura-Europos was a small garrison and trading city on the river Euphrates, and usually on the frontier between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Parthian and finally the Sassanid Empires of Persia. It changed hands at various points but was Roman from 165 CE. Before the final Persian destruction of the town in 256-257 CE, parts of the synagogue which abutted the main city wall were apparently requisitioned and filled with sand as a defensive measure. The city was abandoned after its fall and never resettled, and the lower walls of the rooms remained buried and largely intact until excavated. The excavations discovered also very important wall-paintings from places of worship of Christianity, at the Dura-Europos church, and Mithraism, and fragmentary Christian texts in Hebrew.\n\nIn the Syrian Civil War, the site was occupied by ISIL, and what was left there appears to have been destroyed.\n\nBecause of the paintings adorning the walls, the synagogue was at first mistaken for a Greek temple, though this was quickly corrected by the vice-director of excavations Robert du Mesnil du Buisson in \"Les peintures de la synagogue de Doura-Europos\" (Rome, 1939). Mesnil also made detailed comparisons of the friezes from the Dura synagogue with those of the mithraeum, the Christian baptistery, and the temple of the Palmyrene gods.\n\nThe synagogue contains a forecourt and house of assembly with painted walls depicting people and animals, and a Torah shrine in the western wall facing Jerusalem. The paintings cover the walls of the main \"Assembly Room\", using three levels of pictures over a dado frieze of symbols in most places, reaching a height of about 7 metres. The scenes depicted are drawn from the Hebrew Bible and include many narrative scenes, and some single figure \"portraits\"—58 scenes in total, probably representing about 60% of the original number. They include the \"Sacrifice of Isaac\" and other Genesis stories, Moses receiving the Tablets of the Law, Moses leading the Hebrews out of Egypt, the visions of Ezekiel, and many others. The Hand of God motif is used to represent divine intervention or approval in several paintings. Scholars cannot agree on the subjects of some scenes, because of damage, or the lack of comparative examples.\n\nStylistically they are provincial versions of contemporary Graeco-Roman style and technique; several different artists seem to have worked on them. Technically they are not fresco (paint fused into wet plaster) but tempera over plaster. Earlier parts of the building have decorative painting with no figures. Some of the paintings have figures whose eyes have been scratched out, especially those in Persian costume.\n\nScholars think the paintings were used as an instructional display to educate and teach the history and laws of the religion. Some think that this synagogue was painted in order to compete with the many other religions practiced in Dura Europos; the new (and considerably smaller) Christian church (Dura-Europos church) appears to have opened shortly before the surviving paintings were begun in the synagogue. The large-scale pictorial art in the synagogue came as a surprise to scholars, although they already suspected that there was a tradition of Jewish narrative religious art at this period, which had all been lost, leaving only traces in later Christian art. The discovery of the synagogue helps to dispel narrow interpretations of Judaism's historical prohibition of visual images.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33926747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33926747", "title": "Evolutionary aesthetics", "text": "Evolutionary aesthetics\n\nEvolutionary aesthetics refers to evolutionary psychology theories in which the basic aesthetic preferences of \"Homo sapiens\" are argued to have evolved in order to enhance survival and reproductive success.\n\nBased on this theory, things like color preference, preferred mate body ratios, shapes, emotional ties with objects, and many other aspects of the aesthetic experience can be explained with reference to human evolution.\n\nMany animal and human traits have been argued to have evolved in order to enhance survival and reproductive success. Evolutionary psychology extends this to psychological traits including aesthetical preferences. Such traits are generally seen as being adaptations to the environment during the Pleistocene era and are not necessarily adaptative in our present environment. Examples include disgust of potentially harmful spoiled foods; pleasure from sex and from eating sweet and fatty foods; and fear of spiders, snakes, and the dark.\n\nAll known cultures have some form of art. This universality suggests that art is related to evolutionary adaptations. The strong emotions associated with art suggest the same.\n\nAn important choice for a mobile organism is selecting a good habitat to live in. Humans are argued to have strong aesthetical preferences for landscapes which were good habitats in the ancestral environment. When young human children from different nations are asked to select which landscape they prefer, from a selection of standardized landscape photographs, there is a strong preference for savannas with trees. The East African savanna is the ancestral environment in which much of human evolution is argued to have taken place. There is also a preference for landscapes with water, with both open and wooded areas, with trees with branches at a suitable height for climbing and taking foods, with features encouraging exploration such as a path or river curving out of view, with seen or implied game animals, and with some clouds. These are all features that are often featured in calendar art and in the design of public parks.\n\nA survey of art preferences in many different nations found that realistic painting was preferred. Favorite features were water, trees as well as other plants, humans (in particular beautiful women, children, and well-known historical figures), and animals (in particular both wild and domestic large animals). Blue, followed by green, was the favorite color. Using the survey, the study authors constructed a painting showing the preferences of each nation. Despite the many different cultures, the paintings all showed a strong similarity to landscape calendar art. The authors argued that this similarity was in fact due to the influence of the Western calendar industry. Another explanation is that these features are those evolutionary psychology predicts should be popular for evolutionary reasons.\n\nVarious evolutionary concerns have been argued to influence what is perceived to be physically attractive.\n\nSuch evolutionary based preferences are not necessarily static but may vary depending on environmental cues. Thus, availability of food influences which female body size is attractive which may have evolutionary reasons. Societies with food scarcities prefer larger female body size than societies having plenty of food. In Western society males who are hungry prefer a larger female body size than they do when not hungry.\n\nEvolutionary musicology is a subfield of biomusicology that grounds the psychological mechanisms of music perception and production in evolutionary theory. It covers vocal communication in non-human animal species, theories of the evolution of human music, and cross-cultural human universals in musical ability and processing. It also includes evolutionary explanations for what is considered aesthetically pleasing or not.\n\nDarwinian Literary Studies (aka Literary Darwinism) is a branch of literary criticism that studies literature, including aesthetical aspects, in the context of evolution.\n\nAesthetics are tied to emotions. There are several explanations regarding the evolution of emotion.\n\nOne example is the emotion disgust which has been argued to have evolved in order to avoid several harmful actions such as infectious diseases due to contact with spoiled foods, feces, and decaying bodies.\n\nThe sexy son hypothesis suggests that a female optimal choice among potential mates is a male whose genes will produce male offspring with the best chance of reproductive success by having trait(s) being attractive to other females. Sometimes the trait may have no reproductive benefit in itself, apart from attracting females, because of Fisherian runaway. The peacock's tail may be one example. It has also been seen as an example of the handicap principle.\n\nIt has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what is needed for survival on the savanna. One explanation could be that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the equivalent of the peacock's tail for humans. According to this theory superior execution of art was important because it attracted mates.\n"}

The narrative of the \"Historia Compostelana\" spans the years 1100 – 1139, the years of Gelmírez' tenure, in three books. Its twofold central agenda is to extol the Archbishop's doings, while establishing the foundation and rights of Santiago de Compostela, including its founding legend, which provided apostolic connections with Saint James the Great. The bishopric had been transferred from Iria Flavia to Compostela as recently as 1095.\n\nFrom a Galician perspective the \"Historia\" recounts the reigns of the contemporary sovereigns of Castile: Alfonso VI (until 1109), Urraca (1109–1126) and Alfonso VII (from 1126). \"A very complex work of multiple authorship, it must be used with care, for it is essentially an episcopal gesta of Diego Gelmírez, bishop and then archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, and very partisan in its commentary,\" is the assessment of the major historian of this period, Bernard F.

Paul Hopper originally proposed emergent grammar as a functional approach to the study of syntax in 1987. Later work expanded to include approaches to phonology and other aspects of grammar.\n\nEmergent grammar postulates that rules of grammar emerge as language is used. This is contrary to the \"a priori grammar postulate\", the idea that grammar rules exist in the mind before the production of utterances. Contrary to the principles of generative grammar and the concept of Universal Grammar, interactional linguistics asserts that grammar emerges from interactions among language users. Whereas Universal Grammar claims that features of grammar are innate, emergent grammar and other interactional theories claim that the human language faculty has no innate grammar and that features of grammar are learned through experience and social interaction.\n\nInteractional linguistics has developed in linguistic discourse analysis and conversation analysis, and is used to investigate the relationship between grammatical structure and real-time interaction and language use.\n\nScholars in interactional linguistics draw from functional linguistics, conversation analysis, and linguistic anthropology in order to describe \"the way in which language figures in everyday interaction and cognition.\" Studies in interactional linguistics view linguistic forms, including syntactic and prosodic structures, as greatly affected by interactions among participants in speech, signing, or other language use. The field contrasts with dominant approaches to linguistics during the twentieth century, which tended to focus either on the form of language per se, or on theories of individual language user's linguistic competence.\n\n"}

{"id": "238143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238143", "title": "J. L. Austin", "text": "J. L. Austin\n\nJohn Langshaw Austin (26 March 1911 – 8 February 1960) was a British philosopher of language and leading proponent of ordinary language philosophy, perhaps best known for developing the theory of speech acts.\n\nAustin pointed out that we use language to \"do\" things as well as to \"assert\" things, and that the utterance of a statement like \"I promise to do so-and-so\" is best understood as \"doing\" something — \"making a promise\" — rather than making an assertion about anything. Hence the name of one of his best-known works \"How to Do Things with Words\". Austin, in providing his theory of speech acts, makes a significant challenge to the philosophy of language, far beyond merely elucidating a class of morphological sentence forms that function to do what they name. Austin's work ultimately suggests that all speech and all utterance is the doing of something with words and signs, challenging a metaphysics of language that would posit denotative, propositional assertion as the essence of language and meaning.\n\nAustin was born in Lancaster, England, the second son of Geoffrey Langshaw Austin (1884–1971), an architect, and his wife Mary Hutton Bowes-Wilson (1883–1948; \"née\" Wilson). In 1921 the family moved to Scotland, where Austin's father became the secretary of St Leonards School, St Andrews. Austin was educated at Shrewsbury School in 1924, earning a scholarship in Classics, and went on to study Classics at Balliol College, Oxford in 1929.\n\nIn 1933, he received a First in Literae Humaniores (Classics and Philosophy) as well as the Gaisford Prize for Greek prose and first class honours in his finals. Literae Humaniores introduced him to serious philosophy and gave him a lifelong interest in Aristotle. He undertook his first teaching position in 1935, as fellow and tutor at Magdalen College, Oxford.\n\nAustin's early interests included Aristotle, Kant, Leibniz, and Plato (especially the \"Theaetetus\"). His more contemporary influences included especially G. E. Moore, John Cook Wilson and H. A. Prichard. The contemporary influences shaped their views about general philosophical questions on the basis of careful attention to the more specific judgements we make. They took our specific judgements to be more secure than more general judgements. It's plausible that some aspects of Austin's distinctive approach to philosophical questions derived from his engagement with the last three.\n\nDuring World War II Austin served in the British Intelligence Corps. It has been said of him that, \"he more than anybody was responsible for the life-saving accuracy of the D-Day intelligence\" (reported in Warnock 1963: 9). Austin left the army with the rank of lieutenant colonel and was honored for his intelligence work with an OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire), the French Croix de guerre, and the U.S. Officer of the Legion of Merit.\n\nAfter the war Austin became White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford, as a Professorial Fellow of Corpus Christi College. He began holding his famous \"Austin's Saturday Mornings\" where students and colleagues would discuss language usages (and sometimes books on language) over tea and crumpets, but published little.\n\nAustin visited Harvard and Berkeley in the mid-fifties, in 1955 delivering the William James Lectures at Harvard that would become \"How to Do Things With Words\", and offering a seminar on excuses whose material would find its way into \"A Plea for Excuses\". It was at this time that he met and befriended Noam Chomsky. He was president of the Aristotelian Society from 1956 to 1957.\n\nAustin died at the age of 48 of lung cancer. At the time, he was developing a semantic theory based on sound symbolism, using the English gl-words as data.\n\n\"How to Do Things with Words\" (1955/1962) is perhaps Austin's most influential work. In contrast to the positivist view, he argues, sentences with truth-values form only a small part of the range of utterances.\n\nAfter introducing several kinds of sentences which he asserts are neither true nor false, he turns in particular to one of these kinds of sentences, which he calls \"performative utterances\" or just \"performatives\". These he characterises by two features:\n\n\nHe goes on to say that when something goes wrong in connection with a performative utterance it is, as he puts it, \"infelicitous\", or \"unhappy\" rather than false.\n\nThe action which is performed when a 'performative utterance' is issued belongs to what Austin later calls a \"speech-act\" (more particularly, the kind of action Austin has in mind is what he subsequently terms the \"illocutionary act\"). For example, if you say \"I name this ship the \"Queen Elizabeth\",\" and the circumstances are appropriate in certain ways, then you will have done something special, namely, you will have performed the act of naming the ship. Other examples include: \"I take this man as my lawfully wedded husband,\" used in the course of a marriage ceremony, or \"I bequeath this watch to my brother,\" as occurring in a will. In all three cases the sentence is not being used to describe or state what one is 'doing', but being used to actually 'do' it.\n\nAfter numerous attempts to find more characteristics of performatives, and after having met with many difficulties, Austin makes what he calls a \"fresh start\", in which he considers \"more generally the senses in which to say something may be to do something, or in saying something we do something\".\n\nFor example: John Smith turns to Sue Snub and says ‘Is Jeff’s shirt red?’, to which Sue replies ‘Yes’. John has produced a series of bodily movements which result in the production of a certain sound. Austin called such a performance a \"phonetic act\", and called the act a \"phone\". John’s utterance also conforms to the lexical and grammatical conventions of English—that is, John has produced an English sentence. Austin called this a \"phatic act\", and labels such utterances \"phemes\". John also referred to Jeff’s shirt, and to the colour red. To use a pheme with a more or less definite sense and reference is to utter a \"rheme\", and to perform a \"rhetic act\". Note that rhemes are a sub-class of phemes, which in turn are a sub-class of phones. One cannot perform a rheme without also performing a pheme and a phone. The performance of these three acts is the performance of a \"locution\"—it is the act of saying something.\n\nJohn has therefore performed a locutionary act. He has also done at least two other things. He has asked a question, and he has elicited an answer from Sue.\n\nAsking a question is an example of what Austin called an \"illocutionary act.\" Other examples would be making an assertion, giving an order, and promising to do something. To perform an illocutionary act is to use a locution with a certain force. It is an act performed \"in\" saying something, in contrast with a locution, the act \"of\" saying something.\n\nEliciting an answer is an example of what Austin calls a \"perlocutionary act\", an act performed \"by\" saying something. Notice that if one successfully performs a perlocution, one also succeeds in performing both an illocution and a locution.\n\nIn the theory of speech acts, attention has especially focused on the illocutionary act, much less on the locutionary and perlocutionary act, and only rarely on the subdivision of the locution into phone, pheme and rheme.\n\n\"How to Do Things With Words\" is based on lectures given at Oxford between 1951 and 1954, and then at Harvard in 1955.\n\nAccording to J. L. Austin, \"performative utterance\" refers to a not truth-valuable action of \"performing\", or \"doing\" a certain action. For example, when people say \"I promise to do so and so\", they are generating the action of making a promise. In this case, without any flaw (the promise is flawlessly fulfilled), the \"performative utterance\" is \"happy\", or to use J. L. Austin’s word, \"felicitous\"; if on the other hand, one fails to do what he or she promised, it can be \"unhappy\", or \"infelicitous\". Notice that performative utterance is not truth-valuable, which means nothing said can be judged based on truth or falsity. \nThere are four types of performative s according to Austin: explicit, implicit, primitive, and in explicit. \"How to Do Things With Words\", edited by J. O. Urmson and Marina Bissau, records Austin's lectures on this topic. In this book, Austin offers examples for each type of performative mentioned above. For explicit performative, he mentioned \"I apologize\", \"I criticize\" (Page 83), which are so explicit to receivers that it would not make sense for someone to ask \"Does he really mean that?\". In explicit performative are opposite, so the receiver will have understandable doubts. For primary performative, the example Austin gave is \"I shall be there\". Compared with explicit performative, there is uncertainty in implicit performative. People might ask if he or she is promising to be there with primary performative, however, this uncertainty is not strong enough as in explicit performative. Most examples given are explicit because it is easy to identify and observe, and identifying other performative requires comparison and contrast with explicit performative.\n\nIn the posthumously published \"Sense and Sensibilia\" (the title is Austin's own, and wittily echoes the title of \"Sense and Sensibility\", Jane Austen's first book, just as his name echoes hers), Austin criticizes the claims put forward by A. J. Ayer's \"The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge (1940)\", and to a lesser extent, H.H. Price’s Perception (1932) and G. J. Warnock’s Berkley (1953), concerning the sense-data theory. He states that perceptual variation, which can be attributed to physical causes, does not involve a figurative disconnect between sense and reference, due to an unreasonable separation of parts from the perceived object. Central to his argument, he shows that \"there is no one kind of thing that we ‘perceive’ but many different kinds, the number being reducible if at all by scientific investigation and not by philosophy\" (Austin 1962a, 4).\nAustin argues that Ayer fails to understand the proper function of such words as \"illusion\", \"delusion\", \"hallucination\", \"looks\", \"appears\" and \"seems\", and uses them instead in a \"special way...invented by philosophers.\" According to Austin, normally these words allow us to express reservations about our commitment to the truth of what we are saying, and that the introduction of sense-data adds nothing to our understanding of or ability to talk about what we see.\nAs an example, Austin examines the word ‘real’ and contrasts the ordinary meanings of that word based on everyday language and the ways it is used by sense-data theorists. In order to determine the meaning of ‘real’ we have to consider, case by case, the ways and contexts in which it is used. By observing that it is (i) a substantive-hungry word that is sometimes a (ii) adjuster-word, as well as a (iii) dimension-word and (iv) a word whose negative use \"wears the trousers,\" Austin highlights its complexities. Only by doing so, according to Austin, can we avoid introducing false dichotomies.\n\nAustin's papers were collected and published posthumously as \"Philosophical Papers\" by J. O. Urmson and Geoffrey Warnock. The book originally contained ten papers, two more being added in the second edition and one in the third. His paper Excuses has had a massive impact on criminal law theory.\n\nChapters 1 and 3 study how a word may have different, but related, senses. Chapters 2 and 4 discuss the nature of knowledge, focusing on performative utterance. Chapters 5 and 6 study the correspondence theory, where a statement is true when it corresponds to a fact. Chapters 6 and 10 concern the doctrine of speech acts. Chapters 8, 9, and 12 reflect on the problems that language encounters in discussing actions and considering the cases of excuses, accusations, and freedom.\n\nThis early paper contains a broad criticism of Idealism. The question set dealing with the existence of \"a priori\" concepts is treated only indirectly, by dismissing the concept of \"concept\" that underpins it.\n\nThe first part of this paper takes the form of a reply to an argument for the existence of Universals: from observing that we do use words such as \"grey\" or \"circular\" and that we use a single term in each case, it follows that there must be a \"something\" that is named by such terms—a universal. Furthermore, since each case of \"grey\" or \"circular\" is different, it follows that universals \"themselves\" cannot be sensed.\n\nAustin carefully dismantles this argument, and in the process other transcendental arguments. He points out first that universals are not \"something we stumble across\", and that they are \"defined\" by their relation to particulars. He continues by pointing out that, from the observation that we use \"grey\" and \"circular\" as if they were the names of things, it simply \"does not follow\" that there is something that is named. In the process he dismisses the notion that \"words are essentially proper names\", asking \"...why, if 'one identical' word is used, \"must\" there be 'one identical object' present which it denotes\".\n\nIn the second part of the article, he generalizes this argument against universals to address concepts as a whole. He points out that it is \"facile\" to treat concepts as if they were \"an article of property\". Such questions as \"Do we possess such-and-such a concept\" and \"how do we come to possess such-and-such a concept\" are meaningless, because concepts are not the sort of thing that one possesses.\n\nIn the final part of the paper, Austin further extends the discussion to relations, presenting a series of arguments to reject the idea that there is some \"thing\" that is a relation. His argument likely follows from the conjecture of his colleague, S. V. Tezlaf, who questioned what makes \"this\" \"that\".\n\n\"The Meaning of a Word\" is a polemic against doing philosophy by attempting to pin down the \"meaning\" of the words used, arguing that 'there is \"no\" simple and handy appendage of a word called \"the meaning of the word (x)\"'.\n\nAustin warns us to take care when removing words from their ordinary usage, giving numerous examples of how this can lead to error.\n\nIn \"Other Minds\", one of his most highly acclaimed pieces, Austin criticizes the method that philosophers have used since Descartes to analyze and verify statements of the form \"That person S feels X.\" This method works from the following three assumptions:\n\n\nAlthough Austin agrees with (2), quipping that \"we should be in a pretty predicament if I did\", he found (1) to be false and (3) to be therefore unnecessary. The background assumption to (1), Austin claims, is that if I say that I know X and later find out that X is false, I did not know it. Austin believes that this is not consistent with the way we actually use language. He claims that if I was in a position where I would normally say that I know X, if X should turn out to be false, I would be speechless rather than self-corrective. He gives an argument that this is so by suggesting that believing is to knowing as intending is to promising— knowing and promising are the speech-act versions of believing and intending respectively.\n\n\"A Plea for Excuses\" is both a demonstration by example, and a defense of the methods of ordinary language philosophy, which proceeds on the conviction that:\n\"...our common stock of words embodies all the distinctions men have found worth drawing, and the connections they have found worth marking, in the lifetime of many generations: these surely are likely to be more numerous, more sound, since they have stood up to the long test of survival of the fittest, and more subtle, at least in all ordinary and reasonable practical matters, than any that you or I are likely to think up in our armchair of an afternoon—the most favourite alternative method.\"\n\nAn example of such a distinction Austin describes in a footnote is that between the phrases \"by mistake\" and \"by accident\". Although their uses are similar, Austin argues that with the right examples we can see that a distinction exists in when one or the other phrase is appropriate.\n\nAustin proposes some curious philosophical tools. For instance, he uses a sort of word game for developing an understanding of a key concept. This involves taking up a dictionary and finding a selection of terms relating to the key concept, then looking up each of the words in the explanation of their meaning. This process is iterated until the list of words begins to repeat, closing in a \"family circle\" of words relating to the key concept.\n\nAustin occupies a place in philosophy of language alongside the Cantabrigian Wittgenstein and Austin's fellow Oxonian, Gilbert Ryle, in staunchly advocating the examination of the way words are ordinarily \"used\" in order to elucidate meaning and by this means avoid philosophical confusions. Unlike many ordinary language philosophers, however, Austin disavowed any overt indebtedness to Wittgenstein's later philosophy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Civil disorder is a breakdown of civil society, and may be a form of protest. It may take various forms, such as illegal parades, sit-ins, riots, sabotage, and other forms of crime.\n\nRandomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events.\n\nAntinomianism, in Christianity, is a theological position which takes the principle of salvation by faith and divine grace to the point of asserting that the saved are not bound to follow the Law of Moses.\n\n"}
{"id": "1963923", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1963923", "title": "Legal informatics", "text": "Legal informatics\n\nLegal informatics is an area within information science. Erdelez and O'Hare (1997) define legal informatics as follows:\n\nAdvances in technology and legal informatics have led to new models for the delivery of legal services. Legal services have traditionally been a \"bespoke\" product created by a professional attorney on an individual basis for each client. However, to work more efficiently, parts of these services will move sequentially from (1) bespoke to (2) standardized, (3) systematized, (4) packaged, and (5) commoditized. Moving from one stage to the next will require embracing different technologies and knowledge systems.\n\nThe widespread introduction of cloud computing provides several benefits in delivering legal services. Legal service providers can use the Software as a Service model to earn a profit by charging customers a per-use or subscription fee. This model has several benefits over traditional bespoke services.\n\nSoftware as a service also complicates the attorney-client relationship in a way that may have implications for attorney-client privilege. The traditional delivery model makes it easy to create delineations of when attorney-client privilege attaches and when it does not. But in more complex models of legal service delivery other actors or automated processes may moderate the relationship between a client and their attorney making it difficult to tell which communications should be legally privileged.\n\nBecause the traditional model for delivery services demanded all legal work to be done in a bespoke manner the supply of legal services is generally inelastic. Households that are ineligible for legal aid but are not able to easily afford bespoke legal services are effectively underserved by the traditional model. A report by the American Bar Association Standing Committee on the Delivery of Legal Services found that \"among moderate-income households, 39% used the legal system to attempt resolution of their legal problems, 23% attempted resolution without legal help, and 26% took no action.\" New organizations seek to access this under-served latent market by using technology to reduce prices and make services more available.\n\nThe spread of the Internet and development of legal technology and informatics are extending legal services to individuals and small-medium companies.\n\nIn 1995, FindLaw started its online legal information service, where users can search lawyers, discuss legal topics in open forum, and purchase legal forms. In 1999, LegalMatch started its online legal matching service, where users answer questions online, LegalMatch identify the service required and notifies relevant lawyers, and users receives responses from the lawyers and can decide whom to hire. In 2001, LegalZoom started its online legal documentation service. At LegalZoom, users can create legal documents for personal and business use by answering a questionnaire online and purchase the completed document. In 2008, Rocket Lawyer started its online legal service, where users can receive legal documentation service and the on-call service to consult lawyers for personal and business needs at monthly or annual subscription fee. In 2012, Shake started its mobile legal documentation service, with which users can create simple legal agreements via a mobile app.\n\nIn 2005, Taichiro Motoe, an attorney at law qualified in Japan, founded Authense Group, Inc. and started its online legal service, Bengoshi.com. At Bengoshi.com, users can search lawyers, ask legal questions and receive answers from lawyers in open forum, request estimate for attorney fees, and consult lawyers for personal and business needs.\n\nCurrently available legal technologies and processes cannot be implemented due to various regulations on the practice of law put into place by state bar associations and state statutes. There is controversy over whether these regulations remain in place due to economic interests by attorneys or out of genuine concern for potential harms to customers. Regulations which pose obstacles to widespread adoption of new legal technologies and processes include unauthorized practice of law statutes, ethical rules restricting alternative business structures for law firms, and professional rules which make practicing law in multiple jurisdictions difficult.\n\nLay organizations seeking to provide legal services must be careful to avoid committing unauthorized practice of law or face exposure to litigation from consumers and regulators. The definition of what constitutes unauthorized practice of law is nebulous and has been criticized as a potentially unconstitutional restriction on free speech.\n\nIn the United States a complete bar to nonlawyer ownership has been adopted by the American Bar Association as paragraph (d) of Rule 5.4 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct and has been codified in one form or another in all U.S. jurisdictions, except the District of Columbia. Because of these rules, law firms face additional difficulties in raising equity capital to finance development of their own legal technologies and additional regulatory requirements compared to layperson organizations. Outside of the United States there are several countries which have allowed nonlawyer ownership of law firms ranging from limitations on percentage ownership combined with a \"fit to own\" test (as in the United Kingdom) to allowing passive equity investment in law firms (as in Australia).\n\nRule 5.5 of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct requires that attorneys who maintain a \"systematic and continuous practice\" in a jurisdiction be admitted to practice in that jurisdiction. For law firms that wish to provide legal services over online delivery platforms, this phrase is unclear as to what types of activities within a state require licensing in that state. This difficulty is especially acute for virtual law firms.\n\nFrom the mid-1990s onwards, lawyers, developers and publishers began to make the law available via the world wide web. Particularly influential was the Free Access to Law Movement which by 2014 had 54 national and regional member organizations. In 2002, FALM adopted the Declaration on Free Access to Law. The goal of the movement has been to ensure that legal information is freely available to everyone. The declaration declared public legal information to be the common heritage of mankind.\n\nThe member organizations of FALM, primarily through the Internet, engaged in widespread publication of primary and secondary legal information. Early examples include the Legal Information Institute at Cornell University Law School and the Australasian Legal Information Institute based at the University of Technology and the University of New South Wales. The latter involved early adoption of hypertext technology to represent laws as a network of nodes, each representing a section.\n\nWork of the open access to law movement is now published through the \"Journal of Open Access to Law\", which was established in 2013.\n\nThe work of the movement provided a catalyst for increasing official open access publication of legal information online by government agencies themselves.\n\nLawyers, designers, and computers scientists have considered ways to use technology to improve non-lawyers' access to justice.\n\nIllinois Institute of Technology (IIT's) Institute of Design and the Chicago-Kent College of Law collaborated on a multi-year redesign of self-represented litigants' court experience. Their 2002 report documented their investigation of current assistance systems, creation of a new design protocol, and plan for a new system design. The report also puts forward a number of concept designs, reimagining how the court system may work and people may access it. Some of their proposals include:\n\nThe Berkman Center at Harvard Law School has been working with Massachusetts housing court judge Dina Fein to design access to civil justice in the state for pro se litigants, low-income people, litigants who aren't proficient in English, and people with disabilities.\n\nCodeX, the Stanford Center for Legal Informatics, hosts projects such as Legal.io and Ravel Law, addressing the application of legal informatics to access to justice issues, and convenes a community bringing researchers, lawyers, entrepreneurs and technologists together to work side-by-side to advance the frontier of legal technology.\n\nLaw and policy issues in legal informatics stem from the use of informational technologies in the implementation of law, such as the use of subpoenas for information found in email, search queries, and social networks. Policy approaches to legal informatics issues vary throughout the world; for example, European countries tend to require destruction or anonymization of data so that it cannot be used for discovery.\n\nCopyright holders make use of digital rights management (DRM) technology to limit the use and distribution of digital content. In the United States, the anti-circumvention provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) criminalizes attempts to circumvent DRM, even in cases where the circumvention is merely to facilitate non-infringing uses of the content. Along with the anti-circumvention provision, DRM can override substantive rights, such as fair use.\n\nWithin the practice issues conceptual area, progress continues to be made on both litigation and transaction focused technologies. In particular, technology including predictive coding has the potential to effect substantial efficiency gains in law practice. Though predictive coding has largely been applied in the litigation space, it is beginning to make inroads in transaction practice, where it is being used to improve document review in mergers and acquisitions. Other advances, including XML coding in transaction contracts, and increasingly advanced document preparation systems demonstrate the importance of legal informatics in the transactional law space.\n\nArtificial intelligence is already employed in online dispute resolution platforms that use optimization algorithms and blind-bidding, and may be employed extensively in the future. Artificial intelligence is also frequently employed in modeling the legal ontology, \"an explicit, formal, and general specification of a conceptualization of properties of and relations between objects in a given domain\".\n\nBoth academic and proprietary quantitative legal prediction models exist. One of the earliest examples of a working quantitative legal prediction model occurred in the form of the Supreme Court forecasting project. The Supreme Court forecasting model attempted to predict the results of all the cases on the 2002 term of the Supreme Court. The model predicted 75% of cases correctly compared to experts who only predicted 59.1% of cases.\nAnother example of an academic quantitative legal prediction models is a 2012 model that predicted the result of Federal Securities class action lawsuits.\nAlso there are legal technology startups that are attempting to create proprietary models to predict case outcomes; one example is Lex Machina, a company that provides intellectual property data and analytics.\n\nIn 1995, Peter W. Martin's paper for the NCAIR Sponsored Program on the Future of Legal Information Technology, entitled \"Digital Law: Some Speculations on the Future of Legal Information Technology\", wondered how innovations in technology were shaping—and would shape—legal information flow, storage, and organization. In other words, Martin was wondering how technology would change the fundamental nature and practice of the legal field in the United States. Martin wrote that \"There is a powerful (but infrequently noticed) linkage between ways societies think about law and the technology they use in operation and distribution of it (law that is).\"\n\nMartin was writing shortly after launching the Legal Information Institute at Cornell, the first law server on the Internet. LEXIS had pioneered putting digital legal content on computers twenty-four years prior, and digital content then accounted for more than 50% of the legal information market. Martin asked readers to suspend their disbelief as he proposed relatively rapid shifts in the ratio of paper-based legal information to digital legal information; the power wielded by the information-seeking public vs. high-priced gatekeepers of legal information; and a shift away from the private sector as a means to basic legal data and towards more higher-level skill sets.\n\nMartin suggested \"fuller\" bodies of data, pointing to a case in which the court thoroughly discussed a restaurant's trademark decor without ever showing a picture of the decor. Martin also highlights the Penalty Statistics Database in use in sentencing in New South Wales, and comparing it to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines of the United States. The South Wales model, launched in 1990, allows judges access not only to both more traditional legal data, including statutory provisions and appellate decisions but also to the availability of alternate facilities (such as drug rehabilitation programs). The \"Penalty Statistics Database\" furthermore gives judges access to a pre-analyzed data pool of sentencing decisions made by other sentencing officers in New South Wales, as well as full offense and offender information. In this suggestion, too, Martin emphasizes the Penalty Statistics Database's use of graphical display to make the information it is transmitting to judges easier to access and utilize.\n\nTreating legal informatics as a field as a serious tool for changing the way people interact with the law may pave the way for radical innovations in areas of law that are seen as inherently static, top-down, and bureaucratic.\n\nToday's corporate legal departments are entities which can be as large as the biggest law firms. As such, the usage of different legal informatics technologies is important for their success. Legal departments use among other: various technology aids to manage their document databases, and more advanced assets such as patent portfolios. Some legal departments are also experimenting with the automation of certain types of tasks performed by in-house attorneys in their day-to-day practice. These tasks include: preparation of documents, editing and customization of these documents and the management of signatures.\n\nThe prevailing corporate governance paradigm, especially when public companies are concerned, is largely based on the notion of the relative efficiency of separating ownership and control in managing business corporations. However, technological change can affect the equilibrium of optimal governance structure for individual firms. For instance, by lowering the cost of both disseminating information to shareholders and gathering data about their preferences, developments in communication technology can potentially make it preferable for some firms to organize the management of the firm in a manner more similar to, for example, direct democracy, with features such as two-way communication between the company's senior management and its investors. The study of such questions thus applies legal informatics to analyzing the relationship between technology and corporate governance structures.\n\n"}

Legal Tech companies are generally startups founded with the purpose of disrupting the traditionally conservative legal market. According to TechCrunch, as of December 2014, \"legal technology is booming, with companies attempting to disrupt the legal space at every level and from every angle\" and Forbes noted in February 2015 that there were “hundreds of legal startups popping up all over the US and Europe”.\n\nLegal technology traditionally referred to the application of technology and software to help law firms with practice management, document storage, billing, accounting and electronic discovery. Since 2011, Legal Tech has evolved to be associated more with technology startups disrupting the practice of law by giving people access to online software that reduces or in some cases eliminates the need to consult a lawyer, or by connecting people with lawyers more efficiently through online marketplaces and lawyer-matching websites.\n\nThe legal industry is widely seen to be conservative and traditional, with Law Technology Today noting that \"in 50 years, the customer experience at most law firms has barely changed\". Reasons for this include the fact law firms face weaker cost-cutting incentives than other professions (since they pass disbursements directly to their client) and are seen to be risk averse (as a minor technological error could have significant financial consequences for a client).\n\nHowever, the growth of the hiring by businesses of in-house counsel and their increasing sophistication, together with the development of email, has led to clients placing increasing cost and time pressure on their lawyers. In addition, there are increasing incentives for lawyers to become technologically competent, with the American Bar Association voting in August 2012 to amend the Model Rules of Professional Conduct to require lawyers to keep abreast of \"the benefits and risks associated with relevant technology\", and the saturation of the market leading many lawyers to look for cutting-edge ways to compete. The exponential growth in the volume of documents (mostly email) that must be reviewed for litigation cases has greatly accelerated the adoption of technology used in eDiscovery, with elements of machine language and artificial intelligence being incorporated and cloud-based services being adopted by law firms.\n\nInvestment in Legal Tech is predominantly focused in the United States with more than $254 million invested in 2014 in the United States, however there is significant growth worldwide.\n\nStanford Law School has started CodeX, the Center for Legal Informatics, an interdisciplinary research center, which also incubates companies started by law students and computer scientists. Some companies that have come out of the program include Lex Machina and Legal.io.\n\nTraditional areas of Legal Tech include:\n\nMore recent areas of growth in Legal Tech focus on:\n\nLegal research:\n\n\nSeed round:\nSeries A and beyond:\n\nOther legal technology companies:\n\n"}

Established in the early 19th century around a foundry built by its namesake, John Loy, over subsequent decades the community's location along State Highway 61 helped it grow into a trading center for local farmers. By the time the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) began making plans to build Norris Dam in the early 1930s, Loyston had a population of approximately 70 residents, and consisted of a post office and several small businesses.\n\nPrior to inundation, TVA conducted extensive sociological surveys of Loyston's residents, and the community was documented by photographer Lewis Hine. Most of Loyston's residents relocated elsewhere in the area, with many forming the community of New Loyston in the hills to the south. Loyston was located near where Mill Creek empties into the Clinch River, at river mile 98. Mill Creek's drainage carved a broad valley known as Big Valley, flanked on the south by Lone Mountain and on the east by Big Ridge. At Loyston, State Highway 61 intersected a major local road. The trip to Knoxville from Loyston was a drive on Highway 61 (which has since been re-routed).\n\nLoyston is now under a mile-wide section of Norris Lake known as the \"Loyston Sea,\" located along the shores of Big Ridge State Park.\n\nIn the 1780s, German immigrant Henry Sharp built a frontier fort known as \"Sharp's Station\" on the slopes of Big Ridge overlooking the Clinch River east of Loyston, the area having been identified by long hunters travelling down the Clinch Valley during the previous decade. In 1933, Sharp's descendants were still prominent members of the Loyston community, evidenced by names such as \"Sharp's Station Methodist Episcopal Church,\" which was located just outside Loyston. Another notable early settler, Robert Stooksbury, moved to the Loyston area around 1800. Several dozen of Stooksbury's descendants were still living in the Loyston area in the early 1930s, some of whom operated one of the community's general stores. \nIn the early 19th century, John Loy established a foundry in the area, taking advantage of the iron ore deposits at the base of Big Ridge. The community that developed around the foundry was known variously as \"Loy\" and \"Loy's Crossroads.\" When a post office was established in the community in 1866, it took the name \"Loy's Cross Roads,\" but the name was changed to Loyston in 1894.\n\nBy the early 1930s, when TVA agents were surveying the Clinch River Valley for the Norris Dam Project, Loyston consisted of a post office, two general stores, a filling station, a cafe, a mill, and a barbershop. A Delco Light system provided electricity to Loyston's businesses and a few of its houses. TVA and the University of Tennessee Department of Agriculture's extension service helped Loyston families relocate, driving them to farms for sale around the region (one Loyston family required 25 such trips before finding a farm that satisfied them). CCC Company 4495, which built Big Ridge State Park, was headquartered at Loyston.\n\nTVA's studies showed that most residents of the Norris Basin were living in relative poverty, although Loyston's residents fared better due to better farm land. The Stooksbury general store had sales of $50,000 per year, resulting in a $7,000 profit. Houses in the Loyston area ranged from primitive two-room log cabins to eight-room frame houses. Most houses were heated by fireplaces, although some had coal-burning stoves. Loyston's children attended either Loyston Elementary School or the nearby one-room Oakdale School.\n\nTVA agents discussed in depth with Loyston's residents the benefits of moving to more fertile lands in the lower parts of the valley, and were perplexed when most of the community's residents chose to move no further than the less lucrative adjacent hill country. In an attempt to keep the community intact, many of the displaced residents established New Loyston a few miles to the south. A significant number moved to Knoxville, and others moved to nearby Anderson County or to Blount or Loudon counties south of Knoxville.\n\nThe valley in which Loyston was once located is now submerged under the widest part of Norris Lake, the mile-wide \"Loyston Sea.\" While building the Norris reservoir, TVA engineers determined that a saddle dam would be necessary to prevent water from the Mill Creek embayment from escaping into the Buffalo Creek Valley (which empties into the Clinch downstream from Norris Dam). This saddle dam, known as the \"Loyston Dike,\" is located along Highway 61 just west of Big Ridge State Park. A recreation area along the Mill Creek embayment has also been named for Loyston. In 2008, the Museum of Appalachia accepted a donation of a children's playhouse that originally stood in Loyston and was said to be the last intact building from the community.\n\n"}

He was the husband of Aung San Suu Kyi, the current State Counsellor of Myanmar.\n\nAris was born in Havana, Cuba. His mother, Josette Aris (née Vaillancourt), was the Canadian Ambassador's daughter, and his English father, John Aris, was an officer with the British Council.\n\nAfter being educated at Worth School in Sussex and upon completing his degree in modern history at St Cuthbert's Society, Durham University in 1967, Aris spent six years as the private tutor of the children of the royal family of the Himalayan Kingdom of Bhutan.\n\nAris was an academic and lecturer in Asian history at St John's College and later at St Antony's College, Oxford. In the last years before his death, he helped to establish a specialist Tibetan and Himalayan Studies centre at Oxford.\n\nMichael Aris's identical twin brother, Anthony Aris, similarly became a scholar of Tibetan studies, and founded \"Serindia Publications\" to focus on bringing Tibetan history and culture to modern audiences.\n\nIn 1972, Aris married Aung San Suu Kyi, whom he had met while at the university. They married in a Buddhist ceremony. After spending a year in Bhutan, they settled in North Oxford, where they raised their two sons, Alexander Aris and Kim Aris. During this time, he did postgraduate studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London and obtained a PhD in Tibetan literature in 1978. In 1988, Aung San Suu Kyi returned to Burma at first to care for her mother but later to lead the country's pro-democracy movement. St John's College provided Aris with an extended leave of absence as a fellow on full stipend so that he could lobby for his wife's cause.\n\nIn 1997, Aris was diagnosed with prostate cancer which was later found to be terminal. Several countries, prominent individuals and organisations, including the United States government, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Pope John Paul II, made appeals to the Burmese authorities to allow Dr Aris a visa. The Burmese government would not grant him a visa to visit Burma, saying that they did not have the facilities to care for him, and instead urged Aung San Suu Kyi to leave the country to visit him. She was at that time temporarily free from house arrest but was unwilling to depart, fearing that she would be refused re-entry if she left, as she did not trust the junta's assurance that she could return.\n\nAris died of prostate cancer on his 53rd birthday in 1999, in Oxford. After 1989, when his wife was first placed under house arrest, he had seen her only five times, the last of which was for Christmas in 1995, after Suu Kyi had been released for the first time.\n\n"}

The association’s mission is to provide leadership on rural health issues, which it attempts to carry out through education, communication, and advocacy. The NRHA membership is made up of a diverse collection of individuals and organizations, all of whom share the common bond of an interest in rural health. Many member organizations have specific facility designations such as critical access hospitals, rural health clinics, or community health centers.\n\nIn the mid to late 1970s, a small group of rural community health centers began to coalesce around the need for an independent association to make sure the rural-specific needs of the community health center movement was represented. In 1978, the National Rural Primary Care Association (NRPCA) was founded and based in Waterville, Maine The NRPCA would move its headquarters to Kansas City, Missouri in 1983, where it remains to this day.\n\nIn the early 1980s two additional rural health associations were formed with similar desires to represent the rural-specific needs within their larger professional groups. The American Rural Health Association (ARHA) was formed in 1980 primarily made up of rural health researchers. The goal of the ARHA was to \"become a definitive source of information on rural health.\" In February 1981, the American Small and Rural Hospital Association (ASRHA) was formed.\n\nIn 1984, the Board of the NRPCA changed the association's name to the National Rural Health Care Association (NRHCA). In doing so, the association moved past its mainly community health center roots and allowed other providers as segments of its membership. This change prepared the way for the NRHCA to eventually merge with both the ARHA and the ASRHA. These mergers took place in 1987 and 1986, respectively. These mergers led to a change of the name to the National Rural Health Association, a \"new unified voice for rural health.\"\n\nNRHA' roots in professional-specific rural organizations has led to a membership structure that contains specific constituency groups for different rural health interests. These associations within an association each have seats on the NRHA board of trustees and its policy setting body. Many also have their own conference or tracks within larger NRHA conferences.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21938624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21938624", "title": "Oral storytelling", "text": "Oral storytelling\n\nOral storytelling is an ancient and intimate tradition between the storyteller and their audience. The storyteller and the listeners are physically close, often seated together in a circular fashion. Through the telling of the story people become psychically close, developing a connection to one another through the communal experience. The storyteller reveals, and thus shares, him/her self through his/her telling and the listeners reveal and share themselves through their reception of the story. The intimacy and connection is deepened by the flexibility of oral storytelling which allows the tale to be moulded according to the needs of the audience and/or the location or environment of the telling. Listeners also experience the urgency of a creative process taking place in their presence and they experience the empowerment of being a part of that creative process. Storytelling creates a personal bond with the teller and the audience.\n\nThe flexibility of oral storytelling extends to the teller. Each teller will incorporate their own personality and may choose to add characters into the story. As a result, there will be numerous variations of a single story. Some tellers consider anything outside the narrative as extraneous while other storytellers choose to enhance their telling of the tale with the addition of visual and audio tools, specific actions and creative strategies and devices.\n\nStorytelling may be performed in many forms: in prose, in poetic form, as a song, accompanied with dance or some kind of theatrical performance, etc.\n\nIt is likely that oral storytelling has been around as long as human language. Storytelling fulfills the need for human beings to cast their experiences in narrative form. Our ancestors probably gathered around the evening fires and expressed their fears, their beliefs and their heroism through oral narratives. This long tradition of storytelling is evident in ancient cultures such as the Australian Aborigines. Community storytelling offered the security of explanation; how life and its many forms began and why things happen, as well as entertainment and enchantment. Communities were strengthened and maintained through stories that connected the present, the past and the future.\n\nTelling stories is a nurturing act for the listener, who is connected to the storyteller through the story, as well as for the storyteller who is connected to the listeners through the story.\n\nEarly storytelling probably originates in simple chants . People sang chants as they worked at grinding corn or sharpening tools. Our early ancestors created myths to explain natural occurrences. They assigned superhuman qualities to ordinary people, thus originating the hero tale.\n\nEarly storytelling combined stories, poetry, music, and dance. Those who excelled at storytelling became entertainers, educators, cultural advisors, and historians for the community. Through storytellers, the history of a culture was handed down from generation to generation.\n\nThe importance of stories and storytellers throughout human history can be seen in the respect afforded to professional storytellers.\n\nThe 9th century fictional storyteller Scheherazade of \"One Thousand and One Nights\", who saves herself from execution by telling tales, is one example illustrating the value placed on storytelling in days of old. Centuries before Scheherazade, the power of storytelling is reflected by Vyasa at the beginning of the Indian epic \"Mahabharata\". Vyasa says, \"If you listen carefully, at the end you'll be someone else.\"\n\nIn the Middle Ages storytellers, also called a troubadour or a minstrel, could be seen in the market places and were honored as members of royal courts. Medieval storytellers were expected to know all the current tales and in the words of American storyteller Ruth Sawyer, ‘to repeat all the noteworthy theses from the universities, to be well informed on court scandal, to know the healing power of herbs and simples (medicines), to be able to compose verses to a lord or lady at a moment's notice, and to play on at least two of the instruments then in favor at court.’ According to some writers there were 426 minstrels employed at the wedding of Princess Margaret of England in 1290. Two of the storytellers of the court of King Edward I were two women who performed under the names of Matill Makejoye and Pearl in the Egg.\n\nJourneying from land to land, storytellers would learn various regions's stories while also gathering news to bring back with them. Through exchanging stories with other storytellers, stories changed, making it difficult to trace the origins of many stories.\n\nIn the 1800s Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm collected and published stories that had been told orally in Germany. They did not publish them as they found them however, but edited them in accordance with their own values. Like the Grimm brothers in Germany, Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jorgen Moe collected Norwegian folk tales. In Denmark Hans Christian Andersen adapted folktales he heard from oral storytellers. In England, Joseph Jacobs recorded collections of folktales of England, Scotland, Wales.\n\nIn the 1900s the importance of oral storytelling was recognised by storytellers such as Marie Shedlock, a retired English schoolteacher. She made several tours to the United States to lecture on the art of storytelling emphasising the importance of storytelling as a natural way to introduce literature to children.\n\n\nIn the 20th century oral storytelling has undergone a revival of interest and focus. Including the establishment of a number of storytelling festivals beginning with the National Storytelling Festival (USA) in Jonesborough, TN. \n\nRegional storytelling festivals bring tellers of a certain state or region together for entertaining, telling and education in the art.\n\n\n\n"}

Through advocacy initiatives, educational programs, architectural resources, and cultural events, the foundation’s goal is to encourage the community to learn about and save the historic buildings that make the town of Palm Beach special.\n\nFounded in 1981, the organization is committed to honoring and preserving Palm Beach’s original architectural treasures and public spaces. Honorable Judge James R. Knott, a dedicated historian and author, facilitated the establishment of the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach. It has lobbied local and county government to change policy and enact legislation that directly and legally protects Palm Beach’s architectural assets. The buildings and styles of Mizner, Wyeth, Fatio, and Volk are as unique as they are important to the overall character and charm of the town. The organization not only encourages education and appreciation for these historical structures, but also works against the forces of speculation, development, and degradation to ensure they remain a vital part of the community. The restoration, rehabilitation, and conservation of historic structures and public spaces can spur economic and cultural development.\n\nThe organization has been able to save the town’s oldest house (Sea Gull Cottage), restore the historic Town Hall, create the Earl E.T. Smith Preservation Park, establish a heritage education program for fourth grade school children, restore the Little Red Schoolhouse (the oldest one-room school in Southeast Florida that offers a living history program under its roof), and create Pan’s Garden in the heart of the town that offers educational programs about native plants and butterflies. Town-owned open space has also been safeguarded, as well as neighborhood zoning strengthened and upheld through the efforts of preservationists. Facade easement donations to the foundation help protect buildings, as well as bring tax savings to owners. Millions of dollars have gone to purchase property, as well as into restoration and rehabilitation over the years.\n\nSeveral awards are offered to encourage preserving of the historic, architectural, and cultural heritage:\n\n\nIn 1987, the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach introduced its Heritage Education Program. The goal is to teach children about the history and culture of Palm Beach through its local architecture and cultural artifacts. The program’s workshops are currently offered in several public and private schools in or near the Town of Palm Beach.\n\nSince 1990, Palm Beach county teachers have participated in teacher training workshops sponsored by the foundation. These sessions are designed to instruct teachers how to create local heritage education programs in their schools. In 1993, the Florida Trust for Historic Preservation presented The Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach its Outstanding Achievement Award in Education for the Heritage Education Program.\n\nThe organization's Archives and Library exist to sustain the mission of the foundation by collecting, preserving, organizing, and encouraging use of its historical documents and research materials. Maintained are a collection of books, historic documents, resource materials and photographs dealing with architecture, Palm Beach, Florida history, historic preservation, as well as horticulture and landscape architecture. Housed in the foundation’s headquarters, the archives and library have resources that are available to the community.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "498582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=498582", "title": "Procatalepsis", "text": "Procatalepsis\n\nProcatalepsis, also called prolepsis or prebuttal, is a figure of speech in which the speaker raises an objection to their own argument and then immediately answers it. By doing so, they hope to strengthen their argument by dealing with possible counter-arguments before their audience can raise them.\n\nIn rhetoric anticipating future responses and answering possible objections will set up one's argument for a strong defense. The \"Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism\" states that there are three distinct theoretical uses of prolepsis: argumentation, literary discussion, and conjunction with narratological analyses of the order of events.\n\nIn argumentation, procatalepsis is used to answer the opponent's possible objections before they can be made. In literary discussion, procatalepsis is used as a figure of speech in which a description is used before it is strictly applicable. Sayings such as \"I'm a dead man\" exemplify the suggestion of a state that has not yet occurred. In narratological analyses prolepsis can be used with the order of events and presentation of events in texts. This refers to the study of narrative in respect to \"flash-forwards\" in which a future event serves as an interruption of the present time of the text.\n\nExample:\n\nAs a linguistic phenomenon found in both classic and current languages, prolepsis is described as the construction whereby the subject of a subordinate clause occurs by anticipation as an object in the main clause. Although this definition is strictly technical as used in linguistics, it has also been used to describe the more general phenomenon of objects or phrases appearing earlier than intended or expected. \n\nProcatalepsis as a rhetorical technique is also related to and used in other forms and techniques. A hypophora is described as a figure of speech in which a speaker raises a question then immediately answers it. Since these questions are often raised as possible dissenting opinions or audience objections, the hypophora can be said to be a use of procatalepsis.\n\nThe Straw Man argument, an informal fallacy in which one misrepresents an opposing argument in order to further one's own, can serve as an example of misused procatalepsis. In this fallacy, the rhetor misconstrues the words, arguments, or views of an opponent, most often on purpose, to facilitate rebuttal or create a false impression on the audience. This, in effect, creates a \"straw man\" against which the rhetor will then defend and strengthen his or her argument. \n\nThe correct use of procatalepsis is still an effective tactic in an argument, since it allows the rhetor to answer opponents before they have a chance to raise the counterargument themselves. This \"inoculation\" can be subtle, but also signaled rather obviously (e.g. \"Now, my opponent might argue that X. But, as you can see, Y\"). The unique benefit to this more overt approach is twofold: The rhetor successfully replies to an opposing argument or audience objection, but also builds a sort of trust and authority with the audience. Then, if the opponent does in fact bring up the argument that the rhetor anticipated, the rhetor appears to be correct not only in the subject matter of the argument but in the general course of the argument itself.\n\nProcatalepsis is linked to the rhetorical term inoculation. The \"Encyclopedia of Communication Theory\" describes this rhetorical technique in relation to its medical definition: introducing small doses of viruses to the body in order to build up immunization. In rhetoric, the small dose of the threat parallels to the awareness of the opposing argument that is used to build up one's argument by defense in prolepsis. William McGuire proposed the Inoculation Theory in 1964 to challenge attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that make an argument more resistant when exposed to counter views in weakened, small doses. Persuasion research in the 1950s found that providing two sides of an issue created a greater resistance to later arguments. This is closely related to the rhetorical use of procatalepsis as an opposing argument to defend the intended view of the argument.\n\nInoculation and procatalepsis are both present in certain courtroom situations, as described in the \"Encyclopedia of Communication Theory\". An attorney may set up their defense by disclaiming the negative views or classifications of the accused as untrue: \"The prosecutor will call Ms. Jones evil, a bad mother, and a poor member of society, but these labels are not true. I will prove to you their inaccuracy.\" When the prosecutor asserts an attack on Ms. Jones' character, the jury is already prepared and expecting to hear it and they may question or even discount these accusations. The goal is not to overwhelm the audience members with anticipation or the opposing view of the argument, but rather to use the inverse argument to one's advantage through strategic rhetoric.\n"}

It was echoed, among others, by Sigmund Neumann in his book \"The Future in Perspective\" (1946). In 1948 British Prime Minister Winston Churchill gave the idea a boost when, in the first paragraph of the Preface to \"The Gathering Storm\" (1948), he says his books will \"cover an account of another Thirty Years War\".\n\nAs point in fact, major European conflicts during this period included: Balkan Wars (1912–13), World War I (1914–18), Russian Civil War (1917–23), Ukrainian–Soviet War (1917–21), Polish–Soviet War (1919–21), Spanish Civil War (1936–39) and World War II (1939–45). In addition the Interwar period saw significant levels of civilian and labor conflict as well as colonial wars.\n\n"}

{"id": "38668597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38668597", "title": "State capture", "text": "State capture\n\nState capture is a type of systemic political corruption in which private interests significantly influence a state's decision-making processes to their own advantage.\n\nThe term 'state capture' was first used by the World Bank (c 2000) to describe the situation in central Asian countries making the transition from Soviet communism. Specifically it was applied to situations where small corrupt groups used their influence over government officials to appropriate government decision making in order to strengthen their own economic positions; these groups would later become known as oligarchs.\n\nAllegations of state capture have led to protests against the government in Bulgaria in 2013-2014 and Romania in 2017, and have caused an ongoing controversy in South Africa beginning in 2016.\n\nThe classical definition of state capture refers to the way formal procedures (such as laws and social norms) and government bureaucracy are manipulated by private individuals and firms so as to influence state policies and laws in their favour. State capture seeks to influence the formation of laws to protect and promote influential private interests. In this way it differs from most other forms of corruption which instead seek selective enforcement of already existing laws.\n\nState capture may not be illegal, depending on determination by the captured state itself, and might be attempted through private lobbying and influence. The influence may be through a range of state institutions, including the legislature, executive, ministries and the judiciary, or through a corrupt electoral process. It is similar to regulatory capture but differs in the scale and variety of influenced areas and, unlike regulatory capture, the private influence is never overt. The private influences cannot be discovered by lawful processes, since the legislative process, judiciary, electoral process, and/or executive powers have been subverted.\n\nA distinguishing factor from corruption is that, while in cases of corruption the outcome (of policy or regulatory decision) is not certain, in cases of state capture the outcome is known and is highly likely to be beneficial to the captors of the state.\n\nAlso, in cases of corruption (even rampant) there is plurality and competition of 'corruptors' to influence the outcome of the policy or distribution of resources. However, in state capture, decision-makers are usually more in a position of agents to the principals (captors) who function either in monopolistic or oligopolistic (non-competitive) fashion.\n\nProtests in Bulgaria in 2013–14 against the Oresharski cabinet were prompted by allegations that it came to power due to the actions of an oligarchic structure (formerly allied to Boyko Borisov) which used underhand manouevres to discredit the GERB party.\n\nInstances where politics have been ostensibly deformed by the power of drug barons in Colombia and Mexico are also considered as examples of state capture.\n\nIn 2016 there were allegations of an overly close and potentially corrupt relationship between the wealthy Gupta family and the South African president Jacob Zuma, his family and leading members of the African National Congress (ANC). South African Opposition parties have made claims of \"State Capture\" following allegations that the Guptas, said to be close to President Jacob Zuma, his family and other ANC leaders, had insinuated themselves into a position where they could offer Cabinet positions and influence the running of government. These allegations were made in light of revelations by former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor and Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas that they had been offered Cabinet positions by the Guptas at the family's home in Saxonwold, Johannesburg.\n\nMentor claimed that in 2010 the Guptas had offered her the position of Minister of Public Enterprises, provided that she arranged for South African Airways to drop their India route, allowing a Gupta linked company (Jet Airways) to take on the route. She said she declined the offer, which occurred at the Guptas' Saxonwold residence, while President Zuma was in another room. This came a few days before a cabinet reshuffle in which minister Barbara Hogan (then Minister of Public Enterprises) was dismissed by Zuma. The Gupta family agreed that the meeting took place and agreed offering Vytijie a ministerial position. President Zuma claimed that he had no recollection of Vytjie Mentor.\n\nDeputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonas said he had been offered a ministerial position by the Guptas shortly before the dismissal of Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene in December 2015, but had rejected the offer as \"it makes a mockery of our hard-earned democracy‚ the trust of our people and no one apart from the President of the Republic appoints ministers\". The Gupta family denied offering Jonas the job of Finance Minister.\n\nIn May 2017, Jacob Zuma denied the allegation of blocking an attempt to set up a commission of inquiry to probe state capture.\n\nThe Guptas' alleged \"state capture\" was investigated by Public Protector Thuli Madonsela. President Zuma and Minister Des van Rooyen applied for a court order to prevent the publication of the report on 14 October 2016, Madonsela's last day in office. Van Rooyen's application was dismissed, and the President withdrew his application, leading to the release of the report on 2 November 2016. The report recommended establishment of a judicial commission of enquiry into the issues identified, including a full probe of Zuma's dealings with the Guptas, with findings to be published within 180 days.\n\nZuma and Van Rooyen denied any wrongdoing. The Guptas' lawyer disputed the evidence in the report, and the family welcomed the opportunity to challenge the report's findings in an official inquiry.\n\nOn 25 November 2016, Zuma announced that the Presidency would be reviewing the contents of the state capture report. He said it \"was done in a funny way\" with \"no fairness at all,\" and argued he was not given enough time to respond to the public protector.\n\nOn 11 September 2017 the former Finance Minister, Pravin Gordhan, estimated the cost of state capture at 250 billion Rand, in a presentation at the University of Cape Town Graduate School of Business.\n\nOn 13 November 2017, in an exclusive interview with ANN7 (belonging to the Gupta Family), South African President Jacob Zuma said 'State Capture' was a fancy word used by media houses for propaganda proliferation. He said that a real state capture would include seizure of the three arms of the constitution - Legislative, Executive and Judiciary - which has never been the case in South Africa.\n\nThe book How to Steal a City details state capture within the Nelson Mandela Bay Metropolitan Municipality in South Africa and takes place during the Zuma government.\n\nThe captured state of Hungary started after 2010. The former main opposition party won the 2/3rd of the mandates in the parliamentary election. The manipulation of the constitutional law and the Constitutional Court became possible. The parliamentary election laws was later tailored also to the purpose of the new governmental party. Step by step, the different institutional applications, competitions, and tenders have been won almost exclusively by organisations and individuals loyal to the government. The winners have been frequently the relatives of the governmental staff or connected with them. The managements of different institutions have been filled with persons loyal to the government. Independent applicants have been rejected without explanation or by created formal causes. The incomes of the government independent media had been dried up. These have been ceased with scarce exemptions. The subventions and advertisement expenditures of the state owned and government loyal companies have been directed to the purpose of the widely accessible propagandistic state media and to the government loyal press. The majority of the Hungarian population can only access government influenced radio stations. Only a single government independent television channel have been tolerated as a source of unfiltered news. The propaganda applies classical \"Machiavellian\" cunnings. It regularly use war termini, and show up two typical imaginary public enemies: \"migrants\" and \"George Soros\". Altogether these proceedings provided additional 2/3rd victories for the governmental party and more unrestricted possibilities for the administration.\n\n\n"}

This tale type is quite common in Norway and Iceland and very rare elsewhere.\n\nA version of the tale also appears in \"A Book of Witches\" and \"A Choice of Magic\", by Ruth Manning-Sanders.\n\nA king and queen had no children, which grieved the queen greatly. To alleviate the queen's loneliness, they adopted a girl to raise as their own. One day, when the queen saw her adopted daughter playing with a beggar girl, she scolded her adopted daughter and tried to drive the other girl off. However, the beggar girl mentioned that her mother knows a way for the queen to become pregnant.\n\nWhen the queen approached the beggar woman, the woman denies having such knowledge. The queen treated the woman to as much wine as the woman pleased until the woman is drunk. When the queen asked the drunk beggar woman how she could get a child of her own, the beggar woman told her to wash herself in two pails of water before going to bed, and afterward pour the water under the bed. The next morning, two flowers will have sprung up from under the bed: one fair and one rare. The beggar tells the queen that she must eat the beautiful one, but not to eat the hideous one no matter what. The queen followed this advice, and the next morning under the bed were two flowers. One was bright and lovely, and the other was black and foul. The queen ate the beautiful flower at once, but it tasted so sweet that she craved the other and ate it as well.\n\nNot long afterward, the queen bore a child. She gave birth to a girl who carried a wooden spoon in her hand and rode upon a goat. She was very ugly and loud from the moment she was born. The queen despairs having such a daughter until the girl tells her mother that her next child will be fair and agreeable. As the girl promised, the queen gave birth to a second daughter, one who was born fair and sweet, which pleased the queen very much. The sisters were as different as they could be, but they were very fond of each other. The elder daughter was named Tatterhood, because she wore a tattered hood over her unruly hair.\n\nOne Christmas Eve, when the girls were half grown, there was great noise in the gallery outside the queen's rooms. When Tatterhood demanded to know what was causing the noise, the queen reluctantly reveals that it was a pack of trolls (in some versions, witches) who come to the palace every seven years. Tatterhood, being headstrong, decides to drive the trolls off and instructs her mother keep the door tightly shut. Worried about Tatterhood, Tatterhood's younger sister opens one of the doors during the battle with the trolls. Her head is instantly snatched off by a troll and replaced with a calf's head, after which the trolls flee from the castle.\n\nTo restore her sister's head, Tatterhood sets off in a ship with no crew or company aside from her own sister. They arrive at the isle of the trolls and Tatterhood battles the trolls and successfully regain her sister's head. The sisters escape and arrive in a distant kingdom. The king, a widower with one son, fell in love with the younger sister at first sight. However, she declared she will not marry until Tatterhood does. The king begged his son to marry Tatterhood, and eventually he reluctantly agreed. \n\nThe two sisters were to be married to their grooms on the same day. The king, his young princess bride, and the king's son were regally adorned, while Tatterhood refused to dress up and happily wore her rags. As the couples rode to church to be married, Tatterhood asked her bridegroom why he did not ask why she rides a goat, and when he duly asked, she answered that she rode a grand horse, which it promptly becomes. She asked the prince why he does not ask why she carries a wooden spoon, which he asks, and she declares it to be a fan (or in some versions a wand), which it turns into. This is repeated with the tattered hood, which is turned into a golden crown, and with Tatterhood herself, whose beauty she declares to surpass her sister's, which it then does. The prince now understands that she chooses to appear ragged, and that her beauty matters not. He now is glad to be married to her.\n\n"}

It is the last painting by Manet of his favourite model, the fellow painter Victorine Meurent, who was also the model for his earlier works \"Olympia\" and the \"Luncheon on the Grass\". It was exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1874, and donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1956.\n\nMeurent is depicted sitting to the left side of the frame, in front of an iron fence near the Gare Saint-Lazare in Paris. The pensive subject is wearing a dark hat and sombre deep blue dress with white details, and is looking towards the viewer, while a sleeping puppy, a fan and an open book rest in her lap. Next to her is a little girl, modelled by the daughter of Manet's neighbour , a contrasting figure wearing a white dress with large blue bow, standing her back to the viewer, watching through the railings as a train passes beneath them. The black band in the girl's hair echoes the black band around the neck of the woman. Instead of choosing the traditional natural view as background for an outdoor scene, Manet opted for the iron grating which \"boldly stretches across the canvas\" (Gay 106). The only evidence of the train is its white cloud of steam. Modern apartment buildings can be seen in the background - including the house on the , near the , where Manet had rented a studio since July 1872 - and also a signal box and the Pont de l'Europe.\n\nThe arrangement compresses the foreground into a narrow focus, separated from the background by the row of railings. The traditional convention of deep space is ignored. Resting on a parapet to the right of the painting is a bunch of grapes, perhaps indicating that the painting was made in the autumn. The dog may be a reference to Titian's \"Venus of Urbino\"; Manet had earlier echoed Titian's composition in his \"Olympia\".\n\nHistorian Isabelle Dervaux has described the reception this painting received when it was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874: \"Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy. Caricaturists ridiculed Manet's picture, in which only a few recognized the symbol of modernity that it has become today\". \n\nShortly after it was completed, the painting was sold to baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure. It was sold in 1881 for 5,400 francs to the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who gave it several names: \"Enfant regardant le chemin de fer\", \"Le pont de l'Europe\", \"A la Gare St. Lazare\", and later just \"Gare St. Lazare\". It was sold on 31 December 1898 for 100,000 francs to American Henry Osborne Havemeyer. His wife Louisine Havemeyer left 2,000 artworks to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on her death in 1929, but she divided a small collection, including \"The Railway\", among her three children. The painting was donated to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1956 on the death of her son Horace Havemeyer.\n"}

The Mormon History Association also awarded him the 2002 Best Documentary Award for his and Charles Hatch's book \"A Widow's Tale, The 1884-1886 Diary of Helen Mar Kimball Whitney\", and the 1996 Award of Excellence for his article \"A Trajectory of Plurality: An Overview of Joseph Smith's Thirty Three Plural Wives\".\n\nCompton has contributed publications to the Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), including articles in \"FARMS Review of Books\" and \"Journal of Book of Mormon Studies\" and as an editor of the 1987 edition of Hugh Nibley's \"Mormonism and Early Christianity\". He has also been published in \"The Encyclopedia of Mormonism\", \"Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism\", \"American Journal of Philology\", \"\", \"Sunstone Magazine\", \"Classical Quarterly\", and the \"Journal of Popular Culture\".\n\nFrom 1993–1998, Compton served on the Editorial Board for the periodical \"\". Starting in 2004, Compton returned to work at \"Dialogue\", this time as the editorial staff's History Editor. Compton has also served on the Board of Editors for the \"Journal of Mormon History\" since 2000.\n\nCompton's biography of Jacob Hamblin, \"A Frontier Life: Jacob Hamblin, Explorer and Indian Missionary\", was published by the University of Utah Press in September, 2013. His article, \"'In & through the roughefist country it has ever been my lot to travel'\": Jacob Hamblin's 1858 Expedition Across the Colorado,\" (\"Utah Historical Quarterly\", Winter 2012) received the Dale L. Morgan Award from the Utah State Historical Society.\n\nIn May 2017, through his company Pahreah Press, Compton published a book on the songwriting of the Beatles, titled \"Who Wrote the Beatle Songs? A History of Lennon-McCartney\".\n\n"}

A parody of charity supergroup songs, it mocks the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake disaster and its victims. \"USA for Indonesia\" was aired on WQHT-FM (Hot 97), a New York City radio station, during the week of January 17, 2005. The show's producer, Rick Del Gado, wrote and produced the song, while shock jock Miss Jones introduced it. This was a response to jolt the ratings when former Hot 97 morning hosts Star & Buc Wild arrived at rival station WWPR-FM. The lyrics were deemed derogatory and offensive to many listeners, notably Asian Americans.\n\nMiss Info, a co-host of the now defunct radio show, made known her disagreement with the song being aired on the radio. Miss Jones accused her of feeling superior probably because she was Asian, and Todd Lynn, another co-host of then-radio show said afterward that he thought he was going to start shooting Asians. Within about a week many listeners, politicians and civil rights groups held a protest rally outside Hot 97. New York City Councilman John Liu and Charles Barron talked to media and press reporters about this fiasco and demanded that disciplinary action be taken against Hot 97. Councilwoman Letitia James noted \"If you're going to profit from hate, it's going to cost you and it's going to cost you dearly.\" The week following this protest rally, rap pioneer Afrika Bambaataa and other listeners held another protest rally, targeting Hot 97's misappropration of the hip hop culture and demanded a format change. Simultaneously, Sprint and McDonald's as well as \"New York Newsday\" pulled their advertising from the station, resulting in the station's financial losses.\n"}

(1987) were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem. Their results show that on average 80% of the times different people (experts in the same field) will name the same thing differently. There are usually tens of possible names that can be attributed to the same thing. This research motivated the work on latent semantic indexing.\n\nThe vocabulary mismatch between user created queries and relevant documents in a corpus causes the term mismatch problem in information retrieval. Zhao and Callan (2010) were perhaps the first to quantitatively study the vocabulary mismatch problem in a retrieval setting. Their results show that an average query term fails to appear in 30-40% of the documents that are relevant to the user query. They also showed that this probability of mismatch is a central probability in one of the fundamental probabilistic retrieval models, the Binary Independence Model. They developed novel term weight prediction methods that can lead to potentially 50-80% accuracy gains in retrieval over strong keyword retrieval models. Further research along the line shows that expert users can use Boolean Conjunctive Normal Form expansion to improve retrieval performance by 50-300% over unexpanded keyword queries.\n\n"}
{"id": "377029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=377029", "title": "Wild Bill Hickok", "text": "Wild Bill Hickok\n\nJames Butler Hickok (May 27, 1837 – August 2, 1876), better known as \"Wild Bill\" Hickok, was a folk hero of the American Old West known for his work across the frontier as a drover, wagon master, soldier, spy, scout, lawman, gunfighter, gambler, showman, and actor. He earned a great deal of notoriety in his own time, much of it bolstered by the many outlandish and often fabricated tales that he told about his life. Some contemporaneous reports of his exploits are known to be fictitious, but they remain the basis of much of his fame and reputation, along with his own stories.\n\nHickok was born and raised on a farm in northern Illinois at a time when lawlessness and vigilante activity were rampant because of the influence of the \"Banditti of the Prairie\". Hickok was drawn to this ruffian lifestyle and headed west at age 18 as a fugitive from justice, working as a stagecoach driver and later as a lawman in the frontier territories of Kansas and Nebraska. He fought and spied for the Union Army during the American Civil War and gained publicity after the war as a scout, marksman, actor, and professional gambler. Over the course of his life, he was involved in several notable shoot-outs.\n\nIn 1876, Hickok was shot from behind and killed while playing poker in a saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory (present-day South Dakota) by Jack McCall, an unsuccessful gambler. The hand of cards which he supposedly held at the time of his death has become known as the dead man's hand: two pairs, aces and eights.\n\nHickok remains a popular figure in frontier history. Many historic sites and monuments commemorate his life, and he has been depicted numerous times in literature, film, and television. He is chiefly portrayed as a protagonist, though historical accounts of his actions are often controversial and most of his career was exaggerated by both himself and various mythmakers. While Hickok claimed to have killed numerous named and unnamed gunmen in his lifetime, according to Joseph G. Rosa, Hickok's biographer and the foremost authority on Wild Bill, Hickok killed only six or seven men in gunfights.\n\nJames Butler Hickok was born May 27, 1837, in Homer, Illinois, (present-day Troy Grove, Illinois) to William Alonzo Hickok, a farmer and abolitionist, and his wife Polly Butler. His father was said to have used the family house, now demolished, as a station on the Underground Railroad.\n\nHickok was the fourth of six children. William Hickok died in 1852, when James was 15.\n\nHickok was a good shot from a young age and was recognized locally as an outstanding marksman with a pistol.\n\nPhotographs of Hickok appear to depict dark hair, but all contemporaneous descriptions affirm that it was red. (Reddish shades of hair appear black in early photographic processes because of their sensitivity, primarily to blue light.)\n\nIn 1855, at age 18, James Hickok fled Illinois following a fight with Charles Hudson, during which both fell into a canal (each thought, mistakenly, that he had killed the other). Hickok moved to Leavenworth in the Kansas Territory, where he joined \"General\" Jim Lane's Free State Army (also known as the Jayhawkers), a vigilante group active in the new territory. While a Jayhawker, he met 12-year-old William Cody (later known as Buffalo Bill), who despite his youth served as a scout just two years later for the U.S. Army during the Utah War.\n\nWhile in Nebraska, James Hickok was derisively referred to as \"Duck Bill\" for his long nose and protruding lips. He grew a moustache following the McCanles incident and in 1861 began calling himself Wild Bill. He was also known before 1861 by Jayhawkers as \"Shanghai Bill\" because of his height and slim build.\n\nHickok used his late brother's name, William Hickok, from 1858 and the name William Haycock during the Civil War. Most newspapers referred to him as William Haycock until 1869. He was arrested while using the name Haycock in 1865. He afterward resumed using his given name, James Hickok. Military records after 1865 list him as Hickok but note that he was also known as Haycock. In an 1867 article about his shoot-out with Davis Tutt, his surname was misspelled as Hitchcock.\n\nIn 1857, Hickok claimed a 160-acre (65-ha) tract in Johnson County, Kansas (near present-day Lenexa). On March 22, 1858, he was elected one of the first four constables of Monticello Township. In 1859, he joined the Russell, Majors and Waddell freight company, the parent company of the Pony Express.\n\nIn 1860, he was badly injured by a bear while driving a freight team from Independence, Missouri to Santa Fe, New Mexico. According to Hickok's account, he found the road blocked by a cinnamon bear and its two cubs. Dismounting, he approached the bear and fired a shot into its head, but the bullet ricocheted off its skull, infuriating it. The bear attacked, crushing Hickok with its body. Hickok managed to fire another shot, wounding the bear's paw. The bear then grabbed his arm in its mouth, but Hickok was able to grab his knife and slash its throat, killing it.\n\nHickok was severely injured, with a crushed chest, shoulder and arm. He was bedridden for four months before being sent to Rock Creek Station in the Nebraska Territory to work as a stable hand while he recovered. The freight company had built the stagecoach stop along the Oregon Trail near Fairbury, Nebraska, on land purchased from David McCanles.\n\nOn July 12, 1861, David McCanles went to the Rock Creek Station office to demand an overdue property payment from Horace Wellman, the station manager. McCanles reportedly threatened Wellman, and either Hickok (who was hiding behind a curtain) or Wellman killed him. Hickok, Wellman, and another employee, J.W. Brink, were tried for killing McCanles but were found to have acted in self-defense. McCanles may have been the first man Hickok killed. Hickok subsequently visited McCanles' widow, apologized for the killing, and offered her $35 in restitution, all the money he had with him at the time.\n\nAfter the Civil War broke out in April 1861, James Hickok became a teamster for the Union Army in Sedalia, Missouri. By the end of 1861, he was a wagon master, but in September 1862 he was discharged for unknown reasons. He then joined General James Henry Lane's Kansas Brigade and, while serving with the brigade, saw his friend Buffalo Bill Cody, who was serving as a scout.\n\nIn late 1863 he worked for the provost marshal of southwest Missouri as a member of the Springfield detective police. His work included identifying and counting the number of troops in uniform who were drinking while on duty, verifying hotel liquor licenses, and tracking down individuals who owed money to the cash-strapped Union Army.\n\nBuffalo Bill claimed that he encountered Hickok disguised as a Confederate officer in Missouri in 1864. Hickok had not been paid for some time and was hired as a scout by General John B. Sanborn by early 1865. In June, Hickok mustered out and went to Springfield, where he gambled. The 1883 \"History of Greene County, Missouri\" described him as \"by nature a ruffian ... a drunken, swaggering fellow, who delighted when 'on a spree' to frighten nervous men and timid women.\"\n\nWhile in Springfield, Hickok and a local gambler named Davis Tutt had several disagreements over unpaid gambling debts and their mutual affection for the same women. Hickok lost a gold watch to Tutt in a poker game. The watch had great sentimental value to Hickok and he asked Tutt not to wear it in public.\nThey initially agreed not to fight over the watch, but when Hickok saw Tutt wearing it, he warned him to stay away. On July 21, 1865, the two men faced off in Springfield's town square, standing sideways before drawing and firing their weapons. Their quick-draw duel was recorded as the first of its kind. Tutt's shot missed, but Hickok's struck Tutt through the heart from about away. Tutt called out, \"Boys, I'm killed\" before he collapsed and died.\n\nTwo days later, Hickok was arrested for murder. The charge was later reduced to manslaughter. He was released on $2,000 bail and stood trial on August 3, 1865. At the end of the trial, Judge Sempronius H. Boyd told the jury they could not find Hickok acted in self-defense if he could have reasonably avoided the fight. However, if they felt the threat of danger was real and imminent, he instructed they could apply the unwritten law of the \"fair fight\" and acquit. The jury voted to clear Hickok, resulting in public backlash and criticism of the verdict.\n\nSeveral weeks later, an interview Hickok gave to Colonel George Ward Nichols, a journalist known as the creator of the Hickok legend, was published in \"Harper's New Monthly Magazine\". Under the name \"Wild Bill Hitchcock\", the article recounted the \"hundreds\" of men whom Hickok had personally killed and other exaggerated exploits. The article was controversial wherever Hickok was known, and several frontier newspapers wrote rebuttals.\n\nIn September 1865, Hickok came in second in the election for city marshal of Springfield. Leaving Springfield, he was recommended for the position of deputy federal marshal at Fort Riley, Kansas. This was during the Indian Wars, in which Hickok sometimes served as a scout for General George A. Custer's 7th Cavalry.\n\nIn 1865, Hickok recruited six Indians to accompany him to Niagara Falls, where he put on an outdoor demonstration called \"The Daring Buffalo Chasers of the Plains\". Since the event was outdoors, he could not compel people to pay, and the venture was a financial failure.\n\nHickok was reported by some to be \"an inveterate hater of Indians\", perhaps to enhance his reputation as a scout and Indian fighter, but it is difficult to separate fact from fiction considering his recruitment of Native Americans to cross the nation in order to appear in his own Wild West show. Witnesses confirm that while working as a scout at Fort Harker, Kansas, on May 11, 1867, he was attacked by a large group of Indians, who fled after he shot and killed two. In July, Hickok told a newspaper reporter that he had led several soldiers in pursuit of Indians who had killed four men near the fort on July 2. He reported returning with five prisoners after killing ten. Witnesses confirm that the story was true to the extent the party had set out to find whoever had killed the four men, but the group returned to the fort \"without nary a dead Indian, [never] even seeing a live one\".\n\nIn 1867, Hickok reportedly was involved in a dispute with drunken cowboys inside a saloon in Jefferson County, Nebraska. One of them pushed him, causing him to drop his drink. Hickok struck the man, and four of his friends rose with guns drawn. Hickok persuaded the men to step outside where he faced all four at 15 paces, or about . The bartender counted down and Hickok killed three of the men with a bullet to the head and wounded the fourth with a shot through the cheek bone. Hickok was wounded in the shoulder.\n\nLater that year, he moved to Kansas, where he ran for sheriff in Ellsworth County on November 5, 1867. He was defeated by a former soldier, E.W. Kingsbury.\n\nIn December 1867, newspapers reported that Hickok had come to stay in Hays City, Kansas. He became a Deputy U.S. marshal, and on March 28, 1868, he picked up eleven Union Army deserters who had been charged with stealing government property. Hickok was assigned to bring the men to Topeka for trial, and he requested a military escort from Fort Hays. He was assigned William F. Cody, a sergeant, and five privates. They arrived in Topeka on April 2. Hickok remained in Hays through August 1868, when he brought 200 Cheyenne Indians to Hays to be viewed by \"excursionists\".\n\nOn September 1, Hickok was in Lincoln County, Kansas, where he was hired as a scout by the 10th Cavalry Regiment, a segregated African-American unit. On September 4, Hickok was wounded in the foot while rescuing several cattlemen in the Bijou Creek Basin who had been surrounded by Indians. The 10th Regiment arrived at Fort Lyon in Colorado in October and remained there for the rest of 1868.\n\nIn July 1869, Hickok returned to Hays and was elected city marshal of Hays and sheriff of Ellis County, Kansas, in a special election held on August 23, 1869. Three sheriffs had quit during the previous 18 months. Hickok may have been acting sheriff before he was elected; a newspaper reported that he arrested offenders on August 18, and the commander of Fort Hays wrote a letter to the assistant adjutant general on August 21 in which he praised Hickok for his work in apprehending deserters.\n\nThe regular county election was held on November 2, 1869, and Hickok, running as an independent, lost to his deputy, Peter Lanihan, running as a Democrat, but Hickok and Lanihan remained sheriff and deputy, respectively. Hickok accused a J.V. Macintosh of irregularities and misconduct during the election. On December 9, Hickok and Lanihan both served legal papers on Macintosh, and local newspapers acknowledged that Hickok had guardianship of Hays City.\n\nIn September 1869, his first month as sheriff, Hickok killed two men. The first was Bill Mulvey, who was rampaging through town, drunk, shooting out mirrors and whisky bottles behind bars. Citizens warned Mulvey to behave, because Hickok was sheriff. Mulvey angrily declared that he had come to town to kill Hickok. When he saw Hickok, he leveled his cocked rifle at him. Hickok waved his hand past Mulvey at some onlookers and yelled, \"Don't shoot him in the back; he is drunk.\" Mulvey wheeled his horse around to face those who might shoot him from behind, and before he realized he had been fooled, Hickok shot him through the temple.\n\nThe second killed by Hickok was Samuel Strawhun, a cowboy, who was causing a disturbance at 1 a.m. in a saloon on September 27 when Hickok and Lanihan went to the scene. Strawhun \"made remarks against Hickok,\" and Hickok killed him with a shot through the head. Hickok said he had \"tried to restore order\". At the coroner's inquest into Strawhun's death, despite \"very contradictory\" evidence from witnesses, the jury found the shooting justifiable.\n\nOn July 17, 1870, Hickok was attacked by two troopers from the 7th U.S. Cavalry, Jeremiah Lonergan and John Kyle (sometimes spelled Kile), in a saloon. Lonergan pinned Hickok to the ground, and Kyle put his gun to Hickok's ear. When Kyle's weapon misfired, Hickok shot Lonergan, wounding him in the knee, and shot Kyle twice, killing him. Hickok was not re-elected to office.\n\nOn April 15, 1871, Hickok became marshal of Abilene, Kansas. He replaced Tom \"Bear River\" Smith, who had been killed on November 2, 1870.\nThe outlaw John Wesley Hardin arrived in Abilene at the end of a cattle drive in early 1871. Hardin was a well-known gunfighter and is known to have killed more than 27 men. In his 1895 autobiography, published after his death, Hardin claimed to have been befriended by Hickok, the newly elected town marshal, after he had disarmed the marshal using the road agent's spin. However, Hardin was known to exaggerate. In any case, Hardin appeared to have thought highly of Hickok.\n\nHickok later said he did not know that \"Wesley Clemmons\" was Hardin's alias and that he was a wanted outlaw. He told Clemmons (Hardin) to stay out of trouble in Abilene and asked him to hand over his guns, and Hardin complied. Hardin claimed that when his cousin, Mannen Clements, was jailed for killing two cowhands, he persuaded Hickok to arrange for his escape.\n\nIn August 1871, \"Wild Bill\" Hickok sought to arrest Hardin for killing Charles Couger in an Abilene hotel \"for snoring too loud\". Hardin left Kansas before Hickok could arrest him.\n\nHickok and Phil Coe, a saloon owner and acquaintance of Hardin's, had a dispute that resulted in a shootout. The Bull's Head Saloon in Abilene had been established by the gambler Ben Thompson and Coe, his partner, businessman and fellow gambler. The two entrepreneurs had painted a picture of a bull with a large erect penis on the side of their establishment as an advertisement. Citizens of the town complained to Hickok, who requested that Thompson and Coe remove the bull. They refused, so Hickok altered it himself. Infuriated, Thompson tried to incite John Wesley Hardin to kill Hickok, by exclaiming to Hardin that \"He's a damn Yankee. Picks on rebels, especially Texans, to kill.\" Hardin was in town under his assumed name Wesley Clemmons but was better known to the townspeople by the alias Little Arkansas. He seemed to have respect for Hickok's abilities and replied, \"If Bill needs killing why don't you kill him yourself?\" Hoping to intimidate Hickok, Coe allegedly stated that he could \"kill a crow on the wing\". Hickok's retort is one of the West's most famous sayings (though possibly apocryphal): \"Did the crow have a pistol? Was he shooting back? I will be.\"\n\nOn October 5, 1871, Hickok was standing off a crowd during a street brawl when Coe fired two shots. Hickok ordered him to be arrested for firing a pistol within the city limits. Coe claimed that he was shooting at a stray dog, and then suddenly turned his gun on Hickok, who fired first and killed Coe. Hickok caught a glimpse of someone running toward him and quickly fired two more shots in reaction, accidentally shooting and killing Abilene Special Deputy Marshal Mike Williams, who was coming to his aid. This event haunted Hickok for the remainder of his life. There is another account of the Coe shootout: Theophilus Little, the mayor of Abilene and owner of the town's lumber yard, recorded his time in Abilene by writing in a notebook which was ultimately given to the Abilene Historical Society. Writing in 1911, he detailed his admiration of Hickok and included a paragraph on the shooting that differs considerably from the reported account:\n\nHickok was relieved of his duties as marshal less than two months after accidentally killing Deputy Williams, this incident being only one of a series of questionable shootings and claims of misconduct.\n\nIn 1873, Buffalo Bill Cody and Texas Jack Omohundro invited Hickok to join their troupe after their earlier success. Hickok did not enjoy acting, and often hid behind scenery. In one show he shot the spotlight when it focused on him. He was released from the group after a few months.\n\nIn 1876, Hickok was diagnosed by a doctor in Kansas City, Missouri, with glaucoma and ophthalmia. Alhough he was just 39, his marksmanship and health were apparently in decline, and he had been arrested several times for vagrancy, despite earning a good income from gambling and displays of showmanship only a few years earlier.\n\nMartha Jane Cannary, known popularly as Calamity Jane, claimed in her autobiography that she was married to Hickok and had divorced him so he could be free to marry Agnes Lake, but no records have been found that support her account. The two possibly met for the first time after Jane was released from the guardhouse in Fort Laramie and joined the wagon train in which Hickok was traveling. The wagon train arrived in Deadwood in July 1876. Jane confirmed this account in an 1896 newspaper interview, although she claimed she had been hospitalized with illness rather than in the guardhouse.\n\nOn March 5, 1876, Hickok married Agnes Thatcher Lake, a 50-year-old circus proprietor in Cheyenne, Wyoming Territory. Hickok left his new bride a few months later, joining Charlie Utter's wagon train to seek his fortune in the goldfields of South Dakota. \nShortly before Hickok's death, he wrote a letter to his new wife, which read in part, \"Agnes Darling, if such should be we never meet again, while firing my last shot, I will gently breathe the name of my wife—Agnes—and with wishes even for my enemies I will make the plunge and try to swim to the other shore.\"\n\nOn August 1, 1876, Hickok was playing poker at Nuttal & Mann's Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. When a seat opened up at the table, a drunk man named Jack McCall sat down to play. McCall lost heavily. Hickok encouraged McCall to quit the game until he could cover his losses and offered to give him money for breakfast. Although McCall accepted the money, he was apparently insulted.\n\nThe next day, Hickok was playing poker again. He usually sat with his back to a wall so he could see the entrance, but the only seat available when he joined the game was a chair facing away from the door. He twice asked another man at the table, Charles Rich, to change seats with him, but Rich refused.\n\nMcCall entered the saloon, walked up behind Hickok, drew his Colt's Model 1873 Single Action Army .45 caliber revolver, and shouted, \"Damn you! Take that!\" He shot Hickok in the back of the head at point-blank range. Hickok died instantly. The bullet emerged through Hickok's right cheek and struck another player, riverboat Captain William Massie, in the left wrist. Hickok may have told his friend Charlie Utter and others who were traveling with them that he thought he would be killed while in Deadwood.\n\nMcCall's motive for killing Hickok is the subject of speculation, largely concerning McCall's anger at Hickok's having given him money for breakfast the day before, after McCall had lost heavily.\n\nMcCall was summoned before an informal \"miners' jury\" (an ad hoc local group of miners and businessmen). McCall claimed he was avenging Hickok's earlier slaying of his brother, which may have been true. (A man named Lew McCall was killed by an unknown lawman in Abilene, Kansas, but it is not known if the two McCall men were related.) McCall was acquitted of the murder, which prompted editorializing in the \"Black Hills Pioneer\": \"Should it ever be our misfortune to kill a man ... we would simply ask that our trial may take place in some of the mining camps of these hills.\" Calamity Jane was reputed to have led a mob that threatened McCall with lynching, but at the time of Hickok's death, Jane was being held by military authorities.\n\nAfter bragging about killing Hickok, McCall was re-arrested. The second trial was not considered double jeopardy because of the irregular jury in the first trial and because Deadwood was in Indian country. The new trial was held in Yankton, the capital of the Dakota Territory. Hickok's brother, Lorenzo Butler, traveled from Illinois to attend the retrial. McCall was found guilty and sentenced to death.\n\nLeander Richardson, a reporter, interviewed McCall shortly before his execution and wrote an article about him for the April 1877 issue of \"Scribner's Monthly\". Butler spoke with McCall after the trial and said McCall showed no remorse.\n\nJack McCall was hanged on March 1, 1877 and buried in a Roman Catholic cemetery. The cemetery was moved in 1881, and when McCall's body was exhumed, the noose was found still around his neck.\n\nHickok was playing five-card stud when he was shot. He was holding two pairs: black aces and black eights as his \"up cards\". The identity of the fifth card (his \"hole card\") is the subject of debate.\n\nCharlie Utter, Hickok's friend and companion, claimed Hickok's body and placed a notice in the local newspaper, the \"Black Hills Pioneer\", which read:\n\nAlmost the entire town attended the funeral, and Utter had Hickok buried with a wooden grave marker reading:\n\nHickok is known to have fatally shot six men and is suspected of having killed a seventh (McCanles). Despite his reputation, Hickok was buried in the Ingelside Cemetery, Deadwood's original graveyard. This cemetery filled quickly, and in 1879, on the third anniversary of his original burial, Utter paid to move Hickok's remains to the new Mount Moriah Cemetery. Utter supervised the move and noted that, while perfectly preserved, Hickok had been imperfectly embalmed. As a result, calcium carbonate from the surrounding soil had replaced the flesh, leading to petrifaction. One of the workers, Joseph McLintock, wrote a detailed description of the re-interment. McLintock used a cane to tap the body, face, and head, finding no soft tissue anywhere. He noted that the sound was similar to tapping a brick wall, and believed the remains to weigh more than . William Austin, the cemetery caretaker, estimated , which made it difficult for the men to carry the remains to the new site. The original wooden grave marker was moved to the new site, but by 1891 it had been destroyed by souvenir hunters whittling pieces from it, and it was replaced with a statue. This, in turn, was destroyed by souvenir hunters and replaced in 1902 by a life-sized sandstone sculpture of Hickok. This, too, was badly defaced, and was then enclosed in a cage for protection. The enclosure was cut open by souvenir hunters in the 1950s, and the statue was removed.\nHickok is currently interred in a ten-foot (3 m) square plot at the Mount Moriah Cemetery, surrounded by a cast-iron fence, with a U.S. flag flying nearby. A monument has been built there.\n\nIt has been reported that Calamity Jane was buried next to him, according to her dying wish. Four of the men on the self-appointed committee who planned Calamity's funeral (Albert Malter, Frank Ankeney, Jim Carson, and Anson Higby) later stated that, since Hickok had \"absolutely no use\" for Jane in this life, they decided to play a posthumous joke on him by laying her to rest by his side. Potato Creek Johnny, a local Deadwood celebrity from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, is also buried next to Wild Bill.\n\nHickok's favorite guns were a pair of Colt 1851 Navy Model (.36 caliber) cap-and-ball revolvers. They had ivory grips and nickel plating and were ornately engraved with \"J.B. Hickok–1869\" on the backstrap. He wore his revolvers butt-forward in a belt or sash (when wearing city clothes or buckskins, respectively), and seldom used holsters per se; he drew the pistols using a \"reverse\", \"twist\" or cavalry draw, as would a cavalryman.\n\nAt the time of his death Hickok was wearing a Smith & Wesson Model 2 Army Revolver, a newly released five-shot, single-action 38 cal. weapon. Bonhams auction company offered this pistol at auction on November 18, 2013, in San Francisco, California, described as Hickok's Smith & Wesson No. 2, serial number 29963, a .32 rimfire with a six-inch barrel, blued finish and varnished rosewood grips. The gun did not sell because the highest bid of $220,000 was less than the reserve set by the gun's owners.\n\nHickok has remained one of the most popular and iconic figures of the American Old West and is still frequently depicted in popular culture, including literature, film, and television.\n\nParamount Pictures' Western silent film \"Wild Bill Hickok\" (released on November 18, 1923) was directed by Clifford Smith and stars William S. Hart as Hickok. A print of the film is maintained in the Museum of Modern Art film archive.\n\nThe movie \"The Plainsman\" (1936), starring Gary Cooper as Wild Bill Hickok, features the relationship between Buffalo Bill and Calamity Jane as its main plot line. It is a loose adaptation of J. B. Hickok's life ending with his infamous aces and eights card hand.\n\nA highly fictional film account of Hickok's later years and death, titled \"Wild Bill\" (released on December 18, 1995), stars Jeff Bridges as James Butler \"Wild Bill\" Hickok and David Arquette as Jack McCall, and was written and directed by Walter Hill. The film received mixed reviews, and currently holds a 5.9 rating on the Internet Movie Database and a 41% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nA semi-fictionalized version of Hickok's time as Marshal of Abilene Kansas, titled \"Hickok\" (released on July 7, 2017), stars Luke Hemsworth as James Butler \"Wild Bill\" Hickok, Trace Adkins as the Bulls Head saloonkeeper Phil Coe, Kris Kristofferson as Abilene mayor George Knox, and Kaiwi Lyman-Mersereau as John Wesley Hardin. It was written by Michael Lanahan and directed by Timothy Woodward Jr.\n\nA Screen Gems television series, \"The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok\", with Guy Madison in the starring role and Andy Devine as sidekick Pete \"Jingles\" Jones, ran for eight seasons from 1951 through 1958, first in syndication and then on CBS for the last three seasons. \n\nThe actor Rhodes Reason played Hickok on the 1966 episode, \"A Calamity Called Jane\", on the syndicated anthology series, \"Death Valley Days\", hosted by Robert Taylor. In the story line, Calamity and Hickok argue over her masculine wardrobe and manners. The segment concludes with Hickok's assassination by Jack McCall in a saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. \n\nIn episodes 1-4 of the HBO dramatic television series \"Deadwood\", which aired from 2004 to 2006, Hickok, portrayed by Keith Carradine, is shown arriving in Deadwood with Charlie Utter and Calamity Jane, with the Deadwood camp inhabitants aware of Hickok's celebrity status as a gunfighter and lawman. The series shows Hickok as a self-destructive, compulsive gambler who is eventually murdered while playing poker and subsequently laid to rest in Deadwood's cemetery.\n\nIn the early 1990's, the ABC television series, the \"Young Riders\", a fictional account of Pony Express riders, Hickok is portrayed by Josh Brolin.\nHickok's birthplace is now the Wild Bill Hickok Memorial and is a listed historic site under the supervision of the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. The town of Deadwood, South Dakota re-enacts Hickok's murder and McCall's capture every summer evening.\n\nIn 1979, Hickok was inducted into the Poker Hall of Fame.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4157871", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4157871", "title": "Word superiority effect", "text": "Word superiority effect\n\nIn cognitive psychology, the word superiority effect (WSE) refers to the phenomenon that people have better recognition of letters presented within words as compared to isolated letters and to letters presented within nonword (orthographically illegal, unpronounceable letter array) strings. Studies have also found a WSE when letter identification within words is compared to letter identification within pseudowords (e.g. \"WOSK\") and pseudohomophones (e.g. \"WERK\").\n\nThe effect was first described by Cattell (1886), and important contributions came from Reicher (1969) and Wheeler (1970). Cattell first wrote, \"I find it takes about twice as long to read...words which have no connexion as words which make sentences, and letters which have no connexions as letters which make words. When the words make sentences and the letters words, not only do the processes of seeing and naming overlap, but by one mental effort the subject can recognize a whole group of words or letters\".\n\nG. Reicher and D. Wheeler developed the basic experimental paradigm to study the WSE, referred to as the Reicher-Wheeler paradigm. In this paradigm, an observer is presented with a word or nonword string that is followed by a mask (brief stimulus to measure effects on behavior) . The observer is then asked to name one of the letters from the cued position in that word or string making the test a two-alternative forced choice (2-AFC). For example, for the letter R in the word \"card\", an observer might be asked to choose between the letter R and T, and will usually be more efficient in doing so than if they are asked to make the same choice with the string of letters such as \"cqrd\". Each possible completion with the two possible letters in the word condition produce a word.\n\nThe WSE has since been exhaustively studied in the context of cognitive processes involved during reading. Large amounts of research have also been done to try to model the effect using connectionist networks.\n\nThe WSE has traditionally been tested using a tachistoscope, as the durations of the letter string presentations need to be carefully controlled. Recently, stimulus presentation software has allowed much simpler manipulation of presentation durations using computers. The WSE has also been described without a tachistoscope.\n\nA string of letters, usually four or five, is flashed for several milliseconds onto a screen. Readers are then asked to choose which of two letters had been in the flashed string. For example, if \"WOSK\" had been flashed, a reader might have to decide whether \"K\" or \"H\" had been in \"WOSK\". A WSE arises when subjects choose the correct letter more consistently when letter strings are real words rather than nonwords (e.g. \"WKRG\") or single letters.\n\nThe existence of a WSE generally implies that there is some type of access or encoding advantage that words have in the mind that pseudowords or single letters do not have. Various studies have proposed that the distinction is a result of pronounceability differences (nonwords are not pronounceable and therefore are not as easily remembered), frequency (real words are more frequently encountered and used), meaningfulness (real words have semantic value and therefore are better retained in memory), orthographic regularity (real words follow familiar spelling conventions and are therefore better retained in memory), or neighborhood density (real words tend to share more letters with other words than nonwords and therefore have more activation in the mind).\n\nOther studies have proposed that the WSE is heavily affected or even induced by experimental factors, such as the type of masking used after the presentation of the word, or the duration of the masks.\n\nThe two popular models claiming to explain the WSE are the interactive activation model (IAM) and the dual-route coding model (DRC) Neither of these models takes attention into account; This is a relationship looked into through research on the WSE. Evidence shows that the WSE persists without an observer’s conscious awareness of the word presented, which implies that attention is neither necessary for WSE nor involved in this phenomenon. However, attentional focus has been demonstrated to modulate the WSE which agrees with recent neurophysiological data explaining that attention, in fact, modulates early stages of word processing.\n\nThe activation-verification model (AVM) is another model that was developed to account for reaction time data from lexical decision and naming tasks. The basic operations explored in the AVM that are involved in word and letter recognition are encoding, verification, and decision. Both the IAM and the AVM share many basic assumptions such as the fact that stimulus input activates spatially-specific letter units, that activated letter units, modulate the activity of word units, and that letter and word recognition are frequently affected by top-down processes (e.g. Reading the phrase \"A cow says...\" a person would guess \"moo\" and in checking that the word begins with 'm' ignores the rest of the letters).\n\nThe WSE has proven to be an important finding for word recognition models, and specifically is supported by Rumelhart and McClelland's interactive-activation model of word recognition. According to this model, when a reader is presented with a word, each letter in parallel will either stimulate or inhibit different feature detectors (e.g. a curved shape for \"C\", horizontal and vertical bars for \"H\", etc.). Those feature detectors will then stimulate or inhibit different letter detectors, which will finally stimulate or inhibit different word detectors. Each activated connection would carry a different weight, and thus the word \"WORK\" in the example would be activated more than any other word (and therefore recognized by a reader).\n\nAccording to this interactive-activation model, the WSE is explained as such: When the target letter is presented within a word, the feature detectors, letter detectors and word detectors will all be activated, adding weight to the final recognition of the stimulus. However, when only the letter is presented, only the letter detector level will be activated. Therefore, we may remember the presented stimulus word more clearly, and thereby be more accurate in identifying its component letters, as observed in the WSE.\n\nThe AVM deals with encoding, verification, and decision operations. Encoding is used to describe the early operations that lead to the unconscious activation of learned units in memory. After encoding, verification occurs. Verification often leads to the conscious recognition of a single lexical entry from the respondents. Verification is to be viewed as an independent, top-down analysis of stimulus that is guided by the stored, or previously learned, representation of a word. Real-time processing in verification can be mimicked by a computer simulation. Lastly, the factors affecting speed and accuracy of performance in a particular paradigm depend on whether decisions are based primarily on information from encoding or verification.\n\nOne of the findings of the Johnston and McClelland reportwas that the WSE does not occur inevitably whenever we compare a word and a nonword. Rather, it depends somewhat upon the strategies that readers use during a task. If readers paid more attention to the letter in a particular \"position\", they would experience the adverse word superiority effect. This is because the reader would no longer have the benefit of having the word detector level activated with as much weight if they neglected to focus on the full word.\n\n\n\n"}

Although the group supports all women in domestic services, its primary focus is on women from South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal).\n\nWorkers' Awaaz was founded in June 1997 by a group of South Asian women activists and domestic workers. Workers' Awaaz assists workers in ensuring that they are paid the minimum wage, receive overtime pay, are aware of their rights under workers' compensation laws, and receive training in basic employee rights and protection under state and federal law. The organization also sues employers on behalf of domestic workers for violations of federal and state laws, and organizes pickets and demonstrations against abusive employers.\n\nWorkers' Awaaz also works to build public awareness of the sometimes abusive conditions under which many South Asian domestic workers labor in the U.S.\n\nSince many immigrant domestics are isolated by language, working conditions and restrictions placed on them by employers, Workers' Awaaz uses a variety of outreach efforts to reach workers in need. It places advertisements in various South Asian-related newspapers, sets up tables at South Asian community events, and engages in face-to-face conversations in markets and stores.\n\nWorkers' Awaaz has won several lawsuits filed on behalf of workers against employers who did not pay minimum wage, withhold taxes or make Social Security and other required government payments.\n\nIn 1998, Workers' Awaaz, working with the American Civil Liberties Union, won a $20,000 back pay settlement. In January 2000, the organization won a back pay award for $50,000 from physicians who refused to pay a domestic worker for nearly three years.\n\nIn 1997, Workers' Awaaz won a $5,000 grassroots grant from the Ben & Jerry's Foundation.\n\nIn 1998, Ahmed was honored as a fellow of the Petra Foundation for her advocacy work with Workers' Awaaz. In 2000, the organization was awarded a Union Square Award from the Tides Center for its grassroots activism and strengthening of immigrant communities in New York City.\n\nIn 2000, Shahbano Aliani, M. Bala, Shahensha Begum, Rekha Devi, Rokeya Mollah and Rokeya Begum—lead organizers and board members—received the Union Square Award from the Fund for the City of New York. \n\n\n"}

It was founded by the Mixtec civilization in the pre-Classic Period as a small village dedicated to agriculture and obsidian.\n\nBecause of its antiquity and its long-term continuous occupation (from the fourteenth century BCE to the ninth century CE), Yucuita is one of the most studied Mixtec archaeological sites.\n\nLocated in a small plain of Oaxaca's Sierra Mixteca, Yucuita is some northeast of the city of Oaxaca, the capital of the state.\n\nAlthough the precolumbian Mixtecs were not characterized by monumental architecture, in Yucuita there are two architectonic complexes that have been the object of numerous investigations since the 1930s, when Esteban Avendaño explored the zone (1933). The most recent excavations at the site were in 1976-80 by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH).\n\nOne of these complexes was dedicated to the living quarters of the governing elite. It consists of a platform constructed on the slope of a hill. The platform supports the remains of living quarters set around a central patio. The second complex was a ceremonial center, of which only part of the platform and two long walls remain. One wall is 70 m long by 4 m high (230 ft by 13 ft). At right angles to it is another wall, long. On the northern side of the first wall is a narrow stairway leading to the top of the platform. Near the stairway is a narrow tunnel roughly in length, which served for drainage and as a passageway.\n\n\nThis article is a free translation of the article at the Spanish Wikipedia.\n\n"}
