The Fair's theme that year was a Century of Progress, and celebrated man's innovations in architecture, science, technology and transportation. The \"Homes of Tomorrow\" exhibition was one of the most noteworthy exhibits of the Fair, and showcased man's modern innovations in architecture, design, and building materials. \n\nIn addition to several unique art deco and contemporary designs for a dozen model homes, futuristic home furnishings and accoutrements such as a personal helicopter pad were anticipated. Several architects and firms used the model homes to demonstrate their techniques for the pre-fabricated home and new materials. Baked enamel and Rostone — a man-made type of masonry that could be molded into specific shapes and produced in various colors — were hailed as affordable and durable home construction options. \n\nThe following homes were showcased in the exhibit which ran the duration of the fair: \n\nAfter the exposition ended in 1934, Robert Bartlett purchased five of the homes, the Wieboldt-Rostone House, the House of Tomorrow, the Florida Tropical House, the Cypress Log Cabin, and the Armco-Ferro House, loaded them on barges and floated them across Lake Michigan to Beverly Shores, Indiana. The original homes have survived the last 75 years on the shores of Lake Michigan and are being restored through a partnership between the National Park Service, Indiana, the Indiana Landmarks, and private individuals. As visitors passed through the homes during the fair, many bought plans and erected the designs in other states.\n\n\n\n"}

Andrea inherited the family workshop from his famous uncle, Luca della Robbia, who had developed the technique of applying tin glazes, similar to those used by potters, to terracotta (fired clay) to produce sculptures that were colourful, durable and relatively cheap. Larger sculptures, such as this example which dates to about 1500–1510, were made in sections in order to fit into the kiln for firing.\n\nThe scene is set in a landscape, showing the Three Kings with attendants, offering their gifts to the Holy Family. Andrea's sculpture was similar in style to contemporary painting, but certain colours, such as red, could not be produced in tin-glaze. The coat-of-arms of the Albizzi, a prominent Florentine family, can be seen on the frame, and the relief was probably commissioned by them for a church not far from Florence. The shiny surface of the altarpiece would have reflected the candlelight in the chapel, bringing the image to life.\n\n"}

It was the first of the series of Greek bronze sculptures that the Aegean and Mediterranean yielded up in the twentieth century which have fundamentally altered the modern view of Ancient Greek sculpture. The wreck site, which is dated about 70–60 BC, also yielded the Antikythera Mechanism, an astronomical calculating device, a characterful head of a Stoic philosopher, and a hoard of coins. The coins included a disproportionate quantity of Pergamene cistophoric tetradrachms and Ephesian coins, leading scholars to surmise that it had begun its journey on the Ionian coast, perhaps at Ephesus; none of its recovered cargo has been identified as from mainland Greece.\n\nThe \"Ephebe\", which measures 1.96 meters , slightly over lifesize, was retrieved in numerous fragments. Its first restoration was revised in the 1950s, under the direction of Christos Karouzos, changing the focus of the eyes, the configuration of the abdomen, the connection between the torso and the right upper thigh and the position of the right arm; the re-restoration is universally considered a success.\n\nThe \"Ephebe\" does not correspond to any familiar iconographic model, and there are no known copies of the type. He held a spherical object in his right hand, and possibly may have represented Paris presenting the Apple of Discord to Aphrodite; however, since Paris is consistently depicted cloaked and with the distinctive Phrygian cap, other scholars have suggested a beardless, youthful Heracles with the Apple of the Hesperides. It has also been suggested that the youth is a depiction of Perseus holding the head of the slain Gorgon. It could also be the God Apollo, a \"Learned\" Hermes holding a caduceus and declaiming, an athlete holding some sort of prize (a spherical lekythion), or a sphere, a wreathe, a phiale, or an apple. The statue could even be the funerary statue of a young man. \n\nThe statue, dated to about 340-330 BC, is one of the most brilliant products of Peloponnesian bronze sculpture; the individuality and character it displays have encouraged speculation on its possible sculptor. It is, perhaps, the work of the famous sculptor Euphranor, trained in the Polyclitan tradition, who did make a sculpture of Paris, according to Pliny:By Euphranor is an Alexander [Paris]. This work is specially admired, because the eye can detect in it at once the judge of the goddesses, the lover of Helen, and yet the slayer of Achilles.\n\nThe \"Antikythera Youth\" is conserved in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens.\n\n"}

{"id": "93815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93815", "title": "Athanasius Kircher", "text": "Athanasius Kircher\n\nAthanasius Kircher, S.J. (sometimes erroneously spelled Kirchner; , 2 May 1602 – 28 November 1680) was a German Jesuit scholar and polymath who published around 40 major works, most notably in the fields of comparative religion, geology, and medicine. Kircher has been compared to fellow Jesuit Roger Boscovich and to Leonardo da Vinci for his enormous range of interests, and has been honored with the title \"Master of a Hundred Arts\". He taught for more than forty years at the Roman College, where he set up a wunderkammer. A resurgence of interest in Kircher has occurred within the scholarly community in recent decades.\n\nKircher claimed to have deciphered the hieroglyphic writing of the ancient Egyptian language, but most of his assumptions and translations in this field were later found to be incorrect. He did, however, correctly establish the link between the ancient Egyptian and the Coptic languages, and some commentators regard him as the founder of Egyptology. Kircher was also fascinated with Sinology and wrote an encyclopedia of China, in which he noted the early presence there of Nestorian Christians while also attempting to establish links with Egypt and Christianity.\n\nKircher's work in geology included studies of volcanoes and fossils. One of the first people to observe microbes through a microscope, Kircher was ahead of his time in proposing that the plague was caused by an infectious microorganism and in suggesting effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Kircher also displayed a keen interest in technology and mechanical inventions; inventions attributed to him include a magnetic clock, various automatons and the first megaphone. The invention of the magic lantern is often misattributed to Kircher, although he did conduct a study of the principles involved in his \"Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae\".\n\nA scientific star in his day, towards the end of his life he was eclipsed by the rationalism of René Descartes and others. In the late 20th century, however, the aesthetic qualities of his work again began to be appreciated. One modern scholar, Alan Cutler, described Kircher as \"a giant among seventeenth-century scholars\", and \"one of the last thinkers who could rightfully claim all knowledge as his domain\". Another scholar, Edward W. Schmidt, referred to Kircher as \"the last Renaissance man\". In \"A Man of Misconceptions,\" his 2012 book about Kircher, John Glassie writes that while \"many of Kircher's actual ideas today seem wildly off-base, if not simply bizarre,\" he was \"a champion of wonder, a man of awe-inspiring erudition and inventiveness,\" whose work was read \"by the smartest minds of the time.\"\n\nKircher was born on 2 May in either 1601 or 1602 (he himself did not know) in Geisa, Buchonia, near Fulda, currently Hesse, Germany. From his birthplace he took the epithets \"Bucho, Buchonius\" and \"Fuldensis\" which he sometimes added to his name. He attended the Jesuit College in Fulda from 1614 to 1618, when he entered the novitiate of the Society.\n\nThe youngest of nine children, Kircher studied volcanoes owing to his passion for rocks and eruptions. He was taught Hebrew by a rabbi in addition to his studies at school. He studied philosophy and theology at Paderborn, but fled to Cologne in 1622 to escape advancing Protestant forces. On the journey, he narrowly escaped death after falling through the ice crossing the frozen Rhine — one of several occasions on which his life was endangered. Later, traveling to Heiligenstadt, he was caught and nearly hanged by a party of Protestant soldiers. \n\nFrom 1622 to 1624 Kircher was sent to begin his regency period in Koblenz as a teacher. This was followed by his assignment to Heiligenstadt, where he taught mathematics, Hebrew and Syriac, and produced a show of fireworks and moving scenery for the visiting Elector Archbishop of Mainz, showing early evidence of his interest in mechanical devices. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1628 and became professor of ethics and mathematics at the University of Würzburg, where he also taught Hebrew and Syriac. Beginning in 1628, he also began to show an interest in Egyptian hieroglyphs.\n\nIn 1631, while still at Würzburg, Kircher allegedly had a prophetic vision of bright light and armed men with horses in the city. Wurzburg was shortly afterwards attacked and captured, leading to Kircher being accorded respect for predicting the disaster via astrology, though Kircher himself privately insisted that he had not relied on that art. This was the year that Kircher published his first book (the \"Ars Magnesia\", reporting his research on magnetism), but having been caught up in the Thirty Years' War he was driven to the papal University of Avignon in France. In 1633 he was called to Vienna by the emperor to succeed Kepler as Mathematician to the Habsburg court. On the intervention of Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc, the order was rescinded, and he was sent instead to Rome to continue with his scholarly work, but he had already embarked for Vienna.\n\nOn the way, his ship was blown off course and he arrived in Rome before he knew of the changed decision. He based himself in the city for the rest of his life, and from 1634 he taught mathematics, physics and Oriental languages at the Collegio Romano (now the Pontifical Gregorian University) for several years before being released to devote himself to research. He studied malaria and the plague, amassing a collection of antiquities, which he exhibited along with devices of his own creation in the Museum Kircherianum.\n\nIn 1661, Kircher discovered the ruins of a church said to have been constructed by Constantine on the site of Saint Eustace's vision of Jesus Christ in a stag's horns. He raised money to pay for the church's reconstruction as the \"Santuario della Mentorella\", and his heart was buried in the church on his death.\n\nKircher published a large number of substantial books on a very wide variety of subjects, such as Egyptology, geology, and music theory. His syncretic approach disregarded the boundaries between disciplines which are now conventional: his \"Magnes\", for example, was ostensibly a discussion of magnetism, but also explored other forms of attraction such as gravity and love. Perhaps Kircher's best-known work today is his \"Oedipus Aegyptiacus\" (1652–54), a vast study of Egyptology and comparative religion.\n\nHis books, written in Latin, were widely circulated in the 17th century, and they contributed to the dissemination of scientific information to a broader circle of readers. Kircher is not now considered to have made any significant original contributions, although a number of discoveries and inventions (e.g., the magic lantern) have sometimes been mistakenly attributed to him.\n\nIn his foreword to \"Ars Magna Sciendi Sive Combinatoria\" (The Great Art of Knowledge, or the Combinatorial Art), the inscription reads:\n\nThe last known example of Egyptian hieroglyphics dates from AD 394, after which all knowledge of hieroglyphics was lost. Until Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion found the key to hieroglyphics in the 19th century, the main authority was the 4th century Greek grammarian Horapollon, whose chief contribution was the misconception that hieroglyphics were \"picture writing\" and that future translators should look for symbolic meaning in the pictures.\n\nThe first modern study of hieroglyphics came with Piero Valeriano Bolzani's \"Hieroglyphica\" (1556), and Kircher was the most famous of the \"decipherers\" between ancient and modern times and the most famous Egyptologist of his day. In his \"Lingua Aegyptiaca Restituta\" (1643), Kircher called hieroglyphics \"this language hitherto unknown in Europe, in which there are as many pictures as letters, as many riddles as sounds, in short as many mazes to be escaped from as mountains to be climbed\". While some of his notions are long discredited, portions of his work have been valuable to later scholars, and Kircher helped pioneer Egyptology as a field of serious study.\n\nKircher's interest in Egyptology began in 1628 when he became intrigued by a collection of hieroglyphs in the library at Speyer. He learned Coptic in 1633 and published the first grammar of that language in 1636, the \"Prodromus coptus sive aegyptiacus\". Kircher then broke with Horapollon's interpretation of the language of the hieroglyphs with his \"Lingua aegyptiaca restituta\". Kircher argued that Coptic preserved the last development of ancient Egyptian. For this Kircher has been considered the true \"founder of Egyptology\", because his work was conducted \"before the discovery of the Rosetta Stone rendered Egyptian hieroglyphics comprehensible to scholars\". He also recognized the relationship between hieratic and hieroglyphic scripts.\n\nBetween 1650 and 1654, Kircher published four volumes of \"translations\" of hieroglyphs in the context of his Coptic studies. However, according to Steven Frimmer, \"none of them even remotely fitted the original texts\". In \"Oedipus Aegyptiacus\", Kircher argued under the impression of the \"Hieroglyphica\" that ancient Egyptian was the language spoken by Adam and Eve, that Hermes Trismegistus was Moses, and that hieroglyphs were occult symbols which \"cannot be translated by words, but expressed only by marks, characters and figures.\" This led him to translate simple hieroglyphic texts now known to read as \"ḏd Wsr\" (\"Osiris says\") as \"The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis; the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis\"\n\nAccording to the Egyptologist Sir E. A. Wallis Budge:\n\nAlthough Kircher's approach to deciphering texts was based on a fundamental misconception, some modern commentators have described Kircher as the pioneer of the serious study of hieroglyphs. The data which he collected were later consulted by Champollion in his successful efforts to decode the script. According to Joseph MacDonnell, it was \"because of Kircher's work that scientists knew what to look for when interpreting the Rosetta stone\". Another scholar of ancient Egypt, Erik Iversen, concluded:\nKircher was also actively involved in the erection of obelisks in Roman squares, often adding fantastic \"hieroglyphs\" of his design in the blank areas that are now puzzling to modern scholars. Rowland 2002 concluded that Kircher made use of Pythagorean principles to read hieroglyphs of the Pamphili Obelisk, and used the same form of interpretation when reading scripture.\n\nKircher had an early interest in China, telling his superior in 1629 that he wished to become a missionary to that country. In 1667 he published a treatise whose full title was \"China monumentis, qua sacris qua profanis, nec non variis naturae & artis spectaculis, aliarumque rerum memorabilium argumentis illustrata\", and which is commonly known simply as \"China Illustrata\", i.e. \"China Illustrated\". It was a work of encyclopedic breadth, combining material of unequal quality, from accurate cartography to mythical elements, such as a study of dragons. The work drew heavily on the reports of Jesuits working in China, in particular Michael Boym and Martino Martini.\n\n\"China Illustrata\" emphasized the Christian elements of Chinese history, both real and imagined: the book noted the early presence of Nestorian Christians (with a Latin translation of the Nestorian Stele of Xi'an provided by Boym and his Chinese collaborator, Andrew Zheng), but also claimed that the Chinese were descended from the sons of Ham, that Confucius was Hermes Trismegistus/Moses and that the Chinese characters were abstracted hieroglyphs.\n\nIn Kircher's system, ideograms were inferior to hieroglyphs because they referred to specific ideas rather than to mysterious complexes of ideas, while the signs of the Maya and Aztecs were yet lower pictograms which referred only to objects. Umberto Eco comments that this idea reflected and supported the ethnocentric European attitude toward Chinese and native American civilizations;\n\n\"China was presented not as an unknown barbarian to be defeated but as a prodigal son who should return to the home of the common father\". (p. 69)\n\nIn 1675, he published \"Arca Noë\", the results of his research on the biblical Ark of Noah — following the Counter-Reformation, allegorical interpretation was giving way to the study of the Old Testament as literal truth among Scriptural scholars. Kircher analyzed the dimensions of the Ark; based on the number of species known to him (excluding insects and other forms thought to arise spontaneously), he calculated that overcrowding would not have been a problem. He also discussed the logistics of the Ark voyage, speculating on whether extra livestock was brought to feed carnivores and what the daily schedule of feeding and caring for animals must have been.\n\nKircher was sent the Voynich Manuscript in 1666 by Johannes Marcus Marci in the hope of Kircher being able to decipher it. The manuscript remained in the Collegio Romano until Victor Emmanuel II of Italy annexed the Papal States in 1870, though scepticism as to the authenticity of the story and of the origin of the manuscript itself exists. In his \"Polygraphia nova\" (1663), Kircher proposed an artificial universal language.\n\nOn a visit to southern Italy in 1638, the ever-curious Kircher was lowered into the crater of Vesuvius, then on the brink of eruption, to examine its interior. He was also intrigued by the subterranean rumbling which he heard at the Strait of Messina. His geological and geographical investigations culminated in his \"Mundus Subterraneus\" of 1664, in which he suggested that the tides were caused by water moving to and from a subterranean ocean.\n\nKircher was also puzzled by fossils. He understood that fossils were the remains of animals. He ascribed large bones to giant races of humans. Not all the objects which he was attempting to explain were in fact fossils, hence the diversity of explanations. He interpreted mountain ranges as the Earth's skeletal structures exposed by weathering.\n\n\"Mundus Subterraneus\" includes several pages about the legendary island of Atlantis including a map with the Latin caption \"Situs Insulae Atlantidis, a Mari olim absorpte ex mente Egyptiorum et Platonis descriptio.\" translating as \"Site of the island of Atlantis, in the sea, from Egyptian sources and Plato's description.\"\n\nIn his book \"Arca Noë\", Kircher argued that after the Flood new species were transformed as they moved into different environments, for example, when a deer moved into a colder climate, it became a reindeer. Additionally, he held that many species were hybrids of other species, for example, armadillos from a combination of turtles and porcupines. He also advocated the theory of spontaneous generation. Because of such hypotheses, some historians have held that Kircher was a proto-evolutionist.\n\nKircher took a notably modern approach to the study of diseases, as early as 1646 using a microscope to investigate the blood of plague victims. In his \"Scrutinium Pestis\" of 1658, he noted the presence of \"little worms\" or \"animalcules\" in the blood and concluded that the disease was caused by microorganisms. The conclusion was correct, although it is likely that what he saw were in fact red or white blood cells and not the plague agent, Yersinia pestis. He also proposed hygienic measures to prevent the spread of disease, such as isolation, quarantine, burning clothes worn by the infected and wearing facemasks to prevent the inhalation of germs.\n\nIn 1646, Kircher published \"Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae\", on the subject of the display of images on a screen using an apparatus similar to the magic lantern as developed by Christiaan Huygens and others. Kircher described the construction of a \"catotrophic lamp\" that used reflection to project images on the wall of a darkened room. Although Kircher did not invent the device, he made improvements over previous models, and suggested methods by which exhibitors could use his device. Much of the significance of his work arises from Kircher's rational approach towards the demystification of projected images.\n\nPreviously such images had been used in Europe to mimic supernatural appearances (Kircher himself cites the use of displayed images by the rabbis in the court of King Solomon). Kircher stressed that exhibitors should take great care to inform spectators that such images were purely naturalistic, and not magical in origin.\n\nKircher also constructed a magnetic clock, the mechanism of which he explained in his \"Magnes\" (1641). The device had originally been invented by another Jesuit, Fr. Linus of Liege, and was described by an acquaintance of Line's in 1634. Kircher's patron Peiresc had claimed that the clock's motion supported the Copernican cosmological model, the argument being that the magnetic sphere in the clock was caused to rotate by the magnetic force of the sun.\n\nKircher's model disproved the hypothesis, showing that the motion could be produced by a water clock in the base of the device. Although Kircher wrote against the Copernican model in his \"Magnes\", supporting instead that of Tycho Brahe, his later \"Itinerarium exstaticum\" (1656, revised 1671), presented several systems — including the Copernican — as distinct possibilities. The clock has been reconstructed by Caroline Bouguereau in collaboration with Michael John Gorman and is on display at the Green Library at Stanford University.\n\nThe \"Musurgia Universalis\" (1650) sets out Kircher's views on music: he believed that the harmony of music reflected the proportions of the universe. The book includes plans for constructing water-powered automatic organs, notations of birdsong and diagrams of musical instruments. One illustration shows the differences between the ears of humans and other animals. In \"Phonurgia Nova\" (1673) Kircher considered the possibilities of transmitting music to remote places.\n\nOther machines designed by Kircher include an aeolian harp, automatons such as a statue which spoke and listened via a speaking tube, a perpetual motion machine, and a Katzenklavier (\"cat piano\"). The last of these would have driven spikes into the tails of cats, which would yowl to specified pitches, although Kircher is not known to have actually constructed the instrument.\n\nIn \"Phonurgia Nova\", literally new methods of sound production, Kircher examined acoustic phenomena. He explores the use of horns and cones in amplifying sound with architectural applications. He also examines the phenomena of echoes in rooms with domes of different shapes including the muffling effect of an elliptical dome from Heidelberg. In one section he also explores the therapeutic effects of music especially in tarantism, a theme from southern Italy.\n\nAlthough Kircher's work was not mathematically based, he did develop various systems for generating and counting all combinations of a finite collection of objects (i.e., a finite set), based on the previous work of Ramon Llull. His methods and diagrams are discussed in \"Ars Magna Sciendi, sive Combinatoria\", 1669. They include what may be the first recorded drawings of complete bipartite graphs, extending a similar technique used by Llull to visualize complete graphs. Kircher also employed combinatorics in his Arca Musarithmica, an aleatoric music composition device capable of producing millions of church hymns by combining randomly selected musical phrases.\n\nFor most of his professional life, Kircher was one of the scientific stars of his world: according to historian Paula Findlen, he was \"the first scholar with a global reputation\". His importance was twofold: to the results of his own experiments and research he added information gleaned from his correspondence with over 760 scientists, physicians and above all his fellow Jesuits in all parts of the globe. The \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" calls him a \"one-man intellectual clearing house\". His works, illustrated to his orders, were extremely popular, and he was the first scientist to be able to support himself through the sale of his books. His near exact contemporary, the English philosopher-physician, Sir Thomas Browne (1605–82) collected his books avidly while his eldest son Edward Browne in 1665 visited the Jesuit priest resident at Rome. Towards the end of Kircher's life however, his stock fell, as the rationalist Cartesian approach began to dominate (Descartes himself described Kircher as \"more quacksalver than savant\").\n\nKircher was largely neglected until the late 20th century. One writer attributes his rediscovery to the similarities between his eclectic approach and postmodernism.\n\nAs few of Kircher's works have been translated, the contemporary emphasis has been on their aesthetic qualities rather than their actual content, and a succession of exhibitions have highlighted the beauty of their illustrations. Historian Anthony Grafton has said that \"the staggeringly strange dark continent of Kircher's work [is] the setting for a Borges story that was never written\", while Umberto Eco has written about Kircher in his novel \"The Island of the Day Before\", as well as in his non-fiction works \"The Search for the Perfect Language\" and \"Serendipities\". In \"Where Tigers Are At Home\", by Jean-Marie Blas de Roblès, the protagonist works on a translation of a bogus 17th century biography of Kircher.

These symbols often appear in yellow and red. The flag of the Soviet Union incorporated a yellow-outlined red star and a yellow hammer and sickle on red. The flags of Vietnam, China, North Korea, Angola and Mozambique would all incorporate similar symbolism under communist rule.\n\nThe hammer and sickle have become the pan-communist symbol, appearing on the flags of most communist parties around the world. However, the flag of the Workers' Party of Korea includes a hammer representing industrial workers, a hoe representing agricultural workers and a brush (traditional writing-implement) representing the intelligentsia.\n\nIn Hungary, Latvia, Indonesia, Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania, communist symbols are banned and displays in public for non-educational use are considered a criminal offense.\n\nAlthough there isn't any direct attribution, a contemporaneous large empire within Europe was the Ottoman Empire, which fashioned a flag with a red background, and a crescent with a five pointed star, as early as 1793 for Ottoman ships, and 1844 for all Ottoman flags, predating Karl Marx Communist associated works publishing by 4 years (1848). The superficial resemblance of Ottoman flags to Communist state flags in color, simplicity, and symbolism are rather striking given the lack of relation of doctrine.\n\nThe hammer stands for the industrial working class and the sickle represents the agricultural workers, therefore together they represent the unity of the two groups.\n\nThe hammer and sickle were first used during the 1917 Russian Revolution, but it did not become the official symbol of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic until 1924. Since the Russian Revolution, the hammer and sickle have come to represent various communist parties and communist states.\n\nThe five-pointed red star is a symbol of communism as well as broader socialism in general. The red star was a revolutionary symbol after the October Revolution and following civil war in Russia. It was widely used by anti-fascist resistance parties and underground organizations in Europe leading up to and during World War II. During the war, the red star was prominently used as a symbol of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army from the Soviet Union, which liberated its country from the invading forces of Nazi Germany and went on to rid the rest of Eastern Europe from the fascist occupation forces, achieving absolute victory and ending the war at the Battle of Berlin. Most states in the Eastern Bloc incorporated the red star into state symbols to signify their socialist nature.\n\nWhile there is no known original allegory behind the red star beyond being a universal political symbol, in the Soviet Union the red star gained a more precise symbolism as representing the Communist Party and its position on the flag over the united hammer and sickle symbolised the party leading the Soviet working class in the building of communism. Today, the red star is used by many socialist and communist parties and organizations across the world.\n\nThe red flag is often seen in combination with other communist symbols and party names. The flag is used at various communist and socialist rallies like May Day, or used in a red bloc. The flag, being a symbol of socialism itself, is also commonly associated with non-communist variants of socialism.\n\nThe red flag has had multiple meanings in history, but it was first used as a flag of defiance. The red flag gained its modern association with communism in the 1871 French Revolution. After the October Revolution, the Soviet government adopted the red flag with a superimposed hammer and sickle as its national flag. Since the October Revolution, various socialist states and movements have used the red flag.\n\nThe red and black flag has been a symbol of general communist movements, usually anarchist. The flag was used as the symbol of the anarcho-syndicalists during the Spanish Civil War. The black represents anarchism and the red represents leftist and socialist ideals. Over time, the flag spilled into statist leftist movements, these movements include the Sandinistas and the 26th of July Movement, where the flags colors are not divided diagonally, but horizontally. As in the case of the Sandinistas, they adopted the flag due to the movement's anarchist roots.\n\n\"The Internationale\" is an anthem of the Communist movement. It is one of the most universally recognized songs in the world and has been translated into nearly every spoken language. Its original French refrain is \"C'est la lutte finale\"/\"Groupons-nous et demain\"/\"L'Internationale\"/\"Sera le genre humain\" (English: This is the final struggle/Let's group together and tomorrow/The International/Will be the human race). It is often sung with a raised fist salute.\n\nThe song has been used by communists all over the world since it was composed in the 19th century and adopted as the official anthem of the Second International. It later became the anthem of Soviet Russia in 1918 and of the Soviet Union in 1922. It was superseded as the Soviet Union anthem in 1944 with the adoption of the State Anthem of the Soviet Union, which placed more emphasis on patriotism. The song was also sung in defiance to Communist governments, such as in the German Democratic Republic in 1989 prior to reunification as well as in the People's Republic of China during the Tienanmen Square protests of the same year.\n\nAlthough not an exclusively communist symbol, the Plough, or Starry Plough, is a symbol of Irish socialism. It may have the same roots as the original hammer and Plough that was replaced by the hammer and sickle in Soviet Russia. The significance of the banner was that a free Workers Republic of Ireland would control its own destiny from the plough to the stars and the sword forged into the plough would mean the redundancy of war with the establishment of a socialist International. The flag depicts the Big Dipper, part of the constellation of Ursa Major that is known as \"The Plough\" in Ireland and Great Britain. The Plough is one of the most prominent features of the night sky over Ireland throughout the year. This was unveiled in 1914 and flown by the socialist workers' militia (the Irish Citizen Army) during the 1916 Easter Rising.\nIn China, the Plough flag (), a red flag with white or yellow plough, is widely used in the period of the First Revolutionary Civil War as the flag of the Chinese peasant associations, an organization led by the Communist Party of China. It is believed that Peng Pai () was the first user in 1923 at the peasants' association of Hailufeng. The Plough flag has many different versions and some are combined with the flag of Blue Sky, White Sun or Red Field; other are different on the details of the plough.\n\nMany communist governments purposely diverged from the traditional forms of European heraldry in order to distance themselves from the monarchies that they usually replaced, with actual coats of arms being seen as symbols of the monarchs. Instead, they followed the pattern of the national emblems adopted in the late 1910s and early 1920s in Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union.\n\nSocialist heraldry, also called communist heraldry, is a colloquial name for the common design patterns of the national emblems adopted by communist states. Although commonly called coats of arms, most such devices are not actually coats of arms in the traditional heraldic sense, but the recognisable common patterns have led to the use of the unofficial term \"socialist heraldry\".\n\nWhile not necessarily communist in nature, the following graphic elements are often incorporated into the flags, seals and propaganda of communist countries and movements.\n\nNotable examples of communist states that use no overtly communist imagery on their flags, emblems or other graphic representations are Cuba and the former Polish People's Republic.\n\nExamples of these symbols in use.\n\n\n\n"}

Some of the loyalists looked down on the original white Bahamians and called them \"conchs\", possibly because shellfish was a prominent part of their diet.\n\nSome other theories that have been proposed for the origin of the term are:\n\nBy extension, the term \"Conch\" has also been applied to the descendants of Bahamian immigrants in Florida. Bahamians began visiting the Florida Keys in the 18thcentury to catch turtles, cut timber, and salvage wrecks. During the 19thcentury and the first half of the 20thcentury, most of the permanent residents in the Florida Keys outside of Key West, and many in Key West, were Bahamian in origin. \"Conch\" was reported to be a term of \"distinction\" for Bahamians in Key West in the 1880s.\n\nThe white Bahamians in the keys continued to be known as \"conchs\". A WPA produced \"Guide to Florida\" noted that both 'Conchs' and black Bahamians in Key West spoke with a \"Cockney accent\". Other residents of the Florida Keys, especially in Key West, began applying the term \"Conch\" to themselves, and it is now applied generally to all residents of Key West. See: Conch Republic. To distinguish between natives and non-natives, the terms \"Salt Water Conch\" (native) and \"Fresh Water Conch\" (non-native) have been used. Newcomers become \"Fresh Water Conchs\" after seven years.\n\nRiviera Beach, Florida, was known as \"Conchtown\" in the first half of the 20thcentury because of the number of Bahamian immigrants who settled there. Unlike the situation in Key West and the rest of the Florida Keys, where being \"Conch\" became a matter of pride and community identification, \"Conch\" was used by outsiders (in particular the residents of West Palm Beach) in a pejorative manner to describe the Bahamian community in Riviera Beach. The usage there also carried the connotation that at least some of the \"Conchs\" were of mixed racial heritage. As a result, some of the Bahamians in Riviera Beach denied being \"Conchs\" when interviewed by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) Florida Writers Project in the late 1930s. WPA worker Veronica Huss (with assistance from Stetson Kennedy) and photographer Charles Foster wrote a book on the Conchs and their culture entitled \"Conch Town,\" but the WPA chose not to publish it (Foster eventually published a version in 1991). Many Bahamians also settled in Miami, particularly in the Coconut Grove neighborhood, and in Tarpon Springs.\n\nThe term \"Conchy Joe\" is also sometimes used to refer to a native Bahamian of European descent or a person of non-European or mixed descent who \"acts white\".\n\n\n"}

In Gestalt psychology it is known as identifying a \"figure\" from the back\"ground\". For example, you see words on a printed paper as the \"figure\" and the white sheet as the \"background\".\n\nThe most famous example of figure–ground perception is probably the faces–vase drawing that Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin described. This drawing exemplifies one of the key aspects of figure–ground organization, edge-assignment and its effect on shape perception. Notice in the faces/vase drawing, the perceived shape depends critically on the direction in which the border (edge) between the black and white regions is assigned. If the two curvy edges between the black and white regions are assigned inward then the central white region is seen as a vase shape in front of a black background. No faces are perceived in this case. On the other hand, if the edges are assigned outwards, then the two black profile faces are perceived on a white background and no vase shape is perceived. The human visual system will then settle on either of the interpretations of the Rubin vase and alternate between them. Functional brain imaging shows that when people see the Rubin image as a face, there is activity in the temporal lobe, specifically in the face-selective region \n\nHow does the brain decide in a visual scene which item is the figure and which are part of the ground? This perceptual decision can be based on many cues, all of which are of a probabilistic nature. For instance, size helps us distinguish between the figure and the ground, since smaller regions are often (but not always) figures. Object shape can help us distinguish figure from ground, because figures tend to be convex. Movement also helps; the figure may be moving against a static environment. Color is also a cue, because the background tends to continue as one color behind potentially multiple foreground figures, whose colors may vary. Edge assignment also helps; if the edge belongs to the figure, it defines the shape while the background exists behind the shape. But it's at times difficult to distinguish between the two because the edge that would separate figure from ground is really part of neither, it equally defines both the figure and the background.\n\nEvidently, the process of distinguishing figure from ground (sometimes called figure–ground segmentation) is inherently probabilistic, and the best that the brain can do is to take all relevant cues into account in order to generate a probabilistic best-guess. In this light, Bayesian figure–ground segmentation models have been proposed to simulate the probabilistic inference by which the brain may distinguish figure from ground.\n\nFigure–ground organization is used to help artists and designers in composition of a 2D piece. Figure–ground reversal may be used as an intentional visual design technique in which an existing image's foreground and background colors are purposely swapped to create new images.\n\nFigure–ground perception can be expanded from visual perception to include abstract (i.e. non-visual) concepts such as melody/harmony, subject/background and positive/negative space. The concept of figure and ground fully depends on the observer and not on the item itself.\n\nThere are three types of figure–ground problems:\n\n\n"}

Fukiishi are thought to be one element of the characteristics of the period of kofun at the time that they were making their first appearance; what are thought of as the oldest examples of what was to lead the generally fixed form are seen at and the presumed slightly older in the city of Sakurai in Nara Prefecture. Neither fukiishi nor haniwa accompany mounds from before regularization such as at the .\n\nThe ' () seen at the (\"four corner projections type grave mound\") in the San'in region in Western Japan are often put forth as an ancestor of '. The perimeter of the foot of kofun No. 3 of in Izumo in Shimane Prefecture is completely covered with \"\". The burial mound at the archaeological site in the city of Sōja in Okayama Prefecture is surrounded with rows of stones; such examples are widely seen in the San'in and the nearby San'yō regions, where examples of burial mounds demarcated by stacks of stone walls are also seen.\n\nIn his report on an excavation in 1915 on mound No. 21 of Saitobaru kofungun burial mound group in what is now the city of Saito in Miyazaki Prefecture, historian titled an entry ' (\"surface roofing stones\") in which he described the condition of the ' in a ground plan and cross-section.\n\nThe term ' came into use as an archaeological term largely due to the influence of book ' (\"Kofun and ancient culture\", 1922). Via examples of kofun in the Kinai capital region Takashi described the \"\" there as serving both practical and decorative purposes: in practical terms the use of pebbles provided protection from the wind, rain, and cold, while the stones served to beautify the mound which was after all built above ground to attract public attention and to impress and rouse piety in visiting worshippers.\n\nExcavation of fukiishi themselves was nearly nonexistent before World War II. It was only after the war that scientific examination, verification, and surveying of the stones took place.\n\nIn 1953, led a group of specialists, locals, and students in an excavation at the in Misaki in Okayama. The group surveyed three quarters of the kofun, with a height of 10 m and a diameter of 60 m. The report published in 1960 gave the extent of distribution, shape and size, petrological analysis, technical analysis of the roofing method, and minute illustration the configuration of the individual stones. The report estimated the number of stones at about 80,000.\n\nIn response to the rapid increase in the post-war period of large-scale development that led to in the destruction of historical ruins, urgent excavations were carried out with the goal of thorough examination rather than as the preservation of documentation. As a result of this early research, Shōzō Haraguchi and published a paper in 1967 on the excavation of tumulus C1 of the Bentenyama kofungun group in Takatsuki in Osaka. The paper notes the results of investigation into the stacking methods, the weight and number of stones per unit area, the collection areas and transportation routes of the stones, and other details. stated that following this report hardly any other resulting from such an accumulation of verifiable details on fukiishi has appeared.\n\nResearch into fukiishi has come to require knowledge related to construction technology. To enable the scientific qualification and quantification of research documentation, Hisanori Ishizuka has called for research on:\n\n\nThe material for fukiishi was often made up of pebbles and stones from dry riverbeds. In the case of pebbles, a variety of stones was used. For example, the late-4th-century in Kashiwara in Osaka Prefecture was made with andesite flagstones in vertical or sloped piles. Other sites used chert, sandstone, slate, basalt, or other types of stone.\n\nEmbankments were often made with soil transported from other areas. Pollen analysis of the fifth- and sixth-century kofuns of the Kuboizumi-Maruyama Historic Sites in Saga has shown clear disparities in the vegetation in the soil of the mound faces and that of the surrounding environment. This example suggests that the borrow pits for the construction of the mounds were in remote locations.\n\nAmong different methods of stone tomb construction, it was found that there are four different classifications of burial mound structures.\n\nThese buildings include a stacked stone wall with thick backfill and lack a base stone in the construction. The typical examples of burials in this style are Nakayama Otsuka Kofun (Nara Prefecture Tenri City), Hokeno Mountain Burial Mound (Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture), and in the rear section of the former Inari Tomaru, Kyoto, these are the oldest structures still present in Yamato.\n\nThis construction method is characterized by the dual-staged stacking of the stone base. The basal stone is stacked horizontally and the subsequent masonry is stacked on top. These mounds tend to exhibit steep inclines of 30 degrees or more. Prime examples of this type of burial mound are found in Red Tsuchiyama Tumulus in the Tenri City of Nara Prefecture and Xizhiduka Mound and the Miwa Mountain Burial Mound 1 in Tsuyama City Okayama Prefecture.\n\n\"Stacking Stone\" is the classification of this type of stone, the basement stones are overlapped with the main body of the structure. The Benten Mountain Mound (C1) in Takatsuki City, Osaka Prefecture is a representative example of this style of mound building.\nThis type of burial mound does not stack stone layers over the foundation. Instead, the stones are embedded in the soil in a method referred to as \"pasting stones\".\n\nConstruction technology changes as current methods fuse with local methods. Examples of this can be found in Kashiwabara City at Mt Tama 1 and Tama 7 (Tamane Mountain Burial Mounds).\n\nThis method of construction follows the \"paste stone\" method in Class 3-2. Mounds generally displays shallow inclines of 20-25 degrees. The mounds consist mostly of small stones with gravel filled gaps; which is generally found in the Saki Gouzanyama Kofun (Saki Gouran Mountain Burial Mound) in Nara City, Nara Prefecture.\n\nThe purpose of ' is seen, as in Kenji Takahashi's account of 1922, to protect the burial mound while projecting its majesty. As they were used primarily on slopes and rarely on flat surfaces it is also thought they may have served to prevent runoff, and may have contributed to waterproofing and drainage. They may also have been used to imply the mound was sacred, holy ground and clearly differentiate it from adjacent areas. Archaeologist notes the use of ' may be related to a desire to make royalty visible and exhibit the people's connection with royalty, a feature he sees as characteristic of Japanese burial mounds in comparison with those of other Asian countries, and in particular in the case of keyhole-shaped kofun.\n\nThe scale of kofun construction peaked in the middle of the Kofun period in the mid-5th century, reflecting the power and influence of the political structure and the social status of the entombed via the form and scale of the tumuli. Towards the close of the 5th century, the construction of large keyhole-shaped kofun and groups of layered kofun waned.\n\nAt the beginning of the 6th century, the scale of most keyhole-shaped kofun west from the Kantō region became smaller, the smaller (\"satellite\") tumuli began to disappear, and fukiishi began to be used infrequently. Three-tiered kofun saw a strong decrease in favour of two-tiered ones. Outside of the Kantō region, haniwa stopped being used. From the end of the 6th century to the beginning of the 7th, the tumuli of the monarchs changed from square \"hōfun\" tumuli to octagonal tumuli. Amongst these, dome-shaped grave mounds made with fukiishi, such as in Fuchū in Tokyo, are noteworthy. Nevertheless, during this era kofun were quickly ceding the role of central ritual building to Buddhist temples, and the adoption of rammed earth construction techniques stands out.\n\nWith regards to , ' stones lined up to trace the line of the mound are recognized, and what could be called \"fukiishi\" are almost never seen. ' were not piled on the mounds as \"fukiishi\" were, nor were the construction techniques of \"fukiishi\" applied to them. Aoki has pointed out that this was modeled on the decoration techniques of the foundations of Buddhist temples.\n\n\n"}

As of 2005, only two states — New Jersey and Utah — still paid cash welfare benefits to childless adults deemed \"able-bodied\" (many other states do allow such payments to be made if a disability is demonstrated). In any event, the person(s) seeking General Assistance must first apply for any other programs — state or federal — for which alternate eligibility may or may not exist; only if all such applications are denied is the applicant then permitted to receive General Assistance benefits, which usually include food stamps, and often, assistance in paying for rental housing.\n\nIn some states, General Assistance programs are not universal, and the policies of different counties or cities therein may differ widely. California is such a state; San Francisco once paid the most generous benefits in the state, but these were drastically reduced after Gavin Newsom was elected mayor of that city in 2003, on a controversial platform known as \"Care Not Cash.\"\n\nMany jurisdictions use the alternate name \"General Relief,\" including a large number of California counties (among them Los Angeles County), as well as the states of Iowa and Virginia. Alaska calls its program \"General Relief Assistance.\"\n\nSince 1933, California law has required counties to provide relief to the poor, including health care services and general assistance. The California Welfare and Institutions Code provides that:\n\nIt has been said that the \"provision of general assistance is inconsistent, fragmented, and widely differentiated\", with aid ranging from $160 per month in Santa Barbara County to $360 in neighboring Ventura County. Los Angeles County has the largest number of general assistance recipients in California and gives aid of $221 per month.\n\nCalifornia has provided some form of general assistance since the mid-1800s, and much of the language can be traced back to the Pauper Act of 1901. San Francisco Proposition N of 2002, colloquially known as Care Not Cash, was a San Francisco ballot measure sponsored by Gavin Newsom designed to cut the money given in the General Assistance programs to homeless people in exchange for shelters and other forms of services.\n\n"}

Topless freedom laws are celebrated and protests are held in states where topless women are prohibited.\n\nThe annual event was started in 2007 by Go Topless, a Nevada group formed by Claude Vorilhon, leader of the Raelian Movement, a UFO religion. GoTopless has supported events and chapters in other countries.\n\nGo Topless Day was founded in response to the arrest of Phoenix Feeley (Jill Coccaro), a topless activist who was arrested for being topless in public in New York in 2005. The city of New York settled with Feeley for $29,000 because toplessness is legal there.\n\nGo Topless Day is scheduled for the Sunday nearest August 26, Women's Equality Day, since on that day in 1920 women's suffrage was approved (in 1971 the U.S. Congress declared the day to be Women's Equality Day). The event encourages women to go topless in public, and men to cover their chests by wearing brassieres or bikinis.\n\nIn 2008, the first Go Topless Day was organized.\n\nIn 2009, National Go Topless Day was celebrated on August 23 in the United States.\n\nIn 2011, Go Topless Day in the US was held on August 24. Protesters, both men and women, participated in rallies held in twelve U.S. states, including California, New York and North Carolina. Women who participated in the celebration used either fake latex nipples or pasties to cover their nipples and avoid arrest due to laws in some states that prohibit women from showing their areola and nipples in public. The protesters displayed signs that read \"Men and women have nipples. Why should women hide theirs?\" and \"Equal topless rights for all or none\". Many men who joined the demonstration wore bras and bikinis to protest against the double standard where men are allowed to go bare chested, but women are prohibited to go topless in public.\n\nIn 2011, Go Topless Day was celebrated for the first time in Canada. The 2011 Canadian Go Topless Day rally was held in Toronto, Ontario, on August 28. Nearly twenty women went topless going from Queen Street East to Kew Beach on a pick-up truck sounding loudly the song \"Revolution\" by The Beatles. According to Diane Brisbois, the spokesperson for Go Topless Canada, \"This is not a beauty contest. It is about freedom. We have support; there are many men who come to our events too.\"\n\nWomen in Canada won the right to bare their breasts in public in 1996 when the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned the 1991 conviction of Gwen Jacob, saying \"there was nothing degrading or dehumanizing\" about her decision to take off her shirt in public.\"\n\nIn 2011, topless women congregated in Bryant Park in New York City on Go Topless Day, while men mostly observed. 30 cities held demonstrations in the US.\n\nIn 2013, Go Topless Day in the US was held on August 25 and marked the 6th anniversary of the event. There were demonstrations in 40 cities. Men who support the group's mission were asked to cover their own man-boobs with pasties or bras.\n\nIn 2014, Go Topless Day in the US was held on August 24. It was the 7th annual Go Topless Day.\n\nIn 2015, Go Topless Day in the US was held on August 23. It was the 8th annual Go Topless Day. In Edinburgh, approximately 50 people protested on the Royal Mile for two hours.\n\nIn 2016, Go Topless Day in the US was held on August 28. It was the 9th annual Go Topless Day.\n\n"}
{"id": "669366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=669366", "title": "György Konrád", "text": "György Konrád\n\nGyörgy (George) Konrád (born 2 April 1933) is a Hungarian novelist and essayist, known as an advocate of individual freedom.\n\nGeorge Konrad (he prefers the English version of his name in translations) was born in Berettyóújfalu, near Debrecen into an affluent Jewish family. His father, József Konrád, was a successful hardware merchant; his mother, Róza Klein, came from the Nagyvárad Jewish middle class. His sister Éva was born in 1930. \n\nAfter the German occupation of Hungary, the Gestapo and Hungarian gendarmerie arrested his parents and deported them to Austria. The two children, together with two cousins, managed with difficulty to procure travel permits enabling them to visit their relatives in Budapest. The following day, every Jewish inhabitant of Berettyóújfalu was deported to the ghetto in Nagyvárad, and from there to Auschwitz. Konrád's classmates were, almost without exception, all killed in Birkenau. The two children and their cousins survived the Holocaust in a safe house under Swiss sponsorship. \n\nAt the end of February 1945, Eva and George returned to Berettyóújfalu. In June 1945, their parents returned home from deportation, and the Konrád family ultimately survived intact, the only such family among the some 1000 Jewish inhabitants of Berettyóújfalu. Konrad began his studies in 1946 at the Main Reformed Gimnázium in Debrecen, and from 1947 to 1951, he attended the Madách Gimnázium in Budapest, where he was graduated in 1951, and entered the Lenin Institute where he studied literature, sociology and psychology. Eötvös Loránd University. By 1950, when the state appropriated the father's business and the family residence at Berettyóújfalu, the Konráds returned there, while Konrad completed his university education in the Department of Hungarian literature and language at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest.\n\nIn 1956 Konrad participated in the Hungarian Uprising against the Soviet occupation, during which he served in the National Guard, which drew its ranks from university students. He moved through the city with a machine gun, motivated by curiosity more than anything else. He never used his weapon. His friends, his sister and his cousins emigrated to the West. Konrád chose to remain in Hungary. The story of Konrád's survival as a child is told in his autobiographical novel \"Departure and Return\" (Hungarian version 2001).\n\nHe made his living through ad hoc jobs: he was a tutor, wrote reader reports, translated, and worked as a factory hand. Beginning in the summer of 1959, he secured steady employment as a children's welfare supervisor in Budapest's seventh District. He remained there for seven years, during which time he amassed the experiences that would serve as the basis for his novel \"The Case Worker\" (1969). The book drew a vigorous and mixed response: the official criticism was negative, but the book quickly became very popular and sold out in days. \nBetween 1960 and 1965 Konrad was employed as a reader at the Magyar Helikon publishing house, where he was chief editor of works by Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Babel, and Balzac. In 1965, he joined the Urban Science and Planning Institute, there undertaking research in urban sociology with the sociological research group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He was working closely with urban sociologist Iván Szelényi with whom they wrote a book \"On the Sociological Problems of the New Housing Developments\" (1969) and two extensive works on the management of the country’s regional zones, as well as on urbanistic and ecological trends in Hungary.\n\nHis experiences as an urbanist provided material for his next novel, \"The City Builder\", in which he radically extended the experiments in language and form that marked \"The Case Worker\". \"The City Builder\" was allowed to appear in Hungarian only in censored form from Magvető Publishers in 1977. It was published abroad by Suhrkamp, Seuil, Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch, and Philip Roth’s Penguin Series, with a foreword by Carlos Fuentes. Konrád lost his job by order of the political police in July 1973. For half a year he worked as a nurse’s aide at the work-therapy-based mental institution at Doba.\n\nTogether with Iván Szelényi, Konrád published \"The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power\" in 1974. Shortly after the completion of \"The Intellectuals\" intended for foreign publication, the political police bugged and searched Szelényi’s and Konrád’s apartments. A significant part of Konrád’s diaries were confiscated and the authors were arrested for incitement against the state. They were placed on probation and informed that they would be permitted to emigrate with their families. Szelényi accepted the offer, while Konrád remained in Hungary, choosing internal emigration and all that it entailed. A smuggled manuscript of \"The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power\" was published abroad and remains on university reading lists to this day. \nHe published in Hungarian samizdat and by publishers in the West. Virtually from this period until 1989, Konrád was a forbidden author in Hungary, deprived of all legal income. He made a living from honoraria abroad. His works were placed in restricted sections in libraries. Naturally he was also forbidden to speak on radio or television. When the restriction of travel expired in 1976, Konrád spent a year in Berlin on a DAAD fellowship, and another year in the U.S, on a stipend of his American publisher. During this period, he wrote his novel \"The Loser\". \nBetween 1977 and 1982, two volumes of Konrád’s essays appeared: \"The Temptation of Autonomy\" (not translated into English) and \"Antipolitics\". These works called into question the European political status quo. \"Antipolitics\" portrayed the Yalta Agreement and the spheres of influence system as the potential cause of a possible Third World War. The book’s subtitle was Central-European Meditations, and it was to become one of the voices demanding that region’s secession from the Soviet bloc as a requisite for peace in Europe. Konrád was one of the first to predict the imminent disappearance of the Iron Curtain. In 1984, he read his essay \"Does the Dream of Central Europe Still Exist?\" in the Schwarzenberg Palace as he received the Herder Prize from the University of Vienna. Critics have compared his essays to the writings of Adam Michnik, Milan Kundera, Václav Havel, Czeslaw Milos and Danilo Kiš.\n\nThe years between 1973 and 1989 witnessed the evolution of a dissident political and artistic subculture, independent of official culture. Konrád was one of the determining voices in the democratic opposition. His works appeared in the underground so called samizdat journals of the opposition. In interviews given to Radio Free Europe, Konrad’s ideas reached a wider Hungarian audience. Beginning in September 1982, he was a year-long guest at the Wissenschaft-skolleg zu Berlin; the following year he received a fellowship at the New York Institute for the Humanities. Over the four years that followed, Konrád wrote \"A Feast in the Garden\" (Hungarian version 1985). Now released from the official prohibition against publication, he sent the manuscript to the Magvető publishing house in Hungary.\n\nIn 1986 Konrad received an invitation from the Jerusalem Literary Fund, spending a month in that city. This was the period when Konrád primarily penned those essays and diary entries that would be collected for the volume \"The Invisible Voice\" (Hungarian version 1997). Konrád returned to Israel in 1992 and 1996. During his first visit he gave a long biographical interview for the University of Jerusalem, while on the second, he gave a lecture entitled \"Judaism’s Three Paths\" at the Ben Gurion University in Beer Sheva. In 1988 he taught world literature at Colorado College in Colorado Springs.\n\nIn the first years after the fall of the old regime, beginning in 1989, Konrád took an active part in public life in Hungary, and was one of the thinkers who paved the way for the transition to democracy. He was a founding member of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), and one of the founders and spokespeople for the Democratic Charter. He made frequent appearances in both the print and electronic media. In the spring of 1990 Konrád was elected President of PEN International, holding this office for the full term until 1993. He made strenuous efforts on behalf of imprisoned and persecuted writers and called the writers of disintegrating nations together to roundtable conferences in the interest of peace.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2003, Konrád was twice elected President of Berlin’s Akademie der Künste. As the first foreigner to hold that post, Konrád was an effective contributor to the intellectual rapprochement between the East and West of Europe, and did much to introduce writers and other creative figures from Central Europe, and particularly from Hungary, to the West. His efforts were greeted by an appreciative German public. During his presidency, he received the Internationale Karlspreis zu Aachen (2001) and the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2003).\nThough Konrád has frequently portrayed his Berettyóúfalu childhood in his novels, and particularly in \"The Feast in the Garden\", he attempted to present this period in a more precise documentary form in two more recent books, \"Departure and Return\" (2001) and \"Up on the Hill During a Solar Eclipse\" (2003). The first of these books treats a single year – 1944-45 – while the second covers fifty, after beginning with a reflection on the final years of the twentieth century, more precisely the morning solar eclipse of 1999, experienced from the peak of St. György Hill. These books were published separately in Europe, and together in New York as \"A Guest in My Own Country\" (2007).\nThe year 2006 saw the publication of his volume Figures of Wonder, subtitled Portraits and Snapshots. These portraits are modeled primarily on friends, some still living – descriptions that constitute a continuation of the series presented by Konrád in his book \"The Writer and the City\" (2004) together with longer essays. His more recent books, \"The Roosters’ Sorrow\" (2005), \"Pendulum\" (2008), \"The Chimes\" (2009), and \"The Visitor’s Book\" (2013) present his philosophy of life with a near-poetic density.\n\nKonrád has been married three times. In 1955 he married Vera Varsa, with whom he lived until 1963, then married Júlia Lángh, with whom they had two children, Anna Dóra in 1965, and Miklós István in 1967. Since 1979, Konrád lives with Judith Lakner, his third wife, and together they have three children, Áron (1986), József (1987), and Zsuzsanna (1994).\n\nHerder Prize (1983), \nCharles Veillon Prize (1985), \nManes-Sperber Prize (1990), \nKossuth Prize (1990)\nFriedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels (1991), \nGoethe Medal (2000), \nInternationale Karlspreis zu Aachen (2001), \nFranz Werfel Human Rights Award (2007), \nNational Jewish Book Award in the memoir category (2008).\n\nHe has received the highest state distinctions awarded by France, Hungary, and Germany: Officier de l’Ordre national de la Légion d’Honneur (1996); \nThe Hungarian Republic Legion of Honor Middle Cross with Star (2003); \nDas Grosse Verdienstkreuz der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (2003).\nHe holds honorary doctorates from the University of Antwerp (1990) and the University of Novi Sad (2003). He is an honorary citizen of Berettyóújfalu (2003) and of Budapest (2004).\n\nBibliography\n\n\n\n\n"}

Usually, an issue of \"Mad\" features a spoof of at least one feature film or television program. The works selected by the staff of \"Mad\" are typically from the cinema of the United States and the television in the United States, respectively.\n\nThe authors parody the original titles with puns or other wordplay. Characters are caricatured, and lampooned with joke names.\n\nThese articles typically cover five pages or more, and are presented as a sequential storyline with caricatures and word balloons. The opening page or two-page splash usually consists of the cast of the show introducing themselves directly to the reader; in some parodies, the writers sometimes attempt to circumvent this convention by presenting the characters without such direct exposition. This approach was also used for \"Mad\"'s television parodies, and came to be identified with the magazine. The style was widely copied by other humor publications. In 1973, the promotional movie poster for Robert Altman's \"The Long Goodbye\" was designed in the introductory manner of a \"Mad\" parody, including the rectangular word balloons with self-referential dialogue; for verisimilitude, the poster was written and drawn by \"Mad\" regulars Frank Jacobs and Jack Davis.\n\nMany parodies end with the abrupt deus ex machina appearance of outside characters or pop culture figures who are similar in nature to the film or TV series being parodied, or who comment satirically on the theme. For example, Dr. Phil arrives to counsel the \"Desperate Housewives\", or the cast of \"Sex and the City\" show up as the new hookers on \"Deadwood\".\n\nThe parodies frequently make comedic use of the fourth wall, breaking character, and meta-references. Within an ostensibly self-contained storyline, the characters may refer to the technical aspects of filmmaking, the publicity, hype, or box office surrounding their project, their own past roles, any clichés being used, and so on. In 2013, Film Comment wrote, \"While film studies majors gasp over the deconstruction of genre in the works of David Lynch and the meta-movies of Charlie Kaufman, 'the usual gang of idiots' over at MAD have been deconstructing, meta-narrativing, and postmodernizing motion pictures since the very first movie parody (\"Hah! Noon!\") appeared in 1954.\" (However, \"Mad\"'s first movie parody was actually \"Ping Pong\".)\n\nAlmost all of the parodies are of a single, particular film. However, \"Mad\" has occasionally done omnibus parodies of film series, such as the James Bond movies, the 1970s \"Planet of the Apes\" sequels, and the \"Twilight\" movies. It has also combined multiple mini-parodies of unrelated films into a single article. Some actors and directors have said that they regarded ridicule by \"Mad\" as an indication of major success in their careers.\n\nIn recent years, the parodies and their creators have been available outside the pages of the regular magazine. The March/April 2013 issue of \"Film Comment\" (Film Society of the Lincoln Center) carried Grady Hendrix's historical survey of \"Mad\"'s film parodies, titled \"Cahiers du CinéMAD\". In August 2016, four of \"Mad\" 's longtime contributors—editor/artist Sam Viviano, writers Dick DeBartolo and Desmond Devlin, and artist Tom Richmond—appeared at a public symposium in Nebraska to discuss their work in this particular medium. \"Mad\" has also published thematic collections of their past spoofs, from Oscar-winning films to superhero movies to gangster films.\n\nThe following table indicated how many film spoofs in total were made in each decade as well as whom were the most prolific writers and illustrators in each decade.\n\nThe following writers and illustrators, both past and current, are \"Mad's\" most prolific film spoofs writers and illustrators of all time (). \n\n\n"}

These usually stand alone and don't need to be read in a particular order, and the scope of the stories tends to be personal rather than cosmic.\n\nHe loosely modeled the political and economic aspects of the world on the Roman Empire of about the 2nd century AD. Ethshar is the common name of three large cities in the major civilization of this world: Ethshar of the Spices, Ethshar of the Sands, and Ethshar of the Rocks, making up a political entity called the Hegemony of the Three Ethshars. To the southeast of the Hegemony is where the original \"Old Ethshar\" once was. The former Ethshar, which became embroiled in a generations-long war with the Northern Empire, broke up into more than two hundred statelets collectively called the Small Kingdoms before the end of the \"Great War.\". Besides humans, this world has other intelligent races, including dragons. The inhabitants don't have a special name for their world, simply calling it \"The World\" - and this world does not seem to be on a planet, but is rather the end-cap of a cylinder surrounded by what seems to be a noxious yellow gas.\n\nA notable feature of Ethshar - in contrast to some other fantasy worlds - is that there are many distinct different varieties of magic, each with its own laws. Some, like the telekinesis exhibited by Ethshar's warlocks, seem to owe more influence to science fiction than fantasy. Some forms of magic, in particular wizardry, are powerful enough to create other universes.\n\nThe first six Ethshar novels were published by Ballantine's Del Rey imprint, all of them being accepted and nominally edited by Lester Del Rey. The seventh and eighth were published by Tor Books, but disappointing sales led Tor to ask Watt-Evans to concentrate on his non-Ethshar material, which generated much better sales. After writing several non-Ethshar fantasy novels for Tor, Watt-Evans began experimentally serializing the ninth Ethshar novel, \"The Spriggan Mirror\", on his website under a modified form of the Street Performer Protocol. That novel was published in trade paperback, along with the following, \"The Vondish Ambassador.\" LWE has moved on to a third Ethshar serial \"The Final Calling\". The Ethshar short stories were first published in various anthologies; later six of them were included as bonus material in Wildside Press's reprints of the Del Rey Ethshar novels.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Walasian Empire, sorcerers are the aristocracy. They are granted a lot of social power, prestige and wealth, and in return are expected to use their magical abilities for the common good. The system had worked well enough for hundreds of years, and the people in general considered themselves better governed than neighbors with a more conventional aristocracy - but things are starting to change: the economy is in trouble, there is more and more discontent, in the cities people gather and listen to speeches, some of which might be seditious... This is the world into which the protagonist, a young man Anrel Murau, has grown up. His background is a bit unusual. In this society. magical ability is the key to success. While such ability is mostly hereditary, a child of commoners found to have a magical ability is taken into the aristocracy and might attain the highest positions, while a magically-deficient child of magical parents - which is unusual but does sometimes happen - is restricted to more humble positions. Anrel Murau is an example of the latter kind. His wizard parents were killed when a spell they worked went wrong. Deeply traumatized by being so orphaned, he thoroughly detests magic and is happy to be declared a non-magical person and live out his life as a simple clerk. However, when a powerful sorcerer kills Murau's best friend and engages in black magic and human sacrifice, Murau is drawn into a dangerous confrontation, and discovers himself to be an unmatched master in a new kind of magic - that of the orator stirring up the masses. Soon he is caught up in a series of escalating revolutionary events, with increasing popular discontent leading to the title's Fall of the Sorcerers - but a revolution can turn out to be very dangerous also to those who stirred it up. From the outset, it is evident that all this is in fact a fantasy analogue of The French Revolution.\n\n\n\n\nThe Carlisle Hsing books are hard-boiled detective mysteries set in a future interstellar civilization dominated by immensely powerful corporations, with the elites being of clearly East Asian - and specifically, Japanese - origin. Nightside City - hometown of the tough female private detective protagonist - is a city devoted to casinos and gambling, which had been shrouded in perpetual night to the inhabitants' content, but is now doomed as the slow rotation of the planet would within a few decades bring it into the Dayside, into the devastating glare and deadly radiation of the nearby sun, making human life there impossible. For inhabitants of Nightside City, \"Sunrise\" means an impending apocalypse which they must try to escape. But while the city still lives, Carlisle Hsing must earn an uncertain living in a constant fight with crooks, con-men, corrupt business executives and computer programs whose cunning is equal - sometimes superior - to that of humans.\n\n\n\n\nHe has written more than a hundred short stories, including \"Why I Left Harry's All-Night Hamburgers\", which won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1988.\n\n\n\n"}

The book is a study on early times on planetary chains, beginnings of early root races, early civilizations and empires, and past lives of men.\n\nAt the beginning of the book the authors wrote that \"metaphysicians, ancient and modern, declare that Past, Present, and Future are ever simultaneously existent in the divine Consciousness, and are only successive as they come into manifestation, \"i.e.\", under Time which is verily the succession of states of consciousness.\" Hence, when a mystic turn the soul away from earth and focuses his attention upon the spirit – the soul may approach the \"Memory of Nature\", the personification in the material world of the \"Thoughts of the Logos,\" the image, as it were, of \"His Mind.\" There resides the Past in ever-living records.\n\nThe authors say that \"they, having been taught the method of gaining touch, but being subject to the difficulties involved in their uncompleted evolution, have done their best to observe and transmit, but are fully conscious of the many weaknesses which mar their work. Occasional help has been given to them by the Elder Brethren.\"\n\nLeadbeater speculated that \"the total number of souls, or Monads, making up humanity was sixty thousand million, the majority being out of incarnation at any given time.\" Thus reincarnation had been one of the doctrines of the Theosophical Society almost from its beginnings. The principal characters (so-called \"star names\" or pseudonyms) are identified in the following table.\nLeadbeater wrote later that \"the two hundred and fifty characters to whom names have been assigned are supposed to be less than one tenth of the whole\". Professor Joscelyn Godwin said, \"The series of incarnations showed these pioneers going through their own evolution from subhumans to worldly and spiritual leaders of the race.\"\n\nIn the chapter VII the authors describe in detail a remarkable Lemurian:\n\"In Lemuria there was some domestication of animals; the egg-headed Lemurian was seen leading about a scaly monster, almost as unattractive as his master. Animals of all sorts were eaten raw – among some tribes human flesh was not despised – and creatures of the grade of our slugs, snails and worms, much larger than their degenerate descendants, were regarded with peculiar favor as toothsome morsels.\"\n\nIn the chapter IX the authors wrote about Atlantis that \"explosions of gas, floods and earthquakes\" razed Ruta and Daitya, the great islands, left from the cataclysm of 200,000 B.C., and only the island of Poseidonis remained, the last vestige of the once grand continent of the Atlantis. These islands were lost in 75,025 B.C., Poseidonis survived to 9,564 B.C., when it also was devoured by the ocean.\n\nThe authors assert in the chapter X of the book:\n\"The immense growth of wealth and of luxury gradually undermined the most splendid civilization that the world has yet seen. Knowledge was prostituted to individual gain, and control over the powers of nature was turned from service to oppression. Hence Atlantis fell, despite the glory of its achievements and the might of its Empires.\"\n\nBlavatsky wrote in \"The Secret Doctrine\" that the Moon \"plays the largest and most important part, as well in the formation of the Earth itself, as in the peopling thereof with human beings\". The \"Lunar Monads\" or Pitris, the progenitors of man, become in reality man himself. A religious studies scholar Isaac Lubelsky stated that Besant and Leadbeater write in the book the chain of the Moon \"was an evolutionary precursor of the chain of the planet Earth.\"\n\nIn the chapter III the authors describe in detail how Sirius, Alcyone, Herakles and Mizar achieved individualization and left the animal kingdom while living as lunar monkey-creatures. They were servants to a family of lunar men, the leaders of which are now the Masters M. and K.H. Leadbeater wrote that \"individualization from the animal kingdom usually takes place through association with the humanity of the period. Such examples of it as we occasionally see taking place round us at the present time will serve as instances for us.\" Some peculiar domestic animal, well treated by its human friends, is stimulated by its permanent contact with them up to the point where it breaks away from the group-soul to which it has previously belonged. The authors wrote:\n\"One night there is an alarm; the hut is surrounded by savages, supported by their domesticated animals, fierce and strong, resembling furry lizards and crocodiles. The faithful guardians spring up around their master's hut and fight desperately in its defence; Mars comes out and drives back the assailants, using some weapons they do not possess; but, while he drives them backward, a lizard-like creature darts behind him into the hut, and catching up the child Surya begins to carry him away. Sirius springs at him, bearing him down, and throws the child to Alcyone, who carries him back into the hut, while Sirius grapples with the lizard, and, after a desperate struggle, kills it, falling senseless, badly mangled, over its body. Meanwhile, a savage slips behind Mars and stabs at his back, but Herakles, with one leap, flings himself between his master and the weapon and receives the blow full on his breast, and falls, dying. The savages are now flying in all directions, and Mars, feeling the fall of some creature against his back, staggers, and, recovering himself, turns. He recognizes his faithful animal defender, bends over his dying servant, and places his head in his lap. The poor monkey lifts his eyes, full of intense devotion, to his master's face, and the act of service done, with passionate desire to save, calls down a stream of response from the Will aspect of the Monad in a fierce rush of power, and in the very moment of dying the monkey individualizes, and thus he dies – a man.\"\n\nThe theosophical concept of Evolution suppose spiritual development of the Mankind will attain the fullness of the stature of Buddha, Christ, etc. of the prize of the high calling of God in Christianity.\n\nThe authors the book proclaimed \"when the Human Kingdom is traversed, and man stands on the threshold of His superhuman life, a liberated Spirit\", seven paths open before Him for His choosing: He may enter into the blissful omniscience and omnipotence of Nirvana, with activities far beyond our knowing, to become, perchance, in some future world an Avatara, or godlike Incarnation; this is sometimes called, \"taking the Dharmakaya vesture\". He may enter on \"the Spiritual Period\" — a phrase including unknown meanings, among them probably that of \"taking the Sambhogakaya vesture\". He may become part of that treasure-house of spiritual forces on which the Agents of the Logos draw for Their work, \"taking the Nirmanakaya vesture\". He may remain a member of the Occult Hierarchy which rules and guards the world in which He has reached perfection. He may pass on to the next Chain, to aid in constructing its forms. He may enter the majestic Angel – Deva-Evolution. He may give Himself to the immediate service of the Logos, to be used by Him in any part of the Solar System, His Servant and Messenger, who lives but to carry out His will and do His work over the whole of the system which He controls.\n\nA religious studies scholar Alvin Kuhn wrote in his thesis that \"The Canadian Theosophist\", a magazine published at Toronto, announced a series of articles in which \"parallel passages from the writings of Mrs. Blavatsky and the \"Mahatma Letters\" on one side, and from the books of Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbeater, on the other (\"Man: whence, how and whither\" included), gave specific evidence bearing on the claims of perversion of the original theories by those whom they call Neo-Theosophists.\"\n\nJohn Prentice in an article \"Clairvoyant Research\" criticized the book of the authors. He proclaimed that the material for the Peruvian lives in \"Man: whence, how and whither\" (Ch. XI) had been lifted out of Garcilaso de la Vega's \"Royal Commentaries on the Yuccas of Peru\" (written in 1609 and published in English translation in 1638, 1869 and 1871).\n\nJoseph Fussell wrote about \"abnormal and preposterous claims\" published by Besant and Leadbeater.\n\nHelena Roerich stated that Leadbeater's books are a mix of \"false and ugly\" statements and some fragments of truth: one of the Great Masters supposedly called the book \"Man: Whence, How and Whither\" as \"a work which devoid of knowledge, honesty and beauty.\" She wrote: \"The book by Besant and Leadbeater is particularly awful, therein is described the lives supposedly the Great Masters and some their pupils, namely: Besant, Leadbeater... I've never seen anything equal to this tasteless blasphemy and falsehood.\"\n\nProfessor Olav Hammer stated that Leadbeater's claims about past lives \"were increasingly used to buttress power struggles.\" He wrote, \"Those who supported the controversial Leadbeater were recorded as having had important roles in the past, while his opponents were depicted as villains.\"\n\"How can Leadbeater's readers know that his clairvoyant results really are 'records' and 'information', rather than delusions or deliberate fabrications? His response is feeble, 'there is no assurance. The investigators themselves are certain <...> of the difference between observation and imagination'.\"\n\nAlice Bailey stated that the book published at Adyar by Besant and Leadbeater was \"psychic in his implications and impossible of verification\". In her \"Unfinished Autobiography\" she wrote that it proved to her the \"untrustworthiness\" of Leadbeater's writings:\n\"Books were being published at Adyar by Mr. Leadbeater that were psychic in their implications and impossible of verification, carrying a strong note of astralism. One of his major works, \"Man: Whence, How and Whither,\" was a book that proved to me the basic untrustworthiness of what he wrote. It is a book that outlines the future and the work of the Hierarchy of the future, and the curious and arresting thing to me was that the majority of the people slated to hold high office in the Hierarchy and in the future coming civilisation were all Mr. Leadbeater's personal friends. I knew some of these people—worthy, kind, and mediocre, none of them intellectual giants and most of them completely unimportant.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This material differed in major respects from Blavatsky's original presentation, but it is accepted as genuinely Theosophical by many Theosophists around the world. \n\nAfter Blavatsky died in 1891, William Quan Judge became involved in a dispute with Henry Steel Olcott and Annie Besant over Judge allegedly forging letters from the Mahatmas. As a result, he ended his association with Olcott and Besant during 1895 and took most of the Society's American Section with him. He managed his new organization for about a year until his death in New York City, whereupon Katherine Tingley became manager. The organization originating from the faction of Olcott and Besant is based in India and known as the Theosophical Society - Adyar, while the organization managed by Judge is known nowadays simply as the Theosophical Society, but often with the specification, \"international headquarters, Pasadena, California.\" The \"Theosophical Society - Adyar\" is the group denounced as \"Neo-Theosophy\" by those who are followers of William Q. Judge and the original teachings of Madame Blavatsky; they do not accept what they regard as the \"Neo-Theosophical\" teachings of Annie Besant, Henry Olcott, and C. W. Leadbeater. \n\nThe term \"Neo-Theosophy\" was coined by Ferdinand T. Brooks around 1912 in a book called \"Neo Theosophy Exposed\", the second part of an earlier book called \"The Theosophical Society and its Esoteric Bogeydom\". Around 1924, Margaret Thomas published a book called \"Theosophy Versus Neo-Theosophy\". This book, now available online, presents a detailed critical comparison of Blavatskyian Theosophy and Neo-Theosophy.\n\nG. R. S. Mead who was also highly critical of the clairvoyant researches of Besant and Leadbeater, remaining loyal to Blavatskyian Theosophy, also used the term Neo-Theosophy to refer to Besant's movement. For him \"Theosophy\" meant the wisdom element in the great world religions and philosophies.\n\nLater, the term Neo-Theosophical came to be used outside Theosophical circles to refer to groups formed by former Theosophists as well as groups whose central premises borrow heavily from Blavatskyian Theosophy. Robert S. Ellwood, in his 1973 book \"Religious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America\" referred to organizations that had been formed by former Theosophists as \"devolutions of Theosophy\" and included in his survey \"Neo-Gnostic groups and Neo-Rosicrucian groups [...] the Anthroposophy of Rudolf Steiner, [...] Alice Bailey's groups, (Guy Ballard's) \"I AM\" Activity and Max Heindel's Rosicrucianism. In a later book, \"Alternative Altars\" (1979) Professor Ellwood added;\n\nThe author Daryl S. Paulson associates \"neo-Theosophy\" with Alice Bailey.\n\nOther neo-Theosophists include Steiner's contemporary Peter Deunov and Samael Aun Weor, who introduced theosophical teachings to Latin America. Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley were also influencers of (and influenced by) the leading edge of the theosophical movement, which in turn influenced Anton LaVey's Satanism, L. Ron Hubbard's Scientology, Wicca, and the modern New Age and New Thought movements. (Alice Bailey introduced the term \"New Age\"). Some examples of Neo-Theosophists today include Benjamin Creme and Douglas Baker.\n\n"}
{"id": "3079225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3079225", "title": "PM Magazine", "text": "PM Magazine\n\nPM/Evening Magazine is a television series with a news and entertainment format. It was syndicated to stations throughout the United States. In most areas, \"Evening/PM Magazine\" was broadcast from the late 1970s into the late 1980s.\n\nDuring the summer of 1976, KPIX in San Francisco, California, a CBS affiliate then owned by Westinghouse (Group W) Broadcasting, premiered a local weeknight television news and entertainment series titled Evening: The MTWTF Show. The show was designed to add localism as suggested by the newly enacted \"Prime Time Access Rule.\" At its inception, the rule was created by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to give back the half-hour preceding primetime (7:30 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific time zones; 6:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. in the Central and Mountain time zones) to local network-affiliated stations in the top fifty television markets, prohibiting them from accepting network-originated programming (and later on, syndicated reruns of network programs) in that time slot.\n\nKPIX's \"Evening Magazine\" was first hosted by San Francisco radio personality Jan Yanehiro, journalist Steve Fox and Detroit news anchor and reporter Erik Smith. According to the tenth anniversary special, Smith lasted 13 weeks before heading back to Detroit and returning to WXYZ-TV, where he remained until 2010. It was the first of a new breed of television show shot totally on videotape, rather than the then-standard 16mm film, taking advantage of new minicam technology. The format called for the local hosts to have on-location wraparounds (in and around their local communities) and introduce short feature stories about ordinary and interesting people doing extraordinary and quite newsworthy things.\n\nAt the time, Westinghouse owned four other stations around the country, and with the success of \"Evening Magazine\" in the San Francisco market, it was expanded to their other properties. Soon, Group W stations in Baltimore, Maryland (WJZ-TV), Boston, Massachusetts (WBZ-TV), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (KYW-TV), and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (KDKA-TV) were all doing their own local versions of the \"Evening\" format. The show's format allowed the stations to share their feature stories among each other. For example, a feature that aired in San Francisco could also be shown in Baltimore, and vice versa. The success of the format on the Group W stations gave the company management a bigger idea. Group W decided to expand and syndicate the format to other markets where they didn't own stations. The first market that was interested in producing their own \"Evening\", KING-TV in Seattle, Washington, already had a program on the air called \"Evening Magazine\", which airs on that station to this day. However, Group W came up with another title that could be cleared in other markets: PM Magazine.\n\nAt the end of the 1970s, with \"Evening\" and \"PM\" now all over the country, Group W Productions created a large production office in San Francisco at 855 Battery Street. This was on the bottom floor of KPIX-TV. Dick Crew was the National Executive Producer along with the following production staff: Dick Newton, Sally Jewett, Andrew Schorr, Melanie Chilek, Bill Geddie, Diane Heditsian, John Norton, Larry Emsweller, Vanita Cillo, Jim Ziegler, David Baxter, Mellen O'Keefe, Gary Cooper and Joe Tobin. Their function was to watch all of the stories being produced by the new local \"PM\" and \"Evening Magazine\" stations and create a weekly \"national reel\" for stations to run in local markets. Depending on local station budgets they could produce as much or as little feature material as they wanted, but still have a local show starring local talent. The cooperative production model created by \"Evening/PM\" remains unique to this day.\n\n\"Evening/PM\" was also a \"breeding ground\" for television on-air and production talent. Matt Lauer, Tom Bergeron, Nancy Glass, Leeza Gibbons, Henry Tenenbaum and Jerry Penacoli were among those who became well-known because of their work with the \"PM/Evening\" programs. In Pittsburgh, KDKA-TV's broadcast of \"Evening Magazine\" featured a young Dennis Miller providing a \"humorous\" closing piece, similar to Andy Rooney's commentary on \"60 Minutes\". In its more than a decade run, the show's local market producers traveled all over the country and the world, producing fun and memorable television. \"PM Magazine\" was a launching point for the career of actor-meteorologist Mike Randall, who co-hosted the Hartford version from 1982 to 1983.\n\nTwo long features were augmented each day by a block of \"departments\", featuring special tips for daily living—generally, two or three departments were featured in each program, each with a different host. In the early 1980s, \"Captain Carrot\" presented the \"Self\" department, on healthier living; Judi Sheppard Missett presented \"Jazzercise\" in the \"Exercise\" department; Dr. James Wasco presented medical issues in the \"Health\" department; Chef Tell gave new food ideas in the \"Cooking\" department; the \"animal\" department featured Joan Embery and animals from the San Diego Zoo; Fred McBurney hosted \"Outdoor Leisure\" featuring tips related to hunting & fishing; and in the \"Travel\" department, Linda Harris visited various parts of the globe.\n\nOccasionally, \"PM Magazine\" would feature a prime-time \"Special Edition\" special, focusing on a single subject for an entire hour. These specials were hosted not by local hosts, but by more-well-known personalities, such as Bill Rafferty, who hosted a 1980 special edition on \"Mating and Dating in the '80s\"; and a 1982 \"Star-Studded Super Special\" hosted by Robert Guillaume.\n\nThe number of stations carrying \"PM Magazine\" began to decline in the middle- to late-1980s for a variety of reasons.\n\nSome industry insiders have placed a great deal of the blame on Group W Television, which handled both distribution of the franchise as well as national advertising sales for the local editions. The initial arrangements between Westinghouse and stations which subscribed to the \"PM Magazine\" format were done so on a \"barter\" basis, where the local affiliate and the national distributor shared an even split of advertising time and revenue. But by the mid-1980s Group W increased the program's franchise fees, and also took more advertising time within the program, thereby reducing the local affiliates' ability to make money with local spots, some by as much as 20 percent. With fewer local commercial spots to sell, and increasing production costs on the affiliate end, the \"PM Magazine\" format appeared less attractive.\n\nBy 1990, when Group W decided to cancel the format, \"Evening/PM\" had been edged out in many of its local time slots in favor of tabloid TV news–investigation programs, many with little or no local content. Shows such as \"A Current Affair\", \"Hard Copy\", and \"Inside Edition\", along with the lighter-edged \"Entertainment Tonight\" filled up the prime time access available spots and ended \"Evening/PM\"'s run, although KPIX would resurrect its own version of \"Evening Magazine\" once again, this time in the mid-1990s. During this run, one of the hosts was Mike Rowe, who has since moved on to host several cable-TV series, including \"Worst Case Scenarios\" and \"Dirty Jobs\", as well as narrating \"American Chopper\" and \"Deadliest Catch\". KPIX continued to air its version of \"Evening Magazine\" weeknights before CBS's prime time programs up until 2005, when the show's name was changed to \"Eye on the Bay\", and the program's hosts also changed after a short transition.\n\nNotes: This is an incomplete list. Information on local hosts of this program may be found within the individual stations' articles. Stations marked with an asterisk were owned by Group W.\n\n"}

He was born in Pantin, Seine-Saint-Denis. According to himself, he made no significant achievements before the age of 30. From 1967 to 1970, he worked as: life insurance salesman, opinion pool investigator, \"lonely hearts\" columnist, horse racing forecaster, and sales manager for a styrofoam beam company. \n\nFrom 1970 to 1976, he worked for the newspaper \"L'Aurore\". Starting in 1975, he became a \"reporter\" on \"Le petit rapporteur\" (The Little Snitch), a satirical TV show hosted by Jacques Martin . He caught the public's attention with unconventional interviews of celebrities, among them novelists Françoise Sagan or Jean-Edern Hallier.\n\nHe appeared for the first time on stage at the Olympia theater during a Thierry Le Luron show. Among other things, he became very famous for his \"Chroniques de la haine ordinaire\" (Chronicles of Ordinary Hatred), a 1986 radio show. \n\nIn the 1980s, he appeared daily on \"Le tribunal des flagrants délires\" (a pun on the French term \"flagrant délit\" meaning red-handed), a comedy show where celebrities were judged in mock-trials. Desproges held the part of the prosecutor for more than two years, a part for which his verve, his scathing humour and his literary erudition were ideally suited.\n\nIn 1982, he created \"La minute nécessaire de Monsieur Cyclopède\", a series of shorts for TV, where he played an omniscient professor. He answered to metaphysical and nonsensical questions such as \"How to make King Louis XVI fireproof?\", proved that Beethoven was not deaf but stupid, and explained why the improbable encounter between the Venus de Milo and Saint Exupéry's 'Petit Prince' was a fiasco. Each episode ended with the catchphrase: \"Étonnant, non ?\" (\"Astonishing, isn't it?\")\n\nIn 1984, he had his first stand-up show at the Théâtre Fontaine. In 1986, his second stand-up, \"Pierre Desproges se donne en spectacle\" was presented at the Théâtre Grévin. He started work on a third stand-up, and the drafts were ultimately published in 2010.\n\nIn 1987, doctors discovered he had inoperable lung cancer in an advanced stage, and his relatives, in agreement with the doctors, decided to hide the condition from him, so he could spend his final days quietly. He died in 1988, from a disease he had bitterly laughed at time and time again, often saying \"I won't have cancer: I'm against it\". He is buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His epitaph reads: \"Pierre Desproges est mort d'un cancer, étonnant, non ?\" (\"Pierre Desproges died of cancer, astonishing, isn't it?\")\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1499508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1499508", "title": "Pre-Adamite", "text": "Pre-Adamite\n\nThe pre-Adamite hypothesis or pre-adamism is the theological belief that humans (or intelligent yet non-human creatures) existed before the biblical character Adam. Pre-adamism is therefore distinct from the conventional Jewish, Christian or Muslim belief that Adam was the first human. Advocates of this hypothesis are known as \"pre-Adamites\", along with the humans who they believe existed before Adam.\n\nSt. Augustine's \"The City of God\" contains two chapters indicating a debate between Christians and pagans over human origins: Book XII, chapter 10 is titled \"Of the falseness of the history that the world hath continued many thousand years\" and the title of book XVIII, chapter 40 is \"The Egyptians' abominable lyings, to claim their wisdom the age of 100,000 years\". The titles indicate that Augustine saw pagan ideas concerning both the history of the world and the chronology of the human race as incompatible with the Genesis creation narrative. Augustine’s position on this matter was supported by most rabbis and by the church fathers, who generally dismissed views on the antiquity of the world as myths and fables not requiring any considered refutation.\n\nIn early Islam, a common belief held that mankind is actually the successor of other intelligent creatures such as Jinn and Hinn. Medieval Muslim traditions often referred to the Jinn as \"pre-Adamites\", depicted as human-like in various ways. Although the notion of Jinn as pre-adamites was generally accepted, the idea that before the known Adam there lived other humans was a controversial one. From the mid-ninth century onwards the idea appeared, that God created several Adams each of whom presides over an era lasting around 50.000 years. Although these conceptions was regarded as heretic by most Muslims, it was widely accepted by Ismailis and Sufis. \n\nA book titled \"Nabatean Agriculture\", written or translated by Ibn Wahshiyya in 904, collated texts about the activities and beliefs of Arabic groups such as the Nabataeans, in defence of Babylonian culture against Islam. The book discussed the ideas that people lived before Adam, that he had parents, and that he came from India.\n\nThe Jewish poet Yehuda Halevi wrote his Kitab al Khazari between 1130 and 1140, featuring a discussion where the King of the Khazars questioned three theologians (a Jewish rabbi, a Christian, and a Muslim) which was the true religion, and raised the challenge that people in India said they had buildings and antiquities which were millions of years old. The rabbi responded that his faith was unshaken, as the Indians lacked \"a fixed form of religion, or a book concerning which a multitude of people held the same opinion, and in which no historical discrepancy could be found.\" The rabbi dismissed Indians as dissolute, unreliable people, whose claims could be ignored. Later in the book, Halevi rejected the \"Nabatean\" claims as these people did not know of the revelation in Scripture, and he dismissed Greek theories of an eternal world. In his conclusion, Halevi maintained that Adam was the first human in this world but left open other possibilities: \"If, after all, a believer in the Law finds himself compelled to admit an eternal matter and the existence of many worlds prior to this one, this would not impair his belief that this world was created at a certain epoch, and that Adam and Noah were the first human beings.\"\n\nThe claims in \"Nabatean Agriculture\" were also disputed by Maimonides (1135–1204) in \"The Guide for the Perplexed\". He attributed the concepts to the Sabians and said they were just legends and mythology which deviated from monotheism though drawing on Jewish sources, but in refuting the speculations, he circulated an outline of the ideas among other scholars: \"They deem \"Adam\" to have been an individual born of male and female like any other human individuals, but they glorify him and say that he was a prophet, the envoy of the moon, who called people to worship the moon. and there are compilations of his on how to cultivate the soil.\" He noted the claim that Adam came from India, and went on to Babylon.\n\nThe presence of a belief in the existence of men before Adam among the Familists, a religious community in Friesland, was noted by John Rogers in 1578.\n\nIn 1591, Giordano Bruno argued that, because no one could imagine that the Jews and the Ethiopians had the same ancestry, God must have either created separate Adams or that Africans were the descendants of pre-Adamic races.\n\nThe 17th-century French millenarian Isaac La Peyrère, because of his influence on subsequent thinkers and movements, is usually credited with formulating the pre-Adamite theory. In his \"Prae-Adamitae\", published in Latin in 1655, La Peyrère argued that Paul's words in should be interpreted to mean that \"if Adam sinned in a morally meaningful sense there must have been an Adamic law according to which he sinned. If law began with Adam, there must have been a lawless world before Adam, containing people.\" Thus, according to La Peyrère, there must have been two creations; first the creation of the Gentiles and then the creation of Adam, who was the father of the Hebrews. The existence of pre-Adamites, La Peyrère argued, explained Cain's taking of a wife and the building of a city after Abel's murder in the Book of Genesis. This account of human origins became the basis for 19th century theories of polygenism and modern racism.\n\nSome date the origins of the racial theory precisely to 24 April 1684, when François Bernier distinguished four or five races (with no hierarchical distinction between them) in an article titled (\"A new division of the Earth, according to the different species or races of men who inhabit it\") published in the \"Journal des sçavans\". Because of widespread theological opposition to the pre-Adamite theories of his friend La Peyrère, Bernier published his paper anonymously.\n\nDuring the Age of Enlightenment, pre-Adamism was adopted widely as a challenge to the biblical account of human origins. In the 19th century, the idea was welcomed by advocates of white superiority. A number of racist interpretive frameworks involving the early chapters of Genesis arose from pre-Adamism. Some pre-Adamite theorists held the view that Cain left his family for an inferior tribe described variously as \"white Mongols\" or that Cain took a wife from one of the inferior pre-Adamic peoples.\n\nVarious Sufis, especially Sultan Bahu, a famous 17th-century mystic of the Qadiriyya, a Sufi order, advocated this theory. In one of his writings, he wrote, \"Once God said to the Prophet \"O Muhammad I created an Adam before I created your father Adam, whom I gave a life of thousand years. Then I created fifteen thousand Adams all of whom I gave a life of ten thousand years. After that I created your Adam.\"\n\nAccording to that statement, the pre-Adamic era lasted for 150,100,000 years.\n\nIn 19th century Europe, pre-Adamism was attractive to those intent on demonstrating the inferiority of non-Western peoples, and in the United States, it appealed to those attuned to racial theories who found it unattractive to contemplate a common history with non-whites.\n\nScientists such as Charles Caldwell, Josiah C. Nott and Samuel G. Morton rejected the view that non-whites were the descendants of Adam. Morton combined pre-Adamism with cranial measurements. As Michael Barkun explains:\nIn 1860, Isabella Duncan wrote \"Pre-Adamite Man, Or, The Story of Our Old Planet and Its Inhabitants, Told by Scripture & Science\", a mixture of geology and scriptural interpretation. The book was popular among a number of geologists because it mixed biblical events with science. She suggested that the pre-Adamites are today's angels. Since they were without sin, for sin did not enter the world until Adam disobeyed God, there was no reason for them not to have been at least raptured into heaven, anticipating what would again occur with the second coming of Jesus Christ. Duncan also believed that some angels had sinned and fallen from Heaven, which caused them to become demons. Duncan supposed that such an upheaval would leave geological scars on the earth. The concept of ice ages, pioneered by Louis Agassiz, seemed to provide evidence of such events, drawing the line between the pre-Adamic era and the modern one, which she posited began about 6,000 years ago.\n\nFollowing the American Civil War, Southerners were increasingly receptive to arguments that supported their belief in black inferiority. In 1867, Buckner H. Payne, under the pen name Ariel, wrote a pamphlet, \"The Negro: What is His Ethnological Status?\" He argued that the Negro is a pre-Adamic beast of the field (specifically, a higher order of monkey), which was preserved on Noah's Ark. In 1891, William Campbell, under the pen name \"Caucasian\", wrote in \"Anthropology for the People: A Refutation of the Theory of the Adamic Origin of All Races\" that the non-white peoples were not descendants of Adam and therefore \"not brothers in any proper sense of the term, but inferior creations\" and that polygenism was the \"only theory reconcilable with scripture.\"\n\nFollowing Payne, Campbell viewed the Great Flood as a consequence of intermarriage between the white (Adamic) and nonwhite (pre-Adamic) peoples \"the only union we can think of that is reasonable and sufficient to account for the corruption of the world and the consequent judgement.\"\n\nLester A Hoyle wrote a book in 1875, \"The Pre-Adamite, or who tempted Eve?\" He claimed that there had been five distinct creations of races, and only the fifth, the white race, of which Adam was the father, had been made in God’s own image and likeness.\n\nIn an unusual blend of contemporary evolutionary thinking and pre-Adamism, the Vanderbilt University theistic evolutionist and geologist Alexander Winchell argued in his 1878 tract, \"Adamites and Preadamites\", for the pre-Adamic origins of the human race, on the basis that the Negroes were too racially inferior to have developed from the Biblical Adam. Winchell also believed that the laws of evolution operated according to the will of God.\n\nThe Irish lawyer Dominick McCausland, a Biblical literalist and anti-Darwinian polemicist, maintained the theory to uphold the Mosaic timescale. He held that the Chinese were descended from Cain and that the \"Caucasian\" race would eventually exterminate all others. He maintained that only the \"Caucasian\" descendants of Adam were capable of creating civilisation, and he tried to explain away the numerous non-\"Caucasian\" civilisations by attributing them all to a vanished \"Caucasian\" race, the Hamites.\n\nIn 1900, Charles Carroll wrote \"The Negro a Beast; or, In the Image of God\". He concludes in the book that the white race was made in the image and likeness of God and that Adam gave birth to only the white race, and Negros are pre-Adamite beasts, who could not possibly have been made in God's image and likeness because they are beastlike, immoral and ugly. Carroll claimed that the pre-Adamite races, such as blacks, did not have souls. Carroll believed that race mixing was an insult to God and spoiled God's racial plan of creation. According to Carroll, the mixing of races had also led to the errors of atheism and evolution.\n\nThe Scottish millennialist George Dickison wrote \"The Mosaic Account of Creation, As Unfolded in Genesis, Verified by Science\" in 1902. The book mixed science with a scientifically enhanced reading of Genesis and lists geological discoveries that showed that men existed before Adam had been created and that Earth was much older than the 6000-year-old span of the Adamic race. Dickison welcomed scientific discoveries from fossil evidence and the palaontological record and used them as evidence for pre-Adamism.\n\nAllan Kardec, the founder of Spiritualism taught polygenism and that the earth was populated \"from time immemorial\" and that the Adamic race has \"pushed all other races forward\".\n\nThe doctrine known as British Israelism, which developed in England in the 19th century, also sometimes included a pre-Adamic worldview but that was a minority position. The model viewed pre-Adamites as a race of inferior bestial creatures apart from Adam, who was the first white man and consequently the first son of God. In the narrative, Satan seduces Eve, and the resulting offspring is a hybrid creature, Cain. Later, Cain flees to East Turkestan to establish a colony of followers intent on realizing the Devil’s plan for domination of the earth. A further elaboration of this myth involved the identification of the Jews with the Canaanites, the putative descendants of Cain, but the eponymous ancestor of the Canaanites is not Cain but Canaan. It followed that if the tribes of Judah were supposed to have intermarried with Cain’s descendants, the Jews were both the offspring of Satan and the descendents of sundry nonwhite pre-Adamic races.\n\nIn the United States, British Israelism developed into the aggressively anti-Semitic Christian Identity movement in which the Jews were \"mongrelized\" serpent seed.\n\nNon-racist pre-Adamism can be traced back to Paschal Beverly Randolph, an occultist. Paschal was of Malagasy and Native American ancestry and was a spokesman against slavery. Paschal believed in Pre-Adamism and wrote \"Pre-Adamite Man: Demonstrating The Existence of the Human Race Upon the Earth 100,000 Thousand Years Ago!\" under the name Griffin Lee in 1863. The book was a unique contribution towards pre-Adamism because it was not based on only biblical grounds. Randolph used a wide range of sources to write his book from many different world traditions, esoterica and ancient religions. In the book, Paschal claims that Adam was not the first man and that pre-Adamite men existed on all continents around the globe 35,000 to 100,000 years ago. His book is different from many of the other writings by other pre-Adamite authors because Randolph claimed that the pre-Adamites were civilised men, but other pre-Adamite authors argued that the pre-Adamites were beasts or (not fully human) hominids.\n\nPre-Adamite theories have also been held by a number of mainstream Christians such as the Congregational evangelist R. A. Torrey (1856–1928), who believed in the Gap Theory and that pre-Adamites had survived into the present day.\n\nGleason Archer was a believer in pre-Adamism. He wrote in his 1985 book, \"A Survey of Old Testament Introduction\", \"To revert to the problem of the Pithecanthropus, the Swanscombe man, the Neanderthal and all the rest (possibly even the Cro-magnon man, who is apparently to be classed as \"Homo sapiens\", but whose remains seem to date back at least to 20,000 B.C.) it seems best to regard these races as all prior to Adam’s time, and not involved in the Adamic covenant. We must leave the question open, in view of the cultural remains, whether these pre-Adamic creatures had souls (or, to use the trichotomic terminology, spirits).\" \n\nGleason went on to assert that only Adam and his descendants were infused with the breath of God and a spiritual nature corresponding to God himself, and he said that all mankind subsequent to Adam’s time must have been literally descended from him. However, he retains the concept of pre-Adamic races (such as the Cro-Magnon man), and says: \"They may have been exterminated by God for unknown reasons prior to the creation of the original parent of the present human race\".\n\nMore recently, such ideas have been promoted by Kathryn Kuhlman and Derek Prince among Pentecostals, John Stott among Anglicans, and Old Earth creationist Hugh Ross.\n\nImmanuel Velikovsky was a believer in pre-Adamism. He wrote \"In the Beginning\". In the book, Velikovsky describes catastrophes that had occurred before those described in his first book, \"Worlds in Collision\". In the first section, his chapter \"The Pre-Adamite Age\" discusses pre-Adamism. He wrote that the \"talmudic-rabbinical tradition believed that before Adam was created, the world was more than once inhabited and more than once destroyed.\" Moreover, he wrote that according to the evidence from many different traditions, Adam and Eve were not a single human pair and there must have been many of them.\n\n"}

{"id": "35444380", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35444380", "title": "Religion and personality", "text": "Religion and personality\n\nMost scientists agree that religiosity is not an independent personality trait, but something that can have the effect of personality traits. Viewing religiosity through the lenses of differing personality characteristics provides a relatively empirical way to study a difficult concept. Over time, the act of being religious has been a consistent behavior across almost every culture, and thus provides evidence that our personality can help explain the seeming predisposition of religious people.\n\nWith the ability to use modern, empirically tested personality measures, researchers can link results with religiosity. In linking personality measures with religion, it is possible to quantitatively study results, which can provide insight into how and why religion is such an important element of being human. However, more research is needed to definitively say that there is a correlation between certain personality characteristics and religion.\n\nThe five-factor model of personality is currently accepted as a comprehensive model of personality. The five-factor model (FFM) identifies five broad traits underlying the many narrower traits that can be used to describe personality. The identified traits are: 1) extraversion, the quantity and intensity of one's interpersonal interactions 2) neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and hostility 3) conscientiousness, the persistence, organization, and motivation exhibited in goal-directed behaviors 4) agreeableness, the quality of one's interpersonal interactions along a continuum from compassion to antagonism 5) openness, the proactive seeking and appreciation of new experiences. The idea behind the big five personality characteristics that makes them compatible to religious study is that each trait is orthogonal, or completely independent from one another. In having the ability to separate each essential trait from the other, it is possible to study each personality characteristic and how it relates to religiosity.\n\nThe idea of studying the psychology of religion through a personality lens is not a new idea, however. There has been research to both support and refute the ability of personality traits to explain religious or spiritual involvement. Research using Eysenck's model has found that religiosity in general is associated with low openness to experience, as well as low psychoticism, a factor associated inversely with agreeableness and conscientiousness. A review of studies examined the relations between the FFM and measures of religiosity, spiritual maturity, religious fundamentalism, and extrinsic religion. General religiosity was mainly related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness of the big five traits. Additionally, there was a weak positive association with extraversion, and a very small but significant relationship with low openness to experience. This same study also found that the two different concepts of religiosity and spirituality both involve an overall compassionate attitude towards others and positively correlates with agreeableness. Open, mature religiosity and spirituality were associated with high openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and with low neuroticism. Religious fundamentalism was associated with higher agreeableness, and lower neuroticism and lower openness to experience. Because of these factors, it was also seen that more religious people seem to be altruistic and more well behaved. However, this correlation is pretty small. It is not known if religious people tend to be better behaved or if better behaved people are more attracted to religion. Extrinsic religiosity was associated with higher neuroticism but unrelated to the other personality factors. All of these relationships between personality and religion were small. This finding does not necessarily support the concept of personality for being the specific reason for religiosity, however this correlation with the FFM can lead to more in depth research on the topic.\n\nAs previously stated, one of the major strengths for using the FFM to study religiosity in people is the how empirically tested, and accurate the measure actually is in accordance to personality. Another strength is that the big five is an excellent starting point for beginning to look at links between personality and religiosity because it is simply laid out. While this is a huge strength, some research argues that its downfall lies in that it is solely a personality indicator, and is not compatible with religious or spiritual matters. For example, in another study that investigated the correlation between religiosity and the FFM, a conclusion was drawn that religiosity and/or spirituality should be made into a sixth personality factor in order to truly make research using this model accurate. As more advances in research using the FFM to study religiosity and spirituality come, there will be a clearer cut answer as to whether there is a significant place for the FFM in studying religious behavior.\n\nAttachment Theory is another example of a personality indicator with the ability to help researchers understand religiosity and spirituality. The basic premise of attachment theory is that infants form relationships with their caregivers, and depending on the type of attachment, personality and future relationships will be influenced accordingly. The idea behind how the theory relates to the psychology of religion is that these future relationships can be with the particular god, or higher power.\n\nIn attachment theory, there have been three attachment styles identified: 1)secure style- confidence in the availability of attachment figures during times of need 2)avoidant style- insecurity and lack of trust in the ability of others to care for one's needs 3) anxious-ambivalent style- view of others as being reluctant to get close to oneself. The research varies in explaining which type of attachment style yields the individual's particular relationship with God. For example, in one study, a secure relationship with one's parents will translate into a secure attachment to God, and vice versa. However, other research has showed that there is a compensatory effect, or the need of people to make up for something that is lacking. For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style with their parents may in turn, have a very secure, and confident relationship with God.\n\nThe idea of being able to link people's religiousness (or lack thereof) with how their attachment with their caregivers was, seems to be a promising field of study. The obstacle that makes this seemingly simple idea very complicated is that the current data is so skewed. There are many studies that found there is a direct correspondence from attachment style with caregivers to God, and there are studies who have found more compensatory results. The inability of researchers to find a general consensus could be a hindrance towards future exploration in this field.\n\nObject relations theory's roots lie in children relating or associating different emotions with different people (objects). The children associate these emotions to the objects based on how they currently view the world around them. For example, kids will associate the emotion of something good with mother, and bad with something like criminals. In relating this with religious ideals, it seems natural that the same concept should apply. One's relationship with God should, in theory, be traced back to association.\n\nIn this theory, it is hypothesized that the person ends up creating an idea of God according to what the individual needs, and how he or she perceives the world. This view of personality and religion does not focus on how each person differs trait wise, but it centers on the type of relationship the individual has with God.\n\nAn important notion to keep in mind with Object Relations theory is that it is highly theoretical. This is a weakness in the sense that all data is based on a concept that cannot be objectively verified, and thus creates a confound. As with all inquiries about the psychological nature of religion, it is difficult to find extremely valid and reliable measures because of the introspective nature of the subject. That being said, there is something that we can learn from this field of study. By analyzing how this theory of personality development correlates with one's attachment to a religious deity, we can hopefully begin to understand how important association, and perception is to religious ideals.\n\nResearch has shown that struggles with religion correlates to basic personality traits. Studies on The Big Five Factors of Personality, as well as factors such as self-compassion, self-esteem, and entitlement, suggest that there is a significant relationship between religious uncertainty and personality.\n\nPeople who are high in neuroticism may have a hard time trying to find purpose in their life. This correlates with divine struggles as they may encounter distress when it comes to finding the meaning of life as well as recognizing divine figures of religions. Extroversion, however, has not been linked through research or studies with religious struggles. Very little evidence is available to suggest that openness to experience is linked to religious struggles, but it is thought that those who are high in openness to experience may carry more doubt in religion compared to those who are lower in openness to experience. Both agreeableness and conscientiousness have been associated with possible animosity towards God or other divine figures. It has also been found that religious people are more likely to avoid risk.\n\nResearch done by Salsman, Brown, Brechting, and Carlson showed a positive correlation between religion and life satisfaction of about 0.2 to 0.3. It was shown by Salsman that those who practice religion have a generally more positive outlook on life. Many elements of religion have been studied to determine which aspects impacts one's life satisfaction. It was found that both personal and organizational religion can lead to an increased life satisfaction. Individual prayer, a feeling of intimacy with the divine, and meditation were all linked to greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. When it came to organizational religion, people felt a greater satisfaction knowing that they belonged to a group, had a support system from the church, and felt fulfilled when they increased their participation within the church's community.\n\nThose who feel conflicted about religion may encounter a decline in their health, both mentally and physically. Research has shown that those who have religious struggles could have higher depression and anxiety levels. The risk of suicide is even elevated when struggle is present within religion. These struggles have been linked to a separation from the church or the divine; however the cause for the separation is unknown and may stem from different events throughout life such as a traumatic death in the family, difficult life events, or a mental battle between oneself. More research is needed to validate the causes of religious separation and how it effect one's personality.\n\nThe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, or MBTI, uses four dichotomies to indicate a person's psychological preference. When used in studies alongside religion, it has been shown that introverted types (primarily ISTJ and INTJ) are more likely to be atheist. However, a large portion of Greek Orthodox is ISTJ as well. In addition, the \"judging\" (J) type is common among evangelical and Protestants. ESFJ and ENFJ personality types are more interested in becoming ministers than other type. ENFJs are more attracted to becoming ministers of liberal denominations, while ESFJs are more interested in becoming ministers in conservative denominations. It should also be noted that the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator, although popular, is flawed.\n\nMost religions are based around a belief in some sort of supernatural being. This may lead some to believe that the characteristic of being religious would relate in someway to the characteristic of believing in other paranormal beings. However, multiple studies have found no correlation between these two characteristics. This could be due to the fact that many religions discourage their members from thinking too much of paranormal beings, as they are thought to be evil. In conclusion, paranormal beliefs are probably not highly related to personality traits.\n\nWhile there are many who believe religion has a strong influence on personality development, some believe it may be a personality trait on its own. Vassilis Saroglou, for example, has developed on the idea by introducing four traits of personality that religion develop: believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging. Believing refers to someone accepting the belief in a supernatural being or world. Bonding is how important religion is to the self and how it connects them to something larger than themselves. Behaving is how someone changes their own lifestyle to appease their spiritual beliefs. Belonging is the identity one acquires from believing in a religion. This concept, published in 2011, easily applies to religion cross-culturally and to a wide range of spirituality.\n\n"}

The sculptures are on topics mostly concerning Scottish literature and poetry, and are made out of old books by an anonymous female paper sculptor.\n\nThe initial group of book sculptures was a group of ten elaborate sculptures that were left around various cultural locations in Edinburgh, Scotland, between March and November 2011, as gifts to the cultural institutions and people of the city. The identity of the artist is unknown, although notes with some of the sculptures referred to the artist as 'she'. The sculptures were made from old books and were accompanied by gift labels which praised literacy and the love of words, and argued against library and other arts funding cuts. An eleventh sculpture was presented to author Ian Rankin, whose works featured prominently in many of the other sculptures. The ten Edinburgh sculptures were toured through Scotland in an exhibition in late 2012.\n\nThe sculptor was then commissioned to produce five more book sculptures to be hidden in secret locations around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, which commenced in November 2012. Despite the commission, the artist has maintained her anonymity.\n\nThe sculptor also made another gift sculpture in December 2012, which she anonymously presented to the Scottish Poetry Library, already the previous recipient of two of her earlier works.\n\nIn May 2013 a new sculpture, featuring three eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdbox, was left in the Scottish Poetry library; this was followed by three baby birds in a nest, left at Leith Library. \nIn 2014 a flutter or swarm of butterflies from an open book sculpture was left in aid of the Macmillan charity. This sculpture was bought privately but is intending to tour for a not-for-profit basis in 2015.\n\nThese are listed in the order of their discovery. In the first ten cases, the person who deposited the sculptures was not noticed, and some of the sculptures were found several days after they had been put in place. The eleventh was a gift to author Ian Rankin.\n\nThe first sculpture was found on Tuesday 2 March 2011 on a table in the Scottish Poetry Library. It comprised a tree with intricately fashioned branches and leaves, standing on a thick leather-bound old book. At the base of the tree was a paper egg, broken in half and with the inside lined with gold, in which were a scatter of individual words, which could be put together to make \"A Trace of Wings\", a poem by Edwin Morgan. It was accompanied by a tag, addressed to @byleaveswelive, the name of the Library's Twitter account. \"By leaves we live\" is a Patrick Geddes quote about the idea that you reap what you sow.\n\nThe note on the tag read: \"It started with your name @byleaveswelive and became a tree.… … We know that a library is so much more than a building full of books… a book is so much more than pages full of words.… This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. a gesture (poetic maybe?)\".\n\nThe sculpture was nicknamed the \"poetree\" by the staff at the Library, and despite national publicity, the identity of its maker remained unknown.\n\nThe second sculpture was found in late June 2011 at the National Library of Scotland, a \"delicately crafted\" gramophone and a coffin fashioned from a copy of Edinburgh-based author Ian Rankin's book \"Exit Music\".\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \"For @natlibscot – A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. (& against their exit)\".\n\nLater on in June 2011 a third sculpture was anonymously deposited, this time at the box office of the Edinburgh Filmhouse. This one comprised \"a complex scene in a paper cinema; punters arrayed on seats watching men and horses coming alive from the screen and charging outwards.\" One of the audience had Ian Rankin's face, and was holding a bottle of Deuchars IPA.\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \"For @filmhouse – A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. and all things *magic*\". A quote from Francis Ford Coppola, \"I think cinema, movies, and magic have always been closely associated\" was pasted onto the sculpture.\n\nThe fourth sculpture was found on a windowsill at the Scottish Storytelling Centre. As it lay in a part of the building that does not have much footfall, it may have lain undiscovered at the location for a while, and so its place in the gift chain is uncertain. It comprises a dragon hatching from an egg on a nest of feathers. It is made from a copy of Ian Rankin's book, \"Knots and Crosses\".\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \"For @scotstorycentre – A gift in support of libraries, books, works, ideas….. Once upon a time there was a book and in the book was a nest and in the nest was an egg and in the egg was a dragon and in the dragon was a story…..\"\n\nThe fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. The fifth sculpture was left on one of the signing tables in the festival bookshop. It comprised a tea tray bearing a cup of tea on a cake stand, a cupcake, a used teabag and a (real) old book. The teabag was filled with cut out letters, on the tag of which were the words \"by leaves we live\" (the Twitter name of the Scottish Poetry Library account referenced in the first sculpture). On the top of the tea in the teacup was a spiral swirl of words which read \"Nothing beats a nice cup of tea (or coffee) and a really good BOOK\", and on the tray next to the cupcake: \"except maybe a cake as well\".\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \"To @edbookfest 'A gift' This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…… & festivals xx\".\n\nThe fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. The sixth sculpture was secreted about the Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature information stand in the entrance tent. It shows a man sitting under a tree. It is made from an Everyman's Library edition of \"The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner\" by James Hogg.\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \"To @edincityoflit 'A gift' LOST (albeit in a good book) This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…. “No infant has the power of deciding….. by what circumstances (they) shall be surrounded.. Robert Owen\".\n\nThe seventh sculpture was found on 30 August 2011 on a bookshelf at Edinburgh Central Lending Library. It comprises a magnifying glass on a stand on top of a (real) old book. Some words on the book are also shown in the lens of the magnifying glass: \"When I go in I want it bright, I want to catch whatever is there in full sight\".\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \"For Central Library 'A Gift' @Edinburgh_CC This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…. Libraries are expansive\". The word 'expensive' has had the E crossed out and replaced with an A. The tag also notes, \"Words on book – Edwin Morgan\".\n\nThe eighth sculpture was found on 23 November 2011 in the Scottish Poetry Library, where the first sculpture was found in March 2011. The staff were first alerted to its presence by a note which the sculptor had left in the guest book: \"Hopefully next time I’ll be able to linger longer – I’ve left a little something for you near Women’s Anthologies X. In support of Libraries, Books, Words and Ideas….\" The sculpture was found on a bookshelf. The sculpture comprised two parts: an elaborate cap made of a wing of finely cut paper feathers, and a pair of gloves with 'bumblebee' stripes.\n\nThe note accompanying the sculptures was written on both sides. It described the inspiration for the sculptures, a quote from the poem \"Gifts\" by Scottish poet Norman MacCaig: \"To @ByLeavesWeLive... The gifts 'Gloves of bee's fur, cap of the Wren's Wings...' Norman McCaig ... maybe sometimes impossible things... In support of Libraries, Books, Words Ideas...\" and \"10/10\".\n\nA longer note accompanying the piece made clear that this sculpture was the last in a series of ten sculptures:\n\n\"It's important that a story is not too long ……does not become tedious ……. 'You need to know when to end a story,' she thought. Often a good story ends where it begins. This would mean a return to the Poetry Library. The very place where she had left the first of the ten. Back to those who had loved that little tree, and so encouraged her to try again …….and again. Some had wondered who it was, leaving these small strange objects. Some even thought it was a ‘he’! ……. As if! Others looked among Book Artists, rather good ones actually……. But they would never find her there. For though she does make things, this was the first time she had dissected books and had used them simply because they seemed fitting…. Most however chose not to know….. which was the point really. The gift, the place to sit, to look, to wonder, to dream….. of the impossible maybe……. \nA tiny gesture in support of the special places…. So, here, she will end this story, in a special place … A Poetry Library …. where they are well used to 'anon.' But before exiting …a few mentions. There could be more, because we have all colluded to make this work……. Just a few though. \n…… But hold on. Someone’s left behind a pair of gloves and a cap……….?\nCheers Edinburgh It’s been fun! X\"\n\nThe revelation that this was the tenth sculpture caused some concern, as only eight were known of at this point. It was feared that the other two might have been lost or stolen or even simply thrown away by someone who didn’t realise what they had found.\n\nThe ninth sculpture was found on 24 November 2011 at the National Museum of Scotland, where it had been placed on the plinth under a stag skeleton. It comprised a tyrannosaurus rex bursting out of a copy of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\". Small human figures with weapons were amongst the shredded leaves of the book.\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \"For @NtlMuseumsScot A Gift Your friends at @edbookfest suggested you might like this. …. In support of libraries, books, words, ideas and those places that house our treasures……\". and \"9/10\".\n\nThis sculpture was the eighth in the gift chain, but was the last to be found, on 24 November 2011. It was found at the Writers' Museum in Edinburgh, on top of the donations box in the Robert Louis Stevenson room. It comprises a moonlit street scene, and is fashioned from a copy of Ian Rankin's second Rebus novel, \"Hide and Seek\". It bore the words \"commingled out of Good and evil\", which is a quote from Stevenson's \"Jekyll and Hyde\".\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \"@CuratorEMG A Gift 'The stories are in the stones' Ian Rankin In support of Libraries, Books, Words, Ideas …… and Writers.\" and \"8/10\".\n\nAlthough the artists had said that the series comprised ten sculptures, on 25 November 2011 an eleventh was delivered to the Edinburgh Bookshop, an independent booksellers, addressed to Ian Rankin.\n\nThe sculpture comprises two skeletons sitting on a coffin lid; the open coffin is cut out of a (real) old book. The skeletons are drinking and smoking, and listening to a record on a portable record player. The record sleeve reads \"The Impossible Dead/Ian Rankin/Some Secrets Never Die\" and the coffin lid reads \"R.I.P. 13/10/11\". 13 October 2011 was the publishing date of Rankin's novel \"The Impossible Dead\".\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \"For @Beathhigh A Gift \"… something in us never dies\" (R. Burns 1790) In support of those who turn ideas into words, words into books …… & of course books into libraries.\" and \"11/10\".\n\n@Beathhigh is Ian Rankin's Twitter account name.\n\nThe sculptures, and the mystery over the identity of their creator, made local, then national and international news. As of December 2012, the identity of the creator has still not been revealed.\n\nThe ten Edinburgh sculptures were brought together in December 2011 for a one night private exhibition at the Scottish Parliament.\n\nThe Edinburgh sculptures were sent on a small 'mini tour' of Scotland between 17 August and 8 December 2012, appearing at Aberdeen Central Library, Dundee Central Library, Wigtown Book Festival, Mitchell Library, Glasgow, Dunfermline Carnegie Library and the Scottish Poetry Library. In the book \"giftED\" that was published in time for the tour, the sculptor wrote that at the heart of the project was \"a woman, who had been a girl, whose life would have been less rich had she been unable to wander freely into libraries, art galleries and museums. A woman who, now all grown, still wants access to these places and yes, wants them for her children...\". The photographs in the book are by Chris Scott.\n\nIn July 2012 it was reported that a documentary about the sculptures, featuring Ian Rankin and Rory Bremner, is being made.\n\nAfter the tour concluded the original ten sculptures were sent back to their original locations with the bespoke plinths made for the exhibition with the intention that they continue to be accessible to the public.\n\nIn August 2012 the sculptor left fifty paper flower sculptures around the site of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, each with the Oscar Wilde quote \"… freedom, books, flowers and the moon\" and on the reverse \"A Gift For You\" and a limited edition number of /50.\n\nIn November 2012 it was announced that the sculptor had been approached via an anonymous email account and had agreed to make five more sculptures that were to be hidden around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, and that the finders would be given another small sculpture as a prize. Online clues to their whereabouts were released, one a day between 26 and 30 November 2012. Each sculpture was found on the day the clue was released; the person to reach it first each day received a paper sculpture trophy in the shape of a teacup, themed on the book and reading \"A winning cop and a good book - the perfect combination\" on the top.\n\nThe first was found on 26 November 2012 at Glasgow School of Art. It is a book sculpture inspired by Alasdair Gray's classic novel \"\". The finder's prize was a sculpture of a small teacup with elements of the \"Lanark\" theme. The \"Lanark\" sculpture is now displayed next to the Glasgow School of Art shop during opening hours.\n\nThe second sculpture was found at the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum in Alloway, and the sculpture was based on the Robert Burns poem \"Tam O' Shanter\" - which is set in Alloway. The finder's prize was a teacup featuring a horse's tail, a reference to the poem. The sculpture is on display at the Museum.\n\nThe third sculpture was found at the \"Am Politician\" pub on the Isle of Eriskay, where the nine pupils of the Eriskay Primary School found the sculpture based on the Compton Mackenzie novel \"Whisky Galore\". The finder's prize was a teacup with a bottle labelled 'whisky galore' on the top. The sculpture is on display at the pub.\n\nThe fourth sculpture was found at J M Barrie's birthplace in Kirriemuir, and was based on \"Peter Pan\". The finder's prize was a teacup with a hook-tipped spout.\n\nThe fifth sculpture was found at the Scottish Seabird Centre, North Berwick, and was based on Robert Louis Stevenson’s \"Treasure Island\". The finder's prize was a teacup with a palm tree on the top.\n\nIn November 2012 a third sculpture was given to the Scottish Poetry Library, with the instructions that the box in which it was held was not to be opened until 7 December 2012 - the last day of the exhibition of the original ten. Built upon a copy of Robert Louis Stevenson's poetry collection A Child's Garden of Verses it featured a girl sitting under a tree, wearing a crown and reading a book, while the facing page shows Stevenson's poem, \"To My Mother\".\n\nIn the tree are the words, \"You in a garden green\" and \"With me were king and\"; on the girl's crown is the word \"Queen\". On the trunk of the tree are the words, \"Were hunter, soldier, tar\" and the inside of the small book reads, \"And all the thousand things that children are\". Some bunting dangling from the tree read \"But time, which none can bind, While flowing fast away, leaves love behind.\" These are all lines from Stevenson's poem, \"To Willie And Henrietta\".\n\nThe note accompanying the sculpture read: \" ... For the Love of Books. Every ending marks a new beginning.\"\n\nIn May 2013 a new sculpture was left in the Scottish Poetry library. This comprises three blue paper eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdhouse; the nest is on a platform with threads that allow it to be lifted out - the instructions that came with it say, \"Nest can sit at bottom, hang midway or be outside birdbox - it's yours now!\" The box has images and text on either side with gold leaf in places.\nThe eggs are threaded together with slips of paper which read, \"Preparing to start\", \"Sleeping in the woods\" and \"Life's little things\"; the eggs have the words, \"nest-egg\", \"new moon\" and \"great ovation\" stuck to them. The tag reads simply, \"Preparing to Fly 1/3 In support of libraries, words, book, ideas ... x\".\n\nIn June 2013 Leith Library received a sculpture of three baby birds in a nest, addressed both to the library itself (@leithlibrary) and to their Reader in Residence Emily Dodd (@auntyemily), only the second time one of the sculptures has been addressed to a person. Included with the book sculpture was a quote from A.A.Milne \"It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like 'what about lunch?'. In support of libraries, books, words, ideas. Preparing to Fly 2/3\".\n\nAs part of the Macmillan Art Exhibition called 'Inspired' held in Bonhams, Edinburgh, an intricate work of butterflies emerging from a book was delivered, anonymously. This book sculpture was auctioned to raise funds for this charity. It was bought by the Mackenzie family of Edinburgh, who decided to tour this 'Butterflies' sculpture on a not-for-profit basis so that a wider audience could see it. The idea was that the generosity of the artist and the story should continue to inspire others, especially youngsters and those that had not yet been able to experience the 'book sculpture library tour' in Edinburgh. The Butterflies sculpture visited the following locations: The War Poets library, Edinburgh Napier University; BBC Scotland, Pacific Quay; Killin library, Killin; John Gray Library, East Lothian; Kirkwall library, Orkney; Glasgow Museum's Resource Centre, South Nitshill, Glasgow; Abbotsford House, Borders; Crighton Library, Dumfries; Aberdeen Central Library, Aberdeen. The sculpture's tour finished in the Scottish Parliament and was commented upon by MSPs and the First Minister. A 'time for reflection' parliamentary speech was given by Dr Colin Mackenzie, thanking the artist for her generosity and inspiration. \n\nDuring the tour the artist offered to collaborate with members of the public who sent in their own paper butterflies.\n\nIn January 2015 the artist gave an email interview to the BBC, in which she hinted that more sculptures were to come: \"What makes you think 'Butterflies' is my most recent sculpture?\".\n\nIn March 2015 the artist announced that the time had come \"to draw time on the project\". The last sculpture would be a collaboration with the public. A request was made for the public to make their own butterflies before 31 July 2015. These butterflies would be made into a final sculpture.\n\nThe final paper sculpture was a collaboration with the general public in response to the Butterfly On The Move Tour. Butterflies flew in from all over the world and from all different age groups of contributors. The resulting sculpture was a 6'6' high tree with butterflies as 'leaves'. The tree was supported by a 'lost child'. The sculpture appeared at the Edinburgh Book Festival in August, 2016. A hand illustrated book was left with the sculpture. It tells the fictional story of the Butterfly Tree and how it reached out and comforted the Lost Child.\nThe artist intends to remain unknown.\n\n"}
{"id": "7220412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7220412", "title": "Seuso Treasure", "text": "Seuso Treasure\n\nThe Seuso Treasure or Sevso Treasure (; ), is a hoard of silver objects (14 items) from the late Roman Empire. The first pieces appeared on the market in London in 1980, and the treasure was acquired by a consortium headed by Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton. Documentation was provided in which it was stated that it had been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of Lebanon. It was put up for sale in New York City in 1990 by Sotheby's, but was halted when the documentation was found to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia and Lebanon made claims of ownership. The claims of ownership by these countries were rejected by a US court, and the treasure remained in the possession of the Marquess of Northampton. Scotland Yard still has an open case on the matter.\n\nThe origin and provenance of the treasure are likely known, but not publicly acknowledged. There is much scientific evidence to indicate that the hoard was first acquired in the 1970s after the murder of a Hungarian soldier, who discovered the treasure during illicit digging at an established archaeological site in Hungary. On 26 March 2014 Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been bought by Hungary. The Prime Minister described it as \"Hungary's family silverware\". In June 2017 the remaining seven artifacts also got back to Hungary, for a sum of €28 million.\n\nThe treasure trove consists of 14 large decorated silver vessels and the copper cauldron which contained them, and has been dated to the late 4th or early 5th century AD. Most notable is a large dish, 70 cm in diameter and weighing nearly 9 kg, which bears the inscription:\n\nThe hoard first came to attention in 1980, when a single piece in the possession of two antiquities' dealers from Vienna was offered for sale in London. Further pieces reached the market, and what is believed to be the complete hoard was acquired by a consortium headed by Spencer Compton, 7th Marquess of Northampton. Documentation supplied by the Lebanese embassy in Switzerland stated that the treasure had originally been found in the Tyre and Sidon regions of Lebanon, and on that basis the consortium negotiated to sell the collection to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles for $10 million. When that deal fell through, the treasure was put up for sale in New York in 1990 by Sotheby's, described as being from \"what was once the province of Phoenicia in the Eastern Roman Empire\".\n\nThe sale was halted when documentation was thought to be false, and the governments of Hungary, Yugoslavia and Lebanon each made claims of ownership. Hungarian authorities claim that the treasure was discovered by a young soldier, József Sümegh, in around 1975–76 near the town of Polgárdi in central Hungary. Sümegh's dead body was found in a nearby cellar in 1980. The official investigation at the time determined that he had committed suicide, but later the police came to the conclusion that he had been killed. As of 2012 the criminal investigation is still ongoing.\n\nYugoslavia's case was based on claims that the treasure had been originally found on 30 June 1960, in the village of Barbariga in Istria (present-day Croatia). The village is some 20 kilometres north of the city of Pula, an important city in Roman times. According to local witnesses, the treasure had been discovered in old trenches in a nearby Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) compound. In the 1980s the JNA gave permission to local archeologists, led by Vesna Girardi-Jurkić, to further excavate the site. According to unconfirmed eyewitness reports of army excavations, the 14 known artefacts were only a small part of a much larger treasure trove as it took soldiers and police brought to the site six days to list all the items found at the site. However, very few details of the project were ever released to the public as the alleged site was entirely within a military area closed off to civilians. Yugoslav archaeologists' efforts eventually failed to provide any conclusive evidence for the treasure's origin, although the soil residue found on the artefacts was proved to match the samples of soil from the area. After the breakup of Yugoslavia the newly independent Croatia pressed on with the case and included the results of the soil analysis in its formal ownership claim to a New York court.\nIn November 1993, the New York Court of Appeals rejected the claims, and found no case for removing it from the possession of the Marquess of Northampton 1987 Settlement (a trust established by the Marquess of Northampton). The silver was locked away in a bank vault while further legal proceedings followed. The Marquess sued his solicitors Allen & Overy for damages in relation to advice given during the purchase of the silver, and that case was settled out of court in 1999 for a reported £15 million. On 25 June 1999, in written answers to questions in the House of Lords, the British government confirmed that it had no further interest in the case and confirmed the decision not to prosecute.\n\nThe Hungarian claim of possession is likely justified by the fact that on one of the main plates, the \"Hunting Plate\", an inscription is to be seen. It reads \"Pelso\", the Roman name for Lake Balaton in Hungary; the lake is just west of the alleged place of discovery. Also near to the lake, in 1873 a Roman tripod (later restored, upon which it was discovered that it is a quadripod) was discovered; according to scholars, this object featured similar decoration as the Seuso Treasure items, and is very likely a creation of the same hands. It is housed in the Hungarian National Museum in Budapest.\n\nIn September 2006, London auctioneer Bonhams announced that it would exhibit the treasure privately, in a move seen as a prelude to a sale by private treaty or by auction at a future date. A spokesman for the Ministry of Education and Culture of Hungary, which still claims it, said it had informed British authorities that it must not be sold. On 12 October 2006, further written answers were given in the House of Lords to questions by Colin Renfrew, Baron Renfrew of Kaimsthorn, particularly relating to Hungary's possible revised claim to the treasure since its admission to the European Union in 2004. Bonhams went ahead with its private exhibition on 17 October 2006.\n\nIn March 2007, \"The Art Newspaper\" reported that a further \"187 silvergilt spoons, 37 silvergilt drinking cups, and 5 silver bowls\", previously unknown, but part of the original hoard, were reputed to exist. Research presented in February 2008 by the Hungarian archaeologist Zsolt Visy strengthened the view that the origin of the treasure may be the Lake Balaton region of Hungary.\n\nThe Channel 4 archaeology programme \"Time Team\" aired a special on the treasure in December 2008. The programme presented Hungary's evidence for the likely origin of the hoard being near the town of Polgárdi. The Marquess of Northampton withdrew from planned participation in the programme and Channel 4 was not given permission to film the treasure, held in a vault at Bonhams auctioneers in London.\n\nOn 26 March 2014, Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, announced that half of the Seuso Treasure (seven items) had been returned to Hungary, for a sum of €15 million. The seven artifacts were put on temporary display at the Hungarian Parliament Building on 29 March 2014. On 12 July 2017, the Hungarian PM announced that another seven pieces had been brought back to Hungary, and will be displayed together with the seven items returned to Hungary in 2014. The items will be moved to the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts by 2018, where they are intended to be a centrepiece of the new museum's quarter.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is oil on canvas, , and is on display at the Louvre, in Paris, France.\n\nPortrayals of scientists were a favourite topic in 17th-century Dutch painting and Vermeer's oeuvre includes both this astronomer and the slightly later \"The Geographer\". Both are believed to portray the same man, possibly Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. A 2017 study indicated that the canvas for the two works came from the same bolt of material, confirming their close relationship.\n\nThe astronomer's profession is shown by the celestial globe (version by Jodocus Hondius) and the book on the table, the 1621 edition of Adriaan Metius's \"Institutiones Astronomicae Geographicae\". Symbolically, the volume is open to Book III, a section advising the astronomer to seek \"inspiration from God\" and the painting on the wall shows the Finding of Moses—Moses may represent knowledge and science (\"learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians\").\n\nThe provenance of \"The Astronomer\" can be traced back to 27 April 1713, when it was sold at the Rotterdam sale of an unknown collector (possibly or his father, of Rotterdam) together with \"The Geographer\". The presumed buyer was Hendrik Sorgh, whose estate sale held in Amsterdam on 28 March 1720 included both \"The Astronomer\" and \"The Geographer\", which were described as ‘Een Astrologist: door Vermeer van Delft, extra puyk’ (An Astrologist by Vermeer of Delft, topnotch) and ‘Een weerga, van ditto, niet minder’ (Similar by ditto, no less).\n\nBetween 1881 and 1888 it was sold by the Paris art dealer Léon Gauchez to the banker and art collector Alphonse James de Rothschild, after whose death it was inherited by his son, Édouard Alphonse James de Rothschild. In 1940 it was seized from his hotel in Paris by the Nazi \"Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzten Gebiete\" after the German invasion of France. A small swastika was stamped on the back in black ink. The painting was returned to the Rothschilds after the war, and was acquired by the French state as giving in payment of inheritance taxes in 1983 and then exhibited at the Louvre since 1983.\n\nInstitutiones Astronomicae Geographicae by Adriaan Metius\n"}

It is classified as type 402, the animal bride, in the Aarne–Thompson index. Another tale of this type is \"Doll i' the Grass\".\n\nRussian variants include the \"Frog Princess\" or \"Tsarevna Frog\" (\"Царевна Лягушка\", \"Tsarevna Lyagushka\") and also Vasilisa the Wise (\"Василиса Премудрая\", \"Vasilisa Premudraya\"); Alexander Afanasyev collected variants in his \"Narodnye russkie skazki\". Andrew Lang included an Italian variant titled The Frog in \"The Violet Fairy Book\". Italo Calvino included another Italian variant from Piedmont, The Prince Who Married a Frog, in \"Italian Folktales\", where he noted that the tale was common throughout Europe. Georgios A. Megas included a Greek variant, The Enchanted Lake, in \"Folktales of Greece\".\n\nThe king (or an old peasant woman, in Lang's version) wants his three sons to marry. To accomplish this, he creates a test to help them find brides. The king tells each prince to shoot an arrow. According to the King's rules, each prince will find his bride where the arrow lands. The youngest son's arrow is picked up by a frog. The king assigns his three prospective daughters-in-law various tasks, such as spinning cloth and baking bread. In every task, the frog far outperforms the two other lazy brides-to-be. In some versions, the frog uses magic to accomplish the tasks, and though the other brides attempt to emulate the frog, they cannot perform the magic. Still, the young prince is ashamed of his frog bride until she is magically transformed into a human princess.\n\nIn Calvino's version, the princes use slings rather than bows and arrows. In the Greek version, the princes set out to find their brides one by one; the older two are already married by the time the youngest prince starts his quest. Another variation involves the sons chopping down trees and heading in the direction pointed by them in order to find their brides.\nIn the Russian versions of the story, Prince Ivan and his two older brothers shoot arrows in different directions to find brides. The other brothers' arrows land in the houses of the daughters of an aristocratic and wealthy merchant. Ivan's arrow lands in the mouth of a frog in a swamp, who turns into a princess at night. The Frog Princess, named Vasilisa the Wise, is a beautiful, intelligent, friendly, skilled girl who was forced to spend 3 years in a frog's skin for disobeying Koschei. Her final test may be to dance at the king's banquet. The Frog Princess sheds her skin, and the prince then burns it, to her dismay. Had the prince been patient, the Frog Princess would have been freed but instead he loses her. He then sets out to find her again and meets with Baba Yaga, whom he impresses with his spirit, asking why she has not offered him hospitality. She tells him that Koschei is holding his bride captive and explains how to find the magic needle needed to rescue his bride. In another version, the prince's bride flies into Baba Yaga's hut as a bird. The prince catches her, she turns into a lizard, and he cannot hold on. Baba Yaga rebukes him and sends him to her sister, where he fails again. However, when he is sent to the third sister, he catches her and no transformations can break her free again.\n\nIn some versions of the story, the Frog Princess' transformation is a reward for her good nature. In one version, she is transformed by witches for their amusement. In yet another version, she is revealed to have been an enchanted princess all along.\n\nThis tale is closely related to \"Puddocky\" and its variants, in which a king sets three tasks to his sons to determine which is best suited to rule the country, and a transformed frog helps the youngest prince.\n\n"}

{"id": "11548603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11548603", "title": "Themes in Italian Renaissance painting", "text": "Themes in Italian Renaissance painting\n\nThis article about the development of themes in Italian Renaissance painting is an extension to the article Italian Renaissance painting, for which it provides additional pictures with commentary. The works encompassed are from Giotto in the early 14th century to Michelangelo's \"Last Judgement\" of the 1530s.\n\nThe themes that preoccupied painters of the Italian Renaissance were those of both subject matter and execution- what was painted and the style in which it was painted. The artist had far more freedom of both subject and style than did a Medieval painter. Certain characteristic elements of Renaissance painting evolved a great deal during the period. These include perspective, both in terms of how it was achieved and the effect to which it was applied, and realism, particularly in the depiction of humanity, either as symbolic, portrait or narrative element.\n\nThe \"Flagellation of Christ\" by Piero della Francesca (above) demonstrates in a single small work many of the themes of Italian Renaissance painting, both in terms of compositional elements and subject matter. Immediately apparent is Piero's mastery of perspective and light. The architectural elements, including the tiled floor which becomes more complex around the central action, combine to create two spaces. The inner space is lit by an unseen light source to which Jesus looks. Its exact location can be pinpointed mathematically by an analysis of the diffusion and the angle of the shadows on the coffered ceiling. The three figures who are standing outside are lit from a different angle, from both daylight and light reflected from the pavement and buildings.\n\nThe religious theme is tied to the present. The ruler is a portrait of the visiting Emperor of Byzantium. Flagellation is also called \"scourging\". The term \"scourge\" was applied to the plague. Outside stand three men representing those who buried the body of Christ. The two older, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathaea, are believed to be portraits of men who recently lost their sons, one of them to plague. The third man is the young disciple John, and is perhaps a portrait of one of the sons, or else represents both of them in a single idealised figure, coinciding with the manner in which Piero painted angels.\n\nRenaissance painting differed from the painting of the Late Medieval period in its emphasis upon the close observation of nature, particularly with regards to human anatomy, and the application of scientific principles to the use of perspective and light.\nThe pictures in the gallery below show the development of linear perspective in buildings and cityscapes. \nThe depiction of landscape was encouraged by the development of linear perspective and the inclusion of detailed landscapes in the background of many Early Netherlandish paintings of the 15th century. Also through this influence came an awareness of atmospheric perspective and the observation of the way distant things are affected by light. \nLight and shade exist in a painting in two forms. Tone is simply the lightness and darkness of areas of a picture, graded from white to black. Tonal arrangement is a very significant feature of some paintings. Chiaroscuro is the modelling of apparent surfaces within a picture by the suggestion of light and shadow. While tone was an important feature of paintings of the Medieval period, chiaroscuro was not. It became increasingly important to painters of the 15th century, transforming the depiction of three-dimensional space.\n\nWhile remaining largely dependent upon topographic observation, the knowledge of anatomy was advanced by Leonardo da Vinci's meticulous dissection of 30 corpses. Leonardo, among others, impressed upon students the necessity of the close observation of life and made the drawing of live models an essential part of a student's formal study of the art of painting. \n\nThe observation of nature meant that set forms and symbolic gestures which in Medieval art, and particularly the Byzantine style prevalent in much of Italy, were used to convey meaning, were replaced by the representation of human emotion as displayed by a range of individuals. \nAmong the preoccupations of artists commissioned to do large works with multiple figures were how to make the subject, usually narrative, easily read by the viewer, natural in appearance and well composed within the picture space. \n\nThrough the Renaissance period, the large altarpiece had a unique status as a commission. An altarpiece was destined to become a focal point, not only visually in the religious building it occupied, but also in the devotions of the worshippers. Leonardo da Vinci's \"Madonna of the Rocks\", now in the National Gallery, London but previously in a chapel in Milan, is one of many images that was used in the petitioning of the Blessed Virgin Mary against plague. The significance of these images to those who commissioned them, who worshipped in their location, and who created them is lost when they are viewed in an art gallery.\n\n\nThe largest, most time-consuming paid work that an artist could do was a scheme of frescoes for a church, private palace or commune building. Of these, the largest unified scheme in Italy which remains more-or-less intact is that created by a number of different artists at the end of the Medieval period at the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi. It was followed by Giotto's Proto-Renaissance scheme at Padua and many others ranging from Benozzo Gozzoli's Magi Chapel for the Medici to Michelangelo's supreme accomplishment for Pope Julius II at the Sistine Chapel. \n\nDevotional images of the \"Madonna and Child\" were produced in very large numbers, often for private clients. Scenes of \"the Life of Christ\", the \"Life of the Virgin\", or \"Lives of the Saints\" were also made in large numbers for churches, particularly scenes associated with the \"Nativity\" and \"the Passion of Christ\". \"The Last Supper\" was commonly depicted in religious refectories.\n\nDuring the Renaissance an increasing number of patrons had their likeness committed to posterity in paint. For this reason there exists a great number of Renaissance portraits for whom the name of the sitter is unknown. Wealthy private patrons commissioned artworks as decoration for their homes, of increasingly secular subject matter.\n\nThese small intimate pictures, which are now nearly all in museums, were most often done for private ownership, but might occasionally grace a small altar in a chapel.\n\n\nDuring the latter half of the 15th century, there was a proliferation of portraits. Although the subjects of some of them were later remembered for their achievements or their noble lineage, the identities of many have been lost and that of even the most famous portrait of all time, Leonardo da Vinci's \"Mona Lisa\", is open to speculation and controversy.\n\nThese four famous paintings demonstrate the advent and acceptance of the nude as a subject for the artist in its own right. \n\nPaintings of classical mythology were invariably done for the important salons in the houses of private patrons. Botticelli's most famous works are for the Medici, Raphael painted \"Galatea\" for Agostino Chigi and Bellini's \"Feast of the Gods\" was, with several works by Titian, in the home of Alfonso I d'Este\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Estonian Academy of Sciences. He was the founder of the Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School. The number of his printed works exceeds 800 titles. His archive (which is now kept at the University of Tallinn and at the Tartu University Library) which includes his correspondence with a number of Russian intellectuals, is immense.\n\nYuri Lotman was born in the Jewish intellectual family of lawyer Mikhail Lotman and Sorbonne-educated dentist Aleksandra Lotman in Petrograd, Russia. His elder sister Inna Obraztsova graduated from Leningrad Conservatory and became a composer and lecturer of musical theory, his younger sister Victoria Lotman was a prominent cardiologist, and his third sister Lidia Lotman was a scholar of Russian literature of the second half of the 19th century on staff at the Institute for Russian Literature of the Russian Academy of Science (Pushkin House) (she lived in Saint-Petersburg).\n\nLotman graduated from secondary school in 1939 with excellent marks and was admitted to Leningrad State University without having to pass any exams. There he studied philology, which was a choice he made due to Lidia Lotman's university friends (actually he attended university lectures in philology whilst he was still at secondary school). His professors at university were the renowned lecturers and academicians – Gukovsky, Azadovsky, Tomashevsky and Propp. He was drafted in 1940 and during World War II served as a radio operator in the artillery. Demobilized from the army in 1946, he returned to his studies in the university and received his diploma with distinction in 1950. His first published research papers focused on Russian literary and social thought of the 18th and 19th century.\n\nUnable to find an academic position in Leningrad due to anti-Semitism (he was unable to apply for a PhD program), Lotman went to Estonia in 1950 and from 1954 began his work as a lecturer at the Department of Russian language and literature of Tartu University and later became head of the department.\n\nIn the early '60s Lotman established academic contacts with a group of structuralist linguists in Moscow, and invited them in the first Summer School on Secondary Modeling Systems, that took place in Kääriku from 19th to 29 August 1964. The group gathered at the first summer school later developed into what is now known as the Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School. Among participants of the summer school, and later members of the Tartu–Moscow school, were such names as Boris Uspensky, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Vladimir Toporov, Mikhail Gasparov, Alexander Piatigorsky, Isaak I. Revzin and Georgii Lesskis. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework around the semiotics of culture.\n\nThis school is widely known for its journal \"Sign Systems Studies\", published by Tartu University Press (formerly in Russian as \"Труды по знаковым системам\") and currently the oldest semiotics journal in the world (established in 1964). Lotman studied the theory of culture, Russian literature, history, semiotics and semiology (general theories of signs and sign systems), semiotics of cinema, arts, literature, robotics, etc. In these fields, Lotman has been one of the most widely cited authors. His major study in Russian literature was dedicated to Pushkin; among his most influential works in semiotics and structuralism are «Semiotics of Cinema», «Analysis of the Poetic Text» and «The Structure of the Artistic Text». In 1984, Lotman coined the term semiosphere.\nIn 1991 he received the Gold Medal of Philology, the highest award for a philological scholar.\n\nYuri Lotman's wife Zara Mints was also a well-known scholar of Russian literature and Tartu professor. They have three sons:\n\n\n\n\n"}
