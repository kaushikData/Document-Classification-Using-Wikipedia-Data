It was held in the United Kingdom in October 1948, and was hosted by that country's Prime Minister, Clement Attlee.\n\nIt was the first such meeting to be attended by prime ministers of recently independent Asian states:Ceylon, India and Pakistan. The growth in membership ended the previous 'intimacy' of the meeting. The issue of whether countries, specifically India, could remain Commonwealth members if they became republics was raised but was not resolved until the next conference in 1949.\n\nIreland was initially invited to attend the Conference. After Ireland announced the pending repeal of its last connection to the British king, this invitation was revoked. This was so even though at the time the British Commonwealth still regarded Ireland as one of its members. Ireland had not participated in any equivalent conferences since 1932. It had announced plans to adopt legislation severing all ties with the British crown, although at the time of the Conference, it had not yet brought that legislation into force. Irish foreign minister Sean MacBride and finance minister Patrick McGilligan attended one day of the conference as 'observers'.\n\nThe Final Communique issued by the leaders at the conclusion of the meeting saw a change in nomenclature. The terms 'Dominion' and 'Dominion Government' were superseded by 'Commonwealth country' and 'Commonwealth Government'. 'British' was omitted in front of 'Commonwealth of Nations' for the first time in the Communique.\n"}

The legal effect of the preliminary title report varies from state to state. In some states, it is treated as an abstract, making the insurer liable for errors and omissions. In other states, it is treated as only a proposal to issue title insurance. In many states, the abstractor is often an attorney who handles an escrow for the sale and who earns a commission on the sale of the title insurance policy. In a few states (e.g., California), the preliminary title report is typically prepared by the title company's staff and the commission is paid to an independent agent. In Oklahoma, abstractors are licensed. In most states, preparing an independent abstract is treated as the practice of law.\n\n"}

Air America—at its peak—became the biggest civil air fleet in the world.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the early 1970s, Indochina had been the landscape of vast major drug and military operations played by many actors including European and communist countries. When the US military involvement started, costs rose and new resources, especially for covert operations, were needed. Since the time of the Anglo-Chinese war, opium was the main source of wealth in the region. CIA and Air America flew those skies from the times of the Korean War. A new facility was built inside CIA headquarters in northern Laos where bulk opium was refined into heroin and shipped abroad. Within a decade of military intervention, in the early seventies, Indochina had become the world's leading opium producer, reaching a 70% worldwide marketshare.\n\nAir America's pilots flew dangerous missions, those no one else would fly, frequently under enemy fire.\n\nAir America's motto was \"Anything, anywhere, anytime\". \"Anything\" included food, medical supplies, weapons, and drug-related items. The most important precursors required for refining raw opium into heroin are ether and acetic anhydride. Because of its use for the synthesis of heroin by the diacetylation of morphine, acetic anhydride is today listed as a US DEA List II precursor, and officially restricted in many other countries.\n\nMany missions were in fact aid-oriented missions to provide logistical support and food to allies who were fighting the war along with the South Vietnamese and the US. Most of the time, pilots did not know what they were delivering, just when and where, no matter what the weather was like, or whether it was day or night.\n"}

The book chronicles the investigative reporting of Woodward and Bernstein from Woodward's initial report on the Watergate break-in through the resignations of H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, and the revelation of the Nixon tapes by Alexander Butterfield in 1973. It relates the events behind the major stories the duo wrote for the \"Post\", naming some sources who had previously refused to be identified for their initial articles, notably Hugh Sloan. It also gives detailed accounts of Woodward's secret meetings with his source Deep Throat, whose identity was kept hidden for over 30 years. Gene Roberts, the former executive editor of \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" and former managing editor of \"The New York Times\", has called the work of Woodward and Bernstein \"maybe the single greatest reporting effort of all time.\"\n\nA film adaptation, produced by Robert Redford, starring Redford and Dustin Hoffman as Woodward and Bernstein, respectively, was released in 1976. That same year, a sequel to the book, \"The Final Days\", was published, which chronicled the last months of Nixon's presidency, starting around the time their previous book ended.\n\nWoodward and Bernstein had considered the idea of writing a book about Watergate, but did not commit until actor Robert Redford expressed interest in purchasing the film rights. In \"Telling the Truth About Lies: The Making of \"All the President's Men\"\", Woodward noted that Redford played an important role in changing the book's narrative from a story about the Watergate events to one about their investigations and reportage of the story.\n\nThe name of the book alludes to the nursery rhyme about Humpty Dumpty (\"All the king's horses and all the king's men / Couldn't put Humpty together again\"). An allusion similar to that was made more explicitly a quarter-century earlier in the Robert Penn Warren novel \"All the King's Men\", which describes the career of a fictional corrupt governor, loosely based on Huey Long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDick Snyder of Simon & Schuster purchased the right to publish the book through the agent David Obst. The authors received an advance of $55,000. In his memoir, Michael Korda said of the book's publication that it \"transformed book publishing into a red-hot part of media\" and books became \"news\" instead of history.\n\nBecause the book was embargoed until publication day, there were no advance copies for reviewers. Simon & Schuster became known as the \"Watergate\" publisher by following up \"All the President's Men\" with books by John Dean, Maureen Dean, John Ehrlichman and John Mitchell.\n\n"}
{"id": "33436515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33436515", "title": "An Uncommon Story", "text": "An Uncommon Story\n\nAn Uncommon Story () is an autobiographical literary memoir by Ivan Goncharov, written in 1875–1876 (with an 1878 addendum) and first published in 1924. Parts of it were later included into \"The Complete Goncharov\" (1978–1980, Vol VII).\n\nAccording to the \"Gale Encyclopedia of Biography\", \"An Uncommon Story\" \"…confirmed the psychopathic side of [its author's] personality; it is an account of imagined plots against him and imagined attempts by others to plagiarize his work.\" Many researchers disagreed, finding there was much more veracity to Goncharov's claims than had previously been reported.\n\n\"An Uncommon Story\" had one single agenda: to prove that Ivan Turgenev has not only borrowed major ideas, character types, and conflicts from Goncharov's \"The Precipice\" to use in his \"Home of the Gentry\", but also (in the author's words) \"infused the best European literature with them.\" \n\n\"An Uncommon Story\" caused much debate; that it was published at all caused some controversy, for according to its author's special request, these memoirs were to be issued only in case plagiarism accusations were brought against him after his death. Since no such allegations have ever been made, Goncharov's book was formally published contrary to his will. In this same note, however, the author mentioned that he wished for future \"historians of Russian literature\" to take hold of it. \n\nIt was the latter who deemed the publication advisable since (according to scholar N. F. Budanova) \"it shed an important light upon Goncharov and Turgenev's relations,\" and also provided researchers with \"valuable material for making a comparative analysis of both classic novels which, indeed, had striking similarities.\"\n\nIn the mid-1850s, Ivan Goncharov and Ivan Turgenev were on friendly terms. Goncharov, who'd launched his career in a spectacular fashion and was declared by some a \"true Nikolay Gogol heir\", had no serious rival as a novelist on the Russian literary scene until the late 1850s; Fyodor Dostoyevsky was still in exile, Leo Tolstoy was writing novelets and short stories, and Turgenev was considered a master of miniatures. \n\nThe success of \"Home of the Gentry\" must have come as a surprise to Goncharov, who'd never considered Turgenev a novelist. In a letter dated March 28, 1859, he wrote: \"Would it be permissible for me to comment on your talent? I'd say you've got a gift for drawing tender landscapes, and have a keen ear, but you seem to be eager to erect monumental structures [...] and give us drama. Goncharov's opinion seemingly never altered.\n\nLiterary historians argued later that Turgenev's overnight success might have seemed totally undeserved for Goncharov, who, for quite a while, felt like he was the only master of his field. Goncharov produced one novel in a decade, but his new rival did it in a seemingly fleeting manner, which must have made the injustice look even more gross. \n\nOf all the possible explanations for the improbable manner in which Turgenev, a master of miniatures, could have suddenly re-invented himself as a novelist, only one for Goncharov looked plausible: the younger man must have nicked his own ideas, structures, conflicts, and character types, and \"with these pearls started to play his own lyre.\" \n\nSome commentators later dismissed such claims as borne out of jealousy, aggravated by Goncharov's natural suspiciousness, impressionability, and general hypochondria. Others argued that this would have been too simple an explanation, for while many of Goncharov's allegations were far-fetched, some were not altogether groundless. At least one fact was undisputed: in 1855, having returned from his long sea voyage, Goncharov laid out before Turgenev, his then good friend, the whole plan of his future third novel, which he has conceived as far back as 1849.\nIn 1887, four years after Turgenev's death, Goncharov attached a note to this novel's original text, which read: \"This manuscript contains the material for a novel which in 1869, as \"Vestnik Evropy\" was about to publish it, I gave the title \"The Precipice\". Before that I used to refer to is as \"Raisky, the Artist\" and was freely expounding upon it to my fellow writers, mostly to Turgenev. It was to him that in 1855, soon after returning from my around-the-world journey, I recounted in detail, in the course of several meetings, all the details of it [...] because he, being a perceptive and sensitive man of art, seemed to be most sympathetic to those of my works that he promised a great future for.\"\n\nJudging by Goncharov and Turgenev's correspondence, in the mid-1850s, the two men were very close. Goncharov valued Turgenev as a well-educated, clever critic with an impeccable literary taste. In \"An Uncommon Story\" he wrote: \"Once Turgenev told me briefly: 'As long as one single Russian remains on Earth, \"Oblomov\" will be remembered... Another time, as I was reading him form chapters I've written in Petersburg, he suddenly rose from his divan and departed to his bedroom. 'Old sparrow as I am, you touched me to tears', he said upon his return, wiping his eyes.\" \n\nTellingly, Turgenev even prompted minor detail to \"Oblomov\", namely, in the scene where Olga and Schtoltz converse in Switzerland. Goncharov acknowledged Turgenev's priority in \"discovering nihilism\", and admitted there was historical and artistic authenticity to Bazarov's character. In the late 1850s relations between the two apparently deteriorated, and in March 1860 things came to a head.\n\nPrior to the publication of \"Home of the Gentry\", Goncharov took an opportunity to get acquainted with the original text at recitals held by Turgenev for a circle of friends. He pointed to its author that many ideas, fragments of a plotline and situations looked very much like they've been copied from \"The Precipice\", the novel which was yet unpublished but very familiar to Turgenev in every detail. On March 27, 1860, Goncharov reminded Turgenev in a letter: \"Remember, there was the time when you agreed that the general plan of your novel and characters' interactions had been similar [to that of mine]; you even excluded one scene, too obviously similar to mine, which made me feel totally satisfied.\" In another letter, dated March 28, Goncharov specified the scene similar to that which involved Vera and grandmother (in \"The Precipice\"), which, being \"a weak one\", had been \"magnanimously sacrificed\" by Turgenev. The scene mentioned was absent from the final version of \"Home of the Gentry\", but references to it have been found in rough copies of the novel; this corroborated Goncharov's claim that Turgenev indeed had been making some cuts so as to make parallels less obvious. According to N. Budanova, \"it is important to bear in mind that parallels between the two novels were for all to see and Turgenev at one point conceded as much, blaming his 'over-impressionability' for this.\"\n\nOn March 29, 1860, in the critic Stepan Dudyshkin's flat an \"arbitrary court\" took place, with Pavel Annenkov, Alexander Druzhinin and Aleksandr Nikitenko present. The court's verdict was conciliatory: \"Since both Turgenev's and Goncharov's novels have had for their ground the very same soil of Russian reality, similarities and coincidences, in ideas and even phraseology, would only be natural and for both writers excusable.\" After that Goncharov and Turgenev stopped communicating. In 1864, at Druzhinin's funeral, they made peace but never became friends again, even if Turgenev in one of his letters mentioned his feeling \"very close to Goncharov.\" As Turgenev's new novels were appearing one after another, Goncharov was becoming more and more resentful, apparently seeing his worst suspicions confirmed.\n\nThe original manuscript, a notebook, consisting of 53 pages, held in the Russian National Library, according to N.Budanova, looks very much like a rough copy that's never been revisited by the author, with lots of edits, some fragments blotted out so as to be unreconstructable. The notebook consists of two parts, written in different times. Part 1, \"Uncommon Story (True Facts)\", pages 1–50, is dated December 1875 and January 1876. The author's commentary to it reads: \nPart 2, pages 51–53, dated July 1878, had another note attached to it: \"I've sealed the previous fifty pages in an envelope as finished. But in the course of the last 2.5 years lots of things have happened related to this case and I see that, having once started, I need to continue...\" There is an inscription on the envelope: \"These papers which have to do with me personally, I commit to Sophia Aleksandrovna Nikitenko for her to deal with them as I asked her to. Ivan Goncharov, May 19, 1883\".\n\n\"An Uncommon Story\" was first published in 1924 by the Russian Public Library archives, with a foreword by D. I. Abramovich. It was preceded by the publication in 1923 of the whole of the Goncharov-Turgenev correspondence by Boris Engelgardt, who accompanied it with a thorough analysis of the two authors' relations. For decades, the issue lay dormant. \n\nThen in 1972, A. Batyuto suggested Goncharov might have been a major influence on early Turgenev, after all. Having drawn the comparative analysis of Turgenev's \"On the Eve\" and Goncharov's \"The Precipice\", the author came to the conclusion: the former most obviously used \"methods of novel-structuring he'd borrowed from other writers, Goncharov included\". According to Batyuto, when it came to the art of building up a novel, Turgenev in his early days was certainly taking cues from Goncharov. \n\nIn 1976, O. Demikhovskaya in an article called \"I.A. Goncharov and I.S. Turgenev\" criticized the 'biased approach' to the problem demonstrated by Engelgardt, who in 1923 made an emphasis on Goncharov's personal idiosyncrasies as being the major factor behind the conflict. She presented Turgenev as the guilty party and recounted numerous quarrels he had with Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky.\n\nAccording to V. Nezdvedtsky, the reason behind the two writers' conflict was \"the typological resemblances of both and Goncharov's jealousy of his more fortunate rival.\" The author poined out that, while working on a completely new type of Russian novel (and leaving behind Grigorovich and Pisemsky with their traditionalism), both Goncharov (who first came up with the idea of plotline's \"poetisation\") and Turgenev were up against common challenges and were therefore keenly aware of each other's works. This by no means involved plagiarism: Goncharov himself in \"An Uncommon Story\" drew nothing but parallels, the critic argued. Nezdvetsky thought the conflict might have been easily resolved should Turgenev have been more straightforward in admitting his earlier influences. N. Budanova thought such thing would have been impossible at the time for it would have been perceived by the public as a confession of plagiarism. \n\nWhile the fact that \"The Precipice\" and \"Home of the Gentry\" had a lot in common, Goncharov's other allegations have been unanimously dismissed by literary historians as groundless. Parallels he's drawn between \"The Precipice\" and Turgenev's \"Fathers and Sons\" were proved to be far-fetched, as was his claim that \"Torrents of Spring\", was 'an improvisation' on \"The Precipice\" part I. Goncharov's claims that some European authors started to use his ideas and character types through Turgenev's influence are seen to be void, although Budanova noted that some contemporary critics might have prompted such an idea to the author who in his later life grew to be highly impressionable and suspicious. For example, Aleksey Suvorin in his article \"The French Society in Gustave Flaubert's new novel\" suggested that the \"Sentimental Education\" main character Frédéric Moreau was \"akin to the so-called 'people of the 1840s' in Russia and that he was \"similar to Raisky... its just that Flaubert has treated his character more objectively than our respected novelist.\" Some similarities between Goncharov's characters and those of Madame Bovary have been mentioned by Russian critics too.\n\nGoncharov's allegations, made in \"An Uncommon Story\", that Turgenev did a lot of harm to Russian literature in the West, have been proved invalid. On the contrary, Turgenev has been praised by many as an avid a promoter of Russian classics: his own translations of the works by Pushkin, Lermontov and Gogol into French did a lot to popularize them in Europe. Several translations of important Russian works have been made through his recommendations. \"We have every reason to insist that Turgenev preached Russian literature to the West. Forms and methods of such popularization have been different, and it is upon Turgenev's great authority that Western views on many Russian novels are still being based upon,\" wrote Soviet scholar Mikhail Alekseev in 1948.\n"}

This can refer to agreement attraction, wherein a feature is assigned based on agreement with another word. This tends to happen in English with Subject Verb Agreement, especially where the subject is separated from the verb in a complex noun phrase structure. It can also refer to Case Attraction, which assigns features based on grammatical roles, or in dialectal forms of English, Negative Attraction which extends negation particles.\n\nAgreement attraction occurs when a verb agrees with a noun other than its subject. It most commonly occurs with complex subject noun phrases, a notable example of this appeared in the New Yorker:\nThe head of the subject noun phrase, \"efforts\", is plural, but the verb appears in a singular form because the local noun \"language\" in the interceding phrase is singular, and therefore attracts the production of the singular feature in \"is\". While Bock pointed to this example, it doesn't follow the more common pattern where the local nouns are plural and attract plural marking onto the verb, such as in the sentence:\n\n\"The key to the cabinets were missing\"\n\nThe tendency for plural nouns to elicit attraction more often is caused by a marking plurality as a feature, where singularity is considered part of the default, and that activation of the noun plurality marker is what attracts the plural verb form activation. Agreement attraction not only appears with Subject Verb Agreement, but also with Object Verb agreement in WH-movement in English. Take this ungrammatical construction:\n\n\"Which flowers are the gardener planting\"\n\nThis sentence is ungrammatical because the subject \"gardener\" is singular, but \"are\" is plural, which was attracted by the plural noun object phrase \"which flowers\" that appear just before the verb due to WH-movement.\n\nObject attraction also appears in SOV constructions in Dutch, where agreement attraction occurs between the verb and the local object noun.\n\nCase attraction is the process by which a relative pronoun takes on (is \"attracted to\") the case of its antecedent rather than having the case appropriate to its function in the relative clause. For example, in the following English sentence, the relative pronoun has the appropriate case, the accusative:\n\nThe following erroneous sentence, on the other hand, has case attraction:\n\nBecause the antecedent, \"[of] the man\", is possessive, the relative pronoun has become possessive as well. Attraction is a theoretical process in Standard English, but it is common in the Greek of the Septuagint and also occurs in the New Testament.\n"}

A Creole archaeologist was trained in London to be the museum's future director, and was made head of the department of museums.\nThe People's United Party regained office in the 1989 election, and Duran was again placed in charge of planning for the new Museum of Belize, while Duran's wife was put in charge of the state's archaeological collection.\n\nThe museum building for the new Museum of Belize in Belmopan, designed by Mexican architects, was to have covered in a park.\nIt was to have been a 2-story building around a glass-roofed patio, connected to an outdoor amphitheatre with 600 seats.\nThe museum would have two main exhibit spaces on the ground floor, called \"lungs\", one about society and the other about the environment.\nUnder the dome it would hold the most traditional exhibit, the Ancient Maya Gallery, planned by specialists from the Royal Ontario Museum. The exhibit would have a glass floor over a reconstruction of a half-excavated Mayan tomb.\nIn June 1993 the plans for the museum were settled and construction of the museum building had begun.\nIt was to be the largest building in the country, equipped with the latest technology to showcase Belize.\nA national election defeated the government and the plans were abandoned.\n\nThe Belize Department of Archaeology was created in 1957 with a staff of one person.\nAs of 1996 the Belmopan Vault in the Department of Archaeology held some of the archaeological remains of the country.\nMost of the display consisted of ceramic vessels from across Belize.\nThey were packed tightly and did not have labels.\nA group of 24 vases salvaged in 1973 from the Hokeb Ha cave in Toledo, southern Belize, was the most interesting part of the collection.\nAt that time the vault was open in the afternoon on Monday, Wednesday and Friday by prior appointment.\nA 1997 guide said that the Archaeology Vault in Belmopan, which had been open for visitors to see a large collection of Mayan artifacts, had been closed for lack of funding.\nThe Department of Archaeology had absorbed the Department of Museums, and plans to replace the Archaeology Vault with a National Museum of Belize were uncertain.\nThe guide noted rumors that some of the valuable artifacts might have been sold abroad, and their absence from the collection would be embarrassing.\n\nIn August 2003 the National Institute of Culture and History (NICH) was created, and the former Department of Archaeology became the Institute of Archaeology within the NICH.\nThe Institute of Archaeology manages all of Belize's archaeological and cultural resources.\nIt is located in the Archaeology Museum and Research Centre, Culvert Road, Belmopan.\nAs of 2004 the Institute of Archaeology gave tours of their collection in Belmopan.\nThe institute also had an impressive research library.\nThe Archaeology Museum contains a selection of artifacts and relics from the past.\nMost of the building is used for research and to store the library collections, rather than exhibiting objects.\nHowever, the museum presents an interesting collection of pottery and tools.\n\nA 2006 guide said the archaeological collection in the Belmopan Museum was interesting, but the museum was closed for renovations.\nIt was due to open again in January 2007.\nThe Department of Archaeology could provide leaflets and brochures about the museum.\nThe building plot for the new museum was sold just before the 2008 elections.\nIn November 2014 the Belmopan Business Network said it was interested in reviving the Belmopan Museum.\nIn late 2014 a contract was signed to build a new Museum of Belize in Belmopan, replacing the museum opened in 2002 in Belize City. \nThe new museum was to form the center of the National Institute of Culture and History (NICH) network of cultural and heritage sites.\n\n"}

Candace Mossler and her husband were separated at the time of his murder. Jacques Mossler had considered suing Powers and divorcing his wife but, upon consultation with his lawyer, had decided against doing so in order to avoid the negative publicity and losing half of his fortune to Candace. At the time of her husband's murder, she was on a $5,000 a week stipend allocated for household upkeep.\n\nDuring initial interviews with police officers, Candace Mossler asserted that she believed her husband's death was a result of a burglary gone wrong. However, when the officers stated they believed the murder was a crime of passion, noting that Jacques Mossler had been stabbed over thirty times before being bludgeoned over the head with a glass bowl, Candace changed her story, saying that she believed that her husband had been a closet homosexual, and had been cheating on her with another man who could have possibly committed the crime. As her husband had been found wearing only a bath robe, officers pursued this lead until they found Jacques' diary, which cast suspicion directly upon his wife and his nephew.\n\nAmerica's newspapers and magazines took note of the salacious case, and a drumbeat began to build for indictment of Candace Mossler. It finally came on July 20, 1965. Candy Mossler was represented by a pair of Houston's best defense attorneys Clyde Woody and Marian Rosen. Melvin Powers was defended by top rank Houston defense lawyers Percy Foreman and William F Walsh, the former a high-profile attorney who later defended James Earl Ray, the man convicted of killing Martin Luther King, Jr. As the assets Candy was set to inherit from her late husband were frozen at the time of her arrest pending the investigation of his death, Candace paid Foreman's retainer with jewelry, diamonds, and furs that had been bought for her by her late husband before their separation.\n\nCandy Mossler had flown to Rochester, Minnesota prior to her arrest in order to undergo treatment at the Mayo Clinic for migraines, but agreed to fly to Miami to surrender rather than risk the indignity of a surprise arrest. Accompanied by a private nurse and wearing a Mayo Clinic wrist identification band, she flew from Minnesota to Miami International Airport, where she was treated to a genteel arrest by a state police commander. A mighty press contingent had gathered at the airport, and Candy smiled and posed for them. When reporters confronted her with allegations of adultery, incest, and murder, she simply replied, \"Well, nobody's perfect.\"\n\nCandy, a bouncy former model with platinum blond hair and a southern accent, was notable for her on-camera charm. While jail inmates shouted obscenities at her, she would smile and blow kisses at the cameras.\n\nShe rented two adjoining flats at the White Hall Apartments on the North West side of town, and her children joined her. Meanwhile, investigators in Texas and Florida continued working for months to string together evidence. Each thread seemed to lead to Mel Powers, Candy Mossler, or both.\n\nPolice officers turned up four witnesses who claimed the lovers solicited a hit on \"the old mooch.\" The investigators lined up a long list of witnesses—neighbors, employees, hotel clerks—who said they saw Mel and Candy share affectionate moments. Cops found a photographic record of Candy and Mel's travels—souvenir snapshots from nightclubs, ski slopes, concerts.\n\nThe courtroom was filled to maximum capacity with spectators every day of the murder trial, people bringing their lunches with them and eating during court processions in order to retain their seats all day. The subject matter was considered so prurient that people under the age of 21 were turned away. During the course of their trial, lawyer Percy Foreman declined to call any witnesses to the stand, in direct contrast to the district attorney, who called a number of questionably relevant witnesses. Instead, Foreman emphasized his closing statement which, by many accounts, was extremely compelling. Both Mossler and Powers were acquitted.\n\nPolice officers and the district attorney's office declined to continue the search for Jacques' murderers afterwards, as they maintained their initial conclusion that Candace and her lover had committed the crime. Eventually, Powers and Mossler drifted apart and Mossler remarried.\n\nCandace Mossler died of an accidental overdose of migraine medication on 26 October 1976 at age 56, in Miami Beach, Florida. \n\n"}

In hindsight, it is clear that Polk's threat of war was hardly an exaggeration. During the course of the war, some of the more aggressive expansionists in Congress called for the U.S. to annex all of Mexico, which was within feasibility from a military standpoint but objectionable politically, primarily due to the unsettled question of slavery in the annexed territories.

{"id": "29854384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29854384", "title": "Communication privacy management theory", "text": "Communication privacy management theory\n\nCommunication privacy management (CPM), originally known as communication boundary management, is a systematic research theory designed to develop an evidence-based understanding of the way people make decisions about revealing and concealing private information. CPM theory suggests that individuals maintain and coordinate privacy boundaries (the limits of what they are willing to share) with various communication partners depending on the perceived benefits and costs of information disclosure. It was first developed by Sandra Petronio in 1991.\n\nPetronio uses a boundary metaphor to explain the privacy management process. Privacy boundaries draw divisions between private information and public information. This theory argues that when people disclose private information, they depend on a rule-based management system to control the level of accessibility. An individual's privacy boundary governs his or her\nself-disclosures. Once a disclosure is made, the negotiation of privacy rules between the two parties is required. A\ndistressing sense of \"boundary turbulence\" can arise when\nclashing expectations for privacy management are identified. Having the mental image of protective boundaries is central to understanding the five core principles of Petronio's CPM:\n\n(1) People believe they own and have a right to control their private information. (2) People control their private information through the use of personal privacy rules. (3) When others are told or given access to a person's private information, they become co-owners of that information. (4) Co-owners of private information need to negotiate mutually agreeable privacy rules about telling others. (5) When co-owners of private information don't effectively negotiate and follow mutually held privacy rules, boundary turbulence is the likely result.\n\nPetronio's communication privacy management (CPM) theory is built on Altman's dialectical\nconception of privacy as a process of opening and closing a boundary to others. Altman and Taylor's social penetration theory focused on self-disclosure as the primary way to develop close relationships. However, openness is only part of the story. We also have a desire for privacy. When Petronio first developed this theory in 1991, it was called \"communication boundary management\". In 2002, she renamed it to \"communication privacy management\", underscoring private disclosure as the main thrust of the theory.\n\n\nThe content of concealing and revealing is private information. Petronio favored the term \"private information\" over the term \"self-disclosure\" because there are many caveats inherent to private information disclosure that are not present with self-disclosure. Firstly, the motivations behind sharing are many, including but not limited to: sharing a burden, righting a wrong, and influencing others. Since private information can be about yourself or others, the decision as to what is private and whom to share it with plays a part when taking the idea of boundaries into consideration. The decision to share is ultimately left up to the process of the privacy rule management system which combines rules for coordination of information, characteristics of disclosure, and attributes of the nature of boundaries.\n\nTo understand CPM theory it is important to follow the metaphor of the boundary. Private boundaries are the division between private information and public information. When private information is shared, there will be a collective boundary. When private information remains with an individual and is not disclosed, the boundary is called a personal boundary. An individual's private information is protected by their boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing. Boundaries can be relatively permeable (easy to cross) or relatively impregnable (rigid and difficult to cross).\nCommunication privacy management theory understands information (as well as boundaries) as something that is owned, and each owner must decide whether or not they are willing to have a confidant, i.e. a co-owner, to that information. In some cases, it is preferable for the owner to have another person share the private information, though this may not be the case for the confidant. Co-ownership of information is characterized by two things: heavy responsibility and a knowledge of the rules for a particular disclosure. However, ownership can be felt to different degrees, and the understanding of disclosure rules can be different from owner to owner. Also, the act of sharing is coupled along with the realization that boundaries have expanded and that they may never return to their original state. It is the responsibility of co-owners to decide and make clear if, when, and how information can or should be shared with others.\n\nAs the framework for understanding the decisions people make about private information, this system allows for management on the individual and collective levels through three processes: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.\n\nPetronio's understanding and argument of privacy management rests on the idea that a dialectic exists wherever the decision is made to disclose or conceal private information. Thus, costs and benefits must be weighed and consideration must be given to how such information will be owned, used, and spread. The definition of dialectic that Petronio borrows from can be found in Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery's theory of relational dialectics, wherein various approaches to the contradictory impulses of relational life are discussed. The theory focuses on the idea that there are not only two contradictory stances within a relationship, but that at any given moment decisions are weighed using multiple viewpoints.\n\nPetronio views boundary management as a rule based process, not an individual decision. This rule-based management system allows for management on the individual and collective levels. This system depends on three privacy rule management to regulate the process of revealing and concealing private information: privacy rule characteristics, boundary coordination, and boundary turbulence.\n\nThe characteristics of privacy rules are divided into two sections, attributes and development. Privacy rule attributes refer to how people obtain rules of privacy and understand the properties of those rules. This is normally done through social interactions where the boundaries for rules are put to the test. Rules are set in different social situations which dictate the type of disclosure that should be made, for example, the difference between disclosure at a family member's birthday party versus an office event at work. Petronio asserts that each situation will come with its own set of rules for managing privacy that are learned over time. The development of privacy rule characteristics has to do with the criteria implemented to decide if and how information will be shared. Communication privacy management theory general lists those criteria as the following:\n\nWith these five criteria, personal and group privacy rules are developed, but disclosure of private information necessitates the inclusion of others within the boundary of knowledge, which demands an understanding between parties for how to coordinate ownership of knowledge.\n\nAn individual's private information is protected by the individual's boundaries. The permeability of these boundaries are ever-changing, and allow certain parts of the public access to certain pieces of information belonging to the individual. Once private information is shared, co-owners must coordinate the boundaries of privacy and disclosure based on boundary permeability, boundary linkage, and boundary ownership. Petronio describes this mutual boundary coordination by co-owners as drawing the same borders on a map around a shared piece of information. By no means is this an easy process considering that each owner will approach the information from distinct viewpoints and referencing their personal criteria for privacy rule development. \n\nOften, boundaries are not coordinated as well as they should be to maintain the level of privacy or exposure desired by owners – this leads to problems known as boundary turbulence. The coordination of shared boundaries is key to avoiding over-sharing. When the boundaries are unclear, owners may come into conflict with one another. Turbulence among co-owners is caused when rules are not mutually understood by co-owners and when the management of private information comes into conflict with the expectations each owner had, which can happen for a number of reasons.\n\nBoundary turbulence can be caused by mistakes, such as an uninvited party overhearing private information (causing weak boundary linkage) or a disclosure an owner might make under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. Disclosure to a new party was not the intent, but, when it happens, other co-owners can feel that their expectations of maintaining boundaries have been violated.\n\nIn addition, boundary turbulence occurs when a co-owner intentionally breaks the coordinated boundary of privacy to disclose private information. An example of such intentional disclosure would be a daughter revealing to a doctor that her father is indeed an active smoker when the father has told the doctor that he no longer smokes after his heart surgery. The daughter in this case must weigh the risks of breaking the family privacy boundary against the benefits of the doctor being better informed of her father's condition.\n\nLastly, boundary turbulence can also occur when there have not been pre-existing rules for a situation. For example, with the emergence of social media and, in particular, Facebook, boundary rules had not been established. As parents began to join Facebook and \"friend\" their children, the children felt turbulence. There was a perception of privacy invasion between the parent-child relationship.\n\nIn cases of boundary turbulence, co-owners of information can feel that their expectations have been violated and lose trust in other co-owners. In these cases, the goal of each party is to reduce turbulence by reestablishing and coordinating boundaries. It should be noted, however, that turbulence doesn't always have a negative outcome, there has been studies which show that turbulence within relationships can lead to stronger and improved relationships.\n\nCommunication privacy management can be applied across different contexts, primarily include: (1) family communication, with a particular focus on parental privacy invasions, (2) online social media, (3) health, and (4) relational issues, and (5) work environments.\n\nSpecific applications of CPM highlight family privacy management. Research focused on secrets and topic avoidance, such as questions of concealment to stepfamily members feeling caught, and parents-adolescent conversations about sex. Family privacy research over the decades are also inspired specifically by the chapter of parental privacy invasion. For example, work by Hawk and his colleagues explore perceived parental invasions from the view of adolescents in reaction to such issues as control attempts, solicitation of information, and conflict outcomes. Another way that family communication uses CPM is with child bearing or the lack thereof; whom childless-couples choose to disclose to that they voluntarily do not want children is another way CPM has been explored.\n\nPregnancy loss due to miscarriage could be a unique CPM case in the family setting as couples often manage this information jointly as they decide whether to share the miscarriage with people outside the dyad. The research found that couples frame miscarriage as a shared but distinct experience and that both members exert rights of ownership over the information. Couples' privacy rules centered on issues of social support and others' need to know about the loss. Even though couples described their privacy rules as implicitly understood, they also recalled having explicit conversations to develop rules. We discuss how the management of co-owned information can improve communication and maintain relationships.\n\nRecent researchers apply CPM to investigate privacy management for online blogging, Facebook usage and online dating. Further, there have been investigations into parental behavior that is enacted through online social media; specifically when parents 'friend' their children and the management of privacy that ensues from that. Privacy practices in social network sites often appear paradoxical, as content-sharing behavior stands in conflict with the need to reduce disclosure-related harms. Some study explore privacy in social network sites as a contextual information practice, managed by a process of boundary regulation.\n\nSimilar research has been done on the perceptions of teachers' disclosures on Facebook and their impact on credibility. The relevance and valence of disclosures were compared between disclosures made in the classroom and those made on Facebook and were found to be significantly different. Students' perceptions of teacher credibility were shown to decrease as relevance of disclosures increased and as negativity increased.\n\nAnother popular SNS Twitter was examined as well. In the research, Twitter was regarded as an onion with multiple privacy layers. The research found out that there were significant differences at the descriptive and inferential levels among the multiple dimensions of private information, including daily lives, social identity, competence, socio-economic status, and health. Private information regarding daily lives and entertainment was disclosed easily and located at the outermost layer of the disclosure onion. In contrast, health-related private information was concealed and located within the innermost layer of the disclosure onion. What's more, there were significant differences among current Twitter users, nonusers, and dropouts with regard to personality traits and privacy concerns about Twitter.\n\nYoung people especially highschool and college students are an important part of SNS users. A recent study examined college students' privacy concerns and impacts on their Twitter usage behaviors. Regression analyses concluded that Control and Boundary Rules of Private Information on Twitter significantly predict daily minutes spent on Twitter accounts. However, the same CPM variables did not predict college students' other Twitter usage behaviors (e.g., weekly inquiries and total months of using Twitter). This shows the intricate connection between students' privacy concern and their usage behavior.\n\nInformed by principles of CPM, health communication research using CPM to explore health privacy issues has become a growth area. Earlier study investigated physician disclosure of medical mistakes. Recently there have been a number of studies focused on ways that privacy issues influence patient care, confidentiality and control over ownership, choices about disclosure, for instance, with stigmatized health-related illness such as HIV/AIDS, about e-health information, and the digitization of healthcare.\n\nOne recent study about how overweight and obese individuals handle their personal history after they become a normal weight. The result shows that the vast majority of participants perceived more benefits from disclosing their larger identity than risks, regardless of weight-loss method.\n\nUsing CPM, \"Celebrity Health Narratives & the Public Health\" offers the \"first extensive look at celebrity health sagas, this book examines the ways in which their stories become our stories, influencing public perception and framing dialog about wellness, disease and death. These private-yet-public narratives drive fund-raising, reduce stigma and influence policy. Celebrities such as Mary Tyler Moore, Robin Roberts, Michael J. Fox, and Christopher Reeve—as well as 200 others included in the study—have left a lasting legacy.\"\n\nMany studies emphasize the use of CPM in relationships because of the concepts of disclosure and boundaries. Not only romantic relationships, but also friendships are a factor when thinking of CPM. Briefly, work on conflict and topic avoidance, considering the relational impact of privacy turbulence, students and faculty relationships, and workplace relationships have all produced useful information that opens new doors regarding CPM-based research.\n\nThe mobile phone and its impact on romantic relationships is a good example. After investigating mobile phone usage rules that are negotiated by adolescents and young adults in romantic relationships, findings are that the negotiation of rules is a crucial part of young adult relationships while enhancing trust and fostering harmony were important factors in the rule development process.\n\nCPM also appears in the friendship. The study intended to addresses the issue of whether personal traits and predispositions can predict the tendencies to either reveal or conceal secrets shared in confidence by a best friend suggested that a combination of several traits could successfully distinguish those who revealed secrets from those who did not. Significant discriminators included tendency to gossip and depth of disclosure. Implications of the study and suggestions for future research are discussed.\n\nAlthough privacy violations can be uncomfortable and disruptive, they have the potential for positive outcomes in relationships if addressed. Using CPM theory as a framework, a study surveyed a community sample of 273 adults to examine their retrospective accounts of privacy violations in personal relationships. Results showed that less than half of the sample offered explicit rules for information management, and the majority of participants blamed the confidant for the privacy turbulence. Findings indicated that people often do not share similar information with the violator in the future, but if they do, less than half offer explicit privacy rules during the privacy recalibration process. Confrontation efficacy was positively associated with initiating a conversation about the privacy turbulence and that people who engaged in privacy recalibration were more likely to report forgiveness and relational improvement and less likely to report relational damage than those individuals who did not.\n\nCPM has become very applicable in the workplace as personal mobile devices have increasingly been allowed to be brought to work. The concept of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) has stirred conversation on the concept of privacy, security and boundaries between employee and employer. Companies have had to take measures to further secure their network or even decide whether they want to have employee access personal accounts (i.e. email) or devices while on the job. By the same token, some employees argue that companies should not be able to track what is being done on their personal devices or even on company computers even if they are in the work place.\nEven before stepping foot into the workplace, much can be said about CPM and interviewing. How much we decide to reveal within an interview and the boundaries we have in that situation is directly related to CPM. Even interviewing within a job (as a cop, for example) requires a certain sensitivity to people's boundaries and how much private information they are willing to reveal.\n\nSeveral studies tested CPM within intercultural contexts. For instance, a study that examined intercultural privacy management between foreign English teachers and Japanese co-workers uncovered cultural premises. This \"study highlights four cultural premises that garner intercultural privacy management between foreign English language teachers (ELTs) and Japanese coworkers (JCWs) in Japan. The analysis revealed that ELTs: (a) expected not to be a \"free space\" for privacy inquisition by JCWs, and (b) expected voluntary reciprocity in (egalitarian) workplace relationships. JCWs viewed: (a) privacy inquisitions as acts of kindness/caring and (b) soliciting help from a supervisor as providing opportunities for better care. This study calls for attention to intercultural privacy management and enhances CPM's cultural criteria.\" Within the same context, foreign English teachers \"employed the following management strategies: (a) withdrawal, (b) cognitive restructuring, (c) independent control, (d) lying, (e) omission, (f) avoidance, and (g) gaijin smashing. Japanese co-workers defined privacy as information that should be hidden and managed such information by: (a) drawing clear boundaries by not talking or changing contexts, and (b) being pre-emptive by demarcating privacy boundaries early on within a relationship.\"\n\nThere are a few communication theories that are worth noting after understanding CPM in more depth.\n\nExpectancy violations theory discusses the importance of personal space, territoriality and the expectations individuals have of another's non verbal communication. Though dealing with physical proximity, we can see the relation between expectancy violations theory and CPM as it pertains to privacy and how close we allow another to come to us. Both physical and intimate proximity requires boundaries to be crossed or permeated.\n\nSocial penetration theory explains how two individuals grow in intimacy and move from one level to the next in their relationships. The popular idea behind social penetration is that individual are like onions; they have layers and as you go deeper, the more intimate you become. For this intimacy to occur, we can safely say that private information needs to be shared and exchanged. As one does this, boundaries are permeated and become co-owned.\n\nFinally, coordinated management of meaning explains how people establish rules for both creating and interpreting meaning. Similar to CPM, coordinated management of meaning has stages were coordination is achieved, not achieved, or partially achieved. Similarly you can have boundary ownership, boundary turbulence or boundary linkage. Moreover, in order to achieve meaning there needs to be an exchange of information between individuals to decipher. This exchange of private information falls directly into CPM.\n\nCommunication privacy management theory utilizes a socio-cultural communication tradition within an interpersonal context, and employs both a positivistic and interpretive approach to knowing.\n\nAltman speaks to the values of this theory as it advances our thinking by incorporating different \"levels\" or combinations of participants in communication processes (Altman 2002). Whereas earlier research and theorizing on privacy-disclosure focused on dyads or individuals, a most complicated set of dynamics has been carefully enunciated by Petronio. Petronio also describes communication within families and between family members and outsiders, within and outside work and social groups, and between many combinations of individuals, dyads, and others within and across social boundaries. In addition, her analysis of privacy-disclosure \"turbulence\", or breaches of desired communication patterns, is articulate and systematic.\n\nSome researchers have questioned whether CPM theory truly is dialectical in nature. It has argued that CPM takes a dualistic approach, treating privacy and disclosure as independent of one another and able to coexist in tandem rather than in the dynamic interplay characteristic of dialectics. This accusation of dualistic thinking might result from the theory's use of the terms \"balance\" and \"equilibrium\" in the early versions of CPM theory. Petronio argues that CPM is not focused on balance in the psychological sense. \"Instead, [CPM] argues for coordination with others that does not advocate an optimum balance between disclosure and privacy. As an alternative, the theory claims there are shifting forces with a range of privacy and disclosure that people handle by making judgments about the \"degrees\" [emphasis in original] of privacy and publicness they wish to experience in any given interaction\" (pp. 12–13). Thus, Petronio argues that it is legitimate to call CPM theory dialectical in nature.\n\n"}

Along with the Day of the Sun, the birthday of his father Kim Il-sung, it is the most important public holiday in the country.\n\nKim Jong-il was born in 1941 in the Soviet Union, although North Korean propaganda insists on the date 16 February 1942 and places the birth at the Mount Paektu area in Korea. His birthday became an official holiday in 1982 when he began his work in the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea. During his lifetime, he kept out of the public eye during his birthdays. In 2012, the year following his death, the holiday was renamed the Day of the Shining Star.\n\nThe most lavish observances take place in the capital Pyongyang and include mass gymnastics, music performances, fireworks displays, military demonstrations, and mass dancing parties. The North Korean people receive more food rations and electricity than usual on the Day of the Shining Star.\n\nKim Jong-il was born in February 1941 to Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-suk in Siberia in the Russian Federal Republic, Soviet Union where his father had been in exile because of his guerilla activities. North Korean propaganda, however, dates Kim Jong-il's birth to 16 February 1942 and locates it at the Mount Paektu area in Korea, the mythical place of origin of the Korean people, where Kim Il-sung supposedly ran a guerilla camp. In reality, the guerillas were based in Manchuria at the time and Kim himself had been to the Soviet Far East before and after Kim Jong-il's birth.\n\nIn North Korean propaganda, Kim Jong-il is often associated with the image of the star. He is most often referred to as the \"bright star\", although the \"shining star\" () is also used. According to legend, a bright star appeared on the sky the night he was born, and guerilla fighters carved messages on trees proclaiming: \"Three Heroes Shining in Korea with the Spirit of Mount Paekdu: Kim Il Sung, Kim Chŏng-suk, and \"Kwangmyŏngsŏng\" ('The Bright Star')\" and \"Oh! Korea! The Paekdu Star Was Born!\"\n\nKim's birthday had been provisionally celebrated from 1976 on, but it became a national holiday only in 1982, two days after he became a member of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea. When he ascended to the leadership of the country, his birthday was marked as \"The Spring of Humanity\" on the North Korean calendar. During his lifetime, though, Kim shunned away from public occasions during his birthdays. The anniversary got its present name in 2012, the year following his death, when the Politburo announced that: \"February 16, the greatest auspicious holiday of the nation when the great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il was born, will be instituted as the Day of the Shining Star\". An equestrian statue with Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung was revealed to commemorate the day.\n\nOn 12 February 2013, North Korea conducted its third nuclear test a few days before the Day of the Shining Star in celebration of it.\n\nThe holiday begins on 16 February and lasts for two days. Celebrations are observed throughout the country. The capital, Pyongyang, has observances such as mass gymnastics, music performances, fireworks displays, military demonstrations, and mass dancing parties. Boulevards are lined up with flags and banners. Millions of people visit the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun where both Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il lay in state. Exhibitions of the orchid Kimjongilia take place. The orchid is named after Kim and has been cultivated to bloom around the Day of the Shining Star. Outside of Pyongyang, commemorations are not as lavish. The North Korean government often allocates more food and energy to the people on Day of the Shining Star than normally. Children are given candy, and it is one of the few occasions on which new members are admitted in the Korean Children's Union. Vitaly Mansky's 2015 documentary film \"Under the Sun\" chronicles the run up to such a ceremony on the Day of the Shining Star.\n\nGovernment and business offices, banks, and retail close for the Day of the Shining Star. Weddings are commonly held on the Day of the Shining Star.\n\nThe two-month period between the Day of the Shining Star and the Day of the Sun is known as the Loyalty Festival Period and festivities occur throughout. On the calendar, the Day of the Shining Star takes place after the Generalissimo Day (14 February, commemorating Kim Jong-il's accession to the rank of \"Taewonsu\") and before the International Women's Day (8 March). The Day of the Shining Star is one of three days celebrating Kim Jong-il on the calendar, the other two being the Generalissimo Day and the Day of \"Songun\" (25 August, commemorating the beginning of Kim's \"Songun\", or army-first, leadership).\n\n\n"}

Deaccessioning is a practical and constructive tool of collections care that, if practiced thoughtfully supports the long-term preservation of a collection and can help a museum refine the scope of its collection in order to better serve its mission and community.\n\nThe process undertaken by a museum to deaccession a work involves several steps that are usually laid out in a museum`s Collection Management Policy. The terms under which an object may be considered for removal, as well as the individuals with the authority to approve the process are outlined in the \"Deaccession\" section of this document. Additionally, this section lays out the legal restrictions and ethic considerations associated with removal of the object and the types of disposal that are appropriate based on the reason for the deaccession.\n\nEach museum establishes its own method and workflow for the deaccession process according to its organizational structure. However all object deaccessioning involves the two processing steps of deaccession and disposal.\n\nThe process begins with the curator creating a document called a \"Statement of Justification,\" which outlines their decision criteria and reasoning for presenting the work as a possible deaccession. In order to determine if a work should be deaccessioned from a museum`s collection, a curator or registrar completes and documents a series of justification steps and then present their findings to the museum director and governing board for final approval.\n\nThere are a number of reasons why deaccessioning might be considered. The following is a typical list of criteria for deaccession and disposal:\n\n\nThe typical steps that need to be taken in order to justify the deaccession and disposal of the work include:\n\n\nDisposal is defined as the transfer of ownership by the museum after a work has been deaccessioned. Following approval of deaccession from the Governing Board and/or the CEO/Museum Director, the work is disposed of and the title of ownership is completely transferred away from the museum or terminated. The method chosen is determined by the physical condition of the work, the intrinsic value or cultural value of the work and extrinsic value or monetary value of the work. With all methods of disposal, museums are charged to maintain and retain all records of the object, its deaccession and disposal.\n\nThe process of disposal is completed through the following methods:\n\n\nSeveral professional museum associations have drafted codes of ethics governing the practice of deaccession.nTwo majors areas of ethical concern that are common in these codes of ethics are the prohibition of sale or transfer of collection items to museum trustees, staff, board members, or their relatives and the need to restrict the use of proceeds from any works disposed of via sale or auction.\n\nThe first of these ethical concerns is rather straightforward. The second has become a point of contention in recent years since museums and cities, like Detroit, have been struggling with financial shortfalls.\n\nAccording to the AAMD (The Association of Art Museum Directors): \"Funds received from the disposal of a deaccessioned work shall not be used for operations or capital expenses. Such funds, including any earnings and appreciation thereon, may be used only for the acquisition of works in a manner consistent with the museum’s policy on the use of restricted acquisition funds.\"\n\nAccording to the AAM (the American Association of Museums): \"Proceeds from the sale of nonliving collections are to be used consistent with the established standards of the museum`s discipline, but in no event shall they be used for anything other than acquisition or direct care of collections.\"\n\nAccording to the AASLH (the American Association for State and Local History): \"Collections shall not be deaccessioned or disposed of in order to provide financial support for institutional operations, facilities maintenance, or any reason other than the preservation or acquisition of collections.\"\n\nAccording to ICOM (the International Council of Museums): Proceeds should be applied solely to the purchase of additions to museum collections.\n\nThese associations have each determined to their own degree that all proceeds from sale or auction should be restricted to the future acquisition of collection objects and/ or to the ongoing maintenance of current collection holdings. Their decision and perspective on the practice of deaccession reflects a long-term view of museum collections as items held in public trust and preserved for access, appreciation, education, and enjoyment of not only today`s public but the future public. See Public trust doctrine\n\nDeaccessioning is a controversial topic and activity, with diverging opinions from artists, arts professionals and the general public. Some commentators, such as Donn Zaretsky of The Art Law Blog critique the notion of \"the public trust\" and argue that deaccessioning rules should probably be thrown out altogether. Others, such as Susan Taylor, director of the New Orleans Museum of Art and the AAMD's current president, believes that proceeds from the sale or funds from the deaccession can only be used to buy other works of art.\n\n"}

{"id": "3975200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3975200", "title": "Gatekeeping (communication)", "text": "Gatekeeping (communication)\n\nGatekeeping is the process through which information is filtered for dissemination, whether for publication, broadcasting, the Internet, or some other mode of communication. The academic theory of gatekeeping is founded in multiple fields of study, including communication studies, journalism, political science, and sociology. It was originally focused on the mass media with its few-to-many dynamic but now gatekeeping theory also addresses face-to-face communication and the many-to-many dynamic inherent in the Internet. The theory was first instituted by social psychologist Kurt Lewin in 1943. Gatekeeping occurs at all levels of the media structure—from a reporter deciding which sources are chosen to include in a story to editors deciding which stories are printed or covered, and includes media outlet owners and even advertisers. Individuals can also act as gatekeepers, deciding what information to include in an email or in a blog. \n\nGatekeeping is a process by which information is filtered to the public by the media. According to Pamela Shoemaker and Tim Vos, gatekeeping is the \"process of culling and crafting countless bits of information into the limited number of messages that reach people every day, and it is the center of the media's role in modern public life. [...] This process determines not only which information is selected, but also what the content and nature of the messages, such as news, will be.\"\n\n\nGatekeeping as a news process was identified in the literature as early as 1922, though not yet given a formal theoretical name. In his book \"The Immigrant Press\", Park explains the process, \"out of all of the events that happen and are recorded every day by correspondents, reporters, and the news agencies, the editor chooses certain items for publication which he regards as more important or more interesting than others. The remainder he condemns to oblivion and the wastebasket. There is an enormous amount of news 'killed' every day\" (p. 328).\n\nFormally, gatekeeping was identified in Lewin's (1943) publication \"Forces Behind Food Habits and Methods of Change\". Working during World War II, Kurt Lewin conducted field research initially among Midwestern housewives to determine how to effectively change their families' food consumption during this time of war. Lewin recognized that for food to go from a store or a garden to the dining table, there were various decision-making processes it had to pass on the way there. At a time when men were thought to control all household decisions, Lewin found that \"food does not move by its own impetus. Entering or not entering a channel and moving from one section of a channel to another is affected by a 'gatekeeper'\" (p. 37). The gatekeeper, in this case, was typically the housewife, or sometimes a maid in more affluent households. Lewin's research demonstrated that not all members of a family have equal weight in making household food decisions and that the wife, who typically shops for and prepares the food controls the gates, based on a variety of considerations. Lewin's study published in 1943 became the impetus for another article in 1947 in which he introduces the idea of feedback in group decision making, which complicates the role of the gatekeeper. Feedback acknowledges that the set of considerations a gatekeeper uses in making decisions may vary depending on considerations of the group.\n\nIn 1950, David Manning White, a journalism professor at Boston University, looked at the factors an editor takes into consideration when deciding which news will make the paper and which news will not; intending to examine how a \"gate keeper\" examines his \"gate\" within a channel of mass communication. White contacted an editor, a man in his mid-40s with 25 years of experience, whom he calls \"Mr. Gates.\" Mr. Gates was the wire editor of a morning newspaper in a mid-west city of 100,000 that had a circulation of 30,000. During the case study, Mr. Gates retained all copy that he rejected from the paper for a week. At the end of his shift, he made notes on why that story was rejected, assuming he could still remember the reason.\n\nAt the end of the week that the study took place, White found that nine-tenths of the wire copy got rejected and the process is made by highly subjective decisions based on the editor's own set of experiences, attitudes and expectations. White found that in this particular study, the majority of the rejections could be classified in two ways: 1) not worthy of being reported or 2) there was another story on the same event. Pertaining to the first reason, many of the explanations Mr. Gates gives for rejection are \"highly-subjective value judgments.\" Examples of this are seen when Mr. Gates writes \"too Red\" or \"don't care for suicides\" (386). Pertaining to the second reason of rejection, given for the majority of the rejections, Mr. Gates made no \"personal\" rejections to the copy, but there was simply no space available for it in the paper. The later the story came to Mr. Gates, the less of a chance it had to take up any valuable space remaining.\n\nWhite examined Mr. Gates' performance for a specific day and put the data in tables which show the amount and type of news which appeared on the front pages and the total number of dispatches used. Mr. Gates admitted to preferring political news to other types of news and explained that he tries to avoid sensationalism and consistently leans more towards being \"conservative\" both in political views and in writing style. Observed patterns throughout the week also show that Mr. Gates leans away from stories filled with figures and statistics and prefers stories that contain more of a narrative. His notes and reasons for rejection can also show Mr. Gates' writing standard, using \"too vague,\" \"not interesting,\" and \"dull writing\" on a number of occasions. A question that White poses and says should be considered in this case study is, \"Does the category really enter into the choice?\"\n\nHe concludes that as Mr. Gates is representing \"gate keepers\" and wire editors as a whole, there doesn't seem to be a particular choice of news by categories. During the week the case study took place, however, there was a strong emphasis on Human Interest stories because there was a large appeal to a story regarding a Cardinal of the Catholic Church. Mr. Gates also concludes that the gate keeper's standards and taste should refer back to the audience and that they are the ones being served and pleased. His concluding remarks provide a great summary of the purpose and findings of the study. \"Through studying his overt reasons for rejecting news stories from the press associations we see how highly subjective, how based on the \"gate keeper's\" own set of experiences, attitudes and expectations the communication of \"news\" really is\" (390).\n\nLewin identified several parts of the gatekeeping process in his 1943 article:\n\n\nMore than fifty years after White's \"Mr. Gates\" study, in 2001, Pamela Shoemaker, Martin Eichholz, Eunyi Kim, and Brenda Wrigley studied the forces in news gatekeeping in relation to coverage of Congressional bills. More specifically, they were interested in two hypotheses: 1) the routine gatekeeping force of assessing a bill's newsworthiness will be related to how prominently a bill is covered. And 2) the individual journalist forces (education, political ideology, work experience, ethnicity, gender, voting behavior) will be related to how prominently a bill is covered. They also predicted that the newsworthiness of a bill would be more important than journalists' personal characteristics. Surveying both journalists (for their personal characteristics) and editors (for evaluating newsworthiness), Shoemaker and her colleagues found that only newsworthiness had a significant effect on the amount of coverage given to a bill, thus their first hypothesis was supported as well as the idea that newsworthiness would be more important than personal characteristics.\n\nWhile Shoemaker et al.'s study focused on traditional news rooms, Singer has been interested in how gatekeeping translates to how traditional newspapers use online tools. In both the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections, she studied how the Internet was changing the process for newspapers, contending that, \"the power of gatekeepers seems to diminish in a modern information society. The Internet defies the whole notion of a 'gate' and challenges the idea that journalists (or anyone else) can or should limit what passes through it\" (p. 265). In the study of the 2004 coverage, Singer posed the following research questions: 1) What did editors of Web sites affiliated with major newspapers see as their goals and their most noteworthy achievements in covering the 2004 political campaign and election? 2) To what extent did these editors relinquish their gatekeeping role by providing opportunities for users to provide or personalize content? And more broadly, 3) In what ways have the views of editors of Web sites affiliated with major newspapers changed since 2000?\n\nSinger found that the content which appears in online editions of newspapers mostly comes from content that appears in the print versions. However, editors were also very proud of the interactive tools on their websites that could not be in the paper. The goal of most editors was after all to inform the public. Further, journalists were beginning to take a step back from their traditional gatekeeping role such that many websites had sections in which journalists provided baseline information and users could manipulate according to their needs and interests like interactive maps, Electoral College scenarios, and ballot building tools based on zip codes. In 2000, editors were likely to boast about how quickly they could publish returns on election night. In 2004, this was no longer the case, as it was standard practice by then. Further, their stated goal for the 2008 election cycle was to let the audience guide the coverage.\n\nAlong with Web 2.0 environment, users have begun playing a greater role in producing and (re)distributing online news items via online social networks such as Twitter and Facebook. Shoemaker and Vos (2011) theorized such practice as \"audience gatekeeping\". According to them (2011), audience gatekeeping is the process in which users \"pass along already available news items and comment on them\" based on the user's own set of criteria about the newsworthiness\" (p. 113). Kwon et al. (2013) adapted the theory of audience gatekeeping to explore what channels are mainly adopted for Twitter audiences to filter and share news contents. The notion of audience gatekeeping consists with Goode's (2009) discussion on metajournalism, whereby users' role in reprocessing and rebroadcasting the existing online contents are as equally emphasized as users' original creation in nurturing citizen journalism as reshaping the existing hierarchy of journalism system. Kwon et al. (2013) also found that re-processed news items by user-generated content websites, or social media, are more frequently adopted by Twitter users than the direct news times from traditional mass media organizations, confirming the empowering role of ordinary online users in retelling and redistributing news agendas to networked publics.\n\nKarine Barzilai-Nahon has written a number of contemporary pieces on gatekeeping theories between disciplines. In 2008, she proposed a new way of looking at gatekeeping, merging the disciplines' of communication, information science, and management perspectives into a refined theory of gatekeeping. Traditional mass communication gatekeeping theory has focused on how we get news, however Barzilai-Nahon's approach applies to all information.\n\nBarzilai-Nahon also adds new terms and redefines old terms in the framework (pp. 1496 – 1497)\n\nThis updated look at gatekeeping also poses a number of classifications including the bases for gatekeeping, mechanisms used in network gatekeeping, and types of authority of network gatekeepers.\n\nAdditionally, Barzilai-Nahon introduces a typology for the gated. According to her approach, the gated can have four key attributes at different levels that determine how they can interact with the gate. These are (p. 1501):\n\n\nA typology of combinations of these characteristics then allows for evaluation of potential interactions between the gatekeeper and the gated based on the number and type of attributes an individual has. Her discussion about \"the gated\" resonates with audience gatekeeping in that both empowers the message recipients in the process of gatekeeping.\n\nJournalists rely on the five criteria when choosing a news story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe news criteria pressure journalists and news outlets to frequently publish new stories, in order to stay current on events. Reporters attend local events in order to get stories quickly and easily. When events are difficult to report on, journalists resort to interviews or experts of the event or field. The five criteria dictate which events are chosen and which events to spend money on to report. The size of a newspaper also dictates which stories to publish and which ones to skip. Once stories reach news outlets, editors must determine which stories to select. Editors do not spend much time choosing stories. An average editor must choose stories in seconds. Investigative or complex stories are covered by TV sources and radio. Those types of stories go towards television and radio because they have more time to dedicate to the stories. They can describe the event, background, and causes in depth. The size of the paper and the pressure editors have may cause bias in the audience's perspective. Stories containing the five criterion almost always make the front page of the news. The frequent representation of those types of stories often leads to skewness from the public.\n\nIt is harmful to content creativity since not all the information is disseminated. It is harmful because biases inevitably affect gatekeeping decisions. Life-decisions of the audience may be affected by what information is included or excluded.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3694654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3694654", "title": "Gestell", "text": "Gestell\n\nGestell (or sometimes Ge-stell) is a German word used by twentieth-century German philosopher Martin Heidegger to describe what lies behind or beneath modern technology. Heidegger introduced the term in 1954 in \"The Question Concerning Technology\", a text based on the lecture \"The Framework\" (\"Das Gestell\") first presented on December 1, 1949, in Bremen. It was derived from the root word \"stellen\", which means \"to put\" or \"to place\" and combined with the German prefix \"Ge-\", which denotes a form of \"gathering\" or \"collection\". The term gathers together all kinds of entities and orders them in a certain way. \n\nHeidegger applied the concept of \"Gestell\" to his exposition of the essence of technology. He concluded that technology is fundamentally Enframing (\"Gestell\").\nAs such, the essence of technology is \"Gestell\". Indeed, \"\"Gestell\", literally 'framing', is an all-encompassing view of technology, not as a means to an end, but rather a mode of human existence\". Such enframing pertains to the manner reality appears or unveils itself in the period of modern technology and people born into this \"mode of ordering\" are always embedded into the Gestell (enframing). \n\nIn defining the essence of technology as \"Gestell\", Heidegger indicated that all that has come to presence in the world has been enframed. Thus what is revealed in the world, what has shown itself as itself (the truth of itself) required first an Enframing, literally a way to exist in the world, to be able to be seen and understood. Concerning the essence of technology and how we see things in our technological age, the world has been framed as the \"standing-reserve.\" Heidegger writes,\n\nEnframing means the gathering together of that setting-upon which sets upon man, i.e., challenges him forth, to reveal the real, in the mode of ordering, as standing-reserve. Enframing means that way of revealing which holds sway in the essence of modern technology and which is itself nothing technological.\n\nFurthermore, Heidegger uses the word in a way that is uncommon by giving \"Gestell\" an active role. In ordinary usage the word would signify simply a display apparatus of some sort, like a book rack, or picture frame; but for Heidegger, \"Gestell\" is literally a challenging forth, or \"perform\"ative \"gathering together\", for the purpose of revealing or presentation. If applied to science and modern technology, \"standing reserve\" is active in the case of a river once it generates electricity or the earth if revealed as a coal-mining district or the soil as a mineral deposit. \n\nFor some scholars, Gestell effectively explains the violence of technology. This is attributed to Heidegger's explanation that, when Gestell holds sway, \"it drives out every other possibility of revealing\" and that it \"conceals that revealing which, in the sense of \"poiesis\", lets what presences come forth into appearance.\"\n\n"}

The complex is what has survived from the once flourishing town of Gremi and is located southwest of the present-day village of the same name in the Kvareli district, 175 kilometers east of Tbilisi, capital of Georgia. \nGremi was the capital of the Kingdom of Kakheti in the 16th and 17th centuries. Founded by Levan of Kakheti, it functioned as a lively trading town on the Silk Road and royal residence until being razed to the ground by the armies of Shah Abbas I of Persia in 1615. The town never regained its past prosperity and the kings of Kakheti transferred their capital to Telavi in the mid-17th century. There was big Armenian population. The Russian diplomat Fedor Volkonsky, who was here in the 17th century, said: \"Armenians have own church and market behind one was other church\". He also said about 10 Armenian churches near the palace of king\n\nThe town appears to have occupied the area of approximately 40 hectares and to have been composed of three principal parts – the Archangels’ Church complex, the royal residence and the commercial neighborhood. Systematic archaeological studies of the area guided by A. Mamulashvili and P. Zak’araia were carried out in 1939-1949 and 1963-1967, respectively. Since 2007, the monuments of Gremi have been proposed for inclusion into the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n\nThe Archangels’ Church complex is located on a hill and composed of the Church of the Archangels Michael and Gabriel itself, a three-story castle, a bell tower and a wine cellar (\"marani\"). It is encircled by a wall secured by embrasures, turrets and towers. Remains of the secret tunnel leading to the Ints’obi River have also survived.\n\nThe Church of the Archangels was constructed at the behest of King Levan of Kakheti (r. 1520–1574) in 1565 and frescoed by 1577. It is a cruciform domed church built chiefly of stone. Its design marries traditional Georgian masonry with a local interpretation of the contemporary Iranian architectural taste. The building has three entrances, one facing west, one facing to the south, and the third facing to the north. The interior is crowned with a dome supported by the corners of the sanctuary and two basic piers. The façade is divided into three arched sections. The dome sits on an arcaded drum which is punctured by eight windows.\n\nThe bell-tower also houses a museum where several archaeological artifacts and the 16th-century cannon are displayed. The walls are adorned with a series of portraits of the kings of Kakheti by the modern Georgian painter Levan Chogoshvili (1985).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30539125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30539125", "title": "Guerrero (ship)", "text": "Guerrero (ship)\n\nGuerrero was a Spanish slave ship which wrecked in 1827 on a reef near the Florida Keys with 561 Africans aboard. Forty-one of the Africans drowned in the wreck. \"Guerrero\" had been engaged in a battle with a British anti-slavery patrol ship, HMS \"Nimble\", stationed on the northern approaches to Cuba. \"Nimble\" also ran onto the reef, but was refloated and returned to service. The two ships were attended by wreckers, who rescued the Spanish crew and surviving Africans from their ship and helped refloat \"Nimble.\" Spanish crew members hijacked two of the wrecking vessels and took almost 400 Africans to Cuba, where they were sold as slaves. Most of the remaining Africans were eventually returned to Africa.\n\nThe history of the ship is unclear. Because the slave trade to Cuba was illegal in the 1820s, ships that successfully delivered a cargo of slaves from Africa to Cuba were often destroyed or registered under a new name to avoid confiscation by the Spanish authorities. The British Consul in Santiago, Cape Verde reported in 1827 that the ship then known as \"Guerrero\" was the former \"James Monroe\", which was launched in 1813 in New London, Connecticut, and had served as a privateer during the War of 1812. \"James Monroe\" made two trading voyages to France during the war, capturing a total of six British ships on those voyages. It made at least two more crossings to France after the end the war. Its later history is unclear, in part because a number of American ships were named for James Monroe after he became President of the United States in 1817.\n\nThe ship known in 1827 as \"Guerrero\" was heavily armed. She carried four long brass 12-pounder guns and ten iron 12-pounders, and carried a crew of 90 or more men. Such large, well-armed slave ships often engaged in piracy, robbing smaller ships of their cargoes, including slaves. Prior to 1826 the ship was known as \"San Jose\". In June 1826 a brig then known as \"Pepe\", likely the ship later known as \"Guerrero,\" sailed from Havana for Africa. A few days later a \"Spanish\" brig stopped and robbed a sloop on its way from Bermuda to Norfolk, Virginia. Late in July what probably was the same brig robbed two American ships anchored at Cape Mesurado in Liberia. Two British warships were dispatched to catch the pirate ship, now identified as \"Pepe\". The British ships caught up to \"Pepe\", but it managed to escape during a heavy rainstorm. \"Pepe\" loaded about 600 Africans at Gallinas (near the border between present day Sierra Leone and Liberia) and delivered about 570 of them to Cuba late in the year.\n\nOn 14 July 1827 \"Guerrero\" sailed from Havana for Africa. Her departure was noted (along with that of several other suspected slave ships) by British commissioners in Havana. About 700 Africans, some of whom may have been forcibly taken from other slave ships, were on \"Guerrero\" when it sailed from Africa for Cuba. On 19 December 1827 \"Guerrero\" was sailing south towards Cuba in the Florida Straits carrying 561 Africans who had survived the voyage when it was spotted by HMS \"Nimble\" near Orange Cay (on the Great Bahama Bank). \"Nimble\" was smaller and more lightly armed (crew of 56, with, by various reports, eight, five or just three guns) than \"Guerrero\". \"Nimble\" fired two shots to order the suspected slave ship to stop for inspection, but \"Guerrero\" ran, starting a five-hour chase during which the weather turned bad and night came on. As \"Nimble\" closed the distance between the ships they commenced firing at each other. The crew on the lightship \"Caesar\", stationed on Carysfort Reef near Key Largo, could see and hear the battle, which appeared to be about ten miles away.\n\nAfter a half-hour of battle \"Guerrero\" appeared to signal that it was surrendering, but then tried to run off. \"Nimble\" resumed the pursuit, even though the ships were entering shallower water. At about 7:30 PM \"Guerrero\" hit a reef while sailing at close to ten knots. The impact tore the hull open and toppled the masts. Forty-one of the Africans confined in the hold were drowned as \"Guerrero\" sank. \"Nimble\" tried to turn away, but five minutes later it also ran onto a reef. Although its crew managed to get \"Nimble\" off the reef, it drifted back onto the reef, and a receding tide left it there, about two-and-one-half miles (four km) from the wreck of \"Guerrero.\"\n\nThe next morning, 20 December 1827, wreckers on the schooner \"Thorn\" and sloop \"Surprize\", who had anchored overnight in Caesar's Creek, saw the two ships on the reef and went to their aid. They were soon joined by the fishing smack \"Florida\" and later by other wreckers. When the wreckers reached \"Guerrero\", her captain, Joze Gomez, requested that the American flag be raised on the wrecked ship, indicating that it was an American prize, and not taken by the British \"Nimble\". On the other hand, Lt. Edward Holland, commander of \"Nimble\", insisted that \"Guerrero\" had surrendered before the ships hit the reef, and was therefore a British prize.\n\n\"Nimble\" had lost its rudder, and had to be lightened and towed off the reef. The swivel gun was transferred to one of the wreckers and cannonballs and ballast thrown overboard. The crewmen and surviving Africans on \"Guerrero\" were loaded onto several of the wreckers. \"Florida\" took 20 of the Spanish crewmen and 142 Africans aboard and immediately departed for Key West. Before reaching there, however, the Spanish crewmen from \"Guerrero\" hijacked \"Florida\" and sailed it and the 142 Africans to Cuba. \"Thorn\" took 54 of the Spanish crewmen and 246 Africans, including all of the women. \"Thorn\" had not left by late afternoon, and Lt. Bolton requested that it anchor close to \"Nimble\" overnight so that the warship could help protect the wrecker from the Spanish crewmen on it. Even so, the Spanish crewmen hijacked \"Thorn\" from under the guns of \"Nimble\" and took it and the 246 Africans aboard to Cuba.\n\n\"Surprize\", which had taken on 12 of the Spanish crewmen and 122 Africans, anchored for the night near the wreck of \"Guerrero\" in the company of two other wreckers, the sloop \"Capital\" and schooner \"General Geddes.\" John Morrison, captain of \"General Geddes\", later testified that he was fearful of the intentions of the Spanish crewmen, and had ordered his own crew to arm themselves so that they could protect both \"Surprize\" and his ship from any attempt by the Spanish to seize them. The next morning \"Surprize\" approached \"Nimble\" and transferred ten of the Spanish crewmen to it (\"Nimble\" already had another ten Spanish crewmen aboard), leaving only two on \"Surprize\", and then sailed for Key West. \"Capital\" and \"General Geddes\" helped salvage the rudder from \"Guerrero\" and mount it on \"Nimble\". The three ships then sailed for Key West.\n\n\"Nimble\", \"Capital\" and \"General Geddes\" reached Key West on 24 December and \"Florida\" and \"Thorn\" returned from Cuba the next day, their crews having been released unharmed. One of the Africans on \"Surprize\" died before reaching Key West, so 121 were unloaded there. Lt. Holden claimed that the Africans were under his protection because \"Guerrero\" had surrendered to him. The Collector of Customs for the port claimed custody of the Africans because they had been landed in American territory after being shipwrecked. The wreckers claimed salvage on \"Nimble\" for helping to get it off the reef and replace the rudder. Lt. Holden refused to submit to the arbitration procedure established by Florida territorial law, which would have let a panel of local residents, almost all of whom had a financial stake in wrecking, decide how much in salvage fees were due the wreckers. \"Nimble\" left Key West without the Africans, and the wreckers remained unpaid. \"Nimble\" delivered the 20 Cuban crewmen it was holding to Havana to be dealt with by the British-Spanish Mixed Commission Court that dealt with Spanish slave-runners caught near Cuba.\n\nThe 121 Africans presented a problem to Key West, which had only some 420 residents. In response to a rumor that a ship was being prepared in Cuba to attack Key West and take the Africans, Key West prepared to defend itself. There were also attempts by Americans to take by force or by bribery part or all of the Africans. After seven weeks, in March 1828, the Africans were transferred to St. Augustine, and delivered into the custody of the U.S. Marshal for the Eastern District of Florida, Waters Smith. Only 114 reached St. Augustine. Six had died in Key West, and one was kept by the captain of the revenue cutter that escorted the ship carrying the Africans to St. Augustine.\n\nOne of the Africans, named Lewis, was not a captive, but had been hired as an interpreter by the captain of \"Guerrero\". Lewis had been to Havana on at least one earlier slave ship. He had also brought his son with him, and asked that he and his son be released to go to Havana so that he could collect his wages. Lewis was eventually released, but his son was not.\n\nAlthough he expected to be eventually reimbursed, Waters Smith had to pay for the care of the Africans from his own pocket. (In the end, Smith was reimbursed for only part of what he had spent, and he had to mortgage his home to cover the rest.) To partially cover his expenses, he hired the Africans out to plantation owners at two dollars per month each. Boys too young for field work were placed as servants in private homes. Several of the men were blind or sick, and could not be put to work. At this point the condition of the Africans rescued from \"Guerrero\" was indistinguishable from slavery. The Africans were in a legal limbo. There were laws covering Africans seized while being illegally imported into the United States, but they did not apply to Africans who entered the country accidentally. In April 1828 President John Quincy Adams requested Congress to pass a supplementary law dealing with the \"Guerrero\" Africans, but it failed to act. A year later, in March 1829, Congress appropriated funds to reimburse Waters Smith and transport the \"Guerrero\" Africans to Liberia.\n\nA ship to transport the Africans to Liberia was engaged in June, 1829, and Waters Smith was ordered to prepare the Africans for embarkation. There were delays when the ship had to be replaced, and the departure point for the Africans was moved from St. Augustine to Fernandina, Florida. Smith had problems gathering the Africans. He had rented 36 of the Africans to Zephaniah Kingsley and another 20 to Joseph Marion Hernández. When Smith called for the hired-out Africans to be returned to him so that they could be shipped to Africa, Kingsley and Hernandez refused to do so, based on an opinion by the Collector of Customs for St. Augustine that the Africans were free men and therefore Smith had no authority to hire them out as slaves or to remove them from the possession of Kingsley and Hernandez and order them sent to Africa. Smith was able to bring the Africans into Fernandina, \"[p]artly by force and partly by persuasion\". Hernández never paid any of the money he owed Smith for the 20 Africans he had rented. Smith also paid Seminoles to bring in some of the Africans that had run away from Kingsley's and Hernández' plantations. Smith felt that he had to stay on guard in Fernandina because he suspected that slave dealers were planning to steal some of the Africans to carry them away for sale as slaves.\n\nAfter further delays, 100 of the Africans were boarded on \"Washington's Barge\", which sailed on 30 September 1829. (Some of the Africans had died, and some were too ill to travel. Two boys were kept back because they had yaws.) On 31 December 1829 \"Washington's Barge\" arrived in Barbados, badly damaged and out of drinking water. Five of the \"Guerrero\" Africans had died since leaving Fernandina. The Africans were transferred to the brig \"Heroine\", which sailed on 16 January 1830 and arrived in Liberia 4 March 1830. They were settled in New Georgia, a town a few miles from Monrovia, where they joined people who had been recaptured from the slave ship \"Antelope\" by the U.S. Revenue Cutter \"Dallas\" in 1820 and sent to Liberia in 1827.\n\nArchaeologists have searched for the sites of the sunken \"Guerrero\" and grounding of \"Nimble\". One area of interest was the entrance to Turtle Harbor, four miles east of the northern end of Key Largo and three and a half miles north of the Carysfort Reef Light. Artifacts found in a search of the area from 2003 to 2006 did not specifically identify any ship. Swanson maintained that the wreck sites were likely further north, near Pacific Reef. One problem was that various accounts placed the wreck sites at six to ten miles from the Carysfort Reef lightship, but the position of that lightship is not well established (contemporary sources vary wildly, even putting the lightship inland). A documentary about the search for the \"Guerrero\" wreck site narrated by James Avery, \"The Guerrero Project\", was produced in 2004.\n\nIn August 2015 the Diving with a Purpose Underwater Archaeology Program in conjunction with the National Park Service and the National Association of Black Scuba Divers announced they believe the wreck has been located on the reef off the coast of Key Largo, Fl. Underwater excavations in 2010 and 2012 by the Mel Fisher Maritime Heritage Society and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration identified the wreck through a cologne bottle from the early 1800s, bone china, lead shot, blue-edged earthenware, metal rigging, copper fasteners, and wooden plank fragments recovered from the wreck site.\n\n\n"}

Wells helped to draft the Constitution of Puerto Rico and advised the Dominican Republic on proper election procedures for the Organization of American States. Additionally, Wells worked as international election observer in Honduras, Costa Rica, Bolivia and Nicaragua.\n\nWells was born in Macomb, Illinois, the son of Maurice Henry Wells and Dorcas H. Hart. His original immigrant ancestor was Thomas Welles (1590–1659), who arrived in Connecticut in 1637 and was the only man in Connecticut's history to hold all four top offices: governor, deputy governor, treasurer, and secretary. He is also a descendant of Hopkins L. Turney (October 3, 1797 – August 1, 1857) a Democratic U.S. Representative and United States Senator from Tennessee.\n\nHe received a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois, Phi Beta Kappa, and a master's degree at Louisiana State University.\n\nWells also enrolled at Yale University but withdrew in order to join the United States Navy in 1942 during World War II. He served as an intelligence officer in the South Pacific with the Seventh Fleet from 1942 to 1946. Following World War II, Wells returned to Yale University where he earned his doctorate in 1947. He taught at Yale as a professor until 1953. (An avid golfer, Wells helped pay for his Yale education by working as a golf pro in Litchfield, Connecticut).\n\nWells married Patricia Brown in 1950. The couple later moved to Mount Airy in Philadelphia and had six children.\n\nWells taught at the University of Puerto Rico from 1953 to 1956. He joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania in 1956 where he taught until his retirement in 1986. He was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship and took a leave of absence from Penn in order to teach in Costa Rica. Wells drove a Dodge van wife his and six children down the Pan-American Highway in order to reach San José, Costa Rica. The family arrived in San Jose on the same day that the Apollo 11 astronauts landed on the moon.\n\nHe was the author of several books on Latin American including \"The Modernization of Puerto Rico: A Political Study of Changing Values and Institutions\", which was published in 1969.\n\nWells was an outspoken critic of the United States' support of the El Salvadoran military during the Salvadoran Civil War of the 1980s. Wells was quoted in a 1981 interview, \"We are on the wrong side in El Salvador...We are trying to show the Soviets how tough we are . . . at the expense of the desperately poor in El Salvador.\"\n\nWells was also an active community activist in Philadelphia. He served as a consultant to then Philadelphia Mayor Richardson Dilworth on community relations. He also held a post of judge of elections in West Mount Airy from 1962 to 1964. Wells supported housing and neighborhood integration as president of the West Mount Airy Neighbors in the early 1960s. He also once organized a weekend for 200 families of United Nations delegates and employees. The families stayed for the weekend at the homes of local West Mount Airy residents.\n\nHenry Wells died of complications from Alzheimer's disease at his home in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 1, 2007. He was 92 years old. He was survived by his wife, four daughters, two sons, and ten grandchildren.\n"}

It contrasts with hesitation and modulation because, rather than not having the right words to say or choosing to avoid them, the speaker uses hypocorrection as a strategy.\n\nOriginally, hypocorrection or accented pronunciation of words may have arisen due to physical properties involved in sound production (such as Aerodynamics, Anatomy, Vocal Tract Shape) (page 259). However, intentional use of hypocorrection or affecting a, for instance, Southeastern US accent to sound less elitist. It involves \"...make-believe hesitations and colloquial language may work as affiliative strategies (softeners) etc.\". Over time, due to both physical features of voice production and affected accents to not sound overly sophisticated influenced local dialects.\n\nAnother strategy, hypocorrection (Maury-Rouan 1998) has similar interactive goals as it also works as a softener. Hypocorrection consists of an attempt to give one’s discourse a clumsy, colloquial, or even broken or dysfluent style, when introducing clever or innovating statements or ideas. By and large, hypocorrection allows the speaker, by toning down a potential flattering image of self, to avoid sounding pretentious or pedantic, thus reducing the risk of threat to recipient(s) face.\nMaury-Rouan's participants in the study:\n\nOriginal: \"The balance between East and West used to be very reassuring; we knew there was an East block”<br>\nHypocorrection: \"The balance between East and West sort of ah:::: t’was like very ah::::(1.65) reassuring + ya’ know + we knew + well there were ++ there was a We+East block\"\n\nExample by Charles Jones in Historical Linguistics:\n\n...distinctive vowel nasalization on vowels that used to stand next to nasal consonants maybe considerably greater in amplitude than ... when nasalization was a predictable phonetic feature.\n"}

It was crafted sometime in the mid to late 10th century in Constantinople. The box measures 48 centimeters by 35 centimeters and has a depth of 6 centimeters. This reliquary design was common in Byzantium beginning in the 9th century. The Limburg Staurotheke is currently housed in Germany in the Limburg an der Lahn.\n\nThe Limburg Staurotheke consists of two parts that were made at separate times. The removable, double-armed cross was made first and holds seven fragments of the True Cross in the middle of the cross where its main set of arms meets. The cross is made out of sycamore wood and is entirely covered in gilded silver and embellished with gemstones and pearls. Inscribed on the back of the cross is the following verse:\n\nThe two emperors mentioned in the inscription are Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos and Romanos II, his son. They ruled jointly from 945 to 959, meaning that the cross would have been constructed during their rule.\nThe box and its sliding, removable lid were made second and is designed to hold the cross reliquary in the center of the box. Surrounding the cross are ten enamel panels that depict angels wearing court outfits. Next to the angels are 10 more panels that each depict a pair of either cherubim or seraphim. The panels depicting the cherubim and seraphim are the containers that hold ten relics and each compartment has an inscription that identifies the relic housed inside. Six relics are Passion relics and are ascribed to Christ, three to the Virgin Mary, and one to John the Baptist. The relics in the compartments of the theke are:\n\nThe lid of the box, like the cross and inner compartments of the theke, is covered in gilded silver and lavishly decorated with gemstones. It features nine enamel panels that portray the Deesis, a scene that depicts Christ in a throne, accompanied by the Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist and surrounded by angels. On the lid of the Limburg Staurotheke, Christ is seen in the middle panel, with John the Baptist to his left and the Virgin Mary to his right. The archangels Gabriel and Michael stand next to John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary. The top and bottom panels portray the twelve Apostles. On an outer border framing the panels are the busts of eight unidentified figures, though they are likely images of four military saints and four important church leaders. The theke itself features an inscription on the outer rim that states:\n\nThe inscription reveals that Basil Lekapenos was the benefactor of the staurotheke. Basil was the bastard son of Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos and was made a eunuch likely as a child. He would become a powerful figure in the imperial court. Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas gave him the title of \"proedros\" in 963. The theke was likely made between 963 and 985, when Basil was exiled from the imperial court.\n"}

This reference model is defined by recommendation CCSDS 650.0-B-2 of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems; this text is identical to ISO 14721:2012. The CCSDS's purview is space agencies, but the OAIS model it developed has proved useful to a wide variety of other organizations and institutions with digital archiving needs.\n\nThe information being maintained has been deemed to need \"long term preservation\", even if the OAIS itself is not permanent. \"Long term\" is long enough to be concerned with the impacts of changing technologies, including support for new media and data formats, or with a changing user community. \"Long term\" may extend indefinitely. In this reference model there is a particular focus on digital information, both as the primary forms of information held and as supporting information for both digitally and physically archived materials. Therefore, the model accommodates information that is inherently non-digital (e.g., a physical sample), but the modeling and preservation of such information is not addressed in detail. As strictly a conceptual framework, the OAIS model does not require the use of any particular computing platform, system environment, system design paradigm, system development methodology, database management system, database design paradigm, data definition language, command language, system interface, user interface, technology, or media for an archive to be compliant. Its aim is to set the standard for the activities that are involved in preserving a digital archive rather than the method for carrying out those activities.\n\nThe acronym OAIS should not be confused with OAI, which is the Open Archives Initiative.\n\nThe reference model:\n\n\nThe reference model (ISO 14721:2003) includes the following responsibilities that an OAIS archive must abide by:\n\nThe OAIS environment involves the interaction of four entities: producers of information, consumers of information (or the Designated Community), management, and the archive itself. The management component of the OAIS environment is not an entity that carries out day-to-day maintenance of an archive but a person or group that sets policies for the content contained in the archive.\n\nThe OAIS model also defines an information model. Physical or digital items which contain information are known as data objects. Members of the Designated Community for an archive should be able to interpret and understand the information contained in a data object either because of their established knowledge base or with the assistance of supplementary \"representation information\" that is included with the data object.\n\nAn information package includes the following information objects:\nThere are three types of information package in the OAIS reference model: \nThese three information packages may or may not be identical to each other.\n\nThere are six functional entities in an OAIS:\n\nAlthough originally developed by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems, a body dedicated to overseeing space agencies, as digital preservation has become a discipline unto itself, the OAIS has become the standard model for digital preservation systems at many institutions and organizations. OAIS-compliance has been a stated fundamental design requirement for major digital preservation and repository development efforts at the National Archives and Records Administration, Library of Congress, British Library, Bibliothèque nationale de France, National Library of the Netherlands, the Digital Curation Centre in the UK, OCLC (the Online Computer Library Center), the JSTOR (Journal Storage) scholarly journal archive, as well as several university library systems. Centre of Excellence for Digital Preservation, C-DAC, India has implemented OAIS for National Cultural Audiovisual Archive (NCAA) which has been certified as Trusted Digital Repository as per ISO 16363: 2012 during November 2017.

{"id": "35138426", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35138426", "title": "Orthographic transcription", "text": "Orthographic transcription\n\nOrthographic transcription is a transcription method that employs the standard spelling system of each target language.\n\nExamples of orthographic transcription are \"Pushkin\" and \"Pouchkine\", respectively the English and French orthographic transcriptions of the surname \"Пу́шкин\" in the name Алекса́ндр Пу́шкин (Alexander Pushkin). Thus, each target language (English and French) transcribes the surname according to its own orthography.\n\nContrast with phonetic transcription, phonemic orthography, transliteration, and translation.\n\nTranscription as a mapping from sound to script must be distinguished from transliteration, which creates a mapping from one script to another that is designed to match the original script as directly as possible. Standard transcription schemes for linguistic purposes include the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), and its ASCII equivalent, SAMPA. See also phonetic transcription. Transcription is often confused with transliteration, perhaps due to a common journalistic practice of mixing elements of both in rendering foreign names. The resulting practical transcription is a hybrid that is called both \"transcription\" and \"transliteration\" by the general public.\n\nThe table below shows examples of phonetic transcription of the name of the former Russian president known in English as Boris Yeltsin, followed by accepted hybrid forms in various languages. English speakers will pronounce \"Boris\" differently from the original Russian, so it is a transliteration rather than a transcription in the strict sense.\n\nThe same words are likely to be transcribed differently under different systems. For example, the Mandarin Chinese name for the capital of the People's Republic of China is \"Beijing\" using the commonly used contemporary system Hànyǔ Pīnyīn, but in the historically significant Wade–Giles system, it is written \"Pei-Ching\".\n\nPractical transcription can be done into a non-alphabetic language too. For example, in a Hong Kong newspaper, George Bush's name is transliterated into two Chinese characters that sound like \"Bou-sū\" (布殊) by using the characters that mean \"cloth\" and \"special\". Similarly, many words from English and other Western European languages are borrowed in Japanese and are transcribed using Katakana, one of the Japanese syllabaries.\n\nAfter transcribing a word from one language to the script of another language:\n\nThis is especially evident for Greek loanwords and proper names. Greek words were historically first transcribed to Latin (according to their old pronunciations), and then loaned into other languages, and finally the loanword has developed according to the rules of the target language. For example, \"Aristotle\" is the currently used English form of the name of the philosopher whose name in Greek is spelled  ̓Aριστoτέλης (\"Aristotélēs\"), which was transcribed to Latin \"Aristoteles\", from where it was loaned into other languages and followed their linguistic development. (In \"classical\" Greek of Aristotle's time, lower-case letters were not used, and the name was spelled ΑΡΙΣΤΟΤΕΛΗΣ.)\n\n\"Pliocene\", a much more recent word, comes from the Greek words πλείων (\"pleiôn\", \"more\") and καινóς (\"kainós\", \"new\"), which were first transcribed (Latinised) to \"plion\" and \"caenus\" and then loaned into other languages.\n\nWhen this process continues over several languages, it may fail miserably to convey the original pronunciation. One ancient example is the Sanskrit word \"dhyāna\" (\"contemplation\", \"meditation\") which was transcribed into the Chinese word \"ch'anna\" through Buddhist scriptures; next shortened into \"ch'an\". \"Ch'an\" (禪), pronounced \"zen\" in Japanese, used as the name of the Buddhist sect of \"Chan\" (Zen Buddhism), was transcribed from Japanese (ゼン \"zen\") to \"zen\" in English. \"Dhyāna\" to \"zen\" is quite a change.\n\nAnother issue is any subsequent change in \"preferred\" transcription. For instance, the word describing a philosophy or religion in China was popularized in English as \"Tao\" and given the termination \"-ism\" to produce an English word \"Taoism\". That transcription reflects the Wade–Giles system. More recent Pinyin transliterations produce \"Dao\" and \"Daoism\".\n\n"}

A group of eleven artifacts found there have an average age of 15,405 to 14,146 calendar years Before Present (12,425 ± 32 C years BP). The earliest dates for artifacts recovered from the site are between 1,000 and 1,500 years before the advent of the Clovis culture. The site is the first pre-Clovis site discovered in southeastern North America. Page-Ladson is about 60 m by 45 m wide and 10 m deep. Its significance is that the dating of the artifacts places humans at the location more than 1,500 years prior to earlier evidence and challenges theories that humans quickly decimated large game populations in the area once they arrived.\n\nAt the height of the last ice age (the Wisconsin glaciation), the sea level was up to 100 meters lower than at present. Much more land was above the water along the coast, which was extended much farther to the west. Most of Florida is a thick limestone platform, with typical Karst topography. As limestone is porous, salt water penetrates the lower part of the Florida platform, and fresh water floats on top of the salt water. With the lowered sea level of the ice age, the fresh water table in Florida also was lowered, leaving most of Florida much drier than it is at present. The only reliable sources of fresh water at elevations that are currently above sea level were sinkholes and the deeper parts of river beds. The Page-Ladson site was one of those watering holes, located in a ravine that is now the bed of the river. Before it was inundated by the Aucilla river, Page-Ladson was a sinkhole containing a small pond within it. \n\nThe lower part of the Aucilla River (from the Cody Scarp to the Gulf of Mexico) crosses the Woodville Karst Plain, which consists of a thin layer of sand over limestone bedrock. Much of the flow of the Aucilla River has been captured by an underground drainage system created by karst processes. Sections of the river are entirely underground, surfacing for short stretches and then disappearing again. The Page-Ladson site is located in one of the above ground sections, known as Half-Mile Run (although it is closer to one mile long). Other sites on the Aucilla River also are yielding paleontological and archaeological finds, all as part of a long-running Aucilla River Prehistory Project.\n\nStarting in 1959, Dick Ohmes and other scuba divers began retrieving artifacts and Pleistocene animal bones bearing butcher marks from the lower reaches of the Aucilla River. A team led by archaeologist James Dunbar and paleontologist S. David Webb began a survey of Half-Mile Run in 1983. A former U.S. Navy Seal, Buddy Page, showed them a site where he had found elephant bones. A test pit yielded elephant bones, bone tools, and chips from tool making. Radiocarbon dating of organic material from the pit yielded dates from 13,000 to 11,700 years Before Present. The owners of the land surrounding Half-Mile Run, the Ladson family, granted permission to the team to access and camp along Half-Mile Run. Therefore, the site was named Page-Ladson.\n\nExcavation of the Page-Ladson site spanned the period from 1983 until 1997. As the project progressed, the team developed new methods of recording the stratigraphic placement of all material in an underwater environment. This excavation yielded eight lithic artifacts associated with mastodon butchering. This excavation dated the artifacts to approximately 14,400 BP, confirming that the Page-Ladson site was a Pre-Clovis site and the oldest site east of the Mississippi River.\n\nIn 2012, archaeological excavation at Page-Ladson resumed, following in the footsteps of the discovery of the site by James Dunbar and S. David Webb. These excavations continued until 2014. This excavation yielded six lithic artifacts (bifaces and flakes) made from local coastal plain chert from layers dating before Clovis. This excavation dated the site to approximately 14,200 to 14,550 BP, reaffirming the earlier dating from the previous excavation.\n\nThe lowest strata in Page-Ladson is late Pleistocene. It includes mastodon, mammoth, horse, ground sloth, palaeolama bones, and \"straw mats\" of chopped vegetation (leaves, bark, and wood) of relatively uniform length.The length of the chopped vegetation is consistent with the spacing between cusps on mastodon teeth, and the \"straw mats\" have been interpreted as equivalent to the layers of trampled elephant dung found around water holes in Africa. Elephant steroids have been identified in the \"digesta\" deposits at Page-Ladson and Latvis-Simpson (a 32,000-year-old mastodon site farther south in the Aucilla). Some of the bones from this level show apparently human-made cut marks, particularly a complete mastodon tusk. Ivory spear points (often called \"foreshafts\") are found more frequently in the Aucilla River than from a combination of all other early sites in North America. Samples from the \"straw mat\" level have yielded radiocarbon dates from 13,130 +/- 200 to 11,770 +/- 90 years Before Present. The \"straw mat\" level is covered by a layer of mud that did not contain any bones of extinct animals.\n\nIn 1996 an Early Archaic Bolen habitation level was found. At least three hearths were identified along with various stone points, scrapers, adzes, and gouges that were found, as well as antler points used to press flakes off the stone tools. Three wooden stakes were found upright in the ground, and a cypress log that had been burned on the top side and hollowed out. Radiocarbon dating yielded dates approximately 10,000 years Before Present. The site was well preserved because it had been flooded by a rise in the river level within a hundred years after the site had been occupied.\n\nUnderwater archaeologists and other researchers reexamining the Page-Ladson site have shown that some Late Pleistocene human populations provisioned themselves with mastodons that were either butchered or scavenged 14,450 years ago (~14,550 cal yr B.P.) , about 2000 years before large mammal extinction. Prior to this determination, evidence of human scavenging or butchering of mastodons was deemed ambiguous.\n\n\"The new discoveries at Page-Ladson show that people were living in the Gulf Coast area much earlier than believed, The stone tools and faunal remains at the site show that at 14,550 years ago, people knew how to find game, fresh water and material for making tools. These people were well-adapted to this environment. The site is a slam-dunk pre-Clovis site with unequivocal artifacts, clear stratigraphy and thorough dating\" (Phys.org).\n\n\n"}

United States and Okanogan, Methow, San Poelis, Nespelem, Colville, and Lake Indian Tribes v. United States), 279 U.S. 655 (1929), was a 1929 United States Supreme Court decision which interpreted the Constitutional provisions regarding the pocket veto. \n\nAccording to Article I of the US Constitution, a bill that the President has not signed and not vetoed becomes law ten days after being sent to the President (not including Sundays) \"unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.\"\n\nThe action of the President allowing a bill to expire without signing it after the adjournment of Congress is known as a pocket veto. The pocket veto had been used by Presidents starting with James Madison. \n\nIn 1926, the United States Congress passed Senate Bill 3185, allowing American Indians in Washington State to sue for damages from the loss of their tribal lands. On June 24, 1926, the bill was sent to President Calvin Coolidge for him to sign or veto. Congress adjourned for the summer on July 3. After July 6, the tenth day after the bill's passage, the law passed without a presidential signature or veto. \n\nSeveral Indian tribes (the Okanogan, Methow, Sanpoil, Nespelem, Colville, and the Lake Indian Tribes) filed suit in the United States Court of Claims, which ruled that their case had no legal merit. The Indian tribes appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case. Arguing on behalf of the United States, U.S. Attorney General William D. Mitchell argued that the pocket veto was a long-established practice that had been used to decide many important cases. The case was argued on March 11, 1929 and was decided on May 27, 1929.\n\nThe case hinged on the definition of \"adjournment,\" in Article I.\n\nIn a 9–0 decision, the court affirmed the lower court's ruling. The decision, written by Justice Edward Terry Sanford, noted that adjournment should be interpreted broadly, to mean any cessation of congressional legislative activity. \n\nThe court revisited the issue of pocket vetos in .\n\n\n"}

Other traditions hold he is buried in the Cathedral of Lucca.\n\nThe history of this church is linked to sant'Agnello. Agnello was a 6th-century Neapolitan bishop, who defended the city against the besieging Lombards. Supposedly the church had been founded and devoted to the Virgin, by Agnello's parents. Recent studies have shown that the church was built atop an Ancient Roman Acropolis from the 4th century. When Sant'Agnello died, the church's name was changed to \"Santa Maria dei Sette Cieli\" (of the Seven Heavens). In the 9th century, Bishop Athanasius of Naples built a new religious building and dedicated to the abbot Saint Agnello and placed his relics in the church. During the Middle Ages, the cult of Sant'Agnello became increasingly important and the end of the 13th century till 1517, the church was under the direction of a rector, which from there on was a priest of the order of Canons Regular of the Lateran Congregation of the Most Holy Savior .\n\nFrom 1510 to 1600, the church rebuilt and enlarged by the archbishop Giovanni Maria Poderico. The transept, previously the church of \"Santa Maria Intercede\" was reconstructed as part of this church in 1517 and work inside continued on till the 18th century. The main altar by Girolamo Santacroce, had additions by Giovanni Battista Pandullo. Vincenzo Martino redid the pavement.\n\nOn August 7, 1809, the monastic order in charge of the church was suppressed, and on January 12, 1809, the monastery was sold by the Minister of Finance to a private citizen Cosimo d'Orazio. However, by 1856, the Ministry of the Interior was in charge of the maintenance, and in 1903 had planned demolition of both the church and monastery, but the plan was never implemented. By 1913, the parish was transferred to the nearby church of Santa Maria di Costantinopoli due to the precarious state of the structure. The second world war added damage. In 1962, during reconstruction the remains of the ancient acropolis were found. Vandalism, earthquakes, and decay have contributed to its poor state of conservation. In 2011, after a long restoration, the church has reopened.\n\nThe church still retains medieval traces in bas reliefs. The paintings moved here are of uncertain attribution.

{"id": "25441651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25441651", "title": "Shrew (stock character)", "text": "Shrew (stock character)\n\nThe shrew – an unpleasant, ill-tempered woman characterised by scolding, nagging, and aggression – is a comedic, stock character in literature and folklore, both Western and Eastern. The best-known work with this theme is probably Shakespeare's play \"The Taming of the Shrew\". The figure represents insubordinate female behaviour in a marital system of polarised gender roles, that is male-dominated in a moral hierarchy.\n\nIn 30 cultural groups in the middle 20th century, the folklorist Jan Harold Brunvand collected over 400 literary and oral version of shrew stories, in Europe alone. This stereotype or cliché was common in early to mid-20th century films, and retains some present-day currency, often shifted somewhat toward the virtues of the stock female character of the heroic virago.\n\nAs a reference to actual women, rather than the stock character, \"shrew\" is considered old-fashioned, and the synonym \"scold\" (as a noun) is archaic. More modern, figurative labels include \"battle-axe\" and \"dragon lady\"; more literary alternatives (all deriving from mythological names) are \"termagant\", \"harpy\", and \"fury\". The term \"shrew\" is still used to describe the stock character in fiction and folk storytelling. None of these terms are usually applied to males in Modern English.\n\n\"Shrew\" derives from Middle English ' for 'evil or scolding person', used since at least the 11th century, in turn from Old English ' or \"\", 'shrew' (animal); cognates in other Germanic languages have divergent meanings, including 'fox', 'dwarf', 'old man', and 'devil'. The modern spelling dates to the 14th century. Historically the animals called shrews were superstitiously feared, falsely believed to have a venomous bite and to behave aggressively and with cruelty, leading to the now-obsolete word \"beshrew\", 'to curse or invoke evil upon'.\n\nBeginning in the mid-13th century, following on the belief that the animals could exert a wicked influence on humans exposed to them, the term was applied metaphorically to a person of either sex thought to have a similar disposition, but by the 14th century, it was applied to women alone. This also led to a now obsolete verb usage, \"to shrew\" meaning 'to scold'.\nIn Elizabethan England, \"shrew\" was widely used to refer to women and wives who did not fit into the social role that was expected of them. In William Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\", Katherina \"has a scolding, shrewish tongue,\" thus prompting Petruchio to try and tame her.\n\nBy the middle 16th century, the opposing extremes of wifely personality traits were contrasted as \"shrew\" vs. \"sheep\". The earliest known formal definition of \"shrew\" as applied to people is Samuel Johnson's, in the 1755 \"A Dictionary of the English Language\": \"peevish, malignant, clamorous, spiteful, vexatious, turbulent woman\". He described the use of the word in reference to males as \"ancient\", but also quoted Shakespeare using it to satirise a man by likening him to the shrewish woman central to his play: \"By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.\" (\"Cf.\" modern use toward men of other female-targeted slurs like \"bitch\".)\n\nAs a synonym for the shrew in literature and theatre, the word \"termagant\" derives from the name Termagant, an invented, mock-Muslim, male deity used in mediaeval mystery plays, characterised as violent and overbearing. Termagant features in many period works of the 11th through 15th centuries, from \"The Song of Roland\" to Chaucer's \"Canterbury Tales\" (in \"The Tale of Sir Thopas\").\n\nThe name was genericised into a term referring to male characters with ranting, bullying personalities. In the 16th century, Shakespeare used the word in this generic, masculine sense in \"Henry IV\", Part I (as an adjective), and in its original proper name sense in \"Hamlet\". Such characters usually wore long gowns that gave them a feminine appearance in an era when female characters were played by men or boys, and were dressed similarly. This led the gradual shift in meaning, to refer exclusively to an overbearing, turbulent, quarrelsome, even brawling woman, which was a well established usage by the late 17th century. Female characters actually named Termagant appear in works including Thomas Shadwell's play \"The Squire of Alsatia\" (1688), and Arthur Murphy's play \"The Upholsterer\" (1758), while Washington Irving's \"Rip Van Winkle\" (1819) uses the word generically, to refer to the main character's wife.\n\nThe similar term \"harridan\", widely also considered a synonym of \"shrew\", originated as a late 17th-century slang term for 'aging prostitute' (probably from 16th-century French \"\", 'old horse', in metaphor a 'gaunt, ill-favoured woman'). It has taken on the meaning of scolding, nagging, bossy, belligerent woman, especially an older one, and is not tied to literary context.\n\nAnother word with essentially the same meaning, and applying only to women since around 1300, is the noun \"scold\" (later replaced with \"scolder\", as \"scold\" became a verb toward the late 14th century). It dates more gender-neutrally to Middle English, ca. 1150–1200, as ' or ' (unrelated to the 'burn' sense, from Old French), and probably derives from Old Norse \"\", 'a skald', i.e. poet. The skalds, like the bards, were feared for their panegyric satire, and this may explain the connection to verbal abusiveness.\n\nJohnson's 18th century definition was: \"A clamourous, rude, mean, low, foul-mouthed woman\", suggesting a level of vulgarity and a class distinction from the more generalised \"shrew\", but this nuance has been lost. In Johnson's time, the word formed part of a legal term, \"common scold\" which referred to rude and brawling women . To the extent the noun form retains any currency, some dictionaries observe that it can (unusually) be applied to males, a recent re-development. \"Scold\", in its heyday, was not particularly limited to literary or theatrical contexts.\n\nA common central theme of such literature and folktales is the often forceful \"taming\" of shrewish wives by their husbands. Arising in folklore, in which community story-telling can have functions of moral censorship or suasion, it has served to affirm traditional values and moral authority regarding polarised gender roles, and to address social unease about female behavior in marriage.\n\nThis basic plot structure typically involves a series of recurring motifs: A man, often young and penniless, marries a woman with shrewish or other negative qualities (laziness, etc.), for her dowry or other reasons unrelated to love, despite another trying to talk him out of it. She may have a more docile but unavailable younger sister, for contrast, and/or an even more shrewish mother.\n\nThe taming process begins immediately after the marriage, and does not last long, sometimes only the wedding night itself. It involves denial of intimacy by the husband to the bride, and often also has several other features, including coercion (e.g., by violence, sleep deprivation, and/or starvation) to induce submission, and psychological manipulation (e.g. abuse of animals, usually cats, in front of the wife). Capitulation by the \"shrew\" happens suddenly, she transforms into a \"model\" wife, and the couple live happily ever after.\n\nA variant suggests that the taming must be done early: The one who had tried to talk the young man out of the marriage (often the bride's own father) sees that it worked on the bride, and tries it on his own wife unsuccessfully because she already knows he is meek. Many of these elements, including denial of food (through trickery) and psychological manipulation (without animal abuse), were reused by William Shakespeare in his play \"The Taming of the Shrew\", which closes with the reformed shrew giving a monologue on why wives should always obey their husbands.\n\nThis overall plot structure was retained in various works of silent-era and post-Second World War cinema.\n\nElements of the shrew-taming plot are still used today, though with less patriarchal messages since the rise of feminism. \"The Taming of the Shrew\" has itself led to various modern, loose adaptations to current societal views in differing Western and Eastern industrialised societies, while retaining the stock character and the underlying theme of consequences of female disagreeableness, but often giving the \"shrew\" much more agency, and portraying some \"shrewish\" traits in a positive light, blending with the stock character of the virago.\n\nSome of these include: \"Frivolous Wife\", a 2008 South Korean film, in which the \"shrew\" attempts to change herself to become better accepted by her inlaws; \"ShakespeaRe-Told: The Taming of the Shrew\", a 2005 British film, in which a politician seeks to reform her Public relations image as an abrasive woman by getting married, but finds this challenging; \"Deliver Us from Eva\", a 2003 American romantic comedy film, in which the boyfriends of three young sisters whose relationships are being micro-managed by an elder, troublesome fourth sister, hire a pick-up artist to seduce this \"shrew\" and get them out of their lives, but he falls in love with her despite her ways not changing permanently.\n\nIn \"10 Things I Hate About You\", a 1999 American teen romantic comedy, in which high school students play matchmaker with a \"shrew\" and her cantankerous male counterpart, while themes of family reconciliation and teen-sex-related psychological angst are explored. It was remade as a 2009 TV series, in which the \"shrew\" character is redeveloped into a serious-attitude activist. In an uncommon gender-role reversal, the 1980 Italian film \"Il Bisbetico Domato\" (\"The Taming of the Scoundrel\") features a macho and grumpy but successful male farmer, known for antisocially driving women away, who is eventually won over by an earnest young lady, aided by the farmer's housekeeper who has long been trying to find a bride for the loner.\n\nBeing a \"common scold\" was once a petty criminal offense in the early modern law of England and Wales and of colonial New England, during the 16th through 18th centuries. Punishments varied by region, but were usually meant to humiliate the guilty party. They included the imposition of the ducking stool, pillory, jougs, a shrew's fiddle, or a scold's bridle. \"Scold\" or \"shrew\" was a term which could be applied with different degrees of reprobation, and one early modern proverb allowed that \"a shrew profitable may serve a man reasonable\".\n\n"}

Each 36-square-mile (~93 km) township is divided into 36 one-square-mile (~2.6 km) sections, that can be further subdivided for sale, and each section covers a nominal . The townships are referenced by a numbering system that locates the township in relation to a principal meridian (north-south) and a base line (east-west). For example, Township 2 North, Range 4 East is the 4th township east of the principal meridian and the 2nd township north of the base line. Township (exterior) lines were originally surveyed and platted by the US General Land Office using contracted private survey crews. Later survey crews subdivided the townships into sections (interior) lines. Virtually all lands covered by this system were sold according to these boundaries. They are marked on the U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps.\n\nPrior to standardization, some of the Ohio Lands (the United States Military District, the Firelands and the Connecticut Western Reserve) were surveyed into townships of on each side. These are often known as Congressional Townships.\n\nSections are divided into quarter-sections of each and quarter-quarter sections of each. In the Homestead Act of 1862, one quarter-section of land was the amount allocated to each settler. Stemming from this are the idiomatic expressions, \"the lower 40\", which is the 40 acres on a settler's land that is lowest in elevation, in the direction towards which water drains toward a stream, and the \"back forty\", the portion farthest from the settler's dwelling.\n\nSurvey townships are distinct from civil townships. A survey township is used to establish boundaries for land ownership. A civil township is a form of local government. In states with civil townships, the boundaries of survey townships are often coterminous with civil townships. County lines, especially in western States, usually follow township lines, leading to the large number of rectangular counties in the West, which are agglomerations of survey townships.\n\nIn western Canada, the Dominion Land Survey adopted a similar format for survey townships, which do not form administrative units. These townships also have the area of 36 square miles (six miles by six miles).\n\n"}

{"id": "42612939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42612939", "title": "United Arab Emirates Legal Process", "text": "United Arab Emirates Legal Process\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is a middle-eastern country, located at the end of the Arabian Peninsula on the Persian Gulf, consisting of seven emirates known as Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain, Ras al-Khaimah and Fujairah. Each emirate is governed by an emir who jointly forms the Federal Supreme Council (FSC). The Federal System of government includes the Supreme Council, Cabinet, Council of Ministers, parliamentary body, Federal National Council and independent judiciary. The Federal Supreme Council is the highest constitutional authority that has legislative and executive powers with the ability to ratify federal laws, decrees, and plans general policies. Its jurisdictions are derived from French, Roman, Egyptian and Islamic law.\n\nThere are three main branches of the court structure: civil, criminal, and sharia or Islamic (1) (the precepts are set forth in the Quranic verses and example set by the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Sunnah). (2) Sharia or Islamic courts work alongside the civil and criminal courts. The responsibilities include civil matters between Muslims. Non-Muslims will not appear before a Sharia court in any matter due to the differences in religious beliefs. (3) Sharia or Islamic courts have the exclusive jurisdiction over family disputes divorce, inheritance, child custody, child abuse, and guardianship of minors. (3) However, at the federal level the Sharia court may hear appeals of criminal cases including rape, robbery, and driving under the influence of alcohol. (3)\nDubai is its own sovereign nation with its own federal judicial system with separate court systems that are not subjected to the federal Supreme Court. Dubai's court structure consists of:\n\n\nCriminal actions commence with a police investigation which is transferred to the prosecutor's office within 48 hours of filing a complaint. The prosecutor will then hear and document statements from witnesses to determine if charges will be pressed or dropped, which must be completed 14 days from receiving the case from the police. Once the prosecutor has decided if charges will be pressed, the parties can proceed in hiring an attorney. All attorneys must be licensed to practice law and must be approved by an official deed notarized by a notary public to try the case. (3)\n\nUnder the United Arab Emirates constitution all defendants are innocent until proven guilty. All trials are public except for national security cases trials that the honoring judge can rule to be conducted in privates if any evidence, testimonies or results are detrimental to societal morality. (4) Being that majority of the trials are public the emirs decided on having no juries in place in the courtroom. Also, all proceedings are delivered in the native language. Except the sentencing portion, translators are available for those who are not fluent in Arabic. For all indignant persons who are charged with felonies punishable by 3–15 years with no attorney, may have counsel provided for them upon the governments discretion. (4) Unlike the United States court system, the UAE prosecutors and defense lawyers have the ability to withhold any investigation from each other involving the case. (4) After, deliberations have been made of indictments, detainees may be released on bail informally. Authorities will accept a cash deposit, passport or an unsecured personal guarantee statement signed by a third party as a form of payment. Diya or blood money also qualifies as debt to a crime committed.\n\nIf one causes the death or injury of another person accidentally or intentionally he or she must pay the victim's family, what is known as diya or \"blood money\". It is a means of compensation to the loss or harm for the loved ones. The payment of diya protects the rights of the family in the event of further threats from any accomplices or known associates of the defendant. Diya is only payable if the defendant is found guilty under the criminal procedure or legally responsible for committing the crime. (5) However, if the defendant is found defending themselves, family, or property, diya will not be paid. Males rate of diya is Dh 200,000 (approx. US$54,450) and Dh 100,000 (approx. US$27,225) for females regardless of religion or nationality. (5)\n\nSection 2 A of the United Arab Emirates constitution provides freedom of speech and press. However, the law prohibits criticism and slander of public officials that may create or encourage social uproar. (4) Journalists undergo strict boundaries implemented from the government. A variety of information can be published and distributed without the content being harmful or insulting to others. All sources must be reliable and will not be published until a full investigation has been performed to phish out any fabricated information. (6) Writers have the full right to document and publish info gathered from the courtroom due to trials being open to the public (judges can ask for privacy). Writers are prohibited from publishing the names of the accused, victims, or witnesses. (6)\n\nWomen in the UAE have progressed through the years with rights that they haven’t had prior to the declaration. However, many are concerned with how women are treated in this country. In marriage, the women are bound by a marital contract that clearly states that she is to abide by her husband, take care of home and the children. If the women disobeys or neglect her duties as a wife, by law the husband has the right to use physical means including violence to correct her disdaining acts. (4) Nevertheless, some domestic abuse cases can be filed as an assault without the intent to kill that is punishable by 10 years in prison of death results, 7 years for permanent disability, or 1 year for temporary injury. (4) Rape in the UAE is not tolerated and is punishable by immediate death. However, many women do not report being raped because they could be accused of adultery which results in flogging or death by stoning and brings shame to the family. (7) Divorce is rare in the UAE due to the stipulations that derive from it. Article 110 of the Personal Status Code states, women can request to be divorced with the exception that she surrenders all of her finances; otherwise known as the \"khul\" divorce procedure. (7) If the divorce is processed, the custody of the children is determined. Women are considered to be physical guardians and only have the right to custody up to the age of 13 for girls and 10 for boys. Once that age has been reached the Sharia courts can reassess for further custody. If the woman decides to remarry she automatically forfeits her rights of custody for her children from the previous marriage. (7)\n\nLike the women if minors disobey or act out, the male has the right to utilize corporal punishment. Criminal responsibility begins at age seven. (8) Sharia principles permit corporal punishment of young children including flogging, amputation, and retaliation similar to the pain reflected on the victim. Article 8 of the Juvenile Delinquent and Vagrant Act states, that if a juvenile is over the age of 16 and commits an offence, under the Penal Code at the judge's discretion they may sentence them to the measures provided in crime, instead of the prescribed penalty. (9) Article 9 states, \"a juvenile may not be condemned to capital punishment\". Juveniles who reach 16 are to be punished under the penal code substituting a sentence of detention not to exceed 10 years. (10)\n\nIt is apparent that the UAE has applied firm penalties in accordance with maintaining the country's respect. Its vast success from new contemporary ideas has inspired other countries to engage in the innovations. With respect to UAE's religion, any showing of body parts such as buttocks, leg breast is deemed indecent and is strictly prohibited. Punishment for indecent exposure if jail or deportation. The body and romantic relationship is sacred and affection should be kept behind closed doors. Public affection is not allowed regardless of relationship status. Kissing and embracing of significant others is offensive and will be reported; holding hands is only affection acceptable.\n\nThe death penalty's purpose is to not only punish, but to rehabilitate criminals and if possible prevent others from committing the same crime. (13) The main goal of the United Arab Emirates is to protect the lives, religion, parentage, intellect, and property of its citizens through rules and regulations that are strictly enforced with no tolerance. There are five crimes that the death penalty is automatically administered for: adultery, rape, armed highway robbery, murder, and apostasy.\n\nIn the Middle East, men are lawfully allowed to marry up to four women provided that he equally divides his time and money to take care of the family needs. (13) If the wives believe they haven’t received their share of his time or expenses than they have the right to ask for a divorce, due to the lack of marital support. The concept of having multiple spouses is to discourage men from committing adultery, having any sexual intercourse outside of marriage. Basically to avoid any bastard children, this in turn can create confusion within the family. The child will not be considered to have a father because his mother was not legally married to him and places the child in a difficult position, psychologically. Adultery is forbidden in order to uphold is mission to protect the livelihood of its citizens.\n\nRape, is extremely unacceptable in this country. The age of sexual maturity is fourteen. (13) Both women and men can be considered the culprit. To be sentenced to the death penalty full intercourse must have occurred. (13) In contrast, it is difficult to prove based on the circumstances of how women are treated in the law. If a women confesses that she has been attack without consent she must immediately alert local authorities in order to assess the crime, if not she will be deemed as agreeing and being full fledge on in non-marital sex and sentenced to death. In addition, if a women is pregnant at the time of her sentencing she is allowed to give birth and suckle the child for two years before her death is complete. (13)\nArmed highway robbery is the impression of taking money from another under the threat of force of arms, thus imposing physical or financial assault. (13) Theft (Al Haraboh) occurs when an individual or group of people prey on others in attempt to take their valuables or property. Citizens have the natural right to obtain anything they have without the threat of someone without authority revoking it from them. The perpetrator who breaks that natural right is going against the ideologies of the country, which no pardon can be given.\n\nUnder Book 1, Article 1 of the Penal Code retributive penalties can apply under the Sharia law. The United Arab Emirates courts follow the Maliki School of Sunni Islam for the use of authority and interpretation from other schools to pronounce the sentences for murder cases. Islamic law defines any sane person who intentionally kills another with a weapon, is a sinner deserving perdition according to the Quran and the murderer is subject to retaliation. (11) Aggravated Murder, in the case of \"deliberate design\" or premeditated purpose is also punishable by death. (11) Unlawful killing such as: killing by fire, drowning in water, throwing from a high place, crushing by pushing down a wall, strangling, prevention of food and water, or exposing to a predatory animal are all likely to cause death, in the event death will be the punishment. (13) Homicides of public employees including ministries, government authorities, and members of the armed forces are considered an attack on the country itself and will be immediately prosecuted.\n\nApostasy or Al Reda is one who turns away from the Islamic religion, whether he or she embraces another religion or says they disbelieve after once believing. This crime is characterized and an intentional act unless under the individual is not at their sound capacity. (13) Any Muslim that denies one of the holy books, the prophets, or rejects any methods of the Islamic worship including prayer, paying Zakat (obligatory payment made annually under Islamic law on certain kinds of property and used for charitable and religious purpose), or fasting will be condemned to life for not abiding by the ordinances set in place for the country. (13) Moreover, if the person proclaims that they are in disbelief but is unaware of their statements they will be questioned once they regain their normal state of mind. Once they have gain clarity of themselves and deny any statements made in that stage than they will not be held liable for their action or comments. (13)\n\nOther crimes that can be accountable for readmission for the death penalty are perjury/calumny, inciting suicide, drinking (the use of drug-induced state of mind to incite a person to commit an offense; drinking and driving results in jail, fines, and deportation, (12) arson, kidnapping, drug trafficking (severe crime with a zero tolerance policy toward illegal drug use) (12), and human trafficking.\n\nAll of these crimes have been committed but are infrequent due to the punishment of death. During the process of execution a deputy of the ministry, doctor, convict's lawyer and one of the member of the public prosecution are present. Relatives of the criminal are able to visit that day prior to the implementation of the sentence.\n\nReferences:\n(1)\"The Story of the UAE.\" Zayed University, United Arab Emirates. N.p., n.d.

It was broadcast on BBC Two in January 1972 and adapted into a book of the same name. \n\nThe series was intended as a response to Kenneth Clark's \"Civilisation\" series, which represents a more traditionalist view of the Western artistic and cultural canon, and the series and book criticize traditional Western cultural aesthetics by raising questions about hidden ideologies in visual images.\n\nThe book \"Ways of Seeing\" was written by Berger and Dibb, along with Sven Blomberg, Chris Fox, and Richard Hollis. The book consists of seven numbered essays: four using words and images; and three essays using only images. \n\nThe book has contributed to feminist readings of popular culture, through essays that focus particularly on how women are portrayed in advertisements and oil paintings. \"Berger, who died on 2 January 2017 at the age of 90, has had a profound influence on the popular understanding of art and the visual image,\" according to sociologists Yasmin Gunaratnam and Vikki Bell.\n\n"}
