The Ancient Kano City Walls were described as \"'the most impressive monument in West Africa\".\n\nThe Ancient Kano City Walls were built as a defensive wall with the construction of the foundation laid by Sarki Gijimasu (1095–1134), the third king of in the Kano Chronicle. In the mid 14th century during the reign of Zamnagawa, the wall was completed before it was further expanded during the 16th century.

{"id": "179093", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=179093", "title": "Aphasiology", "text": "Aphasiology\n\nAphasiology is the study of language impairment usually resulting from brain damage, due to neurovascular accident—hemorrhage, stroke—or associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including different types of dementia. It is also the name of a scientific journal covering the area. These specific language deficits, termed aphasias, may be defined as impairments of language production or comprehension that cannot be attributed to trivial causes such as deafness or oral paralysis. A number of aphasias have been described, but two are best known: expressive aphasia (Broca's aphasia) and receptive aphasia (Wernicke's or sensory aphasia).\n\nAcute aphasias are often the result of tissue damage following a stroke.\n\nFirst described by the French neurologist Paul Broca in the nineteenth century, expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits. It is characterized by a halting speech consisting mainly of content words, i.e. nouns and verbs, and, at least in English, distinctly lacking small grammatical function words such as articles and prepositions. This observation gave rise to the terms telegraphic speech and, more recently, agrammatism. The extent to which expressive aphasics retain knowledge of grammar is a matter of considerable controversy. Nonetheless, because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved, and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across, the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences.\n\nThe view of expressive aphasia as an expressive disorder is supported by its frequent co-occurrence with facial motor difficulties, and its anatomical localization. Although expressive aphasia may be caused by brain damage to many regions, it is most commonly associated with the inferior frontal gyrus, a region that overlaps with motor cortex controlling the mouth and tongue, extending into the periventricular white matter. Not surprisingly, this region has come to be known as \"Broca's area\". However, an intriguing line of research has demonstrated specific comprehension deficits in expressive aphasics as well. These deficits generally involve sentences that are grammatical, but atypical in their word order. The simplest example is sentences in the passive voice, such as \"The boy was chased by the girl.\" Expressive aphasics may have quite a hard time realizing that the girl is doing the chasing, but they do much better with \"The mouse was chased by the cat,\" where world knowledge constraints contribute to the correct interpretation. However, \"The cat was chased by the mouse\" would likewise be incomprehensible. This evidence suggests that grammatical competence may be a specific function of Broca's area.\n\nLesions exclusively to Broca's area (the foot of the inferior frontal gyrus) do not produce Broca's aphasia, but instead mild dysprosody and agraphia, sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild dysarthria. Not much is known about what other areas must be damaged in order to produce Broca's aphasia, but some maintain damage to the inferior pre-Rolandic motor strip (the motor cortex region responsible glossopharyngeal muscle control) is also necessary.\n\nReceptive aphasia was originally described by the German neurologist Karl Wernicke, a contemporary of Broca. Receptive aphasics produce speech that seems fluent and grammatical, but is largely devoid of sensible content. Comprehension is severely impaired, but while patients display a great deal of difficulty comprehending individual words, they can more easily understand words in context. Receptive aphasia is associated with the posterior third of the superior temporal gyrus in the distribution of the inferior division of the middle cerebral artery, known as \"Wernicke's area\", an area adjacent to the cortex responsible for auditory processing. If the damage extends posteriorly, visual connections are disrupted, and the patient will have difficulty understanding written language. Therefore, the localization of the two best-known aphasias mirrors the grossest dichotomy in brain organization: anterior areas are specialized for motor output, and posterior areas for sensory processing.\n\nA fascinating corollary of this has come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language, who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to Expressive and Receptive aphasias in hearing populations. These studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of Broca's area and the semantic functions of Wernicke's area are indeed deep, abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression.\n\nAnother less commonly known aphasia is global aphasia, which generally manifests itself after a stroke affecting an extensive portion of the brain occurs, including infarction of both divisions of the middle cerebral artery and generally both Broca's area and Wernicke's area. Survivors with global aphasia may have great difficulty understanding and forming words and sentences, and generally experience a great deal of difficulty when trying to communicate. With considerable speech therapy rehabilitation, global aphasia may progress into expressive aphasia or receptive aphasia.\n\nA person with anomic aphasia have word-finding difficulties. Anomic aphasia, also known as anomia, is a non-fluent aphasia, which means the person speaks hesitantly because of a difficulty naming words and/or producing correct syntax. The person struggles to find the right words for speaking and writing. Subjects tend to use circumulations, in which they speak around the word they can not find, to make up for their loss. People also with anomic aphasia tend to know how to use an object, but rather can not name the aforementioned object. Any damage in or near the zone of language can result in anomic aphasia. Other forms of aphasia often transition into a syndrome of primarily anomic aphasia in the process of recovery.\n\nConduction Aphasia is a rare form of aphasia in which fibres in the arcuate fasciculus and superior longitudinal fasciculus are damaged. These fibres are the link between the Wernicke's and Broca's area. Damage to the area connecting comprehension and expression together has the following symptoms: fluent speech, good comprehension, poor oral reading, repetition is poor and transpositions of sounds within words is very common.\n\nPrimary progressive aphasia is a rare disorder where people slowly lose their ability to talk, read, write, and comprehend what they hear in conversation over a period of time. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by Mesulam in 1982. There are three variants: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA), semantic dementia (SD), and logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA).\n\nThe nineteenth century marked the most important time in the evolution of aphasiology, beginning with the works of Franz Josef Gall. Gall is the founder of the more modern localization theory and is the origin of the idea of a language center in the brain. However, supporting evidence for the theory that language had its own anatomical representation was not found until the case study of Mr. Leborgne, also known as Tan, by Paul Broca in 1861. The discovery of what is now known as Broca's area was followed years later by Carl Wernicke's famous work, 'The Symptom-Complex of Aphasia: A Psychological Study on an Anatomical Basis' in 1874. This paper is regarded as one of the most influential works in the history of the field of aphasiology. In it, Wernicke described many of the different classifications of aphasia and is the basis for the classical model of aphasia.\n\n"}
{"id": "2843092", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2843092", "title": "Arctic Council", "text": "Arctic Council\n\nThe Arctic Council is a high-level intergovernmental forum that addresses issues faced by the Arctic governments and the indigenous people of the Arctic. Eight member countries constitute the council: Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States as these are the eight countries with sovereignty over the lands within the Arctic Circle. Outside these, there are some observer states.\n\nThe first step towards the formation of the Council occurred in 1991 when the eight Arctic countries signed the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS). The 1996 Ottawa Declaration established the Arctic Council as a forum for promoting cooperation, coordination, and interaction among the Arctic States, with the involvement of the Arctic Indigenous communities and other Arctic inhabitants on issues such as sustainable development and environmental protection. The Arctic Council has conducted studies on climate change, oil and gas, and Arctic shipping.\n\nIn 2011, the Council member states concluded the Arctic Search and Rescue Agreement, the first binding treaty concluded under the Council's auspices.\n\nOnly states with territory in the Arctic can be members of the Council. All eight countries are members making the Arctic Council a circumpolar forum. The Council also has permanent and ad hoc observer countries and \"permanent participants\".\n\nThe member states consist of the following:\n\nObserver status is open to non-Arctic states approved by the Council at the Ministerial Meetings that occur once every two years. Observers have no voting rights in the Council. As of May 2017, thirteen non-Arctic states have Observer status. Observer states receive invitations for most Council meetings. Their participation in projects and task forces within the Working Groups is not always possible, but this poses few problems as few Observer States want to participate at such a detailed level.\n\nObserver states consist of the following (2017):\n\nIn 2011, the Council clarified its criteria for admission of observers, most notably including a requirement of applicants to \"recognize Arctic States' sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction in the Arctic\" and \"recognize that an extensive legal framework applies to the Arctic Ocean including, notably, the Law of the Sea, and that this framework provides a solid foundation for responsible management of this ocean\".\n\nPending observer states need to request permission for their presence at each individual meeting; such requests are routine and most of them are granted. At the 2013 Ministerial Meeting in Kiruna, Sweden, the EU requested full observer status. It was not granted, mostly because the members do not agree on the EU ban on hunting seals.\n\nThe indigenous Permanent Participants (PPs) have mixed views about the increasing group of non-Arctic observers. Some fear that their roles will be marginalized if large players such as the EU receive more attention.\n\nPending observer states are:\nEuropean Union and\nTurkey.\n\nThe role of observers was re-evaluated, as were the criteria for admission. As a result, the distinction between permanent and ad hoc observers were dropped.\n\nChairmanship of the Council rotates every two years. The current chair is Finland, which serves until the Ministerial meeting in 2019.\n\n\nNorway, Denmark and Sweden have agreed on a set of common priorities for the three chairmanships. They also agreed to a shared secretariat 2009–2013.\n\nSix Arctic indigenous communities have the status of Permanent Participants on the Council. These groups are represented by the Aleut International Association, Arctic Athabaskan Council, Gwich'in Council International, Inuit Circumpolar Council, Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North, and the Saami Council. They are assisted by the Arctic Council Indigenous Peoples Secretariat.\n\nApproved intergovernmental and interparliamentary organizations (both global and regional) and non-governmental organizations can also obtain Observer Status. They include the Arctic Parliamentarians, International Union for Conservation of Nature, the International Red Cross Federation, the Nordic Council, the Northern Forum, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations Environment Programme; and a handful of non-governmental organizations such as the Association of World Reindeer Herders, Oceana, the University of the Arctic, and the World Wide Fund for Nature-Arctic Programme.\n\nSeven of the eight member states have sizeable indigenous communities living in their Arctic areas (only Iceland does not). Organizations of Arctic indigenous peoples can obtain the status of Permanent Participant to the Arctic Council, but only if they represent a single indigenous people resident in more than one Arctic State or more than one Arctic indigenous people resident in a single Arctic State. The number of Permanent Participants should at any time be less than the number of members. The category of Permanent Participants has been created to provide for active participation and full consultation with the Arctic indigenous representatives within the Arctic Council. This principle applies to all meetings and activities of the Arctic Council.\n\nPermanent Participants may address the meetings. They may raise points of order that require immediate decision by the Chairman. Agendas of Ministerial Meetings need to be consulted beforehand with them; they may propose supplementary agenda items. When calling the biannual meetings of Senior Arctic Officials, the Permanent Participants must have been consulted beforehand. Finally, Permanent Participants may propose cooperative activities, such as projects. All this makes the position of Arctic indigenous peoples within the Arctic Council quite unique compared to the (often marginal) role of such peoples in other international governmental fora. However, decision making in the Arctic Council remains in the hands of the eight member states, on the basis of consensus.\n\nAs of 2014, six Arctic indigenous communities have Permanent Participant status. These groups are represented by the Aleut International Association, Arctic Athabaskan Council, Gwich'in Council International, Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON), and the Saami Council. These indigenous organisations vary widely in their organisational capacities and the size of the population they represent. To illustrate, RAIPON represents some 250,000 indigenous people of various (mostly Siberian) tribes; the ICC some 150,000 Inuit. On the other hand, the Gwich'in Council and the Aleut Association each represent only a few thousand people.\n\nIt is costly for these groups to be represented at every Council meeting, especially since they take place across the entire circumpolar realm. To enhance the capacity of the PPs to pursue the objectives of the Arctic Council and to assist them develop their internal capacity to participate and intervene in Council meetings, the Council has established—and provides financial support to—the Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat (IPS). The IPS is located in Copenhagen, Denmark and its board decides on the allocation of the funds.\n\nHowever prominent the role of indigenous peoples, the Permanent Participant status does not confer any legal recognition as peoples. The Ottawa Declaration, the Arctic Council's founding document, explicitly states (in a footnote): \"The use of the term 'peoples' in this declaration shall not be construed as having any implications as regard the rights which may attach to the term under international law.\" Incidentally, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 13 September 2007 after 22 years of negotiations, was rejected by Canada and the United States, while Russia abstained. Both the United States and Canada have their origins as colonies of the United Kingdom and have large non-indigenous immigrant majorities and small indigenous populations. This means that most Arctic indigenous people were not covered by the rights laid out in the declaration. In November 2010, Canada officially endorsed the declaration and in December of that year President Obama declared the United States would sign the declaration.\n\nThe Arctic Council convenes every six months somewhere in the Chair's country for a Senior Arctic Officials (SAO) meeting. SAOs are high-level representatives from the eight member nations. Sometimes they are ambassadors, but often they are senior foreign ministry officials entrusted with staff-level coordination. Representatives of the six Permanent Participants and the official Observers also are in attendance.\n\nAt the end of the two-year cycle, the Chair hosts a Ministerial-level meeting, which is the culmination of the Council's work for that period. Most of the eight member nations are represented by a Minister from their Foreign Affairs, Northern Affairs, or Environment Ministry.\n\nA formal, though non-binding, \"Declaration\", named for the town in which the meeting is held, sums up the past accomplishments and the future work of the Council. These Declarations cover climate change, sustainable development, Arctic monitoring and assessment, persistent organic pollutants and other contaminants, and the work of the Council's five Working Groups.\n\nArctic Council working groups document Arctic problems and challenges such as sea ice loss, glacier melting, tundra thawing, increase of mercury in food chains, and ocean acidification affecting the entire marine ecosystem. Arctic Council members agreed to action points on protecting the Arctic but most have never materialized. The last Ministerial meeting took place May 11, 2017 in Fairbanks, Alaska, United States.\n\nEach rotating Chair nation accepts responsibility for maintaining the secretariat, which handles the administrative aspects of the Council, including organizing semiannual meetings, hosting the website, and distributing reports and documents. The Norwegian Polar Institute hosted the Arctic Council Secretariat for the six-year period from 2007 to 2013; this was based on an agreement between the three successive Scandinavian Chairs, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. This temporary Secretariat had a staff of three.\n\nIn 2012 the Council moved towards creating a permanent secretariat in Tromsø, Norway. Magnús Jóhannesson (Iceland) is the director since 1 February 2013.\n\nIn addition, the Arctic Council works through six Working Groups and four Programs and Action Plans:\n\n\nPrograms and Action Plans\n\nThe Arctic Council is often in the middle of security and geopolitical issues since the Arctic has peculiar interests to Member States and Observers. When the Arctic Council was founded in 1996, peace and security concerns were left out of its mandate. However, changes in the arctic environment and participants of the Arctic Council have led to a reconsideration of the relationship between geopolitical matters and the role of the Arctic Council.\n\nDue to climate change and melting of the Arctic sea-ice, more energy resources and waterways are now becoming accessible. Large reserves of oil, gas and minerals are located within the Arctic. This environmental factor generated territorial disputes among Member States. The Law of the Sea allows states to extend their EEZ (which allows exploitation of resources) if the states can prove that their continental shelf extends beyond the 200 nm limit. Countries are claiming their sea at the utmost reach from their coastlines. There are disputes over several rocks located between Greenland and Canada, the Bering and Chukchi Seas between Russia and America, and Hans Island and the Lincoln Sea between Canada and Denmark. In addition, a poll indicated that half of Canadian respondents said Canada should try to assert its full sovereignty rights over the Beaufort Sea compared to just 10 percent of Americans. New commercial trans-Arctic shipping routes can be another factor of conflicts. A poll found that Canadians perceive the Northwest Passage as their internal Canadian waterway whereas other countries perceive it as an international waterway.\n\nIncrease in number of Permanent Observers drew other national security issues. Observers are showing their interests in the Arctic region. China explicitly shown its desire to extract natural resources in Greenland. Other interests are hidden which can eventually weaken Member States' presence in some way.\n\nMilitary infrastructure is another point to consider. Except for U.S., defense commitment of Canada, Denmark, Norway and Russia is rapidly growing by military presence and building infrastructure.\n\nHowever, some say that the Arctic Council facilitates stability despite possible conflicts among Member States. A Norwegian admiral Haakon Bruun Hanssen says the Arctic is \"probably the most stable area in the world\". They say that laws are well established and followed. Member states think that sharing cost of the development of Arctic shipping-lanes, research etc. by cooperation and good relationships between states is beneficial to all.\n\nLooking at these two different perspectives, some suggest that Arctic Council should expand its role by including peace and security issues as its agenda. The survey demonstrates that two thirds of constituencies (Nordic states) were very supportive on the issues of an Arctic nuclear-weapons free zone. More than 80 percent of Russians agreed that Arctic Council should cover peace-building issues. They think that solving security matters in the Arctic Council will shorten a great amount of time than in UN. However, as of June 2014, military security matters are often avoided. The focus on science and resource protection and management is seen as a priority, which may be diluted or strained by geopolitical security issues.\n\n\n"}

It was established as an experiment in 1967 by the California State Library and closed down in 1988, when the funding from the US Federal Government that it relied on was ended. It pioneered the use of networking technologies such as teletype and fax machines in providing reference services to patrons at far-flung, sometimes rural libraries. Its magazine, \"Synergy\", won two ALA awards.\n\nStudies of public library services in California had shown that large parts of the state, particularly rural areas, were underserved. In response, a 1962 master plan called for the establishment of four levels of library services: local libraries, regional reference centers, tertiary reference centers covering larger regions, and as the fourth and final level, the State Library in Sacramento. The Bay Area Reference Center was established in August 1967 as a tertiary center, or \"source of last resort\", as a collaboration between the San Francisco Public Library and the North Bay Cooperative Library System (NBCLS), a consortium of nine public library systems including 17 libraries in six counties north of San Francisco, with its headquarters in Santa Rosa. It was made possible by a federal grant under the 1964 Library Services and Construction Act; the initial grant was $750,735 for a two-year pilot project. A corresponding service was set up for Southern California, the Southern California Answering Network (SCAN).\n\nPatron questions that could not be answered locally were referred first to one of three secondary reference centers within the system, located at the Vallejo Public Library, the Ukiah-Mendocino County Library, and the Santa Rosa-Sonoma County Public Library. If still unanswerable, they were sent on via a six-day-a-week teletype link to BARC at the San Francisco Main Library. Five NBCLS libraries, the San Francisco Main Library and two San Francisco branches, including the downtown business branch, also had fax machines that were sometimes used for delivering information to patrons. BARC had its own director, assistant director, clerical workers, and eight subject specialists, and acquired specialist reference materials to supplement those already available in the San Francisco library system. The staff also researched some questions in person and by phone and fax, and formed relationships with the libraries at the University of California, Berkeley, NASA, the Library of Congress, the British Museum, and corporations in the region that had specialized libraries. There were frequent interchanges and staff visits between the NBCLS libraries and BARC.\n\nBARC staff conducted biweekly workshops for reference librarians and published bibliographies on topics including the Chinese in California and the San Francisco Public Library's collection on theatrical costumes.\n\nBeginning in 1967 BARC published a bibliographic magazine called \"Synergy\". This included controversial topics of the day, such as \"the New Left, the New Right, the underground press, feminism, and gay liberation.\" It twice won the ALA's H. W. Wilson Library Periodical Award, and was so popular its circulation was capped for cost reasons after reaching 2,000, but after its second editor, Celeste West, published an unflattering photograph of Richard Nixon in 1973, its funding was withdrawn by the state librarian, Ethel Crockett. Edward Swanson, president of the Minnesota Library Association, published a protest resolution in the ALA journal, and West's reprimand for unprofessional behavior was withdrawn, but \"Synergy\" was replaced by \"BARC Notes\".\n\nBARC closed down after the federal funding on which it depended was ended in 1988.\n\nWhen it closed, BARC served a region populated by 12 million people. In 1978, one analyst saw potential in such pooling of resources to serve a region. In 1984, a comparison of responses to the same genuine patron queries by BARC, the second-level reference center in Fresno, and a for-profit reference service, Information on Demand, showed that BARC's answers were usually better than the Fresno center's as a result of the depth of its resources, but that none of the three answered all the test questions correctly and quickly. The tertiary reference centers were expensive: in 1986 BARC and its Southern Californian counterpart, SCAN, estimated the cost of answering each query at $150, and the California State Library launched a study of costs of the two centers.\n\nRichard Coenenberg was the first director of BARC. Assistant Director Gil MacNamee later became director. In addition to West, Peggy Barber, later an ALA staff member, was one of the librarians.\n"}

The cave is roughly wide, high and deep. It has a single entrance that faces southwest and is well-lit during the daytime.\n\nThe cave holds alluvial deposits containing the remains of Pleistocene megafauna, including mammoths, ground sloths, and even-toed ungulates. Archaeological excavation of the site in 1983 and 1984 by paleontologists Larry Agenboard and Jim Mead unearthed animal bones, dung, hair, and teeth dating from 11,555 BCE to 9720 BCE, underneath \"a few feet\" of cave fill, consisting of ceiling spall and wind-blown sand, containing evidence of Holocene habitation from the Archaic period to the Basketmaker culture and possibly even by Navajo or Paiute. Among the items unearthed were large dung boluses, similar in size to the dung of the African elephant, containing the stems of graminoids and sedge (\"Carex\"). The cave is also one of at least seventeen sites on the Colorado Plateau where Archaic-era Southwestern sandals have been discovered.\n\nThe cave's name derives from a Navajo word meaning \"big dung\" or \"big feces\". The well-preserved dung layer was deposited over approximately 1,000 years by multiple animal species during a period characterized by the proliferation of oak and the decline of blue spruce and water birch. The organic deposit consists primarily of Columbian mammoth (\"M. columbi\") dung but also includes dung belonging to shrub-oxen (\"E. collinum\"), Shasta ground sloths (\"N. shastensis\"), Harrington's mountain goats (\"O. harringtoni\"), bighorn sheep (\"O. canadensis\"), cottontail rabbits, pack rats, and possibly equines. With a thickness ranging between , an area of more than , and a volume of , it is the largest coprolite deposit in North America. Other macrofossils discovered in Bechan Cave include teeth and a bone, a \"metapodial condyle\", belonging to \"E. collinum\".\n\nThe cave is located inside Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and, though it is rarely visited, is accessible on foot from Bowns Canyon. The round-trip hike between Bowns Canyon, which can be reached from Lake Powell by boat, and Bechan Cave is considered moderately difficult.\n\n\n"}

The troupe toured together for six years beginning in January 2000 at Omaha, Nebraska before finishing in 2006 at the Warner Theatre in Washington D.C.\n\nJeff Foxworthy had already established himself as a well-known, Grammy Award-winning stand-up comedian, best known for his jokes and stories about life as a redneck. Foxworthy had cast best friend Engvall in the NBC version of \"The Jeff Foxworthy Show\", and featured Larry on his nationally syndicated, weekly, country radio show \"The Foxworthy Countdown\". White was brought on as his comedy is based around personal experiences retold in his smoking, drinking Southern United States persona. The tour that featured these four \"good ole boys\" proved to be such a hit that they recorded a live album in November 2001 and the first DVD called \"Blue Collar Comedy Tour: The Movie\" in the spring of 2003.\n\nAfter the success of the tour, album and live DVD, the comedians recorded a second live DVD called \"Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again\" and a series on The WB called \"Blue Collar TV\". Ron White was on the second DVD, and although he was not a regular on the TV show he did make guest appearances. A third Blue Collar movie was produced for Comedy Central titled \"Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One for the Road\", which premiered on the channel in June 2006. \"Blue Collar Comedy Tour: One for The Road\" was released on DVD in June 2006.\n\n\nIn March 2006, the group started a Blue Collar Comedy channel on Sirius Satellite Radio titled \"Blue Collar Radio\". The station features not only various stand-up acts from the four members but various acts from other working class-esque comedians such as Brian Regan, Rodney Carrington, Kathleen Madigan, John Caponera, Rodney Dangerfield, Ray Romano, and others as well. When Sirius Satellite Radio merged with XM Satellite Radio, this brought more coverage of the channel.

It examines black writers in the interwar period, focusing on sites of interaction between Anglophone and Francophone black writers to develop an argument about the generative potential of translation, specifically in the black diaspora. Among other influences, Edwards draws on Stuart Hall's use of the concept of articulation to develop a theoretical use of the French term décalage, \"referring to a shift in space or time or the gap that results from it...[Edwards argues] that these disparate locations are, like joints, sites of potential forward motion.\"\n\nEdwards also edited the collection \"Uptown Conversation: The New Jazz Studies\" (Columbia University Press, 2004) with Farah Jasmine Griffin and Robert G. O'Meally.\n\nIn 2009, Edwards edited a new printing of W.E.B. DuBois's \"The Souls of Black Folk\" from Oxford University Press.\n\nEdwards serves on the editorial boards of Callalloo and Transition.\n\nIn 2009, Edwards's graduate student Jean-Christophe Cloutier discovered a manuscript in Columbia's Rare Book and Manuscript Library in the papers of writer Samuel Roth. In 2012, Edwards and Cloutier, in consultation with other experts and after examining archival materials and personal correspondence, authenticated the manuscript as a previously unknown 1941 work by Claude McKay, called \"Amiable With Big Teeth: A Novel of the Love Affair Between the Communists and the Poor Black Sheep of Harlem\". Henry Louis Gates, who served as one of the experts evaluating the manuscript's authenticity, called it a \"major discovery...It dramatically expands the canon of novels written by Harlem Renaissance writers.\"\n\nIn 2004, Edwards's book \"The Practice of Diaspora\" won the John Hope Franklin Prize from the American Studies Association and the Gilbert Chinard Prize of the Society for French Historical Studies, and an honorable mention for the James Russell Lowell Prize of the Modern Language Association.\n\nIn 2005, Edwards won the New York Public Library's Dorothy and Lewis B.

Some critics use the label to refer only to non-supernatural horror stories, especially those that have nasty climactic twists, but it is applicable to any story whose conclusion exploits the cruel aspects of the 'irony of fate.' The collection from which the short-story genre of the conte cruel takes its name is \"Contes cruels\" (1883, tr. Sardonic Tales, 1927) by Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. Also taking its name from this collection is \"Contes cruels\" (\"Cruel Tales\"), a two-volume set of about 150 tales and short stories by the 19th-century French writer Octave Mirbeau, collected and edited by Pierre Michel and Jean-François Nivet and published in two volumes in 1990 by Librairie Séguier. \n\nSome noted writers in the conte cruel genre are Charles Birkin, Maurice Level, Patricia Highsmith and Roald Dahl, the latter of whom originated \"Tales of the Unexpected\". H. P. Lovecraft observed of Level's fiction in his essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" (1927): \"This type, however, is less a part of the weird tradition than a class peculiar to itself—the so-called conte cruel, in which the wrenching of the emotions is accomplished through dramatic tantalizations, frustrations, and gruesome physical horrors\".\n\nBrian M. Stableford has observed that, by the 1980s, the conte cruel was the standard narrative form of soft science fiction, in particular the works of Thomas M. Disch and John Sladek. \n"}

These events can be for large audiences such as conventions and conferences, or smaller events such as retreats, holiday parties or even private concerts.\n\nIt is also commonly used to mean corporate hospitality, the process of entertaining guests at corporate events.\n\nThe companies that provides corporate entertainment are called corporate event planners or corporate booking agencies.\n\nThere are various types of corporate events that make use of entertainment. An opening general session may include entertainment that adds excitement and presents the overall theme of the meeting. Mixers or pre-dinner parties many times use entertainment meant to provide a backdrop for conversation, perhaps an acoustic ensemble or pre-recorded music. Awards or gala events, usually the last event in a series of meetings, can make use of many options, from celebrity entertainers to exciting bands providing dance music or other options that will leave the attendees with a feeling of excitement and looking forward to the next meeting. There are many different types of corporate entertainment.\n\nCorporate entertainment can also include a day of team building activities. These activities include traditional camp activities like tug of war, scavenger hunts, and relay races. They could also include sports such as volleyball, soccer, or basketball. The goal of team building corporate entertainment is to have employees recognize how the challenges of the activities relate to the workplace. Team chemistry, identifying strengths and attributes, understanding how to work through solving problems as one, and reflecting makes for fruitful team building.\n\nAwards or gala events are usually lavish events that celebrate accomplishment or milestones of a person or group of people in similar industries. Often these events serve as fundraisers for a specific cause. In addition to celebrating and recognizing achievements, it allows attendees to network with others with similar backgrounds or professions.\n\nHoliday celebration events are ways for companies or departments to celebrate holidays and to show appreciation to employees. Entertainment at these events vary from raffles and door prizes, mystery dinners, music and an overall casual, social setting that can build social relationships. For Christmas celebrations, some companies have used the \"A Christmas Story\" theme.\n\nCorporate seminars, workshops, symposiums, and conferences are more informative in nature and often focussed on educational purposes. A conference refers to a formal meeting where participants exchange their views on various topics. A seminar is a form of academic instruction, either at a university or offered by a commercial or professional organization. A workshop includes all the elements of the seminar, but with the largest portion emphasizing “hands-on-practice” or laboratory work. A symposium is a formal gathering in an academic setting where participants are experts in their fields. Entertainment for these events varies from kick-op brunches to start, special industry guest speakers, and mixers, dinners afterwards. There are also booths set up for trade shows to display a companies strengths and for better marketing.\n\nCorporate charity events, whether concerts, golf tournaments, or anything else, play an important role in how businesses interact with the community. Corporate charity events unite people from all levels of the organization; such events are another form of team building which positively influence other aspects of work.\n"}

The first version, written in vernacular Italian in 1435 under the title Della pittura, was for a general audience. The Latin version, the \"De pictura\" of 1439–41, was more technical and intended for scholars. The work is the first in a trilogy of treatises on the \"Major arts\" which had a widespread circulation during the Renaissance, the others being \"De re aedificatoria\" (\"On Architecture\", 1454) and \"De statua\" (\"On Sculpture\", 1462).\n\nAlberti was a member of Florentine family exiled in the 14th century, who was able to return in Florence only from 1434, in the following of the Papal court during the Council of Florence. Here he knew contemporary art innovators such as Filippo Brunelleschi, Donatello and Masaccio, with whom he shared an interest for Renaissance humanism and classical art. Alberti was the first post-classical writer to produce a work of art theory, as opposed to works about the function of religious art or art techniques, and reflected the developing Italian Renaissance art of his day.\n\nBook I: a simple introduction for young boys, in preparation for studying painting\n\nBook II: a survey of types of painting for teenage trainees in a workshop\n\nBook III: advice to the adult painter on how to perfect his skill\n\n\"De pictura\" aimed to describe systematically the figurative arts through \"geometry\". Alberti divided painting into three parts:\n\nThe treatise contained an analysis of all the techniques and painting theories known at the time, in this surpassing medieval works such as \"The book of Art\" by Cennino Cennini (1390). \"De pictura\" also includes the first description of linear geometric perspective around 1416; Alberti credited the discovery to Brunelleschi, and dedicated the 1435 edition to him.\n\nAlberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.\n\n\"De pictura\" relied heavily on references to art in classical literature; in fact Giotto's huge \"Navicella\" in mosaic at Old St. Peter's Basilica in Rome (now effectively lost) was the only modern (post-classical) work described in it.\n\n\"De pictura\" influenced the work of artists including Donatello, Ghiberti, Botticelli, and Ghirlandaio. His treatment of perspective was the most influential of his recommendations, having a powerful effect on Leonardo da Vinci, and through him on the whole Italian renaissance.\n\nAlberti made at least 29 uses of Pliny the Elder's \"Natural History\", deriving his key themes of simplicity and seriousness directly from Pliny. For example, Alberti advised artists to use colour with restraint, and to paint in the effect of gold rather than using actual gold in their paintings. Gold did indeed vanish from Italian paintings of the second part of the 15th century. Artists however found their own ways to paint with restraint, rather than following Alberti's actual instructions directly. Similarly, he encouraged artists to add black when modelling shapes, rather than only adding white as Cennino Cennini had advised in his c. 1390 \"Il Libro dell'Arte\". This advice had the effect of making Italian renaissance paintings more sombre. Alberti was here perhaps following Pliny's description of the dark varnish used by Apelles.\n\n"}
{"id": "571427", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=571427", "title": "Deviancy amplification spiral", "text": "Deviancy amplification spiral\n\nA deviancy amplification spiral (also called deviance amplification) is a media hype phenomenon defined by media critics as a cycle of increasing numbers of reports on a category of antisocial behaviour or some other 'undesirable' event, leading to a moral panic.\n\nThe process of deviancy amplification was first described by Leslie T. Wilkins. Stanley Cohen adopted this theory in \"Folk Devils and Moral Panics\", and applied it to the case scenario of the \"Mods and Rockers\", in which he identified the concept of the deviancy amplification spiral.\n\nAccording to Cohen, the spiral starts with some 'deviant' act. Usually the deviance is criminal, but it can also involve lawful acts considered morally repugnant by a large segment of society. With the new focus on the issue, hidden or borderline examples that would not themselves have been newsworthy are reported, confirming the 'pattern'.\n\nReported cases of such 'deviance' are often presented as just 'the ones we know about' or the 'tip of the iceberg', an assertion that is nearly impossible to disprove immediately. For a variety of reasons, the less sensational aspects of the spiraling story that would help the public keep a rational perspective (such as statistics showing that the behavior or event is actually less common or less harmful than generally believed) tend to be ignored by the press.\n\nAs a result, minor problems begin to look serious and rare events begin to seem common. Members of the public are motivated to keep informed on these events, leading to high readership for the stories, feeding the spiral. The resulting publicity has the potential to increase the deviant behavior by glamorizing it, or by making it seem common or acceptable. In the next stage, public concern typically forces the police and the law enforcement system to focus more resources on dealing with the specific deviancy than it warrants.\n\nJudges and magistrates then come under public pressure to deal out harsher sentences and politicians pass new laws to increase their popularity by giving the impression that they are dealing with the perceived threat. The responses by those in authority tend to reinforce the public's fear, while the media continue to report police and other law enforcement activity, amplifying the spiral.\n\nThe theory does not contend that moral panics always include the deviancy amplification spiral.\n\nEileen Barker asserts that the controversy surrounding certain new religious movements can turn violent in a deviancy amplification spiral. In his autobiography, Lincoln Steffens details how news reporting can be used to create the impression of a crime wave where there is none, in the chapter \"I Make a Crime Wave\".\n\nButton and Tunley have also presented a theory that offers the opposite to deviancy amplification, which they call deviancy attenuation. In this they argue using the case of fraud that there are some large problems, which those in positions of power are able to attenuate through not accurately measuring it, leading to statistics which under-estimate the problem, leading to less resources dedicated to it, re-enforcing the belief of those in power it is not a problem.\n\n"}
{"id": "20696342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20696342", "title": "Dick Whittington and His Cat", "text": "Dick Whittington and His Cat\n\nDick Whittington and His Cat is the English folklore surrounding the real-life Richard Whittington (c. 1354–1423), wealthy merchant and later Lord Mayor of London. The legend describes his rise from poverty-stricken childhood with the fortune he made through the sale of his cat to a rat-infested country. However, the real Whittington did not come from a poor family of common stock, and there is no compelling evidence supporting the stories about the cat, or even whether he owned one. There is also conjecture that certain aspects of the story, in fact, relate to a different occupant of the office of Lord Mayor, Sir William Craven who was Lord Mayor in 1610, around the same date as the first written records of the story, and whose life had much more in common with that reflected in the story.\n\nAnother element in the legend is that Dick attempted to flee his service as a scullion one night, heading towards home (or reached Highgate Hill in later tradition), but was dissuaded by the sound of Bow bells, which promised he would be mayor of London one day.\n\nSince the pre-Victorian era, the story has been a favourite subject of English pantomime, especially during Christmas season.\n\nWritten forms date from the early 1600s, long after the death of the historical Whittington. A drama play (1604–5) and ballad (1605) are lost, and Richard Johnson's ballad of 1612 is the earliest surviving piece that refer to Whittington making his fortune with his cat. This early ballad already contains the tradition that Whittington fled his 's service and traveled towards home, but was beckoned back by the London bells which predicted his future of becoming mayor. It has also been speculated that the story, in reality, had its origins as a satire against the humble origins of a different Lord Mayor of London, Sir William Craven , who held the office in 1610. This theory is supported by the chronology of the story's origins, and by the fact that Sir William Craven's life had many more real parallels to the story than that of Sir Richard Whittington, who, unlike Craven, was never born into poverty. It seems likely that the story combines elements of both.\n\nThe earliest known prose rendition is \"The Famous and Remarkable History of Sir Richard Whittington\" by \"T. H.\" (Thomas Heywood), published 1656 in chapbook form, which specified that the bells were those of Bow Church (St Mary-le-Bow), and that the boy heard them at Bunhill. Common chapbooks of a later period wrote that the boy reached as far as Holloway on the night he fled. Links to this village has not been corroborated in early folklore or literature, and is thought to be an 18th-century invention. But based on this tradition, the landmark Whittington Stone at the foot of Highgate Hill is commonly perceived to be the place where Dick Whittingon stopped and heard the famous bells.\n\nThe story was adapted into puppet play by Martin Powell in the early 18th century. Later, it has been performed as stage pantomimes and children's plays. It has also been retold as a children's story by a number of printers and authors to this day.\n\nA number of foreign and medieval analogues exist that exhibit the motif (\"Whittington's cat\" motif, N411.2), where the hero obtains wealth by selling a cat, typically in a rodent-infested place direly in need of one. The tale is catalogued Aarne–Thompson (AT) tale type 1651, \"Whittington's Cat\".\n\nThe following summary gives a comparison of three textual sources. B = Johnson's ballad, H = prose by Heywood, signed T. H. (Wheatley ed.); C = Late chapbook (18th to 19th-century printing by J. Cheney):\n\nDick Whittington was a poor orphan boy, languishing in Lancashire (B), or some unnamed place in the country (H, C). He set off to seek his fortune in London (B, H, C), enticed by the rumour that its streets were paved with gold (C). But he soon found himself cold and hungry, and fell asleep at the gate of the home of a wealthy merchant named Fitzwarren (H, C). Fitzwarren gave him lodging and hired him to be the scullion in the kitchen (B, H, C).\n\nIn the prose versions, an account of the Dick Whittington's cat subsequently follows, but in the ballad, it is preceded by Dick's flight and church bells episode.\n\nIn the prose legend, Dick is provided quarter at the Fitzwarrens' garret (room in the attic) (H, C), which was infested with rats and mice (H, C). But Dick owned a cat (B, H, C), that the prose versions say he had bought for a penny he earned by shining shoes (H, C). The cat controlled his rodent problem, which made her an indispensable companion.\n\nWhen Fitzwarren organized a trade expedition sending the merchant ship \"Unicorn\" (H), Dick's cat was \"ventured\" to this mission to be sold for profit abroad (B, H, C). The versions also differ regarding the circumstances: either Dick relinquished the cat of his own volition, hoping its sale in a foreign land might reap a \"store of gold\" towards the fulfillment of the omen of the bells (B), or, Dick was compelled to do so by Fitzwarren, who maintained a steadfast rule that everyone in his household should have some article of worth riding on the venture, with due dividends forthcoming from the proceeds (H, C).\n\nDick became disenchanted with the scullion's lot and attempted to flee, either because he received room and board only for his labours and was denied monetary wages (B), or because the kitchen maid (H) or female cook named Mrs. Cicely (C) abused and physically beat him beyond his tolerance. He ran as far away as Bunhill (H) or Holloway (C), where he heard \"London Bells\" (B), Bow bells (C), or the bells of \"Bow Church\" (H), that seemed to be telling him, \n<poem>\n\"Turn again Whittington, Lord Mayor of London\" (H).\n</poem>\nwhich persuaded him to retrace his steps. (The wording of the bells' message differ slightly according to the textual source).\n\nThe ship was driven off course to the Barbary Coast, where the Moorish king purchased the entire cargo for a load of gold, and insisted on entertaining the English traders with a feast. But the banquet was swarmed with rats and mice, whereby the English \"factor\" (business agent) informed their hosts that they were in possession of a creature which could exterminate these vermin (H, C). Thus Dick Whittington's cat was immediately put to the test, chasing and destroying the rodents. The Moors, even more pleased to learn that the cat was pregnant, paid more (H) (or ten times more (C)) for the cat than the rest of the cargo combined.\n\nThe ship returned to London and Fitzwarren who was apprised of the success of the venture (at his home on Leadenhall (H)), summoned the besmirched scullion Dick Whittington to the parlour (H) (or compting-room (C)) and sat him in a seat, addressing him in dignified fashion as Master (H) or Mr. Whittington. Dick was upset at first that this was being done in mockery, but Fitzwarren insisted it was all in earnest, explaining that the profits from the ship now made Dick a richer man than himself (C, H).\nDick married his former master's daughter Alice Fitzwarren (C, H), and joined his father-in-law in his business (H). In time, Whittington became the Lord Mayor of London three times, just as the bells had predicted. Whittington's acts of charity included the building of a college, a church (B, H, C), and Newgate Prison (B, H, C). He also burnt the bonds he owned, which the Crown had issued to fund the war (B, H).\n\nToday, on Highgate Hill in front of Whittington Hospital, there is a statue in honour of Whittington's legendary cat on the site where, according to late versions of the story, the distant Bow Bells beckoned young Dick back to London to claim his fortune. The cat statue was placed atop the Whittington Stone later, in 1964.\n\nThe site of the Whittington Stone lies within confines of \"Upper Holloway\" according to 19th century writers, which corresponds with some chapbooks that say the boy ran away to as far away as \"Holloway\".\n\nIt is not clear how far back this marker can be dated. Whittington biographer Lysons felt it stood there as a marker for \"many centuries\", even if it was actually just the debris of an old cross with only the plinth or base remaining, as some had suggested. Henry B. Wheatley argued that Whittington's association to \"Holloway\" must have been a later embellishment, as it is lacking in the early T. H. text (in which the boy only goes as far as Bunhill, just north of London). He thus does not think the stone could be dated anywhere near-contemporaneously to Whittington's lifespan, but he does allow that a purported stone was removed in 1795, so that the tradition at least predated the relocation of Whittington College to Highgate.\n\nWheatley also observed that Holloway was at such a distance that it would have been difficult for a child to have reached there by foot and returned the next morning. and that it was only barely within earshot of the bells of \"Bow Church\".\n\nThe earliest recorded instance of the folklore in written form is a registry notice dated 1604-5 for a theatrical play.\n\nThe drama \"The History of Richard Whittington, of his lowe byrth, his great fortune\" was licensed for the stage 1604–1605. Based on the only remaining evidence, which comes from the record at the Stationers' Registers, there is no proof beyond doubt whether the play accounted for Dick's rise from \"lowe birth\" by means of a cat, but it is considered likely, since a play from the contemporary period entitled \"Eastward Hoe\" (1605) makes an explicit cat association with the line: \"When the famous fable of Whittington and his puss shall be forgotten\". This line also stands as the earliest surviving literary reference of Whittington and his cat.\n\nA lost ballad is also known to have existed from the Stationers' Register of 1605. It records \"A ballad, called The vertuous Lyfe and memorable death of Sr Ri: Whittington mercer sometymes Lo. Maior of the honorable Citie of London\" licensed on 16 July 1605 to be printed by John Wright. The earliest surviving complete text of the legend in any form is the ballad written by Richard Johnson on the subject. The 17-octave piece, included in Johnson's \"Crowne Garland of Goulden Roses\" (1612), begins with the following lines:\n\"Here must I tell the praise / Of worthie Whittington...\"\n\nThis ballad of 1612 already contains the tradition that the hero made an attempt to flee his service as a scullion and headed towards \"his country\", but was persuaded to abort his flight when the London bells beckoned him back, seeming to tell him \"Whittington, back return\" and pronouncing the omen that he would eventually become Lord Mayor. The ballad goes on to tell how Whittington had a very humble past working as a kitchen scullion, but that he \"had a cat...And by it wealth he gat\". This ballad was sung to the tune of \"Dainty come thou to me\". Chappell prints the musical notation to a tune that accompanied the ballad of Richard Whittington, which he suggests may be the same one as \"Dainty\".\n\nOf intermediate date is a version entitled \"An Old Ballad of Whittington and his Cat,\" printed and sold in Aldermary Church Yard, London, dated 1750(?). A copy is owned by the Bodleian library (bequest of the Francis Douce collection), and in the U.S., by the Huntington Library and Yale University. These copies show the same woodcut illustrations. A later edition dated to 1773 was part of the Roxburghe Collection of Broadside Ballads.\n\nOther broadside ballad printings have been made into the 19th century. A version entitled \"London's Glory and Whittington's Renown; or, A Looking-Glass for Citizens of London\", printed for R. Burton at the Horse-Shoe, in West Smithfield, c. 1650, has been reprinted from the Roxburghe collection. Another is a broadside published in London by J. Pitts (between 1802 and 1819).\n\nThe story was also set in prose, especially in the form of common chapbooks.\n\n\"The Famous and Remarkable History of Sir Richard Whittington\" by \"T. H.\" (first edition, 1656) is the earliest extant chapbook version of the tale in the estimation of its editor Henry B. Wheatley. The author's identity is only given as \"T. H.\", but the work is ascribable to Thomas Heywood. Heywood certainly knew the cat story, for it is spoken of by the cast of characters in his play \"If You Know Not Me, You Know Nobody\" (1606).\n\nA number of other chapbook editions appeared, such as the one datable to 1730. Perhaps the latest chapbook example is \"The Adventures of Sir Richard Whittingon\", printed by J. Cheney, 1788–1808 which is quoted in full by Wheatley in his introduction. The later chapbooks contain embellishements such as London being a town with the reputation of being paved with gold, or the boy reaching Holloway, which is several times farther (than Bunhill).\n\nThe localization in Holloway or Highgate Hill that appeared in common chapbooks is not found in any early versions, and Wheatley believed it to be an 18th-century invention. Holloway is situated in a historically inconsistent direction since it lies up north, which contradicts the tradition that the boy was fleeing towards home; the real Whittington's place of origin being Gloucester, lying westward.\n\nThe artist George Cruikshank published an illustrated version of the story in about 1820. The American Joseph Jacobs printed a version that is a composite of three chapbook texts in his \"English Fairy Tales\" (1890).\n\nCynthia Harnett's \"Ring Out Bow Bells!\" (1953) is a retelling of the legend.\n\nThe story is only loosely based on the life of Richard Whittington. Although Alice Fitzwarren, Dick's love interest in the play, is named after the historical Richard Whittington's wife, the cat story cannot be traced to any early historical source, and there is insufficient evidence that Whittington ever owned a cat.\n\nIt is unknown how the cat story came to be attached to Whittington. Suggestions were made that the cat may be a corruption of the French \"achat\" meaning \"purchase\" (Henry Thomas Riley), or that it may come from the word \"cat\", another name for a coal-carrying boat which Whittington may have engaged in his business (Samuel Foote), but these explanations were downplayed as implausible by later commentators.\n\nThe Elstracke portrait of Whittington and his cat probably dates to around 1605, and does not predate the times of the earliest literary adaptations. But commentators have strived to demonstrate that various pieces of art and architecture might be allusions to the legend of \"Dick Whittington and His Cat\" that predate the early 1600s (See §Relics).\n\nAntiquarians have noticed similarities to foreign tales of medieval origin, which tells of a character who makes his fortune selling his cat abroad. The motif was later catalogued \"Whittington's cat\" (N411.2) in Stith Thompson's motif-index scheme.\n\nTwo Italian examples can be noted. One was told by Lorenzo Magalotti (d. 1732), regarding a 16th-century merchant Ansaldo degli Ormanni who made his fortune selling his cat to the king of the isle of Canary (Canaria). Another, the \"Novella delle Gatte\" (\"Tale of the she-cats\") told by Piovano Arlotto (d. 1484), was published in the collection of witticisms (\"Facetiae\") attributed to him.\n\nA similar tale is \"also found in a German chronicle of the thirteenth century\", but the tale is localized in Venice, Italy. Albert von Stade in his \"Chronicon Alberti Abbati Stadensis\", writing on the events in 1175, sidetracks into a legendary tale involving two early citizens of Venice. The rich man about to mount on a trade expedition offers to take a consignment of merchandise from the poor man (who could only afford 2 cats), and a great profit is realized to reward the poor friend. Keightley, who identified the tale as a parallel Whittington's, said the legend \"was apparently an old one in Italy\", although nothing was certain beyond it being known in the 13th century.\n\nA Persian story localized around Keish (Kish Island) tells of a certain widow's son who lived in the 10th century and made his fortune in India with his cat. This tale occurs in the \"Tarik al-Wasaf\" (\"Tārīkḣ-i Waṣṣāf\"), a 14th-century chronicle. The similarity was noted by James Morier, \"Second Journey\" (1818), and William Gore Ouseley, \"Travels\" (1819).\n\nA convenient source of the parallels is Keightley, who devoted Chapter VII of his \"Tales and Popular Fictions\" (1834) to the topic, boasting of the largest compilation of these parallels ever. though he was not the first to make note of the parallels in published form.\n\n\"Whittington and his Cat\" is listed as one of the analogues grouped under Grimms' tale KHM 70 \"\" (\"The Three Sons of Fortune\") in Bolte and Polívka's \"Anmerkungen\". The list organizes parallel folktales by different language (including Dutch and German printings of \"Whittington and his Cat\").\n\nAnother parallel could be found in Puss in Boots.\n\nIn modern folkloristics, tales with the same plot structure are classified under Aarne–Thompson (AT) tale type 1651 \"Whittington's Cat\". Examples of the tale type need not feature a cat, and the helper can be replaced by the angel St. Michael or St. Joseph.\n\nThe story has been adapted into puppet play, opera, dramatic play, and pantomime.\n\nThere is an early record of puppet performance of the legend, dating to Samuel Pepys's diary of 21 September 1668, which reads: \"To Southwark Fair, very dirty, and there saw the puppet show of Whittington, which was pretty to see\".\n\nAt Covent Garden, performances of \"Whittington and his Cat\" were put on by the puppeteer Martin Powell (fl. 1710–1729). Powell was a successful showman, providing such a draw that the parish church of St. Paul would be drained of its congregation during hours of prayer when his plays were on. An advertisement bill of the puppet show has been copied out in \"Groans of Great Britain\", once credited to Daniel Defoe but since reattributed to Charles Gildon (d. 1724), with a description of some of the many extraneously added characters and elements:\n\"At Punch's Theater in the Little Piazza, Covent-Garden, this present Evening will be performed an Entertainment, called, \"The History of Sir Richard Whittington\", shewing his Rise from a Scullion to be Lord-Mayor of London, with the Comical Humours of Old Madge, the jolly Chamber-maid, and the Representation of the Sea, and the Court of Great Britain, concluding with the Court of Aldermen, and \"Whittington Lord-Mayor\", honoured with the Presence of K. Hen. VIII. and his Queen Anna Bullen, with other diverting Decorations proper to the Play, beginning at 6 o' clock\".\nThe puppet play \"Whittington and his Cat\" was reviewed by an anonymous correspondent in \"The Spectator\", No. 14, dated 16 March 1711, soon after it opened. It featured Punch (of the Punch and Judy shows) as did all of Powell's puppet plays. Punch danced a minuet with a trained pig in the opening scene. Punch also gave his \"reflections on the French\" that was a breach of \"the Moral\", as was King Harry (Henry VIII) resting his leg on his queen in an immodest manner. Little else on the performance can be gleaned, except that the hero's role (i.e., Punch's role) was performed in a squeaky high voice, just like the lead of the Italian opera \"Rinaldo and Armida\", the rival draw at the time at Covent Garden which the anonymous reviewer was simultaneously critiquing. The reviewer concludes \"as the Wit of both pieces are equal, I must prefer...Mr Powell, because it is in our own language\".\n\nAn opera production that never came into realization was a topic in Joseph Addison's piece in \"The Spectator\" (1711). Addison states he was \"credibly informed that there was once a Design of casting into an Opera the Story of \"Whittington\" and his Cat, and that in order to it, there had been got together a great Quantity of Mice,\" but that Mr. Rich (Christopher Rich) who was proprietor of the playhouse (he managed several including Drury Lane theatre) objected that the rodents once released will not be thoroughly collected.\n\nLater \"Whittington and his Cat\", an opera written by Samuel Davey, was performed at the Theatre in Smock Alley, Dublin, 1739.\n\n\"Whittington\", with music by Jacques Offenbach and English text by H. B. Farnie was first produced at the Alhambra Theatre over Christmas 1874–75, and in 1895 the comic opera \"Dandy Dick Whittington\" written by George Robert Sims and composed by Ivan Caryll played at the Avenue Theatre.\n\nThe first recorded pantomime version of the story was in 1814, starring Joseph Grimaldi as Dame Cicely Suet, the Cook.\n\nElla Shields (Camden Theatre, 1907), Sybil Arundale (Theatre Royal, Birmingham, 1908), Helen Gilliland (Lyceum, 1925) are among the actresses who have played the principal boy. Cast in other productions are listed below.\n\nDick's cat has been given the names Thomas, Tommy, Tommy Tittlemouse (1890), or Mouser (1908). and so forth.\n\nThe pantomime has introduced an arch villain, the Pantomime King Rat (or King of Rats), as well as the usual pantomime fairy, the Fairy of the Bells, personifying the London bells. An early record of King Rat and fairy occurs in an 1877 production at Surrey Theatre. This production pitches the archvillain King Rat against the Fairy Queen, for whom the fairy Beau Bell serves as messenger. \"King Rataplan (Rat-a-plan)\" occurs even earlier, alongside \"Queen Olivebranch\" who assigns Cupid to uplift Dick Whittington from poverty, in a Charles Millward script for the Theatre Royal, Birmingham production of 1870. \n\nIn some versions, Dick and his cat Tommy travel to Morocco, where the cat rids the country of rats. The Sultan rewards Dick with half of his wealth.\n\nThe pantomime version remains popular today. Other notable pantomime productions included an 1877 version at the Surrey Theatre described below, as well as the following:\nDramatic play versions were written by H. J. Byron in 1861, Robert Reece in 1871.\n\nA number of television versions have been created, including a 2002 version written by Simon Nye and directed by Geoff Posner.\n\nThere are various pieces of art and architecture which have been used to try to date the Whittington association to earlier than the 1600s. The Elstracke engraving providing Whittington's portrait with a cat had been ascribed a c. 1590 date by some 19th century authors. A Newgate statue claiming to be Whittington's cat was actually a Libertas goddess statue, and though there were suggestions it was made by the executors of Whittington's will when they rebuilt the prison, the existence of the statues prior to the Great Fire of 1666 cannot be firmly established.\n\nOther relics are a relief tablet of a boy and animal said to be found at a home that belonged to the family, a chariot with a cat carving that was the gift of the family.\n\nA Whittington portrait painting depicting the mayor with a cat, allegedly dating to 1532, was once kept at the Mercers' Hall. The original has been lost, prompting Wheatley to remark that the disappeared artwork \"can scarcely be put in evidence\". However, a facsimile of it has been reproduced in engraving in \"The New Wonderful Museum\" (1805) edited by William Granger and James Caulfield (see image at top).\n\nThe portrait painting that did exist at Mercers' Hall, affixed with a 1536 date had been witnessed and described by James Peller Malcolm (d. 1815) in \"Londinium Redivivum\", Vol. 4 (1807). The painting was in the apartment of the clerk of Mercers' Company at Mercers' Hall. According to Malcolm, this portrait of Whittington's had \"on the left hand.. a black and white cat, whose right ear reaches up to the band or broad turning down to the shirt of the figure\". Malcolm admits that the 1536 date had been repainted at a later date after the canvas was cropped, but commented that \"it is hardly to be supposed\" that this date \"was then invented\".\n\nThis painting had disappeared by the time Rev. Samuel Lysons, who published the mayor's biography in 1860, requested a viewing of it Mercer's Hall. Another portrait was available for him to see, but it was more modern and did not correspond to Malcolm's descriptions. At Mercer's hall also had on display an engraved portrait of Whittington and his cat by Guillaume Philippe Benoist. The Benoist was published 1766, and according to the caption represents the Whittington and cat portrait then still hanging at Mercer's Hall.\n\nThere was also an early engraving by Reginald Elstrack (1570 – after 1625). This engraving, entitled the \"True Portraicture\" or \"Vera Effigies Preclarmi Domini Richardi Whittington Equi Aurat\" is reproduced in the inset of Lyson's work. The engraving cannot be definitely dated; Lysons noted that the printmaker flourished c. 1590, and this is the date assigned by Sir Walter Besant and James Rice, but other sources give a 1605 date. On the prints can be read \"R. Elstrack \"Sculpsit\"\" at bottom, which is truncated in Lysons's reproduction.\n\nIt has also been noted that the engraving originally depicted Whittington with a skull under his hand, but had been replaced with a cat underneath, to cater to public taste, \"as the common people did not care to buy the print without it\".\n\nThe antiquarian Thomas Pennant believed that a statue of Whittington with his cat was installed in a niche in Newgate) in 1412, by the executors of Whittington's estate, but that it was damaged in The Great Fire of 1666 and replaced. Lysons and others had lent some credance to this statement by Pennant. But much of Pennant's assumptions here have been subjected to corrections and refutations.\n\nThis \"assertion that a carved figure of a cat existed on Newgate gaol before the great fire is an unsupported assumption,\" or so it was pronounced by historian Charles Lethbridge Kingsford. Work on Newgate at Whittington's bequest did not commence during his lifetime in 1412, but in 1442. A copy of Whittington's will kept at Guildhall that prescribes this fails to mention a statue, or him and his cat.\n\nThis statue was actually the female Liberty (\"Libertas\" carved on the hat) with a cat at her feet, but it was \"alluding to\" Richard Whittington, as explained by Maitland. The stone Liberty was one of a set of seven, the others being Peace, Plenty, Concord, and Justice, Mercy, and Truth.\n\nThis Whittington statue (Liberty statue) was taken down when the old Newgate was being demolished, in 1766 or 1776, to be placed in the new Newgate Prison. The Liberty statue could later be seen at the new Newgate Prison, but the cat was not with her.\n\nAlso a chariot with a carved cat, purportedly presented by Whittington's heirs to the merchant's guild in 1572, was available for the biographer Samuel Lysons to examine.\n\nIt was purported that in 1862 at the site of a former residence of Whittington (in Gloucester), there was unearthed a piece of stone, possibly chimney stone, bearing a \"basso relievo\" of a boy holding a cat. It was allegedly of 15th-century workmanship. The relic came into the possession of Samuel Lysons. Besant and Rice called this \"remarkable proof\" that the cat story was in the family, but Wheatley thought \"this find, however, appears rather suspicious\". This artwork could have been acquired after the cat legend was established, as American folklorist Jennifer Westwood points out, and the supposed \"cat\" looked more like a lamb to others. The cat has been preserved at the Gloucester Folk Museum (now called Gloucester Life Museum), but taken off display.\n\n\n"}

The EAS was sponsored by the American Studies Association, which appointed an editorial board consisting of Johnnella Butler, Robert Gross, and Miles Orvell. (Robert Gross was replaced by Jay Mechling during the first year of planning.) The intent behind the EAS was to create a work that would serve the needs of scholars, graduate students, college students and a high school audience, a work that would be accessible yet authoritative and that would cover the range of American history and culture from an interdisciplinary perspective. Articles in the EAS range from the singular features of American material culture (e.g. the Statue of Liberty or Barbie Dolls) to the broadest concepts of American intellectual culture (e.g. Exceptionalism and Millennialism) as well as the methods and theories of American Studies.\n\nIn 2003 the EAS appeared in its initial online version, and in 2005 Johns Hopkins University Press took over as publisher, working with the American Studies Association, and making the EAS a regular benefit of membership in the ASA. Miles Orvell served as Editor in Chief of the online version until 2011 and organized an EAS Advisory Board appointed by the American Studies Association. In 2011, Simon J. Bronner, distinguished professor of American Studies at Pennsylvania State University, Harrisburg, took over the reins of the EAS as Editor in Chief.

{"id": "324872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324872", "title": "Ethnomathematics", "text": "Ethnomathematics\n\nIn mathematics education, ethnomathematics is the study of the relationship between mathematics and culture. Often associated with \"cultures without written expression\", it may also be defined as \"the mathematics which is practised among identifiable cultural groups\". It refers to a broad cluster of ideas ranging from distinct numerical and mathematical systems to multicultural mathematics education. The goal of ethnomathematics is to contribute both to the understanding of culture and the understanding of mathematics, and mainly to lead to an appreciation of the connections between the two.\n\nThe term \"ethnomathematics\" was introduced by the Brazilian educator and mathematician Ubiratàn D'Ambrosio in 1977 during a presentation for the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Since D'Ambrosio put forth the term, people - D'Ambrosio included - have struggled with its meaning (\"An etymological abuse leads me to use the words, respectively, \"ethno\" and \"mathema\" for their categories of analysis and \"tics\" from (from techne)\".).\n\nThe following is a sampling of some of the definitions of ethnomathematics proposed between 1985 and 2006:\n\n\nSome of the systems for representing numbers in previous and present cultures are well known. Roman numerals use a few letters of the alphabet to represent numbers up to the thousands, but are not intended for arbitrarily large numbers and can only represent positive integers. Arabic numerals are a family of systems, originating in India and passing to medieval Islamic civilization, then to Europe, and now standard in global culture—and having undergone many curious changes with time and geography—can represent arbitrarily large numbers and have been adapted to negative numbers, fractions, and real numbers.\n\nLess well known systems include some that are written and can be read today, such as the Hebrew and Greek method of using the letters of the alphabet, in order, for digits 1–9, tens 10–90, and hundreds 100–900.\n\nA completely different system is that of the quipu, which recorded numbers on knotted strings.\n\nEthnomathematicians are interested in the ways in which numeration systems grew up, as well as their similarities and differences and the reasons for them. The great variety in ways of representing numbers is especially intriguing.\n\nThis means the ways in which number words are formed.\n\nFor instance, in English, there are four different systems. The units words (one to nine) and ten are special. The next two are reduced forms of Anglo-Saxon \"one left over\" and \"two left over\" (i.e., after counting to ten). Multiples of ten from \"twenty\" to \"ninety\" are formed from the units words, one through nine, by a single pattern. Thirteen to nineteen, and in a slightly different way twenty-one through ninety-nine (excluding the tens words), are compounded from tens and units words. Larger numbers are also formed on a base of ten and its powers (\"hundred\" and \"thousand\"). One may suspect this is based on an ancient tradition of finger counting. Residues of ancient counting by 20s and 12s are the words \"score\", \"dozen\", and \"gross\". (Larger number words like \"million\" are not part of the original English system; they are scholarly creations based ultimately on Latin.)\n\nThe German language counts similarly to English, but the unit is placed first in numbers over 20. For example, \"26\" is \"sechsundzwanzig\", literally \"six and twenty\". This system was formerly common in English, as seen in an artifact from the English nursery rhyme \"Sing a Song of Sixpence\": \"Sing a song of sixpence, / a pocket full of rye. / Four and twenty blackbirds, / baked in a pie.\" It persists in some children's songs such as \"One and Twenty.\"\n\nIn the French language as used in France, one sees some differences. \"Soixante-dix\" (literally, \"sixty-ten\") is used for \"seventy\". The words \"quatre-vingt\" (literally, \"four-twenty\", or 80) and \"quatre-vingt-dix\" (literally, \"four-twenty ten\" 90) are based on 20 (\"vingt\") instead of 10. Swiss French and Belgian French do not use these forms, preferring more standard Latinate forms: \"septante\" for 70, \"octante\" for 80 and \"nonante\" for 90; In Swiss, they even replaced 80 with \"huitante\" (See the article ), which can date back to 12th century\n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, the base for constructing numbers was 60, with 10 used as an intermediate base for numbers below 60.\n\nMany West African languages base their number words on a combination of 5 and 20, derived from thinking of a complete hand or a complete set of digits comprising both fingers and toes. In fact, in some languages, the words for 5 and 20 refer to these body parts (e.g., a word for 20 that means \"man complete\"). The words for numbers below 20 are based on 5 and higher numbers combine the lower numbers with multiples and powers of 20. Of course, this description of hundreds of languages is badly oversimplified; better information and references can be found in Zaslavsky (1973).\n\nMany systems of finger counting have been, and still are, used in various parts of the world. Most are not as obvious as holding up a number of fingers. The position of fingers may be most important. One continuing use for finger counting is for people who speak different languages to communicate prices in the marketplace.\n\nIn contrast to finger counting, the Yuki people (indigenous Americans from Northern California) keep count by using the four spaces between their fingers rather than the fingers themselves. This is known as an octal (base-8) counting system.\n\nThis area of ethnomathematics mainly focuses on addressing Eurocentrism by countering the common belief that most worthwhile mathematics known and used today was developed in the Western world.\nThe area stresses that \"the history of mathematics has been oversimplified\",\nand seeks to explore the emergence of mathematics from various ages and civilizations throughout human history.\n\nD'Ambrosio's 1980 review of the evolution of mathematics, his 1985 appeal to include ethnomathematics in the history of mathematics and his 2002 paper about the historiographical approaches to non-Western mathematics are excellent examples. Additionally, Frankenstein and Powell's 1989 attempt to redefine mathematics from a non-eurocentric viewpoint and Anderson's 1990 concepts of world mathematics are strong contributions to this area. Detailed examinations of the history of the mathematical developments of non-European civilizations, such as the mathematics of ancient Japan, Iraq, Egypt, and of Islamic, Hebrew, and Incan civilizations, have also been presented.\n\nThe core of any debate about the cultural nature of mathematics will ultimately lead to an examination of the nature of mathematics itself. One of the oldest and most controversial topics in this area is whether mathematics is internal or external, tracing back to the arguments of Plato, an externalist, and Aristotle, an internalist. On the one hand, Internalists such as Bishop, Stigler and Baranes, believe mathematics to be a cultural product. On the other hand, externalists, like Barrow, Chevallard and Penrose, see mathematics as culture-free, and tend to be major critics of ethnomathematics. With disputes about the nature of mathematics, come questions about the nature of ethnomathematics, and the question of whether ethnomathematics is part of mathematics or not. Barton, who has offered the core of research about ethnomathematics and philosophy, asks whether \"ethnomathematics is a precursor, parallel body of knowledge or precolonized body of knowledge\" to mathematics and if it is even possible for us to identify all types of mathematics based on a Western-epistemological foundation.\n\nThe contributions in this area try to illuminate how mathematics has affected the nonacademic areas of society. One of the most controversial and provocative political components of ethnomathematics is its racial implications. Ethnomathematicians purport that the prefix \"ethno\" should not be taken as relating to race, but rather, the cultural traditions of groups of people. However, in places like South Africa concepts of culture, ethnicity and race are not only intertwined but carry strong, divisive negative connotations. So, although it may be made explicit that ethnomathematics is not a \"racist doctrine\" it is vulnerable to association with racism.\n\nAnother major facet of this area addresses the relationship between gender and mathematics. This looks at topics such as discrepancies between male and female math performance in educations and career-orientation, societal causes, women's contributions to mathematics research and development, etc.\n\nGerdes' writings about how mathematics can be used in the school systems of Mozambique and South Africa, and D'Ambrosio's 1990 discussion of the role mathematics plays in building a democratic and just society are examples of the impact mathematics can have on developing the identity of a society. In 1990, Bishop also writes about the powerful and dominating influence of Western mathematics. More specific examples of the political impact of mathematics are seen in Knijik's 1993 study of how Brazilian sugar cane farmers could be politically and economically armed with mathematics knowledge, and Osmond's analysis of an employer's perceived value of mathematics (2000).\n\nThe focus of this area is to introduce the mathematical ideas of people who have generally been excluded from discussions of formal, academic mathematics. The research of the mathematics of these cultures indicates two, slightly contradictory viewpoints. The first supports the objectivity of mathematics and that it is something discovered not constructed. The studies reveal that all cultures have basic counting, sorting and deciphering methods, and that these have arisen independently in different places around the world. This can be used to argue that these mathematical concepts are being discovered rather than created. However, others emphasize that the usefulness of mathematics is what tends to conceal its cultural constructs. Naturally, it is not surprising that extremely practical concepts such as numbers and counting have arisen in all cultures. The universality of these concepts, however, seems harder to sustain as more and more research reveals practices which are typically mathematical, such as counting, ordering, sorting, measuring and weighing, done in radically different ways (see Section 2.1: Numerals and Naming Systems).\n\nOne of the challenges faced by researchers in this area is the fact that they are limited by their own mathematical and cultural frameworks. The discussions of the mathematical ideas of other cultures recast these into a Western framework in order to identify and understand them. This raises the questions of how many mathematical ideas evade notice simply because they lack similar Western mathematical counterparts, and of how to draw the line classifying mathematical from non-mathematical ideas.\n\nThe majority of research in this area has been about the intuitive mathematical thinking of small-scale, traditional, indigenous cultures including: Aboriginal Australians, the indigenous people of Liberia, Native Americans in North America, Pacific Islanders, Brazilian construction foremen, and tribes in Africa.\n\nAn enormous variety of games that can be analyzed mathematically have been played around the world and through history. The interest of the ethnomathematician usually centers on the ways in which the game represents informal mathematical thought as part of ordinary society, but sometimes has extended to mathematical analyses of games. It does not include the careful analysis of good play—but it may include the social or mathematical aspects of such analysis.\n\nA mathematical game that is well known in European culture is tic-tac-toe (noughts-and-crosses). This is a geometrical game played on a 3-by-3 square; the goal is to form a straight line of three of the same symbol. There are many broadly similar games from all parts of England, to name only one country where they are found.\n\nAnother kind of geometrical game involves objects that move or jump over each other within a specific shape (a \"board\"). There may be captures. The goal may be to eliminate the opponent's pieces, or simply to form a certain configuration, e.g., to arrange the objects according to a rule. One such game is Nine Men's Morris; it has innumerable relatives where the board or setup or moves may vary, sometimes drastically. This kind of game is well suited to play out of doors with stones on the dirt, though now it may use plastic pieces on a paper or wooden board.\n\nA mathematical game found in West Africa is to draw a certain figure by a line that never ends until it closes the figure by reaching the starting point (in mathematical terminology, this is a Eulerian path on a graph). Children use sticks to draw these in the dirt or sand, and of course the game can be played with pen and paper.\n\nThe games of checkers, chess, oware (and other mancala games), and Go may also be viewed as subjects for ethnomathematics.\n\nOne way mathematics appears in art is through symmetries. Woven designs in cloth or carpets (to name two) commonly have some kind of symmetrical arrangement. A rectangular carpet often has rectangular symmetry in the overall pattern. A woven cloth may exhibit one of the seventeen kinds of plane symmetry groups; see Crowe (2004) for an illustrated mathematical study of African weaving patterns. Several types of patterns discovered by ethnomathematical communities are related to technologies; see Berczi (2002) about illustrated mathematical study of patterns and symmetry in Eurasia. Following the analysis of Indonesian folk weaving patterns and Batak traditional architectural ornaments, the geometry of Indonesian traditional motifs of batik is analyzed by Hokky Situngkir that eventually made a new genre of fractal batik designs as generative art; see Situngkir and Surya (2007) for implementations.\n\nEthnomathematics and mathematics education addresses first, how cultural values can affect teaching, learning and curriculum, and second, how mathematics education can then affect the political and social dynamics of a culture. One of the stances taken by many educators is that it is crucial to acknowledge the cultural context of mathematics students by teaching culturally based mathematics that students can relate to. Can teaching math through cultural relevance and personal experiences help the learners know more about reality, culture, society and themselves? Robert (2006)\n\nAnother approach suggested by mathematics educators is exposing students to the mathematics of a variety of different cultural contexts, often referred to as multicultural math. This can be used both to increase the social awareness of students and offer alternative methods of approaching conventional mathematics operations, like multiplication.(Andrew, 2005)\n\nVarious mathematics educators have explored ways of bringing together culture and mathematics in the classroom, such as: Barber and Estrin (1995) and Bradley (1984) on Native American education, Gerdes (1988b and 2001) with suggestions for using African art and games, Malloy (1997) about African American students and Flores (1997), who developed instructional strategies for Hispanic students.\n\nSome critics claim that mathematics education in some countries, including the United States, unduly emphasizes ethnomathematics in order to promote multiculturalism while spending too little time on core mathematical content, and that this often results in pseudoscience being taught. An example of this criticism is an article by Marianne M. Jennings. Another example is Richard Askey, who accuses \"Focus on Algebra\", the same Addison-Wesley textbook criticized by Marianne M. Jennings, of teaching pseudoscience, claiming for South Sea islanders mystic knowledge of astronomy more advanced than scientific knowledge.\n\n\n"}

Syuzhet is an employment of narrative and fabula is the chronological order of the events contained in the story. They were first used in this sense by Vladimir Propp and Viktor Shklovsky.\n\nThe fabula is \"the raw material of a story\", and syuzhet is \"the way a story is organized\". Since Aristotle's \"Poetics\", narrative plots are supposed to have a beginning, middle and end. This is often achieved in film and novels via flashbacks or flashforwards. For example, the film \"Citizen Kane\" starts with the death of the main character, and then tells his life through flashbacks interspersed with a journalist's present-time investigation of Kane's life. The fabula of the film is the actual story of Kane's life the way it happened in chronological order, while the syuzhet is the way the story is told throughout the movie, including flashbacks.\n\nJonathan Culler in \"The Pursuit of Signs: Semiotics, Literature, Deconstruction\" (1981) notes a certain contradiction in assigning priority to either fabula or syuzhet (170-172). The operative assumption amongst many literary critics is that fabula precedes the syuzhet, which provides one of many ways of rendering what took place in the story. Culler argues that one can also understand fabula as a production of the syuzhet, whereby certain events are created and ordered at the level of story in order to produce a meaningful narrative. Critics, he argues, subscribe to a view in which fabula precedes syuzhet when debating the significance of a character's actions, but adopt the opposite view when they discuss the \"appropriateness\" of a narrative's ending (178). \n\nJacques Derrida (1979) is also critical of the logocentric hierarchic ordering of syuzhet and fabula. He raises the question, \"What if there are story ways of telling as well as narrative ways of telling? And if so, how is it that narrative in the American-European tradition has become privileged over story?\" One answer is that narrative is both syuzhet (employment) and a subjection of fabula (the stuff of story, represented through narrative). For example, Derrida views narrative as having a terrible secret, in its way of oppressing story:\n\nThe question-of-narrative covers, with a certain modesty, a demand for narrative, a violent putting-to-the-question, an instrument of torture working to wring out the narrative as if it were a terrible secret, in ways that can go from the most archaic police methods to refinements for making (and even letting) one talk unsurpassed in neutrality and politeness, most respectfully medical, psychiatric, and even psychoanalytic. (Derrida, 1979: 94).\n\nIf story is more than fabula, dominated by narrative, it could have its own manner of discourse, rather than being subordinate to narrative. Derrida plays with just such an idea as follows in setting story in relation to its homonym:\n\nEach \"story\" (and each occurrence of the word \"story\", each \"story\" in the story) is part of the other, makes the other part (of itself), each \"story\" is at once larger and smaller than itself, includes itself without including (or comprehending) itself, identifies itself with itself even as it remains utterly different from its homonym. (Derrida, 1979: 99-100).\n\nJerome Bruner also raises issues about fabula and syuzhet. He summarizes syuzhet as the plot of narrative, and fabula as a timeless underlying theme (Bruner, 1986, pp. 7, 17-21). Bruner wants fabula to be a little more \"loose fitting a constraint\" on story: \"I think we would do well with as loose fitting a constraint as we can manage concerning what a story must 'be' to be a story\" (p. 17).\n\nThe problem for Bruner is to explore the underlying narrative structures (syuzhets) in not only Russian formalism, but also French Structuralism (Roland Barthes, Tzvetan Todorov and others). The European formalists posit narrative grammars (i.e. Todorov's simple transformations of mode, intention, result, manner, aspect and status, as well as complex transformations of appearance, knowledge, supposition, description, subjectification and attitude). For Bruner, the story (fabula stuff) becomes the \"virtual text\" (p. 32) to the narrative grammars. \"Nevertheless, Shotter suggests that Bruner failed to engage these 'particularities of otherness' in favour of abstractive explanation of meaning-making processes rather than in a description of dialogical performances\" (Mos, 2003: 2). In other words, there is a need to consider how narrative pursues grammars and abstract meaning frames, whereas story can be dialogic and in the web of the social.\n\nMikhail Bakhtin is also not convinced that fabula and syuzhet is a complete explanation of the relationship of narrative and story. Like Derrida, he is suspicious of the hegemony of narrative over story.\n\nFor Bakhtin (1973: 12) \"narrative genres are always enclosed in a solid and unshakable monological framework.\" Story, for Bakhtin, is decidedly more dialogue-based, for example in the \"polyphonic manner of the story\" (Bakhtin, 1973: 60).\n\nBenjamin Whorf (1956: 256), following up an observation by Franz Boas, contended that the Hopi Indians do not experience themselves, or life as narrative grammar, or pattern. Rather than past-present-future, as segregated syuzhet, the Hopi experience is one of \"eventing.\" Shotter (1993: 109) refers to Whorf's \"eventing\" and to the Hopi's differences with Euro-American space and time.\n\n\n\n"}

The group entertained audiences at NBA and college basketball games in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia.\n\nBy 1990 Cobb had relocated to rural Fair Grove, Missouri where he was inspired by a documentary of Jackson Pollock and began working with sheet metal and locust tree thorns. His first painting titled, \"Down in the Valley of Rural Violence\" was an examination of the 1987 James Schnick massacre at Elkland, Missouri.\n\nIn 1993 Cobb moved to Memphis and began painting again. His work was first exhibited in the lobby of the Memphis \"Commercial Appeal's\" newspaper office. Cobb donated paintings to raise funds for WKNO Public Television and the Memphis Orpheum Theater and other works to hospitals and mental institutions. Cobb has donated more than 60 paintings to not-for-profit organizations and museums throughout the region. In 2003 Cobb was invited to Nashville to view his paintings on permanent display at the Tennessee State Capitol building and the Tennessee State Museum.\n\nIn 2004 Cobb began experimenting with \"visual color blending\" in his paintings and he created a series of paintings for the sight impaired and the blind. Cobb incorporated thick textures onto the surface of his paintings by squeezing the paints onto the canvas. By 2005 he had completed a series of \"Braille paintings\" designed to be touched and interpreted by the blind. One of these paintings was used as a subject for the University of Missouri's Museum of Art & Archeology's 2009 Art In Bloom event.\n\nArt critics John Simmons and Camille Howell wrote: \"Down in the Valley of Rural Violence is typical of what Cobb calls his 'thorn paintings'...His use of tortured metal, abstract forms and an overlay of projecting thorns all combine in this and the other paintings in the series to produce statements of anger and frustration\". \"Guy Cobb is an artist worth watching.

The designation of a site as a Local Historic Place does not impose any restrictions or obligations on the owner of the property.\n\nThe Heritage Conservation Act received Royal Assent on February 26, 2010. It replaced and repealed the Historic Sites Protection Act of 1973 and the Municipal Heritage Preservation Act of 1978. A site that had been designated as an historic or anthropological site under the former Historic Sites Protection Act is deemed to be a Provincial Heritage Place under the new statute, while a by-law establishing a Municipal Heritage Conservation Area under the former Municipal Heritage Preservation Act is deemed to continue to be in force under the new legislation.\n\nSection 5 of the Heritage Conservation Act establishes that the provincial Crown has ownership of all \"archaeological, palaeontological and burial site heritage objects in New Brunswick\". If the object is of Aboriginal origin it is to be 'held in trust' on behalf of the Aboriginal communities.\n\nThe Act provides guidelines and standards on how professional research is to be conducted, and how the management of objects is to be done. There are also guidelines regarding how amateur researchers can participate and gain approval for specific type of heritage exploration. Included in the Act is a clause that enforces the mandatory reporting of all possible discoveries of heritage objects to the provincial authority. It outlines regulations of heritage impact assessment, and \"prohibits the alteration of any heritage place in the Province without specific government approval\".\n\nIn New Brunswick, burial grounds are mainly covered under the Cemetery Companies Act. However, the Heritage Conservation Act protects places that have been used in the past for the placement of human remains or related objects, including old family plots, ancient burial grounds and abandoned cemeteries. A \"burial ground\" is defined in the heritage legislation as any place containing human remains and/or their associated objects. The discovery of such a site must be reported to the Heritage Branch of the Department of Tourism, Heritage and Culture as soon as possible specifying the location, and date and time it is discovered. Upon this reporting it will be reviewed by the Minister who will then make a decision as to whether or not to implement procedures to the protect the site.

From 2010 to 2016, he was the Deputy Commissioner for Foods at the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nTaylor received a B.A. degree in political science from Davidson College and a law degree from the University of Virginia. In 1976, after passing the bar examination, he became a staff attorney for the Food and Drug Administration, where he was executive assistant to the FDA Commissioner.\n\nFrom 1981 - 1991 Taylor worked in private law practice at King & Spalding, one client of which was the biotechnology company Monsanto. He established and led the firm's food and drug law practice.\n\nIn 1988 he published an article entitled \"The De Minimis Interpretation of the Delaney Clause: Legal and Policy Rationale\" in the Journal of the American College of Toxicology (now called the International Journal of Toxicology), which he had previously presented in December 1986 at a symposium on Topics in Risk Analysis, sponsored by International Life Sciences Institute Risk Science Institute, Society for Risk Analysis, and Brookings Institution. The paper was delivered and published during the midst of a debate and litigation over federal agencies' interpretation of the Delaney clause, a part of a 1958 federal law that prohibits any carcinogenic chemical from being added, in any amount, to food that is processed. As analytical instrumentation increased in power and more agents were found to be carcinogenic at very low levels, the agencies had developed a quantitative risk assessment approach to interpreting the Delaney Clause, which stated that if a carcinogen was present at levels less than 1 in 1,000,000 parts (1ppm), the risk of that carcinogen was \"de minimis\", and it could be allowed on the market. In his article, Taylor presented arguments in favor of this approach. Advocates in favor of organic food have criticized Taylor for taking this stance and have attributed the stance not to a good faith effort to reasonably regulate, but to an alleged desire to benefit Monsanto financially.\n\nOn July 17, 1991, Michael Taylor left King & Spalding for the FDA, accepting the newly created post of 'Deputy Commissioner for Policy'. \nIn 1992, he signed a guidance that milk from cows treated with BGH did not have to be labeled as such. \nHis name is not on the FDA's May 1992 guidance on genetically modified (GM) plant foods, but he is said to have been a co-author. Both documents are part of a regulatory framework developed since the mid-1980s under the Reagan and Bush Administrations to ensure the public's safety and development of the fledgling biotechnology industry without overly burdensome regulation. The guidance had three tenets: \"(1) U.S. policy would focus on the product of GM techniques, not the process itself, (2) only regulation grounded in verifiable scientific risks would be tolerated, and (3) GM products are on a continuum with existing products and, therefore, existing statutes are sufficient to review the products.\" \nThese tenets were first described in the 'Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology', published by the President's Domestic Policy Council Working Group on Biotechnology through the Office of Science and Technology Policy in 1986. The 1992 guidance, for example, treats \"transferred genetic material and the intended expression product or products\" in food derived from GM crops as food additives subject to existing food additive regulation, under which that material may be considered either generally recognized as safe (GRAS) or not GRAS, initially at the producer's determination. If the food additive is not GRAS, the producer is required to submit data proving that the food additive does not \"adulterate\" the food - in other words, that the additive is not injurious to health. With respect to GM food, the FDA retained its ability to take enforcement action any food it found to be \"adulterated\", which would make its producer \"subject to the full range of enforcement measures under the act, including seizure, injunction, and criminal prosecution of those who fail to meet their statutory duty.\"\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996 Taylor moved to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), where he was Administrator of the Food Safety & Inspection Service. During that term he implemented a science-based approach called Hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) to raising safety standards for meat and poultry production over the protests from industry, which food safety advocates have called \"a truly heroic accomplishment\".\n\nIn February, 1994 anti-biotechnology activist Jeremy Rifkin charged that Taylor had a conflict of interest with respect to the approval of rBST. The FDA replied that Taylor had recused himself from all but the final stages of the review. The Washington Post reported that: \"On March 15, FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler sent Rifkin a four-page letter stating that 'none of the activities of Mr. Taylor cited in your petition were in violation of any applicable law or regulation, or were otherwise inappropriate... I believe that Mr. Taylor's behavior adhered to all applicable ethical standards.' Kessler said that Taylor had not been 'intimately' involved in Monsanto's efforts to obtain approval, as Rifkin charged, and that he was involved in the FDA's bST policy only in the final stages of review. Kessler attached a nine-page memo by FDA ethics official Jack M. Kress supporting that position. Upon arriving at the FDA in the summer of 1991, Taylor recused himself for one year from taking part in any agency action dealing directly with Monsanto or any other King and Spalding clients.\" It also reported that \"Some longtime agency critics found the charges against Taylor misplaced, like Sidney Wolfe, a physician who heads the Public Citizen Health Research Group and has filed complaints with the FDA about revolving-door ethics issues concerning other officials.\"\n\nBetween 1996 and 2000, after briefly returning to King & Spalding, Taylor worked for Monsanto as a Vice President for Public Policy.\n\nIn 1999, a lawsuit (Alliance For Bio-Integrity v. Shalala) and GAO report revealed considerable disagreement within the FDA concerning decisions about biotechnology products made during Taylor's tenure. The lawsuit and report also said that Taylor had recused himself from matters related to Monsanto's BGH and had \"never sought to influence the thrust or content\" of the agency's policies on Monsanto's products.\n\nIn June 2000, he joined the think tank Resources for the Future (RFF) in the position of Senior Fellow and Director of RFF's Center for Risk Management, where he published two documents on U.S. aid for African agriculture, both of which were funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. During this time he was also a Director at 'Resolve', a nonprofit environmental and public health mediation and dispute resolution organization, and was an adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center.\n\nDuring this time, Taylor made strong arguments for a more rigorous and unified approach to food safety, in which he argued for:\n\n\nTaylor has been a professor at the University of Maryland's School of Medicine. In 2007, he became a Research Professor of Health Policy at the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services.\n\nOn July 7, 2009, Taylor returned to government as Senior Advisor to the FDA Commissioner. On January 13, 2010, he was appointed to another newly created post at the FDA, Deputy Commissioner for Foods.

The sole is soft and flexible and the upper part often is adorned with embroidery or beading. Though sometimes worn inside, it is chiefly intended for outdoor use. Historically, it is the footwear of many indigenous people of North America; moreover, hunters, traders, and European settlers wore them. Etymologically, the \"moccasin\" derives from the Algonquian language Powhatan word \"makasin\" (cognate to Massachusett \"mohkisson\" / \"mokussin\", Ojibwa \"makizin\", Mi'kmaq \"mksɨn\"), and from the Proto-Algonquian word *\"maxkeseni\" (shoe).\n\nIn the 1800s, moccasins usually were part of a Canadian regalia, e.g. a powwow suit of clothes. The most common style is that of the Plains Indians moccasin.\n\nMoccasins protect the foot while allowing the wearer to feel the ground. The Plains Indians wore hard-sole moccasins, given that their territorial geography featured rock and cacti. The eastern Indian tribes wore soft-sole moccasins, for walking in leaf-covered forest ground. Moccasins are usually all brown, the same color.\n\nIn New Zealand and Australia, sheep shearers' moccasins are constructed of a synthetic, cream-colored felt, with a back seam and gathered at the top of the rounded toe. These moccasins are laced in the front, and the lacing is covered with a flap fastened with a buckle at the shoe's outer side. The fastener arrangement prevents the shearer's handpiece comb from catching in the laces. Shearers' moccasins protect the feet, grip wooden floors well, and absorb sweat.\n\nThe word \"moccasin\" can also denote a shoe of deer leather adorned with laces.\n\nA \"driving moccasin\" (driving moc) is a contemporary version of the traditional Native American moccasin with the addition of rubber tabs on the sole. The addition of rubber-pad sole adds to the versatility and longevity of the shoe while maintaining the flexibility and comfort of a traditional moccasin. They were invented for men who wanted extra grip while driving. There are two variations of the sole including:\n\nMoc Toe Boots, commonly referred as a \"Moc Toe\", the boots are normally combined with hard rubber compounded soles. The moccasin toe work boot is a style that reflects the Native American moccasin. Normally by weld stitching two pieces of leather or fabric, the pattern creates a U-shaped design around the toe box.\n\n"}

According to Charanis himself, during his stay in Brussels, he acquired a profound interest in the Armenians. That interest bore abundant fruit in various studies, notably \"The Armenians in the Byzantine Empire\" (Byzantinoslavica, 1961) and \"A Note on the Ethnic Origin of Emperor Maurice\" (Byzantion, 1965).\n\nCharanis also spent some time at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece, and upon his return to the United States joined the Rutgers faculty in 1938, becoming Voorhees Professor of History in 1963. At that time, Byzantine Studies was still at its infancy in the United States. Charanis persuaded the history department to begin a course in Byzantine Studies, which eventually became one of the most popular courses at Rutgers. From 1964 to 1966, he served as chairman of the university's history department. He retired in 1976.\n\n"}

May is coolly scrutinizing the viewer, her other hand on her hip, with her trousers unbuttoned such that her pubic hair is visible. McCall's intention in painting May was to explore \"how women choose to express their sexual identity beyond the male gaze\".\n\nThe painting received public attention after the Mall Galleries removed it from the Society of Women Artists's annual exhibition in 2014, after which it was replaced with another nude portrait. According to a statement by the Galleries, this was done because of \"a number of complaints regarding the depiction of the subject and taking account of its location en route for children to our learning centre\", and, according to McCall, because the painting had been deemed \"disgusting\" and \"pornographic\". Writing in \"The Guardian\", Rowan Pelling interpreted this reaction as implying that \"the minute a woman is alive and free to move, an active agent of her own sexuality, she is a menace to society\", whereas Mall Galleries viewers appeared to feel more comfortable with a nude woman who is a \"more passive and unthreatening recipient of the wandering viewer's gaze\". In response to the removal of the work, McCall started a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #eroticcensorship.\n"}

(distribution under RONA brand) is a Slovak drinking glass manufacturer, established in Lednické Rovne, Slovakia, in 1892. The name RONA comes from the former naming of the village ‘‘Lednicz Rone’’. The company manufactures unleaded drinking glasses, known as crystal glass. 96% of production is exported and is available in more than 80 countries worldwide. The yearly production of the company exceeds 60 million pieces (2016). Product segments include households, the gastronomy business, aerospace, and ship catering.\n\nProducts of the company can be found at Buckingham palace and the White House. RONA created also a gift set for the football club Manchester United designed for fan shops in 2006. At the turn of 2008 and 2009, the company created and manufactured sets for fans of FC Barcelona, composed of stemware for champagne, red and white wines and carafes. The glass from Lednické Rovne can be found in the New York Rockefeller center's Rainbow Room, and in luxury hotels in Dubai and Las Vegas. The glass from the RONA company is supplied to airlines including: Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad, KLM, and American Airlines. Relief stemware set named Harmony was presented in an American sitcom from the world of young physicists, The Big Bang Theory.\n\nThe main manufacturing programs of the glassworks: \n\nAn entrepreneur Jozef Schreiber founded the company in 1892 as the last and the biggest glassworks of Vienna’s company Schreiber und Neffen, who had the most modern equipment of the time. The company in Lednické Rovne is the most successful Slovak glassworks and the only one left (2017).\n\nIt started by the manufacturing of flat glass, later pressed glass under Kaiserkristall brand that the company established as the first in Austria-Hungary. This was popular at the turn of the century for price and the fact that it imitated products of luxury cut lead glass. The goods were sold under the name ’’Imperial Crystal’’. Besides the pressed glass was manufactured hand blown glass under RONA Crystal brand focused on drinking glass and sets for hotels, medical institutions, cafes… as well as domestic glass for a household.\n\nBesides clear glass, the glassworks is known for its decoration techniques such as cutting, engraving, guilloche, painting, spraying, screen printing, tampoprint (an automatic calibration by laser), and pantograph technology. The company in Lednické Rovne established pantographs of English production as the first in Europe in 1896. In the 1940s, the company cooperated in the development of decors with professional designers Vincent Hložník and Martin Benka.\nArchived collections show products from the beginning that were decorated, full-colour pieces, along with functional designs of clear, plain glass. These lines were developed by patenting of a new handmade technology. Pulled stem, even more in 1956 than currently, is an indicator of glass products from Lednické Rovne.\n\nThe history and production of the company was documented by many specialists in their publications; historians and publicists such as Jan Bárta, Ján Mondok, Eduard Toran, Igor Didov, Karol Hetteš, Jindra Bakošová, Agáta Žáčková, Jarmila Račeková and others. Likewise articles in special magazines such as Glasrevue, Sklář a keramik, Sklárske rozhledy, Umení a remesla, Arte Regalo(Spanish magazine), Tableware International, Offrir International, and Casastile (Italian magazine).\n\nThe company over time has transitioned into and out of socialism, emerging in 1990 to become an exporter in 1992.\n\nThe development of glass production in Lednické Rovne went through many organizational changes, the company overcame many crisis periods of that time and the great program and focused production such as pressed glass, cylinders for lamps, technique and laboratory glass, light bulbs, feeding bottles… changed quite often and it gained the recognition as a producer mostly quality drinking glass at the beginning of 20th century. This program is a representative article of the company to the present when the proportion of hand made and machine production was changed as well as decoration glass. From the half of 60’s of the 20th century, the company focused mainly on a gradual introduction of machinery and automatic production of glass.\n\nWithin scientific research activities, the company closely works with domestic and foreign institutions which do activities focused on the glass area.\n\nThe Slovak Glass Museum, founded in 1988, connects the modern glassworks with its historical roots. The headquarters of the museum is a castle that was the former residence of founders of the company, reconstructed at the end of the 1980s. Today, it is used as a product showroom and administrative center, and it is used to host a biennial international glass symposium.\n\nThe history of the company's production at Lednické Rovne is documented by various collections, saved in deposits of galleries and museums such as Slovak National Museum - Historical Museum in Bratislava, Central Slovakia Museum in Banská Bystrica, Slovak National Museum - Ethnographical museum in Martin, Slovak National Gallery in Bratislava, Museum of Decorative Arts in Prague, and Corning Museum of Glass in New York.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "203753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203753", "title": "Swampman", "text": "Swampman\n\nSwampman is the subject of a philosophical thought experiment introduced by Donald Davidson in his 1987 paper \"Knowing One's Own Mind\".\n\nThe experiment runs as follows:\n\nDavidson holds that there would nevertheless be a difference, though no one would notice it. Swampman will appear to recognize Davidson's friends, but it is impossible for him to actually recognize them, as he has never seen them before. As Davidson puts it, \"It can't recognize anything, because it never cognized anything in the first place.\"\n\nThese considerations lead Davidson to deny that the Swampman's utterances can be construed as referring to anything in particular. To take a fairly specific example, suppose that at some point the previous day Davidson had looked at a glass marble on a shelf; unbeknownst to him there was another, visually identical, glass marble hidden right behind it. When he makes an assertion about \"the marble I saw yesterday\", we take him to be referring to the one that he did in fact see, even if he could not supply enough descriptive information to identify it later. Had the marbles been arranged in the other order, therefore, we would take him to be referring to the other marble, yet his internal state would be identical.\n\nThe Swampman has no causal history. He is in the same state as the actual Davidson and the counterfactual Davidson considered above, whose utterances refer to different marbles. As a result, \"his\" utterance could refer to either marble. In principle, Davidson tells us, the above indeterminacies can be extended to any degree we like: the fact that the Swampman happens to be identical to Davidson does not change the fact that he could have arrived at that state by any one of countless histories, each of which would demand we interpret him differently. Until the Swampman has begun interacting with and using language among the objects of the real world, we can have no grounds to attributing any meanings or thoughts to him at all.\n\nAmongst those who accept the force of this argument, there are two distinct ways of viewing its consequences. On the one hand, many philosophers have taken it to affect merely how we should evaluate Swampman. The argument is believed to demonstrate that Swampman's utterances and thoughts do not mean anything, and do not refer to anything in particular. On this view, Swampman's subjectivity and consciousness are considered to be unchanged. Others have argued that this lack of a causal history renders incoherent the notion that Swampman could have a mind at all, which in turn raises the question of whether he is, in fact, a person (note that Davidson calls Swampman \"it\" rather than \"he\").\n\nThis argument depends upon the acceptance of semantic externalism, the claim that the meaning of one's words is determined not merely by some internal state, but also by the causal history of the speaker.\n\nDavidson holds that there would \"nevertheless be a difference\", though no one would notice it. However he did not provide further elaboration and justification for the assertion. Objectors hold that there would be no difference.\n\nOne point of objection is that Davidson and the Swampman become individuals in their own rights immediately when they make choices of their own. Regardless of their physical make-up, neither can be defined in any way as individuals until their choices are considered. Thus, the two are only identical people insofar as they make their own choices, which is something that the thought experiment does not consider.\n\nDaniel Dennett, in \"Consciousness Explained\", has called into question the validity of this sort of thought experiment altogether, maintaining that when a thought experiment is too far removed from the actual state of affairs, our intuitions cease to be meaningful.\n\nThis concept has been said to have implications for mind uploading or mind transference, as it indirectly addresses the question of whether an exact replica of one's brain patterns, created within an alternative brain, an android brain, or a virtual universe, is the same being as the person it was copied from, or another being entirely. The same question is to be considered if a technology to teleport people arises.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5634296", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5634296", "title": "Teen Dance Ordinance", "text": "Teen Dance Ordinance\n\nThe Teen Dance Ordinance was a controversial Seattle law which severely curtailed the ability of concert and club promoters to hold events for underaged patrons. During its existence from 1985 to 2002, it was routinely criticized for its severity (often labeled \"draconian\") and its effects on the local music scene and industry. After several unsuccessful attempts to repeal it through lobbying and later court action, it was finally repealed and replaced with the All-ages Dance Ordinance.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1985, teen dances were unregulated in Seattle. Activities at underage clubs were attracting the attention of the public and a club called The Monastery was particularly notorious for allegations of sexual abuse, child prostitution, and drug and alcohol use. The Monastery was run by George Freeman and was ostensibly a non-profit church of the Universal Life Church, whose dance events were \"religious services\". During daytime hours it was a youth center that attracted runaways and homeless youth. The Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO) was conceived and passed the City Council on July 29, 1985 to stop abuses at underage clubs. It was amended in 1988. Key among its provisions were:\n\n\nWith these requirements, teen dances outside of schools were virtually banned in the city, as no promoter would undertake the costs involved. For a city the size of Seattle, shows that would only allow 15- to 20-year-olds could not draw a large enough crowd for the event to break even. In addition to the $1 million insurance bond, hiring off-duty officers was a huge expense. The non-profit exemption meant the ordinance did not apply to the Monastery; it was closed using pre-existing civil abatement laws. In the 15 years of the ordinance, almost no one applied for a promoter's license for youth events, and no one has been prosecuted with it.\n\nWhile the ordinance only regulated \"dances,\" the distinction between a concert and a dance was not outlined by law, and the police were accused of defining a dance so liberally that the dancing done in the audience of a concert was enough to qualify the entire event as a \"dance.\" All-ages concerts were thus subject to being shut down by police who were vigilant in making sure promoters did not skirt the law. As a result, some nationally touring acts refused to do shows in Seattle because they insisted on all-ages audiences. With Seattle becoming an epicenter for alternative rock and the grunge scene in the early 90's, teens had to go to neighboring cities to attend concerts and dances.\n\nProponents of the TDO said that the ordinance ensured the safety of underage patrons and discouraged gatherings where youth consumed drugs and alcohol. They also invoked the memory of the Monastery, where they said adults preyed upon vulnerable kids susceptible to offers of drugs or quick cash. Excluding adults from underage youth would, in their eyes, create a \"bubble of safety.\"\n\nThe repeal of the ordinance was a key goal of JAMPAC, a musicians' and promoters' political action committee founded by Krist Novoselic of Nirvana. Since its founding in 1995, the group lobbied the City Council to repeal the TDO.\n\nThe ordinance was a focal point for a vocal young activist community in Seattle, notably those consolidated as The All Ages Music Organization, and later by the Music and Youth Task Force, which allowed for youth and public officials to meet regularly to find resolution to conflicting points of view.\n\nA new ordinance proposed to replace the TDO was passed by the City Council in 2000, however it was quickly vetoed by Mayor Paul Schell. The veto caused JAMPAC to launch a suit against the City of Seattle, claiming that the TDO's virtual outlawing of dance infringed on the First Amendment right to free expression. A judge however ruled for the City on JAMPAC's suit in May 2002, claiming there was no infringement on the First Amendment and that the matter is a political one for the Council to decide, not the courts. Nevertheless, during the course of the suit, Schell was voted out of office (in the aftermath of the disastrous WTO meetings of 1999) and the new mayor Greg Nickels, a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Council. The new All-ages Dance Ordinance, written by members of the Music and Youth Task Force, was passed on August 12, 2002, replacing the TDO.\n\nThe new provisions of the All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) eased on restrictions to accommodate new youth events. They include:\n\nThe new rules, while more liberal than before, still disappointed many activists who pushed for the TDO's repeal. They viewed the new ordinance as only moderate changes to the rules and not liberal enough to actually encourage all ages shows. Proponents of the TDO also criticize the new AADO, saying the new all-ages events are now ignored by the police, and that the new law is confusing and ignored by unlicensed promoters. Raves have also been points of criticism; they have now been classified as \"concerts\" and are outside the scope of the ordinance while frequent use of MDMA by attendees have been reported.\n\nIn March 2006, in the aftermath of the Capitol Hill massacre where a gunman shot several partygoers after a rave, \"The Seattle Times\" editorialized against the new dance rules and called for the city's all-ages dance rules to be \"thoroughly re-examined and re-tooled.\" Local community leaders however have so-far ignored such pleas, noting that the incident was the work of a deranged gunman whose intent to kill could not be stopped with new city laws.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3506780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3506780", "title": "The Lorax", "text": "The Lorax\n\nThe Lorax is a children's book written by Dr. Seuss and first published in 1971. It chronicles the plight of the environment and the Lorax, who speaks for the trees against the Once-ler. As in most Dr. Seuss works, most of the creatures mentioned are original to the book.\n\nThe book is commonly recognized as a fable concerning the danger corporate greed poses to nature, using the literary element of personification to give life to industry as the Once-ler and the environment as the Lorax.\n\n\"The Lorax\" was Dr. Seuss's personal favorite of his books. He was able to create a story addressing economic and environmental issues without it being dull. \"\"The Lorax\",\" he once explained, \"came out of me being angry. In \"The Lorax\" I was out to attack what I think are evil things and let the chips fall where they might.\"\n\nA boy living in a polluted area visits a strange isolated man called the Once-ler on the Street of the Lifted Lorax. The boy pays the Once-ler fifteen cents, a nail, and the shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail to hear the legend of how the Lorax was lifted and taken away.\n\nThe Once-ler tells the boy of his arrival in a beautiful valley containing a forest of Truffula trees and a range of animals. The Once-ler, having long searched for such a tree as the Truffula, chops one down and uses its silk-like foliage to knit a Thneed, an impossibly versatile garment. The Lorax, who \"speaks for the trees\" as they have no tongues, emerges from the stump of the Truffula and voices his disapproval both of the sacrifice of the tree and of the Thneed itself. However, the first other person to happen by purchases the Thneed for $3.98, so the Once-ler is encouraged and starts a business making and selling Thneeds.\n\nThe Once-ler's small shop soon grows into a factory. The Once-ler's relatives all come to work for him and new vehicles and equipment are brought in to log the Truffula forest and ship out Thneeds. The Lorax appears again to report that the small bear-like Bar-ba-loots, who eat Truffula fruits, are short of food and must be sent away to find more. The Lorax later returns to complain that the factory has polluted the air and the water, forcing the Swanee-Swans and Humming-Fish to migrate as well. The Once-ler is unrepentant and defiantly tells the Lorax that he will keep on \"biggering\" his business, but at that moment one of his machines fells the very last Truffula tree.\n\nWithout raw materials, the factory shuts down and the Once-ler's relatives leave. The Lorax says nothing but with one sad backward glance lifts himself into the air \"by the seat of his pants\" and disappears behind the smoggy clouds. Where he last stood is a small monument engraved with a single word: \"UNLESS\". The Once-ler ponders the message for years, in solitude and self-imposed exile.\n\nIn the present, his buildings falling apart around him, the Once-ler at last realizes out loud what the Lorax meant: \"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not.\" He then gives the boy the last Truffula seed and urges him to grow a forest from it, saying that, if the trees can be protected from logging, then the Lorax and all of his friends may come back.\n\nBased on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association named \"The Lorax\" one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\". In 2012 it was ranked number 33 among the \"Top 100 Picture Books\" in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\" – the second of five Dr. Seuss books on the list.\n\nIn a retrospective critique written in the journal \"Nature\" in 2011 upon the 40th anniversary of the book's publication, Emma Marris described the Lorax character as a \"parody of a misanthropic ecologist\". She called the book \"gloomy\" and expressed skepticism that its message would resonate with small children in the manner intended. Nevertheless, she praised the book as effective in conveying the consequences of ecological destruction in a way that young children will understand.\n\nIn 1988, a small school district in California kept the book on a reading list for second graders, though some in the town claimed the book was unfair to the logging industry. \n\nTerri Birkett, a member of a family-owned hardwood flooring factory, authored \"The Truax\", offering a logging-friendly perspective to an anthropomorphic tree known as the \"Guardbark\". This book was published by the National Oak Flooring Manufacturers' Association (NOFMA). Just as in \"The Lorax\", the book consists of a disagreement between two people. The logging industry representative states that they have efficiency and re-seeding efforts. The Guardbark, a personification of the environmentalist movement much as the Once-ler is for big business, refuses to listen and lashes out. But in the end, he is convinced by the logger's arguments. However, this story was criticized for what were viewed as skewed arguments and clear self-interest, particularly a \"casual attitude toward endangered species\" that answered the Guardbark's concern for them. In addition, the book's approach as a more blatant argument, rather than one worked into a storyline, was also noted.\n\nThe line \"I hear things are just as bad up in Lake Erie\" was removed more than fourteen years after the story was published, after two research associates from the Ohio Sea Grant Program wrote to Seuss about the clean-up of Lake Erie. The line remains in the home video releases of the television special and in the audiobook read by Rik Mayall.\n\nThe book was adapted as an animated musical television special produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises, directed by Hawley Pratt and starring the voices of Eddie Albert and Bob Holt. It was first aired by CBS on February 14, 1972. A reference to pollution of Lake Erie was spoken by one of the Humming-Fish as they depart; it remains in DVD releases of the show, although later removed from the book. The special also shows the Once-ler arguing with himself, and asking the Lorax whether shutting down his factory (thus putting hundreds of people out of work) is practical. An abridged version of the special is used in the 1994 TV movie \"In Search of Dr. Seuss\", with Kathy Najimy's reporter character hearing the Once-ler's story.\n\nOn March 2, 2012, Universal Studios and Illumination Entertainment released a 3-D CGI film based upon the book. The release coincided with the 108th birthday of Seuss, who died at 87 in 1991. The cast includes Danny DeVito as the Lorax, Zac Efron as Ted (the boy in the book), and Ed Helms as the Once-ler. The film includes several new characters: Rob Riggle as villain Aloysius O'Hare, Betty White as Ted's Grammy Norma, Jenny Slate as Ted's neurotic mother Mrs. Wiggins, and Taylor Swift as Audrey, Ted's romantic interest. The film debuted in the No. 1 spot at the box office, making $70 million, though it received mixed reviews. The film eventually grossed a domestic total of $214,030,500.\n\nTwo audio readings have been released on CD, one narrated by Ted Danson in the United States (Listening Library, ) and one narrated by Rik Mayall in the United Kingdom (HarperCollins, ).\n\nA musical adaptation of \"The Lorax\" was originally included in script for the Broadway musical \"Seussical\", but was cut before the show opened.\n\nFrom December 2, 2015, to January 16, 2016, a musical version of the book ran at the Old Vic theatre in London. With former Noah and the Whale frontman, Charlie Fink, who wrote the music for the production.\n\n"}

Chungmu city and Tongyeong county were reunited in 1995, creating Tongyeong City as it is known today. It consists of Goseong Peninsula, Hansan Island, Mireuk Island and other islets. It was formerly known as Chungmu, after the posthumous name of Admiral Yi Sun-sin.

Unjudang established on Hansan Island in 1592, took charge of military education of the Joseon navy. It was later reconstructed with the changed name as \"Jeseungdang\" (제승당). Baegun Seojae was a \"seodang\", a private village school providing elementary education. Go Si-wan, a \"Silhak\" (practical learning) scholar founded it in 1805, the fifth year of King Sunjo's reign. Baegun Seojae is currently situated in the neighborhood of Docheon-dong and designated as the ninth Cultural Material of South Gyeongsang province. Tongyeong Hyanggyo was a state-sponsored provincial school (\"hyanggyo\") and was built in the site of the old Goseong Hyanggyo, which consists of 6 buildings; Daeseongjeon, Dongmu, Seomu, Myeongnyundang, Seojae, and Punghwaru. In the Daeseongjeon shrine, memorial tablets of five prominent scholars and Confucius are instituted.\n\nModern educational institutions started to be established in the city as Jinnam Commons School, the predecessor of Tongyeong Elementary School was opened in 1908. The educational system of Tongyeong is the same as elsewhere in the country. Schooling begins with preschools, of which there are 34 in the city. This is followed by 6 years in elementary schools, of which Tongyeong has 32 including 14 branch schools. Subsequently, students pass through 3 years of middle school. There are 11 middle schools in Tongyeong. High-school education, which lasts for three years, is not compulsory, but the most students do attend and graduate from high school. Tongyeong is home to 5 high schools. The College of Marine Science at Gyeongsang National University (GNU) is a branch campus in Tongyeong, specializing in marine-related studies. Its predecessor was Tongyeong Marine College, the successor of Gyeongnam Susan Jeonseupso (경남수산전습소) founded in 1917. The college was integrated into Gyeongsang National University in 1994.\n\nTongyeong is situated in the southern tip of Goseong peninsula and its three sides are surrounded by the sea. It consists of 41 inhabited and 110 uninhabited islands. Tongyeong Port, the east gate of Hallyeo Marine National Park, is referred to as the most beautiful port in South Korea.\n\nThe geography consists of low mountains crossing over the south to the north on the Goseong peninsula. The mountain range stretches out from Byeokbang mountain (650 m) on the boundary of northern Goseong county (Goseong-gun) to the south, encompassing Cheongae mountain (525 m), Baral mountain (261 m), Jeseokbong peak (279 m) and Yongha mountain (461 m) on Mireukdo island.\n\nAs Tongyeong is influenced by East Korea Warm Current, it has a mild oceanic climate during the whole year. The city is the warmest region in South Gyeongsang province, with the average annual temperature at . The coldest month is January, with an average temperature of 2.5 °C while the hottest month is August, with the average temperature of 25.7 °C. The average range of temperature is narrow. Plants growing in the city show characters of the warm temperate zone such as \"Cryptomeria\", \"Chamaecyparis obtusa\", \"Pinus thunbergii\", \"Paulownia coreana\", Pitch Pine, bamboo, camellia, and palm trees.\n\nThe average annual rainfall is 1,397 millimeters, so Tongyeong is classified as one of places in South Korea that have a lot of rain.\n\nTongyeong is twinned with:\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 2009, it was inscribed on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO, under the name \"Mongolian art of singing, Khoomei\".\n\nIn Mongolian throat singing, the performer produces a fundamental pitch and—simultaneously—one or more pitches over that. The history of Mongolian throat singing reaches far back. Many male herders can throat sing, but women are beginning to practice the technique as well. The popularity of throat singing among Mongolians seems to have arisen as a result of geographic location and culture. The open landscape of Mongolia allows for the sounds to carry a great distance. Ethnomusicologists studying throat singing in these areas mark \"khoomei\" as an integral part in the ancient pastoral animism that is still practiced today. Often, singers travel far into the countryside looking for the right river, or go up to the steppes of the mountainside to create the proper environment for throat-singing.\n\nThe animistic world view of this region identifies the spirituality of objects in nature, not just in their shape or location, but in their sound as well. Thus, human mimicry of nature's sounds is seen as the root of throat singing. An example of this is the Mongolian story of the waterfall above the Buyant Göl (Deer River in Tuvan), where mysterious harmonic sounds are said to have attracted deer to bask in the waters, and where it is said harmonic sounds were first revealed to people. Indeed, the cultures in this part of Asia have developed many instruments and techniques to mimic the sounds of animals, wind, and water. While the cultures of this region share throat singing, their styles vary in breadth of development.\n\nOrdinarily, melodies are created by isolating the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th partial in accordance with the harmonic series. Thus, if the fundamental frequency were C3, the overtones would be G5, B♭5, C6, D6, E6, G6. However, it is possible to reach as low as the 2nd and as high as the 24th. The fundamental pitch is typically around a G below middle C, and this affects the range of partials the singer can reach, with higher partials more easily reached on lower notes, and vice versa.\n\nThe people of Tuva have a wide range of throat singing vocalizations, and were the pioneers of six pitch harmonics. There are several different classification schemes for Tuvan throat singing. In one, the three basic styles are khoomei, kargyraa and sygyt, while the sub-styles include borbangnadyr, chylandyk, dumchuktaar, ezengileer and kanzyp. In another, there are five basic styles: khoomei, sygyt, kargyraa, borbangnadyr and ezengileer. The substyles include chylandyk, despeng borbang, opei khoomei, buga khoomei, kanzyp, khovu kargyraazy, kozhagar kargyraazy, dag kargyraazy, Oidupaa kargyraazy, uyangylaar, damyraktaar, kishteer, serlennedyr and byrlannadyr. These schemes all use Tuvan terminology.\n\nKhorekteer refers to the \"chest voice\". This is the voice that throat singers use when using khoomei, kargyraa, or any other harmonic-inducing style. The term can also be used to refer to all styles of Tuvan throat singing, much like khoomei. It can also refer to the feeling of chest resonance or pressure that one experiences when throat singing. Khorekteer is often used as a launching pad into the khoomei, sygyt, or kargyraa styles of throat singing.\n\nThe most popular style of Tuvan throat singing is known as Khoomei (or Khöömei, in Cyrillic: Хөөмей). Khoomei is traditionally a softer sounding style, with the fundamental (or drone) usually in the low-mid to midrange of the singer’s normal voice. In this style, usually 2 or 3 harmonics can be heard between one and two octaves above the fundamental. In Khoomei, the abdomen is fairly relaxed, and there is less tension on the larynx than in other styles. Pitch is manipulated through a combination of movements of the lips, throat, tongue or jaw.\n\nSinging in this style gives the impression of wind swirling among rocks.\n\nThe term \"Khoomei\" is also used as a generic term to designate all throat singing techniques in this region.\n\nSygyt (in Cyrillic: Сыгыт), literally 'whistling', has a midrange fundamental and is characterized by strong, flute-like or rather piercing harmonics, reminiscent of whistling. Also described as an imitation of the gentle breezes of summer, the songs of birds, the ideal sound for the harmonics is called Чистый звук—Russian for \"clear sound\".\n\nTo perform Sygyt, the tongue rises and seals around the gums, just behind the teeth. A small hole is left back behind the molars, either on the left or right side. The sound is then directed between the teeth to the front of the mouth. The lips form a bell-like shape, usually with an “ee\" vowel, and the sound is directed through this small opening. Pitch is manipulated exactly the same way as in khoomei style.\n\nArthur Miles was a 1920s Texan singer of cowboy songs. He is credited with independently creating a style of throat singing, similar to sygyt, as a supplement to the normal yodeling of Country Western music. Two recordings exist that are attributed to Arthur Miles. The recordings are the first and second parts of a tune titled \"Lonely Cowboy\".\n\nThe more deep sounding style of throat singing is known as Kargyraa (in Cyrillic: Каргыраа). Kargyraa has a deep, almost growling sound to it and is technically related to Tibetan Buddhist chant and has some similarities with vocal fry and the way Popeye's cartoon voice was created. It uses both the vocal and the vestibular folds (also known as \"false vocal chords\") simultaneously, creating two connected sources of sound.\n\nBy constricting the larynx, the vestibular folds can be brought together (adducted) and, under certain conditions, vibrate. It can produce an undertone exactly half the frequency of the fundamental produced by the vocal folds. Therefore, for each second vibration of the vocal folds, the vestibular fold completes a whole vibration cycle. While the larynx generates such rich sound, the mouth cavity may be shaped, just like in the manipulation of vowels, to select some particular harmonics, resulting in a sound that may be perceived as having different pitches simultaneously.\n\nThis vocal mechanism has been only recently elucidated and shown to be similar to the chant practiced in Tibet by the Gyuto monastery and other Buddhist orders. \nThere are two types of Kargyraa: \"Dag\" (mountain) and \"Xovu\" (steppe). The Dag style is deeper and has more nasal effects, while Xovu is raspier and sung at a higher pitch with more throat tension and less chest resonance. There are also the distinctive kargyraa styles of Vladimir Oidupaa and Albert Kuvezin, the latter also bearing the name \"kanzat\". This is sometimes described as the howling winds of winter or the plaintive cries of a mother camel after losing her calf.\n\nOf the following list, two effects that commonly employed in the khomeii, sygyt and kargyraa styles: Borbangnadyr and Ezengileer.\n\n\nThere were a few female throat singers in Tuva's history, though it was believed a woman performing throat singing could hurt her male relatives and cause her difficulties during childbirth. Choldak-Kara Oyun, the mother of the famous throat singer Soruktu Kyrgys and grandmother of the husband of famous Tuvan actress Kara-Kys Namzatovna Munzuk, throat sang throughout her life while milking her cows, singing lullabies to her children and sometimes while she was drinking Tuvan araga (fermented milk alcohol). Close relatives of famous singers, like Khunashtaar-ool's niece (in the 1960s) and Kombu's daughter (in the 1940s or 1950s), performed khoomei (throat singing) in public more than once. The wife of the throat singing shaman Bilek-ool from Manchurek, Aldinsova Tortoyavna, said that she has always sung khoomei \"because it was innate to [her] from birth.\" She could not resist singing khoomei after she got married and had children, and sang khoomei in public in the 1950s and 1960s. But her sister, who also sang khoomei as a girl, gave up when others repeatedly reminded her of the supposed dangers.\nIn the Soviet era it was rare for women to perform on stage, except during Republican festivals. Valentina Salchak performed throat singing in public in 1979. Valentina Chuldum from Mongun-Taiga (1960- Autumn 2002) toured European countries as a throat singer in the early 1990s. With the start of the International Symposium of Khoomei women could sing publicly there.\n\nTyva Kyzy (Тыва Кызы, pronounced ) (Daughters of Tuva, in Tuvan Turkish), founded in 1998, is an all-female folk ensemble performing Tuvan throat singing, under the direction of Choduraa Tumat. It is the first and only women's group in Tuva that performs all styles of Tuvan throat singing.\n\n\n</div>\n\n"}
