As an aspect of governance, it has been central to discussions related to problems in the public sector, nonprofit and private (corporate) and individual contexts. In leadership roles, accountability is the acknowledgment and assumption of responsibility for actions, products, decisions, and policies including the administration, governance, and implementation within the scope of the role or employment position and encompassing the obligation to report, explain and be answerable for resulting consequences.\n\nIn governance, accountability has expanded beyond the basic definition of \"being called to account for one's actions\". It is frequently described as an account-giving relationship between individuals, e.g. \"A is accountable to B when A is obliged to inform B about A's (past or future) actions and decisions, to justify them, and to suffer punishment in the case of eventual misconduct\". Accountability cannot exist without proper accounting practices; in other words, an absence of accounting means an absence of accountability.\n\nAccountability is an element of a RACI to indicate who is ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, and the one who delegates the work to those responsible.\n\nThere are various reasons (legitimate or excuses) why accountability fails.\n\n\"Accountability\" stems from late Latin \"accomptare\" (to account), a prefixed form of \"computare\" (to calculate), which in turn derived from \"putare\" (to reckon).\nWhile the word itself does not appear in English until its use in 13th century Norman England, the concept of account-giving has ancient roots in record keeping activities related to governance and money-lending systems that first developed in Ancient Egypt, Israel, Babylon, Greece, and later, Rome.\n\nBruce Stone, O.P. Dwivedi, and Joseph G. Jabbra list 8 types of accountability, namely: moral, administrative, political, managerial, market, legal/judicial, constituency relation, and professional. Leadership accountability cross cuts many of these distinctions.\n\nPolitical accountability is the accountability of the government, civil servants and politicians to the public and to legislative bodies such as a congress or a parliament.\n\nHirschman makes substantial contributions to accountability theory, positing exit or voice as pivotal accountability mechanisms. The relationship between the governor and governed (i.e., [autonomous (auto) - dependent (dep)], [auto-auto], [dep-dep], [dep-auto] ) functions such that the prospect of citizen exit can, not only disciplines ex ante, but also ex post if the state is dependent on the citizens. The literature connects this disposition of autonomy or dependence to its fiscal capacity. States that are most responsive adjust to exit or voice. Clark & Golder model the dynamics of Hirschman's theory and elaborate important aspects like those that operationalize loyalty as an active choice. Exit, voice, and loyalty will be expressed in different ways under differing regimes and given the relevant assumptions. All three of these sufficiently broad categories present ways and means of holding the state accountable.\n\nRecall elections can be used to revoke the office of an elected official. Generally, however, voters do not have any direct way of holding elected representatives to account during the term for which they have been elected. Additionally, some officials and legislators may be appointed rather than elected. Constitution, or statute, can empower a legislative body to hold their own members, the government, and government bodies to account. This can be through holding an internal or independent inquiry. Inquiries are usually held in response to an allegation of misconduct or corruption. The powers, procedures and sanctions vary from country to country. The legislature may have the power to impeach the individual, remove them, or suspend them from office for a period of time. The accused person might also decide to resign before trial. Impeachment in the United States has been used both for elected representatives and other civil offices, such as district court judges.\n\nIn parliamentary systems, the government relies on the support or parliament, which gives parliament power to hold the government to account. For example, some parliaments can pass a vote of no confidence in the government.\n\nBelsky et al. point out, whereas, under more democratic governance accountability is built into the institution of the state by a habit of regular elections, accountability in autocratic regimes relies on a selectorate; a group that legitimizes or delegitimizes the autocrats powers according to selectorate theory. The primary mechanism at a selectorate's disposal is deposition, which is a form of exit. Beyond that institutions can act as credible restraints on autocracy as well.\n\nResearchers at the Overseas Development Institute found that empowering citizens in developing countries to be able to hold their domestic governments to account was incredibly complex in practice. However, by developing explicit processes that generate change from individuals, groups or communities (Theories of Change), and by fusing political economy analysis and outcome mapping tools, the complex state-citizen dynamics can be better understood. As such, more effective ways to achieve outcomes can hence be generated.\n\nResearchers at the International Budget Partnership (IBP) found that civil society organizations play an important role in achieving accountability outcomes. The IBP case studies showed that CSOs can have an impact in a broad array of political and economic contexts. The researchers concluded that CSOs are most effective when they draw in a broad web of actors from across the accountability system, including the media, auditors, donors, the legislature, executive insiders, and political parties.\n\nWithin an organization, the principles and practices of ethical accountability aim to improve both the internal standard of individual and group conduct as well as external factors, such as sustainable economic and ecologic strategies. Also, ethical accountability plays a progressively important role in academic fields, such as laboratory experiments and field research. Debates around the practice of ethical accountability on the part of researchers in the social field – whether professional or others – have been thoroughly explored by Norma R.A. Romm in her work on Accountability in Social Research, including her book on New Racism: Revisiting Researcher Accountabilities, reviewed by Carole Truman in the journal Sociological Research Online. Here it is suggested that researcher accountability implies that researchers are cognizant of, and take some responsibility for, the potential impact of their ways of doing research – and of writing it up – on the social fields of which the research is part. That is, accountability is linked to considering carefully, and being open to challenge in relation to, one's choices concerning how research agendas are framed and the styles in which write-ups of research \"results\" are created.\n\nInternal rules and norms as well as some independent commission are mechanisms to hold civil servants within the administration of government accountable. Within department or ministry, firstly, behavior is bound by rules and regulations; secondly, civil servants are subordinates in a hierarchy and accountable to superiors. Nonetheless, there are independent \"watchdog\" units to scrutinize and hold departments accountable; legitimacy of these commissions is built upon their independence, as it avoids any conflicts of interests.\nThe accountability is defined as \"an element which is part of a unique responsibility and which represents an obligation of an actor to achieve the goal, or to perform the procedure of a task, and the justification that it is done to someone else, under threat of sanction\".\n\nThe traceability of actions performed on a system to a specific system entity (user, process, device). For example, the use of unique user identification and authentication supports accountability; the use of shared user IDs and passwords destroys accountability.\n\nBecause many different individuals in large organizations contribute in many ways to the decisions and policies, it is difficult even in principle to identify who should be accountable for the results. This is what is known, following Thompson, as the problem of many hands. It creates a dilemma for accountability. If individuals are held accountable or responsible, individuals who could not have prevented the results are either unfairly punished, or they \"take responsibility\" in a symbolic ritual without suffering any consequences. If only organizations are held accountable, then all individuals in the organization are equally blameworthy or all are excused. Various solutions have been proposed. One is to broaden the criteria for individual responsibility so that individuals are held accountable for not anticipating failures in the organization. Another solution, recently proposed by Thompson, is to hold individuals accountable for the design of the organization, both retrospectively and prospectively.\n\nWithin this perspective, a particular agency of the government is accountable if voices are heard from agencies, groups or institutions outside the public sector representing citizens' interests from a particular constituency or field. Moreover, the government is obliged to empower members of agencies with political rights to run for elections and be elected; or, appoint them into the public sector as a way to make the government representative and to ensure that voices from all constituencies are included in policy-making.\n\nWith the increase over the last several decades in public service provided by private entities, especially in Britain and the United States, some have called for increased political accountability mechanisms for otherwise non-political entities. Legal scholar Anne Davies, for instance, argues that the line between public institutions and private entities like corporations is becoming blurred in certain areas of public service in the United Kingdom, and that this can compromise political accountability in those areas. She and others argue that some administrative law reform is necessary to address this accountability gap.\n\nWith respect to the public/private overlap in the United States, public concern over the contracting of government services (including military) and the resulting accountability gap has been highlighted recently following the shooting incident involving the Blackwater security firm in Iraq.\n\nAccountability involves either the expectation or assumption of account-giving behavior. The study of account giving as a sociological act was articulated in a 1968 article on \"Accounts\" by Marvin Scott and Stanford Lyman, although it can be traced as well to J. L. Austin's 1956 essay \"A Plea for Excuses\", in which he used excuse-making as an example of speech acts.\n\nCommunications scholars have extended this work through the examination of strategic uses of excuses, justifications, rationalizations, apologies and other forms of account giving behavior by individuals and corporations, and Philip Tetlock and his colleagues have applied experimental design techniques to explore how individuals behave under various scenarios and situations that demand accountability.\n\nRecently, accountability has become an important topic in the discussion about the legitimacy of international institutions. Because there is no global democratically elected body to which organizations must account, global organizations from all sectors bodies are often criticized as having large accountability gaps. The Charter 99 for Global Democracy, spearheaded by the One World Trust, first proposed that cross-sector principles of accountability be researched and observed by institutions that affect people, independent of their legal status. One paradigmatic problem arising in the global context is that of institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund who are founded and supported by wealthy nations or individuals and provide grants and loans, to developing nations. Should those institutions be accountable to their founders and investors or to the persons and nations they lend money to? In the debate over global justice and its distributional consequences, Cosmopolitans tend to advocate greater accountability to the disregarded interests of traditionally marginalized populations and developing nations. On the other hand, those in the Nationalism and Society of States traditions deny the tenets of moral universalism and argue that beneficiaries of global development initiatives have no substantive entitlement to call international institutions to account. The One World Trust Global Accountability Report, published in a first full cycle 2006 to 2008, is one attempt to measure the capability of global organizations to be accountable to their stakeholders.\n\nStudent accountability is traditionally based on hang school and classroom rules, combined with sanctions for infringement. As defined by National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME), accountability is \"A program, often legislated, that attributes the responsibility for student learning to teachers, school administrators, and/or students. Test results typically are used to judge accountability, and often consequences are imposed for shortcomings.\"\n\nIn contrast, some educational establishments such as Sudbury schools believe that students are personally responsible for their acts, and that traditional schools do not permit students to choose their course of action fully; they do not permit students to embark on the course, once chosen; and they do not permit students to suffer the consequences of the course, once taken. Freedom of choice, freedom of action, freedom to bear the results of action are considered the three great freedoms that constitute personal responsibility. Sudbury schools claim that Ethics' is a course taught by life experience\". They adduce that the essential ingredient for acquiring values—and for moral action is personal responsibility, that schools will become involved in the teaching of morals when they become communities of people who fully respect each other's right to make choices, and that the only way the schools can become meaningful purveyors of ethical values is if they provide students and adults with real-life experiences that are bearers of moral import. Students are given complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a direct democracy in which students and staff are equals.\n\n Greater political accountability and lower corruption were more likely where newspaper consumption was higher in data from roughly 100 countries and from different states in the US. A \"poor fit between newspaper markets and political districts reduces press coverage of politics. ... Congressmen who are less covered by the local press work less for their constituencies: they are less likely to stand witness before congressional hearings ... . Federal spending is lower in areas where there is less press coverage of the local members of congress.\" This was supported by an analysis of the consequences of the closure of the \"Cincinnati Post\" in 2007. The following year, \"fewer candidates ran for municipal office in the Kentucky suburbs most reliant on the \"Post\", incumbents became more likely to win reelection, and voter turnout and campaign spending fell.\"\n\nAn analysis of the evolution of mass media in the US and Europe since World War II noted mixed results from the growth of the Internet: \"The digital revolution has been good for freedom of expression [and] information [but] has had mixed effects on freedom of the press\": It has disrupted traditional sources of funding, and new forms of Internet journalism have replaced only a tiny fraction of what's been lost. Various systems have been proposed for increasing the funds available for investigative journalism that allow individual citizens to direct small amounts of government funds to news outlets or investigative journalism projects of their choice.\n\nTo train people to conduct these kinds of investigations, Charles Lewis has proposed \"the creation of a new multidisciplinary academic field called Accountability Studies. ... [S]tudents from widely different academic backgrounds are excited about the prospect of learning exactly how to investigate those in power and hold them accountable.\"\n\nAccountability standards have been set up, and organizations can voluntarily commit to them. Standards apply in particular to the non-profit world and to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Accountability standards include:\nIn addition, some non-profit organizations set up their own commitments to accountability:\n\nViktor Frankl, neurologist, psychiatrist, author, and founder of logotherapy and one of the key figures in existential therapy, in his book \"Man's Search for Meaning\" recommended \"that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast (that has become a symbol of Liberty and Freedom) should be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast.\" Frankl stated: \"Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It was commissioned by , Cav. Mauriziano (1811-1878) as a monument for his family tomb in the (Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno), in Genova, Italy.\nAlong with the sculpture for the Oneto Family sculpted by Giulio Monteverde in 1882, the Carpaneto monument has become one of the most recognisable icons of Staglieno,\nappearing on an official cemetery brochure in 2014.\n\nGiovanni Scanzi was 38 years old when his patron Cav. Giacomo Carpaneto died and he began\nwork on the Carpaneto family tomb at Staglieno. Scanzi's early work was in the Realist style,\n\nand by this time he had also incorporated Symbolism\n(or, perhaps more accurately, \"l'iperdecorativismo eclettico\"),\nas seen in his sculptures of the\n\"Angelo della Resurrezione\" (Angel of Resurrection) on the (1877);\nthe later relief for the (1893); and other works at Staglieno.\n\nGiacomo Carpaneto, Cav. Mauriziano (1811-1878) was a respected merchant,\npart of a family originally from\nSampierdarena (S. Petri ad Arenaria) where the Palazzo Centurione-Carpaneto still\nstands.\nSignora Carpaneto also is interred in the family tomb.\n\nThe model for the \"Angelo Nocchiero\" sculpture was Antonio Dellapiane (1868-1942).\nAfter school, he worked as a shop-boy in a joiner's workshop in Sampierdarena, where Scanzi met him. Later, he started his own workshop, becoming a successful carpenter and wood carver.\nThe sculpture depicts an angel, standing astride a small boat, beginning to secure the sails at the end of a journey. His garments are streaming behind him, suggesting a strong wind. The prow of the boat is the stoic face of a woman, and under the prow the water swirls. Ropes are coiled in minute detail inside the boat (even though the average cemetery visitor would not be able to see them), and at the back of the boat is an embroidered cushion, slightly dented from a head resting there until a moment earlier.\n\nThe boat would be a familiar symbol to anyone in 19th century Genova, a seaport town,\nand the \"Angelo Nocchiero\" - \"Angel Helmsman\" - reminds the viewer of the spiritual\nboatmen of ancient mythology, whose job it was to transport the departed into the afterlife.\nThe clear imagery of the Guiding Angel is underscored by the epigraph in bronze lettering\non the pedestal: \"AVVENTURATO CHI NEL MARE DELLA VITA EBBE NOCCHIERO SÌ FIDO\" - \"Blessed\nis he who on the sea of life had so sure a guide\".\n\nMany famous people of the 19th century visited Staglieno, including Friedrich Nietzsche,\nGuy de Maupassant, and Mark Twain, who wrote about it in glowing terms in his \"Innocents Abroad\" (1868).\n\nThe visit in March 1893 of Empress Elisabeth of Austria, fondly known as 'Sissi', is legendary. Periodicals of the time reported that she arrived incognito as 'Lady Parker', and walked from the Principe to Staglieno, visiting a number of significant places along the way. When she came before Scanzi's \"Nocchiero\", she paused, apparently moved, and after a period of contemplation, had the epigraph copied into her personal notebook.\n\nMark Twain described the monuments at Staglieno as \"exquisitely wrought . . . full of grace and beauty. They are new, and snowy; every outline is perfect.\" After a century and a half Twain's description would not be quite the same, as the dust, mildew and pollution of an industrial city have settled on the marble surfaces, thieves have removed valuable bronze and other materials, and vandals have broken or otherwise defaced some of the monuments. \n\nThrough the work of local restoration experts and societies and individuals dedicated to\nthe preservation of \"the largest outdoor sculpture museum in Europe\", Scanzi's \"Angelo Nocchiero\" underwent a complete restoration in 2016.\nBeginning with a \"spolveratura\" - the removal of dust to allow a complete assessment of the\nrestoration work necessary - local experts worked for several months to remove the effects of time and abuse.\n\nMonumental Cemetery of Staglieno<br>\n\nAmerican Friends of Italian Monumental Sculpture (A.F.I.M.S.)(2017), https://staglieno.com/<br>\nM.P.

In classical ballet, an arabesque can be executed with the supporting leg \"en pointe\" or \"demi pointe\" or with foot flat on the floor.\n\nThe working leg may touch the floor in \"tendu\" back – an \"arabesque par terre\" – or be elevated. Common elevation angles of the raised leg are 45° – \"à demi hauteur\" – and 90° – \"à la hauteur\". When the angle is much greater than 90° and the body trunk leans forward to counterbalance the working leg, the position is called \"arabesque penchée\". The arms may be held in various positions.\n\nArabesques are described from the perspective of the dancer, in terms of the stage reference points used by the training system.\n\nGalina Kekisheva, a former soloist of the Kirov Ballet who studied with Agrippina Vaganova at the Leningrad School of Dance has described the changes in Russian ballet technique over time: \nNow it seems unimportant in the school if the dancer stands on his or her leg properly pulled up, or sits back into the hip socket. What is important to today's dancers is that the \"arabesque\" is higher than the head. There is no low \"arabesque\" that maintains a beautiful line, an \"arabesque\" from which, for example, you can do a turn. When you're sitting back on the [joint of the standing] leg, you can't go anywhere from there.\nKekisheva, who is now a coach with the Mariinsky ballet, has said that \"Vaganova's method is dissipating, and working in the classical repertoire has become more difficult\".\nIn the Vaganova method there are four basic \"arabesque\" positions. They are described here for a dancer facing point 8. In class practice, the arms are always level with the shoulders – \"arabesque de classe\", whereas in performance the arm in front may be raised above shoulder level – \"arabesque de scene\". The elbows are always facing downwards.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn \"arabesque tendue\" or \"dégagé\", and does not affect aplomb as the back remains straight. Most dancers do not have , therefore the working hip may open without lifting into the lower ribs, while the supporting hip lifts forward over the supporting foot, maintaining a .\nWhen the leg is moved or held above 45° or so, the dancer curves the spine both laterally and vertically. The method is to:\n\nNote that allowing for the dancer to open the hips is distinctly different than some older methods, that require the hips to remain down. Restraining the hips restricts range of motion, restricting the full curvature of the spine, (not allowing the spine to rotate laterally, thus increases compaction of vertebrae); nor for most dancers, to exhibit an outwardly rotated leg. Opening the hip allows dancers with lesser mobile bodies to safely achieve greater range of motion in arabesque.\n\nSuki Schorer has described the Balanchine arabesque as \"longer, stronger and bigger\". Balanchine would instruct students to \"reach for diamonds\" in both directions so the dancer's hands are not relaxed—the dancer's line should be elongated, but the arms should not be stiff.\n\nSchorer says the arabesque pliée \"is good to build strength in your legs to control the rate of descent to hold your body up when you land\". The dancer's bent knee is over the toe and the dancer should not penchée or tilt forward.\n\nIn the RAD system, there are three main arabesques. Here they are described for a dancer facing point 6:\n\n\n\n\nThe \"Shades scene\" from La Bayadère, choregraphed by Marius Petipa, is one of the masterpieces of classical style. It opens with a corps de ballet of 28 female dancers, dressed in white performing a simple arabesque as they make their entrance one by one.\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n"}

The antonym of this term, maleficence, describes a practice which opposes the welfare of any research participant.\n\nThe concept that medical professionals and researchers would always practice beneficence seems natural to most patients and research participants, but in fact, every health intervention or research intervention has potential to harm the recipient. There are many different precedents in medicine and research for conducting a cost–benefit analysis and judging whether a certain action would be a sufficient practice of beneficence, and the extent to which treatments are acceptable or unacceptable is under debate.\n\nDespite differences in opinion, there are many concepts on which there is wide agreement. One is that there should be community consensus when determining best practices for dealing with ethical problems.\n\nThese four concepts often arise in discussions about beneficence:\n\nOrdinary moral discourse and most philosophical systems state that a prohibition on doing harm to others as in #1 is more compelling than any duty to benefit others as in #2–4. This makes the concept of \"first do no harm\" different from the other aspects of beneficence. One example illustrating this concept is the trolley problem.\n\nMorality and ethical theory allows for judging relative costs, so in the case when a harm to be inflicted in violating #1 is negligible and the harm prevented or benefit gained in #2–4 is substantial, then it may be acceptable to cause one harm to gain another benefit. Academic literature discusses different variations of such scenarios. There is no objective evidence which dictates the best course of action when health professionals and researchers disagree about the best course of action for participants except that most people agree that the discussions about ethics should happen.\n\nSome outstanding problems in discussing beneficence occur repeatedly. Researchers often describe these problems in the following categories:\n\nMany people share the view that when it is trivial to do so, people should help each other. The situation becomes more complicated when one person can help another by making various degrees of personal sacrifice.\n\nResearchers should apply the concept of beneficence to individuals within the patient/physician relationship or the research-participant/researcher relationship. However, there is debate about the extent to which the interests of other parties, such as future patients and endangered persons, ought to be considered. When a researcher risks harm to a willing volunteer to do research with the intent to develop knowledge which will better humanity, this may be a practice of beneficence.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44730", "title": "Burgos", "text": "Burgos\n\nBurgos (, , ) is a city in northern Spain and the historic capital of Castile. It is situated on the confluence of the Arlanzón river tributaries, at the edge of the Iberian central plateau. It has about 180,000 inhabitants in the actual city and another 20,000 in the metropolitan area. It is the capital of the province of Burgos, in the autonomous community of Castile and León. Burgos was once the capital of the Crown of Castile, and the Burgos Laws or Leyes de Burgos which first governed the behaviour of Spaniards towards the natives of the Americas were promulgated here in 1512.\n\nIt has many historic landmarks, of particular importance; the Cathedral of Burgos (declared World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1984), seat of the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Burgos, the Las Huelgas Reales Monastery and Miraflores Charterhouse. A large number of churches, palaces and other buildings from the medieval age remain. The city is surrounded by the Fuentes Blancas and the Paseo de la Isla parks.\n\nCastilian nobleman, military leader and diplomat El Cid Campeador is a significant historical figure in the city, as he was born a couple of kilometres north of Burgos and was raised and educated here.\n\nThe city forms the principal crossroad of northern Spain along the Camino de Santiago, which runs parallel to the River Arlanzón.\n\nIt has a well-developed transportation system, forming the main communication node in northern Spain. In 2008, the international Burgos Airport started to offer commercial flights. Furthermore, AVE high speed trains are planned to start service in the near future, stopping at the newly-built Rosa de Lima train station.\n\nThe Museum of Human Evolution was opened in 2010, unique in its kind across the world and projected to become one of the top 10 most-visited museums in Spain. The museum features the first Europeans, which lived in this area 800,000 years ago.\n\nBurgos was selected as the \"Spanish Gastronomy Capital\" of 2013. In 2015 it was named \"City of Gastronomy\" by UNESCO and has been part of the Creative Cities Network since then.\n\nThere are several possible origins for the toponymy. When the city was founded, the inhabitants of the surrounding country moved into the fortified village, whose Visigothic name of Burgos signified consolidated walled villages (Gothic \"baurgs\"). The city began to be called \"Caput Castellae\" (\"Cabeza de Castilla\" or \"Head of Castile\").\n\nEarly humans occupied sites around Burgos as early as 800,000 years ago.\nWhen the Romans took possession of what is now the province of Burgos, the site had been a Celtic city. In Roman times, it belonged to Hispania Citerior (\"Hither Spain\") and then to Hispania Tarraconensis. In the 5th century, the Visigoths drove back the Suebi, then the Berbers occupied almost all of Castile in the 8th century, though only for a very brief period, and left little if any trace of their occupation. King Alfonso III the Great of León reconquered it about the middle of the 9th century, and built several castles for the defence of Christendom, which was then extended through the reconquest of lost territory. The region came to be known as Castile (Latin \"castella\"), i.e. \"land of castles\".\nBurgos was founded in 884 as an outpost of this expanding Christian frontier, when Diego Rodríguez \"Porcelos\", count of Castile, governed this territory with orders to promote the increase of the Christian population; with this end in view he gathered the inhabitants of the surrounding country into one fortified village. The city began to be called \"Caput Castellae\" (\"Cabeza de Castilla\" or \"Head of Castile\"). The county (\"condado\") of Castile, subject to the Kings of León, continued to be governed by counts and was gradually extended; one of these counts, Fernán González, established his independence.\nIn the 11th century, the city became the see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burgos and the capital of the Kingdom of Castile. Burgos was a major stop for pilgrims on the French Way the most popular path to Santiago de Compostela and a centre of trade between the Bay of Biscay and the south, which attracted an unusually large foreign merchant population, who became part of the city oligarchy and excluded other foreigners. Throughout the 13th and 14th centuries, Burgos was a favourite seat of the kings of León and Castile and a favoured burial site. The \"consejo\" or urban commune of Burgos was firmly in the hands of an oligarchic class of \"caballeros villanos\", the \"peasant knights\" of Burgos, who provided the monarchs with a mounted contingent: in 1255 and 1266 royal charters granted relief from taxes to those citizens of Burgos who owned horses and could arm themselves, provided that they continue to live within the city walls. The merchant oligarchy succeeded the cathedral chapter as the major purchasers of land after 1250; they carried on their mercantile business in common with municipal or royal functions and sent their sons to England and Flanders to gain experience in overseas trade. A few families within the \"hermandades\" or confraternities like the Sarracín and Bonifaz succeeded in monopolising the post of \"alcalde\", or mayor; a special court, the \"alcalde del rey\" was first mentioned at Burgos in 1281. By the reign of Alfonso X, the exemption of the non-noble knights and religious corporations, combined with exorbitant gifts and grants to monasteries and private individuals, placed great stress on the economic well-being of the realm.\n\nIn the century following the conquest of Seville (1248) on the Moors, Burgos became a testing ground for royal policies of increasing power against the \"consejo\", in part by encouraging the right to appeal from the \"consejo\" to the king. In 1285, Sancho IV added a new body to the \"consejo\" which came to dominate it: the \"jurado\" in charge of collecting taxes and overseeing public works; the king reserved the right to select its members. The city perceived that danger to its autonomy came rather from an uncontrolled aristocracy during royal minorities: Burgos joined the \"hermandades\" of cities that leagued together for mutual protection in 1295 and 1315. In the 14th century, official royal intrusion in city affairs was perceived as a palliative against outbreaks of violence by the large excluded class of smaller merchants and artisans, on whom the tax burden fell. The \"alguacil\" was the royal official instituted to judge disagreements.\n\nOn 9 June 1345, sweeping aside the city government, Alfonso XI established direct royal rule of Burgos through the \"Regimiento\" of sixteen appointed men.\n\nIn 1574, Pope Gregory XIII made the bishopric a Metropolitan archbishopric, at the request of king Felipe II.\n\nBurgos has been the scene of many wars: with the Moors, the struggles between León and Navarre, and between Castile and Aragon. In the Peninsular War against Napoleonic France, the siege of Burgos (between 19 September to 21 October) was a scene of a withdrawal for Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Again in the 19th-century Carlist civil wars of the Spanish succession Burgos was the scene of a battle. During the Spanish Civil War, Burgos was the base of General Franco's rebel Nationalist government.\nAt an elevation of , the city of Burgos lies in the transition zone between a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen \"Csb\") and an Oceanic climate (Köppen \"Cfb\"), with some continental influence resulting from its distance from the sea and higher altitude. Burgos' climate features chilly and windy winters, due to altitude and an inland location, which always include snow and temperatures below freezing. Temperature ranges can be extreme and Burgos is drier than Spain's coastal regions, although there is year-round precipitation. Average annual precipitation is and the average annual relative humidity is 72%. In winter, temperatures very often (almost every day) drop below freezing, often reaching temperatures as low as , and snowfalls are common, while the summer months see average high temperatures of . The lowest recorded temperature in Burgos was on 20 January 1885. The highest recorded temperature was on 13 August 1987.\n\nBurgos is rich in ancient churches and convents. The three most notable are the cathedral, with its chapel of the Condestables de Castilla (Lords Constable of Castile), the monastery of Las Huelgas and the Carthusian monastery of Miraflores. Minor notable churches are San Esteban, San Gil (Sancti Aegidii), San Pedro, San Cosme y San Damián, Santiago (Sancti Jacobi), San Lorenzo and San Lesmes (Adelelmi). The Convento de la Merced, occupied by the Jesuits, and the Hospital del Rey are also of historic and architectural interest.\n\nAmong the other interesting architectural structures, in the walls of the city are the famous gateway of Santa María, erected for the first entrance of the Emperor Charles V, and the arch of Fernán González.\n\nConstruction on Burgos' Gothic Cathedral began in 1221 and spanned mainly from the 13th to 15th centuries. It has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The west front is flanked by towers terminating in octagonal spires covered with open stonework traceries. The middle section, which serves as an entrance, has three alabaster pilasters, the intercolumnar spaces bearing panel-pictures representing the martyrdom of saints. The façade possessed ornate and fantastic surface decoration.\n\nThe octagonal chapel of the Condestable, in florid, thus highly sculpted, Gothic design, has a roof finished with balustraded turrets, needle-pointed pinnacles and statues. In the lower portion, coats of arms, shields and crouching lions have been worked into the ensemble. The exterior of the sacristy is decorated with carved traceries, figures of angels and armoured knights. The elaborate tabernacle is composed of two octagonal sections in Corinthian style.\n\nThe \"Monasterio de las Huelgas Reales\" (Monastery of the Royal Retreats) on the outskirts of the city, was founded in 1180 by king Alfonso VIII, and was begun in a pre-Gothic style, although almost every style has been introduced over many additions. The remarkable cloisters have been described as \"unrivalled for beauty both of detail and design, and perhaps unsurpassed by anything in its age and style in any part of Europe\" (1911 Encyclopædia Britannica). One cloister has semicircular arches with delicate and varied columns; the other has an ogival style of early Gothic. The interior of the church has enormous columns supporting its magnificent vault; the entrance is modern. This convent historically benefited from extraordinary privileges granted to its abbess by kings and popes.\n\nThe Carthusian monastery, Miraflores Charterhouse (\"Cartuja de Miraflores\") is situated about four kilometres from the historic city center. Among the treasures of the Charterhouse are the wooden statue of St. Bruno, the wooden choir stalls in the church and the tombs of King Juan II and of his spouse, Queen Isabella of Portugal, constructed of marble and with their recumbent effigies sculpted in alabaster. Around the top frieze are statues of angels in miniature. The French soldiers in the Spanish War of Independence (1814) mutilated this beautiful work, cutting off some of the heads and carrying them away to France. King Juan II's daughters by his first wife, heiresses Princessses Catherine and Eleanor of Asturias, are also buried in the monastery.\n\nThe city preserves its medieval historic centre, corresponding to the city walls.\n\nBurgos has a total of 10 museums, the newest being the Museum of Human Evolution (the 10th most visited museum in Spain).\n\nThe Museum of Human Evolution was inaugurated on 13 July 2010. Its foundation is based on the archeological site of Atapuerca located east of Burgos. The Atapuerca site has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It contains several caves, where fossils and stone tools of the earliest known hominids in West Europe have been found, near Atapuerca Mountains.\n\nThe museum also allows the visitor to travel to the archaeological site and biological park.\n\nIt summarizes the history of the province of Burgos. It has important objects and documents from all the ages, starting from Atapuerca, passing to the Romans and Iberians, and finishing in the contemporary period.\n\nThe museum is located in the renaissances palaces, the House of Íñigo Angulo and the House of Miranda, which has a main patio that structures the museum.\n\nBetween the Main Square \"Plaza Mayor\" and the Promenade of the Espolón \"Paseo del Espolón,\" on the side street, Travesía del Mercado nº3, you find the Fadrique de Basilea Book Museum \"Museo del Libro Fadrique de Basilea\", of the Burgos publisher, Siloé, a cosy museum that shows the history of the book from its first written form to its modern electronic form.\n\nState Education in Spain is free, and compulsory from 6 to 16 years. The current education system is called LOE (\"Ley Orgánica de Educación\").\n\n\nOften abbreviated 'UBU', the University of Burgos is a public university with about 10,000 students studying over 30 different undergraduate degrees, over 20 PhD Programmes, as well as several Official Masters and other graduate courses. It was established in 1994 when it was divided from the University of Valladolid.\n\nUBU cooperates with the Erasmus Project, a European Union (EU) student-exchange programme, and each semester hosts students from various countries across the 15-state European Union, as well as Iceland, Lichtenstein, Norway, Malta and associated countries in Eastern Europe. Additionally, university students from various regions around the world including China, Latin and North America are able to participate in exchange programmes to study abroad at the University of Burgos. In total, the University of Burgos has education agreements with over 100 international academic institutions.\nInternational University Isabel I of Castile\n\nBased in Burgos, it is a new-developed private online university which became operational during 2013. It offers distance and some classroom education. This University has been promoted by Education Campus of Castile and Leon.\n\nThe photos below are taken from a very popular view point that requires quite a hike up stairs to El Castillo (the castle). There visitors can see all of Burgos. During special events throughout the year, visitors can see a firework display from that same view point.\n\nMost of the parks in the city of Burgos can be found along the river Arlanzón. Indeed, the banks of the river itself constitute a green corridor along the city. In total, there are nearly 3 square miles (1,878 acres) of parks in Burgos and one tree for every 3 inhabitants.\n\n\n\nBurgos is a rich city, with a GDP above the Spain average. It is an important trade and tourist center with some manufacturing.\n\nWheat is a major crop. The city is surrounded by wheat fields.\n\nBurgos is a very industrial city, with a secondary sector widely developed. The city has the biggest industrial park of north Spain, called \"Villalonquéjar\".\n\nThe city is the headquarters of Grupo Antolin, designer and manufacturer of interior automotive components.\n\nIt is also the headquarters for south Europe Benteler International.\n\nIt employs the bigger percentage in the city and is represented by the public sector (production, delivery and allocation of goods and services), due to the capital status.\n\nThe city has a complete culture infrastructure, remarked by the Auditorio y Palacio de Congresos de Burgos, which opened in mid-2012.\n\nSpanish, also called Castilian, originated in Castile and spread throughout the Crown of Castile's possessions following the reconquista. It was eventually dispersed throughout the Spanish empire following the conquest and colonization of the Americas, and Spain after the union of the Catholic Monarchs's kingdoms being co-spoken with other languages. Of the many different variations and dialects found throughout the world, it's argued that the purest Spanish can be found in the region of Burgos due to the fact that the language first developed here in the 10th-century.\n\nThe Spanish language can be traced back to the monastery of Valpuesta located north-east of the city of Burgos. The Valpuesta cartularies are significant in the history of the Spanish language, and their status as manuscripts containing the earliest words written in Spanish has been officially recognised.\nThe first utterings of Spanish continued in the \"Silos Glosses\", recorded in the Burgos monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos.\n\nBurgos province is famous in gastronomy for:\n\nQueso de Burgos, a white cheese which is soft and unctuous (because it is made with whey). Although originally made with sheep's milk, now cow's milk or mixtures are more common. Each \"comarca\" (rural district) produces a minor variation, and the major dairies produce an industrial product that is acceptable for people with sensitive digestion.\n\nBurgos is blessed with a moderate climate and this fresh cheese was able to be conserved there without the need for curing of more than 10 days. With the improvement of aseptic industrial production processes this can be extended to about 30 days at a cool 6 °C. Its production reaches 35,000 tons annually.\n\nMorcilla de Burgos, a pig's-blood sausage (black pudding), is a staple country food famous across the Iberian peninsula. Spiced with onions and herbs its most noticeable content is rice (often mistaken for fat) which makes it one of the lightest and healthiest products of its kind. Oral tradition says that it must be \"salty, smooth and piquant\" (see Spanish pages for details). As with the Queso de Burgos, several comarcas or towns in the province (Cardeñadijo, Sotopalacios, Aranda de Duero, Briviesca, Covarrubias, Villarcayo, Trespaderne, Miranda de Ebro...) made their own morcillas, with minor variations between them.\n\nEven though Burgos is not on a D.O. wine is a fundamental piece in local gastronomy thanks to nearby wine cellars from Ribera de Duero, Rioja and Arlanza D.O.\n\nBurgos Airport is located only from the city centre, with daily flights to Barcelona International Airport, and during spring and summer to Palma de Mallorca and Paris Orly.\n\nThe city is considered a first-class rail route through which one rail lines circulate, operated by Renfe: Madrid-Irun. The faster trains use the AVE line between Madrid and Valladolid.\n\n2010 marked 150 years since the arrival of the first railway to the city; the first train was present on 25 October 1860. Madrid was joined with the French border and this was considered the main route of railway communication between Spain and Europe. Located at the halfway point, Burgos soon become an important hub of communications between the centre and the north.\n\nSince December 2007, the city has been connected to the main provincial capitals by high-speed service Alvia. It also provides other services, middle and long distance, which connect with the main population centres of the country. 18 long distance trains and 12 middle distance trains circulate through the station each day, which results in around 330,000 yearly users.\n\nThe new railway station was opened on 12 December 2008 under the name Burgos-Rosa de Lima, belonging to ADIF. It is located in the neighbourhood of Villímar, northeast of the city, and has been adapted for the future arrival of the AVE. Bus 25 will take you direct to the city centre.\n\nIn 2017, AVE high speed trains will serve the city, connecting it to cities such as Madrid in only 84 minutes, or Bilbao in 70 minutes.\n\nA project to implement a tram for the city has been planned, which would run the length of the Boulevard, officially called the Avenida de Valencia. It would consist of a line of about long and will originate from the Burgos-Rosa de Lima railway station and end at the University of Burgos. Its cost is estimated between 80 and 120 million euros.\n\nDue to the economic crisis and real estate, the project has been postponed temporarily until further funding becomes available. In February 2010 work began on the development of the Boulevard, which reserves a lane for public transport: first buses, and eventually the tram.\n\nBurgos has an international bus station located in the city centre, just one hundred meters from the Cathedral. It connects the city with nearly every region of Spain, as well as with a wide number of European (Amsterdam, Basel, Bern, Bratislava, Brussels, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, Geneva, Gdańsk, Kiev, Lisbon, Ljubljana, Lviv, Łódź, London, Lyon, Marseille, Moscow, Munich, Nice, Paris, Porto, Prague, Rotterdam, Sofia, The Hague, Warsaw, Zürich) and even North African (Casablanca, Marrakech, Rabat) cities.\n\nThe city has its own public bicycle rental system, called \"Bicibur\". It has been designed by a local company and has more than 20 points of distribution throughout the city. A network of over of bicycle lanes net the city making it the 6th largest bicycle lane network in Spain and the first in kilometres per resident.\n\nBurgos has undertaken many efforts concerning sustainable mobility, and it won the CiViTAs City of the Year in 2007, the most important Award at the European level and the Energy Globe Award in 2008 (the sustainability Nobel awards) in the Air Category for the same reason. The city is the leader among Spanish cities in terms of sustainable mobility with big efforts for a city centre free of cars, a free bicycle loan system and 100% clean public transport. Burgos now leads the CiViNET Network of cities concerned with sustainable mobility in Spain and Portugal.\n\nBurgos is twinned with:\n\n\nThe mayors of Bruges in Belgium's Flemish Region and Burgos signed a treaty on 29 January 2007 in Bruges's city hall for future cooperation. This engagement could be seen as a prologue on the opening of the exhibition Comeliness and Madness. This exhibition on king Philip the Handsome -who also ruled the Burgundian countries- took place in the Casa del Cordón in Burgos where the monarch died. On 30 January 2007, the exhibition opened in Bruges, the city where Philip the Handsome was born and where the urn with his heart is kept in Onthaalkerk O.L.V. (the Church of Our Lady).\n\nBurgos and San Juan de los Lagos sponsor and coordinate activities between both populations.\n\nSegundo de Chomón filmed a short documentary about this city in 1911.\n\nBurgos is the setting for one of the scenes in the 2010 film \"The Way\" by Emilio Estevez starring his father Martin Sheen.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5802282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5802282", "title": "Casebook method", "text": "Casebook method\n\nThe casebook method, similar to but not exactly the same as the case method, is the primary method of teaching law in law schools in the United States. It was pioneered at Harvard Law School by Christopher C. Langdell. It is based on the principle that rather than studying highly abstract summaries of legal rules (the technique used in most countries), the best way to learn American law is to read the actual judicial opinions which become the law under the rule of \"stare decisis\" (due to its Anglo-American common law origin).\n\nTo set up the case method of law study, American law professors traditionally collect the most illustrative cases concerning a particular area of the law in special textbooks called casebooks. Some professors heavily edit cases down to the most important paragraphs, while deleting nearly all citations and paraphrasing everything else; a few present all cases in full, and most others are in between. One common technique is to provide almost all of the entire text of a landmark case which created an important legal rule, followed by brief notes summarizing the holdings of other cases which further refined the rule. \nTraditionally, the casebook method is coupled with the Socratic method in American law schools. For a given class, a professor will assign several cases from the casebook to read, and may also require students to be familiar with any notes following those cases. In class, the professor will ask students questions about the assigned cases to determine whether they identified and understood the correct rule from the case, if there is one—in certain heavily contested areas of the law, there will \"not\" be any \"one\" correct rule.\n\nA typical example in the law of contracts is \"Hadley v Baxendale\" (1854), a case that is still routinely tested on bar examinations today. Treatises designed for practicing lawyers as well as textbooks for students earning non-legal degrees (i.e., business law courses for business administration students) concisely state the famous rules announced in that case that (1) consequential damages are limited to those foreseen by the parties at the time of contracting, thus implying that (2) a party must notify the other up front of its specific needs in order to expand what is mutually foreseeable and thereby recover consequential damages if the other breaches. Thus stated, \"Hadley\" seems simple enough, but a casebook for a law school course will \"never\" say that. Rather, the law student must deduce those principles from the somewhat archaic text of the Court of Exchequer's mid-19th-century decision.\n\nThis teaching method differs in two ways from the teaching methods used in most other academic programs: (1) it requires students to work almost exclusively with primary source material, which can be written in obscure or obsolete language for older cases; and (2) a typical American law school class is supposed to be a dialogue about the meaning of a case, not a straightforward lecture.\n\nIn some law schools, the casebook method is used in conjunction with lectures or other more structured forms of instruction. This is especially true in classes which are more heavily geared toward statutory law, such as tax law (which in the USA is governed by the Internal Revenue Code) and certain areas of commercial law (particularly courses dealing with the Uniform Commercial Code).\n\nThis method is also used in other common law countries, including Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nTo facilitate the case method of study, \"law school outlines\" are used as legal topic study aids. Typically, the outlines are created by law school students; however, there are professional outlines also available. An outline typically provides a concise and direct statement of legal issues in a particular area of law, organized according to the typical law school curriculum. In some cases, outlines are organized according to specific professors or courses. Outlines often remove many legal nuances and fact specific distinctions in case law to establish more generalized legal principles. Students must remember to be cautious before relying on outlines written by others found on online databases. They frequently come with copyright notices and may often be outdated. Many such sites also warn their users that relying on these outlines alone will not be sufficient to prepare for an exam and they should only be used as a supplement to the studying process.\n\n"}
{"id": "5881", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5881", "title": "Century", "text": "Century\n\nA century (from the Latin \"centum\", meaning \"one hundred\"; abbreviated c.) is a period of 100 years. Centuries are numbered ordinally in English and many other languages.\n\nA centenary is a hundredth anniversary, or a celebration of this, typically the remembrance of an event which took place a hundred years earlier.\n\nAlthough a century can mean any arbitrary period of 100 years, there are two viewpoints on the nature of standard centuries. One is based on strict construction, while the other is based on popular perspective (general usage). \n\nAccording to the strict construction of the Gregorian calendar, the 1st century AD began with 1 AD and ended with 100 AD, with the same pattern continuing onward. In this model, the \"n\"-th century started/will start on the year \"(100 × n) − 99\" and ends in \"100 × n\". Because of this, a century will only include one year, the centennial year, that starts with the century's number (e.g. 1900 was the last year of the 19th century).\n\nIn general usage, centuries are aligned with decades by grouping years based on their shared digits. In this model, the 'n' -th century started/will start on the year \"(100 x n) - 100\" and ends in \"(100 x n) - 1\". For example, the 20th century is generally regarded as from 1900 to 1999, inclusive. This is sometimes known as the odometer effect. The astronomical year numbering and ISO 8601 systems both contain a year zero, so the first century begins with the year zero, rather than the year one. \n\nInformally, years may be referred to in groups based on the hundreds part of the year. In this system, the years 1900–1999 are referred to as the \"nineteen hundreds\" (\"1900s\"). Aside from English usage, this system is used in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Finnish. The Swedish \"nittonhundratalet\" (or \"1900-talet\"), Danish \"nittenhundredetallet\" (or \"1900-tallet\"), Norwegian \"nittenhundretallet\" (or \" 1900-tallet\") and Finnish \"tuhatyhdeksänsataaluku\" (or \"1900-luku\") refer unambiguously to the years 1900–1999.\n\nWhile the century has been commonly used in the West, other cultures and calendars have utilized differently sized groups of years in a similar manner. The Hindu calendar, in particular, summarizes its years into groups of 60, while the Aztec calendar considers groups of 52.\n\n\n"}

Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge, in the sense of what they think subconsciously, changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them. \n\nCognitive anthropology has strong ties to ethnoscience and linguistics.\n\nCognitive anthropology studies a range of domains including folk taxonomies, the interaction of language and thought, and cultural models. \n\nFrom a linguistics stand-point, cognitive anthropology uses language as the doorway to study cognition. Its general goal is to break language down to find commonalities in different cultures and the ways people perceive the world. Linguistic study of cognitive anthropology may be broken down into three subfields: semantics, syntactics, and pragmatics.\n\nIn contrast to traditional ethnographic methods in cultural anthropology, cognitive anthropology primarily uses quantitative methodologies in order to study culture. Because of the field's interest in determining shared knowledge, consensus analysis has been used as its most widely used statistical measure. \n\nOne of the techniques used is Cultural Network Analysis, the drawing of networks of interrelated ideas that are widely shared among members of a population. Recently there has been some interchange between cognitive anthropologists and those working in artificial intelligence.\n\nAnthropology is one of six fields which contributed to the founding of cognitive science. However, anthropology has been criticised for being detached from cognitive science.\n\n\n\n"}

The property is of land, with the rest being occupied by the Government Service Insurance System, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and the Privatization and Management Office. It is part of Bay City (formerly Boulevard 2000) that spans of reclaimed land along Manila Bay which is occupied by the SM Central Business Park, Philippine National Bank's Financial Center Area, and PAGCOR's Entertainment City, among others. \n\nThe complex is bounded by the Manila Bay to the north and west, the Philippine Navy headquarters to the northeast, Roxas Boulevard to the east, and Jose Diokno Boulevard to the south. It is divided into two zones: the Art Zone, and the Commercial and Entertainment Zone. It features several brutalist structures designed in the 1960s and 1970s by Leandro Locsin, such as the Tanghalang Pambansa, the Philippine International Convention Center, and the Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila. Other locators in the complex include the Coconut Palace, the Manila Film Center and Star City amusement park.\n\nThe Tanghalang Pambansa () is the flagship venue and principal offices of the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Formally called the Theater of Performing Arts, it houses three major performing arts venues, one theater for film screenings, galleries, a museum and the center's library and archives. \n\n\nDesigned by National Artist for Architecture Leandro Locsin, its design was based and expanded upon the unconstructed Philippine-American Friendship Center. The \"Tangahalan\" is a primary example of the architect's signature style known as the floating volume, a trait can be seen in structures indigenous to the Philippines such as the nipa hut. Being a work of a National Artist, the brutalist structure is qualified to be an important cultural landmark as stipulated in Republic Act No. 10066.\n\nThe Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas, more commonly known by its original name of Folk Arts Theater, is a covered proscenium amphitheater is where popular concerts are usually staged. It has a seating capacity of 8,458 in ten sections. The building was originally built to seat an audience of 10,000 and was commissioned by then First Lady Imelda Marcos in 1974 for the Miss Universe Pageant, which was to be held in Manila. The theater was built in record time of seventy-seven days in time for the pageant and was designed by Leandro V. Locsin.\n\nIt was host to many popular musical acts of the 1980s onwards, including Puerto Rican group Menudo, British pop group 5ive, Janet Jackson, Gary Valenciano and Jay R. The Folk Arts Theater is also used as a site by different religious groups. Day by Day Christian Ministries, a large international religious organization, has leased the area since 2005. They have dedicated the Theatre as \"Bulwagan ng Panginoón\" (). The building is expected to be torn down in the future, subject to the development of the Complex.\n\nThe CCP Complex is also home to the following:\n\nThe Cultural Center of the Philippines was conceived in 1966 when Ferdinand Marcos issued Executive Order No. 60, establishing its board and arranging for his wife Imelda to become chair of its Board of Directors.\n\nThe Philippine-American Culture Foundation provided a Ninety Thousand Peso Grant for its construction and additional funds were taken from the Cultural Development Fund and the Special Fund for Education. It soon became the premier symbol of what would be called Imelda's edifice complex.\n\nA comprehensive master plan for the development of the complex was unveiled in 2003. The plan would divide the CCP Complex into six clusters, each of which will be anchored by a major building. First, the Promenade, which will tentatively be named after Lucresia Reyes-Urtula, will include retail and other mixed-use facilities, as well as dock facilities. The second cluster will be the Arts Sanctuary, which will serve as the complex's cultural core. To be anchored by the Tanghalang Pambansa, it will contain a new performing arts theater, the artists' center, a bandstand, the CCP's Production Design Center, as well as other open areas.\n\nThe third cluster, the Green Zone will contain a mix of museums, parks with commercial and office spaces. Fourth, the Creative Hub cluster, containing spaces for creative industries. Fifth, The Arts Living Room, envisioned to be a high-density, high-rise area that will house condominiums and similar residential projects. The final cluster, the Breezeway, will be located by low-rise, low-density commercial structures with seafront entertainment facilities. Covered walkways, plazas, and bicycle lanes are planned to connect the various buildings and clusters to ensure a pedestrian-centered design. The master plan is envisioned to be completed in four phases, from 2004 to 2014; ₱5 billion will be needed for the plan's first five years, and another ₱8 billion for the plan's latter half. A design contest was held in 2005 to design the first two clusters. Three firms won for their concepts; Syndicated Architects, Manalang-Tayag-Ilano Architects, and JPA Buensalido Design. The concepts of each winner will then be presented to prospective investors and stakeholders for approval.\n\nIn 2011, Leandro V. Locsin Partners, Architects won the design contest for the Artists' Center and Performing Arts Theater, the two buildings that will anchor the Promenade and Arts Sanctuary Clusters respectively. The proposed Artists' Center will house offices and rehearsal spaces for the CCP's resident companies, a black box theater and rooms for educational programs. The winning design is akin to a traditional Badjao village or a mangrove forest, with rooms and pavilions supported by slim pilotis. The proposed Performing Arts Theater will contain a 1,000 seat conventional proscenium theater and a black box that will seat 300-500 people. In contrast with the \"Tanghalang Pambansa's\" massive travertine block, the façade of the new theater will be dominated by its main seating bowl clad in reflective material, evoking a wave rising out of the sea. On January 19, 2016, construction of a new black box theater started with the aim of eventually integrating the new structure into the proposed Performing Arts Theater. Estimated to cost ₱50 million, the new theater will be three to four times bigger than the Tanghalang Huseng Batute, the current black box facility of the CCP.\n"}

{"id": "321214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=321214", "title": "End Poverty in California movement", "text": "End Poverty in California movement\n\nThe End Poverty in California movement (EPIC) was a political campaign started in 1934 by socialist writer Upton Sinclair (best known as author of \"The Jungle\"). The movement formed the basis for Sinclair’s campaign for Governor of California in 1934. The plan called for a massive public works program, sweeping tax reform, and guaranteed pensions. It gained major popular support, with thousands joining End Poverty Leagues across the state. EPIC never came to fruition due to Sinclair’s defeat in the 1934 election, but is seen as an influence on New Deal programs enacted by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n\nSinclair laid out his vision for EPIC in his 1933 book \"I, Governor of California, and How I ended Poverty: A True Story of the Future\". Specifically, the plan called for state seizure of idle factories and farm land where the owner had failed to pay property taxes.The government would then hire the unemployed to work on the farms and at the factories. The farms would then operate as self-sufficient, worker-run co-ops. EPIC also called for the implementation of California’s first state income tax.The tax was to be progressive, with the wealthiest being taxed at 30%. The plan would also have increased inheritance taxes and instituted a 4% tax on stock transfers. EPIC also included government provided pensions for the old, disabled, and widowed. To implement EPIC, Sinclair called for the creation of three new government agencies: the California Authority for Land (CAL), the California Authority for Production (CAP), and the California Authority for Money (CAM). CAL was to implement the plan for seizure and cultivation of unused farm lands. CAP was to do the same for idle factories. CAM meanwhile was to be used to finance CAL and CAP by issuing scrip to workers and issues bonds for the purchase of lands, factories, and machinery.\n\nAfter two previous unsuccessful runs for Governor as a member of the Socialist Party, Sinclair was encouraged by the election of President Roosevelt in 1932 to switch his affiliation to the Democratic Party in September 1933. A grassroots movement soon formed in support of EPIC, with thousands joining End Poverty Leagues across the state. A weekly newspaper, the \"EPIC News\", appeared in support of the plan, and reached a circulation of nearly a million by the time of the gubernatorial primary election in August 1934. Several EPIC-supporting candidates won their primaries for California State Assembly and Senate seats. Sinclair did not receive full support from the party establishment, however, and Roosevelt refused to endorse him, seeing the EPIC plan as too radical.\n\nThe Socialist party in California and nationwide refused to allow its members to be active in any other party including the Democratic Party and expelled him, along with socialists who supported his California campaign. The expulsions destroyed the Socialist party in California.\n\nEPIC faced major opposition by the Republican Party and major media figures. Opponents of EPIC “organized the most lavish and creative dirty-tricks campaign ever seen—one that was to become a landmark in American politics” involving “turning over a major campaign to outside advertising, publicity, media and fundraising consultants for the first time.” Notable among these opponents were the heads of the major movie studios in Hollywood. This was largely due to Sinclair’s proposal to hand over idle movie studio lots to unemployed film workers to make movies of their own. In reaction, the studio heads threatened to move film operations to Florida, and deducted money from employee’s paychecks to give directly to the campaign of Sinclair’s Republican opponent for governor, Frank Merriam. In addition, two of the state’s most influential media moguls, William Randolph Hearst and Harry Chandler used their papers to solely cover Merriam’s campaign and to attack Sinclair. \n\nIn the face of this coordinated opposition, and without the backing of Roosevelt, Sinclair began trailing Merriam in the polls. On November 6, 1934, Merriam defeated Sinclair with 1,138,629 (48.9%) to Sinclair’s 879,537 (37.8%). Despite his defeat, Sinclair’s vote total was the twice as large as the vote total of any Democratic candidate in California history to that point. In addition, two dozen candidates running on the EPIC platform were elected to the state legislature, including Culbert Olson, who became Governor four years later.\n\nThe EPIC movement continued after Sinclair's defeat. It \"recalled a mayor, kicked out a district attorney, replaced the governor with one of our choice\" between 1934 and 1938, according to Robert A. Heinlein, who by then was deputy publisher of the \"EPIC News\". Heinlein also ran for State Assembly in Hollywood and Beverly Hills in 1938. He lost, causing him to take up science fiction writing to pay off his campaign debt.\n\nDespite Sinclair’s defeat, EPIC is recognized as having been very influential in shaping Roosevelt’s New Deal programs. In late 1934, Harry Hopkins, a senior adviser to Roosevelt who went on to oversee many New Deal programs, proposed an \"End Poverty in America\" campaign that \"The New York Times\" wrote “differs from Sinclair’s plan in detail, but not in principle.”\n\nYears later, California State Supreme Court Justice Stanley Mosk declared that EPIC was “the acorn from which evolved the tree of whatever liberalism we have in California.”\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22737375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22737375", "title": "Febold Feboldson", "text": "Febold Feboldson\n\nFebold Feboldson is an American folk hero who was a Swedish American plainsman and cloudbuster from Nebraska. His exploits were originally published in 1923 in the \"Gothenburg Independent\" newspaper and the character is now largely considered a part of fakelore as opposed to a genuine folk hero.\n\nThe first stories of Febold Feboldson were published in newspapers in Gothenburg, Nebraska, in 1923. The original creator of Febold Feboldson appears to be Wayne Caroll, a lumber salesman in Gothenburg who used Febold in advertising, essentially as a local variant of Paul Bunyan. However, due to the lack of trees in the Great Plains region, Feboldson eventually became a strongman rather than a lumberjack, and his prodigious strength was demonstrated through other means in the stories. Caroll and another man, Don Holmes, wrote numerous Febold Feboldson stories between 1928 and 1933, which featured Feboldson taking on Native Americans, politicians, disease outbreaks, droughts, tornadoes, and even excessive heat and cold.\n\nIn 1932, Paul Robert Beath published the first widely-circulated story about Febold Feboldson, \"Paul Bunyan and Febold\" in the University of Nebraska - Lincoln's literary magazine, \"Prairie Schooner\" (vol. VI, p. 59-61). Beath's account claims to be based on interviews with Bergstrom Stromberg, an elderly descendant of Feboldson, who was well-acquainted with both Bunyan and Feboldson. The association with Bunyan gave Febold Feboldson authenticity as a folk hero, despite being a recent creation by Nebraska authors. Beath went on to write about Feboldson in the \"Nebraska Folklore\" pamphlets published by the Nebraska Writers' Project in 1937.\n\nBeath firmly denied the idea that Febold Feboldson was a folk hero. Instead, according to Beath, Feboldson was, like all stories, created \"by individuals for the entertainment of individuals.\" Beath argued that each telling of a Febold Feboldson story was based entirely on the narrative which the individual author wished to tell, rather than being formed from existing folklore or a \"geist\" of the culture from which they are born.\n\nAccording to folklorist Louise Pound, Feboldson is an integral part of , due to his rapid rise in popularity in the early twentieth century. However, Pound argues that Febold is part of the \"lore of the literary class, the lore of the educated lovers of lore\" rather than the general public. This, according to Pound, takes the \"folk\" element out of Feboldson's status as a figure in folklore, as he is not widely-known by the average Nebraskan who does not seek out folklore. Pound further argues that Feboldson could have a trajectory similar to the folklore figure which inspired him, Paul Bunyan, which began as a similarly \"literary lore\" but has since evolved into folklore.\n\nBeath's original story, \"Paul Bunyan and Febold,\" is as much a story about Paul Bunyan as it is about Febold Feboldson. In the story, which attempts to account for the death of Babe the Blue Ox, Feboldson and Bunyan are both portrayed as giants who helped settle the American West. According to the tale, Feboldson and Bunyan met when they were both tasked with reestablishing the Kansas-Nebraska border after Bunyan had turned the allegedly formerly mountainous land of Kansas upside down to reveal its current, flat plains. Bunyan hitched a plough to Babe, but could not plough a straight line, and instead of carving out the border, carved the channel of the Republican River. In response, Feboldson hybridized bees with eagles to create gigantic bees. Feboldson hitched his plough to the giant bee, which flew off in a perfectly straight \"bee-line.\"\n\nDue to their success, the two giants were sent to fight off the \"Dirtylegs tribe\" of Native Americans, who were the worst foes on the plains. However, because of the excessive heat of the year, which never fell below 150 degrees, both the giants and the tribe agreed on a truce until cooler weather. As part of their truce, both parties retired to Colorado, to cool off in the shade of the mountains. The Dirtylegs, still too hot, dug caves into the mountains, which accounts for the existence of cave dwellings today.\n\nOn the journey to the mountains, Babe the Blue Ox became exhausted and fell asleep in the shade of Pikes Peak. Knowing that the ox would die of hyperthermia when the sun rose the next morning and unable to move the gigantic ox, Febold and Paul pile up rocks around the creature to shade it from the sun. Unfortunately, the rocks only served to help cook the ox whole. Around Christmas, the Dirtylegs left their cave dwellings and, starving from their months of fasting, devoured the ox. They left the rocks which had been piled up around him strewn about the area, which created the Garden of the Gods. However, the meat of Babe was too much for the stomachs of the Dirtylegs and the entire tribe died after consuming him, which is why no one has ever heard of the Dirtylegs since.\n\nThis story is, as is to be expected, entirely fabricated. There is no evidence that any tribe known as the \"Dirtylegs\" ever existed, nor do they appear to be modeled on a particular tribe. The portrayal of Native Americans as villains, enemies of progress, or obstacles of settlement is consistent with other American folklore and is rooted in ideas of Manifest Destiny and the history of the colonization of the American West.\n\n"}

{"id": "33548162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33548162", "title": "Hypernasal speech", "text": "Hypernasal speech\n\nHypernasal speech (also hyperrhinolalia or open nasality; medically known as Rhinolalia aperta from greek \"rhinolalia\": \"nasal speech\" and \"aperta\": \"open\") is a disorder that causes abnormal resonance in a human's voice due to increased airflow through the nose during speech. It is caused by an open nasal cavity resulting from an incomplete closure of the soft palate and/or velopharyngeal sphincter. In normal speech, nasality is referred to as nasalization and is a linguistic category that can apply to vowels or consonants in a specific language. The primary underlying physical variable determining the degree of nasality in normal speech is the opening and closing of a velopharyngeal passageway between the oral vocal tract and the nasal vocal tract. In the normal vocal tract anatomy, this opening is controlled by lowering and raising the velum or soft palate, to open or close, respectively, the velopharyngeal passageway.\n\nThe palate comprises two parts, the hard palate (palatum durum) and the soft palate (palatum molle), which is connected to the uvula. The movements of the soft palate and the uvula are made possible by the velopharyngeal sphincter. During speech or swallowing, the soft palate lifts against the back throat wall to close the nasal cavity. When producing nasal consonants (such as \"m\", \"n\", and \"ng\"), the soft palate remains relaxed, thereby enabling the air to go through the nose.\n\nThe Eustachian tube, which opens near the velopharyngeal sphincter, connects the middle ear and nasal pharynx. Normally, the tube ensures aeration and drainage (of secretions) of the middle ear. Narrow and closed at rest, it opens during swallowing and yawning, controlled by the tensor veli palatini and the levator veli palatini (muscles of the soft palate). Children with a cleft palate have difficulties controlling these muscles and thus are unable to open the Eustachian tube. Secretions accumulate in the middle ear when the tube remains dysfunctional over a long period of time, which cause hearing loss and middle ear infections. Ultimately, hearing loss can lead to impaired speech and language development.\n\nThe general term for disorders of the velopharyngeal valve is velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD). It includes three subterms: velopharyngeal insufficiency, velopharyngeal inadequacy, and velopharyngeal mislearning.\n\nThere are several methods for diagnosing hypernasality.\n\nHypernasality is generally segmented into so-called 'resonance' effects in vowels and some voiced or sonorant consonants and the effects of excess nasal airflow during those consonants requiring a buildup of oral air pressure, such as stop consonants (as /p/) or sibilants (as /s/). The latter nasal airflow problem is termed 'nasal emission', and acts to prevent the buildup of air pressure and thus prevent the normal production of the consonant. In testing for resonance effects without the aid of technology, speech pathologists are asked to rate the speech by listening to a recorded sentence or paragraph, though there is much variability in such subjective ratings, for at least two reasons. First, the acoustic effect of a given velopharyngeal opening varies greatly depending on the degree of occlusion of the nasal passageways. (This is the reason why a stuffy nose from an allergy or cold will sound more nasal than when the nose is clear.) Secondly, for many persons with hypernasal speech, especially hearing impaired, there are also mispronunciations of the articulation of the vowels. It is extremely difficult to separate the acoustic effects of hypernasality from the acoustic effects of mispronounced vowels (examples). Of course, in speech training of the hearing impaired, there is little possibility of making nasality judgments aurally, and holding a finger to the side of the nose, to feel voice frequency vibration, is sometimes recommended.\n\nIn cases of muscle weakness or cleft palate, special exercises can help to strengthen the soft palate muscles with the ultimate aim of decreasing airflow through the nose and thereby increasing intelligibility. Intelligibility requires the ability to close the nasal cavity, as all English sounds, except \"m\", \"n\", and \"ng\", have airflow only through the mouth. Normally, by age three, a child can raise the muscles of the soft palate to close to nasal cavity.\n\nWithout the use of a technological aid, nasal emission is sometimes judged by listening for any turbulence that may be produced by the nasal airflow, as when there is a small velopharyngeal opening and there is some degree of mucous in the opening. More directly, methods recommended include looking for the fogging of a mirror held near the nares or listening through a tube, the other end of which is held in or near a nares opening.\n\nThere have been many attempts to use technological augmentation more than a mirror or tube to aid the speech pathologist or provide meaningful feedback to the person attempting to correct their hypernasality. Among the more successful of these attempts, the incompleteness of velopharyngeal closure during vowels and sonorants that causes nasal resonance can be estimated and displayed for evaluation or biofeedback in speech training through the nasalance of the voice, with nasalance defined as a ratio of acoustic energy at the nostrils to that at the mouth, with some form of acoustic separation present between the mouth and nose. In the nasalance measurement system sold by WEVOSYS, the acoustic separation is provided by a mask-tube system, nasalance measurement system sold by Kay-Pentax, the acoustic separation is provided by a solid flat partition held against the upper lip, while in the system sold by Glottal Enterprises the acoustic separation can be by either a solid flat partition or a two-chamber mask.\n\nHowever, devices for measuring nasalance do not measure nasal emission during pressure consonants. Because of this, a means for measuring the degree of velopharyngeal closure in consonants is also needed. A commercially available device for making such measurements is the Perci-Sar system from Microtronics. The Nasality Visualization System from Glottal Enterprises allows both the measurement of Nasal Emission and Nasalance. In the presence of a cleft palate, either of these systems can be helpful in evaluating the need for an appliance or surgical intervention to close the cleft or the success of an appliance or a surgical attempt to close the cleft.\n\nIf a child finds it difficult to blow, pinching the nose can help regulate airflow. The child should then practice speech sounds without pinching the nose.\nThese exercises only work as treatments if hypernasality is small. Severe deviations should be treated surgically.\n\nThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of traditional non-speech oral motor exercises can reduce hypernasality. Velopharyngeal closure patterns and their underlying neuromotor control may differ for speech and nonspeech activities. Therefore, the increase in velar movement through blowing, sucking, and swallowing may not transfer to speech tasks. Thus, hypernasality remains while individual speak. Kuehn proposed a new way of treatment by using a CPAP machine during speech tasks. The positive pressure provided by a CPAP machine provides resistance to stregthen velopharyngeal muscles. With nasal mask in place, an individual is asked to produce VNCV syllables and short sentences. It is believed that CPAP therapy can increase both muscle endurance as well as strength because it overloads the levator veli palatini muscle and involves a regimen with a large number of repetitions of velar elevation. Research findings proved that patients with hypernasality due to flaccid dysarthria, TBI or cleft palate do eliminate hypernasality after receiving this training program.\n\nThe two main surgical techniques for correcting the aberrations the soft palate present in hypernasality are the posterior pharyngeal flap and the sphincter pharyngoplasty. After surgical interventions, speech therapy is necessary to learn how to control the newly constructed flaps.\n\nPosterior pharyngeal flap surgery is mostly used for vertical clefts of the soft palate. The surgeon cuts through the upper layers of the back of the throat, creating a small square of tissue. This flap remains attached on one side (usually at the top). The other side is attached to (parts of) the soft palate. This ensures that the nasal cavity is partially separated from the oral cavity. When the child speaks, the remaining openings close from the side due to the narrowing of the throat caused by the muscle movements necessary for speech. In a relaxed state, the openings allow breathing through the nose.\n\nSphincter pharyngoplasty is mostly used for horizontal clefts of the soft palate. Two small flaps are made on the left and right side of the entrance to the nasal cavity, attached to the back of the throat. For good results, the patient must have good palatal motion, as the occlusion of the nasal cavity is mainly carried out by muscles already existing and functioning.\nThe most common complications of the posterior pharyngeal wall flap are hyponasality, nasal obstruction, snoring, and sleep apnea. Rarer complications include flap separation, sinusitis, postoperative bleeding, and aspiration pneumonia. Possible complications of the sphincter pharyngoplasty are snoring, nasal obstruction, difficulty blowing the nose.\n\nSome researches suggest that sphincter pharyngoplasty introduces less hyponasality and obstructive sleep symptoms than the posterior pharyngeal wall flap. Both surgeries have a favourable effect on the function of the Eustachian tube.\n"}

He has been a leading literary figure in Albania since the 1960s. He focused on poetry until the publication of his first novel, \"The General of the Dead Army\", which made him famous outside of Albania. In 1996, he became a lifetime member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques of France.\n\nIn 1992, he was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca; in 1998, the Herder Prize; in 2005, he won the inaugural Man Booker International Prize; in 2009, the Prince of Asturias Award of Arts; in 2015, the Jerusalem Prize, and in 2016, he was a \"Commandeur de la Légion d'Honneur\" recipient. \n\nKadare is regarded by some as one of the greatest European writers and intellectuals of the 20th century and, in addition, as a universal voice against totalitarianism. \n\nIsmail Kadare was born on 28 January 1936 in Gjirokastër in Albania, to Halit Kadare, a post office employee, and Hatixhe Dobi, a homemaker.\nHe attended primary and secondary schools in Gjirokastër and studied Languages and Literature at the Faculty of History and Philology of the University of Tirana. In 1956 Kadare received a teacher's diploma. He later studied at the Maxim Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow from 1958 to 1960. \n\nWhile studying literature in Moscow he managed to get a collection of his poems published in Russian, and there he also wrote his first novel \"The City with no Signs\" in 1959, intentionally defying the rules of socialist realism.\n\nAfter returning home in 1960 because of the Soviet-Albanian split, he worked as a journalist and then embarked on a literary career. He tried to publish a fragment of his first novel camouflaged as a short story titled \"Coffeehouse Days\". Upon being published in the literary magazine \"Zëri i Rinisë\" in 1962, it was immediately banned by the authorities. He was advised by his close friends not to tell anybody about the actual novel, so it stayed in his drawers for decades until the communist regime fell in 1990.\n\nIn 1963, he published his first novel titled \"The General of the Dead Army\" whose French translation by the persecuted Isuf Vrioni, published by Albin Michel in 1970 led to Kadare's international breakthrough. The novel was not received well by the critics in Albania at the time.His next novel, \"The Monster\", published in the magazine \"Nëntori\" in 1965, was banned immediately. After offending the authorities with a political poem in 1975, he was forbidden to publish for three years\n\nIn March 1982 \"The Palace of Dreams\" was harshly condemned in a Writer's Plenum. The writer was accused of making allusions to Communist Albania in it, citing several ambiguous passages. As a result, the work was banned. Kadare was also accused by the president of the League of Albanian Writers and Artists of deliberately evading politics by cloaking much of his fiction in history and folklore. Around the time of Hoxha's death in 1985, his novel \"A Moonlit Night\" was banned by the authorities. The same year he wrote \"Agamemnon's Daughter\"— a direct critique of the oppressive regime in Albania, which was smuggled out of the country with the help of Kadare's French editor Claude Durand.\n\nIn 1990, Kadare claimed political asylum in France, issuing statements in favor of democratization. At that time, he stated that \"dictatorship and authentic literature are incompatible. The writer is the natural enemy of dictatorship\". During the 1990s and 2000s he was offered multiple times to become President of Albania, but declined. He has divided his time between Albania and France since 1990.\n\nCritical opinion is divided as to whether Kadare should be considered to have been a dissident or a conformist during the Communist period. For his part, Kadare has stated that he had never claimed to be an \"Albanian Solzhenitsyn\" or a dissident, and that \"dissidence was a position no one could occupy [in Enver Hoxha's Albania], even for a few days, without facing the firing squad. On the other hand, my books themselves constitute a very obvious form of resistance\". Henri Amouroux, a member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques of France, pointed out that Soviet dissidents including Solzhenitsyn had published their works during the era of de-Stalinization, whereas Kadare lived and published his works in a country which remained Stalinist until 1990.\nRobert Elsie, an expert of Albanian Literature also stressed the fact that, the conditions in which Kadare lived and published his works were not comparable to other European communist countries where at least some level of public dissent was tolerated, rather, the situation in Albania was comparable to North Korea or the Soviet Union in the 1930s under Stalin. Despite all of this, Kadare used any opportunity to attack the regime in his works, by means of political allegories, which were picked up by educated Albanian readers.\n\nHe is married to an Albanian author, Helena Kadare (née Gushi), and has two daughters. His daughter Besiana is the Albanian ambassador to the United Nations. \n\nIn English, his works have been translated by David Bellos.\n\nIn 1996 Kadare became a lifetime member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of France, where he replaced the philosopher Karl Popper. In 1992, he was awarded the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca, and in 2005 he received the inaugural Man Booker International Prize. In 2009, Kadare was awarded the Prince of Asturias Award for Literature. In the same year he was awarded an Honorary Degree of Science in Social and Institutional Communication by the University of Palermo in Sicily. In 2015, he was awarded the bi-annual Jerusalem Prize.\n\nThe London newspaper \"The Independent\" said of Kadare: \"He has been compared to Gogol, Kafka and Orwell. But Kadare's is an original voice, universal yet deeply rooted in his own soil\".\n\nThe central theme of his works is totalitarianism and its mechanisms. Kadare's novels draw on legends surrounding the historical experiences of Albanian people, the representation of classical myths in modern contexts, and the totalitarian regime in Albania. They are obliquely ironic as a result of trying to withstand political scrutiny. Among his best-known books are \"The General of the Dead Army\" (1963), \"The Siege\" (1970), \"The Ghost Rider\" (1980), \"Broken April\" (1980), \"The Palace of Dreams\" (1981), \"The Pyramid\",\"The Successor\" (2003).\n\n\"The Pyramid\" (1992) was set in Egypt in the 26th century BC and after. In it, Kadare mocked Hoxha's fondness for elaborate statues, the pyramid form also reflecting any dictator's love for hierarchy and useless monuments. In some of Kadare's novels, comprising the so-called \"Ottoman Cycle\", the Ottoman Empire is used as the archetype of a totalitarian state. \"The Fall of the Stone City\" (2008) was awarded the Rexhai Surroi Prize in Kosovo, and was shortlisted for Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in 2013.\n\nKadare has been mentioned as a possible recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature several times. His works have been published in about 45 languages.\n\nThe following Kadare novels have been translated into English:\n\n\nThe complete works (except for the essays) of Ismail Kadare were published by Fayard, simultaneously in French and Albanian, between 1993 and 2004. Omitted from the list are the poetry and the short stories. Kadare's original Albanian language works have been published exclusively by Onufri Publishing House since 1996, as single works or entire sets. Being published in 2009 the complete works in 20 volumes.\n\nThe dates of publication given here are those of the first publication in Albanian, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n"}

(1997), M.A. (2003) and a PH.D. in 2007, with all degrees in history. He is currently Associate Professor of Chinese Studies at Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea. He had previously taught at Brown University, Columbia University and Peking University. He is the associate director of the Asia Society Center on U.S.-Chinese relations. He is the co-author, with Orville Schell, of \"Wealth and Power: China's Long March to the Twenty-first Century\" (Random House, 2013).He is a frequent contributor to multiple journals and newspapers, including Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, Global Asia, 38 North. and The New York Times.\n\nHis career as a historian took a self-described detour when he visited South Korea for the first time in 2006 to meet his wife's family. His area of interest had been limited to modern Chinese history. After further visits to Korea, he joined the Yonsei faculty in 2010 and made Seoul his home base. His academic interests have since broadenend to include Korean peninsula studies, North and South; he has visited North Korea four times. He feels that his new interest in Korean affairs has broadened his views on China as well as U.S.-China relations.\n\nDelury states that knowledge of China's history is critical; without looking backward to grasp the forces at work for hundreds of years, it is not possible to know China today or its possible future trends. He posits that through China's recent history there is one constant: \"the search for something, anything,\" that will restore China's greatness (fuqiang 富強, signifying “wealth and power”). China's challenge now is to reconcile its current success to its past sufferings, and relieve their historical sense of inferiority. Delury looks for historical parallels, such as the 1895 Gongche Shangshu movement, the 1919 May Fourth Movement, the Tiananmen Square protest of 1989, and the 2014 Umbrella Movement, threads which can be strung together, to chart alternate trajectories for the competing visions of China's future political and social order; he opines there are no right or wrong tides of history to take comfort in. \n\nWhile Mao had contempt for ancient Chinese customs, in the 1980's the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) began to use traditional themes and prominent classical vocabulary. A prominent example is \"harmonious society\" (Chinese: 和谐社会; pinyin: \"héxié shèhuì\"), used as a socioeconomic vision in China and to deflect the problems of social inequality. Delury traces the history and usage of the Chinese word \"harmonious\" and is critical of the CCP, calling this usage \"the pseudo-Confucianism of the CCP.\" He notes that Xi's political program of austerity is a reflection of a traditional political precept, dating from Confucius.\n\nTraveling in North Korea evoked for Delury the sensation of time travel; Kim's charismatic dictatorship and the socialist ethos of Mao on the one side, with the grassroots marketization and consumer revolution of Deng's China on the other. As with the history of China, it is important to know the North Korean history, and he is critical of American officials who know little about this subject. Without this knowledge it is unlikely for American officials to understand and realistically deal with North Korea's nuclear weapons program, a highly complex problem with a lot of variation over time.It takes years to understand that history and you can't read in a book even if you had time, you have to meet the people.Delury has several significant disagreements with President Trump's North Korea policy. President Trump has relied on China's influence on North Korea to exert pressure on the regime to give up its nuclear weapons, using trade with China as an inducement. Delury notes that since 1958 China has not had any meaningful impact on North Korea's foreign policy. Delury has described the sanctions as futile and counterproductive. He has argued that they are unenforceable and unlikely to stop North Korea's nuclear weapons program. He has a more conciliatory approach, suggesting that the best chance for them to give up its nuclear weapons is by helping North Korean economic development. He recommends a gradual elimination of the sanctions. Talk of a preventive war had become part of the mainstream debate before the recent thaw in U.S.-North Korea relations; Delury feels that this should not be an option. Delury has been described as the media's \"go-to expert\" on North Korea; he warns that news about North Korea tends to be sensationalized, and care should be taken in judging its veracity.There's a global appetite for any North Korea story and the more salacious the better. Some of it is probably true – but a great deal of it is probably not...the normal standards of journalism are thrown out of the window because the attitude is: 'it's North Korea – no one knows what's going on in there.'\n\n"}
{"id": "42978493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42978493", "title": "John Whitmer Historical Association", "text": "John Whitmer Historical Association\n\nThe John Whitmer Historical Association (JWHA) is an independent, nonprofit organization promoting study, research, and publishing about the history and culture of the Latter Day Saint movement. It is especially focused on the Community of Christ (formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or RLDS Church), other midwestern Restoration traditions, and early Mormonism. The Community of Christ's approach to its own history was influenced, in part, by historical problems raised and explored through JWHA publications and conferences, and those of its sister organization, the Mormon History Association. JWHA membership numbers around 400 and is open to all, fostering cooperation with LDS and non-Mormon scholars.\n\nBefore the founding of the JWHA, scholarship in the field of Mormon history had been developing. In the 1950s, scholars like Fawn Brodie, Juanita Brooks, Thomas O'Dea, and Leonard Arrington began applying academic methods to their religious history, giving rise to the New Mormon History. In this spirit, Robert Flanders, a professor at the RLDS-affiliated Graceland College, published \"Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi\" in 1965. The book presented controversies, like Joseph Smith's polygamy, that were in contrast to faith-promoting teachings of the RLDS Church, and brought a backlash from some RLDS members. Then Richard P. Howard, another proponent of the New Mormon History, was appointed Church Historian in 1966, further upsetting some traditional believers. Howard opened the church archives and was optimistic about historical challenges.\n\nThis progressive approach to Mormon studies inspired \"Courage: A Journal of History, Thought and Action\", founded in 1970 by several faculty from Graceland College. Contrasting with conservative RLDS publishing, \"Courage\" ventured a fresh look at RLDS issues and historical problems, often diverging from traditional interpretations. The independent journal closed in 1973, by which time several of its team had started the JWHA.\n\nThroughout this time, Mormon historical scholarship was developing within The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Utah. In 1965 the Mormon History Association was founded, which included RLDS historians amongst its officers. The periodicals \"BYU Studies\" (started 1959) and \"Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought\" (started 1966) published articles from MHA members. MHA founder Leonard Arrington was appointed LDS Church Historian in 1972, forming a new Church Historical Department which was active in the historical community.\n\nDespite positive experiences, RLDS historians in the midwest found MHA participation difficult due to the distance to Utah. So on September 18, 1972, fifteen like-minded RLDS historians met together in Independence, Missouri, in the living room of Richard P. Howard, the official historian of the RLDS Church, and organized the John Whitmer Historical Association. Some had organizational expertise from their service as MHA officers.\n\nMost of these were already members of the MHA, and the JWHA was founded with the intent to continue the collaboration and warm relations with the MHA. Richard Howard won an MHA award in 1970 and was interested in exchanging ideas between LDS and RLDS scholars. From its beginning the JWHA board of directors included LDS members, and Utah historians were invited to join. The first JWHA meeting was held in September 1973 in Nauvoo, Illinois.\n\nFounded as an independent group, not under the direction of any church, the JWHA would be free to explore historical controversies. Participants supported the New Mormon History, cultivating a lively tradition of exploring controversy in Mormonism. Some traditionalists and religious leaders warned that this approach could damage faith, while questioning and liberal Latter Day Saints found community and intellectual freedom. As John Whitmer, the first Church Historian in 1831, was remembered for his controversial history of early Mormonism and falling out with church leaders, the name evoked taking the side of the historian when in conflict with the institution.\n\nThrough the JWHA, RLDS members confronted Joseph Smith's historical link with Mormon polygamy, a defining issue for the RLDS Church. Church leaders worried that publications in the 1960s and 1970s, including Flanders's book, might trouble church members after more than a century of official RLDS insistence that Smith was never involved. On direction from President Wallace B. Smith, Howard undertook a five-year study which was then edited and softened by RLDS leaders and historians in 1982. The First Presidency recommended it be presented at the JWHA, and later in the \"John Whitmer Historical Association Journal\". But after some blowback the First Presidency denied involvement, saying the \"JWHA Journal\" did not speak for the church. Jan Shipps commented that \"faith seemed endangered and help and comfort were needed\".\n\nThis became one of the \"Church-shaking changes\" that transformed the RLDS Church in the 1980s and 1990s, alongside the ordination of women, the new temple in Independence, and the break with father-son succession of the presidency. The church moved from its Mormon heritage toward liberal Protestantism, adopting the name Community of Christ in 2001.\n\nW. Grant McMurray, church president from 1996-2004, demonstrates the influence of the JWHA on the Community of Christ. Working for the church as a researcher and later as the archivist, McMurray advanced into church leadership. During this time McMurray joined other RLDS supporters of the New Mormon History to found the JWHA, serving as its president in 1981. He continued to present and publish influential articles, while also serving in high church offices. As church president, he presented a paper to the JWHA in 1999, as a response to an earlier critique of the RLDS Church, where he stated that his past historical research had influenced the positions he took as church president. In 2006, after resigning the presidency, McMurray was able to speak frankly about Joseph Smith's polygamy at the JWHA, which had so troubled the church in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe JWHA is considered an important professional venue within the Latter Day Saint historical community. Historians from different backgrounds connect and share research, and develop scholarship. JWHA is often a venue for research which is later published in book form by a scholarly press. For example, Jan Shipps, a non-Mormon scholar, opened the first JWHA conference in 1973 with a paper entitled \"The Prophet Puzzle,\" which was then picked up the next year by the Mormon History Association as the head article in the inaugural issue of the \"Journal of Mormon History\". Years later the paper was again highlighted in the Essays on Mormonism Series published by Signature Books. In another example from the 1973 JWHA conference, Lawrence Foster, another non-Mormon, shared his research on polygamy with LDS Assistant Church Historian Davis Bitton. Bitton invited Foster to the LDS archives in Salt Lake City, Utah, leading to Foster's first published book.\n\nSince its founding, the JWHA has worked closely with its \"sister organization\", the Utah-based Mormon History Association. The two organizations have held a joint conference and have long offered joint memberships. Many MHA members are also JWHA members, or also members of the Utah State Historical Society, all three of which Jan Shipps called \"Mormon to the core\". Several presidents of the MHA have also been presidents of the JWHA, as well as one BYU religion professor. In addition to the MHA, the JWHA has also co-sponsored conferences with the Sunstone Educational Foundation and collaborated with the Mormon Missouri Frontier Foundation, including an archaeological dig at Haun's Mill in 2002.\n\nThe JWHA and MHA fostered an interfaith dialogue that helped thaw relations between the LDS and RLDS. Each organization published research and reviewed books by members of both faiths. This complimented the trust developed in the 1960s between Richard Howard, the RLDS Church Historian, and Robert Matthews, an LDS researcher of Joseph Smith's Bible translation manuscript, held in the RLDS collections. From this goodwill, the RLDS Church approved Matthews' research for publication in the official LDS Edition of the Bible in 1979.\n\nWhile it is most often compared to the MHA, the role of the JWHA has also been compared to other organizations within the historical community. This includes the Sunstone Education Foundation, the Dialogue Foundation, Signature Books, the Utah State Historical Society (and other Utah history groups), the LDS Church History Department, and Brigham Young University institutions like the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute, the Charles Redd Center, the Religious Studies Center, and the BYU history department. Also compared are societies beyond Mormon studies, such as the American Historical Association, the American Academy of Religion, the Western History Association, and the Communal Studies Association.\n\nThe JWHA began publishing the John Whitmer Historical Association Journal (\"JWHA Journal\") in 1981. It followed several Mormon studies journals founded in the 1960s and 1970s, including \"Courage\" and \"Restoration Studies\" by RLDS scholars. The \"Journal of Mormon History\" already provided a venue for historians, but there was room for another history journal in the wake of the New Mormon History and a proliferation of scholarly writing in the 1970s.\n\nFor many years the \"JWHA Journal\" was published annually in October (but is now semiannual) with scholarly papers, book reviews, and other features. It often contains papers from the JWHA conferences, and sometimes articles are later reprinted in \"Restoration Studies\" for a more general audience. Subscriptions are included with all JWHA memberships.\n\nWhile maintaining a special focus on Community of Christ history, the \"Journal\" publishes on all areas of Mormon history, drawing interest from LDS historians. Although founded by Community of Christ scholars, a significant proportion of the articles and reviews are written by LDS or non-Mormon contributors.\n\nThe \"JWHA Journal\" is peer-reviewed with a reputation for strong scholarship and as a major publication in its field. It is compared to Mormon studies journals, like \"Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought\", the \"Journal of Mormon History\", \"Sunstone\", \"BYU Studies\", the \"Utah Historical Quarterly\", \"Exponent II\" and the RLDS journals \"Courage: A Journal of History, Thought and Action\" and \"Restoration Studies\". Also compared are non-Mormon journals, like the \"Journal of the Early Republic\", the \"Illinois Historical Journal\", and \"Church History\".\n\nThe JWHA holds its annual meeting at a different historic site within Mormon history, on the last full weekend in September. Professional and independent historians from the Community of Christ, and elsewhere, present their research to an attendance of around 100. Scholars are introduced to each other and to new research. As many attendees are believers at different levels of faith, Jan Shipps observed that JWHA and MHA conferences can sometimes serve as quasi-religious support groups when faith is challenged by history, with non-LDS providing a neutral space.\n\nAside from the annual meeting and \"Journal\", the JWHA is involved in several other activities. Scholarships are offered to students working on Mormon history, allowing them to attend and present to the conference. Awards are also presented by the JWHA for best books and articles in Mormon history. These are found alongside other awards in Mormon studies, such as those from the MHA and the Utah State Historical Society, the Dialogue Foundation, and the Evans Biography Award.\n\nThe JWHA hosts a scholarly lecture at its Spring Banquet, held in Independence, Missouri, before each triennial World Conference of the Community of Christ, during a time when church members and leaders are gathered to the city.\n\nIn 2005, the JWHA founded John Whitmer Books, a publishing imprint for scholarly titles in Mormon Studies. The JWHA also publishes a newsletter irregularly (intended to be quarterly), which started in 1979, and has been joint publisher of \"Restoration Studies\" since 2009.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "44613190", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44613190", "title": "Mediacracy", "text": "Mediacracy\n\nMediacracy is a situation in government where the mass media effectively has control over the voting public. Mediacracy is closely related to a theory on the role of media in the United States political system, that argues that media and news outlets have a large level of influence over voting citizens' evaluations of candidates and political issues, thereby possessing effective control over politics in the United States.\n\nThe term \"mediacracy\" was first coined in 1974 by writer and political commentator Kevin Phillips, who used the term in the title of his book \"Mediacracy: American Parties and Politics in the Communications Age\". Since then, the concept has gained popularity and is used by political scientists and researchers alike to discuss the impact of media on both voting behavior and cultural trends. Most recently, the term has seen a resurgence due to the works of economist and author Fabian Tassano. In his book \"Mediocracy: Inversions and Deceptions in an Egalitarian Culture\" Tassano argues that the 'dumbing down' of popular media when coupled with increasing obscurity in scholarly discourse leads to a society which has the appearance of egalitarianism, but ultimately is a society ruled by elites. As a reflection of this, the term mediacracy is usually accompanied by negative assumptions about the true nature of media in the United States, along with the aims and desires of mass media as a whole.\n\nThere are three main potential causes for the rise in the media's influence on elections, being a combination of different theories on the cultural influence of mass media and recent populist democratic reforms in the American political system. Supporters of the mediacracy theory argue that when taken together, these causes greatly show that the media have a large level of influence over politics in the United States, drawing a link between media's leverage on public opinion, and the increased power that public opinion has on who is elected to office. These potential causes include, but are not limited to:\n\nAgenda-setting refers to the ability of the media to affect the salience of issues on the public agenda. In short, the amount of attention paid to a certain issue will lead to audiences viewing that issue as more important. The theory of agenda-setting was formally developed by Dr. Max McCombs and Dr. Donald Shaw in their study on the 1968 presidential election conducted at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. McCombs and Shaw polled 100 residents of the Chapel Hill community and found a strong correlation between what those residents believed to be the most important election issue, and what local and national media outlets reported as the most important election issue. This was a landmark study that displayed a link between an issue's salience in media content and the corresponding salience of that issue in voter's minds.\n\nAs of 2005, over 400 studies have discussed the presence of agenda-setting, and the issue remains relevant to the study of the American political system.\n\nPriming, in a political context is a theory stating that the media draws attention to some issues as opposed to others, thereby altering the standards by which we judge candidates in elections. Priming is often used in concert with agenda setting in the media, and the two concepts taken together contribute to a full understanding of the level of influence that the mass media holds over the voting public. This theory on media originated from researchers Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder in their work \"Experimental Demonstrations of the \"Not-So-Minimal\" Consequences of Television News Programs\" published in the 1982 edition of The American Political Science Review. Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder argue that due to media making certain issues more salient than others, they set the parameters of the political decisions made by the voting public.\n\nWhile priming is often unintentional, Iyengar, Peters, and Kinder's 1982 study examines how intentional priming can shape the public's evaluations of candidates and elected officials. The researchers looked at how the salience of certain topics affected voters' evaluations of President Jimmy Carter, and found evidence to support the presence of both agenda setting and priming. Iyengar et al. first proved the effects of agenda setting by finding a correlation between the attention paid to certain political topics and those topics' importance with the voting public when evaluating the President. The researchers then found evidence of priming by finding a link between those established standards, and voters' resulting evaluations of President Carter.\n\nSupporters of the mediacracy theory largely point to this joint phenomenon as evidence that the mass media holds a large amount of control over the voting population.\n\nOver the course of the last half century, there have been a number of reforms that have led to a shift in control over candidate selection from party elites to the voting public. Thomas Patterson examines this shift, and its resulting correlation with rising political influence of the mass media, in his book \"Out of Order\". From 1960 to 1980, the number of bound or committed delegates in both parties more than doubled, going from 20% on the Democratic side and 35% on the Republican side to 71% and 69% for each respectively in 1980. Also, from 1960 to 2004, the number of states holding primary contests (which favor public opinion) instead of caucuses (which favor party elites) has more than doubled. Patterson argues that this shift has indirectly strengthened the power of media outlets that have been shown to have much influence over citizens' evaluations of candidates, and as such the media holds much sway in the American political system, despite relatively low levels of political accountability.\n\nMost researchers who discuss the theory of mediacracy agree that media control of the American political system would lead to a decline in objective, rational information sharing in politics at best, and a society that is controlled by the owners of large media conglomerates at worst. However, it is important to remember that the theory of mediacracy as it is popularly discussed is accompanied by very negative assumptions about the true nature of media in the United States, which affects the predilections that researchers make about the future.\n\nPaul Kurtz argues that current media trends emphasizing sensationalization tend to appeal to the lowest common denominator, which would contribute to a decline in the level of education and reflective cognitive thought of media consumers. Kurtz also argues that growing media consolidation harms diversity of opinion in society, and that the focus of media conglomerates on maximizing profits will lead to advertiser control over information obtained through media outlets. This sentiment is greatly echoed by Fabian Tassano, who goes on to speculate that eventually a privileged elite of informed citizens will have control over society.\n\nThe primary complaint against the theory of mediacracy is that researchers who support the theory are vastly overstating the effects of media influence. Sharon Meraz argues in her study \"The fight for 'how to think': Traditional media, social networks, and issue interpretation\" that due to rising fragmentation in information control during the age of the internet, there is \"weakening influence of elite, traditional media as a singular power in influencing issue interpretation within networked political environments.\". In her study Meraz effectively shows that emerging technologies have reduced the power of media elites, leading to a decline in the hegemonic level of control central to the theories of most supporters of the mediacracy theory. Whether this is a permanent change, or a temporary result of new technology that will be eventually co-opted by media elites, is yet to be determined.\n\n"}

Instead, the task of setting minimum wages is delegated to the local governments. Each province, municipality, or region sets its own minimum wage in accordance with its own local conditions. According to the country's Employment Promotion Plan, minimum wages are supposed to increase in accordance with local living standards by at least 13 percent through 2015 and be no less than 40 percent of the average local wages. Minimum wages under such policies increased by an average 12.6 percent rate between 2008-2012. However, the growth rate of minimum wage levels decreased in 2016, reflecting the Chinese government’s effort to reduce pressure on enterprises resulting from the uneven growth between labor costs and production rates.\n\nThe overall trends for the change of minimum wage levels diverge across provinces, with much smaller increases in developed regions and more rapid growth in less developed regions. From June 2015 and June 2016, 22 regions made changes to their minimum wage levels. In 2016, the average growth rate dropped to 14.5 percent from 17 percent in 2015. It is noteworthy that the Guangdong provincial government announced that it would maintain 2015 minimum wage levels in 2016 and 2017, and the minimum wage growth rate in Shanghai has decreased from 12.3 in 2015 to 8.4 percent in 2016.

{"id": "33079593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33079593", "title": "Organizational information theory", "text": "Organizational information theory\n\nOrganizational Information Theory (OIT) is a communication theory, developed by Karl Weick, offering systemic insight into the processing and exchange of information within organizations and among its members. Unlike the past structure-centered theory, OIT focuses on the process of organizing in dynamic, information-rich environments. Given that, It contents that the main activity of organizations is the process of making sense of equivocal information. Organizational members are instrumental to reduce equivocality and achieve sensemaking through some strategies — enactment, selection, and retention of information. With a framework that is interdisciplinary in nature, organizational information theory's desire to eliminate both ambiguity and complexity from workplace messaging builds upon earlier findings from general systems theory and phenomenology.\n\n1. Human organizations exist in an information environment\n\nUnlike senders and receivers models, OIT stands on the situational perspective. Karl Weick views a human organization as an open social system. People in that system develop a mechanism to establish goals, obtain and process information, or perceive the environment. In this process, people and the environment come to conclusions on \"what's going on here?\". Colville believes that this attributional process is retrospective.\n\nTake an education institutions as an example. A university can obtain information regarding students' needs in numerous ways. It might create feedback section in its website. It could organize alumni panels or academic affairs to attract prospective students and collect concrete questions they are interested in. It may also conduct the survey or host focus group to get the information. After that, the stuff of the university have to decide how to deal with these information, based on which, it has to set and accomplish its goals for current and prospective students.\n\n2. The information an organization receives differs in terms of equivocality\n\nWeick's posits that numerous feasible interpretations of reality exist when organizations process information. Their varying levels of understandability lead to different outcomes of information inputs. In other academic works, scholars tend to say that messages are uncertain or ambiguous. While according to OIT, messages are described to be equivocal. believes that people proactively exclude a number of possibilities to perceive what is going on in the environment. Due to OIT's situational perspective, the meanings of messages consist of the messages, the interpretations of receivers, and the interactional context. However, ambiguity and uncertainty can mean that a standard answer - the only one true objective interpretation - exists. \n\nAlso, Weick emphasizes that \"the equivocality is the engine that motivates people to organize\". Maitlis and Christianson states that the equivocality trigger sensemaking for three reasons: environment jolts and organizational crises, threats to identity, and planned change interventions. \n\n3. Human organizations engage in information processing to reduce equivocality of information\n\nBased upon the first two assumption, OIT proposes that information processing within organizations is a social activity. Sharing is the key feature of organizational information processing. In that particular context, members jointly make sense the reality by reducing equivocality. It other words, the sensemaking is a joint responsibility which includes numerous interdependent people to accomplish. In this process, organizations and its members combine actions and attributions together in order to find the balance between the complexity of thoughts and the simplicity of actions.\n\nIn order to place Weick's vision regarding Organizational Information Theory into proper working context, exploring his view regarding what constitutes the organization and how its individuals embody that construct might yield significant insights.\n\nFrom a fundamental standpoint, he shared a belief that organizational validation is derived---not through bricks and mortar, or locale—but from a series of events which enable entities to \"collect, manage and use the information they receive.\" In elaborating further on what constitutes an organization during early writings outlining OIT, Weick said, \"The word organization is a noun and it is also a myth. if one looks for an organization, one will not find it. What will be found is that there are events linked together, that transpire within concrete walls and these sequences, their pathways, their timing, are the forms we erroneously make into substances when we talk about an organization\".\n\nWhen viewed in this modular fashion, the organization meets Weick's theoretical vision by encompassing parameters that are less bound by concrete, wood, and structural restraints and more by an ability to serve as a repository where information can be consistently and effectively channeled. Taking these defining characteristics into account, proper channel execution relies on maximization of messaging clarity, context, delivery and evolution through any system.\n\nOne example as to how these interactions might unfold on a more granular level within these confines can be gleaned through Weick's double interact loop, which he considers the \"building blocks of every organization\". Simply put, double interacts describe interpersonal exchanges that, inherently, occur across the organizational chain of command and in life, itself.\n\nThus:\n\n\"An act occurs when you say something (Can I have a Popsicle?).\n\nAn interact occurs when you say something \"and I respond\" (\"No, it will spoil your dinner).\n\nA double interact occurs when you say something, I respond to that, then \"you respond to that, adjusting the first statement\" (\"Well, how about half a Popsicle?)\n\nWeick envisions the organization as a system taking in equivocal information from its environment, trying to make sense of that information, and using what was learned for the future. As such, organizations evolve as they make sense out of themselves and the environment\".\n\n\"These communication cycles are the reason Weick focuses more on relationships within an organization than he does on an individual's talent or performance. He believes that many outside consultants gloss over the importance of the double interact because they depart the scene before the effects of their recommended action bounce back to affect the actor\". By allowing us to consider the organization in this alternative framework, Organizational Information Theory provides us with a robust platform from which to explore the communication process, literally, as it unfolds.\n\nIn developing Organizational Information Theory, Weick took a \"social psychological stance that notes that individual behavior is more a function of the situation than of personal traits or role definitions. Therefore, people are 'loosely connected' in most organizations and have a large latitude for action\". As a way of formalizing this phenomenon, he \"invites us to use the metaphor \"loose coupling\" in order to better understand organizations and aspects of organizations --particularly the variant kinds of connections that exist within organizations--that are either marginalized, ignored, or suppressed by normative bureaucracy\".\n\nSo, in much the same way he suggested that organizations be viewed through a non-traditional lens in structure, he acknowledges that, by doing so, one may have to consider circumstances where \"several means can produce the same result, while offering the appearance that lack of coordination, absence of regulations, and very slow feedback times are the norm\".\n\nWhile many might view these nuances as roadblocks or impediments to progress, Organizational Information Theory views each one as a catalyst for improved performance and positive change through: \"increased sensitivity to a shifting environment, room for adaptation and creative solutions to develop, sub-system breakdown without damaging the entire organization, persistence through rapid environmental fluctuations and fostering an attitude where self-determination by the actors is key\".\n\nAnother overriding component of Weick's approach is that information afforded by the organization's environment---including the culture within the organizational environment itself---can impact the behaviors and interpretation of behaviors of those within the organization. Thus, creation of organizational knowledge is impacted by each person’s personal schema as well as the backdrop of the organization’s objectives. The organization must sift through the available information to filter out the valuable from the extraneous. Additionally, the organization must both interpret the information and coordinate that information to \"make it meaningful for the members of the organization and its goals.\" In order to construct meaning from these messages in their environment, the organization must reduce equivocality, while committing to an interpretation of the message which matches its culture and overall mission.\n\nAccordingly, the \"flashlight analogy\" is used to explain the inseparability of action and knowledge present in this theory. One should imagine he is in a dark field at night with only a flashlight. He can vaguely pick out objects around him, but can't really tell what they are. Is that lump in the distance a bush or a dangerous animal? When he turns on his flashlight, however, he creates a circle of light that allows him to see clearly and act with relative clarity. The act of turning on the flashlight effectively created a new environment that allowed him to interpret the world around him. There is still only a single circle of light, though, and what remains outside that circle is still just as mysterious, unless the flashlight is redirected. With organizational information theory, the flashlight is mental. The environment is located in the mind of the actor and is imposed on him by his experiences, which makes them more meaningful.\n\nBased on the number of rapidly moving parts within any organization (i.e., information flows, individuals, etc...) the foundation upon which messaging is received constantly shifts, thus leaving room for unintended consequences relative to true intent and meaning. Equivocality arises when communication outreach \"can be given different interpretations because their substance is ambiguous, conflicted, obscure, or introduces uncertainty into a situation\".\n\nOrganizational Information Theory provides a knowledge base and framework which can help mitigate these risks through by decreasing the level of ambiguity present during relevant communication activities. Simultaneously, it serves as a construct whose potential for growth stems from active use \"communicating and organizing\" and \"reducing the amount of equivocality\" within a specified domain.\n\nIn looking at how equivocality evolves more closely, it can also manifest itself as a signature for highly interpretive events, along with those where the parameters (and uncertainty levels) are, traditionally, much more concrete. For instance, \"equivocality also describes situations where there is agreement on a set of descriptive criteria (say, desirable market/undesirable market) but disagreement on either their boundaries (i.e., the point at which markets go from being desirable to undesirable) or on their application to a particular situation (whether a particular market is desirable or undesirable). Managing equivocality requires coordinating meaning among members of an organization, and is an essential part of organizing. Equivocality arises because everyone's experiences are unique; individuals and communities develop their own sets of values and beliefs and tend to interpret events differently. Equivocality also may result from unreliable or conflicting information sources, noisy communication channels, differing or ambiguous goals and preferences, vague roles and responsibilities, or disparate political interests\".\n\nKarl Weick's Organizational Information Theory views organizations as \" 'sensemaking systems' which incessantly create and re-create conceptions of themselves and of all around them\".\n\nFrom a less clinical (and more intuitive) perspective, Weick and his collaborator, Kathleen M. Sutcliffe, jointly describe sensemaking as an action which \"involves turning circumstances into a situation that is comprehended explicitly in words or speech and that serves as a springboard to action\".\n\nIn its more defined organizational context, sensemaking can be looked at as a process \"that is applied to both individuals and groups who are faced with new information that is inconsistent with their prior beliefs\". In factoring the uneasiness (or cognitive dissonance) that results from this experience, they will create narratives to fit the story which serve both as a buffer and a guiding light for further renditions of the story. \"This explains how, for example, religious groups can have such stringent beliefs, how political parties can be confident in their diametrically-opposed positions, how organizations can develop very different cultures, and how individuals can develop very different interpretations for the same event\".\n\nThe process of sensemaking usually starts with a circumstance or problem which requires a certain level of interpretation by others (i.e., something did or did not happen). Whether it is consciously or unconsciously driven, those involved then make a commitment to a perceived viewpoint surrounding those facts. \"Commitment forms around the interpretation to bind the interpretation to future action. When publicly communicated, commitment is especially strong. Individuals are motivated to justify their commitments, so they initiate future actions and continually refine their interpretation of the original event so that their commitment to a course of action is deemed appropriate. These new actions produce \"evidence\" that validates the interpretation and are used to increase decision confidence\".\n\nThese are critical facets which surround the sensemaking process:\n\na) sensemaking starts with noticing and bracketing\n\nb) sensemaking is about labeling\n\nc) sensemaking is retrospective\n\nd) sensemaking is about presumption\n\ne) sensemaking is social and systemic\n\nf) sensemaking is about action\n\ng) sensemaking is about organizing through communication\n\nThe idea of sensemaking is also a theme within Organizational Information Theory. Organizational sensemaking contrasts with organizational interpretation. When an organization interprets information, there is already a frame of reference in place and this is enough information for an organization to change course. Sensemaking occurs, however, when no initial frame of reference exists and no obvious connection presents itself. According to Weick, sensemaking can be driven by beliefs or actions. Beliefs shape what people experience and give form for the actions they take. For example, disagreement about beliefs in an organization can lead to arguments. This is a form of sensemaking.\n\nNotably, sensemaking make impact on organizations in three aspects: strategic change, organizational learning, and innovation and creativity. Regarding strategic change, individuals are triggered to alter their own roles and behaviors and also help others to coordinate with their new changes. Then a new organizational order about strategies will be constructed. As for learning, on the one hand, people will learn from error. Organizational understandings and routines will be revised, updated and strengthened in response to the errors. On the other hand, sensemaking about material gathered and available options make a great contribution to learn in more conventional contexts, especially in knowledge-intensive work settings. The details about its impact on innovation can be seen in \"extension\" section.\n\nWhen information messaging remains an unclear variable, organizations will usually revert to a number of Organizational Information Theory-based methodologies which are designed to encourage ambiguity reduction:\n\n1. Choice Points--Describes an organization's decision to ask: \"should we attend to some aspect of our environment that was rejected before?\" Re-tracing one's steps can provide both management and individuals with a comfort zone in addressing frequency and volume regarding messaging, lest anything have been missed.\n\n2. Behavior Cycles--Represents \"deliberate communication activities on the part of an organization to decrease levels of ambiguity\". Importantly, degrees of messaging equivocality have a direct impact on how many cycles are required to alleviate its effects. Within this realm, three distinct steps emerge that are each focused on providing messaging clarity: act, response and adjustment. Each is designed to facilitate the retention and selection process. Examples of behavior cycles include staff meetings, coffee-break rumoring, e-mail conversations, internal reports, etc..\n\n3. Assembly Rules--Signifies a broader construct, \"which may include evaluating how standard operating procedures (SOP) are carried out, along with chain-of-command designations\". By its nature, this approach explores protocol measures that might be effective in handling ambiguity, as well as, how related processes might unfold.\n\nThree critical principles, or relationship, guide the the process of equivocality reduction. They are: the relationship among equivocality, the rules and the cycles must be carefully analyzed; the relationship between the number of rules and amount of cycles; the relationship between the number of cycles and the amount of equivocality. \n\nTo be specific, Weick posits that the amount of perceived equivocality influence the number of rules. Generally speaking, there is a negative correlation between the level of equivocality and the amount of rules. To be specific, the more equivocal the message is, the few rules are available to process that information. Meanwhile, an inverse relationship also exists between rules and cycles. In other words, fewer rules lead to more use of cycles. Then, the increasing number of cycles used can reduce the equivocality.\n\nAccording to Weick, organizations experience continuous change and are ever-adapting, as opposed to a change followed by a period of stagnancy. Building off of Orlikowski’s idea that the changes that take place are not necessarily planned, but rather inevitably occur over time, Organizational Information Theory explains how organizations use information found within the environment to interpret and adjust to change. In the event that the information available in the information environment is highly equivocal, the organization engages in a series of cycles that serve as a means to reduce uncertainty about the message. A highly equivocal message might require several iterations of the behavior cycles. An inverse relationship exists between the number of rules established by the organization to reduce equivocality and the number of cycles necessary to reduce equivocality. Similarly, the more cycles used, the less equivocality remains.\n\nEnactment \n\nWeick emphasizes the role of action, or enactment in change within an organization. Through a combination of individuals with existing data and external knowledge, and through iterative process of trial and error, ideas are refined until they become actualized. Enactment also plays a key role in the idea of sensemaking, the process by which people give meaning to experience. Essentially, the action helps to define the meaning, making those within the organization's environment responsible for the environment itself.\n\nSelection \n\nUpon analyzing the information the organization possesses, the selection stage includes evaluation of outstanding information necessary to further reduce equivocality. The organization must decide the best method for obtaining the remaining information. Generally, the decision-makers of the organization play a key role in this stage.\n\nThere are three critical processes happening in this stage: 1) members make a choice among interpretations; 2) members choose the type and amount of rules for processing those interpretations; 3) communication cycles start to work on those interpretations.\n\nRetention \n\nThe final stage occurs when the organization sifts through the information it has compiled in attempts to adapt to change, and determines which information is beneficial and worth utilizing again. Inefficient, superfluous and otherwise unnecessary information that do not contribute to the completion of the project or reduction of equivocality will most likely not be retained for future application of similar project.\n\nOne of the key real-world applications regarding Weick's concept of Organizational Information Theory can be found in healthcare. There, he went so far as to personally develop a dedicated health communications approach which \"emphasizes the central role of communication and information processing within social groups and institutions\". Specifically, Weick's work draws correlations between accuracy of information and the ability of organizations to adapt to change.\n\nWeick's model of organizing plays a powerful role in improving communication of health care and health promotion. The OIT enables consumers and providers to reduce equivocality when they face complex health care and health promotion situations. \"In health care and health promotion, enactment processes are used to make sense of different health-related challenges, selection processes are used to choose different courses of action in response to these challenges, and retention processes are used to preserve what was learned from enactment and selection processes for guiding future health care/promotion activities\".\n\nFor instance, the theory can evaluate the problems of excessive nurse turnover in public hospital and develop interventions to address the problems. Hospital administrators used to deal with the problem by making efforts in recruiting nurses. Although the strategy attracted more new nurses, it was expensive to maintain the recruitment efforts. Thus, a retention program was generated under the Weick's model of organizing. The program used questionnaires, in-depth interviews and focus group discussion to figure out nurses' concerns (enactment). The research's results identified strategies to solve those problems (selection). Then the program gathered further information about nurses' attitude and advice for these strategies and implemented refined strategies (retention).\n\nSome scholars advocate that loosely coupled system and garbage can model guarantee the flexibility of higher education organizations. Proponents of loose coupling system believe that the university's academic freedom and students' individual identity will be destroyed if administrators tighten up the loose coupling. However, Weick argues that the \"unpredictability (of an organization) is insufficient evidence for concluding that the elements in a system are loosely coupled\". Other scholars notice the Weick's warning that loose coupling should not be used as a normative model. Universities will not lose their academic freedom with a tighter coupled system. Frank W. states that \"They (universities) are tightly coupled in some aspects and uncoupled in other aspects. Tight coupling occurs when an issue supports the status quo. Uncoupling occurs when an issue challenges the status quo\".\n\nWeick's model of organizing can be applied to reduce equivocality in the large-lecture classroom and to increase students' engagement. Large-lecture classroom can be recognized as an information environment with various degrees of equivocality. Students enact assembly rules to make sense of messages in class with low equivocality. Behavior cycles which focus on act, response and adjustment can be utilized by students to clarify messages with high equivocality. \"Students assess how the applied rules and cycles affected their ability to interpret the original input's equivocality and decide if additional rules and cycles are needed to develop an effective response to the input\". Some students feel intimidated when they raise questions in the large-lecture classroom. Thus, the synchronicity and anonymous nature of microblog make itself a second channel to facilitate students' question asking as well as decreases their equivocality. Faculty enables to retain organizational intelligence through microblog format.\n\nIt is difficult to find two parties share exact same interest. Thus, conflict and cooperation coexist with each other in organizations. Institutionalized conflict management is frequently used by managers to create sustained organizations. Metaphors provides a comprehensive approach to understand and interpret the information environment which includes new knowledge and new practices. \"Metaphor created by subsidiary representatives of the conflict management practice reflects the quality and the depth of institutionalization\". Metaphors can be recognized as a collective sensemaking and a depict of organizational environment. Individuals are able to make decisions which depends on their metaphors about conflict in organizations.\n\nThis theory focuses on the process of communication instead of the role of individual actors. It examines the complexities of information processing in lieu of trying to understand people within a group or organization. Additionally, this theory closely examines the act of organizing, rather than organizations themselves. Weick defines organizing as, \"the resolving of equivocality in an enacted environment by means of interlocked behaviors embedded in conditionally related process\" and that, \"human beings organize primarily to help them reduce the information uncertainty in their lives\".\n\nSome scholars argue that this theory fails the test of logical consistency and that people are not necessarily guided by rules in an organization. Some organizational members might not have any interest in communication rules and their actions might have more to do with intuition than anything else.\n\nOther critics posit that organizational information theory views the organization as a static entity, rather than one that changes over time. Dynamic adjustments, such as downsizing, outsourcing and even advancements in technology should be taken into consideration when examining an organization—and organizational information theory does not account for this.\n\nCritics of this theory assert that it does not deal significantly with hierarchy or conflict, two prominent themes associated with organizational communications. In some cases, the hierarchical context makes difficulties for sensemaking and proposes a flow of downward negative feedback. Sensemaking process can be applied to explain why employees remain silence in the organization. Two sensemaking resources which are expectation and identity preclude employees from giving upward negative feedback. Employees expect that their negative feedback for supervisors will pose threat to their job security or might be neglected by supervisors. Besides, employees make sense of their own understanding and identify themselves as deficient experts who are unable to make best decisions.\n\nThe theory also neglects the larger social, historical and institutional context. The role of the institutional context and cultural-cognitive institutions in sensemaking should be paid more attention to. According to Taylor and Van Every, \"what is missing [in Weick’s 1995 \"Sensemaking in Organizations\" version of enactment] ... is an understanding of the organization as a communicational construction or an awareness of the institutionalizing of human society that accompanies organization with its many internal contradictions and tensions\". Actors are constrained by cognition through socialization in the job, school system and the media when they do sensemaking in institutions. It causes less variety and more stability in institutions. In order to expand the theory, social mechanism can be applied to consider how institutions prime, edit and trigger sensemaking besides the traditional cognitive constraint.\n\nAs an adjunct to Weick's work regarding organizational information, noted academician (and fellow researcher), Dr. Brenda Dervin, followed a similar path in exploring how ambiguity and uncertainty are handled across platforms.\n\nHowever, in broaching these issues from a more communication-driven perspective Dr. Dervin found that these issues evolve from a different place; one, in fact, that unlike Weick, assumes \"discontinuity between entities, times and spaces\". Instead of modularity, \"each individual is an entity moving through time and space, dealing with other entities which include other people, artifacts, systems, or institutions. The individual's making of sense as a strategy for bridging these gaps is the central metaphor of the Sense-Making Approach\".\n\nBy utilizing this alternate prism, Dr. Dervin found that \"patterns of gap-bridging behavior are better-predicted by the way individuals define the gaps in which they find themselves, than by any attributes that might be typically used to define individuals across space and time, such as demographic categories or personality indicators. Situations and people are constantly changing, but patterns of interaction between people and situations as they are defined by people seem to be somewhat more stable\".\n\n\"In 2000, the researchers Doughtery, Borrelli, Munir and O'Sullivan discovered that the level of innovation capability within organizations was connected to the ability of making \"the right\" sense of collective experiences in uncertain or ambiguous situations such as radical changes in the market or technology paradigm shifts\".\n\nInstinctively, it seems, the sensemaking systems of less innovative companies appeared to be inhibited by tendencies to \"play within existing rules...filter out unexpected information or unorthodox competency sets, resulting in groupthink and more of the same\". Meanwhile, \"innovative organizations ...dared to challenge existing business logic and made use of new insights\"...these, in turn, were used to \"change existing interpretations and schemes and thus, influence the overall evolvement of the organization so that the interpretation schemes themselves became more apt to deal with outside forces\".\n\nWeick proposes three dynamics which are closely relevant to innovation: \"that the knowledge is both tacit and articulated, that linking processes cut across several levels of organizational action, and that linking processes embody several tensions\". A study applies these dynamics and organizational sensemaking to analyze how people make sense of market and technology knowledge for product innovation. Innovative organizations have a system of sensemaking that allows actors to \"construct, bracket, interpret, and rethink the right kinds of market and technology knowledge in the right way for innovation\". However, actors in non-innovative organizations make sense of knowledge in a separate way.\n\n\"See also\": \n\nComputer-mediated communication have gradually become an essential part of communication in current work context and organizational settings. Weick proposes that sensemaking away from terminals experiences five procedures: effectuate, triangulate, affiliate, deliberate, and consolidate.\n\nAccording to Garphart, compared with in traditional workplace, sensemaking in electronically enabled work place becomes more complex and ambigous. and act differently in the above five procedures. To be specific. four distinct features can be seen. Firstly, the process of reciprocity is much confined. The reciprocity of perspectives might be delayed when communicators are at different \"terminals\". Also, sensory cues are nearly absent in this process, while textual communication is commonly used. In other words communication modes are limited. Secondly, the levels of equivocality and the difficulties of sensemaking increase. The problems of understanding computer or new technical terms emerge as a new obstacle to be overcome for achieving sensemaking in organizations. Thirdly, less etcetera principles can be used to in CMC. In other words, CMC tend to build up a rigidly structured communication environment, due to which, people will find it harder to gain additional information from outside the computer system. Lastly, CMC alters the occupational tasks. Some technical background or computer-related knowledge are required to support general occupational tasks.\n\nThere are two major models proposed to explain the sensemaking with CMC in organizations: Weick's cognitive model and a social interaction model. \n\nWeick believes that people will increasingly encounter with problems to make sense information with new technology. Cognitive Model posits states that new computer technologies have a huge impact on sensemaking in organizations in five aspects. First, actions deficiencies always happen because real objects can not be fully captured and represented by simulated images and symbols. Second, comparisons are often deficient due to limited reciprocity of perspectives and nearly absent feedback based on direct action. Third, works at terminals are always solitary and will decrease affiliation of communication. Fourth, constant inflow of information in computer interrupt or even prevent the deliberation. Lastly, sensemaking at terminals always leads to consolidation deficiencies due to self-contained nature of computer. \n\nSocial Interactional Model, deriving from phenomenological sociology and ethnomethodology, emphasizes the intersubjective and objective features of sensemaking. Intersubjective feature reveals that people always try to obtain subjective meanings of others. In CMC, communicators are required to actively figure out whether they share meanings with others, including computers. In this process, people are expected to use normal form objects, terms and utterances to portray correctly the contexts and experiences in order to let computer recognize. However, increasing number of knowledge are needed to achieve sensemaking than that in traditional workplace. Thus, etcetera principle come into use to deal with vague or implicit meanings. People will actively seek additional information to clarify the meanings. Meanwhile, descriptive vocabularies are used as indexical expressions to assist people to resolve equivocal meanings based on contextual, cultural, technical knowledge and information. \n\n\n"}

Questions can thus be understood as a kind of illocutionary act in the field of pragmatics or as special kinds of propositions in frameworks of formal semantics such as alternative semantics or inquisitive semantics. The information requested is expected to be provided in the form of an answer. Questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered. Conversely, non-interrogative grammatical structures may be considered questions as in the case of the imperative sentence \"tell me your name\".\n\nThe principal use of questions is to elicit information from the person being addressed by indicating the information which the speaker (or writer) desires . However, questions can also be used for a number of other purposes. Questions may be asked for the purpose of testing someone's knowledge, as in a quiz or examination. These are termed display questions . Raising a question may guide the questioner along an avenue of research (see Socratic method).\n\nA research question is an interrogative statement that manifests the objective or line of scholarly or scientific inquiry designed to address a specific gap in knowledge. Research questions are expressed in a language that is appropriate for the academic community that has the greatest interest in answers that would address said gap. These interrogative statements serve as launching points for the academic pursuit of new knowledge by directing and delimiting an investigation of a topic, a set of studies, or an entire program of research.\n\nA rhetorical question is asked to make a point, and does not expect an answer (often the answer is implied or obvious). As such, it is not a true question. Similarly, requests for things other than information, as with \"Would you pass the salt?\" are interrogative in form, but are not true questions.\n\nPre-suppositional or loaded questions, such as \"Have you stopped beating your wife?\" may be used as a joke or to embarrass an audience, because any answer a person could give would imply more information than he was willing to affirm.\n\nQuestions can also be used as titles of works of literature, art and scholarship. Examples include Leo Tolstoy's short story \"How Much Land Does a Man Need?\", the painting \"And When Did You Last See Your Father?\", the movie \"What About Bob?\", and the academic work \"Who Asked the First Question?\"\n\nVarious categorizations of questions have been proposed. With regard to research projects, one system distinguishes:\n\n\nFor the purpose of surveys, one type of question asked is the closed-ended (also \"closed\" or \"dichotomous\") question, usually requiring a yes/no answer or the choice of an option(s) from a list (see also multiple choice). There are also \"nominal questions\", designed to inquire about a level of quantitative measure, usually making connections between a number and a concept (as in \"1 = Moderate; 2 = Severe; 3 = ...\"). Open-ended or \"open\" questions give the respondent greater freedom to provide information or opinions on a topic. (The distinction between closed and open questions is applied in a variety of other contexts too, such as job interviewing.) Surveys also often contain \"qualifying questions\" (also called \"filter questions\" or \"contingency questions\"), which serve to determine whether the respondent needs to continue on to answer subsequent questions.\n\nSome types of questions that may be used in an educational context are listed in Bloom's Taxonomy of educational objectives. These include questions designed to test and promote:\n\n\nMcKenzie's \"Questioning Toolkit\" lists 17 types of questions, and suggests that thinkers need to orchestrate and combine these types. Examples of these question types include the \"irreverent question\", the \"apparently irrelevant question\", the \"hypothetical question\" and the \"unanswerable question\". Questions can also be infelicitous, being based on incorrect and illogical premises (e.g. \"Why do cats have green wings?\").\n\nStrategic studies also took into consideration the questioning process. In Humint (Human Intelligence), a taxonomy of questions includes:\n\nQuestions that ask whether or not some statement is true are called yes–no questions (or \"polar questions\", or \"general questions\"), since they can in principle be answered by a \"yes\" or \"no\" (or similar words or expressions in other languages). Examples include \"Do you take sugar?\", \"Should they be believed?\" and \"Am I the loneliest person in the world?\"\n\nA type of question that is similar in form to a yes–no question, but is not intended to be answered with a \"yes\" or \"no\", is the \"alternative question\" (or \"choice question\"). This presents two or more alternative answers, as in \"Do you want fish or lamb?\", or \"Are you supporting England, Ireland or Wales?\" The expected response is one of the alternatives, or some other indication such as \"both\" or \"neither\" (questionnaire forms sometimes contain an option \"none of the above\" or similar for such questions). Because of their similarity in form to yes–no questions, they may sometimes be answered \"yes\" or \"no\", possibly humorously or as a result of misunderstanding.\n\nThe other main type of question (other than yes–no questions) is those called \"wh\"-questions (or \"non-polar questions\", or \"special questions\"). These use interrogative words (\"wh\"-words) such as \"when\", \"which\", \"who\", \"how\", etc. to specify the information that is desired. (In some languages the formation of such questions may involve \"wh\"-movement – see the section below for grammatical description.) The name derives from the fact that most of the English interrogative words (with the exception of \"how\") begin with the letters \"wh\". These are the types of question sometimes referred to in journalism and other investigative contexts as the Five Ws.\n\nTag questions are a grammatical structure in which a declarative statement or an imperative is turned into a question by adding an interrogative fragment (the \"tag\"), such as \"right\" in \"You remembered the eggs, right?\", or \"isn't it\" in \"It's cold today, isn't it?\" Tag questions may or may not be answerable with a yes or no.\n\nAs well as direct questions (such as \"Where are my keys?\"), there also exist indirect questions (also called \"interrogative content clauses\"), such as \"where my keys are\". These are used as subordinate clauses in sentences such as \"I wonder where my keys are\" and \"Ask him where my keys are.\" Indirect questions do not necessarily follow the same rules of grammar as direct questions. For example, in English and some other languages, indirect questions are formed without inversion of subject and verb (compare the word order in \"where are they?\" and \"(I wonder) where they are\"). Indirect questions may also be subject to the changes of tense and other changes that apply generally to indirect speech.\n\nLanguages may use both syntax and prosody to distinguish interrogative sentences (which pose questions) from declarative sentences (which state propositions). Syntax refers to grammatical changes, such as moving words around or adding question words; prosody refers here to changes in intonation while speaking.\n\nIn English, German, French and various other languages, questions are marked by a distinct word order featuring inversion – the subject is placed after the verb rather than before it: \"You are cold\" becomes \"Are you cold?\" However, English allows such inversion only with a particular class of verbs (called auxiliary or special verbs), and thus sometimes requires the addition of an auxiliary \"do\", \"does\" or \"did\" before inversion can take place (\"He sings\" → \"Does he sing?\") – for details see \"do\"-support.\n\nIn some languages, yes–no questions are marked by an interrogative particle, such as the Japanese \"ka\", Mandarin \"ma\" and Polish \"czy\". Also, in languages generally, \"wh\"-questions are marked by an interrogative word (\"wh\"-word) such as \"what\", \"where\" or \"how\". In languages such as English this word generally moves to the front of the sentence (\"wh\"-fronting), and subject–verb inversion occurs as in yes–no questions, but in some other languages these changes in word order are not necessary (e.g. Mandarin \"nǐ yào shénme\", meaning \"what do you want?\" is literally \"you want what?\").\n\nIntonation patterns characteristic of questions often involve a raised pitch near the end of the sentence. In English this occurs especially for yes–no questions; it may also be used for sentences that do not have the grammatical form of questions, but are nonetheless intended to elicit information (declarative questions), as in \"You're not using this?\"\n\nIn languages written in Latin, Cyrillic or certain other scripts, a question mark at the end of a sentence identifies questions in writing. (In Spanish an additional inverted mark is placed at the beginning: \"¿Cómo está usted?\" \"How are you?\") As with intonation, this feature is not restricted to sentences having the grammatical form of questions – it may also indicate a sentence's pragmatic function.\n\nThe most typical response to a question is an answer that provides the information indicated as being sought by the questioner. This may range from a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" (in the case of yes–no questions) to a more complex or detailed answer. (An answer may be \"correct\" or \"incorrect\", depending on whether the information it presents is true or false.) An indication of inability or unwillingness to provide an answer is the other response to a question.\n\n\"Negative questions\" are interrogative sentences which contain negation in their phrasing, such as \"Shouldn't you be working?\" These can have different ways of expressing affirmation and denial from the standard form of question, and they can be confusing, since it is sometimes unclear whether the answer should be the opposite of the answer to the non-negated question. For example, if one does not have a passport, both \"Do you have a passport?\" and \"Don't you have a passport?\" are properly answered with \"No\", despite apparently asking opposite questions. The Japanese and Korean languages avoid this ambiguity. Answering \"No\" to the second of these in Japanese or Korean would mean, \"I \"do\" have a passport\".\n\nA similar ambiguous question in English is \"Do you mind if...?\" The responder may reply unambiguously \"Yes, I do mind,\" if they do mind, or \"No, I don't mind,\" if they don't, but a simple \"No\" or \"Yes\" answer can lead to confusion, as a single \"No\" can seem like a \"Yes, I do mind\" (as in \"No, please don't do that\"), and a \"Yes\" can seem like a \"No, I don't mind\" (as in \"Yes, go ahead\"). An easy way to bypass this confusion would be to ask a non-negative question, such as \"Is it all right with you if...?\"\n\nSome languages have different particles (for example the French \"\"si\", the German \"doch\" or the Danish and Norwegian \"jo\"\") to answer negative questions (or negative statements) in an affirmative way; they provide a means to express contradiction.\n\nMore information on these issues can be found in the articles yes–no question, yes and no, and answer ellipsis.\n\nQuestions are used from the most elementary stage of learning to original research. In the scientific method, a question often forms the basis of the investigation and can be considered a transition between the observation and hypothesis stages. Students of all ages use questions in their learning of topics, and the skill of having learners creating \"investigatable\" questions is a central part of inquiry education. The Socratic method of questioning student responses may be used by a teacher to lead the student towards the truth without direct instruction, and also helps students to form logical conclusions.\n\nA widespread and accepted use of questions in an educational context is the assessment of students' knowledge through exams.\n\nThe philosophical questions are conceptual, not factual questions. There are questions that are not fully answered by any other. Philosophy deals with questions that arise when people reflect on their lives and their world. Some philosophical questions are practical: for example, \"Is euthanasia justifiable?\", \"Does the state have the right to censor pornography or restrict tobacco advertising?\", \"To what extent are Māori and Pākehā today responsible for decisions made by their ancestors?\"\n\nOther philosophical questions are more theoretical, although they often arise through thinking about practical issues. The questions just listed, for example, may prompt more general philosophical questions about the circumstances under which it may be morally justifiable to take a life, or about the extent to which the state may restrict the liberty of the individual. Some \"classic\" questions of philosophy are speculative and theoretical and concern the nature of knowledge, reality and human existence: for example, \"What, if anything, can be known with certainty?\", \"Is the mind essentially non-physical?\", \"Are values absolute or relative?\", \"Does the universe need explanation in terms of a Supreme Intelligence?\", \"What, if anything, is the meaning or purpose of human existence?\" Finally, the philosophical questions are typically about conceptual issues; they are often questions about our concepts and the relation between our concepts and the world they represent. Every question implies a statement and every statement implies a question.\n\nEnculturated apes Kanzi, Washoe, Sarah and a few others who underwent extensive language training programs (with the use of gestures and other visual forms of communications) successfully learned to \"answer\" quite complex questions and requests (including question words \"who\" what\", \"where\"), although so far they failed to learn how to \"ask questions themselves\". For example, David and Anne Premack wrote: \"Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions — unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else\". The ability to ask questions is often assessed in relation to comprehension of syntactic structures. It is widely accepted, that the first questions are asked by humans during their early infancy, at the pre-syntactic, one word stage of language development, with the use of question intonation.\n\n"}

He is mostly known for his 1956 publication \"Oracles and Demons of Tibet\", which was the first detailed study of Tibetan deity cults.\n\nRené Mario de Nebesky-Wojkowitz was born in Groß Hoschütz in Moravia on 29 June 1923. After completing his secondary education in Leitmeritz and Prague, he devoted himself to the study of Central Asian ethnology, Tibetan, and Mongolian at the universities of Berlin and Vienna. It was especially the teachings of the late Robert Bleichsteiner at the University of Vienna that encouraged him to specialize in Tibetan studies. Before the defense of his doctoral thesis (see Bibliography, no. 3) on November 3, 1949 he published two articles on the Bön religion and the state oracle. From November 1949 to July 1950 he continued his studies in Italy under the direction of Giuseppe Tucci and Joseph Rock, as well as in London at the School of Oriental and African Studies and the London School of Economics.\n\nIn August 1950, Nebesky-Wojkowitz set off for Kalimpong and did not return to Europe until February 1953 (nos. 16, 18). His long stay there gave him access to many texts on protector deities and allowed him to benefit from the council of Tibetan scholars who sought refuge during the Chinese incursion. One can find a vivid description of events at that time in a book he intended for non-specialists (no. 20). Nebesky-Wojkowitz published the results of his research in several articles, and especially in his most important work, \"Oracles and Demons of Tibet: The Cult and Iconography of the Tibetan Protective Deities\" (no. 22). This voluminous 666-page book is widely considered a foundational study of Tibetan popular religion and deity cults, making it an indispensable compendium for all those who deal with protector deities. Nebesky-Wojkowitz also made several excursions among the Lepcha of Sikkim (nos. 7, 10, 14, 15). In 1954 he spent five months in Leiden identifying the collection of Lepcha manuscripts at the National Museum of Ethnology, where he had already made a list of the titles of Tibetan xylographs and manuscripts during a seven-month stay in 1953.\n\nRené de Nebesky-Wojkowitz visited Kalimpong and Sikkim a second time in the last months of 1956 before going to Nepal to look for a new site of exploration (no. 23). In 1958-1959 he visited Nepal again and stayed there for three months. He collected a considerable amount of material as well as 400 objects for the Museum of Ethnology in Vienna, where they remain today. In 1958 he became a \"wissenschaftlicher Beamter\" at the Museum of Ethnology. At the start of 1958 he was diagnosed with pneumonia, the effects of which were felt during his third expedition to the Himalayas in 1958-1959. The travels that he undertook in Nepal became too demanding on his health and, upon his return to Vienna, he died at the age of 36 on July 9, 1959 after a brief illness.\n\nAccording to de Jong, René de Nebesky-Wojkowitz died of pneumonia. However, his cause of death has been almost completely eclipsed by how tragically young he was when he succumbed. Because of this, an urban legend of sorts has come to surround Nebesky-Wojkowitz's death, with many members of the Tibetan Buddhist community believing that his death was actually brought on by the wrath of the very protector deities he studied so assiduously. In his critique of Tibetan shamanism, scholar Zeff Bjerken describes his own personal experience with this widespread belief:\n\nAmong scholars of Tibetan religions, as well as outside observers, opinions vary, with some taking this belief seriously and others not. Two decades prior to Bjerken’s account, John Blofeld, a popular British writer on Eastern religions, made the following morbidly droll statement: “Tibetans were not surprised when the distinguished author of \"Oracles and Demons of Tibet\" came to an untimely end soon after completing that monumental but dullish book. The subject of Guardians is one on which nothing detailed should be said; to write at length about demons is always held to be unwise; but his ultimate crime was to make them seem \"boring\"!” This latter contention is, at times, still spoken of in jest among Tibetan specialists today.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13673316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13673316", "title": "San Andrés (Mesoamerican site)", "text": "San Andrés (Mesoamerican site)\n\nSan Andrés is an Olmec archaeological site in the present-day Mexican state of Tabasco. Located 5 km (3 miles) northeast of the Olmec ceremonial center of La Venta in the Grijalva river delta section of the Tabasco Coastal Plain, San Andrés is considered one of its elite satellite communities, with evidence of elite residences and other elite activities. Several important archaeological finds have been made at San Andrés, including the oldest evidence of the domesticated sunflower, insight into Olmec feasting rituals, didactic miniatures, and possible evidence of an Olmec writing system.\n\nMary Pohl, funded by The Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, Inc. (FAMSI), has been a crucial part of conducting ceramic analysis and collecting evidence of feasting vessels and early Olmec writing on greenstone plaques and ceramic roller stamps.\n\nThe earliest evidence of human activity at San Andrés – maize (\"Zea\" species) pollen and extensive charcoal deposits from swidden (slash-and-burn) agriculture – has been dated to 5300 BCE. At that time, the Gulf of Mexico was further inland and San Andrés was the site of beach ridges and barrier lagoons, features that are today some 15 km to the north.\n\nLater evidence of human habitation includes pollen dated to 4600 BCE, seeds from 2600 BCE, and evidence of maize cultivation from 2000 BCE.\n\nThe first evidence of Olmec occupation has been dated to 1350 BCE, an occupation that lasted some 150 years (until 1200 BCE), with an ensuing hiatus lasting until roughly 900 BCE. Continuously occupied over the following 550 years, San Andrés was finally abandoned some time before 350 BCE. This date roughly coincides with the abandonment of the La Venta and the dissolution of the Olmec culture.\n\nSan Andrés is notable for the ancient pollen and seeds recovered there. Although the humid rainy tropical lowlands have made quick work of organic substances, including Olmec skeletal remains, the multi-disciplinary research team delved below the water table, hoping that the preservative nature of water-logged soil would enable them to retrieve ancient samples.\n\nTheir findings include:\n\n“In Formative period Mesoamerica, high-status goods were significant components of cultural practice and a source of social, political, and ideological power.” Seinfeld (2007) asserts that “early complex societies often used feasting as a way for individuals to gain followers and to assert their status” and that this occurred at San Andres. This study is particularly interesting because the researchers used sound and updated methods to determine social facts concerning feasting at a site where little is conclusively known about social structures. Maize and cacao were detected due to their distinctive biomarkers including C4 signature plant carbon for maize and nitrogen containing organic compounds for cacao. “Discoveries include patterns of maize use suggestive of its use as an elite feasting food and beverage rather than as a dietary staple. Further results suggest possible evidence of Olmec cacao use.” During the Middle Formative period feasting allowed the elite to demonstrate their power and enhance their status and identity, as the consumption of alcohol had ritualistic and spiritual meaning among the elites. Cocoa, maize-alcohol, and “elite-foods” gave these gatherings special significance and provides definite proof that there was an elite class in San Andres, and, by extension, La Venta.\n\nPohl (2005) and her colleagues found plenty of evidence to suggest that miniature representations of everyday objects were used ritualistically. “These miniatures may have been crafted with the express purpose of composing didactic or ritual reenactments of crucial mythic or conventionalized historic events much in the same fashion as La Venta Offering 4.” Other elite-religious-status denoting objects (greenstone artifacts, jewelry, maskettes, iron-ore mirrors, etc.) were found at San Andres. “A contextual comparison suggests that, like the La Venta prestige artifacts, the San Andrés sumptuary items were significant components of ceremonial activity.” \n\n Excavations at San Andrés in 1997 and 1998 produced three artifacts that many archaeologists contend demonstrate that the Olmec civilization used a true writing system. These artifacts, dated roughly to 650 BCE (the middle of the Olmec concentration at La Venta and San Andres), were found in a refuse dump, the remains from a festival or feast. “The fact that the artifacts with glyphs were found in the context of feasting refuse suggest that writing among the Olmec was sacred and was closely tied to ritual activities.” \n\nThe most important find was a fist-sized ceramic cylinder seal, likely used to print cloth. When rolled out, the seal shows two speech scrolls emanating from a bird, followed directly by a number of design elements enframing what has been interpreted as logograms for “king (sideways U shape),” \"3 (three dots, according to the Mesoamerican bar and dots numbering system),” and “Ajaw (from the sacred 260-day calendar)\", a designation used for both a calendar date and, in keeping with Mesoamerican custom, the name of an Olmec ruler.\nIn addition to the ceramic cylinder seal, two fingernail-sized fragments from a greenstone plaque have been recovered, each containing an incised glyph. Both these glyphs have been linked to well-documented glyphs in other Mesoamerican writing systems, including the Isthmian and Maya scripts.\n\nWell-known archaeologist and writer Michael D. Coe interprets these glyphs as \"an early kind of writing\" while Richard A. Diehl, who excavated at the Olmec site of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan with Coe, finds that this discovery \"establishes the existence of Olmec writing and calendrics by 650 B.C.E\" On the other hand, Mayanist epigrapher David Stuart stated that it would be hard to discern evidence of a writing system in a handful of symbols.\n\nThe question of whether the Olmecs possessed a writing system was complicated in 2006 by the discovery of the Cascajal Block. This artifact, a slab of serpentine with 62 incised characters, has been dated to 900 BCE, although it was discovered without archaeological context. Instead of being precursors to the San Andrés glyphs, however, the 28 unique Cascajal block characters bear no obvious resemblance to them and are, indeed, unlike those of any other Mesoamerican writing system. Questions concerning the interpretation of the San Andrés glyphs (and the Cascajal block) will need to await further research.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "9528038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9528038", "title": "Swifterbant culture", "text": "Swifterbant culture\n\nThe Swifterbant culture was a Subneolithic archaeological culture in the Netherlands, dated between 5300 BC and 3400 BC. Like the Ertebølle culture, the settlements were concentrated near water, in this case creeks, riverdunes and bogs along post-glacial banks of rivers like the Overijsselse Vecht.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, artifacts classified as \"Swifterbant culture\" were found in the (now dry) Noordoostpolder in the Netherlands, near the village of Swifterbant and the former island of Urk. Other well-known sites were uncovered in Zuid Holland (Bergschenhoek) and the Betuwe (Hardinxveld-Giessendam).\n\nThe oldest finds related to this culture, dated to circa 5600 BC, cannot be distinguished from the Ertebølle culture, normally associated with Northern Germany and Southern Scandinavia. The culture is ancestral to the Western group of the agricultural Funnelbeaker culture (4000–2700 BC), which extended through Northern Netherlands and Northern Germany to the Elbe. \n\nThe earliest dated sites are season settlements. A transition from hunter-gatherer culture to cattle farming, primarily cows and pigs, occurred around 4800–4500 BC. Pottery has been attested from this period. In the region indications to the existence of pottery are present from before the arrival of the Linear Pottery culture in the neighbourhood. \nThe material culture reflects a local evolution from Mesolithic communities, with a pottery in a Nordic (Ertebølle) style and trade relationships with southern late Rössen culture communities, as testified by the presence of true Breitkeile pottery sherds.\n\nThe Rössen culture, being an offshoot of Linear Pottery, is older than the finds in Swifterbant, and contemporary to older stages of this culture as found in Hoge Vaart (Almere) and Hardinxveld. Contact between Swifterbant and Rössen expressed itself by some hybrid early Swifterbant pots in Anvers (Doel) and hybrid Rössen pottery Hamburg-Boberg. In general, Swifterbant pottery does not show the same variety as Rössen pottery and Swifterbant pottery with Rössen influences are rare. Possibly the idea of cooking could be derived from agricultural neighbours. However, the technical style for making pottery are too different to consider such external influences. \n\nWetland settlement, unlike previous opinions, was a deliberate choice by prehistoric communities, as this offered attractive ecological conditions and a high natural productivity or agricultural potential.\nThe economy covered a broad spectrum of resources to gather food, ruled by a strategy to diversify rather than increasing volume. As such, the wetlands offered, next to hunting and fishing, optimized conditions for cattle and small scale cultivation of different crops, each having conditions for growing of their own. The agrarian transformation of the prehistoric community was an exclusively indigenous process, that ultimately realized itself only at the end of the Neolithic. This view has been supported by the discovery of an agricultural field in Swifterbant dated 4300–4000 BC.\n\nAnimal sacrifices found in the bogs of Drenthe are attributed to Swifterbant and suggest a religious role for both wild and domesticated bovines.\n\n"}

It shows French Emperor Napoleon I in uniform in his study at the Tuileries Palace. Despite the detail, it is unlikely that Napoleon posed for the portrait.\n\nIt was a private commission from the Scottish nobleman and admirer of Napoleon, Alexander Hamilton, 10th Duke of Hamilton in 1811 and completed in 1812. Originally shown at Hamilton Palace, it was sold to Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery in 1882, from whom it was bought by the Samuel H.

This maintains his new civil rather than heroic (as in Canova's \"Napoleon as Mars the Peacemaker\") or military (as in David's own \"Napoleon Crossing the Alps\") image, though the sword on the chair's armrest still refers back to his military successes. The fleurs-de-lys and heraldic bees also imply the stability of the imperial dynasty.\n\nA second version painted by David, showing exactly the same scene but with Napoleon in his more everyday green mounted chasseurs uniform, was formerly in Prince Napoleon's collection and has since 1979 been in that of the Château de Versailles.\n\nAn analysis of the original painting reveals that the artist reedited the composition and details several times to balance the image, add allusions, and capture a complete story.\n\nBrush strokes and texture indicate that an earlier version had\nNapoleon's upper body flanked by two fluted columns about the width\nof the figure's torso. These strong vertical elements would have created a\ndistraction from the central figure.\n\nThese columns were revised to a carved panel in shadow (on the viewer's\nleft) and a clock with a large face (viewer's right) on level with and\nsomewhat larger than the figure's face. The clock was later repainted\nwith a smaller face moved up and to the right, with the clock body still\ncovering the underlying column brush strokes.\n\nThese revisions greatly improved the compositional balance of the\npainting's upper section, reducing the impression of three vertical\ncolumns. They successfully moved the viewer's focus to Napoleon's face and\nexpression and away from the presumably accurate stature and\nmiddle-heavy build.\n\nThe change also allowed incorporating additional symbology, most notably\nthe time (4:13).\n\nOther revisions were added symbols on the table items and lower section,\nmany painted over fleurs-de-lis which are conspicuously rare in the final image.\n\n\n"}

Noe (born July 1954) is an Ohio Republican party fundraiser and activist, guilty of money laundering for the 2004 Bush-Cheney campaign and of theft and corruption in the \"Coingate scandal\". A longtime resident of Toledo, Ohio, Noeand his wife held several party positions and minor offices within the government of Ohio. He was also a prominent Republican fundraiser and served as chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio and chairman of the Lucas County Republican party. Noe was also an avid coin dealer and owned various coin dealing companies, such as \"Capital Coin\" and \"Vintage Coins & Collectibles\", as well as their subsidiaries.\n\nBoth Noe and his wife Bernadette Restivo-Noe have been chairperson of the Lucas County Republican party. Noe was also chairman of the 2004 Bush-Cheney election campaign in Northwest Ohio. Noe was convicted of making illegal contributions to George W. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign.\n\nDuring the 2004 election, Noe's wife Bernadette was chairman of the Lucas County Board of Elections. In the 2004 election, the county experienced extreme voting difficulties, including criminal investigations and manipulation of the recount, and many officials resigned or were suspended. The Ohio Secretary of State told Bernadette to resign or be fired. She resigned from both the Lucas County Republican Party and the Lucas County Board of Elections in December 2004.\n\nNoe was appointed to the Ohio Board of Regents, which oversees Ohio's public colleges and universities, by former Ohio Governor George Voinovich in 1995 to complete a vacated term. Noe was reinstated for a full 9-year term in 1999 by Governor Bob Taft.\n\nIn late 2004, Noe wrote to the Ohio Ethics Commission to seek an opinion on his involvement with \"Hi-Genomics LLC\" which licenses a patent on plant genetic engineering from the University of Toledo. Noe was vice-president of \"Hi-Genomics LLC\" and owned a 23% stake in the company. Noe's position on the Board of Regents was deemed to be a conflict of interest by the Ohio Ethics Commission. Noe was told to either resign from the Board, divest his interest in the company, or step down as vice-president of the company. Noe eventually sold back his units in Hi-Genomics to one of the other unitholders.\n\nIn 2003 Governor Taft appointed Noe chairman of the Ohio Turnpike Commission for an 8-year term. On May 10, 2005, Noe resigned from the Turnpike Commission.\n\nApart from being President of his company, Thomas Noe Inc. (Noe owns 60%), Noe owns and/or manages many different companies that deal rare coins. His store, Vintage Coins & Collectibles (or Vintage Coins & Cards), is the parent company. Noe was also a statutory agent for the Professional Numismatists Guild, a nonprofit organization of top numismatists whose members follow a strict code of ethics, for more than 25 years. He resigned in May 2005.\n\nNoe served as chairman of the Ohio Commemorative Quarter Program Committee during its operation in the 2000s. Noe was appointed chairman of the U.S. Mint's Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC) by U.S. Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snow in October 2004. The CCAC advises the secretary on issues relating to commemorative coin design and circulation. He was recommended by U.S. House Representative Dennis Hastert. He resigned in May 2005.\n\nNoe has been convicted in two separate, but overlapping investigations for a variety of corrupt activities in Ohio and in national politics.\n\nOn October 27, 2005, Noe was indicted in a federal investigation on counts of conspiracy, conduit contribution violations, and false statements.\n\nNoe was accused of illegally funneling $45,400 to President Bush's re-election campaign, using \"two dozen people as \"conduits\" to make illegal campaign contributions at a $2,000-a-seat fund-raiser in Columbus. Conduits named in a federal affidavit include Lucas County Commissioner Maggie Thurber, Toledo City Councilwoman Betty Shultz, former Toledo Mayor Donna Owens and former State Representative Sally Perz. In doing so, Noe skirted federal campaign finance funding limits while meeting a pledge to raise $50,000 for the October 30, 2003, fund-raiser. The Bush campaign later named Noe a \"Pioneer\" for raising at least $100,000 overall ... In addition to \"conduits\" who received between $1,750 and $4,000 from Noe to make either one or two contributions, prosecutors claim that the former rare-coin dealer used two people as \"super-conduits,\" giving them $6,000 and $14,300 that they then split with others who attended the fund-raiser.\" Noe is now is serving a jail term of at least 10 years.\n\nOn October 31, 2005, Noe pled not-guilty to all three charges. On May 31, 2006, Noe reversed his earlier plea and pled guilty.\n\nOn September 12, 2006, Noe was sentenced to 27 months in a federal prison for funneling money into the re-election campaign of President Bush illegally.\n\nNoe is also at the center of the Ohio Coingate scandal. On November 13, 2006, Noe was found guilty of theft, money laundering, forgery and corrupt activity, and the central charge: that he engaged in a pattern of corruption in his management of Ohio's $50 million rare-coin fund investment with the bureau.\n\nOn February 13, 2006, the Lucas County District Court of Ohio indicted Noe , along with his business partner, Timothy LaPointe.\n\nThe prosecution presented their case in three weeks that Noe stole $2 million for personal use; the defense argued that Noe's government contract allowed him the freedom to use the state's money however he wanted, but called no witnesses. The jury deliberated for three days before delivering their verdict. On November 20, 2006, Thomas Noe was given an 18-year sentence, to be served after the 27-month federal sentence imposed in September, fined $213,000, \"ordered to pay the cost of the prosecution, estimated at nearly $3 million, and ordered to pay restitution to the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation for the money missing from the rare-coin fund, estimated at $13.7 million.\"\n\nEarlier, on August 17, 2005, Ohio Governor Bob Taft was charged with four criminal misdemeanors stemming from his failure to disclose golf outings paid for by lobbyists, as well as some undisclosed gifts. The gifts were varied, but included gifts from Noe. It was the first time an Ohio governor was ever been charged with a crime while in office.\n\n\n"}

Given the nature of Usenet forums, parodic translation is prevalent in flame wars, where remarks such as \"Translation: 'I do not have a clue and am throwing mud'\" are used to imply — on very little ground — that another poster is not making any appreciable contribution to the subject.\n\nUnlike other forms of parody, translation has a relatively recent history; early usages of the device can be seen in the work of the Viennese literary critic and journalist Karl Kraus, who claimed to translate from other journalists' — famously former friend Harden — and from \"Moskauderwelch\" — a derisive term for the highly elaborate Marxist jargon of the time, a pun on \"Moskau\", Moscow, and \"Kauderwelch\", gibberish. Kraus' influence is notable in Karl Popper; while translation of scientific theories into verificationist terms had been a standard procedure in logical positivism for some time, Popper's criticism of several philosophers and scientists that failed to comply with his notion of the scientific method took a mocking quality reminiscent of the former.\n"}

{"id": "11830447", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11830447", "title": "Whispering", "text": "Whispering\n\nWhispering is an unvoiced mode of phonation in which the vocal folds (vocal cords) are abducted so that they do not vibrate; air passes between the arytenoid cartilages to create audible turbulence during speech. Supralaryngeal articulation remains the same as in normal speech.\n\nIn normal speech, the vocal folds alternate between states of voice and voicelessness. In whispering, only the voicing segments change, so that the vocal folds alternate between whisper and voicelessness (though the acoustic difference between the two states is minimal). Because of this, implementing speech recognition for whispered speech is more difficult, as the characteristic spectral range needed to detect syllables and words is not given through the total absence of tone. More advanced techniques such as neural networks may be used, however, as is done by Amazon Alexa.\n\nThere is no symbol in the IPA for whispered phonation, since it is not used phonemically in any language. However, a sub-dot under phonemically voiced segments is sometimes seen in the literature, as for whispered \"should.\"\n\nWhispering is generally used quietly, to limit the hearing of speech to listeners who are nearby; for example, to convey secret information without being overheard or to avoid disturbing others in a quiet place such as a library or place of worship. Whispering is also used to speak to someone quietly in a school especially when a teaching assistant or a support worker in an alternative room is reading questions to someone during an exam. Loud whispering, known as a stage whisper, is generally used only for dramatic or emphatic purposes. Whispering also takes less effort to vocalize than a normal speech pattern. This is because less air needs to be used to vocalize the sound. However, while it takes less effort to produce a whisper, it tires out the vocal folds more quickly.\n\nA number of species of animals have been observed to whisper, including the cotton-top tamarin and the barbastelle bat. The reasons for animal whispering vary, and are not fully understood, but whispering among the tamarins appears to serve a social purpose, while the species of bats appears to whisper in order to evade detection by its particular prey, eared moths.\n\n\n"}
