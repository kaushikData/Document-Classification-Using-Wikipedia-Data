The 5th century is noted for being a period of migration and political instability, throughout Eurasia.\n\nIt saw the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, which came to an end in 476 AD. The Western Roman Empire was ruled by a succession of weak emperors, and true power began to fall increasingly into the hands of powerful generals. Internal instability and the pressing military problem of foreign invaders resulted in the ransacking of Rome by a Visigoth army in 410. Some recovery took place during the following decades, but the Western Empire received another serious blow when a second barbarian group, the Vandals, occupied Carthage, capital of the extremely important province of Africa. Attempts to retake the province were interrupted by the invasion of the Huns under Attila. After Attila's defeat, both Eastern and Western empires joined forces for a final assault on Vandal North Africa, but this campaign was a spectacular failure. \n\nIn East Asia, many nomadic tribes migrated into north-east and central China, where they established a series of dynasties. This launched a period of division and conflict between North China and South China.\n\nTowards the end of the 5th century, the Gupta Empire of India was invaded from Central Asia and occupied by elements of the Huna peoples – who may have been related to the Huns who had attacked the Romans (see above).\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book's origins lay in a talk Postman gave to the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1984. He was participating in a panel on George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" and the contemporary world. In the introduction to his book, Postman said that the contemporary world was better reflected by Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\", whose public was oppressed by their addiction to amusement, than by Orwell's work, where they were oppressed by state control.\n\nIt has been translated into eight languages and sold some 200,000 copies worldwide. In 2005, Postman's son Andrew reissued the book in a 20th anniversary edition.\n\nPostman distinguishes the Orwellian vision of the future, in which totalitarian governments seize individual rights, from that offered by Aldous Huxley in \"Brave New World,\" where people medicate themselves into bliss, thereby voluntarily sacrificing their rights. Drawing an analogy with the latter scenario, Postman sees television's entertainment value as a present-day \"soma\", the fictitious pleasure drug in Brave New World, by means of which the citizens' rights are exchanged for consumers' entertainment.\n\nThe essential premise of the book, which Postman extends to the rest of his argument(s), is that \"form excludes the content\" that is, a particular medium can only sustain a particular level of ideas. Thus rational argument, integral to print typography, is militated against by the medium of television for this reason. Owing to this shortcoming, politics and religion are diluted, and \"news of the day\" becomes a packaged commodity. Television de-emphasises the quality of information in favour of satisfying the far-reaching needs of entertainment, by which information is encumbered and to which it is subordinate.\n\nPostman asserts the presentation of television news is a form of entertainment programming; arguing that the inclusion of theme music, the interruption of commercials, and \"talking hairdos\" bear witness that televised news cannot readily be taken seriously. Postman further examines the differences between written speech, which he argues reached its prime in the early to mid-nineteenth century, and the forms of televisual communication, which rely mostly on visual images to \"sell\" lifestyles. He argues that, owing to this change in public discourse, politics has ceased to be about a candidate's ideas and solutions, but whether he comes across favorably on television. Television, he notes, has introduced the phrase \"now this\", which implies a \"complete absence\" of connection between the separate topics the phrase ostensibly connects. Larry Gonick used this phrase to conclude his \"Cartoon Guide to (Non)Communication,\" instead of the traditional \"the end\".\n\nPostman refers to the inability to act upon much of the so-called information from televised sources as the Information-action ratio. He contends that \"television is altering the meaning of 'being informed' by creating a species of information that might properly be called disinformation—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing\".\n\nDrawing on the ideas of media scholar Marshall McLuhan — altering McLuhan's aphorism \"the medium is the message\", to \"the medium is the metaphor\" — he describes how oral, literate, and televisual cultures radically differ in the processing and prioritization of information; he argues that each medium is appropriate for a different kind of knowledge. The faculties requisite for rational inquiry are simply weakened by televised viewing. Accordingly, reading, a prime example cited by Postman, exacts intense intellectual involvement, at once interactive and dialectical; whereas television only requires passive involvement.\n\nPostman argues that commercial television has become derivative of advertising. Moreover, modern television commercials are not \"a series of testable, logically ordered assertions\" rationalizing consumer decisions, but \"is a drama—a mythology, if you will—of handsome people\" being driven to \"near ecstasy by their good fortune\" of possessing advertised goods or services. \"The truth or falsity of an advertiser's claim is simply not an issue\" because more often than not \"no claims are made, except those the viewer projects onto or infers from the drama.\" Because commercial television is programmed according to ratings, its content is determined by commercial feasibility, not critical acumen. Television in its present state, he says, does not satisfy the conditions for honest intellectual involvement and rational argument.\n\nHe repeatedly states that the eighteenth century, the \"Age of Reason\", was the pinnacle for rational argument. Only in the printed word, he states, could complicated truths be rationally conveyed. Postman gives a striking example: many of the first fifteen U.S. presidents could probably have walked down the street without being recognized by the average citizen, yet all these men would have been quickly known by their written words. However, the reverse is true today. The names of presidents or even famous preachers, lawyers, and scientists call up visual images, typically television images, but few, if any, of their words come to mind. The few that do almost exclusively consist of carefully chosen soundbites. Postman mentions Ronald Reagan, and comments upon Reagan's abilities as an entertainer.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "191703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191703", "title": "Anthropocentrism", "text": "Anthropocentrism\n\nAnthropocentrism (; from Greek , \"ánthrōpos\", \"human being\"; and , \"kéntron\", \"center\") is the belief that human beings are the most important entity in the universe. Anthropocentrism interprets or regards the world in terms of human values and experiences. The term can be used interchangeably with humanocentrism, and some refer to the concept as human supremacy or human exceptionalism. Anthropocentrism is considered to be profoundly embedded in many modern human cultures and conscious acts. It is a major concept in the field of environmental ethics and environmental philosophy, where it is often considered to be the root cause of problems created by human action within the ecosphere.\n\nHowever, many proponents of anthropocentrism state that this is not necessarily the case: they argue that a sound long-term view acknowledges that a healthy, sustainable environment is necessary for humans and that the real issue is shallow anthropocentrism.\n\nAnthropocentrism, also known as homocentricism or human supremacism, has been posited by some environmentalists, in such books as \"Confessions of an Eco-Warrior\" by Dave Foreman and \"Green Rage\" by Christopher Manes, as the underlying (if unstated) reason why humanity dominates and sees the need to \"develop\" most of the Earth. Anthropocentrism is believed by some to be the central problematic concept in environmental philosophy, where it is used to draw attention claims of a systematic bias in traditional Western attitudes to the non-human world. Val Plumwood has argued that anthropocentrism plays an analogous role in green theory to androcentrism in feminist theory and ethnocentrism in anti-racist theory. Plumwood calls human-centredness \"anthrocentrism\" to emphasise this parallel.\n\nOne of the first extended philosophical essays addressing environmental ethics, John Passmore's \"Man's Responsibility for Nature\" has been criticised by defenders of deep ecology because of its anthropocentrism, often claimed to be constitutive of traditional Western moral thought. Indeed, defenders of anthropocentrism concerned with the ecological crisis contend that the maintenance of a healthy, sustainable environment is necessary for human well-being as opposed to for its own sake. The problem with a \"shallow\" viewpoint is not that it is human-centred but that according to William Grey: \"What's wrong with shallow views is not their concern about the well-being of humans, but that they do not really consider enough in what that well-being consists. According to this view, we need to develop an enriched, fortified anthropocentric notion of human interest to replace the dominant short-term, sectional and self-regarding conception.\" In turn, Plumwood in \"Environmental Culture: The Ecological Crisis of Reason\" argued that Grey's anthropocentrism is inadequate.\n\nIt is important to take note that many devoted environmentalists encompass a somewhat anthropocentric-based philosophical view supporting the fact that they will argue in favor of saving the environment for the sake of human populations. Grey writes: \"We should be concerned to promote a rich, diverse, and vibrant biosphere. Human flourishing may certainly be included as a legitimate part of such a flourishing.\" Such a concern for human flourishing amidst the flourishing of life as a whole, however, is said to be indistinguishible from that of deep ecology and biocentrism, which has been proposed as both an antithesis of anthropocentrism. and as a generalised form of anthropocentrism.\n\nMaimonides, a scholar of the Torah who lived in the 12th century AD, was noted for being decidedly anti-anthropocentric. Maimonides called man \"a mere 'drop of the bucket’\" and \"not 'the axle of the world'\". He also claimed that anthropocentric thinking is what causes humans to think that evil things exist in nature. According to Rabbi Norman Lamm, Maimonides \"thus deflate[d] man's extravagant notions of his own importance and urge[d] us to abandon these illusions.\"\n\nIn the 1985 CBC series \"A Planet For the Taking\", Dr. David Suzuki explored the Old Testament roots of anthropocentrism and how it shaped our view of non-human animals. Some Christian proponents of anthropocentrism base their belief on the Bible, such as the verse 1:26 in the Book of Genesis:\nThe use of the word \"dominion\" in the \"Genesis\" is controversial. Many Biblical scholars, especially Roman Catholic and other non-Protestant Christians, consider this to be a flawed translation of a word meaning \"stewardship\", which would indicate that mankind should take care of the earth and its various forms of life.\n\nAnthropocentrism is the grounding for some naturalistic concepts of human rights. Defenders of anthropocentrism argue that it is the necessary fundamental premise to defend universal human rights, since what matters morally is simply being human. For example, noted philosopher Mortimer J. Adler wrote, \"Those who oppose injurious discrimination on the moral ground that all human beings, being equal in their humanity, should be treated equally in all those respects that concern their common humanity, would have no solid basis in fact to support their normative principle.\" Adler is stating here, that denying what is now called human exceptionalism could lead to tyranny, writing that if we ever came to believe that humans do not possess a unique moral status, the intellectual foundation of our liberties collapses: \"Why, then, should not groups of superior men be able to justify their enslavement, exploitation, or even genocide of inferior human groups on factual and moral grounds akin to those we now rely on to justify our treatment of the animals we harness as beasts of burden, that we butcher for food and clothing, or that we destroy as disease-bearing pests or as dangerous predators?\"\n\nAuthor and anthropocentrism defender Wesley J. Smith from the Discovery Institute has written that human exceptionalism is what gives rise to human duties to each other, the natural world, and to treat animals humanely. Writing in \"A Rat is a Pig is a Dog is a Boy\", a critique of animal rights ideology, \"Because we \"are\" unquestionably a unique species—the only species capable of even contemplating ethical issues and assuming responsibilities—we uniquely are capable of apprehending the difference between right and wrong, good and evil, proper and improper conduct toward animals. Or to put it more succinctly if being human isn't what requires us to treat animals humanely, what in the world does?\"\n\nIn cognitive psychology, anthropocentric thinking can be defined as \"the tendency to reason about unfamiliar biological species or processes by analogy to humans\". Reasoning by analogy is an attractive thinking strategy, and it can be tempting to apply our own experience of being human to other biological systems. For example, because death is commonly felt to be undesirable, it may be tempting to form the misconception that death at a cellular level or elsewhere in nature is similarly undesirable (whereas in reality programmed cell death is an essential physiological phenomenon, and ecosystems also rely on death). Conversely, anthropocentric thinking can also lead people to underattribute human characteristics to other organisms. For instance, it may be tempting to wrongly assume that an animal that is very different from humans, such as an insect, will not share particular biological characteristics, such as reproduction or blood circulation.\n\nAnthropocentric thinking has predominantly been studied in young children (mostly up to the age of 10) by developmental psychologists interested in its relevance to biology education. Although relatively little is known about its persistence at a later age, evidence exists that this pattern of human exceptionalist thinking can continue through young adulthood, even among students who have been increasingly educated in biology.\n\nThe notion that anthropocentric thinking is an innate human characteristic has been challenged by study of American children raised in urban environments, among whom it appears to emerge between the ages of 3 and 5 years as an acquired perspective. Children's recourse to anthropocentric thinking seems to vary with experience and cultural assumptions about the place of humans in the natural world. Children raised in rural environments appear to use it less than their urban counterparts because of their greater familiarity with different species of animals and plants. Studies involving children from some of the indigenous peoples of the Americas have found little use of anthropocentric thinking. Study of children among the Wichí people in South America showed a tendency to think of living organisms in terms of their taxonomic or perceived similarities, ecological considerations, and animistic traditions, resulting in a much less anthropocentric view of the natural world than is experienced by many children in Western societies.\n\nIn fiction from all eras and societies, there is fiction treating as normal the actions of humans to ride, eat, milk, and otherwise treat animals as separate species. There are occasional exceptions, such as talking animals, but they are generally treated as exceptions, as aberrations to the rule distinguishing people from animals.\n\nIn science fiction, \"humanocentrism\" is the idea that humans, as both beings and as a species, are the superior sentients. Essentially the equivalent of racial supremacy on a galactic scale, it entails intolerant discrimination against sentient non-humans, much like race supremacists discriminate against those not of their race. A prime example of this concept is utilized as a story element for the \"Mass Effect\" series. After humanity's first contact results in a brief war, many humans in the series develop suspicious or even hostile attitudes towards the game's various alien races. By the time of the first game, which takes place several decades after the war, many humans still retain such sentiments in addition to forming 'pro-human' organizations.\n\nThis idea is countered by anti-humanism. At times, this ideal also includes fear of and superiority over strong AIs and cyborgs, downplaying the ideas of integration, cybernetic revolts, machine rule and Tilden's Laws of Robotics.\n\nMark Twain mocked the belief in human supremacy in \"Letters from the Earth\" (written c. 1909, published 1962).\n\nThe 2012 documentary \"The Superior Human?\" systematically analyzes anthropocentrism and concludes that value is fundamentally an opinion, and since life forms naturally value their own traits, most humans are misled to believe that they are actually more valuable than other species. This natural bias, according to the film, combined with a received sense of comfort and an excuse for exploitation of non-humans cause anthropocentrism to remain in society.\n\n"}

The message was broadcast into space a single time via frequency modulated radio waves at a ceremony to mark the remodeling of the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico on 16 November 1974. The message was aimed at the current location of M13 some 25,000 light years away because M13 was a large and close collection of stars that was available in the sky at the time and place of the ceremony. The message consisted of 1,679 binary digits, approximately 210 bytes, transmitted at a frequency of 2,380 MHz and modulated by shifting the frequency by 10 Hz, with a power of 450 kW. The \"ones\" and \"zeros\" were transmitted by frequency shifting at the rate of 10 bits per second.

In fact, the core of M13, to which the message was aimed, will no longer be in that location when the message arrives. However, as the proper motion of M13 is small, the message will still arrive near the center of the cluster. According to the \"Cornell News\" press release of November 12, 1999, the real purpose of the message was not to make contact but to demonstrate the capabilities of newly installed equipment.\n\nOn 16 November 2018, Google released a Doodle to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the transmission.\n\n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nThe numbers from 1 to 10 appear in binary format (the bottom row marks the beginning of each number).\n\nEven assuming that recipients would recognize binary, the encoding of the numbers may not be immediately obvious because of the way they have been written.

The readings for 8, 9 and 10 are a little different, as they have been given an additional column next to the first (to the right in the image).

{"id": "33463304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33463304", "title": "Birth control in the United States", "text": "Birth control in the United States\n\nBirth control in the United States is a complicated issue with a long history.\n\nThe practice of birth control was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914, when the movement to legalize contraception began. Longstanding techniques included the rhythm method, withdrawal, diaphragms, contraceptive sponges, condoms, prolonged breastfeeding, and spermicides. Use of contraceptives increased throughout the nineteenth century, contributing to a 50 percent drop in the fertility rate in the United States between 1800 and 1900, particularly in urban regions. The only known survey conducted during the nineteenth century of American women's contraceptive habits was performed by Clelia Mosher from 1892 to 1912. The survey was based on a small sample of upper-class women, and shows that most of the women used contraception (primarily douching, but also withdrawal, rhythm, condoms and pessaries) and that they viewed sex as a pleasurable act that could be undertaken without the goal of procreation.\n\nAlthough contraceptives were relatively common in middle-class and upper-class society, the topic was rarely discussed in public. The first book published in the United States which ventured to discuss contraception was \"Moral Physiology; or, A Brief and Plain Treatise on the Population Question\", published by Robert Dale Owen in 1831. The book suggested that family planning was a laudable effort, and that sexual gratification – without the goal of reproduction – was not immoral. Owen recommended withdrawal, but he also discussed sponges and condoms. That book was followed by \"Fruits of Philosophy: The Private Companion of Young Married People\", written in 1832 by Charles Knowlton, which recommended douching. Knowlton was prosecuted in Massachusetts on obscenity charges, and served three months in prison.\n\nBirth control practices were generally adopted earlier in Europe than in the United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, with the goal of challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the Malthusian League – the world's first birth control advocacy group – which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus' dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs. The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.\nContraception was not restricted by law in the United States throughout most of the 19th century, but in the 1870s a social purity movement grew in strength, aimed at outlawing vice in general, and prostitution and obscenity in particular. Composed primarily of Protestant moral reformers and middle-class women, the Victorian-era campaign also attacked contraception, which was viewed as an immoral practice that promoted prostitution and venereal disease. Anthony Comstock, a grocery clerk and leader in the purity movement, successfully lobbied for the passage of the 1873 Comstock Act, a federal law prohibiting mailing of \"any article or thing designed or intended for the prevention of conception or procuring of abortion\" as well as any form of contraceptive information. After passage of this first Comstock Act, he was appointed to the position of postal inspector Many states also passed similar state laws (collectively known as the \"Comstock laws\"), sometimes extending the federal law by additionally restricting contraceptives, including information about them and their distribution. Comstock was proud of the fact that he was personally responsible for thousands of arrests and the destruction of hundreds of tons of books and pamphlets.\n\nComstock and his allies also took aim at the libertarians and utopians who comprised the free love movement – an initiative to promote sexual freedom, equality for women, and abolition of marriage. The free love proponents were the only group to actively oppose the Comstock laws in the 19th century, setting the stage for the birth control movement.\n\nThe efforts of the free love movement were not successful and, at the beginning of the 20th century, federal and state governments began to enforce the Comstock laws more rigorously. In response, contraception went underground, but it was not extinguished. The number of publications on the topic dwindled, and advertisements, if they were found at all, used euphemisms such as \"marital aids\" or \"hygienic devices\". Drug stores continued to sell condoms as \"rubber goods\" and cervical caps as \"womb supporters\".\n\nAfter World War II, the birth control movement had accomplished the goal of making birth control legal, and advocacy for reproductive rights began to focus on abortion, public funding, and insurance coverage.\n\nBirth control advocacy organizations around the world also began to collaborate. In 1946, Sanger helped found the International Committee on Planned Parenthood, which evolved into the International Planned Parenthood Federation and soon became the world's largest non-governmental international family planning organization. In 1952, John D. Rockefeller III founded the influential Population Council. Fear of global overpopulation became a major issue in the 1960s, generating concerns about pollution, food shortages, and quality of life, leading to well-funded birth control campaigns around the world. The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women addressed birth control and influenced human rights declarations which asserted women's rights to control their own bodies.\n\nIn the early 1950s, philanthropist Katharine McCormick had provided funding for biologist Gregory Pincus to develop the birth control pill, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1960. The pill became very popular and had a major impact on society and culture. It contributed to a sharp increase in college attendance and graduation rates for women. New forms of intrauterine devices were introduced in the 1960s, increasing popularity of long acting reversible contraceptives.\n\nIn 1965, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" that it was unconstitutional for the government to prohibit married couples from using birth control.\n\nAlso in 1965, 26 states prohibited birth control for unmarried women. In 1967 Boston University students petitioned Bill Baird to challenge Massachusetts's stringent \"Crimes Against Chastity, Decency, Morality and Good Order\" law. On April 6, 1967 he gave a speech to 1,500 students and others at Boston University on abortion and birth control. He gave a female student one condom and a package of contraceptive foam. Baird was arrested and convicted as a felon, facing up to ten years in jail. He spent three months in Boston's Charles Street Jail. During his challenge to the Massachusetts law, the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts stated that \"there is nothing to be gained by court action of this kind. The only way to remove the limitations remaining in the law is through the legislative process.\" Despite this opposition, Baird fought for five years until \"Eisenstadt v. Baird\" legalized birth control for all Americans on March 22, 1972. \"Eisenstadt v. Baird\", a landmark right to privacy decision, became the foundation for such cases as \"Roe v. Wade\" and the 2003 gay rights victory \"Lawrence v. Texas\".\n\nIn 1970, Congress removed references to contraception from federal anti-obscenity laws; and in 1973, the \"Roe v. Wade\" decision legalized abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy.\nAlso in 1970, Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted as part of the war on poverty, to make family planning and preventive health services available to low-income and the uninsured. Without publicly funded family planning services, according to the Guttmacher Institute, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States would be nearly two-thirds higher; the number of unintended pregnancies among poor women would nearly double. According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, publicly funded family planning saves nearly $4 in Medicaid expenses for every $1 spent on services.\n\nIn 1982, European drug manufacturers developed mifepristone, which was initially utilized as a contraceptive, but is now generally prescribed with a prostoglandin to induce abortion in pregnancies up to the fourth month of gestation. To avoid consumer boycotts organized by anti-abortion organizations, the manufacturer donated the U.S. manufacturing rights to Danco Laboratories, a company formed by pro-choice advocates, with the sole purpose of distributing mifepristone in the U.S, and thus immune to the effects of boycotts.\n\nIn 1997, the FDA approved a prescription emergency contraception pill (known as the morning-after pill), which became available over the counter in 2006. In 2010, ulipristal acetate, an emergency contraceptive which is more effective after a longer delay was approved for use up to five days after unprotected sexual intercourse. Fifty to sixty percent of abortion patients became pregnant in circumstances in which emergency contraceptives could have been used. These emergency contraceptives, including Plan B and EllaOne, became another reproductive rights controversy. Opponents of emergency contraception consider it a form of abortion, because it may interfere with the ability of a fertilized embryo to implant in the uterus; while proponents contend that it is not abortion, because the absence of implantation means that pregnancy never commenced.\n\nIn 2000, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ruled that companies that provided insurance for prescription drugs to their employees but excluded birth control were violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nPresident Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) on 23 March 2010. As of 1 August 2011, female contraception was added to a list of preventive services covered by the ACA that would be provided without patient co-payment. The federal mandate applied to all new health insurance plans in all states from 1 August 2012. Grandfathered plans did not have to comply unless they changed substantially. To be grandfathered, a group plan must have existed or an individual plan must have been sold before President Obama signed the law; otherwise they were required to comply with the new law. The Guttmacher Institute noted that even before the federal mandate was implemented, twenty-eight states had their own mandates that required health insurance to cover the prescription contraceptives, but the federal mandate innovated by forbidding insurance companies from charging part of the cost to the patient.\n\n\"Burwell v. Hobby Lobby\", , is a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court allowing closely held for-profit corporations to be exempt from a law its owners religiously object to if there is a less restrictive means of furthering the law's interest. It is the first time that the court has recognized a for-profit corporation's claim of religious belief, but it is limited to \"closely held\" corporations. The decision is an interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and does not address whether such corporations are protected by the free-exercise of religion clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution. For such companies, the Court's majority directly struck down the contraceptive mandate under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by a 5–4 vote. The court said that the mandate was not the least restrictive way to ensure access to contraceptive care, noting that a less restrictive alternative was being provided for religious non-profits, until the Court issued an injunction 3 days later, effectively ending said alternative, replacing it with a government-sponsored alternative for any female employees of closely held corporations that do not wish to provide birth control.\n\n\"Zubik v. Burwell\" was a case before the United States Supreme Court on whether religious institutions other than churches should be exempt from the contraceptive mandate. Churches were already exempt. On May 16, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a per curiam ruling in \"Zubik v. Burwell\" that vacated the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals and remanded the case \"to the respective United States Courts of Appeals for the Third, Fifth, Tenth, and D.C. Circuits\" for reconsideration in light of the \"positions asserted by the parties in their supplemental briefs\". Because the Petitioners agreed that \"their religious exercise is not infringed where they 'need to do nothing more than contract for a plan that does not include coverage for some or all forms of contraception'\", the Court held that the parties should be given an opportunity to clarify and refine how this approach would work in practice and to \"resolve any outstanding issues\". The Supreme Court expressed \"no view on the merits of the cases.\" In a concurring opinion, Justice Sotomeyer, joined by Justice Ginsburg noted that in earlier cases \"some lower courts have ignored those instructions\" and cautioned lower courts not to read any signals in the Supreme Court's actions in this case.\n\nIn 2017, the Trump administration issued a ruling letting insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their religious beliefs or moral convictions. However, later that same year federal judge Wendy Beetlestone issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of the Trump administration ruling.\n\nThere are many types of contraceptive methods available. Hormonal methods which contain the hormones estrogen and progestin include oral contraceptive pills (there is also a progestin only pill), transdermal patch (OrthoEvra), and intravaginal ring (NuvaRing). Progestin only methods include an injectable form (Depo-Provera), a subdermal implant (Nexplanon), and the intrauterine device (Mirena). Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper intrauterine device (ParaGard), male and female condoms, male and female sterilization, cervical diaphragms and sponges, spermicides, withdrawal, and fertility awareness. \nIn 2006-2008, the most popular contraceptive methods among those at risk of unintended pregnancy were oral contraceptive pills (25%), female sterilization (24.2%), male condoms (14.5%) and male sterilization (8.8%). Intrauterine device (4.9%), Withdrawal (4.6%). \nDepo-Provera is used by 2.9%, primarily younger women (7.5% of those 15-19 and about 4.5% of those 20-30).\n\nA 2013 Lancet systematic literature review found that among reproductive aged women in a marriage or union, 66% worldwide and 77% in the United States use contraception. Despite this unintended pregnancy remains high; just under half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended. 10.6% of women at risk of unintended pregnancy did not use a contraceptive method, including 18.7% of teens and 14.3% of those 20-24. Women of reproductive age (15 to 44) who are not regarded as at risk for unintended pregnancy include those who are sterile, were sterilized for non-contraceptive reasons, were pregnant or trying to become pregnant, or had not had sex in the 3 months prior to the survey. When examining reasons why women do not use birth control, s 2007 Pregnancy Risk Monitoring Assessment System (PRAMS) survey of over 8000 women with a recent unintended pregnancy found that 33% felt they could not get pregnant at the time of conception, 30% did not mind if they got pregnant, 22% stated their partner did not want to use contraception, 16% cited side effects, 10% felt they or their partner were sterile, 10% reported access problems, and 18% selected \"other\".\n\nContraceptive use saves almost US $19 billion in direct medical costs each year.\n\nAccess to Most Effective Birth Control Could Save $12 Billion a Year: Study. ... The cost savings from that drop? About $12 billion in public health care costs each year, according to the new analysis.\n\nContraception has many benefits beyond preventing pregnancy. Combination estrogen-progestin contraceptives can successfully treat dysmenorrhea (painful periods), provide symptom relief from endometriosis, reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and improve anemia related to menstrual blood loss, reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome and premenstrual dysphoric disorder, reduce ovarian and colon cancer risk, reduce moderate acne, prevent of menstrual migraines, and reduce hirsutism (abnormal hair growth). The progestin containing intrauterine device can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and protect against pre-cancerous changes or cancer in the uterus. Condoms (male or female) are the only contraceptive method which protects against acquisition of sexually transmitted infections.\n\nAccording to the New York Times this October 6 of 2017 \"The Trump administration on Friday moved to expand the rights of employers to deny women insurance coverage for contraception and issued sweeping guidance on religious freedom that critics said could also erode civil rights protec[1]tions for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people\".\n\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services \"two rules rolling back a federal requirement that employers must include birth control coverage in their health insurance plans. The rules offer an exemption to any employer that objects to covering contraception services on the basis of sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions\".\n\n\n\nIn two major legal cases that were planned in 2014, the attorneys made an issue of whether a for-profit corporation can be required to provide coverage for contraceptive services to its employees. As of 1 January 2016, women in Oregon will be eligible to purchase a one-year supply of oral contraceptive; this is the first such legislation in the United States and has attracted the attention of California, Washington state and New York.\n\nIn 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services changed the previous federal requirement for employers to cover birth control in the health insurance plans for their employees. Under this new rule, hundreds of thousands of women would lose their ability to have their birth control costs covered for them. The new rule would let insurers and employers refuse to provide birth control if doing so went against their \"religious beliefs\" or \"moral convictions\". However, later in 2017 federal judge Wendy Beetlestone issued an injunction temporarily stopping the enforcement of this new rule.\n\n\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court decided that for-profit corporations may offer insurance plans that do not cover contraception, by the rationale that the owners may hold that certain contraceptives violate their religious beliefs. This was a setback for the federal government's attempt to create a uniform set of health care insurance benefits.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "725252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=725252", "title": "Broadway theatre", "text": "Broadway theatre\n\nBroadway theatre, commonly known as Broadway, refers to the theatrical performances presented in the 41 professional theatres each with 500 or more seats located in the Theater District and Lincoln Center along Broadway, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Along with London's West End theatre, Broadway theatre is widely considered to represent the highest level of commercial theatre in the English-speaking world.\n\nThe Theater District is a popular tourist attraction in New York City. According to The Broadway League, for the 2017–2018 season (which ended May 27, 2018), total attendance was 13,792,614 and Broadway shows had US$1,697,458,795 in grosses, with attendance up 3.9%, grosses up 17.1%, and playing weeks up 2.8%.\n\nThe majority of Broadway shows are musicals. Historian Martin Shefter argues \"'Broadway musicals,' culminating in the productions of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, became enormously influential forms of American popular culture\" and helped make New York City the cultural capital of the nation.\n\nNew York did not have a significant theatre presence until about 1750, when actor-managers Walter Murray and Thomas Kean established a resident theatre company at the Theatre on Nassau Street, which held about 280 people. They presented Shakespeare plays and ballad operas such as \"The Beggar's Opera\". In 1752, William Hallam sent a company of twelve actors from Britain to the colonies with his brother Lewis as their manager. They established a theatre in Williamsburg, Virginia and opened with \"The Merchant of Venice\" and \"The Anatomist\". The company moved to New York in the summer of 1753, performing ballad operas and ballad-farces like \"Damon and Phillida\". The Revolutionary War suspended theatre in New York, but thereafter theatre resumed in 1798, the year the 2,000-seat Park Theatre was built on Chatham Street (now called Park Row). The Bowery Theatre opened in 1826, followed by others.\n\nBy the 1840s, P.T. Barnum was operating an entertainment complex in lower Manhattan. In 1829, at Broadway and Prince Street, Niblo's Garden opened and soon became one of New York's premiere nightspots. The 3,000-seat theatre presented all sorts of musical and non-musical entertainments. In 1844, Palmo's Opera House opened and presented opera for only four seasons before bankruptcy led to its rebranding as a venue for plays under the name Burton's Theatre. The Astor Opera House opened in 1847. A riot broke out in 1849 when the lower-class patrons of the Bowery objected to what they perceived as snobbery by the upper class audiences at Astor Place: \"After the Astor Place Riot of 1849, entertainment in New York City was divided along class lines: opera was chiefly for the upper middle and upper classes, minstrel shows and melodramas for the middle class, variety shows in concert saloons for men of the working class and the slumming middle class.\"\n\nThe plays of William Shakespeare were frequently performed on the Broadway stage during the period, most notably by American actor Edwin Booth who was internationally known for his performance as Hamlet. Booth played the role for a famous 100 consecutive performances at the Winter Garden Theatre in 1865 (with the run ending just a few months before Booth's brother John Wilkes Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln), and would later revive the role at his own Booth's Theatre (which was managed for a time by his brother Junius Brutus Booth, Jr.). Other renowned Shakespeareans who appeared in New York in this era were Henry Irving, Tommaso Salvini, Fanny Davenport, and Charles Fechter.\n\nTheatre in New York moved from downtown gradually to midtown beginning around 1850, seeking less expensive real estate. In the beginning of the 19th century, the area that now comprises the Theater District was owned by a handful of families and comprised a few farms. In 1836, Mayor Cornelius Lawrence opened 42nd Street and invited Manhattanites to \"enjoy the pure clean air.\" Close to 60 years later, theatrical entrepreneur Oscar Hammerstein I built the iconic Victoria Theater on West 42nd Street.\n\nBroadway's first \"long-run\" musical was a 50-performance hit called \"The Elves\" in 1857. In 1870, the heart of Broadway was in Union Square, and by the end of the century, many theatres were near Madison Square. Theatres did not arrive in the Times Square area until the early 1900s, and the Broadway theatres did not consolidate there until a large number of theatres were built around the square in the 1920s and 1930s. New York runs continued to lag far behind those in London, but Laura Keene's \"musical burletta\" \"The Seven Sisters\" (1860) shattered previous New York records with a run of 253 performances. It was at a performance by Keene's troupe of \"Our American Cousin\" in Washington, D.C. that Abraham Lincoln was shot.\nThe first theatre piece that conforms to the modern conception of a musical, adding dance and original music that helped to tell the story, is considered to be \"The Black Crook\", which premiered in New York on September 12, 1866. The production was a staggering five-and-a-half hours long, but despite its length, it ran for a record-breaking 474 performances. The same year, \"The Black Domino/Between You, Me and the Post\" was the first show to call itself a \"musical comedy\".\n\nTony Pastor opened the first vaudeville theatre one block east of Union Square in 1881, where Lillian Russell performed. Comedians Edward Harrigan and Tony Hart produced and starred in musicals on Broadway between 1878 (\"The Mulligan Guard Picnic\") and 1890, with book and lyrics by Harrigan and music by his father-in-law David Braham. These musical comedies featured characters and situations taken from the everyday life of New York's lower classes and represented a significant step forward from vaudeville and burlesque, towards a more literate form. They starred high quality singers (Lillian Russell, Vivienne Segal, and Fay Templeton), instead of the women of questionable repute who had starred in earlier musical forms.\n\nAs transportation improved, poverty in New York diminished, and street lighting made for safer travel at night, the number of potential patrons for the growing number of theatres increased enormously. Plays could run longer and still draw in the audiences, leading to better profits and improved production values. As in England, during the latter half of the century, the theatre began to be cleaned up, with less prostitution hindering the attendance of the theatre by women. Gilbert and Sullivan's family-friendly comic opera hits, beginning with \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" in 1878, were imported to New York (by the authors and also in numerous unlicensed productions). They were imitated in New York by American productions such as Reginald Dekoven's \"Robin Hood\" (1891) and John Philip Sousa's \"El Capitan\" (1896), along with operas, ballets and other British and European hits.\n\nCharles H. Hoyt's \"A Trip to Chinatown\" (1891) became Broadway's long-run champion, holding the stage for 657 performances. This would not be surpassed until \"Irene\" in 1919. In 1896, theatre owners Marc Klaw and A. L. Erlanger formed the Theatrical Syndicate, which controlled almost every legitimate theatre in the US. for the next sixteen years. However, smaller vaudeville and variety houses proliferated, and Off-Broadway was well established by the end of the 19th century.\n\n\"A Trip to Coontown\" (1898) was the first musical comedy entirely produced and performed by African Americans in a Broadway theatre (largely inspired by the routines of the minstrel shows), followed by the ragtime-tinged \"\" (1898), and the highly successful \"In Dahomey\" (1902). Hundreds of musical comedies were staged on Broadway in the 1890s and early 1900s made up of songs written in New York's Tin Pan Alley involving composers such as Gus Edwards, John Walter Bratton, and George M. Cohan (\"Little Johnny Jones\" (1904), \"45 Minutes From Broadway\" (1906), and \"George Washington Jr.\" (1906)). Still, New York runs continued to be relatively short, with a few exceptions, compared with London runs, until World War I.\nA few very successful British musicals continued to achieve great success in New York, including \"Florodora\" in 1900–01.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, translations of popular late-19th century continental operettas were joined by the \"Princess Theatre\" shows of the 1910s by writers such as P. G. Wodehouse, Guy Bolton, and Harry B. Smith. Victor Herbert, whose work included some intimate musical plays with modern settings as well as his string of famous operettas (\"The Fortune Teller\" (1898), \"Babes in Toyland\" (1903), \"Mlle. Modiste\" (1905), \"The Red Mill\" (1906), and \"Naughty Marietta\" (1910)).\n\nBeginning with \"The Red Mill\", Broadway shows installed electric signs outside the theatres. Since colored bulbs burned out too quickly, white lights were used, and Broadway was nicknamed \"The Great White Way\". In August 1919, the Actors' Equity Association demanded a standard contract for all professional productions. After a strike shut down all the theatres, the producers were forced to agree. By the 1920s, the Shubert Brothers had risen to take over the majority of the theatres from the Erlanger syndicate.\n\nDuring this time, the play \"Lightnin'\", by Winchell Smith and Frank Bacon, became the first Broadway show to reach 700 performances. From then, it would go on to become the first show to reach 1,000 performances. \"Lightnin\"' was the longest-running Broadway show until being overtaken in performance totals by \"Abie's Irish Rose\" in 1925.\n\nThe motion picture mounted a challenge to the stage. At first, films were silent and presented only limited competition. By the end of the 1920s, films like \"The Jazz Singer\" were presented with synchronized sound, and critics wondered if the cinema would replace live theatre altogether. While live vaudeville could not compete with these inexpensive films that featured vaudeville stars and major comedians of the day, other theatre survived. The musicals of the Roaring Twenties, borrowing from vaudeville, music hall and other light entertainments, tended to ignore plot in favor of emphasizing star actors and actresses, big dance routines, and popular songs. Florenz Ziegfeld produced annual spectacular song-and-dance revues on Broadway featuring extravagant sets and elaborate costumes, but there was little to tie the various numbers together. Typical of the 1920s were lighthearted productions such as \"Sally\"; \"Lady Be Good\"; \"Sunny\"; \"No, No, Nanette\"; \"Harlem\"; \"Oh, Kay!\"; and \"Funny Face\". Their books may have been forgettable, but they produced enduring standards from George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Vincent Youmans, and Rodgers and Hart, among others, and Noël Coward, Sigmund Romberg, and Rudolf Friml continued in the vein of Victor Herbert. Clearly, the live theatre survived the invention of cinema.\n\nLeaving these comparatively frivolous entertainments behind, and taking the drama a giant step forward, \"Show Boat\", premiered on December 27, 1927, at the Ziegfeld Theatre, representing a complete integration of book and score, with dramatic themes, as told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement, woven together more seamlessly than in previous musicals. It ran for 572 performances.\n\nThe 1920s also spawned a new age of American playwright with the emergence of Eugene O'Neill, whose plays \"Beyond the Horizon\", \"Anna Christie\", \"The Hairy Ape\", \"Strange Interlude\" and \"Mourning Becomes Electra\" proved that there was an audience for serious drama on Broadway, and O'Neill's success paved the way for major dramatists like Elmer Rice, Maxwell Anderson, Robert E. Sherwood, Tennessee Williams, and Arthur Miller, as well as writers of comedy like George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart. Classical revivals also proved popular with Broadway theatre-goers, notably John Barrymore in \"Hamlet\" and \"Richard III, \"John Gielgud in \"Hamlet\", \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" and \"Much Ado About Nothing\", Walter Hampden and José Ferrer in \"Cyrano de Bergerac\", Paul Robeson and Ferrer in \"Othello\", Maurice Evans in \"Richard II\" and the plays of George Bernard Shaw, and Katharine Cornell in such plays as \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"Antony and Cleopatra\", and \"Candida\".\n\nAs World War II approached, a dozen Broadway dramas addressed the rise of Nazism in Europe and the issue of American non-intervention. The most successful was Lillian Hellman's \"Watch on the Rhine\", which opened in April 1941.\n\nAfter the lean years of the Great Depression, Broadway theatre had entered a golden age with the blockbuster hit \"Oklahoma!\", in 1943, which ran for 2,212 performances. According to John Kenrick writing of Broadway musicals, \"Every season saw new stage musicals send songs to the top of the charts. Public demand, a booming economy and abundant creative talent kept Broadway hopping. To this day, the shows of the 1950s form the core of the musical theatre repertory.\" Kenrick notes that \"the late 1960s marked a time of cultural upheaval. The changes would prove painful for many—including those behind the scenes, as well as those in the audience.\" Of the 1970s, Kenrick writes: \"Just when it seemed that traditional book musicals were back in style, the decade ended with critics and audiences giving mixed signals.\"\n\nKen Bloom observed that \"The 1960s and 1970s saw a worsening of the area [Times Square] and a drop in the number of legitimate shows produced on Broadway.\" By way of comparison, in the 1950 to 1951 season (May to May) 94 productions opened on Broadway; in the 1969 to 1970 season (June to May) there were 59 productions (fifteen were revivals). In the twenties, there were 70–80 theaters but by 1969 there were 36 left.\n\nIn the spring of 1982, Joe Papp, the theatrical producer and director who established The Public Theater, led the \"Save the Theatres\" campaign. It was a not-for-profit group supported by the Actors Equity union, to save the theater buildings in the neighborhood from demolition by monied Manhattan development interests. Papp provided resources, recruited a publicist and celebrated actors, and provided audio, lighting, and technical crews for the effort.\n\nAt Papp's behest, in July 1982, a bill was introduced in the 97th Congress, entitled \"H.R.6885, A bill to designate the Broadway/Times Square Theatre District in the City of New York as a national historic site\". The legislation would have provided certain US government resources and assistance to help the city preserve the district. Faced with strong opposition and lobbying by Mayor Ed Koch's Administration and corporate Manhattan development interests, the bill was not passed. The Save the Theatres campaign then turned their efforts to supporting establishment of the Theater District as a registered historic district. In December 1983, Save the Theatres prepared \"The Broadway Theater District, a Preservation Development and Management Plan\", and demanded that each theater in the district receive landmark designation. Mayor Ed Koch ultimately reacted by creating a Theater Advisory Council, which included Papp.\n\nAlthough there are some exceptions, generally shows with open-ended runs have evening performances Tuesday through Saturday with a 7:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. \"curtain\". The afternoon \"matinée\" performances are at 2:00 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays and at 3:00 p.m. on Sundays. This makes for an eight-performance week. On this schedule, most shows do not play on Monday and the shows and theatres are said to be \"dark\" on that day. The actors and the crew in these shows tend to regard Sunday evening through Monday evening as their weekend. The Tony award presentation ceremony is usually held on a Sunday evening in June to fit this schedule.\n\nIn recent years, some shows have moved their Tuesday show time an hour earlier to 7:00 p.m. The rationale for this move was that since fewer tourists take in shows midweek, Tuesday attendance depends more on local patrons. The earlier curtain makes it possible for suburban patrons to get home by a reasonable hour after the show. Some shows, especially those produced by Disney, change their performance schedules fairly frequently depending on the season. This is done in order to maximize access to their target audience.\n\nMost Broadway producers and theatre owners are members of The Broadway League (formerly \"The League of American Theatres and Producers\"), a trade organization that promotes Broadway theatre as a whole, negotiates contracts with the various theatrical unions and agreements with the guilds, and co-administers the Tony Awards with the American Theatre Wing, a service organization. While the League and the theatrical unions are sometimes at loggerheads during those periods when new contracts are being negotiated, they also cooperate on many projects and events designed to promote professional theatre in New York.\n\nOf the four non-profit theatre companies with Broadway theatres, three (Lincoln Center Theater, Manhattan Theatre Club, and Roundabout Theatre Company) belong to the League of Resident Theatres and have contracts with the theatrical unions which are negotiated separately from the other Broadway theatre and producers. (Disney also negotiates apart from the League, as did Livent before it closed down its operations.) Second Stage Theatre is the non-profit owner of the Helen Hayes Theatre but is not a member of the League of Resident Theatres. However, generally, shows that play in any of the Broadway houses are eligible for Tony Awards (see below).\n\nThe majority of Broadway theatres are owned or managed by three organizations: the Shubert Organization, a for-profit arm of the non-profit Shubert Foundation, which owns seventeen theatres; the Nederlander Organization, which controls nine theatres; and Jujamcyn, which owns five Broadway houses.\n\nBoth musicals and stage plays on Broadway often rely on casting well-known performers in leading roles to draw larger audiences or bring in new audience members to the theatre. Actors from movies and television are frequently cast for the revivals of Broadway shows or are used to replace actors leaving a cast. There are still, however, performers who are primarily stage actors, spending most of their time \"on the boards\", and appearing in television and in screen roles only secondarily. As Patrick Healy of \"The New York Times\" noted:\n\nBroadway once had many homegrown stars who committed to working on a show for a year, as Nathan Lane has for \"The Addams Family\". In 2010, some theater heavyweights like Mr. Lane were not even nominated; instead, several Tony Awards were given for productions that were always intended to be short-timers on Broadway, given that many of their film-star performers had to move on to other commitments.\n\nAccording to Mark Shenton, \"One of the biggest changes to the commercial theatrical landscape—on both sides of the Atlantic—over the past decade or so is that sightings of big star names turning out to do plays has gone up; but the runs they are prepared to commit to has gone down. Time was that a producer would require a minimum commitment from his star of six months, and perhaps a year; now, the 14-week run is the norm.\"\n\nThe minimum size of the Broadway orchestra is governed by an agreement with the musicians union (Local 802, American Federation of Musicians) and The Broadway League. For example, the agreement specifies the minimum size of the orchestra at the Minskoff Theatre to be 18, at the Music Box Theatre to be 9.\n\nMost Broadway shows are commercial productions intended to make a profit for the producers and investors (\"backers\" or \"angels\"), and therefore have open-ended runs (duration that the production plays), meaning that the length of their presentation is not set beforehand, but depends on critical response, word of mouth, and the effectiveness of the show's advertising, all of which determine ticket sales. Investing in a commercial production carries a varied degree of financial risk. Shows do not necessarily have to make a profit immediately. If they are making their \"nut\" (weekly operating expenses), or are losing money at a rate which the producers consider acceptable, they may continue to run in the expectation that, eventually, they will pay back their initial costs and become profitable. In some borderline situations, producers may ask that royalties be temporarily reduced or waived, or even that performers—with the permission of their unions—take reduced salaries, in order to prevent a show from closing. Theatre owners, who are not generally profit participants in most productions, may waive or reduce rents, or even lend a show money in order to keep it running.\n\nSome Broadway shows are produced by non-commercial organizations as part of a regular subscription season—Lincoln Center Theatre, Roundabout Theatre Company, Manhattan Theatre Club, and Second Stage Theater are the four non-profit theatre companies that currently have permanent Broadway venues. Some other productions are produced on Broadway with \"limited engagement runs\" for a number of reasons, including financial issues, prior engagements of the performers or temporary availability of a theatre between the end of one production and the beginning of another. However, some shows with planned limited engagement runs may, after critical acclaim or box office success, extend their engagements or convert to open-ended runs. This was the case with 2007's \"\", 2009's \"God of Carnage\", and 2012's \"Newsies\".\n\nHistorically, musicals on Broadway tend to have longer runs than \"straight\" (i.e. non-musical) plays. On January 9, 2006, \"The Phantom of the Opera\" at the Majestic Theatre became the longest running Broadway musical, with 7,486 performances, overtaking \"Cats\".\n\nAttending a Broadway show is a common tourist activity in New York. The TKTS booths sell same-day tickets (and in certain cases next-day matinee tickets) for many Broadway and Off-Broadway shows at a discount of 20 to 50%. The TKTS booths are located in Times Square, in Lower Manhattan, and at Lincoln Center. This service is run by Theatre Development Fund. Many Broadway theatres also offer special student rates, same-day \"rush\" or \"lottery\" tickets, or standing-room tickets to help ensure that their theatres are as full, and their grosses as high as possible. According to The Broadway League, total Broadway attendance was 13.79 million in 2017–2018 compared to 13.27 million in 2016–2017. The Broadway League also reports that approximately 66% of all Broadway tickets were purchased by tourists in the 2012–2013 season, an increase of three percent from the 2011–2012 season. By way of comparison, London's West End theatre reported total attendance of 14.3 million for major commercial and grant-aided theatres in central London for 2009.\n\nThe classification of theatres is governed by language in Actors' Equity Association contracts. To be eligible for a Tony, a production must be in a house with 500 seats or more and in the Theater District, which criteria define Broadway theatre. Off-Broadway and Off-Off-Broadway shows often provide a more experimental, challenging and intimate performance than is possible in the larger Broadway theatres. Some Broadway shows, however, such as the musicals \"Hair\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\", \"Spring Awakening\", \"Next to Normal\", \"Rent\", \"Avenue Q\", \"In the Heights\", \"Fun Home\", \"Dear Evan Hansen\", and \"Hamilton\", began their runs Off-Broadway and later transferred to Broadway, seeking to replicate their intimate experience in a larger theatre.\n\nAfter, or even during, successful runs in Broadway theatres, producers often remount their productions with new casts and crew for the Broadway national tour, which travels to theatres in major cities across the country. Sometimes when a show closes on Broadway, the entire production, with most if not all of the original cast intact, is relaunched as a touring company, hence the name \"Broadway national tour\". Some shows may even have several touring companies out at a time, whether the show is still running in New York or not, with many companies \"sitting down\" in other major cities for their own extended runs. Smaller cities may attract national touring companies, but for shorter periods of time. Or they may even be serviced by \"bus and truck\" tours. These are scaled-down versions of the larger, national touring productions, historically acquiring their name because the casts generally traveled by bus instead of by air, while the sets and equipment traveled by truck. Tours of this type, which frequently feature a reduced physical production to accommodate smaller venues and tighter schedules, often run for weeks rather than months. Some will even play \"split weeks\", which are half a week in one town and the second half in another. On occasion, they will also play \"one-nighters\". The production values, while generally still good, are usually less lavish than the typical Broadway national tour or national touring production and the actors, while still members of the actor's union, are compensated under a different, less lucrative, union contract. The Touring Broadway Awards, presented by The Broadway League, honored excellence in touring Broadway.\n\nBroadway productions and artists are honored by the annual Antoinette Perry Awards (commonly called the \"Tony Awards\", or \"Tony\") which are given by the American Theatre Wing and The Broadway League, and which were first presented in 1947. The Tony is Broadway's most prestigious award, comparable to the Academy Awards for Hollywood film productions. Their importance has increased since 1967 when the awards presentation show began to be broadcast on national television. In a strategy to improve the television ratings, celebrities are often chosen to host the show, some with scant connection to the theatre. The most recent Tony Awards ceremony was held on June 10, 2018. Other awards given to Broadway productions include the Drama Desk Award, presented since 1955, the New York Drama Critics' Circle Awards, first given in 1936, and the Outer Critics Circle Award, initially presented in 1950.\n\n\nThe following have been announced as future Broadway productions. The theatre in which they will run may not yet be known, or, if known, may be currently occupied by another show.\n\n\n\nExplanatory notes\nCitations\nFurther reading\n\n"}

Most of the content of the catalogue is now available through the British Museum's on-line database.\n\nThe \"BM Satires\" comprises twelve volumes compiled between 1870 and 1954 and provides a catalogue raisonné of the 17,000 odd satirical prints assembled in the 19th century by Edward Hawkins, Keeper of Antiquities in the British Museum from his own and other collections.\n\nIt includes works by all the leading artists and makers of satirical prints of the period, as well as lesser known and anonymous designers. Notable artists represented include: Henry Alken, Samuel Alken, William Austin, James Bretherton, Charles Bretherton, Henry William Bunbury, Frederick George Byron, John Cawse, John Collet, Thomas Colley, George Cruikshank, Isaac Cruikshank, Robert Cruikshank, Matthew Darly, William Dickinson, Robert Dighton, John Dighton, John Doyle, William Elmes, Francis Jukes, James Gillray, Henry Heath, William Heath, John Kay, John Leech, Lewis Marks, Richard Newton, Piercy Roberts, Thomas Rowlandson, F.Sansom, James Sayers, John Raphael Smith, C.Starck, Edward Topham, Henry Wigstead, Samuel de Wilde, Charles Williams, and George \"Moutard\" Woodward. Some works by foreign printmakers are also included.\n\nThe catalogue allocates a unique identifier to each print which is widely used as a bibliographic reference to specific caricatures in books about caricatures and in sales catalogues. The identifiers are one to five digit numbers, allocated in sequential order of listing within the whole sequence of volumes, each volume covering a monotonically increasing range of numbers. For example; BM Satires 10101 refers to a print listed in Volume VIII (which covers the range 9693 to 11703) that was published in September 1803, titled \"My Ass in a Band Box\". For each print, the catalogue provides a title, publisher, designer and creator if known, image description, lettering and inscriptions, dimensions, bibliographic references, and explanatory notes about the historical context and personages and printmaking technique (e.g. etching, aquatint, stipple, hand-coloured, etc.). The prints are for the most part in historical order of date of publication, though some appear out of chronological order in addenda that appear in later volumes. Within each year, Political and Social satire is arranged separately and sequentially.\n\nThere is a prefatory essay to each volume by the editor giving a historical synopsis of printmaking, artists, publishers and events through the period covered by the volume; including Rudolph Ackermann, Bowles & Carver, Thomas Cornell, Elizabeth D'Archeray, John Fairburn, Samuel William Fores, William Holland, Hannah Humphrey, William Humphrey, Elizabeth Jackson, John Kay, Thomas Maclean, John Raphael Smith, Susan Vivares and many others.\n\nThe first five volume of the catalogue were compiled under Frederic George Stephens between 1870 and 1883, with the assistance of Edward Hawkins, Keeper of Antiquities for the British Museum. The last seven volumes were the magnum opus of Mary Dorothy George the distinguished historian of British satire. In 2008–12, as part of the British Museum's program to digitalise its collections, all the volumes were scanned and used to form the basis of the entries for the satirical prints in the British Museum on-line catalogue. Digital images are now available for most of the prints.\n\nThe BM Satires does not include prints acquired since the publication of the printed version of the catalogue (i.e. up until 1954). The British Museum online catalogue includes additional entries for more recent acquisitions. The printed volumes include only a few images, mostly in the introductory essays.\n\n\n"}

The Statue of Liberty, by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi, is a colossal artwork on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, and is a part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Much of the restoration effort was based on unprecedented restorative methods, as metallurgical repair work on such a large scale had never been attempted. Many scientists, engineers, government organizations, and professional consultants evaluated and dealt with the various problems and tasks facing the restoration effort.\n\nThe restored statue was reopened during Liberty Weekend, its 100-year anniversary celebration held July 3–6, 1986.\n\nThe preparations for the centennial celebration of the Statue of Liberty began in 1979. Formed by the National Park Service (NPS), the custodians of the statue since 1933, to investigate possible development alternatives. A report titled \"Analysis of Alternatives\", published in December 1980, proposed measures to remedy the certain conditions confronting visitors to the Statue of Liberty, such as the long lines and waiting time to enter the crown of the statue. The proposed measures included the instatement of systems for numbered ticketing and early warnings that would allow visitors to estimate any possible waiting times and to be conveniently advised if and when to visit or enter the statue. The report also discussed ways to streamline ferry access both to and from Liberty Island and Ellis Island. The early report did not address the ever-deteriorating physical condition of the statue, which was already readily apparent.\n\nThe French American Committee for the Restoration of the Statue of Liberty was formed in May 1981. The Department of the Interior (of which the National Park Service is a bureau) later that month, on May 26, agreed to a working relationship with the Committee. In June 1981, the Committee was incorporated as a non-profit foundation licensed by the state of New York to raise funds for the restoration effort. The Committee hired four French consultants said to have considerable expertise in their respective fields: an architect-engineer, a metals expert, a structural engineer and a mechanical engineer who were asked to compose a technical report on the physical condition of the statue. The French consultants visited Liberty Island in May, June, October and December 1981, before presenting a preliminary white paper to the National Park Service on the seventeenth of December in Washington D.C., titled \"French Technical Report on Restoring the Statue of Liberty\".\n\nThe report, written with the assistance of a regional historical architect from the NPS, was an attempt to identify and address the apparent problems associated with the statue. In the report, the consultants took note of what they saw to be the most serious problem affecting the statue: that two predominant sections, the torch-bearing arm and the rest platform at the head level, had corroded significantly. The report also alluded to the corroded girders toward the top of the pedestal and the bottom of the central pylon. The report also discussed the serious structural problems associated with the long-ago deteriorated insulating layer between the copper sheet of the statue and the iron bands of the structural armature, as it had caused the iron bands to corrode. Alterations over the intervening years (1887–1916) to the torch had created such irreversible damage to the integral stability of that segment, that it was advised in the report that the torch be replaced. In order to more thoroughly assess possible damage that may be hidden beneath the layers of paint on the central pylon, the French consultants also suggested that the layers of paint covering it be removed. Two alternative proposals for modernizing the stairway within the statue were also proposed. From these preliminary observations, a number of preservation and replacement priorities were made. The white paper was further assessed and scrutinized by the NPS and other officials at the Department of the Interior in the nation's capital on March 5, 1982. The director of the NPS was impressed by the report, but also concerned about the future prospects of the Committee’s fund raising efforts.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior announced in May 1982 the creation of a 21-member Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Centennial Commission (better known as the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation) which would act as an \"umbrella group\" overseeing the French American Committee and the Ellis Island Restoration Commission. The Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation would try to privately raise funds for the restoration efforts. A report prepared by the NPS in September 1982, titled \"General Management Plan\", sought to discuss the fundraising aims and objectives of the newly created foundation, but reiterated most of the proposed measures (concerning the statue) of the earlier 1980 report \"Analysis of Alternatives\" (such as numbered ticketing systems, etc.).\n\nEarlier in 1982, the French American Committee began looking for U.S. consultants to complement the technical work already begun by the four French consultants. They would need to prepare a detailed diagnostic report to investigate the conditions of the Statue in further detail, as many of the French consultants were unfamiliar with the construction procedures and standards, and the design and business practices employed in the United States. The inclusion of American participation was of obvious and pragmatic necessity to the restoration work that lay ahead. Several architects, structural engineers, and representatives from the NPS were brought aboard on the project. Construction work would be assigned to American contractors, and by July 1983, a joint diagnostic report was completed by the newly joint group of consultants and presented to NPS officials. By December 1983, the American group assumed many of the responsibilities concerning the design aspect of the project, and by August 1984, the American team terminated its contract with the French American Committee, owing to the Committee’s considerable fundraising problems and other related matters.\n\nJust prior to the restoration efforts, there were an insufficient number of photographs documenting the initial reassembly of the statue (when it had been given), and too few photographs documenting the condition of the statue since its construction that were relevant to the maintenance of the statue. The NPS vowed to support the historical documentation effort, and a photographer was hired to photograph the entirety of the restoration—before, during, and after. Owing to this decision, an archive of two hundred large format photographs—both black and white, and multicolor—were developed for NPS and the Historic American Engineering Record (HAER). According to the \"New York Times\", the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) would also be donating a set of three-dimensional computer drawings of the statue, rendered in the computer-aided design (CAD) program. The drawings were to aid in the future maintenance of the statue. These drawings were later given to the NPS, and were important in analyzing the wind bearing capacity of the structure within the statue.\n\nFrom November 7, 1982, public announcements were made by project officials that the Statue of Liberty would be completely closed to the public for as long as one year beginning in 1984. The statue had been closed only once before for such an extended period of time, and that was at one point in the late 1930s. Later announcements stated that the erection of the scaffolding surrounding the outside of the statue would begin in the fall of 1983, and it was still believed in July 1983 that the restoration would begin sometime in the fall. NPS representatives retracted and revised the earlier announcement concerning the closure of the Island to the public; Liberty Island would in fact remain open and closings would be intermittent and only for several days at a time at most. The restoration would not begin until January 23, 1984. An article from \"The New York Times\" published the day after, indicated that the 30-month project had officially begun the day before, and that visitors would have approximately two weeks remaining before the statue would be completely enshrouded by the tons of extruded aluminum scaffolding that had just been deposited on Liberty Island.\n\nThe scaffolding contract was awarded to a company called Universal Builders Supply (UBS) Inc. on December 14, 1983. The contract stipulated that the freestanding exterior scaffold was to be completely assembled by April 27, 1984. The high scaffolding was designed specifically for the statue, and required ingenuity from its designers, as it could only be attached to the granite pedestal and not the statue and had to accommodate the intricate contours of the statue as well. Furthermore, the exterior scaffolding had to maintain a distance of at least 18 inches from any exposed section of the copper sheathing. The 6,000 or so separate components of the scaffold, made of a high load capacity aluminum (alloy 6061 T6), were unloaded onto Liberty Island on January 23, 1984. To prevent possible rust stains from affecting the exterior patina of the statue, the pretext was adopted of using aluminum. Screw jacks were used to brace the aluminum against the granite pedestal of the statue. More easily an interior scaffolding was developed made of interlocking pipes held together with friction clamps and anchored to the central pylon of the statue for structural support. The twenty UBS workers often resorted to assembling the interior scaffolding when the severe winds and dreadful winter weather conditions prevented them from continuing their work outside.\n\nOnce the interior scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of the interior coatings was executed. The acknowledged presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would be removed from the interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A \"New York Times\" article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted \"government green\" would be cleaned to resemble the salmon color of a new penny. That outermost \"government green\" layer was a vinyl paint applied in 1975.\nBecause certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of red lead primer plus six additional coats) and the two layers of bituminous paint (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: thermal coating removal, abrasive coating removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against flash rusting, The low dusting abrasive material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.\n\nSeveral coating removal methods for the interior copper were ruled out. According to the evaluative research completed, the abrasive removal method (involving aluminum oxide) could damage the underlying layer of the copper substrate. Highly flammable and toxic chemical removal methods were ruled out, as they would have been far too time consuming and could have negatively affected the delicate patina of the exterior (if seepage of the chemicals were to have occurred).\n\nTwo researchers, an architectural conservator from Columbia University and a historical architect working for the (North Atlantic Historic Preservation Center) NAHPC sought to address the attendant difficulties of removing the different layers of paint without further damaging the statue. The researchers finally decided upon an innovative cryogenic removal method, in which liquid nitrogen was sprayed on the paint-covered surface. The liquid nitrogen would em-brittle the layers of the paint at , causing the cracking paint to lose the adherent properties it once possessed. It was estimated that approximately of liquid nitrogen would be needed for the interior coating removal. According to the researchers, \"the use of liquid nitrogen in large scale coating removal was somewhat innovative.\" The moist squirt gun division of the Union Carbide Corporation of Danbury, Connecticut, which at the time was \"the largest producer of liquid atmospheric gases in the United States\", donated the liquid nitrogen for the restoration efforts. The company’s researchers also worked with the NPS in fabricating special tools for controlling the application of the liquid nitrogen.\n\nThe cryogenic method was inadequate for the removal of the two final layers of bituminous coating that were below the surface of the seven layers of lead and vinyl based paints. A small yet powerful sandblasting tool that would sandblast and vacuum simultaneously was developed specifically for the removal of the stubborn coating. The tool devised by the Blast and Vac company of Bolivar, Ohio, was \"a standard blasting nozzle inside a vacuum cleaner head\". A commercial grade bicarbonate of soda (baking soda), manufactured by Arm & Hammer was donated and applied as the cleaning agent that would be abrasive yet gentle on the copper sheathing. The baking soda leaked through the holes and crevices in the sheathing, and was affecting the coloration of the patina on the external side of the statue so the workers would rinse the outer surface of the statue, to prevent the baking soda from turning the green patina of the statue blue.\n\nOnce the layers of paint had been removed from the interior of the statue, the architects and engineers knew that a coating system far more suitable than any of the preexisting applications that had been used, would need to be implemented to protect the iron of the statue’s interior. The coating would have to be able to provide protection against corrosion in a marine environment and have to have a zero level VOC (volatile organic compound) emission rating. A coating was sought for the sandblasted central pylon and the secondary framework, and found.\n\nIn 1970, a patent was awarded to NASA for a zinc silicate primer coating called K-Zinc 531, the name owing to the ratio of silicon/potassium to water being 5:3:1. The coating had the following characteristics: it was non-toxic, non-flammable, and would dry smoothly on metals within half an hour of surface application. In 1981, NASA granted the license for the coating to Shane Associates of Wynnewood, Pennsylvania. In 1982 a company called Inorganic Coatings (IC) based in Malvern, a borough in Chester county Pennsylvania, signed an agreement with the former company to become the sole manufacturer and sales agent of the zinc silicate variant. The protective coating was renamed IC 531, but much like the original coating developed by NASA was a high-ratio waterborne zinc silicate. The IC 531 was used in the restoration efforts to provide a number of the structural elements of the statue with superior corrosion resistance.\n\nAlthough many of the armature bars were replaced in 1937-38, the restoration effort involved the successful attempt to replace nearly every ribbon like armature bar that made up the unique internal structure of the statue (as the bars are not connected to the copper skin, but are held in place by the copper saddles that are riveted into the copper skin). A \"New York Times\" article from December 17, 1985 indicated that the most serious internal problem with the statue was the corrosion that had taken place in the iron armatures which provide the support to the copper sheathing. Eiffel knew that galvanic reaction would immediately pose a problem, owing to the dissimilarity of the metals used in the statue (copper and iron), which unless insulated would corrode rapidly. However, the method used to try and prevent galvanic corrosion of the armature system had proven to be ineffective. \n\nThe original insulating layer implemented between the copper sheathing and the iron bars was an asbestos cloth soaked in shellac. This insulating and isolating system had separated the two metals when it was constructed, but the ingeniously devised system had broken down over time and was compromising the structural stability of many different components. The insulating layer had lost much of its functional isolating capacity due to exposure to interior condensation, leakage and possibly from other variable atmospheric effects of the marine environment. It had deteriorated into a sponge-like material which merely retained the saltwater as a conductive electrolyte. Hastening the decline of the corroded iron, the buildup of corrosive discharge exerted pressure on the riveted copper saddles that had held the iron bars in place. This created buckling and warping, and further caused the rivets to become disjointed. Rainwater would seep into the holes in the copper sheathing which once held the disjointed rivets. Some of the seams and holes were still sealed and coated with a coal tar paint applied in 1911. The streaks of coal tar paint from when it had been applied 74 years earlier were still visible during the restoration efforts. Black tar streaks from these so-called \"weep holes\" were running down the exterior of the statue and had altered the patina of the external copper sheathing.\n\nAn atmospheric research scientist and a technical assistant from AT&T Bell Laboratories, developed a greenish liquid composed of corroded copper particles roughly matching the statue's exterior in chemical composition, which was then sprayed over the tar streaked exterior. The sprayed on particles were then left to develop and spread over the streaks and stains. Both researchers, specializing in the study of the corrosion on copper and copper alloys became interested in the restoration efforts and proposed to donate their expertise to the restoration effort as it would afford them with an opportunity to study the effects of the atmosphere on the hundred year old copper structure.\n\nCopper was considered as a possible alternative metal for the replication of the \"puddled\" iron armatures, but was ruled out. The NPS performed tests to assess the suitability of possible replacement materials for the iron bars. 316L stainless steel was selected to replace the approximately 1800 iron armature bars, and Ferralium, a steel-aluminum alloy, was chosen to replace the flat bars that connect the secondary framework to the armature. As the armatures provide the structural support for the copper skin, it was determined that no more than four bars from each of four different sections of the statue (for a total of sixteen bars) be removed at any given time. These were then replicated mostly by eye, and the replacements installed within 36 hours of the removal of the original. An art restoration company working along with a steel contractor undertook the difficult task.\n\nReplacement bars were annealed and sandblasted to remove iron filings and other contaminants that would or could eventually cause the stainless steel to rust, and then dipped in nitric acid for protection. The \"long term service behavior\" of 316L stainless steel, according to a professor of metallurgy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who had some involvement in the early stages of the restoration effort, was not known. The replacement bars of the iron grid system were insulated from the copper with a PTFE (Teflon) polymer resin tape produced by the DuPont company.\n\nA \"New York Times\" article from May 31, 1986 reported that inspection crews overseeing the restoration efforts had noticed several months earlier that a five foot long armature bar near one of the arms had been stamped with the forty names of the forty iron workers who had installed the armatures. The bar, which had to be replaced, was paid for by the contractors. Before being replaced, the bar was photographed; the image is in the June 1986 issue of \"Smithsonian\" magazine.\n\nThe torch was removed from the statue on July 4, 1984. An article in \"The New York Times\" from October 8, 1984, stated that the new torch is to be completed in the same manner that the old torch was made in 14 months by ten craftsmen from Les metalliers Champenois based in Reims, and that a workshop at the statue's base on Liberty Island had been made accessible to the public that month.\n\nWithin the copper body of the statue is the structural support system consisting of a 97-foot (30 m) central pylon, which is the backbone of the statue. The pylon consists of four girders with horizontal and diagonal cross bracing systems, which provide support to the secondary framework and to the armature, and a 40-foot (12 m) long extension that supports the raised arm and torch. It had been a well-documented fact at least since 1932 (when the War Department reinforced the arm-shoulder structure), that the support for the shoulder of the upheld arm had been misaligned. Then, it was discovered that the arch that supports the head of the statue had also been misaligned. The cause(s) of the misalignments are undetermined, but a few hypotheses have been suggested. The first hypothesis proposed was that Viollet le Duc—the engineer who initially worked on the project with Bartholdi and who designed the structural reinforcement of the arm and the head (displayed in 1876 at the Centennial exhibition in Philadelphia) had died after having completed those two sections—and had employed engineering methods that differed significantly from those of the better-known bridge engineer Gustave Eiffel, who had finished the remainder of the work on the statue, and who is generally credited for the statue's remarkable structure. The second hypothesis was that the Americans, after having uncrated the different sections of the statue in 1886, incorrectly reassembled the structural framework. The third hypothesis is that the statue’s creator, Bartholdi, was aesthetically dissatisfied when the statue was fully assembled and displayed in Paris on or just prior to July 4, 1884, and that he must have willingly sacrificed the structural integrity for his aesthetic vision.\n\nOne of the main architects of the restoration project was initially convinced that the second hypothesis was correct, but according to a quoted and published statement, recent research had convinced him of the veracity of the third hypothesis. The most significant problems were consequences of poor design and construction choices implemented initially, but Eiffel could not have directly been responsible for such glaring mistakes according to the (same) architect. Computer aided design drawings were used to illustrate how the head and the hand wielding the torch had been misaligned, and how the misalignment had caused the spikes of the crown to damage a section of the torch-bearing arm. The \"13 trouble spots of the statue\" were visually emphasized in a front page \"New York Times\" article from July 20, 1983. The head was off center and the upheld arm was away from where it was designed to be.\n\nWith the computer simulations of the CAD program, the architects were able to assess the likelihood of implementing either of the following options to address the misalignment issue: the option of rebuilding the arm-shoulder connection as Eiffel had envisioned it, or they could strengthen the preexisting misalignment by adding new diagonal bracing and steel plates. The latter option would have the intended effect of further reinforcing the repairs that had been made when the problem was initially noticed in 1932 by the War department when it had jurisdiction over the statue. Regardless, the \"finite element analysis\" of the computer simulation showed that both solutions would work. Additional supports were also added inside the head to improve overall stability. Hence, the positions of the arm and the head would remain as they had been since they were reassembled on Bedloe's Island in 1886.\n\nAccording to the \"New York Times\", the architects on the project assured the reporter that despite the misalignment, \"cosmetic changes\" to the statue would not take place. Several commentators on the historic restoration project seemed to have reiterated a similar guiding sentiment: that preservation rather than unnecessary replacement would be the objective of the current restoration effort. This was quite reassuring, in the light of proposals put forward early on during the restoration efforts such as the following: \"cleaning and polishing of the statue’s exterior; demolition of the statue, selling of the copper and the use of the funds raised to build an exact duplicate in fiberglass; the application of an epoxy coating to the exterior and the construction of a competing monument...\"\n\nA \"New York Times\" article from February 8, 1984 mentioned that the idea to have an elevator that would reach to the crown of the statue had been recently abandoned. A double level hydraulic glass elevator would be installed inside the base of the statue from which visitors would be able to access the crown by ascending a few steps. Much of the interior had been reconstructed, with a great deal of emphasis placed on enhancing the visitors experience, as the original structure was not devised with the visitor in mind, poor lighting conditions, no ventilation and a very inadequate and basic heating system were to be changed.\n\nPrior to the restoration, much of the internal structure of the statue was out of sight behind the mesh wire walls of the original helical stairs. It should be noted that the stairs were originally intended for workmen. Neither the architect nor the artist had envisioned that the lady would welcome visitors internally. Elevators were first installed in 1908–9. A \"New York Times\" article published less than a month and a half from the centennial celebration, discussed the changes within the statue as being the most spectacular. The journalist added: that \"now that the walls have been removed, what is revealed is an interior that seems to combine the toughness of 19th century industrial construction and the grace of a cathedral.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "439002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439002", "title": "Curitiba", "text": "Curitiba\n\nCuritiba ( \"Araucaria Nut Land\", ) is the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Paraná. The city's population numbered approximately 1,879,355 people , making it the eighth most populous city in the country, and the largest in Brazil's South Region. The Curitiba Metropolitan area comprises 26 municipalities with a total population of over 3.2 million (IBGE estimate in 2010), making it the seventh most populous in the country.\n\nCuritiba is an important cultural, political, and economic centre in Latin America. The city sits on a plateau at above sea level. It is located west of the seaport of Paranaguá and is served by the Afonso Pena International and Bacacheri airports. The city hosts the Federal University of Paraná, established in 1912.\n\nIn the 1700s, Curitiba possessed a favorable location between cattle-breeding country and marketplaces, leading to a successful cattle trade and the city's first major expansion. Later, between 1850 and 1950, it grew due to logging and agricultural expansion in the Paraná State (first Araucaria logging, later mate and coffee cultivation and in the 1970s wheat, corn and soybean cultivation). In the 1850s, waves of European immigrants arrived in Curitiba, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians, contributing to the city's economic and cultural development. Nowadays, only smaller numbers of foreign immigrants arrive, primarily from Middle Eastern and other South American countries.\n\nThe biggest expansion occurred after the 1960s, with innovative urban planning that changed the population size from some hundreds of thousands to more than a million people. Curitiba's economy is based on industry and services and is the fourth largest in Brazil. Economic growth occurred in parallel to a substantial inward flow of Brazilians from other cities of the country, as approximately half of the city's population was not born in Curitiba.\n\nCuritiba sports one of the few high Brazilian Human Development Index readings at 0.856, and in 2010 was awarded the Global Sustainable City Award, given to cities and municipalities that excel in sustainable urban development. According to US magazine \"Reader's Digest\", Curitiba is the best \"Brazilian Big City\" in which to live. Curitiba crime rate is considered low by Brazilian standards and the city is considered one of the safest cities in Brazil for youth. The city is also the best to invest in the country. Curitiba was one of the host cities of the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and again for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Despite its good social indicators, the city has a higher unemployment rate compared to other cities in the state.\n\nOne theory is that the name \"Curitiba\" comes from the Tupi words \"kurí tyba\", \"many pine seeds\" due to the large number of pinecones of Paraná pines in the region prior to its founding. Another version, also using words from the Tupi language, is that it originates in the combination of \"kurit\" (pine tree) and \"yba\" (large amount).\n\nThe Portuguese, who founded a settlement on the site in 1693, named it \"Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais\" (Village of \"Our Lady of the Light\" of the Pines). The name was changed to \"Curitiba\" in 1721. Curitiba officially became a town in 1812, spelling its name as \"Curityba.\" An alternative spelling was \"Coritiba.\" This was used in press and state documents. A state decree in 1919 settled the dispute by adopting \"Curitiba.\"\n\nAt the end of the 17th century, Curitiba's agriculture was only for subsistence and its main economic activities were mineral extraction. Waves of European immigrants arrived after 1850, mainly Poles, Italians, Germans (mostly from Russia) and Ukrainians.\n\nCattlemen drove their herds from Rio Grande do Sul to the state of São Paulo, turning Curitiba into an important intermediate trading post.\nThe Paranaguá-Curitiba railroad was opened in 1885.\n\nAround the beginning of the 20th century, Curitiba benefited from the wealth of the yerba mate mills. The owners (known as \"barões da erva-mate\") built mansions in the capital. These have mostly been preserved in the districts of Batel and Alto da Glória.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce its first city plan. It emphasized a \"star\" of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed in part, but the plan was too expensive to complete.\n\nCuritiba has a subtropical highland climate (a form of oceanic or maritime temperate climate) (\"Cfb\"), according to the Köppen classification and the Brazilian government classification. Located in Southern Brazil, the humid city lies in a temperate zone. It is located on a plateau and the flat terrain with flooded areas contribute to its mild and damp winter, with an average minimum temperature of in the coldest month, occasionally falling below on the coldest nights. During summertime, the average temperature is around at daytime, but it can get above on the hottest days. Snowfall was experienced in 1889, 1892, 1912, 1928 (two days), 1942, 1955, 1957, 1962, 1975, 1988 and again in 2013.\n\nThe terrain's flatness hinders water drainage after rain, therefore providing water vapor for the atmosphere. Cold fronts come year round, often from Antarctica and Argentina, bringing tropical storms in summer and cold winds in the winter. They can move very quickly, with no more than one day between the start of the southern winds and the start of rain. Curitiba's weather is also influenced by the dry air masses that dominate Brazil's midwest most of the year, bringing hot and dry weather, sometimes even in winter.\nCuritiba is located in the area of the Ombrophilous Mixed Forest (also known as Araucaria moist forests), a sub-type of the Atlantic Forest. In Curitiba it is possible to find steppes, forests and other formations. The local vegetation consists of remnants of the Paraná (or Brazilian) pine (\"Araucaria angustifolia\"), which resisted the efforts of settlers. The Paraná pines are in private and public areas and are protected from logging. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a botanical garden and three greenhouses that produce 150,000 native and exotic seedlings: 16,000 fruit trees, 260,000 flowers, foliage and underbrush specimens and the maintenance of another 350,000 seedlings.\n\nCuritiba's green area itself matches the size of other large Brazilian cities. The vegetation of Curitiba encompasses a large population of purple and yellow \"ipês\" (tabebuias), making a beautiful sight during flowering at winter's end. The yellow ipê is the city's most common tree.\n\nThe catchment area of Curitiba consists of rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the city's watershed are: Atuba River, Belém River, Barigüi River, Passaúna River, Ribeirão dos Padilhas and the Iguaçu River, all with characteristics of dendritic drainage. Curitiba has been working since the 1970s on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of urbanization on rivers. An example is the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which absorb and retain water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods.\nAfter many studies of local water flows, most rivers were found to be subject to a canalization process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the negative effects of urbanization are the implementation of programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works.\n\nThe city covers on the First Plateau of Paraná. Curitiba has a topography of smooth, rounded hills, giving it a relatively regular shape. The city has an average altitude of above sea level. The highest point is to the north at , and with lower altitudes at to the south. Mountain ranges and sets of rocky hills surround parts of the city, including the \"Serra do Mar\", a hill range between the shore of the Atlantic Ocean and the First Plateau in Paraná.\n\n, the mayor is Rafael Greca, who replaced Gustavo Fruet. The City Council of Curitiba has 38 councillors elected since 2004. Curitiba is divided into nine regional governments (equivalent to subprefecture), who manage the municipality's 75 districts. The \"Rua da Cidadania\" (\"Street of Citizenship\") is the symbol of administrative decentralization; it is a reference point and a meeting place. Several units are annexed to public transport terminals. Their nuclei offer services in the local, state and federal areas.\n\nJaime Lerner is perhaps Curitiba's best-known mayor. He has been mayor three times, the first time in the early 1970s. His leadership was crucial to some major changes in the city. Curitiba has built parks instead of canals to reduce flooding; used parks to make the city more liveable; pedestrianised the downtown area; invented and built Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), a bus system that works like a light rail system but is 10 times cheaper; and started a massive recycling scheme that included giving people bus tokens in return for waste.\n\nTime magazine listed this former mayor among the world's most influential thinkers of 2010. In the days before free, direct elections, mayors were political appointees who were no more than pawns in the game of power politics and were subject to replacement at any time. For an idealistic young architect like Lerner, retaining the mayor's office was particularly precarious. Those holding the reins of power at the time were under the mistaken impression that Lerner's youth would make him easy to control. As it turned out, he was no milquetoast, and subsequently set about enthusiastically pursuing reform.\n\nAccording to the 2010 IBGE Census, 1,678,965 people resided in the city of Curitiba. The census revealed 1,381,938 White people (78.9%), 294,127 Pardo (Multiracial) people (16.8%), 49,978 Black people (2.9%), 23,138 Asian people (1.4%), 2,693 Amerindian people (0.2%).\n\nIn 2010, Curitiba was Brazil's 8th most populous city.\n\nIn 2010, the city had 359,201 opposite-sex couples and 974 same-sex couples. The population of Curitiba was 52.3% female and 47.7% male.\n\nAs with most of Southern Brazil's population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by European descendents. The first Europeans to arrive were of Portuguese origin, during the 17th century. They intermarried with the native people and with the African slaves.\n\nUp until the 19th century, the inhabitants of the city of Curitiba were natives and mixed-race, Portuguese and Spanish immigrants. In 1808 foreigners were granted the right to ownership of land, and in 1853 Parana became an independpent province, and these events resulted in a substantial number so of immigrants from Europe.\n\nThe first non-Iberic (Portuguese and Spaniard) immigrants to come to the city were German.\n\nThe Memorial of Polish Immigration was inaugurated on 13 December 1980, after the visit of Pope John Paul II in June. Its area is and was part of the former Candles plant. The seven wooden log houses are parts of this memorial area, as a memento of the Polish immigrants' struggles and faith. Objects like an old wagon, pipe of cabbage and a print of the Black Madonna of Częstochowa (patron saint of the Polish people), form parts of the memorial. The first group of Poles arrived in Curitiba around 1871. Curitiba has the biggest colony of Polish immigrants in Brazil.\n\nItalian immigrants started arriving in Brazil in 1875 and in Curitiba in 1878, coming mainly from the Veneto and Trento regions of Northern Italy. They settled mostly in the \"Santa Felicidade\" neighborhood, still a centre of the Italian community.\n\nNearly 20,000 Ukrainian immigrants settled there between 1895 and 1897, consisting mostly of peasants from Galicia who emigrated to Brazil to become farmers. Around 300,000 Ukrainian-Brazilians live in Paraná. The State of Paraná has the largest Ukrainian community and Slavic community.\n\nCuritiba has a Jewish community that was originally established in the 1870s. Much of the early Jewish congregation has been assimilated. In 1937 with the rise of Nazi Germany, notable German Jewish academics migrated to Brazil, some settling in Curitiba. Physicist César Lattes and former mayors Jaime Lerner and Saul Raiz were Jewish. A Holocaust memorial is present in the city. The community centre, a Jewish school, a Chabad house (Beit Chabad), a synagogue, and two Jewish cemeteries are there, one of which was defiled in 2004.\n\nJapanese immigrants began arriving in 1915, with a larger contingent arriving in 1924. Curitiba received a significant Japanese influx. They settled mostly between Paraná and São Paulo state. The city has the second largest Japanese community in Brazil, behind only São Paulo, according to IBGE. Although both cities have around the same proportion of Japanese descendants, other large cities in the countryside, such as Maringá and Londrina, have an even higher rate. Some estimates suggest that more than 40,000 Japanese-Brazilians live in Curitiba.\n\nSince it was declared capital of the State of Paraná in 1853, the city has gone through several major urban planning projects to avoid uncontrolled growth and thus has become an international role model in dealing with issues including transportation and the environment. The city is Brazil's second largest car manufacturer. Its economy is based on industry, commerce and services. For that reason, Curitiba is considered by many investors to be the best location for investment in Brazil.\n\nThe city receives more than two million tourists every year. Most arrive via Afonso Pena International Airport, where almost 60,000 flights land annually.\n\nAccording to IPEA data, the GDP in 2006 was 32 billion reals, without including agriculture and livestock (0.03%). Industry represented 34.13% and the commerce and service sectors 65.84%. Cidade Industrial de Curitiba, the industrial district, is home to many multinational industries, such as Nissan, Renault, Volkswagen, Philip Morris, Audi, Volvo, HSBC, Siemens, ExxonMobil, Electrolux and Kraft Foods, as well as many well-known national industries, such as Sadia, O Boticário and Positivo Informática.\n\nCuritiba's infrastructure makes bus travel fast and convenient, effectively creating demand for bus use in the same way that the infrastructure of traditional cities creates demand for private motor vehicles. In July 2001, Curitiba became Brazil's first city to receive the prize \"Pole of Information Technology\", granted by \"InfoExame\" magazine. According to the magazine, the companies of \"Technology and Information Technology\" based in Curitiba in 2001 achieved in revenues, representing a growth of 21% over the previous year.\nThe city's 30-year economic growth rate is 7.1%, higher than the national average of 4.2%, and per capita income is 66% higher than the Brazilian average. Between 1975 and 1995, Curitiba's domestic product grew by some 75% more than the entire State of Paraná, and 48% more than Brazil as a whole. In 1994, tourism generated , 4% of the city's net income. Curitiba has municipal health, education and day care networks, neighborhood libraries shared by schools and citizens and Citizenship Streets, where buildings provide essential public services, sports and cultural facilities near transportation terminals. At the Open University, residents can take courses in subjects such as mechanics, hair styling and environmental protection for a small fee. Policies for job creation and income generation became part of the city's strategic planning in the 1990s, for the metropolitan area as well as the city.\nSince 1990, the Municipal Housing Fund has provided financial support to housing for lower income populations. After national housing finance collapsed in 1985, just as people from the countryside poured into Curitiba, the city's public housing program bought one of the few remaining large plots of land, \"Novo Bairro\" (New Neighborhood), as home for 50,000 families. While landowners built the houses themselves, each received a pair of trees and an hour's consultation with an architect to help them develop their plan. COHAB also built Technology Street, an avenue of 24 homes in the centre of Novo Bairro, each built using different construction techniques.\n\nSeven massive shopping malls are found in Curitiba shopping: Mueller, Estação, Curitiba, Crystal, Palladium, Patio Batel and Park Barigüi. The Rua das Flores (Street of Flowers) is home to the majority of stores. The area is pedestrianized, with no cars around the centre. An essential element of Curitiba shopping is the Feira do Largo da Ordem, or Largo da Ordem Street Fair.\n\nIn 2008, according to IBGE Curitiba´s nominal GDP was (or about of ) (with , or , by nominal GDP per capita, about of more than Brazilian 2008 nominal GDP per capita), making it the fourth richest city in the country, after only São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and the capital Brasília.\n\nCuritiba is the 2nd Pole on Technological Innovation in Brazil, according to IPEA (Applied Economic Research Institute). The\n2nd Brazil's Best City for Business and 5th South American Best City for Business, according to America Economia Magazine/2005 and 2006. The Best Destination for Business, according to Veja Magazine of 2007. The 3rd position among the Champions of Infrastructure, Exame Magazine of 2006. The 2nd Best City to Work in Southern Brazil, according to Você S.A. Magazine of 2005. The 49th Position, MasterCard Worldwide Centers of Commerce: Emerging Markets Index of 2008. One of the highlights according to the survey Offshoring Horizons performed by Watson Wyatt of 2007. One of the 10 global sustainability centres, according to Ethisphere Institute of 2008. Curitiba is also home to the largest cancer hospital in the South of Brazil, Erasto Gaertner Hospital.\n\nAttractions in the city include:\n Families are often seen picnicking on the grounds.\n\nMore than 183 universities operate in the state of Paraná.\n\n\nIn the 1990s, the city started a project called \"Faróis do Saber\" (\"Lighthouses of Knowledge\"). These lighthouses are free educational centres that include libraries, Internet access and other cultural resources. Libraries work with municipal schools, offering a collection of approximately 5000 books, and provide cultural reference and leisure.\n\nAmong Brazilian capitals, Curitiba has the highest literacy rate, and ranks number 1 in education among the Brazilian capitals.\n\nCuritiba has a planned transportation system, which includes lanes on major streets devoted to a bus rapid transit system. The buses are split into three sections (bi-articulated) and stop at designated elevated tubes, complete with access for disabled riders. Buses charge one price regardless of distance.\n\nThe city preserves and cares for its green areas, boasting of green space per inhabitant.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, cofounder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a star of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. The plan was too expensive to complete.\n\nBy the 1960s, Curitiba's population had reached 430,000. Some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to damage the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect Jaime Lerner, who later became mayor, led a team from the Universidade Federal do Paraná that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, reduced traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector and a convenient and affordable public transit system.\n\nThis plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed XV de Novembro St. to vehicles, because it had high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This used two one-way streets moving in opposite directions that surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have an exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges on the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density development, to pull traffic away from the main roads. In a number of areas subject to floods, buildings were condemned and the land became parks.\n\nToday, Curitiba is considered one of the world's best examples of urban planning. In June 1996, the chairman of the Habitat II summit of mayors and urban planners in Istanbul praised Curitiba as \"the most innovative city in the country.\"\n\nCuritiba was recently recommended by UNESCO as a model for the reconstruction of the cities of Afghanistan. In the 1980s, the RIT (Rede Integrada de Transporte, \"Integrated Transport Network\") was created. At the same time, the city began building the \"Faróis de Saber\" (\"Lighthouses of Knowledge\") educational centres. The city has more than of public parks and forests.\n\nIn 2007, the city placed third in a list of \"15 Green Cities\" in the world, according to \"Grist\" magazine, after Reykjavík in Iceland and Portland, Oregon in the United States. As a result, according to one survey, 99% of Curitibans are happy with their hometown.\n\nJaime Lerner suggests urban acupuncture as the future solution for contemporary urban issues; focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities, can create positive ripple effects. Urban \"acupuncture\" reclaims land for the public and emphasizes the importance of community development through small interventions in design of cities. It emphasises pinpoint interventions that can be accomplished quickly to create a make an immediate impact.\n\nThe \"capacity building job line\" was created to accelerate economic development. Key initiatives include the South-Circular bus line, which links the southern and eastern regions of town; Entrepreneurial \"Sheds\", business incubators designed to help small companies get established and prosper; and the Crafts Lycée, which trains people for professions such as marketing and finance. Specifically, the goal is to provide jobs and income for the unemployed among 400,000 people living in 15 peripheral towns, and to structure and develop the region according to integrated planning principles. About 15,000 new jobs were generated by 2013.\n\nAccording to Jonas Rabinovitch, a United Nations senior adviser and former planner at the \"Curitiba Research and Urban Planning Institute\" (IPPUC), up to 8% of Curitiba's population still lived in favelas as of 2016. According to 2010 census data collected by IBGE, 49.7 thousand homes in Curitiba form part of irregular settlements. This is equivalent to 163.3 thousand people. The population growth of favelas was 12.4% between 2000 and 2010, higher than the population in general (10.3%).\n\nThe transit service is used by more than 2 million people a day. Curitiba has more car owners per capita than anywhere else in Brazil. The population has doubled since 1974, yet auto traffic declined by 30%, and atmospheric pollution is the lowest in Brazil.\n\nIn January 1973 the Fundação Cultural de Curitiba was set up, with the aim of promoting culture.\n\nThe Cultural Complex Solar do Barão features the Photography Museum, the Engravings Museum and the Posters Museu. The MuMA - Museu Metropolitano de Arte (Museum of Metropolitan Art) displays artists from the state of Paraná as well as renowned Brazilian painters such as Pancetti, Guignard and Di Cavalcanti\n\nThe Polish Immigrants Memorial, also known as The Pope's Woods, offers an enjoyable area surrounded by trees, which makes it a perfect choice for a stroll. The Pope himself blessed the first replica of the traditional Polish houses that beautifully make up the Bosque do Papa when he visited the city in 1980.\n\nIn 2003, Curitiba received the \"American Capital of Culture\" title, granted by the OAS (Organization of American States).\nCuritiba was Brazil's first city to have an IMAX movie theatre. Curitiba has many theaters. The largest and most important one is the Guaíra Theater. Every year, in April, it hosts the Curitiba Theater Festival.\n\nBrazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer designed the extravagant state museum of Curitiba. Its design includes a gravity-defying construction that was intended to look like a Paraná Pine, one of the city's symbols, but is widely interpreted by locals as an eye, which gave the Museum its nickname – \"Museu do Olho\", or Museum of the Eye. In keeping with Curitiba's history and culture of science, the museum offers many science exhibitions, including biennial exhibitions. The Curitiba museum includes the Oscar Niemeyer auditorium.\n\n\nCuritiba has yearly festivals related to arts, such as Curitiba Theatre Festival and the Music Workshop of Curitiba. Others celebrate immigrants festivals, such as the Grape Feast (\"Festa da Uva\"), which is related to Italian immigrants, and the four Matsuri, related to Japanese immigrants.\n\nThe four Matsuri set in Curitiba are: Imin Matsuri (Japanese: 移民祭り, \"Immigration Festival\") which celebrates the arrival of Japanese immigrants in Brazil, Haru Matsuri (Japanese: 春祭り, \"Spring Festival\") which celebrates the end of winter and coming of spring, Hana Matsuri (Japanese: 花祭り, \"Flower Festival\"), which celebrates the birth of Sakyamuni, and Seto Matsuri (\"Seto Festival\"), in honor of Cláudio Seto, comic artist, precursor of the manga in Brazil and idealist of the first Matsuri in Curitiba.\n\nCuritiba also hold the famous Psycho Carnival, a three-day festival that happens during the Brazilian Carnival, but devoted to psychobilly and rockabilly genres, attracting people from all over the world. In the same occasion the Zombie Walk also happens. The 2016 edition took more than 20.000 people to the streets.\n\nOn 20–31 March 2006 the Convention on biodiversity took place in Pinhais (a city near Curitiba), addressing items of the 1993 Convention on Biological Diversity adopted by 188 countries.\n\nCuritiba's public transportation consists entirely of buses. It opened the world's first bus rapid transit (BRT) system, Rede Integrada de Transporte, in 1974. The popularity of Curitiba's BRT has effected a modal shift from automobile travel to bus travel. Based on 1991 traveler survey results, it was estimated that the introduction of the BRT had caused a reduction of about 27 million auto trips per year, annually saving about 27 million liters of fuel. In particular, 28 percent of BRT riders previously traveled by car. Compared to eight other Brazilian cities of its size, Curitiba uses about 30 percent less fuel per capita, resulting in one of the country's lowest rates of ambient air pollution. Some 1,100 buses make 12,500 trips every day, serving more than 1.3 million passengers, 50 times the number from 20 years ago. Eighty percent of travelers use the express or direct bus services. Curitibanos spend only about 10 percent of their income on travel, much below the national average.\n\nThe city government has been planning to introduce an underground metro for a number of years and in 2014 announced opened tenders for a 35-year public private partnership contract to build and operate a , 14-station north-south line. The cost is estimated at 4.62 billion reais.\n\nMoving around in a car can be difficult in and around the city centre because of the many one-way streets and frequent traffic jams. The Trinary Road System allows quick access to the city centre for drivers. Some avenues are spacious and laid out in a grid. Apart from some points around the city centre, Munhoz da Rocha Street and Batel Avenue, traffic jams are not severe.\n\nAfonso Pena International Airport is Curitiba's main airport. It is located in the nearby city of São José dos Pinhais. All commercial flights operate from this airport.\n\nThere is also the Bacacheri Airport, a smaller general aviation facility.\n\nBrazil's transportation and railway company, Rumo, has its headquarters in Curitiba. Serra Verde Express provides a tourist train through scenic country to Morretes and Paranaguá.\n\nThe city has of bike routes, used by around 30 thousand bikers daily. City streets carry almost one million vehicles, of which 2,253 are orange Taxis. To service these vehicles, more than 355 petrol stations serve the city.\n\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Curitiba, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 72 min. 21% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 17 min, while 33% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 7 km, while 12% travel for over 12 km in a single direction.\n\nSeveral association football teams play in Curitiba, Coritiba plays at Estádio Major Antônio Couto Pereira, Clube Atlético Paranaense at Estádio Joaquim Américo Guimarães. Both Coritiba and Atlético Paranaense have won Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, in 1985 and 2001, respectively. Estádio Joaquim Américo Guimarães was one of the 12 stadiums to host games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup held in Brazil. The stadium Vila Capanema have hosted the 1950 FIFA World Cup which still is home to Paraná Clube.\nClube Atlético Paranaense (Brazilian champion of 2001). Arena da Baixada is one of the three privately owned stadiums of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. The other two are Beira-Rio stadium, in Porto Alegre and Arena Itaquera, in São Paulo. Arena da Baixada is considered one of the most modern stadiums in Brazil. This is the lowest budget of all venues of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Most of the original stadium was preserved, and just an expansion is planned; today's capacity is 25,000, which should be increasead to about 42,000.\n\nThe Autódromo Internacional de Curitiba (Curitiba International Raceway) is located in nearby Pinhais.\n\nCuritiba has also one of the main rugby union clubs in Brazil, Curitiba Rugby Clube, national champions in 2014.\n\n\"Bairros\" (neighborhoods) of Curitiba define the city's geographical divisions. Administrative powers are not delegated to neighborhoods, although neighborhood associations work to improve their communities.\nCuritiba is divided into 9 regional governments (boroughs) covering the 75 neighborhoods.\n\nMost districts of Curitiba were born of colonial groups formed by families of European immigrants in the second half of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe centro (downtown or central business district), was where the city was founded, is the most bustling area, which concentrates most of the financial institutions of Curitiba.\n\nCuritiba is twinned with:\nIn addition Curitiba has cooperation agreements with:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The term is also used as the initialism FEPOW (spelled out when said, not pronounced as a word), or as the abbreviation Far East POWs.\n\nIts adoption by various independent voluntary organisations providing support to this specific community of former POWs is an implicit indictment of the perceived lack of UK government support for this community, criticism partly deflected by a UK government compensation scheme introduced in 2000.\n\nSince 2000, following a campaign led by the Royal British Legion, former Far East POWs are eligible for UK Government compensation for their suffering in POW and internment camps operated by the Japanese during the War.\n\nCompensation may be payable to any member of all British Groups imprisoned by the Japanese in the Second World War. It is therefore available to British civilians and merchant seamen as well as members of British and Commonwealth forces. An amendment of the scheme in 2002 extended compensation to former Gurkha soldiers.\n\nAn application may be made by either a former POW or their family or estate. A successful FEPOW applicant is entitled to an \"ex gratia\" payment of £10,000. The scheme is currently administered by the Veterans Agency.\n\nThe National Federation of Far East Prisoner of War Clubs and Associations (NFFCA) acts as an umbrella organisation for over 60 autonomous FEPOW Clubs and Associations in the UK.\n\nThe FEPOW Community has been set up to research loved ones who suffered under Japanese captivity during World War II. It does incorporate a free group, with its members helping each other in research. The Roll-of-Honour (Roll of Honour) has every death of service personnel and civilians mentioned in the site, most having a page of their own. The Far Eastern Heroes (Far Eastern Heroes) covers stories from the FEPOWs themselves, with a special page which promotes FEPOW Day as 15 August, the day Japan surrendered.\n\nChildren and Families of the Far East Prisoners of War (COFEPOW) was founded in 1997 by Carol Cooper in Norfolk after a chance reading of a newspaper article about the discovery of a diary of a soldier who had died working on the Burma Railway. It emerged that the soldier was her father. In 1999 it became a registered charity. Today it comprises a membership of children and siblings of those who died as POWs and campaigns to raise awareness, raises funds for the creation of memorials both in the UK and the Far East, and offers resources for research.\n\nIn 2005, it established the Far East Prisoners of War Memorial Building at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, England. Within the building an exhibition tells the story of those captured by the Japanese during the Second World War. In the same area of the Arboretum are memorials for those prisoners of war who suffered and died building the Burma and Sumatra Railways.\n\nSee Inside and explore the Museum here\n\nLife in the POW camps was recorded at great risk to themselves by artists such as Jack Bridger Chalker, Philip Meninsky, Ashley George Old and Ronald Searle. Human hair was often used for brushes, plant juices and blood for paint, and toilet paper as the \"canvas\". Some of their works were used as evidence in the trials of Japanese war criminals.\n\nThe Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine undertook a study of British Far East POW medical art subsequent to a FEPOW oral history.\n\nOur Lady & St Thomas of Canterbury in Wymondham, Norfolk, England was completed in 1952 on the initiative of Father Malcolm Cowin - former Roman Catholic Chaplain to the 2nd Cambridgeshire Regiment and who himself had spent 3½ years in Japanese POW camps. The site and a fund to build the church had been provided by Irish labours and USAAF personnel in the area. While a prisoner he helped construct three chapels in different camps and determined that on his return to the UK he would build a church in memory of those who died in Japanese POW and internment camps.\n\nIt serves as a parish church for the local Roman Catholic community as well as a focal point for the wider FEPOW community. There is a FEPOW shrine and an annual FEPOW memorial service held on the nearest Sunday to 14 May the anniversary of the relief of Rangoon.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4014018", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4014018", "title": "Film Quarterly", "text": "Film Quarterly\n\nFilm Quarterly, a journal devoted to the study of film, television, and visual media, is published by University of California Press. It publishes scholarly analyses of international and Hollywood cinema as well as independent film, including documentary and animation. The journal also revisits film classics; examines television and digital and online media; reports from international film festivals; reviews recent academic publications; and on occasion addresses installations, video games and emergent technologies. It welcomes established scholars as well as emergent voices that bring new perspectives to bear on visual representation as rooted in issues of diversity, race, lived experience, gender, sexuality, and transnational histories. \"Film Quarterly\" brings timely critical and intersectional approaches to criticism and analyses of visual culture. \n\nSince 2013, it has been edited by B. Ruby Rich, with Regina Longo as associate editor. In 2015, \"Film Quarterly\" began to receive funding from the Ford Foundation’s JustFilms initiative to “support the journal’s work in advancing criticism, analysis, and reporting with particular attention to social justice documentary and the interrogation of cinema practices across genres and platforms.”\n\n\"Film Quarterly\" was first published in 1945 as \"Hollywood Quarterly\", was renamed \"The Quarterly of Film, Radio, and Television\" in 1951, and has operated under its current title since 1958.\n\nAccording to former \"Film Quarterly\" editorial board member Brian Henderson, “\"Hollywood Quarterly\" was launched in 1945 as a joint venture of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization and the University of California Press. The association began as a wartime collaboration between educators and media workers in response to social needs occasioned by the war.” Notable members of its first editorial board were playwright and screenwriter John Howard Lawson, psychologist Franklin Fearing, and writer-director Abraham Polonsky.\n\nAfter allegations in a House of Un-American Activities Committee hearing that \"Hollywood Quarterly\" had communist leanings, in 1951, the journal changed its name to \"Quarterly of Film, Radio, and Television\". This name change inaugurated the journal’s clear divorce from the Hollywood industry with which it had partnered for several years. The journal’s turn towards “politically safe” work in the following years led to editorial discord and instability until August Frugé, then-director of UC Press, changed the direction of the journal. Frugé drew inspiration from the European film journals \"Sight and Sound\" and \"Cahiers du cinéma\", noting in his book that, \"there was no American review comparable to these two, intellectual but not academic and devoted to film as art and not as communication. By accident we found ourselves with the means to publish one—if we chose and if we knew how.\"\n\nUnder the editorial guidance and visionary leadership of Ernest Callenbach, the journal rebranded itself to bridge film criticism and scholarship, and was renamed \"Film Quarterly\" in Fall 1958. Its initial advisory board was composed of, among others, film scholar Andries Deinum; Gavin Lambert, a former editor of \"Sight and Sound\" who was then a screenwriter in Hollywood; Albert Johnson, a Bay Area-based film programmer and critic; and Colin Young, who taught film at UCLA and later became the first director of the British National Film and Television School. Ernest Callenbach remained \"Film Quarterly\"’s editor until the Fall 1991 issue; he had overseen the production of 133 issues by the end of his appointment.\n\nAnn Martin, who had worked as an editor at \"American Film\" and \"The New Yorker\", and on various film and video productions, served as the editor of \"Film Quarterly\" during 1991–2006. Rob White, who had edited the British Film Institute’s BFI Classics series, was in charge during 2006–2012. David Sterritt took over as guest editor for volume 66 in 2012–13.\n\nImmediately following its 40th anniversary, the University of California Press published a \"Film Quarterly\" anthology of its groundbreaking essays, co-edited by Brian Henderson and then-editor Ann Martin. Editorial board members Leo Baudry, Ernest Callenbach, Albert Johnson, Marsha Kinder, and Linda Williams all participated in the conceptualization of the volume. In 2002, Ann Martin and Eric Smoodin (who was then the Film, Media, and Philosophy Acquisitions Editor at UC Press) co-edited a volume of highlights from the journal’s \"Hollywood Quarterly (\"1945–1951) years.\n\nIn 2013, film critic and historian B. Ruby Rich took over as editor for the journal. Rich's editorial vision has particularly emphasized work that engages with fresh approaches to film in a shifting digital media environment and a broadened view of cultural and critical approaches for both historical and contemporary work. \"Film Quarterly\" has emphasized the shifting forms and meanings the moving image has taken in the digital age and worked to expand its views of the field and the writers included in its pages. Special dossiers have focused on Joshua Oppenheimer’s ground-breaking \"The Act of Killing\", the cinema of Richard Linklater, the significance of Brazilian documentarian Edouardo Coutinho, and the legacy of Chantal Akerman. Cover stories have focused on such films as Melvin Van Peebles' \"The Watermelon Man\", Louis Massiah's \"The Bombing of Osage Avenue\" and Jill Soloway's \"Transparent.\" \"Film Quarterly\" aims to widens the scope of voices published in its pages, creates a shared discourse for divergent platforms, and broadens the canon beyond traditional auteurism. \n\nFor a brief time in the 1950s, Pauline Kael was considered for the role of editor. She was then a programmer at the Cinema Guild, a repertory movie house in Berkeley, CA. Frugé and Kael did not share the same vision so the position was subsequently offered to Callenbach instead. Beginning in 1961, a regular feature, \"Films of the Quarter,\" appeared in which a group of well-known film critics—Dwight Macdonald, Stanley Kauffmann, Pauline Kael, Jonas Mekas, and Gavin Lambert—discussed what they viewed as the best films of the prior three months. In the Spring 1963 issue, Pauline Kael famously attacked Andrew Sarris’ auteur theory in her landmark article, \"Circles and Squares.\" In the Summer 1963 issue, Sarris responded to Kael’s critique with his own article, \"The Auteur Theory and the Perils of Pauline.\"\n\nKael included many of her articles, film reviews, and other material published in \"FQ\" during 1961–65 in her first book, \"I Lost It at the Movies\" (1965).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29176975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29176975", "title": "Fontana Modern Masters", "text": "Fontana Modern Masters\n\nThe Fontana Modern Masters was a series of pocket guides on writers, philosophers, and other thinkers and theorists who shaped the intellectual landscape of the twentieth century. The first five titles were published on 12 January 1970 by Fontana Books, the paperback imprint of William Collins & Co, and the series editor was Frank Kermode who was Professor of Modern English Literature at University College London. The books were very popular with students, who 'bought them by the handful' according to Kermode, and they were instantly recognisable by their eye-catching covers, which featured brightly coloured abstract art and sans-serif typography.\n\nThe Fontana Modern Masters occupy a unique place in publishing history - not for their contents but their covers, which draw on the following developments in twentieth-century art and literature:\n\n\nThe cover concept was the brainchild of Fontana's art director John Constable, who had been experimenting with a cover treatment based on cut-ups of \"The Mud Bath\", a key work of British geometric abstraction by the painter David Bomberg. However, a visit to the Grabowski Gallery in London introduced Constable to the work of Oliver Bevan, a graduate of the Royal College of Art in 1964, whose optical and geometric paintings were influenced by Vasarely's Op Art. On seeing Bevan's work, Constable commissioned him to create the covers for the first ten Fontana Modern Masters, which Bevan painted as rectilinear arrangements of tesselating blocks. Each cover was thus a piece of abstract art, but as an incentive for readers to buy all ten books the covers could be arranged to create a larger, composite artwork. The 'set of ten' books appeared in 1970-71 but overran when \"Joyce\" was published with the same cover as \"Guevara\":\n\n\nA second 'set of ten' featuring a new Bevan cut-up was published in 1971-73 but the inclusion of \"Joyce\" in the first 'set of ten' left this second set one book short:\n\nA third 'set of ten' featuring Bevan's kinetic \"Pyramid\" painting began to appear in 1973-74 but Constable left before the set was complete and his replacement, Mike Dempsey, scrapped the set-of-ten incentive after eight books:\n\nDempsey switched the covers to a white background and commissioned a new artist James Lowe, whose cover art for the next eight books in 1975-76 was based on triangles: \n\nNine more books appeared in 1977-79 with cover art by James Lowe based on squares:\n\nDempsey left Fontana Books in 1979 but continued to oversee the Modern Masters series until a new art director, Patrick Mortimer, was appointed in 1980. Four more books followed under Mortimer with cover art by James Lowe based on circles:\n\nThe cover concept was dropped after this and a new design was used that featured a portrait of the Modern Master as a line drawing or later a tinted photograph, and mixed serif and sans-serif typefaces, upright and italic fonts, block capitals, lowercase letters and faux handwriting. The design was used for reprints and six new titles: \n\nFontana's use of art as book covers went full circle in 2003-05 when the British conceptual artist Jamie Shovlin 'reproduced' the covers of the forty-eight Fontana Modern Masters from \"Camus\" to \"Barthes\" as a series of flawed paintings (the titles are missing and the colours have run) in watercolour and ink on paper, each measuring 28 x 19 cm. However, Shovlin also noticed ten forthcoming titles listed on the books' front endpapers which, for reasons unknown, had not been published:\n\n\nShovlin then set out to paint these 'lost' titles and thus 'complete' the series. To do this he devised a 'Fontana Colour Chart' based on the covers of the published books, and a scoring system that - like his paintings - was deliberately flawed. Given these flaws, and those in Fontana's original series, the absence of any modern masters from the visual arts is notable, since \"Matisse\" was one of four 'forthcoming titles' which Shovlin had apparently overlooked:\n\n\n\"Benjamin\" and \"Matisse\" have since been included in a new series of seventeen large Fontana Modern Masters that Shovlin painted in 2011-12. These use a similar scoring system to his watercolours of 2003-05 and a new 'Acrylic Variations Colour Wheel'. The paintings are acrylic on canvas and each measures 210 x 130 cm:\n\n\n\n"}

See Conversion table for Y chromosome haplogroups for comparison with the nomenclature used in pre-2008 sources.\" \n\nY-chromosomal haplogroups identified among the Serbs from Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are the following:\nThere are also several other uncommon haplogroups with lesser frequencies.\n\nY-chromosomal haplogroups identified among the Serbs from Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina are the following: I2a-P37.2 (with frequencies of 29.20 and 30.90%, respectively), E1b1b1a2-V13 (20.35 and 19.80%), R1a1-M17 (15.93 and 13.60%), R1b1b2-M269 (10.62 and 6.20%), K*-M9 (7.08 and 7.40%), J2b-M102 (4.40 and 6.20%), I1-M253 (5.31 and 2.5%), F*-M89 (4.9%, only in B-H), J2a1b1-M92 (2.70%, only in Serbia), and several other uncommon haplogroups with lesser frequencies.\n\nI2a-P37.2 is the most prevailing haplogroup, accounting for nearly one-third of Serbian Y-chromosomes. Its frequency peaks in Herzegovina (64%), and its variance peaks over a large geographic area covering B-H, Serbia, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Geneticists estimate that I2a-P37.2 originated some 10,000 years before present (ybp) in the Balkans, from where it began to expand to Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe about 7000 ybp. It is the second most predominant Y-chromosomal haplogroup in the overall Slavic gene pool. Slavic migrations to the Balkans in the early Middle Ages contributed to the frequency and variance of I2a-P37.2 in the region.\n\nE1b1b1a2-V13 is the second most prevailing haplogroup, accounting for one-fifth of Serbian Y chromosomes. In Southeast Europe, its frequency peaks at the southeastern edge of the region and its variance peaks in the region's southwest. Although its frequency is very high in Kosovo Albanians (46%) and Macedonian Romani (30%), this phenomenon is of a focal rather than a clinal nature, most likely being a consequence of genetic drift. This haplogroup is also high among Albanians in Macedonia (34%) and Albania (24%), as well as Ethnic Macedonians, and Greeks. It is rare among other Slavs, and moderate frequencies of it are found in southern Italy and Anatolia. E-V13 probably originated in the southern Balkans about 9000 ybp. Its ancestral haplogroup, E1b1b1a-M78, could be of a northeast African origin.\n\nR1a1-M17 accounts for about one-seventh to one-sixth of Serbian Y-chromosomes. Its frequency peaks in Ukraine (54.0%), and its variance peaks in northern Bosnia. It is the most predominant haplogroup in the general Slavic paternal gene pool. The variance of R1a1 in the Balkans might have been enhanced by infiltrations of Indo-European speaking peoples between 2000 and 1000 BC, and by the Slavic migrations to the region in the early Middle Ages. A descendant lineage of R1a1-M17, R1a1a7-M458, which has the highest frequency in Central and Southern Poland.\n\nR1b1b2-M269 is moderately represented among Serbian males (6–10%). It has its frequency peak in Western Europe (90% in Wales), but a high frequency is also found in Central Europe among the West Slavs (Poles, Czechs, Slovaks) and Hungarians as well as in the Caucasus among the Ossetians (43%). It was introduced to Europe by farmers migrating from western Anatolia, probably about 7500 ybp. Serb bearers of this haplogroup are in the same cluster as Central and East European ones, as indicated by the frequency distributions of its sub-haplogroups with respect to total R-M269. The other two clusters comprise, respectively, West Europeans and a group of populations from Greece, Turkey, the Caucasus and the Circum-Uralic region.\n\nJ2b-M102 and J2a1b1-M92 have low frequencies among the Serbs (6–7% combined). Various other lineages of haplogroup J2-M172 are found throughout the Balkans, all with low frequencies. Haplogroup J and all its descendants originated in the Middle East. It is proposed that the Balkan Mesolithic foragers, bearers of I-P37.2 and E-V13, adopted farming from the initial J2 agriculturalists who colonized the region about 7000 to 8000 ybp, transmitting the Neolithic cultural package.\n\nAn analysis of molecular variance based on Y-chromosomal STRs showed that Slavs can be divided into two groups: one encompassing West Slavs (Poles, Czechs, Slovaks), Hungarians, East Slavs (only Ukrainians and Belarusians), Slovenes, and western Croats, and the other encompassing Bulgarians, Ethnic Macedonians, Serbs, Bosniaks, Russians and southern Croats. This distinction could be explained by a genetic contribution of pre-Slavic Balkan populations to the genetic heritage of some South Slavs belonging to the group. Principal component analysis of Y-chromosomal haplogroup frequencies among the three ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks, showed that Serbs and Bosniaks are genetically closer to each other than either of them is to Croats.\n\nA total of 103 Serbian individuals were sampled in 2012, and the majority of Serbian Y-chromosomes (58%) belonged to pre-Neolithic lineages.\n\n\nAccording to Serbian physical anthropologist Živko Mikić, the medieval population of Serbia developed a phenotype that represented a mixture of Slavic and indigenous Balkan Dinaric traits. Mikić argues that the Dinaric traits, such as brachycephaly and a bigger average height, have been since then becoming predominant over the Slavic traits among Serbs.\n\n\n"}

It was first published in four volumes in 1570 in Venice, illustrated with woodcuts after the author's own drawings. It has been reprinted and translated many times, often in single-volume format.\n\nBook I was first published in English in 1663 in a London edition by Godfrey Richards. The first complete English language edition was published in London by the Italian-born architect Giacomo Leoni in 1715-1720.\n\nThe treatise is divided into four books:\n\nThe First book discusses building materials and techniques. It documents five classical orders (Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, composite) in all their parts (bases, columns, architraves, arches, capitals, trabeations), as well as discussing other building elements (vaulted ceilings, floors, doors and windows, fireplaces, roofs and stairs).\n\nThe Second book covers the designs of private urban townhouses and country villas of the 1500s, in and around Venice, almost all designed by Palladio himself. This includes nine palazzi, 22 villas (13 of them completed, another 5 partly completed), and a series of unrealized projects. The plates of completed projects sometimes differ from the buildings as actually constructed.\n\nThe Third book addresses matters of city planning: streets, stone street paving, bridges of both stone and wood, and piazzas, with examples drawn from Roman origins alongside contemporary examples; also basilicas, including the basilica designed by Vitruvius in Fano and the important Basilica Palladiana in Vicenza.\n\nThe Fourth book contains five chapters of general introduction, then 26 chapters, each of which describe the designs of specific Roman temples dating from antiquity, along with one contemporary church design. (The exception is the San Pietro in Montorio, designed by Donato Bramante, consecrated in the year 1500.) Palladio's selections range geographically from Rome, Naples, Spoleto, Assisi, Pola and Nîmes. Illustrations of the temples include careful measurements of existing building elements, together with Palladio's own conjectural interpretations of the temple's facades where only fragments remained, as at the Temple of Trajan.\n\nThe 26 temples discussed in include:\n\n\nPalladio founded an architectural movement which takes its name from him, Palladian architecture. \"I quattro libri dell'architettura\" contains Palladio's own designs celebrating the purity and simplicity of classical architecture. Some of these ideas had gotten no further than the drawing board while others, for example villa plans, had been successfully built. The book's clarity inspired numerous patrons and other architects. Palladian architecture grew in popularity across Europe and, by the end of the 18th century, had extended as far as North America. Thomas Jefferson, President of the United States, was a keen admirer of Palladio and once referred to the book as \"the Bible\". \"The Four Books\" was used to inform his own work as the architect of Monticello and the University of Virginia and also architect William Buckland's at the 1774 Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nPalladio drew inspiration from surviving Roman buildings, Roman authors (especially the architect Vitruvius) and Italian Renaissance architects. However, \"The Four Books of Architecture\" provided systematic rules and plans for buildings which were creative and unique. Palladio's villa style is based on details applied to a structural system built of bricks. He offers two types of general rules in the corpus: design rules (those based on appearance) and construction rules (those based on the logic of villa construction). Here rules of the two types are identified in sets from which subsets of identifiers and rules can be written.\n\nEach of the nine rule-sets contains many sub-identities of components and procedures for physical construction. A rule-set such as “Walls”, that identifies five sub-rules based on wall thickness, only needs construction rules; there is no need for rules based on style. In contrast, rules for “Frames” are based on a geometric style of curves and shape proportions. The results will yield clear identities for a shape grammar composition that can be based on physical construction and visual style.\n\nThese identities are taken from the first book of architecture and a survey of built villas. These are the nine rule-sets that define identity:\n\n\n\n"}

They can be broadly divided into the arabesque, using curving plant-based elements, and the girih, using mostly geometrical forms with straight lines or regular curves. Both of these forms of Islamic art developed from the rich interlacing patterns of the Byzantine Empire and from Coptic art.\n\nEva Baer, in her book \"Islamic Ornament\" (1998), describes the art:\n...the intricate interlacings common in later medieval Islamic art, are already prefigured in Umayyad architecture revetments: in floor mosaics, window grilles, stone and stucco carvings and wall paintings(Khirbat al-Mafjar, Qusayr'Amra, Qasr al-Hayr al-Gharbi etc.), and in the decoration of a whole group of early east Iranian, eighth- to tenth-century metal objects.\n\nOne of the first Western studies of the subject was E. H. Hankin's \"The Drawing of Geometric Patterns in Saracenic Art\", published in \"Memoirs of the Archaeological Society of India\" in 1925. In this essay, Hankin takes the view that the artists who created these designs used a method based on the use of the compass and the straight edge. This view is supported by the majority of contemporary authorities on the subject, such as Keith Critchlow in his book, \"Islamic Patterns: An Analytical and Cosmological Approach\". This explains how ornamented objects as varied in size as a book or a mosque, were treated by artists using the same geometric methods adapted to the size and nature of the object being ornamented.\n\nOn the other hand, Owen Jones describes a method whereby interlace ornament is designed on a foundation of geometric grids, with the same grids re-drawn to the size of the object.\nIn his catalog for the \"Crystal Palace\" exhibition, Jones wrote about the decorative art found in the Alhambra, where much of the decoration consists of interwoven designs, that:\n\nThe grace and refinement of Greek ornament is here surpassed. Possessing, equally with the Greeks, an appreciation of pure form, the Moors exceeded them in variety and imagination. \n\nThe Islamic arabesque is a form of artistic decoration consisting of \"surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils\" or plain lines, often combined with other elements. It usually consists of a single design which can be 'tiled' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired.\n\nGirih (, \"knot\"), also girih sāzī (, \"knot making\") or girih chīnī (), is an Islamic decorative art form used in architecture and handicrafts (book covers, tapestry, small metal objects), consisting of geometric lines that form an interlaced strapwork. In Iranian architecture, \"gereh sazi\" patterns were seen in banna'i brickwork, stucco, and mosaic faience work. Girih has been defined as \"geometric (often star-and-polygon) designs composed upon or generated from arrays of points from which construction lines radiate and at which they intersect.\n\n\n\n"}

On graduating from high school, he spent six months working on a kibbutz, where he met his future wife. He studied Arabic at university, and received his B.A. from Princeton University in 1970. He spent the summer of 1969 studying Arabic at the American University in Cairo. Intending to move to Israel permanently, he joined other members of Hashomer Hatzair in living and working at Kibbutz Lahav. There, on encountering attitudes that struck him as being contemptuous of Palestinians, he gradually became disenchanted with his early ideals. He returned to the United States in 1973, and took his M.A. from Harvard University in 1974, and, after working in auto plants in Detroit, obtained his A.M.L.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1978 and 1982, respectively. He has also studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\n\nBeinin's research and writing focuses on workers, peasants, and minorities in the modern Middle East. Though initially interested in the rise of an Arab Working class in Mandatory Palestine, under his thesis supervisor's advice, he changed the topic of his doctoral thesis to a history of the Egyptian labor movement since 1936. That Ph.D. thesis was combined with one covering an earlier period of Egyptian labor history by his friend and colleague Zachary Lockman and resulted in the publication of \"Workers on the Nile: Nationalism, Communism, Islam and the Egyptian Working Class, 1882–1954\" (1989). Among his later work is a study of the Jewish communities of modern Egypt which led to his major historical study, \"The Dispersion Of Egyptian Jewry: Culture, Politics, And The Formation Of A Modern Diaspora\" (1998), which examines the diversity of Egyptian Jewish identities in Egypt and in the diaspora. He has engaged in fieldwork to collect oral reports among many Egyptian Jewish communities dispersed throughout the world after the Suez War of 1956, among them the Karaites of San Francisco.\n\nIn 2002 he served as President of the Middle East Studies Association of North America. He served as Director of Graduate Studies in the History Department at Stanford University in 2002–2004 and again in 2005–06, but then took a leave of absence from that institution in order to take up a position as Director of Middle East Studies at the American University in Cairo. At the time he said that Stanford was institutionally uninterested in the study and teaching of the modern Middle East.\n\nBeinin has written four books and co-edited three others and published many scholarly articles.\n\nHe is also active as a commentator on issues regarding Israel, Palestine, and the Arab–Israeli conflict. He has been a contributing editor to \"Middle East Report\" and has published articles in, among others, \"The Nation\" and \"Le Monde diplomatique\".\n\nIn 2006 Beinin sued conservative writer David Horowitz for copyright infringement after Horowitz used Beinin's image on the cover of a booklet entitled \"Campus Support for Terrorism.\" In 2008, the case ended in an out of court settlement in which Horowitz donated $27,500 to charity but admitted no liability.\n\n\n\"Anti-Semitism: The Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia,\" \"Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern World\" (forthcoming).\n\n\"Knowing the 'Other': Arabs, Islam, and the West,\" in \"Doing Race: 21 Essays for the 21st Century\", Hazel Rose Markus and Paula M.

The paper can itself be shaped to create the desired effects in the final image. Many of László Moholy-Nagy's photograms were luminograms. The image is created by variations in light shape and intensity. They can be created using a small light source, as from a flashlight, that is moved to expose the photosensitive substrate. Moholy-Nagy used this technique to create many of his photograms.\nGottfried Jäger (photographic theorist) describes this as \"the result of pure light design; the rudimentary expression of an interaction of light and photosensitive material… a kind of self representation of light.\"\n\nLászló Moholy-Nagy (1895-1946), American, born in Austria-Hungary (in Bacsborsod). Moved to Vienna in late 1919 after serving in the Austro-Hungarian army.\nIn 1919 he and his wife Lucia Moholy began experimenting with the process of making photograms, and Lucia Moholy (Czechoslovakia) developed a technique they called the photogram.\n\nMoholy-Nagy produced photogram and luminogram images from 1922 in Berlin continuously until his death in 1946. \nChronologically they can be considered from three groups of images: \nBerlin Bauhaus period (1923-1928), \nhis period of exile in London (1935-1937), \nand the United States (1937-1946). .\nMoholy-Nagy considered the \"mysteries\" of the light effects and the analysis of space as experienced through the photogram to be important principles that he experimentally explored and advanced in his teaching throughout his life. [László Moholy-Nagy, Vision in Motion (1947)]. \nMoholy-Nagy's luminograms are completely about light and design. Moholy-Nagy approached the light sensitive photographic paper as a blank canvas and used light to literally paint on the surface with and without the interference of an intervening object.

Born Hertfordshire, UK, Lives & works in Cornwall, UK. Graduated University College Falmouth (with Distinction) MA: Photographic Critical Practice, 2004. Bradford creates Colour Luminograms, sometimes referred to as Lumigrams. Works in private studio darkroom, exhibits regularly. Bradford originated as a member of the \"Seeing The Light\" stable of photographic artists, including Jonathan Shaw, in the early 2000s, under the wing of \"Seeing the Light\" company director, Rhonda Wilson MBE.\n\nBradfords work and that of Martina Corry grow out of spontaneity of hand and arm movement, paradoxically disciplined by an imposed compositional order. Masks are placed where the light should not reach and make its mark, during each distinct exposure period. It is in the distance from the surface and the speed and direction of the movement that the work is allowed to be spontaneous. Debate surrounds the fact that some of the works by all of these artist could be classed as cliché verre - a contemporary re-visioning of an older process, the technique was popular in the 1850s with such French artists as Camille Corot, Jean-François Millet, Théodore Rousseau, and Eugène Delacroix. The most prominent 20th-century exponent of cliché-verre was the Hungarian-American designer György Kepes, and the technique was also explored by Joan Fontcuberta in his \"Frottogram\" series.\n\nMartina Corry is a visual artist, living and working in Ireland, within the field of photography, she graduated from the University of Ulster in 1999 with an MFA (with Distinction) specialising in photography. She creates black and white luminograms often presented on aluminium, which have been exhibited in Ireland. These black and white works are more akin to the earlier works of Moholy-Nagy than the more contemporary colour work of Bradford and Rob and Nick Carter\n\nRob and Nick Carter's luminogram work are in the medium of Cibachrome, the Carters have spent a decade of experimenting with the photogram, on the border of painting and photography. The colour modulations are orientated around blue, green, orange and purple and developed out of the artists' fascination with the orange/blue complementarity of Goethe's colour circle.\n\nJon Lybrook of Colorado, USA has been making luminograms since the early 1990s. Inspired by the work of avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage, Jon Lybrook's Lytescapes Series of luminograms combine painting and photography, employing ortho-chromatic graphics art film, custom photo chemicals, and a variety of masking techniques.\n\nMike Jackson (born 1966) is a British experimental and fine art photographer based in North Dorset, England. He moved away from working with traditional camera techniques in 2015 and is currently progressing the Luminogram process into new directions in which he has become regarded as a leading practitioner.\nPast awards and accolades include being named a Finalist for the Hasselblad Masters Award (2008, 2009, 2010) and winner of the 2013 Chris Beetles Award.\nHis work has been exhibited internationally and is part of various private collections. His work with the Luminogram process is based around the concept of 'sculpting light' for photographic paper to 'translate' into form. He has been quoted as saying that the Luminogram process allows him to use nature as a reference rather than as a subject from which to copy.\n\n"}
{"id": "15908352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15908352", "title": "Manyikeni", "text": "Manyikeni\n\nManyikeni is a Mozambican archaeological site, around 52 km west of the coastal city of Vilanculos. The archaeological site dates from the twelfth to seventeenth century. It is believed to be part of the Great Zimbabwe tradition of architecture, distinguished by mortarless stone walls, and part of the famous Mwenu Mutapa’s Kingdom. The central stone enclosure complex is built in this tradition, and the find of a Zimbabwe-style iron gong at the site also suggests cultural ties.\n\nThe site today is covered by the \"Cenchrus ciliaris\" grass, commonly found in Zimbabwe but not in Mozambique. Berger suggests that this may indicate the grass was introduced along with cattle from Zimbabwe. The site is located 350 km from Great Zimbabwe, the capital of a large, pre-colonial empire active from at least the 11th through the 14th centuries. Barker (1978) has suggested that only the ruling elite at Manyikeni consumed beef, as cattle bones have been found only in the central part of the site. The lower classes who lived at the periphery of the site ate meat from ovi-caprines. The presence of a large number of glass beads and seashells at the site have led to speculation that the settlement traded extensively with the ancient coastal settlement of Chibuene.\n\nManyikeni can be reached from Vilanculos by driving to the EN1 and then travelling south for 30 km. At the small town of Mapinhane, turn right and drive west for 29 km. A small sign shows the entrance to a small track that leads for 3 km before reaching the ruins.\n\nThe site is located on the eastern coastal plains of the Indian Ocean and one of the only Zimbabwean tradition stone enclosures relatively near the coast, emphasizing the site’s role as a coastal trade location. Most importantly, the site appears to have had an important trade relationship with the site located 50 km away, Chibuene, an important Indian Ocean trade network site in the late first millennium AD to the 1700s AD. Occupation of the site begins at about 1200 AD and lasting until 1700 AD. This occupation period is typically broken up into three periods: 1200 AD in which the stone enclosure was being built; 1200-1450 AD in which consists of the height of occupation; and to 1700 AD in which the site was abandoned. The stone enclosure was excavated for the first time in 1975 and 1976, shortly after Mozambique independence by the Eduardo Mondlande University Centre for African Studies and the British Institute in Eastern Africa to 1978. The research in this period determined that the site was a later Iron Age farming community of the Great Zimbabwean tradition, potentially used as a trade outpost with Chibuene.\n\nThe most distinguishing feature of the site is the stone enclosure reflecting that of the Great Zimbabwe tradition. This enclosure measures 20 meters in diameter with a height of 50 cm, making it much smaller in size than the enclosure of Great Zimbabwe. The stone enclosure was constructed without mortar in a similar fashion to Great Zimbabwe, further emphasizing its association with this tradition. Construction was undertaken with the use of limestone, differing from other Great Zimbabwe associated sites that used granite. This was due to the higher availability of limestone in the surrounding region which follows the pattern of other periphery sites of the Great Zimbabwe tradition that utilized resources from the surrounding region, rather than importation of granite for the construction of the stone enclosures. Great Zimbabwe stone enclosure construction was affected by the given location of the site with the availability of stone determining the size of the stone enclosure of the particular site. Granite was the most malleable construction material used by the Great Zimbabwe tradition, but as for limestone at Manyikeni, this material was much more difficult to shape into building blocks. As a result, the use of limestone was partly responsible for the much smaller size of the stone enclosure at the site.\n\nThis site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on September 15, 1997 in the cultural category.\n\n"}

Bush, \"for bringing the world of ideas to millions of listeners.\"\n\nIn 1988 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) presented Rosenberg the \"Responsibility in Journalism\" Award.\n\nRosenberg, born in New York City, attended Brooklyn College (BA, 1946), the University of Wisconsin (MA, 1948), and the University of Michigan (PhD, 1953). He began his teaching career as an Instructor in Psychology at the University of Michigan (1952–54).\n\nRosenberg was a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Chicago, where he served as the director of the doctoral program in Social and Organizational Psychology. Prior to coming to Chicago in the mid-1960s, he taught at Yale (1954–61), Ohio State University (1961–63), and Dartmouth College (1963–65). For a brief period Rosenberg served on the staff of the Naval War College, and he has lectured at various other universities both in the United States and abroad. He served on the Board of Trustees of Chicago's Shimer College in the late 2000s.\n\nRosenberg wrote many articles in professional journals and political magazines. He also wrote, coauthored, or edited a number of books, including: \"Attitude Organization and Change\"; \"Theories of Cognitive Consistency\"; \"Domestic Sources of Foreign Policy\"; \"Beyond Conflict and Containment: Critical Studies of Military and Foreign Policy\"; and \"Vietnam and the Silent Majority\". One of his areas of study was cognitive dissonance and attitude change, on which he worked closely with Robert P. Abelson, among others.\n\nFrom 1973 until December 20, 2012, he hosted WGN Radio's \"Extension 720,\" a two-hour discussion show with one hour reserved for call-ins. The program, which aired Sunday through Thursday (originally Monday through Friday) from 10 p.m. to midnight (an hour later than formerly), dealt with topics ranging from politics to financial investment to entertainment to religion to foreign policy to literature, and, as Milt says, \"just about everything except pop psychology and poodle-trimming.\"\n\nCalling upon journalists, academics, corporate types and just about any and every profession, Extension 720 provided highly varied nightly shows. Some of the programs heard during 2004 were:\nIs War Dead?, The Iran Enigma, Crazy Horse and the Wars of the Plains, The Rise and Fall of Communism, The Changing Face of Chicago, The Films of Francis Ford Coppola, Stem Cell Research, A Night at the Opera, Bush's War Cabinet, Shakespeare's Tragedies, The Undergraduate Life, Avoiding Con Artists, Nanotechnology, The Language of the Presidency, Great Gospel Music, Contemporary Russia and The Origin and Descent of Man.\n\nPast guests of note include such political figures as Margaret Thatcher, Jimmy Carter, Henry Kissinger, George Stephanopoulos, George Shultz, Cyrus Vance (and many members of the Senate and House of Representatives). Other interesting public figures who have appeared on the program include Colin Powell, Charlton Heston, William Safire, Bill Murray, William Bennett, Richard Posner, Bob Feller, Betty Friedan, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Cynthia Ozick, Norman Mailer, Mary Higgins Clark, Calvin Trillin, P.D. James, Peggy Noonan, David Brinkley, George Will, Stanley Kurtz, Ron Paul, Gerry Spence, Jim Lehrer, Michael Medved, Carl Sagan, and on and on—virtually a cast of thousands of interesting and significant people.\n\nOn September 12, 2001, Neocons Fred & Don Kagan were on Rosenberg's show advocating for a US military invasion of Palestine.\n\nOn December 17, 2012, WGN announced that Rosenberg would retire from his daily show on December 20, 2012. However, although he will no longer be a full-time program host, the station's leaders announced that he would remain a show contributor and have a presence at the station. However, it appears that Rosenberg did not have any continuing relationship with WGN after his forced retirement.\n\nIn May 2013, Rosenberg began an independent podcast entitled \"The Milt Rosenberg Show\". The podcast website featured Rosenberg doing new free interviews and offering old ones for sale.\n\nIn April 2015, Rosenberg returned to radio on WCGO-AM 1590 from Evanston, Illinois, weekday evenings; but in November 2015 WCGO-AM 1590 cancelled Rosenberg's program along with the rest of its afternoon lineup.\n\nRosenberg died in Chicago on January 9, 2018 of complications from pneumonia at the age of 92.\n\n"}

{"id": "652429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=652429", "title": "Oppidum", "text": "Oppidum\n\nAn oppidum (plural oppida) is a large fortified Iron Age settlement. Oppida are associated with the Celtic late La Tène culture, emerging during the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, spread across Europe, stretching from Britain and Iberia in the west to the edge of the Hungarian plain in the east. They continued in use until the Romans began conquering Europe. North of the River Danube, where the population remained independent from Rome, oppida continued to be used into the 1st century AD.\n\n\"Oppidum\" is a Latin word meaning the main settlement in any administrative area of ancient Rome, and applied more generally in Latin to smaller urban settlements than cities, equating to \"town\" in English (bearing in mind that ancient \"cities\" could be very small by modern standards). The word is derived from the earlier Latin \"ob-pedum\", \"enclosed space\", possibly from the Proto-Indo-European \"*pedóm-\", \"occupied space\" or \"footprint\".\n\nIn his \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", Julius Caesar described the larger Celtic Iron Age settlements he encountered in Gaul during the Gallic Wars in 58 to 52 BC as \"oppida\". Although he did not explicitly define what features qualified a settlement to be called an \"oppidum\", the main requirements emerge.\n\nThey were important economic sites, places where goods were produced, stored and traded, and sometimes Roman merchants had settled and the Roman legions could obtain supplies. They were also political centres, the seat of authorities who made decisions that affected large numbers of people, such as the appointment of Vercingetorix as head of the Gallic revolt in 52 BC.\n\nCaesar named 28 oppida. By 2011, only 21 of these had been positively identified by historians and archaeologists: either there was a traceable similarity between the Latin and the modern name of the locality (e.g. Orléans-Cenabum), or excavations had provided the necessary evidence (e.g. Alesia). Most of the places that Caesar called oppida were city-sized fortified settlements. However, Geneva, for example, was referred to as an oppidum, but no fortifications dating to this period have yet been discovered there. Caesar also refers to 20 oppida of the Bituriges and 12 of the Helvetii, twice the number of fortified settlements of these groups known today. That implies that Caesar likely counted some unfortified settlements as oppida. A similar ambiguity is in evidence in writing by the Roman historian Livy, who also used the word for both fortified and unfortified settlements.\n\nIn his work \"Geographia\", Ptolemy listed the coordinates of many Celtic settlements. However, research has shown many of the localisations of Ptolemy to be erroneous, making the identification of any modern location with the names he listed highly uncertain and speculative. An exception to that is the oppidum of \"Brenodurum\" at Bern, which was confirmed by an archaeological discovery.\nIn archaeology and prehistory, the term \"oppida\" now refers to a category of settlement; it was first used in that sense by Paul Reinecke, and in reference to Bibracte, Manching, and Závist. In particular, Dehn suggested defining an oppidum by four criteria: \n\nIn current usage, most definitions of \"oppida\" emphasise the presence of fortifications so they are different from undefended farms or settlements and from urban characteristics, marking them as separate from hill forts. They could be referred to as \"the first cities north of the Alps\". The period of 2nd and 1st centuries BC places them in the period known as La Tène. A notional minimum size of has often been suggested, but that is flexible and fortified sites as small as have been described as oppida. However, the term is not always rigorously used, and it has been used to refer to any hill fort or circular rampart dating from the La Tène period. One of the effects of the inconsistency in definitions is that it is uncertain how many oppida were built.\n\nIn European archaeology, the term 'oppida' is also used more widely to characterize any fortified prehistoric settlement. For example, significantly older hill-top structures like the one at Glauberg (6th or 5th century BC) have been called oppida.\n\nSuch wider use of the term is, for example, common in the Iberian archaeology; in the descriptions of the Castro culture it is commonly used to refer to the settlements going back to the 9th century BC. The Spanish word 'castro', also used in English, means a walled settlement or hill fort, and this word is often used interchangeably with 'oppidum' by archaeologists.\n\nAccording to prehistorian John Collis oppida extend as far east as the Hungarian plain where other settlement types take over. Central Spain has sites similar to oppida, but while they share features such as size and defensive ramparts the interior was arranged differently. Oppida feature a wide variety of internal structures, from continuous rows of dwellings (Bibracte) to more widely spaced individual estates (Manching). Some oppida had internal layouts resembling the \"insulae\" of Roman cities (Variscourt). Little is known, however, about the purpose of any public buildings.\nThe main features of the oppida are the walls and gates, the spacious layout, and usually a commanding view of the surrounding area. The major difference with earlier structures was their much larger size. Earlier hill forts were mostly just a few hectares in area, whilst oppida could encompass several dozen or even hundreds of hectares. They also played a role in displaying the power and wealth of the local inhabitants and as a line of demarcation between the town and the countryside. According to Jane McIntosh, the \"impressive ramparts with elaborate gateways ... were probably as much for show and for controlling the movement of people and goods as for defense\".\n\nSize and construction varied considerably. Typically oppida in Bohemia and Bavaria were much larger than those found in the north and west of France. Typically oppida in Britain are small, but there is a group of large oppida in the south east; though oppida are uncommon in northern Britain, Stanwick stands out as an unusual example as it covers . Dry stone walls supported by a bank of earth, called Kelheim ramparts, were characteristic of oppida in central Europe. To the east, timbers were often used to support the earthen ramparts, called \"Pfostenschlitzmauer\" (post slot wall) or \"Preist-type wall\". In western Europe, especially Gaul, the \"murus gallicus\", a timber frame nailed together, was the dominant form of rampart construction. Dump ramparts, that is earth unsupported by timber, were common in Britain and were later adopted in France. They have been found in particular in the north-west and central regions of France and were combined with wide moats (\"Type Fécamp\"). Oppida can be divided into two broad groups, those around the Mediterranean coast and those further inland. The latter group were larger, more varied, and spaced further apart.\n\nIn Britain the oppidum of \"Camulodunon\" (modern Colchester, built between the 1st century BC and the 1st century AD), tribal capital of the Trinovantes and at times the Catuvellauni, made use of natural defences enhanced with earthworks to protect itself. The site was protected by two rivers on three of its sides, with the River Colne bounding the site to the north and east, and the Roman River forming the southern boundary; the extensive bank and ditch earthworks topped with palisades were constructed to close off the open western gap between these two river valleys. These earthworks are considered the most extensive of their kind in Britain, and together with the two rivers enclosed the high status farmsteads, burial grounds, religious sites, industrial areas, river port and coin mint of the Trinovantes.\n\nPrehistoric Europe saw a growing population. According to Jane McIntosh, in about 5,000 BC during the Neolithic between 2 million and 5 million people lived in Europe; in the late (pre-Roman) Iron Age (2nd and 1st centuries BC) it had an estimated population of around 15 to 30 million. Outside Greece and Italy, which were more densely populated, the vast majority of settlements in the Iron Age were small, with perhaps no more than 50 inhabitants. While hill forts could accommodate up to 1,000 people, oppida in the late Iron Age could reach as large as 10,000 inhabitants.\n\nOppida originated in the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. Most were built on fresh sites, usually on an elevated position. Such a location would have allowed the settlement to dominate nearby trade routes and may also have been important as a symbol of control of the area. For instance at the oppidum of Ulaca in Spain the height of the ramparts is not uniform: those overlooking the valley are considerably higher than those facing towards the mountains in the area. The traditional explanation is that the smaller ramparts were unfinished because the region was invaded by the Romans; however, archaeologist John Collis dismisses this explanation because the inhabitants managed to build a second rampart extending the site by to cover an area of . Instead he believes the role of the ramparts as a status symbol may have been more important than their defensive qualities.\n\nWhile some oppida grew from hill forts, by no means all of them had significant defensive functions. The development of oppida was a milestone in the urbanisation of the continent as they were the first large settlements north of the Alps that could genuinely be described as towns. Caesar pointed out that each tribe of Gaul would have several oppida but that they were not all of equal importance, perhaps implying some form of settlement hierarchy.\n\nOppida continued in use until the Romans began conquering Iron Age Europe. Even in the lands north of the River Danube that remained unconquered by the Romans, oppida were abandoned by the late 1st century AD. In conquered lands, the Romans used the infrastructure of the oppida to administer the empire, and many became full Roman towns. This often involved a change of location from the hilltop into the plain.\n\nBy current country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

As such, \"patois\" can refer to pidgins, creoles, dialects, or vernaculars, but not commonly to jargon or slang, which are vocabulary-based forms of cant.\n\nIn colloquial usage of the term, especially in France, class distinctions are implied by the very meaning of the term, since in French, \"patois\" refers to any sociolect associated with uneducated rural classes, in contrast with the dominant prestige language (Standard French) spoken by the middle and high classes of cities, or as used in literature and formal settings (the 'acrolect').\n\nThe term \"patois\" comes from Old French, \"patois\" \"local or regional dialect\" (earlier \"rough, clumsy, or uncultivated speech\"), possibly from the verb \"patoier\", \"to treat roughly\", from \"pate\" \"paw\", from Old Low Franconian *\"patta\" paw, \"sole of the foot\" + \"-ois\", a pejorative suffix. The language sense may have arisen from the notion of a clumsy or rough manner of speaking.\n\nIn France and other Francophone countries, \"patois\" has been used to describe non-standard French and regional languages such as Picard, Occitan, and Franco-Provençal, since 1643, and Catalan after 1700, when the king Louis XIV banned its use. The word assumes the view of such languages being backward, countrified, and unlettered, thus is considered by speakers of those languages as offensive when used by outsiders. Jean Jaurès said \"one names \"patois\" the language of a defeated nation\".\n\nMany of the vernacular forms of English spoken in the Caribbean are also referred to as \"patois\". It is noted especially in reference to Jamaican Patois from 1934. Jamaican Patois language comprises words of the native languages of the many ethnic and cultural groups within the Caribbean including Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Amerindian, and English along with several African languages. Some islands have creole dialects influenced by their linguistic diversity; French, Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, German, Dutch, Italian, Chinese, Vietnamese, and others. Patois are also spoken in Costa Rica and Caribbean islands such as Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Guyana in South America.\n\nOften these patois are popularly considered 'broken English', or slang, but cases such as Jamaican Patois are classified with more correctness as a creole language; in fact, in the Francophone Caribbean the analogous term for local basilectal languages is \"créole\" (see also Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole). Antillean creole, spoken on several present or formerly French islands of the Lesser Antilles, includes vocabulary and grammar of African and Carib origin, in addition to French. It dialects often contain folk-etymological derivatives of French words, for example \"lavier\" (\"river, stream\") which is a syncopated variant of the standard French phrase \"la rivière\" (\"the river\") but has been identified by folk etymology with \"laver\", \"to wash\"; therefore \"lavier\" is interpreted to mean \"a place to wash\" (since such streams are often used for washing laundry).\n\nOther examples of patois include Trasianka, Sheng, and Tsotsitaal.\nPatois has also been spoken for some Uruguay citizens, generally immigrants located in the south of Uruguay, mainly arriving from Italy and France, coming from Piedmont.\n\nDominican, Grenadian, St. Lucian, Trinidadian and Venezuelan speakers of Antillean Creole call the language \"patois\". It is also named \"Patuá\" in the Paria Peninsula of Venezuela, and spoken since the eighteenth century by self-colonization of French people (from Corsica) and Caribbean people (from Martinique, Saint Thomas, Trinidad, Guadeloupe, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) who moved for cacao production.\n\nMacanese Patois is also known as \"Patuá\", and was originally spoken by the Macanese community of the former Portuguese colony of Macau.\n"}

It may refer specifically to the theory of poetry, although some speakers use the term so broadly as to denote the concept of \"theory\" itself.\n\nThe term \"poetics\" comes from the Greek ποιητικός \"poietikos\" \"pertaining to poetry,\" literally \"creative, productive,\" from ποιητός \"poietos\" \"made,\" verbal adjective of ποιεῖν \"poiein\" \"to make.\"\n\nScholar T. V. F. Brogan identifies three major movements in Western poetics over the past 3,000 years, beginning with the formalist, objectivist Aristotelian tradition (see \"Poetics\"). During the romantic era, poetics tended toward expressionism and emphasized the perceiving subject. The 20th century witnessed a return to the Aristotelian paradigm, followed by trends toward metacriticality, or the establishment of a theory of poetics.\n\nEastern poetics developed primarily with reference to the lyric, as opposed to the mimetic.\n\nPoetics is distinguished from hermeneutics by its focus not on the meaning of a text, but rather its understanding of how a text's different elements come together and produce certain effects on the reader. Most literary criticism combines poetics and hermeneutics in a single analysis; however, one or the other may predominate given the text and the aims of the one doing the reading.\n\n"}

He is known for his work with Cirque du Soleil, first as a performing artist touring extensively with \"Saltimbanco\", and later as the clown act creator and acting consultant for the show as well as for Cirque du Soleil's 2011 production \"Zarkana\". He has also starred in shows at the Berlin Wintergarten and the Circus Roncalli.\n\nBazinet was born René Fiener (his mother's surname) in Bochum, Germany. His father was Willy Dege, a cabaret and variety artist. When he was 14, his mother married a Canadian military police officer, Sgt. Major Bazinet, who adopted him, and the family emigrated to Canada. After completing high school in Montreal, Bazinet studied theatre at John Abbott College in Quebec. One of his teachers there, who had studied with Jacques Lecoq, recognized Bazinet's talent for mime and devised a one-man show for him.\n\nOn his teacher's recommendation he was accepted at the École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq and in 1978 left for Paris. There he was particularly influenced by the master clown Philippe Gaulier. It was through Gaulier that Bazinet made his first appearance in Germany, playing Harlequin in a 1980 Gaulier show at the . Jorge Zulueta and Jacobo Romano, the founders of Grupo Accion Instrumental, saw his Frankfurt performances and offered him a job writing and performing in their theatre productions for Paris, Graz, and the Venice Biennale. When he left the Grupo Accion ensemble in 1982, he reconnected with Philippe Gaulier, who had opened his own school with the actress . Bazinet did further studies in theatrical movement with Pagneux and worked as a street performer in Paris, often in the plaza of the Pompidou Center.\n\nIn a 1984 article on the Pompidou Center street performers for \"The Drama Review\", Kris Palmquist described Bazinet's miming as marked by a strong \"inwardness\" and noted,\nRené puts all his emphasis on the perfection of movement, precise and unusual body placement, and rhythmic timing. If everything goes correctly, his act is hypnotic.\nDuring this period, Bazinet formed what was to be a life-long friendship with David Shiner who also worked as a street mime at the Pompidou. In 1988 Bazinet and Shiner (who by then was based in Munich) produced and performed a two-man show there and then took it on tour through Germany for a year and later to the rest of Europe. The 1980s also saw Bazinet performing mime roles in several operas including Maurice Ohana's \" La Célestine\" (Paris Opera, 1988); Menotti's \"The Medium\" (Opéra de Nantes, 1983); and Stravinsky's \"Renard\" (La Fenice, 1982).\n\nBazinet's association with Cirque du Soleil began in 1992 when he created and performed four roles in their premiere production of \"Saltimbanco\". He remained a cornerstone of the production for its first four years as it toured internationally. \"Variety\"'s critic Christopher Meeks wrote:\nThe funniest act on opening night was when clown Rene Bazinet, performing mime with self-produced sound effects, ensnared a denim-dressed man from the audience to join him. The man warmed to the clown's wordless mime lessons, and they enacted eating bananas, slipping on the peels, and, in inspired shenanigans, a shootout at high noon.\n\nHe went on to provide movement and Feldenkreis training for the performers in Cirque du Soleil's next production \"Quidam\" and was the clown act creator and acting consultant for later productions of \"Saltimbanco\" as well as their 2011 production \"Zarkana\". He also played the leading role of Frac in the 1999 film \"Alegría\" which was based on the Cirque du Soleil show of the same name.\n\nDuring the late 1990s and early 2000s Bazinet performed mainly in Germany where he appeared in circuses such as the Circus Roncalli and Salto Natale and in numerous variety and cabaret shows at Berlin's Wintergarten and elsewhere. In the later years of his career he has been based in Montreal and still performs occasionally. He appeared with his fellow veteran clowns Oleg Popov, Peter Shub, David Shiner and Avner Eisenberg in the revue \"Lachen machen – die Könige der Clowns\" which toured Germany in 2012, but he has switched his primary focus from performing to teaching and directing. In 1999 he wrote \"Le Clown\", an illustrated book on the art of clowning, published by Éditions Logiques and part of the series \"Collection Arts du cirque\".\n\n\n \n"}

Shiera Sanders Hall was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, and first appeared in \"Flash Comics\" #1 (January 1940) as a romantic interest of Hawkman (Carter Hall). Then later as one of DC's earliest super-heroines, she has appeared in many of the company's flagship team-up titles including the Justice Society of America. \n\nCreated by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, Shiera Sanders first appeared in \"Flash Comics\" #1 (January 1940), in the same 12-page story in which Fox and Neville introduced Hawkman. Archaeologist Carter Hall has a dream that he is an ancient Egyptian prince, Khufu, who has a lover, named Shiera in the original story, or Princess Chay-Ara in modern retellings. The next day, Carter meets a woman named Shiera, who looks exactly like the woman in his dream. Carter dons the identity of Hawkman and Shiera becomes Carter's girlfriend. Shiera first appears as Hawkgirl in \"All Star Comics\" #5 (July 1941), in a costume created by Sheldon Moldoff, based on Neville's Hawkman costume. During Hawkman's solo segment of the Justice Society of America story, Shiera dons a spare set of Nth metal wings developed by Hawkman, and masquerades as Hawkman in order to trick some criminals. Shiera continues to wear the costume and wings in later stories, eventually adopting the identity of Hawkgirl.\n\nWith the establishment of DC's multiverse system, the Golden Age Hawkgirl was said to have lived on Earth-Two and the Silver Age Hawkgirl on Earth-One. Although Golden Age Hawkman makes his first Silver Age appearance during the first JLA/JSA teamup in 1963 and continues making appearances during the annual JLA/JSA teamups, Golden Age Hawkgirl does not reappear until 1976, in the revival of the \"All Star Comics\" monthly comic. During the publication gap between the cancellation of Hawkman at the end of the Golden Age and the reintroduction of Earth-Two Hawkman during the Silver Age, Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl are married off-panel. Golden Age Hawkgirl made further appearances as the mother of Silver Scarab in the \"Infinity Inc.\" comic and as Hawkgirl as a member of the All-Star Squadron, a retroactive team of Golden Age heroes active in the 1940s.\n\nFollowing the events of DC's miniseries, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", the histories of Earth-One, Two, Four, S, and X were merged into one single Earth with a consistent past, present, and future. As a result, both the Golden Age and the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl live on the same Earth. Shortly after \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", DC decided that having the Justice Society on the same Earth as all of the other superheroes was redundant and most of the team, including Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl were given a sendoff in the \"Last Days of the Justice Society\" one-shot. The Justice Society were trapped in another dimension, Limbo, where they would battle for all of eternity to prevent Ragnarök from occurring on the Earth.\n\nShiera were resurrected after \"Blackest Night\".\n\nThe reincarnation of the Egyptian princess Chay-Ara, and partner of Carter Hall, the Golden Age Hawkman. Centuries ago, Chay-Ara and her lover Prince Khufu were killed by Hath-Set with a knife forged from Nth metal. The properties of the metal and the strength of the duo's love created a bond between them, causing them to be reborn multiple times throughout the centuries. Some of her incarnations are:\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, Chay-Ara was reborn as Shiera Sanders. She was kidnapped by Dr. Anton Hastor (reincarnation of Hath-Set), but subsequently rescued by Hawkman (her reborn lover Khufu). Shiera became the hero's frequent ally and love interest. Eventually, she was granted a costume of her own and a belt of gravity-defying Nth metal, and joined him at his side as Hawkgirl.\n\nThe Hawks were members of the All-Star Squadron, and while Hawkman was a member of the Justice Society of America, Hawkgirl was not, only assisting the group on occasion. Following the events of DC's miniseries, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Shiera Hall joined the JSA. Eventually, Carter and Shiera married and had one son, Hector Hall, the previous Doctor Fate.\n\nThrough retcon, Carter and Shiera also joined the Justice League of America in the late 1980s, serving as liaisons between that group and the Justice Society.\n\nShiera died when she was merged with Carter and Katar Hol to form a new Hawkman version, a \"hawk god\" creature, during the events of \"\", but was revived during the events of \"Blackest Night\" by the White Lantern ring.\n\nIn the \"DC Bombshells\" continuity set in World War II, Shiera is a technological genius and archaeologist who aids the Bombshells with her lover, Vixen. As Hawkgirl, she uses a jetpack rather than fly with wings, though when Cheetah forces her to build weapons out of ancient technology, she designs one with wings as well as a powerful mace.\n\nShiera grew up in an orphanage in Mexico. From a young age she had a passion for history and ancient cultures, as well as the magnificent structures that they built. She became an archaeologist and her work caught the eye of Hans Garber. He informed her of the Zambesi Amulets and the power that they possessed.\n\nIntrigued, Shiera goes to Zambesi to try to discover the secret of the amulets. There she met Queen Mari of Zambesi and the two of them fell in love. Shiera stayed in Zambesi with Mari and became her personal mechanic, building gadgets to assist Mari against her enemies.\n\nHawkgirl discovers her true Thanagarian origins while fighting against Baroness Paula von Gunther. After connecting herself with an ancient mechanic god it's revealed to Shiera that her parents were members of the Wingmen of Thanagar, they sought to warn the humans upon the intentions of Thanagar who wished to conquer the Earth; due to their actions they were captured and murdered.\n\nIn the comic book adaptation of \"\", Hawkgirl (Shiera Hall) appears as a member of Superman's Regime. She first appears to answer Wonder Woman's call for heroes at the Watchtower. After being informed of the situation, the kidnapping of Superman's parents at the hands of Mirror Master, she is one of the many heroes to agree to help locate the Rogue. She battles Weather Wizard in Central City, and is later seen waiting outside the villain's bar. Hawkgirl next appears to help Wonder Woman battle the attacking Atlanteans and Aquaman. Hawkgirl battles the forces of Atlantis as Wonder Woman orders her to rescue the people who had been knocked off the boat by Aquaman's attack. She watches Arthur's forces suddenly retreat and notices the massive tsunami fast approaching. She is the first to realize there is something behind the wave. Hawkgirl spots what she believes are mountains rising out of the water, but are in fact the massive tentacles of the Kraken Aquaman called to his aid. Hawkgirl is ensnared by one of the Kraken's tentacles and dragged underwater, slowly drowning while Wonder Woman struggles to save her. After Superman arrives and forces Aquaman to call his beast off, Hawkgirl is ordered by the Man of Steel to help the sailors while Superman and the League go to give their response to Aquaman's ultimatum. Hawkgirl removes the leader of a country from his limousine during a parade before she loses him to Captain Atom. Shocked, Shiera lets her guard down and is struck by a blast of electricity, causing her to fall to the streets below. Collapsed, Hawkgirl sees Black Lightning and Huntress before the latter knocks her unconscious with an arrow bolt. Hawkgirl is later seen being held in a cell in the Batcave, glaring at Batman and Catwoman as they discuss the League's reaction to her kidnapping. When Catwoman points out the League will be searching for her, Batman disagrees and the scene cuts to the Watchtower, where to many heroes shock, a second Hawkgirl is seen arriving. The true Hawkgirl has remained trapped within the Batcave while her imposter has been revealed as the Martian Manhunter, shape-shifted into her form. Exactly a week later, the Martian Manhunter is exposed thanks to Batman's son Damian, and Bruce releases Hawkgirl as promised. Shiera makes her way to the crashed Watchtower and confirms her identity by easily putting out a lit match.\n\nHawkgirl goes to the Hall of Justice to question Lex Luthor over whether Sinestro truly willingly gave up his ring and powers before allowing himself to be imprisoned. Luthor confirms her questions before saying he still believes Sinestro has something else to play before Sinestro responds that the Green Lanterns will soon arrive to capture Superman and that the League will need his help to stop them.Hawkgirl is next seen waiting for Superman and Shazam in Utah at the Great Salt desert, mace at the ready as she answers Shazam's question of what the Man of Steel thinks they're dealing with by replying \"He thinks we're dealing with Green Lanterns.\" When Superman asks how she knows, she tells him she was talking with their 'guest' at the Hall of Justice. When she sees Superman staring up into the sky, she asks how many Lanterns are on the way, with Superman replying, \"Too many.\"\nAfter the Green Lanterns arrive in front of them and Superman and Kilowog have a brief conversation, Shiera demands to know where Hal Jordan is, and when Kilowog doesn't respond, Superman has Cyborg fire a beam down on the Green Lanterns from the Watchtower.\nThe Green Lanterns survive and engage the three, with Hawkgirl fighting the Green Lanterns Isamot Kol and RRU-9-2, when she sees Superman suddenly go down, calling out his name. Shortly after, Hawkgirl is defeated, her Nth Metal mace taken by Green Lantern Tomar-Re, and her unconscious body trapped in a bubble construct alongside Shazam. Before any of them can be taken to Oa, Sinestro arrives, killing Ch'p. Shiera is freed and recovers her mace before engaging Tomar-Re and Procanon Kaa in a battle until the arrival of the Sinestro Corps. Hawkgirl flies above the captured Green Lanterns, silently observing as they remove their rings in surrender and she witnesses the Sinestro Corps depart the Earth on Sinestro's orders. During the lost seven months, Hawkgirl worked alongside fellow League members Superman and Shazam as well as Lanterns Hal, John and Sinestro in toppling more 'rogue nations' to continue establishing peace across the world.\n\nWhen Hawkman returns to Thanagar and does not find Hawkgirl he goes to Earth. There he tries to force Hawkgirl to leave Superman's Regime and return home, but, loyal to Superman, Shiera fights against Hawkman; after defeating him she asks him to leave or she will kill him. Not respecting her wish, Hawkman later returns to Earth and tries to kill Superman with a kryptonite mace; he fails and is killed in a fist fight against Superman.\n\nHawkgirl appears as Shiera Hall in the continuation series to \"DC Comics Bombshells\", \"Bombshells: United\" set in the United States in 1943. Shiera is shown in Zambesi alongside her lover, Vixen. Hawkgirl is later featured fighting against the Apokolips invasion on Earth.\n\nIn the \"Smallville\" episode, \"Absolute Justice\", Hawkgirl's weaponry and mask are on display at the JSA brownstone. Her hawk helmet has a crack across the right side, and Hawkman notes that she has been dead for several years. He confirms that she is his wife, Shayera Hall, and that both have been reincarnated many times through the ages. She is later featured in the second episode of the show's tenth and final season, entitled \"Shield\". She appears in a brief flashback cameo while Carter Hall tells Lois Lane about their past lives as Prince Khufu and Chay-Ara. She is portrayed by Sahar Biniaz. In the episode \"Icarus\", Carter Hall is killed while saving Lois from General Slade Wilson and a gas explosion in Oliver Queen's office at the LuthorCorp building. Members of the show's nascent Justice League lay Carter to rest in an Egyptian tomb alongside the body of Shayera. As with Carter's, Shayera's helmet and mace are placed on top of her casket in honor and respect.\n\nHawkgirl is a playable character in \"\", voiced by Jennifer Hale. She is seen with the rest of the Justice League battling villains on the \"Prime\" Earth. On the alternate Regime dominated Earth she is a member of the Regime. She and her world's Nightwing attack the \"Prime\" Joker and the rest of the Joker Clan and is defeated. She later battles and is beaten by her world's Lex Luthor, who takes her Nth metal belt as part of his plan to defeat Superman. After the Regime is defeated, she is captured and imprisoned along with the other former heroes. In her single-player ending, Hawkgirl is revealed to have been brainwashed by the Regime. Freed, she defeats Superman for having killed her husband Hawkman, but is imprisoned for her role in the Regime. One night, she is teleported to a stone of pure Nth Metal which encases her in invincible armor. She then sets out to exact revenge on those who helped Superman capture Hawkman.\n"}

The king and the former dictator fled the country when the republic was declared.\nThe new government inherited a bankrupt state. \nIn an atmosphere of political unrest, opinions polarized between the extreme right and extreme left, often degenerating into violence.\nOn the right, the traditionalist Carlist movement revived.\nIn 1933, the aristocratic José Antonio Primo de Rivera, son of the former dictator, founded the far-right Falange movement, similar to the Italian Fascists.\nIn February 1934 the Falange merged with the \"Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista\" (J.O.N.S), another right-wing group.\nLeft-wing trade unions staged industry-wide or citywide strikes, and in Catalonia Marxist and Anarchist groups competed for power. \nLandless laborers seized land, occupied estates and burned churches.\n\nAt a time of political crisis, on 17 July 1936, General Francisco Franco led the Spanish colonial army from Morocco to attack the mainland, starting the Spanish Civil War.\nA bitter war of attrition, in which over 500,000 people died, dragged out until 1 April 1939, when the Nationalists led by Franco had acquired full control of the country.\nFranco was supported by the Falange and the Carlist \"Comunión Tradicionalista\", and united the two parties to forming the \"Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS\", or \"FET y de las JONS\", whose official ideology was the Falangists' 27 puntos. \nThe new party was a wide-ranging nationalist coalition, closely controlled by Franco.\n\nFranco had received material support in the civil war from both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, rulers of Germany and Italy, but when World War II broke out in September 1939, he cited the exhausted state of his country in maintaining a position of neutrality.\nIn June 1940, Spain changed to a position of non-belligerency.\nDespite pressure from Axis diplomats, that is as far as Franco would go.\nAfter the war ended in 1945, Franco remained dictator of Spain, at first isolated among the democracies of post-war Western Europe.\nThis isolation was gradually eroded by the pressures of the Cold War, with Spain signing a security treaty with the United States in 1953.\nIn the 1960s Spain experienced a boom from a growing tourism industry and from relaxation of trade barriers, \nmodernizing economically and then culturally, which placed pressure on the state's highly conservative values.\nHowever, Franco held onto power until his death in November 1975.\nSoon after, a transition to democracy began.\nA 1977 amnesty law was passed under which Franco's followers were given immunity for past abuses in return for supporting the transition.\n\nPhotographs taken at the ceremony in October 1933 when the \"Falange Española de las JONS\" was founded do not show anyone wearing a uniform,\nbut a picture of a meeting of the \"Junta Política\" a year later shows some (but not all) members in the official uniform. \nThis consisted of a dark blue shirt with epaulettes and long black trousers. The left pocket of the shirt bore the emblem of the Falange.\nWomen wore the blue shirt and a knee-length black skirt, with a leather belt bearing the Falange emblem on its buckle. \nAt a meeting in the Teatro Calderón in Valladolid in March 1934 the hall was filled with banners and insignia, and many attendees wore the blue shirts, visually displaying what José Antonio Primo de Rivera called the \"spirit of service and of sacrifice, the ascetic and military concept of life.\" \nLater, upper-class women might use Falangist insignia on their clothes as fashion accessories. \nWhen Carmen Primo de Rivera, sister of José Antonio, married in December 1938 she had the yoke and arrows embroidered on her wedding dress. \nAfter José Antonio died, a black tie was added in his memory.\n\nAfter the union with the Carlists, the original Falange uniform became important in identifying genuine Falangists. \nThe red beret had become the symbol of carlism by the 1860s.\nThe new party, commonly known as the Movimiento Nacional, was given a uniform with the Falangist blue shirt, the red Carlist beret and military belts. \nThe party symbol was the Falangist yoke and arrows.\nA portrait of Franco by Ignacio Zuloaga from 1940 shows him wearing the blue shirt, military boots and jodhpurs,\nand the red beret of the requetés.\n\nAt the time of the Pronunciamiento of 17 and 18 July 1936, the insurgent military forces used the national flag with their coat-of arms superimposed, that is to say, the current \"tricolor\" with the 1869 coat of arms, which had been approved by the Spanish Constitution of 1931. However, in the operations, especially in the air and naval combats, the insurgents soon experienced confusion in distinguishing their units from those of the government. Also, within the insurgent heterogenic political families, the Carlists in Navarre insisted on going into combat with flags that were red and gold or white embroidered with red, known as the burgundy of San Andrés, and they included a wide variety of emblems with a mixture of symbols of the monarchy and religion, the latter being particularly directed to the worship of the \"Sacred Heart\".\n\nThe government aimed to resolve this flag situation with the Decree of 29 August 1936, signed by General Miguel Cabanellas, which reinstated the red and yellow flag. \nThere was no reference to the dimensions nor the coat of arms, so the insurgent forces employed a host of distinctive coats of arms. \nTo settle this situation, the Junta added an order to the Decree on 13 September 1936, signed by Colonel Federico Montaner. \nThis defined the shapes and dimensions of the Army's flags to be the same as before the proclamation of the Republic.\nThe coat of arms was that of the Republic. \nEventually, considering the aims of the Falange, a new design for the coat of arms was formally specified and regulated by Decree number 470, 2 February 1938, signed by General Franco.\n\nThe escutcheon, popularly known the \"Eagle escutcheon\", and then representative of the insurgent group and its ideology, was imposed after the conflict as the national escutcheon for Spain. It included some minor technical improvements which were approved in 1945, during the period of the Francoist State itself and also during the period of democratic transition until 1981. Certain symbolic value changes were approved in 1977, such as making the eagle's wings much more open.\n\nBy the express directive of the Franco government, the design of the shield for the national emblem represented a departure from the traditional one that had been used in its various forms since 1868. After this change, the escutcheon of Spain was attached to the State and not the Monarchy. Without affecting the basic design, the shield was divided into four with the coats of arms of Castille, León, Aragon and Navarre, plus the «enté en point» of Granada. The inclusion of other historical heraldic elements gave a clear symbolic significance: \"The set of arrows and the yoke of the Catholic Monarchs, whose adoption as a badge is one of the great successes of our Falange, must appear on the official arms to indicate what should be the tone of the New State.\"\n\nThe Eagle on Franco's escutcheon had already been used on the arms of the Catholic Monarchs. \nIt was the Eagle of Saint John the Evangelist, which Queen Isabella I of Castile used on an evangelist escutcheon to which she added the words \"sub umbra alarum tuarum protege nos\" (protect us under the shadow of your wings).\nThe heraldry used by Franco was similar to that of the Catholic Monarchs, the arms of Aragon-Sicily replaced by those of the Navarre, the addition of the Pillars of Hercules and the motto One, Great and Free\".\n\nIn Spanish heraldic tradition, the yoke, set of arrows and the Gordian Knot, were elements which were joined with the leaves and the pomegranate and the motto \"Tanto monta, monta tanto\" (Equal opposites in balance), the personal motto and prenuptial agreement of the Catholic Monarchs Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, as embodied in the song of Pedro Marcuello.\nThis motto was used upon the weapons of both Monarchs from 1475. \nThey made an agreement, now called \"Concordia de Segovia\" and the coat of arms is a graphic representation of this pact which united the two most important Monarchs on the peninsula. It is the oldest known image of the escutcheon.\n\nThe bundle of arrows may have its origins in the Roman \"fasces\", a bundle of rods and an axe with the blade projecting, that were carried before the magistrates to show their power. The arrows pointed downward to show they were ready for use in executing criminals or for warfare.\nWith the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella, the bundle of arrows meant the union of Castile and Aragon to create Spain. The yoke was Isabel's and the arrows Ferdinand's.\nThe F was the first letter of Fernando's name, and the Y the first letter of Isabella's.\nThe Gordian knot, cut, united the two. \nThe number of arrows varied, but always pointed downwards. Over time, the badge of the Catholic Monarchs spread to other heraldic compositions, and was adopted in some of its variants as the emblems of not only towns and cities such Ronda, Marbella and Málaga, but also Puerto Rico and the Netherlands.\n\nThe adoption of this symbol was explained by a professor at the University of Granada, Fernando de los Ríos, who had socialist leanings. In a class on political law of the Fascist state and its symbols, he made a drawing on the blackboard of a set of arrows linked with a yoke, indicating that this would be the symbol of Fascism and to have been born or raised in Spain. He said that if ever there was a Spanish fascism, this would be the emblem.\"\"\nJuan Aparicio López, a student attending the class, suggested adoption of this symbol for JONS of Onésimo Redondo and Ramiro Ledesma Ramos (Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista). He also proposed the 'red and black' and the motto \"Spain: one, great and free\".\nThe J.O.N.S adopted the yoke and arrows symbol, which immediately became popular due to its geometrical simplicity, warlike symbolism and invocation of a time when Spain was glorious.\nThe symbol was adopted by the Falange at the time of the merger on 13 February 1934.\nThe yoke and arrows represented the union of the five kingdoms of Castile, Leon, Aragon, Granada and Navarre, \nand both national unity and the glories of the period of Ferdinand and Isabella were persistent themes of Franco's Spain.\n\nThe poet and activist Rafael Sánchez Mazas wrote, in an edition of the magazine \"El Fascio\"1933 the reasons for the Spanish Falange's adoption of some aspects of those used by the Catholic Monarchs was because of their origin in the works of the Roman poet Virgil (70 BC – 19 BC). The symbolism of the arrows, as an expression of war was used in Virgil's \"Aeneid\", and the yoke, a symbol for agricultural, was based in Virgil's poem, the Georgics, and was meant to provide a falangist symbolism:\n\"... We integrate the yoke and the set of arrows into the escutcheon. If the yoke without the arrows is heavy, the arrows without the yoke are in danger of becoming too scattered. We are changing, rather than to a policy, to a discipline, to a behavior, to a style, to a way of being, to an education.\"\nThose responsible for the Falange ideology, such as José Antonio Primo de Rivera, Juan Aparicio, Ernesto Giménez Caballero, Ramiro Ledesma, Orbegozo, wrote in the journal \"Fascio\" that the chosen emblem was also close to Italian Fascism.\n\nThe \"victor\" is a symbol from the Ancient Roman Empire.\nAfter the Edict of Milan in the year 313 AD, the \"crismón\" appeared on coins, flags and eventually also became part of the shields of the Roman legionaries. \nAccording to legend, the night before the battle of the Ponte Milvio, the \"crismón\" with the words \"in hoc signo vinces\" (In this sign, you conquer') appeared to Emperor Constantine the Great in his dreams. The next day the Emperor replaced the Imperial eagle by the \"crismón\" on the standard, the \"labarum\", and he won the battle.\nOver time, it was gradually included, in varying forms, on the Roman crowns. It had become the symbol of the victor and the victorious.\nFrom the fourteenth century, it was adopted as the emblem for doctors by some Spanish universities, such as the University of Salamanca and later Alcalá de Henares, and is in mural inscriptions done in red or black paint that remain there today. Finally, it was chosen as suitable for use in the \"Victory Parade\" (July 18, 1939) and, thereafter, throughout the Franco dictatorship, as emblem of Franco.\nMistakenly it was thought it had been designed by Corintio Haza, who incorporated astrological symbols in the emblem to protect the \"Caudillo\".\n\nThe guidon, the personal military flag, and a head of State's standard were created in 1940 and then used until the death of the dictator. The stripe between the two dragons separates the two Pillars of Hercules which have silver columns, gold Corinthian capitals and are headed with crowns. The crown nearest to the stripe, which is always on the column placed on the lower part of the flag, is an Imperial crown with a central upright bar. The one on the other column is a Royal crown, this has a more open top and it is always on the column placed on the top half of the flag.\nThe Royal Bend of Castile, which was a personal badge of the Castilian Monarchs and later used by the House of Habsburg, was used as the basis for the creation of the escutcheon. \nThe standard, the flag which was flown at official residences, barracks and on ships of the Spanish Navy, was a square with the elements mentioned above.\n\"La Banda de Castilla\" and the Columns of Hercules form part of the personal escuteon used by Franco as Chief of State. The coat of arms also contained the Laureate Cross of Saint Ferdinand as supporter and an open crown without arches known as the crown of military leadership.\n\nThe statues are varied sculptural representations of the dictator: busts, equestrian statues, etc., which the state placed in many Spanish cities. The purpose of having so many statues has changed over time. It has been suggested that up to 1959 (and especially in the 1940s) the purpose of the many statues was to legitimize the state and \"perpetuate the memory of victory\". It has been further suggested that in the 1960s these were a special tribute to show \"appreciation of Franco and his achievements\" (in a spirit of commemorating the 25 Years of Peace). In the last period (after the death of Franco until 1978) the statues were to \"secure the memory\" of an \"unchanging goal.\n\nThe most important equestrian statues were placed in prominent places in Valencia, Santander and the \"Nuevos Ministerios\" in Madrid. The original was designed in 1959 by José Capuz Mamano.\nThis statue is at the Complutense University in Madrid, with other copies in Barcelona, Zaragoza (1948), Melilla, Ferrol, and the Institute of Maeztu Ramiro in Madrid (1942, a smaller one than the original and moved to the Infantry Academy in Toledo in the 1980s to the Infantry Academy in Toledo.\n\nPlaces where statues can currently be found:\n\n\nWar memorials and plaques for those \"Fallen for God and Spain\" were placed in many villages, most on the outside of the churches. They contained a list of names of the dead people belonging to the Spanish Nationalist party followed by the declaration 'Present!' similar to that of José Antonio Primo de Rivera. The plaques, although there were many kinds, were usually made of marble and topped with bronze or other metal. Sometimes the plaques were placed on the walls of the church, or if there was a wall nearby, at the burial place of the victims named on the plaque. If there was a cross-shaped monument or low obelisk that recorded the names, a plaque was attached to it. Many places have now chosen to move this type of monument to the cemeteries, and in some cases they have been turned into tributes to the \"fallen\" from both sides.\nThere was another use of plaques, this was at the opening of institutions and infrastructure such as railway lines, stations, reservoirs, etc., These plaques still exist today.\nMany of the plaques and monuments are neither maintained nor withdrawn.\n\nThe Victory Arch of Madrid (\"Arco de la Victoria de Madrid\") is situated in the Moncloa-Aravaca district of Madrid. \nThe monument was built between 1953 and 1956 by order of Franco to commemorate his victory in the Spanish Civil War. \nThe high arch commemorates the nationalist victory in the Battle of Ciudad Universitaria, in which the University City was destroyed. Inscriptions in Latin describe the victory and the construction of the new University City.\nBehind it is the monument to the Fallen from Madrid, designed in 1949 by the architect Manuel Herrero de Palacios, a monumental circular building roofed with a cupola.\nToday it is the home of the municipal council of the Moncloa - Aravaca district.\n\nPopularly known as the Monument to the Fallen, the real name is \"Navarra a sus Muertos en la Cruzada\" (Navarre to its Dead in the Crusade), as indicated on its facade.\nThe building was erected in memory of the dead from Navarre, a Nationalist stronghold during the Civil War, and is located in the heart of the city of Pamplona, the capital of Navarre. The building was designed by the architects Victor Eusa and José Yamoz.\nThe names of the 5,000 people of Navarre who died in combat in the civil war were inscribed on its walls,\nbut today they are covered by a sheet.\nToday the building is known as the \"Sala de Exposiciones Conde Rodezno\" (Conde Rodezno Exhibition Hall) and is used for small municipal exhibitions.\n\nThe Cuartel de la Montaña was a military building in Madrid that achieved notoriety as the place where the military uprising of July 1936 began in the city.\nOn July 19, 1936 in Madrid, General Fanjul, without a commission, but charged with the uprising of the city, came in civilian clothes, to the headquarters, Cuartel de La Montaña. Instead of going out with troops to take the vital points of the capital, he simply proclaimed the state of war and became powerful with 1,500 men (of whom there were about 140 officers) and approximately 180 Falangists from the Cuartel de La Montaña.\n\nThat afternoon, the base was surrounded by poorly armed troops loyal to the government of the Republic Assault Guards, civilians and militia. At dawn on 20 July, shelling of the barracks began. The rebels resisted for only a few hours. Differences of opinion amongst themselves, led some rebels to fly the white flag while others were firing on the attackers. The garrison fell, being almost completely destroyed. The entry of the attacking forces resulted in the murder of most of the officers (ninety of one hundred forty) and the Falangists. There were between 150 and 300 dead.\n\nThe building, which had been mostly destroyed during the siege, during the war suffered the impact of numerous artillery attacks because of its proximity to the front line, which to all intents and purposes stayed in the same place since early 1937. Towards the end of the war it was just a set of ruins, some of which could still be seen in the early sixties.\nThe park, Parque del Cuartel de la Montaña, was inaugurated on 20 July 1972, when Franco was still in power and Carlos Arias Navarro, the future prime minister, was mayor of Madrid. It incorporates a monument, also from 1972, by Joaquín Vaquero Turcios in memory of those who died in its defence. This consists of a bronze figure representing the body of an injured man at the centre of a wall sculpted in the form of sandbags.\n\nThe Battle of Belchite occurred during the Republican offensive in Aragon that started in August 1937, with Zaragoza as the target. For various reasons, including heat, lack of water and the military superiority of the Nationalists, the offensive was unsuccessful. Starting on 1 September 1937, the republicans concentrated on Belchite, with an intense artillery bombardment combined with aerial bombing. The town was totally ruined and 6,000 people had died when the defenders surrendered on 6 September 1937. Although the outcome was a Republican victory, the delay caused by the battle gave the Nationalists time to regroup and prevent the advance to Zaragoza.\n\nFranco decreed that the original town be left in its state of ruin as a monument.\nRepublican prisoners were made to build a new town of Belchite, but the original town has not been rebuilt.\nThe ruins remain as a monument that attracts small numbers of battlefield tourists each year.\n\nThe bloodiest battle of the Civil War was fought on the left bank of the river Ebro.\n\n\nRepublican Militia guards killed over a thousand prisoners in the \"Massacre of Paracuellos\", during the Battle of Madrid, in the area around San Jose, in the municipality of Paracuellos de Jarama, and Soto Aldovea, within the boundary of Torrejón de Ardoz. They are commemorated by a large white cross on the slopes of the Cerro de San Miguel, near the river Jarama and visible from the airport of Madrid-Barajas.\n\nIn the third century the Alcázar of Toledo was a Roman palace. It was restored during the reigns of Alfonso VI and Alfonso X and modified in 1535.\nDuring the Civil War it was used by Colonel José Moscardó Ituarte as a defence building and a place of resistance. During a siege there, which lasted 70 days, from 22 July to 28 September 28, 1936, it was completely destroyed by troops loyal to the Second Spanish Republic. \nLater it was rebuilt.\nSince 1998 it has housed the Library of Castile-La Mancha, and from 2010 it has also held the Army Museum.\nThe siege and liberation were used by Francisco Franco to establish his dominance with his followers.\nThe newspaper \"Ultra\" named the building \"El Alcázar\" of Spain, although at first was a daily that referred to it as an historical landmark.\n\nThe Monument to the cruiser \"Baleares\" (\"El Monumento al Crucero «Baleares»\") is located in the San Feixina Park, Palma, Majorca.\nIt is controversial, with some groups calling for its removal.\nThe monument was erected in memory of the crew of the Spanish cruiser Baleares, which was torpedoed and sunk by destroyers of the Spanish Republican Navy in the Battle of Cape Palos. The monument was designed by the architects Don Francisco and Don José Roca Simó (father and son) and the sculptor José Ortells Cabanellas. It was inaugurated on 16 May 1947. The column is high, topped by a huge cross. At one time it also had a sculpture of a sailor clinging to an anchor.\n\nFranco was raised as a devout Catholic, and came to believe that Spanish nationalism and Catholic belief could not be separated. He felt that Spain had a special religious mission, and completely identified his cause with the cause of the church.\nFranco called his fight against the Republicans a \"crusade\" and presented his 1939 victory as a victory of Christian civilization.\nWhen attending churches, he entered solemnly under a religious canopy.\nOn 15 April 1938, Vinaròs beach was captured, splitting the Republican-held area into two.\nThe head of the Navarre IV Division dipped his fingers in the water and made the sign of the cross, symbolically taking possession.\n\nSt Teresa was designated by traditionalists and the Catholic Church as the \"saint of the Spanish race\". The Nationalist forces found a relic of the saint in Málaga, one of her hands, which was sent to Franco. He made a personal cult of devotion to the saint, keeping the relic in his home until he died.\n\nThis monument to the fallen in the civil war was built by Republican prisoners of war.\nIt is on a huge scale, with the basilica built into the side of a pine-covered mountain, \nwith an enormous stone cross above the entrance. \nThe stone cross is high and is visible from a distance of .\nThe monument and basilica were built in accordance with the Decree of 1 April 1940 providing for construction of a Basilica, monastery and youth headquarters, in a farm located on the slopes of the Sierra de Guadarrama (El Escorial), \"to perpetuate the memory of the fallen of our glorious Crusade\".\nConstruction began in the 1940s and the structure was completed in 1959.\n\nFranco's grave is beside the altar.\nThe monument is still visited by the dwindling group of his die-hard supporters on the anniversary of Franco's death. \nJosé Antonio Primo de Rivera and many other combatants from both sides in the Spanish Civil War are buried in the valley.\nPerhaps 50,000 of Franco's supporters are buried there, along with a handful of Republicans.\nHuman rights groups have called for \"El Valle de los Caidos\" to be converted into a center that would teach visitors about the civil war and the Francoist State.\nOthers have asked that the bodies of Jose Antonio and Franco be removed, \nand that plaques or other methods be used to give visitors some understanding of the historical background.\n\nThe \"Cerro de los Ángeles\" (Hill of the Angels) is the site of the \"Monumento al Sagrado Corazón\" (Monument of the Sacred Heart).\nThe original monument was created by the architect Carlos Maura Nadal and the sculptor Aniceto Marinas y García, and was inaugurated by King Alfonso XIII on 30 May 1919.\nIt was destroyed on 7 August 1936 during the civil war.\nThe Republicans dynamited the monument due to its religious and political symbolism. \nThere was a proposal to replace it with a figure representing Liberty or the Republic, but this was not executed.\n\nThe current monument is similar in design to the 1919 monument, but on a larger scale. \nConstruction began in 1944 to designs by the architects Pedro Muguruza and Luis Quijada Martínez.\nThe monument shows Christ with open arms, inviting all men to come to Him. \nThe high statue on a pedestal is the work of Aniceto Marinas, and the group of sculptures around the base is by Fernando Cruz Solís.\nThe monument was opened in 1965. The crypt, which did not exist in the original monument, was opened in 1975.\n\nToday, there are a dozen towns that preserve the memory of Franco in their official names. The only one which has the status of a municipality is Llanos del Caudillo, with 726 inhabitants. Many other towns and cities that had similar names for decades, such as El Ferrol del Caudillo (until 1982, in the province of La Coruña), or Barbate de Franco (until 1998, in the province of Cadiz), withdrew the reference to Franco after the restoration of democracy. Franco wanted to honour generals from the Nationalist side by putting their names to various locations, and they still retain these. Such is the case of San Leonardo de Yagüe, where General Juan Yagüe was born, or Alcocero de Mola, where General Emilio Mola died in a plane crash during the war.\nThe case of Numancia de la Sagra (Toledo) is an example. Since the Middle Ages this town was known as \"Azaña\", but during the Civil War this coincided with the first name of the then Spanish Prime Minister, Manuel Azaña, so it was replaced in 1936. The original name, Azana means \"wheel\" (Arab-Moorish word). The town is now called \"Numancia\", after the regiment which captured it and \"Sagra\" for the region it belongs to.\n\nThe memory of Franco is still present in the names of the streets, squares and avenues of various towns and cities. There are also streets, avenues and squares in many cities and towns in Spain with names of generals from during the Civil War and the Nationalist party, military commanders such as Mola, Sanjurjo, Moscardó, Yagüe and Millán Astray. Other names from the Franco time were used, such as José Antonio Primo de Rivera, Ramiro Ledesma, Onésimo Redondo, José Calvo Sotelo, etc.. Those that did not have a personal relationship with Franco, were those who had died before or during the war; José Antonio Primo de Rivera, who was imprisoned, opposed the National Uprising and become part of the earlier conspiracy.\n\nIn January 1980 the Madrid city council decided to rename twenty downtown streets, returning them to the names they had before 14 April 1931, when the Second Republic was created. The Avenida del Generalísimo, which had been created since that date, became the Paseo de la Castellana.\nIn 1981 the Avenida de José Antonio in Madrid was renamed \"La Gran Vía\".\nBut despite the withdrawal of some of the symbols during the first years of the Transition, some symbols remained more than thirty years after his death.\n\nThe Spanish Historical Memory Law, approved by the Congress of Deputies on 31 October 2007, mandated the removal of commemorative plaques, statues and other symbols from public buildings. It also opened the public archives covering the period and facilitated the task of locating and exhuming the graves of victims.\nUnder the 2007 law introduced by the socialist government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Falangist symbols had to be removed from public view, and streets and plazas that honored Franco and his entourage had to be renamed.\nThe law was criticized by both left-wing and right-wing observers, for being too lenient or too severe.\nA historian said that by focusing on the abuses committed by Franco the government was presenting the left-wing republican government in too favorable a light, ignoring the many problems of the feuding socialist, anarchist, communist and separatist groups.\n\nIn 2010 the department of National Heritage stopped offering tours of Franco's private quarters in the Royal Palace of El Pardo, although tours of the older parts of the palace with \"high artistic value\" would continue.\nIn December 2010 the \"Valle de los Caidos\" was reopened, but with tight security systems to prevent vandalism or destruction by militant members of victims' associations.\nAs of 2011 the government was considering exhuming Franco's body from the \"Valle de los Caidos\" and reburying it beside his wife in a municipal cemetery. There were some protests, but many supported the plan to transform the site into a place of reconciliation, with plaques to explain the past. Ramón Jáuregui, the responsible minister, said, \"We have dealt with the past little by little. Maybe we're tackling this site a little late, but prudence has been the key to our peaceful transition.\"\n\nThere was much debate regarding symbols that might affect the Church, so an exception was introduced for religious reasons, and an exception made for monuments with particular artistic value. There are some emblematic symbols such as the yoke and arrows on the Casa Sindical (a brick tower facing the Museo del Prado) and the Central Headquarters of the Movimiento, the Alcalá de Madrid which was built in a rationalist style.\n\n\n"}

In 1886, the magazine's headquarters moved from Manchester to London where it paved the way for popular journalism — most significantly, the \"Daily Mail\" was founded by Alfred Harmsworth, a contributor to \"Tit-Bits\", and the \"Daily Express\" was launched by Arthur Pearson, who worked at \"Tit-Bits\" for five years after winning a competition to get a job on the magazine.\n\nFrom the outset, the magazine was a mass-circulation commercial publication on cheap newsprint which soon reached sales of between 400,000 and 600,000. Like a mini-encyclopedia it presented a diverse range of tit-bits of information in an easy-to-read format, with the emphasis on human interest stories concentrating on drama and sensation. It also featured short stories and full-length fiction, including works by authors such as Rider Haggard and Isaac Asimov, plus three very early stories by Christopher Priest.\n\nThe first humorous article by P. G. Wodehouse, \"Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings\", appeared in \"Tit-Bits\" in November 1900. During the first world war Ivor Novello won a \"Titbits\" competition to write a song soldiers could sing at the front: he penned \"Keep the Home Fires Burning\".\n\nPin-ups appeared on the magazine's covers from 1939 and by 1955 circulation peaked at 1,150,000. At the beginning of 1973 \"Tit-Bits\" lost the hyphen from its masthead. In 1979 \"Reveille\" (a weekly tabloid with a virtually identical demographic) was merged into \"Titbits\", and the magazine was briefly rebranded as \"Titbits incorporating Reveille\". This however was dropped in July 1981. On 18 July 1984, under its last editor Paul Hopkins, \"Titbits\" was selling only 170,000 copies and was taken over by Associated Newspapers' \"Weekend\". At the time, the \"Financial Times\" described \"Titbits\" as “the 103-year-old progenitor of Britain's popular press”. \"Weekend\" itself closed in 1989.\n\nIn \"All Things Considered\" by G. K. Chesterton, the author contrasts \"Tit-Bits\" with the \"Times\", saying: \"Let any honest reader... ask himself whether he would really rather be asked in the next two hours to write the front page of \"The Times\", which is full of long leading articles, or the front page of \"Tit-Bits\", which is full of short jokes.\" Reference to the magazine is also made in James Joyce's \"Ulysses\", George Orwell's \"Animal Farm\", James Hilton's \"Lost Horizon\", Virginia Woolf's \"Moments of Being\", H. G. Wells' \"The First Men in the Moon\" and AJ Cronin's \"The Stars Look Down\". It has been also mentioned in Stanley Houghton's play The Dear Departed. Wells also mentioned it in his book \"Experiment in Autobiography\". The magazine is burlesqued as \"Chit Chat\" in George Gissing's \"New Grub Street\". In the closing scene of the film \"Kind Hearts and Coronets\" (1949), the protagonist Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) is approached by a journalist (Arthur Lowe) from \"Tit-Bits\".\n\nThe magazine name survived as a glossy adult monthly \"Titbits International\".\n\n"}

{"id": "193684", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=193684", "title": "Yaxchilan", "text": "Yaxchilan\n\nYaxchilan () is an ancient Maya city located on the bank of the Usumacinta River in the state of Chiapas, Mexico. In the Late Classic Period Yaxchilan was one of the most powerful Maya states along the course of the Usumacinta River, with Piedras Negras as its major rival. Architectural styles in subordinate sites in the Usumacinta region demonstrate clear differences that mark a clear boundary between the two kingdoms.\n\nYaxchilan was a large center, important throughout the Classic era, and the dominant power of the Usumacinta River area. It dominated such smaller sites as Bonampak, and had a long rivalry with Piedras Negras and at least for a time with Tikal; it was a rival of Palenque, with which Yaxchilan warred in 654.\n\nThe site is particularly known for its well-preserved sculptured stone lintels set above the doorways of the main structures. These lintels, together with the stelae erected before the major buildings, contain hieroglyphic texts describing the dynastic history of the city.\n\nEpigraphers think that the ancient name for the city was probably the same as that of its realm, Pa' Chan. , meaning \"Cleft (or broken) Sky\". Early archaeologist Désiré Charnay dubbed the ruins \"Lorillard City\" in honor of Pierre Lorillard who contributed to defray the expense of his expedition into the Maya zone, while Alfred Maudslay named it \"Menché\". Teoberto Maler gave it its modern name, said to mean \"Green Stones\" in an unspecified Maya language. For some time, the Emblem Gylph was read as Siyaj Chan, or \"Sky Born\".\n\nYaxchilan is located on the south bank of the Usumacinta River, at the apex of a horseshoe-shaped meander. This loop defends the site on all sides except for a narrow land approach from the south. The site is upriver from the ruins of Piedras Negras, its major rival. Yaxchilan is from the ruins of Bonampak. The site lies in Ocosingo Municipality in the state of Chiapas, on the Mexican side of the international border with Guatemala, which follows the line of river. It is downriver from the Maya site Altar de Sacrificios.\n\nYaxchilan has its origins in the Preclassic Period. A large part of what is known of the Classic Period history of the city comes from the hieroglyphic texts of the kings who ruled during its Late Classic apogee, one of the most important of which is Hieroglyphic Stairway 1. Some retrospective inscriptions appear to have been used to rewrite Yaxchilan's dynastic history to suit king Bird Jaguar IV. Before the rule of king Itzamnaaj Balam II, who reigned from 681 to 742, the city was relatively small. The city-state then grew to a regional capital and the dynasty lasted into the early 9th century.\n\nThe known history of Yaxchilan starts with the enthronement of Yopaat B'alam I, most likely on 23 July 359. He was the founder of a long dynasty, and took the throne when Yaxchilan was still a minor site. Hieroglyphic inscriptions dating to the Late Classic describe a series of wars in the Early Classic between the city and its neighbours. K'inich Tatb'u Skull I ruled in the early 5th century and was the first of the rulers of Yaxchilan to be recorded as having taken a rival king as a war captive, his prisoner being king Bird Jaguar of Bonampak (not to be confused with the four rulers of Yaxchilan who bore the same name). The long running rivalry with Piedras Negras had already begun by the fifth century AD, with both cities struggling to dominate the Usumacinta trade route. King Moon Skull was credited with gaining a victory over Piedras Negras in 460 and with capturing the enemy king, known only as Ruler A. By the middle of the 5th century Yaxchilan had formal contacts with the great city of Tikal. Bird Jaguar II, the next king of Yaxchilan, captured a vassal of the king of Piedras Negras around 478.\n\nKnot-eye Jaguar I was a warlike king who was recorded as capturing nobles from Bonampak, Piedras Negras and the great city of Tikal. In 514, Knot-eye Jaguar I was taken captive by Ruler C of Piedras Negras, as depicted on Lintel 12 from that city, where he is shown kneeling before the enemy king with his wrists bound.\n\nHis successor, K'inich Tatb'u Skull II, was enthroned on 11 February 526. This king is notable for the series of carved lintels he commissioned, including a dynastic list that provides information on the early kings of the city. K'inich Tatb'u Skull II oversaw a revival of Yaxchilan's fortunes and he captured lords from Bonampak, Lakamtuun and, notably, the lord of Calakmul, one of the two great Maya powers of the Classic Period, as well as a success against Tikal, the second great power.\n\nLittle is known of the history of Yaxchilan from 537 to 629, although four kings are known to have reigned in this period. Knot-eye Jaguar II is known to have captured the lord of Lacanha in 564, one of the few events that can be identified from this period. It may be that the lack of an inscribed history for this lengthy period indicates that Yaxchilan had fallen under the dominion of a more powerful neighbour, such as Piedras Negras, Palenque or Toniná, all of which were powerful polities in the Usumacinta region at this time.\n\nThe Yaxchilano murals at Bonampak's Structure I commemorate Yaxchilan's appointment of Chan Muwaan I as subordinate ruler. Yaxchilan rebuilt the site to point back toward Yaxchilan.\n\nIn 629, Bird Jaguar III was enthroned as king of Yaxchilan. In 646 or 647 he captured a lord from the still unidentified site of Hix Witz (meaning \"Jaguar Hill\"), somewhere on the north side of the Usumacinta.\n\nYaxchilan reached its greatest power during the reigns of King Itzamnaaj B'alam II, who died in his 90s in 742, and his son Bird Jaguar IV. Itzamnaaj B'alam II was enthroned in October 681 and he ruled for more than sixty years. During the last third of his reign he was responsible for a monumental building programme that included the erection of magnificent buildings with richly carved lintels, hieroglyphic stairways and carved stelae, transforming the centre of the city. During his reign, the kingdom of Yaxchilán extended to include the nearby sites of La Pasadita and El Chicozapote to the northwest of the city. At times the sites of Lacanha and Bonampak appear to have been under his domination, although this region was controlled by Toniná in 715.\n\nIn 689, relatively early in his reign, Itzamnaaj B'alam II is recorded as having captured Aj Sak Ichiy Pat. In 713 he captured Aj K'an Usja, the \"ajaw\", or lord, of B'uktunn, an otherwise unknown site. In 726, Yaxchilan was defeated by its rival Piedras Negras, an event described on Piedras Negras Stela 8. A \"sajal\" (subordinate lord) of Itzamnaaj B'alam II was captured by the enemy city, an event that is completely absent from inscriptions at Yaxchilán itself although, importantly, there is no false claim of victory. It is after this period, over forty years into the reign of Itzamnaaj B'alam II, that this king embarked upon his impressive building programme, this may indicate that at this time Yaxchilan was able to exert independence from the hegemony of once powerful neighbours and claim greater political independence and more lucrative control of riverine trade. In 729, Itzamnaaj B'alam II captured Aj Popol Chay, the lord of Lacanha. This event, together with the other victories of Itzamnaaj Balam II's reign, is described both in the hieroglyphic texts of Structure 44 and also on a series of stelae near Structure 41. This victory over Lacanha is compared to the earlier victory of Knot-eye Jaguar II against the same city. Similarly, his capture of a lord of Hix Witz in 732 is compared to Bird Jaguar III's victory over the same site.\n\nIn 749, Yopaat B'alam II of Yaxchilan attended a ceremony to honour Itzam K'an Ahk II of Piedras Negras. If Yopaat B'alam II was king of Yaxchilan at this time, this would indicate that he was subordinate to the king of Piedras Negras. This event was recorded on Piedras Negras Panel 3; there are no records of the reign of Yopaat B'alam II at Yaxchilan itself, indicating that any records were later destroyed if he had indeed ruled there.\n\nYaxchilan retaliated in 759, gaining a victory over its enemy. Circa 790 CE, Yaxchilan's king Shield Jaguar III oversaw the installation of Chan Muwaan II in Bonampak, and hired Yaxchilano artisans to commemorate it (and the previous Chan Muwaan) in \"Structure I\"'s murals.\n\nIn 808, king K'inich Tatb'u Skull III marked his capture of K'inich Yat Ahk II, the last king of Piedras Negras, an event that probably represented the final overthrow of Yaxchilan's long running enemy, ending dynastic rule there and destroying the city as a capital.\n\nThe first published mention of the site seems to have been a brief mention by Juan Galindo in 1833, published by the Royal Geographical Society. Professor Edwin Rockstoh of the National College of Guatemala visited in 1881 and published another short account. Explorers Alfred Maudslay and Désiré Charnay arrived here within days of each other in 1882, and they published more detailed accounts of the ruins with drawings and photographs. Maudslay's report was published by the Royal Geographical Society in 1883. Teoberto Maler visited the site repeatedly from 1897 to 1900, his detailed two volume description of the ruins and other nearby sites was published by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University in 1903.\n\nIn 1931 Sylvanus Morley led a Carnegie Institution expedition to Yaxchilan, mapped the site and discovered more monuments.\n\nFrom 1970 onwards, Ian Graham made numerous visits to Yaxchilan and recorded the inscriptions there. These inscriptions were published from 1977 onwards in the \"Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions\" by the Peabody Museum of Harvard University.\n\nThe Mexican National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) conducted archeological research at Yaxchilan in 1972 - 1973, again in 1983, and further INAH work was conducted in the early 1990s. INAH has consolidated and preserved the central portion of the site.\n\nMayanist Tatiana Proskouriakoff did some pioneering work on deciphering Maya writing using the inscriptions of Yaxchilan, and was able to identify the glyphs for death, capture and captor. Since then Peter Mathews and others have expanded on her early work.\n\nSince 1990, the project \"La Pintura Mural Prehispánica en México\" (Prehispanic Wall Painting in Mexico) of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México has examined and recorded precolumbian murals such as those at Yaxchilan.\n\nYaxchilan has long been difficult to reach other than by river. Until recently, no roads existed within 100 miles. The only ways to get to the site were hundreds of miles by boat, or else by small plane. Since the construction of the Border Highway by the Mexican Government in the early 1980s, it is possible for tourists to visit. To reach the site, it is necessary now only to take an hour-long boat ride down the Usumacinta River from Frontera Corozal.\n\nSome Lacandon Maya still make pilgrimages to Yaxchilan to carry out rituals to the Maya gods.\n\nThe site contains impressive ruins, with palaces and temples bordering a large plaza upon a terrace above the Usumacinta River. The architectural remains extend across the higher terraces and the hills to the south of the river, overlooking both the river itself and the lowlands beyond. Yaxchilan is known for the large quantity of excellent sculpture at the site, such as the monolithic carved stelae and the narrative stone reliefs carved on lintels spanning the temple doorways. Over 120 inscriptions have been identified on the various monuments from the site.\n\nThe major groups are the Central Acropolis, the West Acropolis and the South Acropolis. The South Acropolis occupies the highest part of the site. The site is aligned with relation to the Usumacinta River, at times causing unconventional orientation of the major structures, such as the two ballcourts.\n\nStructure 6 is near the Main Plaza in the Central Acropolis. It is in a good state of preservation and has six doorways, three facing the plaza and three facing the river. The doorways that open onto the plaza were blocked up in antiquity and new doorways were cut into the sides of the structure. The facade of the building facing the plaza has a surviving frieze with a sculpture of a head. The structure has a surviving perforated roof comb and is believed to date to the Early Classic.\n\nStructure 7 is beside Structure 6 but is in a much poorer state of preservation, with its vaulted ceiling having collapsed. This structure also had doorways facing both the river and the Main Plaza.\n\nStructure 8 is located in the Main Plaza in front of Structure 7 and divides the plaza into northwestern and southeastern sections.\n\nStructure 9 is an unrestored mound northwest of Structure 7. Stela 27 stands in front of it.\n\nStructure 10 shares an L-shaped platform with Structures 13 and 74, in the Central Acropolis. The structure contains a series of hieroglyphic lintels describing the birth and accession of king Bird Jaguar IV.\n\nStructure 12 is a small structure in the Central Acropolis, close to the river. It contained eight lintels dating to the early 6th century. The structure is located in the Central Acropolis close to one of the ballcourts. The lintels record nine generations of rulers of the city. The lintels were commissioned by K'inich Tatb'u Skull II, their original location is unknown, being reset into Structure 12 in the 8th century by king Bird Jaguar IV. Some of the lintels remain in place.\n\nStructure 13 rests on an L-shaped platform in the Central Acropolis, together with Structures 10 and 74.\n\nStructure 14 is the northwest ballcourt. It is located on the Main Plaza of the Central Acropolis. Five sculpted ballcourt markers were found here, three of which were aligned on the playing area and one on each of the platforms to either side. One of the ballcourt markers was removed from the site, the rest are broken and eroded.\n\nStructure 16 is close to the northwest ballcourt. It contains Lintels 38 through to 40, which have been reset in their original positions.\nStructure 19 is also known as the Labyrinth. It lies at the western edge of the Central Acropolis. The structure is a temple with rooms spread over three levels, linked by interior stairways. The temple facade has four doorways, with three doorway-sized niches between them. Two sculptured altars are located in front of the structure, which still has the remains of a perforated roof comb.\n\nStructure 20 is in the Central Acropolis and has three rooms. The three doorways to this structure once supported sculpted Lintels 12, 13 and 14, although only two now remain. A small amount of the roof comb of the building remains, and the sloped roof still has surviving friezes containing niches. Structure 20 was excavated by Ian Graham in 1982, during the excavations a hieroglyphic step was found in front of the building, it was reburied in order to preserve it.\n\nStructure 21 is on a terrace below Structure 25 and 26. The three lintels over the doorways in this structure were Lintels 15 through to 17, although they were removed in the 19th century and are now in the British Museum in London. Structure 21 was excavated in 1983. The vaulted roof of the structure had already collapsed before 1882, filling the rooms with rubble that has now been removed, uncovering several important monuments, including Stela 35 and the remains of life size stucco figures on the back wall behind the stela itself.\n\nStructure 22 is on a terrace in the Central Acropolis near the Main Plaza. It still has sculptured lintels in place.\n\nStructure 23 is in the Central Acropolis, overlooking the Main Plaza. It was built during the reign of Itzamnaaj B'alam II and is especially significant because it was the first major construction undertaken after a lapse of 150 years. Structure 23 is dedicated to Lady K'ab'al Xook, a wife of the king. It originally had three lintels set above its doorways that appear to mark the re-founding of Yaxchilan in an effort to reinforce the lineage and right to rule of king Itzamnaaj B'alam II. Lintels 24 and 25 were removed at the end of the 19th century and are now in the British Museum, while Lintel 26 is in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. This series of lintels are among the finest relief sculpture surviving in the Maya region.\n\nStructure 24 is on a terrace near the Main Plaza in the Central Acropolis. It still has sculptured lintels in place.\n\nStructure 25 is in the Central Acropolis close to the approach to Structure 33. It has not been excavated or restored, although it has some intact vaulting.\n\nStructure 26 is located beside Structure 25 in the Central Acropolis and has not been excavated. It is the least well preserved of the two structures.\n\nStructure 30 is in the Central Acropolis, it has three doorways facing onto the Plaza. The structure has two parallel rooms with well-preserved vaulting.\n\nStructure 33, in the Central Acropolis, has been described as a masterpiece in stone and was probably dedicated in 756 by Bird Jaguar IV. The structure overlooks the plaza and the river and would have been prominent to river traffic in the 8th century. It has plain lower walls with three doorways, each of the which supports a well-preserved lintel (Yaxchilan Lintels 1 to 3). In centre of the back wall of the structure, opposite the central doorway, is a niche containing the headless sculpture of a human figure, probably Bird Jaguar IV himself. The roof of the structure is largely intact, including a sloped roof supporting a frieze and a well-preserved roof comb. There are niches in both the roof comb and the frieze, the niche in the roof comb contains the remains of a sculpted figure. Tennons on both roof sections once supported stucco decoration. Leading up to the front of Structure 33 from the plaza is a stairway, the top step of which is sculpted, this step is known as Hieroglyphic Stairway 2.\n\nThe South Acropolis consists of Structures 39, 40 and 41. A number of stelae and altars are associated with them.\n\nStructure 39 has been restored and lies within the South Acropolis. It has three stepped doorways that open onto a single, irregularly shaped room. The remains of a perforated roof comb survive, with tenons that once supported stucco decoration.\n\nStructure 40 is flanked by structures 39 and 41. It has been restored and also has three doorways opening onto a single room and the remains of a perforated roof comb. The room has the remains of murals that once covered all the interior walls. Stelae 12 and 13 stand before structure 40 and Stela 11 once stood between them.\n\nStructure 41 has also been restored. Like the other two structures in the South Acropolis, it has three doorways that open onto a single room. It is not as well preserved as Structures 39 and 40 and much of the vaulted roof has collapsed. A fraction of stucco frieze from the sculpture may date the building to 740, the 3rd K'atun anniversary of Itzamnaaj B'alam II's reign. The central doorway is stepped and the front wall has been buttressed. It is one of three principal structures atop the highest vantage point in the city and a series of stelae was set in front of it that described the military campaigns of Itzamnaaj B'alam II.\n\nStructure 42 is located in the West Acropolis. The structure had a series if carved limestone lintels that depict Bird Jaguar IV's efforts to consolidate power, emulating events carried out by his father Itzamnaaj B'alam II.\n\nStructure 44 is in the West Acropolis. It still contains a carved lintel, and has sculpted steps. A number of stelae were originally associated with Structure 44. This temple was built by Itzamnaaj B'alam II and was dedicated around 732. The sculpted texts from this building provide an account of the 8th century resurgence of the city. Each of the three doorways contained sculptured lintels and two hieroglyphic steps.\n\nStructure 67 is the southeast ballcourt, located in the Central Acropolis.\n\nHieroglyphic Stairway 1 leads up to Structure 5 in the Central Acropolis. It has six sculpted risers consisting of various carved blocks, many of which are heavily eroded.\n\nHieroglyphic Stairway 2 is the riser of the uppermost step approaching Structure 33. It consists of 13 sculptured blocks, numbered from left to right as Steps I to XIII. Steps VI, VII and XVIII are extremely well preserved and depict Bird Jaguar IV and two of his predecessors dressed as ball players.\n\nLintel 1 is above the eastern doorway of Structure 33 in the Central Acropolis. It depicts 8th-century king Bird Jaguar IV accompanied by his wife Lady Great Skull Zero.\n\nLintel 2 is set above the central doorway of Structure 33. It shows Bird Jaguar IV accompanied by his son and heir, Shield Jaguar II.\nLintel 3 is above the westernmost doorway of Structure 33. It also shows Bird Jaguar IV, this time accompanied by an ally.\n\nLintel 10 is the last known monument at Yaxchilan, dating to 808. It depicts K'inich Yat Ahk II of Piedras Negras as a captive of Yachilan king K'inich Tatbu Skull IV.\n\nLintel 12 was originally set into Structure 20 in the Central Acropolis. It is now in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City.\n\nLintel 13 is above a doorway in Structure 20. It had fallen when the roof of the building collapsed but has since been reset. The sculpture on the lintel is very well preserved.\n\nLintel 14 is set above a doorway in Structure 20 and is particularly well preserved.\n\nLintel 15 originally spanned a doorway in Structure 21, it was removed to the British Museum in 1982-3. Like Lintels 16 and 17 from the same series, it was carved from limestone. It was originally set above the southeast doorway of the central room. Lintel 15 depicts Lady Wak Tuun, one of the wives of king Bird Jaguar IV, during a bloodletting ritual that results in the appearance of the Vision Serpent. Lady Wak Tuun is carrying a basket containing the tools used for the bloodletting ritual, including a stingray spine, rope and bloodstained paper. The Vision Serpent emerges from a bowl containing strips of bark paper.\n\nLintel 16 also spanned a doorway in Structure 21 and was removed to the British Museum in 1982-3. It was sculpted from limestone and was originally set above the central doorway of the central room. It shows Bird Jaguar IV holding a spear and standing over a kneeling captive. Bird Jaguar IV wears the same costume that his father is depicted wearing on Lintel 26. The capture event depicted on Lintel 16 took place in 752.\n\nLintel 17 was another lintel from a doorway in Structure 21 that is now in the British Museum. It is sculpted from limestone and was originally set above the northwest doorway of the central room. It dates to the reign of Bird Jaguar IV. The lintel depicts Bird Jaguar IV and his wife Lady B'alam Mut participating in a bloodletting ritual. The king watches while his wife pulls a rope through her tongue draw blood. This ritual is recorded as having taken place eight days after the capture event depicted on Lintel 16.\nLintel 24 is sculpted from limestone and is regarded as a masterpiece of Maya art. It is one of a series of three lintels that were set above the doorways of Structure 23, this one having been set above the southeast doorway. It shows a bloodletting ritual being carried out by king Itzamnaaj B'alam II and his wife Lady K'ab'al Xook, the king stands holding a burning torch over his wife, who pulls a spiked rope through her tongue. A screenfold book lies in a basket in front of the kneeling princess. The lintel has traces of red and blue pigments. The ceremony represented on the sculpture took place on 28 October, 709. Lintel 24 was removed at the end of the 19th century and is now on display in the British Museum.\n\nLintel 25 was originally set above the central doorway of Structure 23. It was carved from limestone during the reign of king Itzamnaaj B'alam II and shows Lady Xook invoking the Vision Serpent to commemorate the accession of her husband to the throne. Lady Xook holds a bowl containing bloodletting apparatus consisting of a stingray spine and bloodstained paper. The Vision Serpent rising before her has two heads, one at each extreme, from the mouth of one emerges a warrior, from the other emerges the head of central Mexican deity Tlaloc, a water god from the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. The hieroglyphic inscription on the lintel is unusual, being reversed as if it were meant to be read in a mirror, although the significance of this is unknown. Like Lintel 24, Lintel 25 was removed at the end of the 19th century and is now on display in the British Museum. The events depicted on the lintel are described as having occurred \"in front of the water of Siyan Chan\", a reference to the main plaza of the city being located on the shore of the Usumacinta River.\nLintel 26 was the third in the series set above the doorways of Structure 23, it is now in the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City. It dates to 726 and bears a portrait of Itzamnaaj B'alam II.\n\nLintel 29 is set into Structure 10 in the Central Acropolis. It is part of a series of three lintels bearing a continuous hieroglyphic text detailing the birth and accession of king Bird Jaguar IV.\n\nLintel 30 is part of the lintel series carved with a continuous hieroglyphic text set into Structure 10.\n\nLintel 31 is another part of the series of three hieroglyphic lintels set into Structure 10.\n\nLintel 35 was found by Maudslay among the rubble of Structure 12 and is now kept at the British Museum. It was sculpted from limestone in the 6th century under the rule of K'inich Tatb'u Skull II and records a series of victories including that over the great city of Calakmul.\n\nLintel 38, Lintel 39 and Lintel 40 have been reset in their original positions in Structure 16 in the Central Acropolis. Unlike most of the other lintels at Yaxchilan, they are sculpted on their edges instead of the undersides.\n\nLintel 41 was set above the south doorway of Structure 42 in the West Acropolis. It had fallen and broken into two pieces when Maudsley found it in the late 19th century. The upper section is on display in the British Museum, the lower section is damaged. The lintel was carved from limestone and is one of a series of lintels set in the same structure that celebrate the victories of king Bird Jaguar IV. The king is shown preparing for a battle that took place in 755, his wife is offering him his spear, she is Lady Wak Jalam Chan Ajaw from the site of Motul de San José in the Petén Lakes region of Guatemala.\n\nLintel 50 is set into Structure 13 in the Central Acropolis.\n\nLintel 60 remains in its original setting in Structure 12. It was discovered during excavations of the structure in 1984.\n\nStela 2 is on the lowest terrace opposite the stairway approach to Structure 33. It is badly weathered and dates to 613.\n\nStela 3 stands on a platform in the middle of a plaza by Structure 20. It was badly damaged and the fragments have been reassembled and the monument re-erected. One side of the stela has well-preserved sculpture.\n\nStela 5 is in front of the terrace holding Structure 20. The upper part of this monument depicts king Itzamnaaj B'alam II.\n\nStela 6 stands in front of the terrace supporting Structure 20. It is largely intact and depicts the 7th-century ruler Bird Jaguar III.\n\nStela 7 was badly damaged, being broken into fragments. The monument has now been reassembled and the surviving sculpture is of excellent quality. The stela stands in front of a terrace below Structure 20. It depicts a kneeling figure.\n\nStela 11 originally stood in front of Structure 40. The stela was removed in 1964 and shipped upriver to Agua Azul to be flown to Mexico City for display in the Museo Nacional de Antropología. However, it was too heavy to fly and was returned to Yaxchilan in 1965 and now lies near the bank of the river. The upper side of the stela depicts king Bird Jaguar IV and his father. The figures and the accompanying hieroglyphic panel are very well preserved. There are various dates inscribed on the stela with the earliest being 741. The stela is broken into two parts.\n\nStela 18 dates from some time after 723. It depicts the victorious king Itzamnaaj B'alam II standing over a kneeling captive, who is identified as Aj Popol Chaj, the ruling lord of Lacanha.\n\nStela 27 has been re-erected in front of Structure 9 on the Main Plaza in the Central Acropolis. The monument dates to 514 and depicts the king Knot-eye Jaguar I. This stela is the earliest known from Yaxchilan. Stela 27 is particularly notable because it was obviously damaged in antiquity and subsequently restored in the Late Classic, with substantial reworking in the lower third of the stela dating to the time of Bird Jaguar IV.\n\nStela 31 is located a short distance in front of Structure 33. It is a particularly unusual monument because it is sculpted from a stalactite. It is undated and depicts three incised figures and some hieroglyphs.\n\nStela 33 is a fragmented monument that was discovered during excavations of the platform supporting Stela 3.\n\nStela 35 is an exceptionally well preserved monument found during excavations of Structure 21 in 1983. The stela is fairly small and depicts Lady Eveningstar (also known as Lady Ik Skull), the mother of king Bird Jaguar IV.\n\nAll dates AD.\n\nMoon Skull was the seventh known ruler of Yaxchilan and ruled in the 5th century. His name is not an actual reference to the moon but is rather the Maya word for a spear-thrower.\n\nBird Jaguar II was the eighth king in the dynastic record of Yaxchilan. Two of his sons became kings after him, Knot-eye Jaguar I and K'inich Tatb'u Skull II.\n\nKnot-eye Jaguar I was the ninth known king of Yaxchilan, he reigned in the early 6th century. His glyphic name should probably be read as Joy B'alam. He was a son of the previous ruler, Bird Jaguar II.\n\nK'inich Tatb'u Skull II is the tenth in the dynastic king list. He was another son of Bird Jaguar II.\n\nBird Jaguar III is described in one text as fifteenth in line from Yopaat B'alam I. Bird Jaguar III took Lady Pakal as his wife, who lived a very long life, dying in 705 at the age of at least 98 years. Their son and heir was Itzamnaaj B'alam II.\n\nItzamnaak B'alam II acceded in October 681 and ruled for 60 years. He was often referred to in hieroglyphic texts as \"Master of Aj Nik\", referring to the capture of his first captive before he became king, this phrase being attached to his name on 32 separate occasions. Aj Nik himself was a sub-lord from a place known as either \"Maan\" or \"Namaan\" and was not of high rank.\n\n"}
{"id": "1422131", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1422131", "title": "Šatrovački", "text": "Šatrovački\n\nŠatrovački (; Serbian Cyrillic: шатровачки) or šatra (; Serbian Cyrillic: шатра) is an argot in the Serbo-Croatian language. Šatrovački was initially developed by various subcultures in Yugoslavia and used a form of secret communication within various ingroups. Today, it is primarily used among youth as a form of pig latin. It is more widespread in urban areas, such as capitals Belgrade (Serbia), Zagreb (Croatia) and Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina).\n\nWords are formed by replacing the syllable order. For example: pivo\" (beer), becomes \"vopi. The new word has the same meaning as the stem. Since the spelling is nearly phonetic it does not change. However, sometimes one of the vowels is changed to make the new word easier to pronounce, avoid ambiguity, or if the stem word is not in nominative. For example, \"trava\" (\"grass\", marijuana) would become \"vutra\" instead of \"vatra\" (\"fire\").\n\nSome words are more commonly spoken in Šatrovački than others, but there is no specific rule. Examples of transformed sentences (although, most of the words in a single sentence are rarely transformed) are:\n\n\n\nUtrovački (Утровачки) is a more complex form of \"šatrovački\". Words are formed using: U + last part + ZA + first part + NJE. E.g. vikipedija (Wikipedia) becomes ukipedijazavinje. Today, utrovački is not widely used.\n\nAlternative Utrovački is same as above, but without \"ZA\", e.g. pivo (beer) becomes uvopinje, or cigare (tobacco) becomes ugarecinje.\n\nA more simplified version of šatrovački is using only parts of the word, while excluding the first syllable, and is most commonly used among young people in Serbia. For example, koncert (concert) would be shorthened to cert. The rules of creating a new word that can be used in nominative while the stem is not apply similarly to standard šatrovački. An example of a full sentence would be:\n\nThis is particularly characteristic of Novi Sad youth subculture, and is very rarely spoken outside of Vojvodina.\n\n\nA very rare but present form of expression found in the Belgrade projects (blokovi). Words are reconstructed by adding various suffixes so that the original word remains relatively intact. Usually, the basis is šatrovački. The resulting words have a generally diminutive meaning.\n\n\nThese diminutives can later be combined using the Šatrovački method, resulting in words like \"kajblo\", or \"kićblo\". However, this is a rare usage, confined to the area of Zemun and New Belgrade.\n\nAlso there is another type of šatrovački, where the words are reconstructed by addition of letter P after each syllable:\n\n\n\n"}
