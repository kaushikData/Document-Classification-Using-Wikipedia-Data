The stories are contained by a frame narrative in which ten members of a club each tell one story about a noble dame in the 17th or 18th century.\n\nPart I—Before Dinner\nPart II—After Dinner\n\nAll ten stories were published in serial magazines before Hardy collected them into book form. \"The Duchess of Hamptonshire\" and \"The Honourable Laura\" were written relatively early in Hardy's career, in 1878 and 1881 respectively. \"The First Countess of Wessex\" and \"The Lady Penelope\" were written in 1888-89. Hardy revised all four of these stories significantly before adding them to the collection in 1891. The remaining six stories were written in early 1890 and published in bowdlerised form in a special Christmas number of \"The Graphic\" in December 1890.\n\nHardy collected all ten stories together for the first time in \"A Group of Noble Dames\", which was published in England by Osgood, McIlvaine, & Co. and in America by Harper & Brothers in 1891. The critical reception of the book was mixed.\n\n\"Barbara of the House of Grebe\" was adapted as a television drama by the BBC as part of an anthology series called \"Wessex Tales\".

Set in ancient Athens, the teacher is modelled on Socrates, who so desperately wants to consummate the relationship he has with Alcibiades, one of his students, that he uses all tactics of rhetoric and sophistry at his disposal. He argues that Nature gave us sexual organs for our own pleasure, and that it would insult her to use them otherwise, citing examples from Greek mythology and culture, as well as refuting counterarguments based on the Sodom and Gomorrah story. It is \"a tour de force of pederastic fantasy and one of the frankest and most explicit texts on the subject to have been written before the twentieth century.\" It has been called \"the first homosexual novel\".\n\nFor many years the identity of the author was a mystery. The work was first attributed to Pietro Aretino, but an article in 1888 by Achille Neri identified the author as Antonio Rocco, a libertine priest and philosopher and member of the Accademia degli Incogniti founded by Giovan Battista Loredan.\n\nThe text is unashamedly explicit, and it has been argued that \"it must be understood in the context of similar texts of the trend of libertinism, using the term in its original sense of a sceptical philosophical tendency.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "199154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199154", "title": "American literature", "text": "American literature\n\nAmerican literature is literature written or produced in the United States and its preceding colonies (for specific discussions of poetry and theater, see Poetry of the United States and Theater in the United States). Before the founding of the United States, the British colonies on the eastern coast of the present-day United States were heavily influenced by English literature. The American literary tradition thus began as part of the broader tradition of English literature. \n\nThe revolutionary period is notable for the political writings of Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Paine. Thomas Jefferson's United States Declaration of Independence solidified his status as a key American writer. It was in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that the nation's first novels were published. An early example is William Hill Brown's \"The Power of Sympathy\" published in 1791. Brown's novel depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fall in love without knowing they are related. \n\nWith an increasing desire to produce uniquely American literature and culture, a number of key new literary figures emerged, perhaps most prominently Washington Irving and Edgar Allan Poe. In 1836, Ralph Waldo Emerson started an influential movement known as Transcendentalism. Inspired by that movement, Henry David Thoreau wrote \"Walden\", which celebrates individualism and nature and urges resistance to the dictates of organized society. The political conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired the writings of William Lloyd Garrison and Harriet Beecher Stowe in her famous novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". These efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narratives such as Frederick Douglass's \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, Nathaniel Hawthorne published his magnum opus \"The Scarlet Letter\", a novel about adultery. Hawthorne influenced Herman Melville, who is notable for the books \"Moby-Dick\" and \"Billy Budd\". America's greatest poets of the nineteenth century were Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson. Mark Twain (the pen name used by Samuel Langhorne Clemens) was the first major American writer to be born away from the East Coast. Henry James put American literature on the international map with novels like \"The Portrait of a Lady\". At the turn of the twentieth century a strong naturalist movement emerged that comprised writers such as Edith Wharton, Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser, and Jack London.\n\nAmerican writers expressed disillusionment following World War I. The short stories and novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald captured the mood of the 1920s, and John Dos Passos wrote too about the war. Ernest Hemingway became famous with \"The Sun Also Rises\" and \"A Farewell to Arms\"; in 1954, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature. William Faulkner became one of the greatest American writers with novels like \"The Sound and the Fury\". American poetry reached a peak after World War I with such writers as Wallace Stevens, T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, Ezra Pound, and E. E. Cummings. American drama attained international status at the time with the works of Eugene O'Neill, who won four Pulitzer Prizes and the Nobel Prize. In the mid-twentieth century, American drama was dominated by the work of playwrights Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, as well as by the maturation of the American musical.\n\nDepression era writers included John Steinbeck, notable for his novel \"The Grapes of Wrath\". Henry Miller assumed a distinct place in American Literature in the 1930s when his semi-autobiographical novels were banned from the US. From the end of World War II until the early 1970s many popular works in modern American literature were produced, like Harper Lee's \"To Kill a Mockingbird\". America's involvement in World War II influenced works such as Norman Mailer's \"The Naked and the Dead\" (1948), Joseph Heller's \"Catch-22\" (1961) and Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" (1969). The main literary movement since the 1970s has been postmodernism, and since the late twentieth century ethnic and minority literature has sharply increased.\n\nBecause of the large immigration to Boston in the 1630s, the articulation of Puritan ideals, and the early establishment of a college and a printing press in Cambridge, the New England colonies have often been regarded as the center of early American literature. However, the first European settlements in North America had been founded elsewhere many years earlier. Towns older than Boston include the Spanish settlements at Saint Augustine and Santa Fe, the Dutch settlements at Albany and New Amsterdam, as well as the English colony of Jamestown in present-day Virginia. During the colonial period, the printing press was active in many areas, from Cambridge and Boston to New York, Philadelphia, and Annapolis.\n\nThe dominance of the English language was not inevitable. The first item printed in Pennsylvania was in German and was the largest book printed in any of the colonies before the American Revolution. Spanish and French had two of the strongest colonial literary traditions in the areas that now comprise the United States, and discussions of early American literature commonly include texts by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and Samuel de Champlain alongside English language texts by Thomas Harriot and John Smith. Moreover, we are now aware of the wealth of oral literary traditions already existing on the continent among the numerous different Native American groups. Political events, however, would eventually make English the lingua franca for the colonies at large as well as the literary language of choice. For instance, when the English conquered New Amsterdam in 1664, they renamed it New York and changed the administrative language from Dutch to English.\n\nFrom 1696 to 1700, only about 250 separate items were issued from the major printing presses in the American colonies. This is a small number compared to the output of the printers in London at the time. London printers published materials written by New England authors, so the body of American literature was larger than what was published in North America. However, printing was established in the American colonies before it was allowed in most of England. In England, restrictive laws had long confined printing to four locations, where the government could monitor what was published: London, York, Oxford, and Cambridge. Because of this, the colonies ventured into the modern world earlier than their provincial English counterparts.\n\nBack then, some of the American literature were pamphlets and writings extolling the benefits of the colonies to both a European and colonist audience. Captain John Smith could be considered the first American author with his works: \"A True Relation of Such Occurrences and Accidents of Noate as Hath Happened in Virginia...\" (1608) and \"The Generall Historie of Virginia, New England, and the Summer Isles\" (1624). Other writers of this manner included Daniel Denton, Thomas Ash, William Penn, George Percy, William Strachey, Daniel Coxe, Gabriel Thomas, and John Lawson.\n\nThe religious disputes that prompted settlement in America were important topics of early American literature. A journal written by John Winthrop, \"The History of New England\", discussed the religious foundations of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Edward Winslow also recorded a diary of the first years after the \"Mayflower's\" arrival. \"A modell of Christian Charity\" by John Winthrop, the first governor of Massachusetts, was a Sermon preached on the \"Arbella\" (the flagship of the Winthrop Fleet) in 1630. This work outlined the ideal society that he and the other Separatists would build in an attempt to realize a \"Puritan utopia\". Other religious writers included Increase Mather and William Bradford, author of the journal published as a \"History of Plymouth Plantation, 1620–47\". Others like Roger Williams and Nathaniel Ward more fiercely argued state and church separation. And still others, like Thomas Morton, cared little for the church; Morton's \"The New English Canaan\" mocked the religious settlers and declared that the Native Americans were actually better people than the British.\n\nPuritan poetry was highly religious, and one of the earliest books of poetry published was the \"Bay Psalm Book\", a set of translations of the biblical Psalms; however, the translators' intention was not to create literature, but to create hymns that could be used in worship. Among lyric poets, the most important figures are Anne Bradstreet, who wrote personal poems about her family and homelife; pastor Edward Taylor, whose best poems, the \"Preparatory Meditations\", were written to help him prepare for leading worship; and Michael Wigglesworth, whose best-selling poem, \"The Day of Doom\" (1660), describes the time of judgment. It was published in the same year that anti-Puritan Charles II was restored to the British throne. He followed it two years later with \"God's Controversy With New England\". Nicholas Noyes was also known for his doggerel verse.\n\nOther late writings described conflicts and interaction with the Indians, as seen in writings by Daniel Gookin, Alexander Whitaker, John Mason, Benjamin Church, and Mary Rowlandson. John Eliot translated the Bible into the Algonquin language.\n\nOf the second generation of New England settlers, Cotton Mather stands out as a theologian and historian, who wrote the history of the colonies with a view to God's activity in their midst and to connecting the Puritan leaders with the great heroes of the Christian faith. His best-known works include the \"Magnalia Christi Americana\", the \"Wonders of the Invisible World\" and \"The Biblia Americana\".\n\nJonathan Edwards and George Whitefield represented the Great Awakening, a religious revival in the early 18th century that emphasized Calvinism. Other Puritan and religious writers include Thomas Hooker, Thomas Shepard, John Wise, and Samuel Willard. Less strict and serious writers included Samuel Sewall (who wrote a diary revealing the daily life of the late 17th century), and Sarah Kemble Knight.\n\nNew England was not the only area in the colonies with a literature: southern literature was also growing at this time. The diary of William Byrd and \"The History of the Dividing Line\" described the expedition to survey the swamp between Virginia and North Carolina but also comments on the differences between American Indians and the white settlers in the area. In a similar book, \"Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West\", William Bartram described the Southern landscape and the Indian tribes he encountered; Bartram's book was popular in Europe, being translated into German, French and Dutch.\n\nAs the colonies moved toward independence from Britain, an important discussion of American culture and identity came from the French immigrant J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur, whose \"Letters from an American Farmer\" addresses the question \"What is an American?\" by moving between praise for the opportunities and peace offered in the new society and recognition that the solid life of the farmer must rest uneasily between the oppressive aspects of the urban life and the lawless aspects of the frontier, where the lack of social structures leads to the loss of civilized living.\n\nThis same period saw the beginning of black literature, through the poet Phillis Wheatley and the slave narrative of Olaudah Equiano, \"The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano\". At this time American Indian literature also began to flourish. Samson Occom published his \"A Sermon Preached at the Execution of Moses Paul\" and a popular hymnbook, \"Collection of Hymns and Spiritual Songs\", \"the first Indian best-seller\".\n\nThe Revolutionary period also contained political writings, including those by colonists Samuel Adams, Josiah Quincy, John Dickinson, and Joseph Galloway, the last being a loyalist to the crown. Two key figures were Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Paine. Franklin's \"Poor Richard's Almanac\" and \"The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin\" are esteemed works with their wit and influence toward the formation of a budding American identity. Paine's pamphlet \"Common Sense\" and \"The American Crisis\" writings are seen as playing a key role in influencing the political tone of the time.\n\nDuring the Revolutionary War, poems and songs such as \"Yankee Doodle\" and \"Nathan Hale\" were popular. Major satirists included John Trumbull and Francis Hopkinson. Philip Morin Freneau also wrote poems about the War.\n\nDuring the 18th century, writing shifted from the Puritanism of Winthrop and Bradford to Enlightenment ideas of reason. The belief that human and natural occurrences were messages from God no longer fit with the new human-centered world. Many intellectuals believed that the human mind could comprehend the universe through the laws of physics as described by Isaac Newton. One of these was Cotton Mather. The first book published in North America that promoted Newton and natural theology was Mather's \"The Christian Philosopher\" (1721). The enormous scientific, economic, social, and philosophical, changes of the 18th century, called the Enlightenment, impacted the authority of clergyman and scripture, making way for democratic principles. The increase in population helped account for the greater diversity of opinion in religious and political life as seen in the literature of this time. In 1670, the population of the colonies numbered approximately 111,000. Thirty years later it was more than 250,000. By 1760, it reached 1,600,000. The growth of communities and therefore social life led people to become more interested in the progress of individuals and their shared experience in the colonies. These new ideas can be seen in the popularity of Benjamin Franklin's \"Autobiography\".\n\nEven earlier than Franklin was Cadwallader Colden (1689 - 1776), whose book \"The History of the Five Indian Nations\", published in 1727 was one of the first texts critical of the treatment of the Iroquois in upstate New York by the English. Colden also wrote a book on botany, which attracted the attention of Linnaeus, and he maintained a long term correspondence with Benjamin Franklin.\n\nIn the post-war period, Thomas Jefferson established his place in American literature through his authorship of the United States Declaration of Independence, his influence on the United States Constitution, his autobiography, his Notes on the State of Virginia, and his many letters. The Federalist essays by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay presented a significant historical discussion of American government organization and republican values. Fisher Ames, James Otis, and Patrick Henry are also valued for their political writings and orations.\n\nEarly American literature struggled to find a unique voice in existing literary genre, and this tendency was reflected in novels. European styles were frequently imitated, but critics usually considered the imitations inferior.\n\nIn the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the first American novels were published. These fictions were too lengthy to be printed as manuscript or public reading. Publishers took a chance on these works in hopes they would become steady sellers and need to be reprinted. This scheme was ultimately successful because male and female literacy rates were increasing at the time. Among the first American novels are Thomas Attwood Digges' \"Adventures of Alonso\", published in London in 1775 and William Hill Brown's \"The Power of Sympathy\" published in 1791. Brown's novel depicts a tragic love story between siblings who fell in love without knowing they were related. \n\nIn the next decade important women writers also published novels. Susanna Rowson is best known for her novel, \"Charlotte: A Tale of Truth\", published in London in 1791. In 1794 the novel was reissued in Philadelphia under the title, \"Charlotte Temple.\" \"Charlotte Temple\" is a seduction tale, written in the third person, which warns against listening to the voice of love and counsels resistance. She also wrote nine novels, six theatrical works, two collections of poetry, six textbooks, and countless songs. Reaching more than a million and a half readers over a century and a half, \"Charlotte Temple\" was the biggest seller of the 19th century before Stowe's \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" Although Rowson was extremely popular in her time and is often acknowledged in accounts of the development of the early American novel, \"Charlotte Temple\" is often criticized as a sentimental novel of seduction.\n\nHannah Webster Foster's \"The Coquette: Or, the History of Eliza Wharton\" was published in 1797 and was also extremely popular. Told from Foster's point of view and based on the real life of Eliza Whitman, the novel is about a woman who is seduced and abandoned. Eliza is a \"coquette\" who is courted by two very different men: a clergyman who offers her a comfortable domestic life and a noted libertine. Unable to choose between them, she finds herself single when both men get married. She eventually yields to the artful libertine and gives birth to an illegitimate stillborn child at an inn. \"The Coquette\" is praised for its demonstration of the era's contradictory ideas of womanhood. even as it has been criticized for delegitimizing protest against women's subordination. \nBoth \"The Coquette\" and \"Charlotte Temple\" are novels that treat the right of women to live as equals as the new democratic experiment. These novels are of the Sentimental genre, characterized by overindulgence in emotion, an invitation to listen to the voice of reason against misleading passions, as well as an optimistic overemphasis on the essential goodness of humanity. Sentimentalism is often thought to be a reaction against the Calvinistic belief in the depravity of human nature.\nWhile many of these novels were popular, the economic infrastructure of the time did not allow these writers to make a living through their writing alone.\n\nCharles Brockden Brown is the earliest American novelist whose works are still commonly read. He published \"Wieland\" in 1798, and in 1799 published \"Ormond\", \"Edgar Huntly\", and \"Arthur Mervyn\". These novels are of the Gothic genre.\n\nThe first writer to be able to support himself through the income generated by his publications alone was Washington Irving. He completed his first major book in 1809 entitled \"A History of New-York from the Beginning of the World to the End of the Dutch Dynasty.\"\n\nOf the picaresque genre, Hugh Henry Brackenridge published \"Modern Chivalry\" in 1792-1815; Tabitha Gilman Tenney wrote \"Female Quixotism: Exhibited in the Romantic Opinions and Extravagant Adventure of Dorcasina Sheldon\" in 1801; Royall Tyler wrote \"The Algerine Captive\" in 1797.\n\nOther notable authors include William Gilmore Simms, who wrote \"Martin Faber\" in 1833, \"Guy Rivers\" in 1834, and \"The Yemassee\" in 1835. Lydia Maria Child wrote \"Hobomok\" in 1824 and \"The Rebels\" in 1825. John Neal wrote \"Logan, A Family History\" in 1822, \"Rachel Dyer\" in 1828, and \"The Down-Easters\" in 1833. Catherine Maria Sedgwick wrote \"A New England Tale\" in 1822, \"Redwood\" in 1824, \"Hope Leslie\" in 1827, and \"The Linwoods\" in 1835. James Kirke Paulding wrote \"The Lion of the West\" in 1830, \"The Dutchman's Fireside\" in 1831, and \"Westward Ho!\" in 1832. Robert Montgomery Bird wrote \"Calavar\" in 1834 and \"Nick of the Woods\" in 1837. James Fenimore Cooper was also a notable author best known for his novel, \"The Last of the Mohicans\" written in 1826. George Tucker produced in 1824 the first fiction of Virginia colonial life with \"The Valley of Shenandoah\". He followed in 1827 with one of the country's first science fictions, \"A Voyage to the Moon: With Some Account of the Manners and Customs, Science and Philosophy, of the People of Morosofia, and Other Lunarians.\"\n\nAfter the War of 1812, there was an increasing desire to produce a uniquely American literature and culture, and a number of literary figures emerged, among them Washington Irving, William Cullen Bryant, and James Fenimore Cooper. Irving wrote humorous works in \"Salmagundi\" and the satire \"A History of New York, by Diedrich Knickerbocker\" (1809). Bryant wrote early romantic and nature-inspired poetry, which evolved away from their European origins.\n\nCooper's \"Leatherstocking Tales\" about Natty Bumppo (which includes \"The Last of the Mohicans\") were popular both in the new country and abroad. In 1832, Edgar Allan Poe began writing short stories – including \"The Masque of the Red Death\", \"The Pit and the Pendulum\", \"The Fall of the House of Usher\", and \"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\" – that explore previously hidden levels of human psychology and push the boundaries of fiction toward mystery and fantasy. \n\nHumorous writers were also popular and included Seba Smith and Benjamin Penhallow Shillaber in New England and Davy Crockett, Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, Johnson J. Hooper, Thomas Bangs Thorpe, and George Washington Harris writing about the American frontier.\n\nThe New England Brahmins were a group of writers connected to Harvard University and Cambridge, Massachusetts. They included James Russell Lowell, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.\nIn 1836, Ralph Waldo Emerson, a former minister, published his essay \"Nature\", which argued that men should dispense with organized religion and reach a lofty spiritual state by studying and interacting with the natural world. Emerson's work influenced the writers who formed the movement now known as Transcendentalism, while Emerson also influenced the public through his lectures. \n\nAmong the leaders of the Transcendental movement was Henry David Thoreau, a nonconformist and a close friend of Emerson. After living mostly by himself for two years in a cabin by a wooded pond, Thoreau wrote \"Walden\", a memoir that urges resistance to the dictates of society. Thoreau's writings demonstrate a strong American tendency toward individualism. Other Transcendentalists included Amos Bronson Alcott, Margaret Fuller, George Ripley, Orestes Brownson, and Jones Very.\n\nAs one of the great works of the Revolutionary period was written by a Frenchman, so too was a work about America from this generation. Alexis de Tocqueville's two-volume \"Democracy in America\" described his travels through the young nation, making observations about the relations between American politics, individualism, and community.\n\nThe political conflict surrounding abolitionism inspired the writings of William Lloyd Garrison and his paper \"The Liberator\", along with poet John Greenleaf Whittier and Harriet Beecher Stowe in her world-famous \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". These efforts were supported by the continuation of the slave narrative autobiography, of which the best known examples from this period include Frederick Douglass's \"Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave\" and Harriet Jacobs's \"Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\".\n\nAt the same time, American Indian autobiography develops, most notably in William Apess's \"A Son of the Forest\" and George Copway's \"The Life, History and Travels of Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh\". Moreover, minority authors were beginning to publish fiction, as in William Wells Brown's \"Clotel; or, The President's Daughter\", Frank J. Webb's \"The Garies and Their Friends\", Martin Delany's \"Blake; or, The Huts of America\" and Harriet E. Wilson's \"Our Nig\" as early African American novels, and John Rollin Ridge's \"The Life and Adventures of Joaquin Murieta: The Celebrated California Bandit\", which is considered the first Native American novel but which also is an early story about Mexican American issues.\nIn 1837, the young Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804–1864) collected some of his stories as \"Twice-Told Tales\", a volume rich in symbolism and occult incidents. Hawthorne went on to write full-length \"romances\", quasi-allegorical novels that explore the themes of guilt, pride, and emotional repression in New England. His masterpiece, \"The Scarlet Letter\", is a drama about a woman cast out of her community for committing adultery.\n\nHawthorne's fiction had a profound impact on his friend Herman Melville (1819–1891), who first made a name for himself by turning material from his seafaring days into exotic sea narrative novels. Inspired by Hawthorne's focus on allegories and psychology, Melville went on to write romances replete with philosophical speculation. In \"Moby-Dick\", an adventurous whaling voyage becomes the vehicle for examining such themes as obsession, the nature of evil, and human struggle against the elements.\n\nIn the short novel \"Billy Budd\", Melville dramatizes the conflicting claims of duty and compassion on board a ship in time of war. His more profound books sold poorly, and he had been long forgotten by the time of his death. He was rediscovered in the early 20th century.\n\nAnti-transcendental works from Melville, Hawthorne, and Poe all comprise the Dark Romanticism sub-genre of popular literature at this time.\n\nAmerican dramatic literature, by contrast, remained dependent on European models, although many playwrights did attempt to apply these forms to American topics and themes, such as immigrants, westward expansion, temperance, etc. At the same time, American playwrights created several long-lasting American character types, especially the \"Yankee\", the \"Negro\" and the \"Indian\", exemplified by the characters of Jonathan, Sambo and Metamora. In addition, new dramatic forms were created in the Tom Shows, the showboat theater and the minstrel show. Among the best plays of the period are James Nelson Barker's \"Superstition; or, the Fanatic Father\", Anna Cora Mowatt's \"Fashion; or, Life in New York\", Nathaniel Bannister's \"Putnam, the Iron Son of '76\", Dion Boucicault's \"The Octoroon; or, Life in Louisiana\", and Cornelius Mathews's \"Witchcraft; or, the Martyrs of Salem\".\n\nThe Fireside Poets (also known as the Schoolroom or Household Poets) were some of America's first major poets domestically and internationally. They were known for their poems being easy to memorize due to their general adherence to poetic form (standard forms, regular meter, and rhymed stanzas) and were often recited in the home (hence the name) as well as in school (such as \"Paul Revere's Ride\"), as well as working with distinctly American themes, including some political issues such as abolition. They included Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, William Cullen Bryant, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.. Longfellow achieved the highest level of acclaim and is often considered the first internationally acclaimed American poet, being the first American poet given a bust in Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner.\n\nWalt Whitman (1819–1892) and Emily Dickinson (1830–1886), two of America's greatest 19th-century poets could hardly have been more different in temperament and style. Walt Whitman was a working man, a traveler, a self-appointed nurse during the American Civil War (1861–1865), and a poetic innovator. His magnum opus was \"Leaves of Grass\", in which he uses a free-flowing verse and lines of irregular length to depict the all-inclusiveness of American democracy. Taking that motif one step further, the poet equates the vast range of American experience with himself without being egotistical. For example, in \"Song of Myself\", the long, central poem in \"Leaves of Grass\", Whitman writes: \"These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me ...\"\n\nIn his words Whitman was a poet of \"the body electric\". In \"Studies in Classic American Literature\", the English novelist D. H. Lawrence wrote that Whitman \"was the first to smash the old moral conception that the soul of man is something 'superior' and 'above' the flesh.\"\n\nBy contrast, Emily Dickinson lived the sheltered life of a genteel unmarried woman in small-town Amherst, Massachusetts. Her poetry is ingenious, witty, and penetrating. Her work was unconventional for its day, and little of it was published during her lifetime. Many of her poems dwell on the topic of death, often with a mischievous twist. One, \"Because I could not stop for Death\", begins, \"He kindly stopped for me.\" The opening of another Dickinson poem toys with her position as a woman in a male-dominated society and an unrecognized poet: \"I'm nobody! Who are you? / Are you nobody too?\" \n\nAmerican poetry arguably reached its peak in the early-to-mid-20th century, with such noted writers as Wallace Stevens and his \"Harmonium\" (1923) and \"The Auroras of Autumn\" (1950), T. S. Eliot and his \"The Waste Land\" (1922), Robert Frost and his \"North of Boston\" (1914) and \"New Hampshire\" (1923), Hart Crane and his \"White Buildings\" (1926) and the epic cycle, \"The Bridge\" (1930), Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams and his epic poem about his New Jersey hometown, \"Paterson\", Marianne Moore, E. E. Cummings, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Langston Hughes, in addition to many others.\n\nMark Twain (the pen name used by Samuel Langhorne Clemens, 1835–1910) was the first major American writer to be born away from the East Coast – in the border state of Missouri. His regional masterpieces were the memoir \"Life on the Mississippi\" and the novels \"Adventures of Tom Sawyer\" and \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\". Twain's style – influenced by journalism, wedded to the vernacular, direct and unadorned but also highly evocative and irreverently humorous – changed the way Americans write their language. His characters speak like real people and sound distinctively American, using local dialects, newly invented words, and regional accents.\n\nOther writers interested in regional differences and dialect were George W. Cable, Thomas Nelson Page, Joel Chandler Harris, Mary Noailles Murfree (Charles Egbert Craddock), Sarah Orne Jewett, Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Henry Cuyler Bunner, and William Sydney Porter (O. Henry). A version of local color regionalism that focused on minority experiences can be seen in the works of Charles W. Chesnutt (African American), of María Ruiz de Burton, one of the earliest Mexican American novelists to write in English, and in the Yiddish-inflected works of Abraham Cahan.\n\nWilliam Dean Howells also represented the realist tradition through his novels, including \"The Rise of Silas Lapham\" and his work as editor of \"The Atlantic Monthly\".\n\nHenry James (1843–1916) confronted the Old World-New World dilemma by writing directly about it. Although he was born in New York City, James spent most of his adult life in England. Many of his novels center on Americans who live in or travel to Europe. With its intricate, highly qualified sentences and dissection of emotional and psychological nuance, James's fiction can be daunting. Among his more accessible works are the novellas \"Daisy Miller\", about an American girl in Europe, and \"The Turn of the Screw\", a ghost story.\n\nRealism began to influence American drama, partly through Howells, but also through Europeans such as Ibsen and Zola. Although realism was most influential in set design and staging—audiences loved the special effects offered up by the popular melodramas—and in the growth of local color plays, it also showed up in the more subdued, less romantic tone that reflected the effects of the Civil War and continued social turmoil on the American psyche.\n\nThe most ambitious attempt at bringing modern realism into the drama was James Herne's \"Margaret Fleming\", which addressed issues of social determinism through realistic dialogue, psychological insight, and symbolism. The play was not successful, and both critics and audiences thought it dwelt too much on unseemly topics and included improper scenes, such as the main character nursing her husband's illegitimate child onstage.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, American novelists were expanding fiction to encompass both high and low life and sometimes connected to the naturalist school of realism. In her stories and novels, Edith Wharton (1862–1937) scrutinized the upper-class, Eastern-seaboard society in which she had grown up. One of her finest books, \"The Age of Innocence\", centers on a man who chooses to marry a conventional, socially acceptable woman rather than a fascinating outsider.\n\nAt about the same time, Stephen Crane (1871–1900), best known for his Civil War novel \"The Red Badge of Courage\", depicted the life of New York City prostitutes in \"\". And in \"Sister Carrie\", Theodore Dreiser (1871–1945) portrayed a country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman. Hamlin Garland and Frank Norris wrote about the problems of American farmers and other social issues from a naturalist perspective.\n\nPolitical writings discussed social issues and the power of corporations. Edward Bellamy's \"Looking Backward\" outlined other possible political and social orders, and Upton Sinclair, most famous for his muck-raking novel \"The Jungle\", advocated socialism. Other political writers of the period included Edwin Markham and William Vaughn Moody. Journalistic critics, including Ida M. Tarbell and Lincoln Steffens, were labeled \"The Muckrakers\". Henry Brooks Adams's literate autobiography, \"The Education of Henry Adams\" also depicted a stinging description of the education system and modern life.\n\nRace was a common issue as well, as seen in the work of Pauline Hopkins, who published five influential works from 1900 to 1903. Similarly, Sui Sin Far wrote about Chinese-American experiences, and Maria Cristina Mena wrote about Mexican-American experiences.\n\nThe 1920s brought sharp changes to American literature. Many writers had direct experience of the First World War, and they used it to frame their writings.\n\nExperimentation in style and form soon joined the new freedom in subject matter. In 1909, Gertrude Stein (1874–1946), by then an expatriate in Paris, published \"Three Lives\", an innovative work of fiction influenced by her familiarity with cubism, jazz, and other movements in contemporary art and music. Stein labeled a group of American literary notables who lived in Paris in the 1920s and 1930s the \"Lost Generation\".\n\nThe poet Ezra Pound (1885–1972) was born in Idaho but spent much of his adult life in Europe. His work is complex, sometimes obscure, with multiple references to other art forms and to a vast range of literature, both Western and Eastern. He influenced many other poets, notably T. S. Eliot (1888–1965), another expatriate. Eliot wrote spare, cerebral poetry, carried by a dense structure of symbols. In \"The Waste Land\", he embodied a jaundiced vision of post–World War I society in fragmented, haunted images. Like Pound's, Eliot's poetry could be highly allusive, and some editions of \"The Waste Land\" come with footnotes supplied by the poet. In 1948, Eliot won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nHenry James, Stein, Pound, and Eliot demonstrate the growth of an international perspective in American literature. American writers had long looked to European models for inspiration, but whereas the literary breakthroughs of the mid-19th century came from finding distinctly American styles and themes, writers from this period were finding ways of contributing to a flourishing international literary scene, not as imitators but as equals. Something similar was happening back in the States, as Jewish writers (such as Abraham Cahan) used the English language to reach an international Jewish audience.\nAmerican writers also expressed the disillusionment following upon the war. The stories and novels of F. Scott Fitzgerald (1896–1940) capture the restless, pleasure-hungry, defiant mood of the 1920s. Fitzgerald's characteristic theme, expressed poignantly in \"The Great Gatsby\", is the tendency of youth's golden dreams to dissolve in failure and disappointment. Fitzgerald also elucidates the collapse of some key American Ideals, such as liberty, social unity, good governance and peace, features which were severely threatened by the pressures of modern early 20th century society. Sinclair Lewis and Sherwood Anderson also wrote novels with critical depictions of American life. John Dos Passos wrote about the war and also the U.S.A. trilogy which extended into the Depression.\n\nErnest Hemingway (1899–1961) saw violence and death first-hand as an ambulance driver in World War I, and the carnage persuaded him that abstract language was mostly empty and misleading. He cut out unnecessary words from his writing, simplified the sentence structure, and concentrated on concrete objects and actions. He adhered to a moral code that emphasized grace under pressure, and his protagonists were strong, silent men who often dealt awkwardly with women. \"The Sun Also Rises\" and \"A Farewell to Arms\" are generally considered his best novels; in 1954, he won the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nWilliam Faulkner (1897–1962) won the Nobel Prize in 1949, after Hitler was defeated in World War II: Faulkner encompassed an enormous range of humanity in Yoknapatawpha County, a Mississippian region of his own invention. He recorded his characters' seemingly unedited ramblings in order to represent their inner states, a technique called \"stream of consciousness\". (In fact, these passages are carefully crafted, and their seemingly chaotic structure conceals multiple layers of meaning.) He also jumbled time sequences to show how the past – especially the slave-holding era of the Deep South – endures in the present. Among his great works are \"Absalom, Absalom!\", \"As I Lay Dying\", \"The Sound and the Fury\", and \"Light in August\".\n\nAlthough the American theatrical tradition can be traced back to the arrival of Lewis Hallam's troupe in the mid-18th century and was very active in the 19th century, as seen by the popularity of minstrel shows and of adaptations of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\", American drama attained international status only in the 1920s and 1930s, with the works of Eugene O'Neill, who won four Pulitzer Prizes and the Nobel Prize.\n\nIn the middle of the 20th century, American drama was dominated by the work of playwrights Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller, as well as by the maturation of the American musical, which had found a way to integrate script, music and dance in such works as \"Oklahoma!\" and \"West Side Story\". Later American playwrights of importance include Edward Albee, Sam Shepard, David Mamet, August Wilson and Tony Kushner.\n\nDepression era literature was blunt and direct in its social criticism. John Steinbeck (1902–1968) was born in Salinas, California, where he set many of his stories. His style was simple and evocative, winning him the favor of the readers but not of the critics. Steinbeck often wrote about poor, working-class people and their struggle to lead a decent and honest life. \"The Grapes of Wrath\", considered his masterpiece, is a strong, socially-oriented novel that tells the story of the Joads, a poor family from Oklahoma and their journey to California in search of a better life.\n\nOther popular novels include \"Tortilla Flat\", \"Of Mice and Men\", \"Cannery Row\", and \"East of Eden\". He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962. Steinbeck's contemporary, Nathanael West's two most famous short novels, \"Miss Lonelyhearts,\" which plumbs the life of its eponymous antihero, a reluctant (and, to comic effect, male) advice columnist, and the effects the tragic letters exert on it, and \"The Day of the Locust\", which introduces a cast of Hollywood stereotypes and explores the ironies of the movies, have come to be avowed classics of American literature.\n\nIn non-fiction, James Agee's \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\" observes and depicts the lives of three struggling tenant-farming families in Alabama in 1936. Combining factual reporting with poetic beauty, Agee presented an accurate and detailed report of what he had seen coupled with insight into his feelings about the experience and the difficulties of capturing it for a broad audience. In doing so, he created an enduring portrait of a nearly invisible segment of the American population.\n\nHenry Miller assumed a unique place in American Literature in the 1930s when his semi-autobiographical novels, written and published in Paris, were banned from the US. Although his major works, including \"Tropic of Cancer\" and \"Black Spring\", would not be free of the label of obscenity until 1962, their themes and stylistic innovations had already exerted a major influence on succeeding generations of American writers, and paved the way for sexually frank 1960s novels by John Updike, Philip Roth, Gore Vidal, John Rechy and William Styron.\n\nThe period in time from the end of World War II up until, roughly, the late 1960s and early 1970s saw the publication of some of the most popular works in American history such as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee. The last few of the more realistic modernists along with the wildly Romantic beatniks largely dominated the period, while the direct respondents to America's involvement in World War II contributed in their notable influence.\n\nThough born in Canada, Chicago-raised Saul Bellow would become one of the most influential novelists in America in the decades directly following World War II. In works like \"The Adventures of Augie March\" and \"Herzog\", Bellow painted vivid portraits of the American city and the distinctive characters that peopled it. Bellow went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1976.\n\nFrom J.D. Salinger's \"Nine Stories\" and \"The Catcher in the Rye\" to Sylvia Plath's \"The Bell Jar\", the perceived madness of the state of affairs in America was brought to the forefront of the nation's literary expression. Immigrant authors such as Vladimir Nabokov, with \"Lolita\", forged on with the theme, and, at almost the same time, the beatniks took a concerted step away from their Lost Generation predecessors, developing a style and tone of their own by drawing on Eastern theology and experimenting with recreational drugs.\n\nThe poetry and fiction of the \"Beat Generation\", largely born of a circle of intellects formed in New York City around Columbia University and established more officially some time later in San Francisco, came of age. The term \"Beat\" referred, all at the same time, to the countercultural rhythm of the Jazz scene, to a sense of rebellion regarding the conservative stress of post-war society, and to an interest in new forms of spiritual experience through drugs, alcohol, philosophy, and religion, and specifically through Zen Buddhism.\n\nAllen Ginsberg set the tone of the movement in his poem \"Howl\", a Whitmanesque work that began: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness...\" Among the most representative achievements of the Beats in the novel are Jack Kerouac's \"On the Road\" (1957), the chronicle of a soul-searching travel through the continent, and William S. Burroughs's \"Naked Lunch\" (1959), a more experimental work structured as a series of vignettes relating, among other things, the narrator's travels and experiments with hard drugs.\n\nRegarding the war novel specifically, there was a literary explosion in America during the post–World War II era. Some of the best known of the works produced included Norman Mailer's \"The Naked and the Dead\" (1948), Joseph Heller's \"Catch-22\" (1961) and Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s \"Slaughterhouse-Five\" (1969). \"The Moviegoer\" (1962), by Southern author Walker Percy, winner of the National Book Award, was his attempt at exploring \"the dislocation of man in the modern age.\"\n\nIn contrast, John Updike approached American life from a more reflective but no less subversive perspective. His 1960 novel \"Rabbit, Run,\" the first of four chronicling the rising and falling fortunes of Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom over the course of four decades against the backdrop of the major events of the second half of the 20th century, broke new ground on its release in its characterization and detail of the American middle class and frank discussion of taboo topics such as adultery. Notable among Updike's characteristic innovations was his use of present-tense narration, his rich, stylized language, and his attention to sensual detail. His work is also deeply imbued with Christian themes. The two final installments of the Rabbit series, \"Rabbit is Rich\" (1981) and \"Rabbit at Rest\" (1990), were both awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Other notable works include the Henry Bech novels (1970–98), \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1984), \"Roger's Version\" (1986) and \"In the Beauty of the Lilies\" (1996), which literary critic Michiko Kakutani called \"arguably his finest.\"\n\nFrequently linked with Updike is the novelist Philip Roth. Roth vigorously explores Jewish identity in American society, especially in the postwar era and the early 21st century. Frequently set in Newark, New Jersey, Roth's work is known to be highly autobiographical, and many of Roth's main characters, most famously the Jewish novelist Nathan Zuckerman, are thought to be alter egos of Roth. With these techniques, and armed with his articulate and fast-paced style, Roth explores the distinction between reality and fiction in literature while provocatively examining American culture. His most famous work includes the Zuckerman novels, the controversial \"Portnoy's Complaint\" (1969), and \"Goodbye, Columbus\" (1959). Among the most decorated American writers of his generation, he has won every major American literary award, including the Pulitzer Prize for his major novel \"American Pastoral\" (1997).\n\nIn the realm of African-American literature, Ralph Ellison's 1952 novel \"Invisible Man\" was instantly recognized as among the most powerful and important works of the immediate post-war years. The story of a black Underground Man in the urban north, the novel laid bare the often repressed racial tension that still prevailed while also succeeding as an existential character study. Richard Wright was catapulted to fame by the publication in subsequent years of his now widely studied short story, \"The Man Who Was Almost a Man\" (1939), and his controversial second novel, \"Native Son\" (1940), and his legacy was cemented by the 1945 publication of \"Black Boy\", a work in which Wright drew on his childhood and mostly autodidactic education in the segregated South, fictionalizing and exaggerating some elements as he saw fit. Because of its polemical themes and Wright's involvement with the Communist Party, the novel's final part, \"American Hunger,\" was not published until 1977.\n\nPerhaps the most ambitious and challenging post-war American novelist was William Gaddis, whose uncompromising, satiric, and large novels, such as \"The Recognitions\" (1955) and \"J R\" (1975) are presented largely in terms of unattributed dialog that requires almost unexampled reader participation. Gaddis's primary themes include forgery, capitalism, religious zealotry, and the legal system, constituting a sustained polyphonic critique of modern American life. Gaddis's work, though largely ignored for years, anticipated and influenced the development of such ambitious \"postmodern\" fiction writers as Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace, Joseph McElroy, William H. Gass, and Don DeLillo. Another neglected and challenging postwar American novelist, albeit one who wrote much shorter works, was John Hawkes, whose surreal visionary fiction addresses themes of violence and eroticism and experiments audaciously with narrative voice and style. Among his most important works is the short nightmarish novel \"The Lime Twig\" (1961).\n\nIn the postwar period, the art of the short story again flourished. Among its most respected practitioners was Flannery O'Connor, who developed a distinctive Southern gothic esthetic in which characters acted at one level as people and at another as symbols. A devout Catholic, O'Connor often imbued her stories, among them the widely studied \"A Good Man is Hard to Find\" and \"Everything That Rises Must Converge\", and two novels, \"Wise Blood\" (1952); \"The Violent Bear It Away\" (1960), with deeply religious themes, focusing particularly on the search for truth and religious skepticism against the backdrop of the nuclear age. Other important practitioners of the form include Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty, John Cheever, Raymond Carver, Tobias Wolff, and the more experimental Donald Barthelme.\n\nAmong the most respected of the postwar American poets are John Ashbery, the key figure of the surrealistic New York School of poetry, and his celebrated \"Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror\" (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1976); Elizabeth Bishop and her \"North & South\" (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1956) and \"Geography III\" (National Book Award, 1970); Richard Wilbur and his \"Things of This World,\" winner of both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for Poetry in 1957; John Berryman and his \"The Dream Songs\", (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1964, National Book Award, 1968); A.R. Ammons, whose \"Collected Poems 1951-1971\" won a National Book Award in 1973 and whose long poem \"Garbage\" earned him another in 1993; Theodore Roethke and his \"The Waking\" (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1954); James Merrill and his epic poem of communication with the dead, \"The Changing Light at Sandover\" (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1977); Louise Glück for her \"The Wild Iris\" (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1993); W.S. Merwin for his \"The Carrier of Ladders\" (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1971) and \"The Shadow of Sirius\" (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 2009); Mark Strand for \"Blizzard of One\" (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1999); Robert Hass for his \"Time and Materials,\" which won both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award for Poetry in 2008 and 2007 respectively; and Rita Dove for her \"Thomas and Beulah\" (Pulitzer Prize for Poetry, 1987).\n\nIn addition, in this same period the confessional, whose origin is often traced to the publication in 1959 of Robert Lowell's \"Life Studies\", and beat schools of poetry enjoyed popular and academic success, producing such widely anthologized voices as Allen Ginsberg, Charles Bukowski, Gary Snyder, Anne Sexton, and Sylvia Plath, among many others.\n\nThough its exact parameters remain disputable, from the early 1970s to the present day the most salient literary movement has been postmodernism. Thomas Pynchon, a seminal practitioner of the form, drew in his work on modernist fixtures such as temporal distortion, unreliable narrators, and internal monologue and coupled them with distinctly postmodern techniques such as metafiction, ideogrammatic characterization, unrealistic names (Oedipa Maas, Benny Profane, etc.), absurdist plot elements and hyperbolic humor, deliberate use of anachronisms and archaisms, a strong focus on postcolonial themes, and a subversive commingling of high and low culture. In 1973, he published \"Gravity's Rainbow\", a leading work in this genre, which won the National Book Award and was unanimously nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction that year. His other major works include his debut, \"V.\" (1963), \"The Crying of Lot 49\" (1966), \"Mason & Dixon\" (1997), and \"Against the Day\" (2006).\n\nToni Morrison, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature, writing in a distinctive lyrical prose style, published her controversial debut novel, \"The Bluest Eye\", to critical acclaim in 1970. Coming on the heels of the signing of the Civil Rights Act of 1965, the novel, widely studied in American schools, includes an elaborate description of incestuous rape and explores the conventions of beauty established by a historically racist society, painting a portrait of a self-immolating black family in search of beauty in whiteness. Since then, Morrison has experimented with lyric fantasy, as in her two best-known later works, \"Song of Solomon\" (1977) and \"Beloved\" (1987), for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction; along these lines, critic Harold Bloom has drawn favorable comparisons to Virginia Woolf, and the Nobel committee to \"Faulkner and to the Latin American tradition [of magical realism].\" \"Beloved\" was chosen in a 2006 survey conducted by \"The New York Times\" as the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years.\n\nWriting in a lyrical, flowing style that eschews excessive use of the comma and semicolon, recalling William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway in equal measure, Cormac McCarthy seizes on the literary traditions of several regions of the United States and includes multiple genres. He writes in the Southern Gothic aesthetic in his Faulknerian 1965 debut, \"The Orchard Keeper\", and \"Suttree\" (1979); in the Epic Western tradition, with grotesquely drawn characters and symbolic narrative turns reminiscent of Melville, in \"Blood Meridian\" (1985), which Harold Bloom styled \"the greatest single book since Faulkner's \"As I Lay Dying\",\" calling the character of Judge Holden \"short of Moby Dick, the most monstrous apparition in all of American literature\"; in a much more pastoral tone in his celebrated Border Trilogy (1992–98) of \"bildungsromans\", including \"All the Pretty Horses\" (1992), winner of the National Book Award; and in the post-apocalyptic genre in the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"The Road\" (2007). His novels are noted for achieving both commercial and critical success, several of his works having been adapted to film.\n\nDon DeLillo, who rose to literary prominence with the publication of his 1985 novel, \"White Noise\", a work broaching the subjects of death and consumerism and doubling as a piece of comic social criticism, began his writing career in 1971 with \"Americana\". He is listed by Harold Bloom as being among the preeminent contemporary American writers, in the company of such figures as Philip Roth, Cormac McCarthy, and Thomas Pynchon. His 1997 novel \"Underworld\" chronicles American life through and immediately after the Cold War and is usually considered his masterpiece. It was also the runner-up in a survey that asked writers to identify the most important work of fiction of the last 25 years. Among his other important novels are \"Libra\" (1988), \"Mao II\" (1991) and \"Falling Man\" (2007).\nSeizing on the distinctly postmodern techniques of digression, narrative fragmentation and elaborate symbolism, and strongly influenced by the works of Thomas Pynchon, David Foster Wallace began his writing career with \"The Broom of the System\", published to moderate acclaim in 1987. His second novel, \"Infinite Jest\" (1997), a futuristic portrait of America and a playful critique of the media-saturated nature of American life, has been consistently ranked among the most important works of the 20th century, and his final novel, unfinished at the time of his death, The Pale King (2011), has garnered much praise and attention. In addition to his novels, he also authored three acclaimed short story collections: \"Girl with Curious Hair\" (1989), \"Brief Interviews with Hideous Men\" (1999) and \"\" (2004).\n\nJonathan Franzen, Wallace's friend and contemporary, rose to prominence after the 2001 publication of his National Book Award-winning third novel, \"The Corrections\". He began his writing career in 1988 with the well-received \"The Twenty-Seventh City\", a novel centering on his native St. Louis, but did not gain national attention until the publication of his essay, \"Perchance to Dream,\" in Harper's Magazine, discussing the cultural role of the writer in the new millennium through the prism of his own frustrations. \"The Corrections\", a tragicomedy about the disintegrating Lambert family, has been called \"the literary phenomenon of [its] decade\" and was ranked as one of the greatest novels of the past century. In 2010, he published \"Freedom\" to great critical acclaim.\n\nOther notable writers at the turn of the century include Michael Chabon, whose Pulitzer Prize-winning \"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\" (2000) tells the story of two friends, Joe Kavalier and Sam Clay, as they rise through the ranks of the comics industry in its heyday; Denis Johnson, whose 2007 novel \"Tree of Smoke\" about falsified intelligence during Vietnam both won the National Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and was called by critic Michiko Kakutani \"one of the classic works of literature produced by [the Vietnam War]\"; and Louise Erdrich, whose 2008 novel \"The Plague of Doves\", a distinctly Faulknerian, polyphonic examination of the tribal experience set against the backdrop of murder in the fictional town of Pluto, North Dakota, was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and her 2012 novel \"The Round House\", which builds on the same themes, was awarded the 2012 National Book Award.\n\nOne of the developments in late-20th-century American literature was the increase of literature written by and about ethnic minorities beyond African Americans and Jewish Americans. This development came alongside the growth of the Civil Rights movements and its corollary, the Ethnic Pride movement, which led to the creation of Ethnic Studies programs in most major universities. These programs helped establish the new ethnic literature as worthy objects of academic study, alongside such other new areas of literary study as women's literature, gay and lesbian literature, working-class literature, postcolonial literature, and the rise of literary theory as a key component of academic literary study.\n\nAfter being relegated to cookbooks and autobiographies for most of the 20th century, Asian American literature achieved widespread notice through Maxine Hong Kingston's fictional memoir, \"The Woman Warrior\" (1976), and her novels \"China Men\" (1980) and \"Tripmaster Monkey: His Fake Book\". Chinese-American author Ha Jin in 1999 won the National Book Award for his second novel, \"Waiting\", about a Chinese soldier in the Revolutionary Army who has to wait 18 years to divorce his wife for another woman, all the while having to worry about persecution for his protracted affair, and twice won the PEN/Faulkner Award, in 2000 for \"Waiting\" and in 2005 for \"War Trash\".\n\nIndian-American author Jhumpa Lahiri won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for her debut collection of short stories, \"Interpreter of Maladies\" (1999), and went on to write a well-received novel, \"The Namesake\" (2003), which was shortly adapted to film in 2007. In her second collection of stories, \"Unaccustomed Earth\", released to widespread commercial and critical success, Lahiri shifts focus and treats the experiences of the second and third generation.\n\nOther notable Asian-American novelists include Amy Tan, best known for her novel, \"The Joy Luck Club\" (1989), tracing the lives of four immigrant families brought together by the game of Mahjong, and Korean American novelist Chang-Rae Lee, who has published \"Native Speaker\", \"A Gesture Life,\" and \"Aloft.\" Such poets as Marilyn Chin and Li-Young Lee, Kimiko Hahn and Janice Mirikitani have also achieved prominence, as has playwright David Henry Hwang. Equally important has been the effort to recover earlier Asian American authors, started by Frank Chin and his colleagues; this effort has brought Sui Sin Far, Toshio Mori, Carlos Bulosan, John Okada, Hisaye Yamamoto and others to prominence.\n\nHispanic literature also became important during this period, starting with acclaimed novels by Tomás Rivera (\"...y no se lo tragó la tierra\") and Rudolfo Anaya (\"Bless Me, Ultima\"), and the emergence of Chicano theater with Luis Valdez and \"Teatro Campesino\". Latina writing became important thanks to authors such as Sandra Cisneros, an icon of an emerging Chicano literature whose 1984 bildungsroman \"The House on Mango Street\" is taught in schools across the United States, Denise Chavez's \"The Last of the Menu Girls\" and Gloria Anzaldúa's \"\".\n\nDominican-American author Junot Díaz, received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his 2007 novel \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\", which tells the story of an overweight Dominican boy growing up as a social outcast in Paterson, New Jersey. Another Dominican author, Julia Alvarez, is well known for \"How the García Girls Lost Their Accents\" and \"In the Time of the Butterflies\". Cuban American author Oscar Hijuelos won a Pulitzer for \"The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love\", and Cristina García received acclaim for \"Dreaming in Cuban.\"\n\nCelebrated Puerto Rican novelists who write in English and Spanish include Giannina Braschi, author of the Spanglish classic Yo-Yo Boing! and Rosario Ferré, best known for \"Eccentric Neighborhoods\" Puerto Rico has also produced important playwrights such as René Marqués, Luis Rafael Sánchez, and José Rivera and New York based poets such as Julia de Burgos, Giannina Braschi and Pedro Pietri, as well as various members of the Nuyorican Poets Café.\n\nSpurred by the success of N. Scott Momaday's Pulitzer Prize–winning \"House Made of Dawn\", Native American literature showed explosive growth during this period, known as the Native American Renaissance, through such novelists as Leslie Marmon Silko (e.g., \"Ceremony\"), Gerald Vizenor (e.g., \"\" and numerous essays on Native American literature), Louise Erdrich (\"Love Medicine\" and several other novels that use a recurring set of characters and locations in the manner of William Faulkner), James Welch (e.g., \"Winter in the Blood\"), Sherman Alexie (e.g., \"The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven\"), and poets Simon Ortiz and Joy Harjo. The success of these authors has brought renewed attention to earlier generations, including Zitkala-Sa, John Joseph Mathews, D'Arcy McNickle and Mourning Dove.\n\nMore recently, Arab American literature, largely unnoticed since the New York Pen League of the 1920s, has become more prominent through the work of Diana Abu-Jaber, whose novels include \"Arabian Jazz\" and \"Crescent\" and the memoir \"The Language of Baklava\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was one of the central figures of the Albanian language studies and founding member and director of the Albanian Institute of History and Linguistics, and later Institute of Linguistics and Literature (Alb: \"Instituti i Gjuhësisë dhe Letërsisë\"). Kostallari is remembered for being one of the key expert contributor to the present Albanian language orthography established by the Congress of Orthography of 1972.\n\nKostallari was born in Leusë near Përmet. He pursued his high school studies in Shkodër and later in Tiranë. An active participant of the National Liberation Movement during World War II, he worked in the post-war press-organs where he succeeded in management positions though at a young age. \n<br> He studied philology in the Lomonosov Moscow State University, where he studied Russian language and literature profiling in journalism, and graduating in 1954. Upon his return in Albania he started working in the Institute of Sciences (Alb: \"Instituti i Shkencave\"), a precursor of the Academy of Sciences of Albania, and later in the Faculty of History and Philology of the newly founded University of Tirana where he would later reach the position of the dean.\n<br>In 1958, he was elected as Director of the Institute of History and Linguistics (Alb: \"Instituti i Historisë dhe i Gjuhësisë\") of Tirana, and after it was restructured, the Institute of Linguistics and Literature (Alb: \"Instituti i Gjuhësisë dhe i Letërsisë\") until 1990. He served as editor-in-chief of the \"Studime filologjike\" magazine during 1964–1991, and \"Studia albanica\" during 1964–1980.

While the use of religious art gradually came to be accepted by the mainstream, its rejection within certain limits remained a constant throughout the Middle Ages. In the twelfth century, certain elements within reform monasticism (especially the Cistercians but also others) saw the use of art by monks as inappropriate for a number of reasons. Criticism of the use of monastic art was seen as a criticism of the greatest patrons of religious art of the time, traditional Benedictine monasticism (virtually all of the greatest medieval art up until this time had been religious). Since traditional Benedictine monasticism was one of the richest and most influential segments of society—and since art was one of the great vehicles of interaction between traditional monasticism and the lay public, this interaction being an important source of wealth for monasticism—the controversy over art that arose involved far more than aesthetic questions.\n\nThe \"Apologia\" is the most articulate document we have for this controversy and one of the most important in understanding how medieval art was used and perceived. In it, Bernard takes up five major criticisms of the use of monastic art.\n\nPerhaps Bernard's harshest criticism of the monastic use of art addresses the economic base of monastic art production: the monastic investment in art for the purpose of attracting donations from the visiting public. In doing so, he takes up a number of different themes such as the justification of investing in art, art for the honor of God, the relation between material and spiritual prosperity, and the financial necessity of pilgrimage art.\n\nIn discussing the artistic means by which the investment in art was carried out, Bernard particularly criticizes excess in art, focusing especially on excess in material, craftsmanship, size, and quantity. In this criticism, what he most objects to is not monumental sculpture and painting but rather liturgical art, that is, works often of gold, silver, and jewels that were used in the liturgy and often in the Cult of Relics.\n\nIn his critique of the reception of art on the part of the general public, Bernard took up the indispensable element of medieval pilgrimage art: the equation between excessive art and holiness, that is, the use of excessive art in order to create a sense of \"praesentia\" (the physical presence of the holy).\n\nFollowing in the patristic tradition, Bernard also sees art as in opposition to the care of the poor, his most significant social objection external to monasticism properly speaking.\n\nOne of Bernard's most important criticisms of the monastic use of art is that of art as a spiritual distraction to the monk. Aside from simple distraction, this criticism includes such dangers to the medieval monk as curiosity and materiality.\n\nWhile the traditional view has been that the \"Apologia\" was directed at the art of the monastery of Cluny in particular and that of other offending Cluniac and traditional Benedictine monasteries in general, more recent scholarship has shown that the \"Apologia\" was instead directed at not only all of traditional monasticism but also marginal traditional Benedictine monasteries, the new ascetic orders (Carthusians, Gilbertines, Premonstratensians, and so on), and Bernard's own Cistercian Order.\n\n"}
{"id": "185508", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185508", "title": "Balafon", "text": "Balafon\n\nThe balafon is a kind of xylophone or percussion idiophone which plays melodic tunes, and usually has between 16 and 27 keys. It has been played in Africa since the 12th century according to oral stories; it originated in Mali, according to the Manding history narrated by the griots.\n\nBelieved to have been developed independently of the Southern African and South American instrument now called the marimba, oral histories of the balafon date it to at least the rise of the Mali Empire in the 12th century CE. Balafon is a Manding name, but variations exist across West Africa, including the \"balangi\" in Sierra Leone and the gyil of the Dagara, Lobi and Gurunsi from Ghana, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast. Similar instruments are played in parts of Central Africa, with the ancient Kingdom of Kongo denoting the instrument as \"palaku\".\n\nRecords of the balafon go back to at least the 12th century CE. In 1352 CE, Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta reported the existence of the ngoni and balafon at the court of Malian ruler Mansa Suleiman.\n\nEuropean visitors to West Africa described balafons in the 17th century largely identical to the modern instrument. The Atlantic Slave Trade brought some balafon players to the Americas. The \"Virginia Gazette\" records African-Americans playing a \"barrafoo\" in 1776, which appears to be a balafon. Other North American references to these instruments die out by the mid-19th century.\n\nThe balafon has seen a resurgence since the 1980s in the growth of African Roots Music and World Music. Most famous of these exponents is the Rail Band, led by Salif Keita. Even when not still played, its distinctive sound and traditional style has been exported to western instruments. Maninka from eastern Guinea play a type of guitar music that adapts balafon playing style to the imported instrument.\n\n in the Malinké language \"balafon\" is a compound of two words: \"balan\" is the name of the instrument and \"fô\" is the verb \"to play\". Balafon therefore is really the act of \"playing the bala\".\n\n\"Bala\" still is used as the name of a large bass balafon in the region of Kolokani and Bobo Dioulasso. These \"bala\" have especially long keys and huge calabashes for amplification. \"Balani\" is then used as the name of the high pitched, small balafon with small calabashes and short (3 to 4 cm long) keys. The \"balani\" is carried with a strap and usually has 21 keys, while the number of keys on a \"bala\" vary with region.\n\nA balafon can be either \"fixed-key\" (where the keys are strung over a fixed frame, usually with calabash resonators underneath) or \"free-key\" (where the keys are placed independently on any padded surface). The balafon usually has 17-21 keys, tuned to a tetratonic, pentatonic or heptatonic scale, depending on the culture of the musician.\n\nThe balafon is generally capable of producing 18 to 21 notes, though some are built to produce many fewer notes (16, 12, 8 or even 6 and 7). Balafon keys are traditionally made from béné wood, dried slowly over a low flame, and then tuned by shaving off bits of wood from the underside of the keys. Wood is taken off the middle to flatten the key or the end to sharpen it.\n\nIn a \"fixed-key\" balafon, the keys are suspended by leather straps just above a wooden frame, under which are hung graduated-size calabash gourd resonators. A small hole in each gourd is covered with a membrane traditionally of thin spider's-egg sac filaments (nowadays more usually of cigarette paper or thin plastic film) to produce the characteristic nasal-buzz timbre of the instrument, which is usually played with two gum-rubber-wound mallets while seated on a low stool (or while standing using a shoulder or waist sling hooked to its frame).\n\nAs the balafon cultures vary across West Africa, so does the approach to the instrument itself. In many areas the balafon is played alone in a ritual context, in others as part of an ensemble. In Guinea and Mali, the balafon is often part of an ensemble of three, pitched low, medium and high. In Cameroon, six balafon of varying size perform together in an orchestra, called a \"komenchang\". An Igbo variation exists with only one large tuned key for each player. And while in most cases a single player hits multiple keys with two mallets, some traditions place two or more players at each keyboard.\n\nThe Susu and Malinké people of Guinea are closely identified with the balafon, as are the other Manding peoples of Mali, Senegal, and the Gambia. Cameroon, Chad, and even the nations of the Congo Basin have a long balafon traditions.\n\nOften, balafon players will wear belled bracelets on each wrist, accentuating the sound of the keys.\n\nIn some cultures the balafon was (and in some still is) a sacred instrument, playable only by trained religious caste members and only at ritual events such as festivals, royal, funerial, or marriage celebrations. Here the balafon is kept in a temple storehouse, and can only be removed and played after undergoing purification rites. Specific instruments may be built to be only played for specific rituals and repertoires. Young adepts are trained not on the sacred instrument, but on \"free-key\" pit balafons.\n\nThe gyil ( or ) is the name of a buzzing pentatonic balafon common to the Gur-speaking populations in northern Ghana, Burkina Faso, southeastern Mali and northern Ivory Coast in West Africa. Among Mande populations in Ghana like the Ligbi (Numu), Bissa and Dyula, the same instrument is known as \"bala\". The gyil is the primary traditional instrument of the Dagara people of northern Ghana and Burkina Faso, and of the Lobi of Ghana, southern Burkina Faso, and Ivory Coast. The gyil is usually played in pairs, accompanied by a calabash gourd drum called a \"kuor\". It can also be played by one person with the drum and the stick part as accompaniment, or by a soloist. Gyil duets are the traditional music of Dagara funerals. The instrument is generally played by men, who learn to play while young; however, there is no restriction on gender. It is also played by the Gurunsi people of the Upper East Region of Ghana, as well as neighbouring Gurunsi populations across the border in south and central Burkina Faso. A dance related to the gyil is the Bewaa.\n\nThe gyil's design is similar to the \"balaba\" or balafon used by the Mande-speaking Bambara, Dyula and Sosso peoples further west in southern Mali and western Burkina Faso, as well as the Senoufo people of Sikasso, a region that shares many musical traditions with those of northern Ivory Coast and Ghana. It is made with 14 wooden keys of an African hardwood called liga attached to a wooden frame, below which hang calabash gourds. Spider web silk covers small holes in the gourds to produce a buzzing sound and antelope sinew and leather are used for the fastenings. The instrument is played with rubber-headed wooden mallets.\n\nDuring the 1950s, bars sprang up across Cameroon's capital to accommodate an influx of new inhabitants, and soon became a symbol for Cameroonian identity in the face of colonialism. Balafon orchestras, consisting of 3-5 balafons and various percussion instruments became common in these bars. Some of these orchestras, such as Richard Band de Zoetele, became quite popular in spite of scorn from the European elite.\n\nThe middle of the 20th century saw the popularisation of a native folk music called bikutsi. Bikutsi is based on a war rhythm played with various rattles, drums and balafon. Sung by women, bikutsi featured sexually explicit lyrics and songs about everyday problems. In a popularised form, bikutsi gained mainstream success in the 1950s. Anne-Marie Nzie was perhaps the most important of the early innovators The next bikutsi performer of legendary stature was Messi Me Nkonda Martin and his band, Los Camaroes, who added electric guitars and other new elements.\n\nBalafon orchestras had remained popular throughout the 50s in Yaoundé's bar scene, but the audience demanded modernity and the popular style at the time was unable to cope. Messi Martin was a Cameroonian guitarist who had been inspired to learn the instrument by listening to Spanish language-broadcasts from neighboring Equatorial Guinea, as well as Cuban and Zairean rumba. Messi changed the electric guitar by linking the strings together with pieces of paper, thus giving the instrument a damper tone that emitted a \"thudding\" sound similar to the balafon.\n\nThe balafon, kora (lute-harp), and the ngoni (the ancestor of the banjo) are the three instruments most associated with griot bardic traditions of West Africa. Each is more closely associated with specific areas, communities, and traditions, though all are played together in ensembles throughout the region. Guinea has been the historic heartland of solo balafon. As griot culture is a hereditary caste, the Kouyaté family has been called the \"keepers of the balafon\", and twentieth century members of this family have helped introduce it throughout the world.\n\nThe Sosso Bala is a balafon, currently kept in the town of Niagassola, Guinea that is reputed to be \"the\" original balafon, constructed over 800 years ago. The Epic of Sundiata, a story of the formation of the Mali Empire, tells that a griot named Bala Faséké Kouyaté convinced Sosso king Sumanguru Kante to employ him after sneaking into Sumanguru's palace and playing the sacred instrument. Sundiata Keita, founder of the Mali Empire overthrew Sumanguru, seized the balafon, and made the griot Faséké its guardian. This honor is said to have passed down through his family, the Kouyatés, and conveys upon them mastership of the balafon to this day.\n\nRegardless of the truth of this story, the Sosso Bala is an instrument of great age, and was named by UNESCO as one of the Nineteen Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001.\n\nThe title of the Senegalese National Anthem is \"Pincez Tous vos Koras, Frappez les Balafons\" (\"Everyone strum your koras, strike the balafons\").\n\nA modern festival devoted to the balafon, the Triangle du balafon, now takes place annually at Sikasso in Mali.\n\nFamous balafon players have included:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It forms part of the series of \"unfinished\" Prigioni intended for the Tomb of Pope Julius II.\n\nIt seems that, from the first design of the Tomb of Pope Julius II (1505), a series of \"Prigioni\" was planned for the bottom level of the mausoleum, a series of statues larger than life size of chained figures in various poses, leaning on pilasters which would frame niches containing winged Victories and be surmounted by herms. With a pair on each side of each niche, there must initially have been sixteen or twenty such statues planned. This number was reduced in successive designs, to twelve (second version, 1513), eight (third version, 1516) and finally maybe only four (fourth version, 1526, or fifth version, 1532), before being eliminated from the project altogether in the final version of 1542.\n\nThe first members of the series, who are mentioned in Michelangelo's letters are the two \"Prigioni\" of Paris, named the \"Slaves\" in the nineteenth century: the \"Dying Slave\" and the \"Rebellious Slave\". They were carved in Rome around 1513.\n\nThe Florentine \"Prigioni\" (\"Young Slave, Bearded Slave, Atlas Slave\" and the \"Awakening Slave\") were probably carved instead in the second half of the 1520s, while Michelangelo was employed at San Lorenzo in Florence (but historians suggest dates between 1519 and 1534). It is known that they were in the artist's warehouse on the via Mozza in 1544, when his nephew Leonardo Buonarroti asked permission to sell them (Michelangelo did not visit Florence after 1534). The permission was denied and only in 1564 were they donated, along with \"the Genius of Victory\", to the Grand Duke Cosimo I who placed them at the four corners of the Grotto of Buontalenti in 1591. They were removed from there in 1908, in order to be reunited with other works of Michelangelo in the Florentine gallery.\n\nWith respect to the exact date, Justi (and others) propose 1519, on the basis of a letter of 13 February, in which Jacopo Salviati promised the cardinal Aginesis, Julius II's heir, that the sculptor would have the four figures for the tomb ready by the summer of that year; Wilde proposes 1523, pointing to a statement of the cardinal Giulio de' Medici (the future Clement VII) who had seen them before he departed for Rome in that year; finally de Tolnay dates them to 1530–1534 on the basis on their style, frequent references to incomplete sculptures for the pope's tomb in letters of 1531–2 and Vasari's statement that they were created while the artist was preparing the cartoon of \"The Last Judgment\".\n\nThe \"Bearded Slave\" is the most finished of the Florentine \"Prigioni\" and gets his name from his thick, curly beard. The way his muscular torso twists indicates a deep knowledge of anatomy, typical of the best works of Michelangelo; his legs, slightly bent and separated, are covered by a band of fabric. His right arm is raised to hold his bent head, while his left hand remains unfinished, but seems to hold the band of fabric.\n\nThe whole surface retains many traces of the various chisels and scrapers used on the sculpture. Along his hips there is a repaired fracture, whose cause is unknown.\n\nIts unfinished state creates an extraordinary energy (already noted by Bocchi in 1591), with the figure caught in a sort of primordial act of freeing himself from the cage of the rough stone, an epic battle with the forces of chaos. The iconographic meaning of the figures was probably linked to the motif of the \"captivi\" in Roman art, and indeed Vasari identified the \"Prigioni\" as personifications of the provinces controlled by Julius II. For Condivi, however, they symbolised the Arts, made \"prisoners\" by the death of the pontif. Other scholars have made proposals of a philosophical/symbolic character or connected to the artist's personal life and his \"torments\".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5678514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5678514", "title": "Decadent movement", "text": "Decadent movement\n\nThe Decadent Movement was a late 19th-century artistic and literary movement, centered in Western Europe, that followed an aesthetic ideology of excess and artificiality. The visual artist Félicien Rops's body of work and Joris-Karl Huysmans's novel \"Against Nature\" (1884) are considered the prime examples of the decadent movement. It first flourished in France and then spread throughout Europe and to the United States. The movement was characterized by self-disgust, sickness at the world, general skepticism, delight in perversion and employment of crude humor and a belief in the superiority of human creativity over logic and the natural world.\n\nThe concept of decadence dates from the eighteenth century, especially from the writings of Montesquieu, the Enlightenment philosopher who suggested that the decline (\"décadence\") of the Roman Empire was in large part due to their moral decay and loss of cultural standards. When Latin scholar Désiré Nisard turned toward French literature, he compared Victor Hugo and Romanticism in general to the Roman decadence, men sacrificing their craft and their cultural values for the sake of pleasure. The trends that he identified, such as an interest in description, a lack of adherence to the conventional rules of literature and art, and a love for extravagant language were the seeds of the Decadent Movement.\n\nThe first major development in French decadence would come when writers Théophile Gautier and Charles Baudelaire used the word proudly, to represent a rejection of what they considered banal \"progress.\" Baudelaire referred to himself as decadent in his 1857 edition of \"Les Fleurs du Mal\" and exalted the Roman decline as a model for modern poets to express their passion. He would later use the term \"decadence\" to include the subversion of traditional categories in pursuit of full, sensual expression. In his lengthy introduction to Baudelaire in the front of the 1868 \"Les Fleurs du Mal,\" Gautier at first rejects the application of the term decadent, as meant by the critic, but then works his way to an admission of decadence on Baudelaire's own terms: a preference for what is beautiful and what is exotic, an ease with surrendering to fantasy, and a maturity of skill with manipulating language.\n\nThough he was Belgian, Félicien Rops was instrumental in the development of this early stage of the Decadent Movement. A friend of Baudelaire, he was also a frequent illustrator of Baudelaire's writing, at the request of the author himself. Rops delighted in breaking artistic convention and shocking the public with gruesome, fantastical horror. He was explicitly interested in the Satanic, and he frequently sought to portray the double-threat of Satan and Woman. At times, his only goal was the portrayal of a woman he'd observed debasing herself in the pursuit of her own pleasure. It has also been suggested that, no matter how horrific and perverse his images could be, Rops' invocation of supernatural elements was sufficient to keep Baudelaire situated in a spiritually-aware universe that maintained a cynical kind of hope, even if the poetry \"requires a strong stomach.\" Their work was the worship of beauty disguised as the worship of evil. For both of them, mortality and all manner of corruptions were always on their mind. The ability of Rops to see and portray the same world as they did, made him a popular illustrator for other decadent authors.\n\nThe concept of decadence lingered after that, but it wasn't until 1884 that Maurice Barrès referred to a particular group of writers as \"Decadents.\" He defined this group as those who had been influenced heavily by Baudelaire, though they were also influenced by Gothic novels and the poetry and fiction of Edgar Allan Poe. Many were associated with Symbolism, others with Aestheticism. The pursuit of these authors, according to Arthur Symons, was \"a desperate endeavor to give sensation, to flash the impression of the moment, to preserve the very heat and motion of life,\" and their achievement, as he saw it, was \"to be a disembodied voice, and yet the voice of a human soul.\"\n\nIn his 1884 decadent novel \"À Rebours (\"English, \"Against Nature\" or \"Against the Grain\"), Joris-Karl Huysmans overthrew the past, subordinated nature to the human creative will, and suggested the primacy of, but inherent disillusion in, pleasure. He also identified likely candidates for the core of the Decadent Movement, which he seemed to view Baudelaire as sitting above: Paul Verlaine, Tristan Corbière, Theodore Hannon, and Stéphane Mallarmé. His character Des Esseintes hailed these writers for their creativity and their craftsmanship, suggesting that they filled him with \"insidious delight\" as they used a \"secret language\" to explore \"twisted and precious ideas.\"\n\nNot only did \"Against Nature\" define an ideology and a literature, but it also created an influential perspective on visual art. The character of Des Esseintes explicitly heralded the work of Gustave Moreau, Jan Luyken, and Odilon Redon. None of these artists would have identified themselves as part of this movement. Nevertheless, the choice of these three established a decadent perspective on art which favored madness and irrationality, graphic violence, frank pessimism about cultural institutions, and a disregard for visual logic of the natural world. It has also been suggested that a dream vision that Des Esseintes describes is based on the series of satanic encounters painted by Félicien Rops.\n\nCapitalizing on the momentum of Huysmans' work, Anatole Baju founded the magazine \"Le Décadent\" in 1886, an effort to define and organize the Decadent Movement in a formal way. This group of writers did not only look to escape the boredom of the banal, but they also sought to shock, scandalize, and subvert the expectations and values of society, believing that such freedom and creative experimentation would better humanity.\n\nNot everyone was comfortable with Baju and \"Le Décadent,\" even including some who had been published in its pages. Rival writer Jean Moréas published his Symbolist Manifesto, largely to escape association with the Decadent Movement, despite their shared heritage. Moréas and Gustave Kahn, among others, formed rival publications to reinforce the distinction. Paul Verlaine embraced the label at first, applauding it as a brilliant marketing choice by Baju. After seeing his own words exploited and tiring of \"Le Décadent\" publishing works falsely attributed to Arthur Rimbaud, however, Verlaine came to sour on Baju personally, and he eventually rejected the label, as well.\n\nDecadence continued on in France, but it was limited largely to Anatole Baju and his followers, who refined their focus even further on perverse sexuality, material extravagance, and up-ending social expectations. Far-fetched plots were acceptable if they helped generate the desired moments of salacious experience or glorification of the morbid and grotesque. Writers who embraced the sort of decadence featured in \"Le Décadent\" include Albert Aurier, Rachilde, Pierre Vareilles, Miguel Fernandez, Jean Lorrain, and Laurent Tailhaide. Many of these authors did also publish symbolist works, however, and it unclear how strongly they would have identified with Baju as decadents.\n\nIn France, the Decadent Movement is often said to have begun with either Joris-Karl Huysmans' \"Against Nature\" (1884) or Baudelaire's \"Les Fleur du Mal\". This movement essentially gave way to Symbolism when \"Le Décadent\" closed down in 1889 and Anatole Baju turned toward politics and became associated with anarchy. A few writers continued the decadent tradition, such as Octave Mirbeau, but Decadence was no longer a recognized movement, let alone a force in literature or art.\n\nBeginning with the association of decadence with cultural decline, it is not uncommon to associate decadence in general with transitional times and their associated moods of pessimism and uncertainty. In France, the heart of the Decadent Movement was during the 1880s and 1890s, the time of fin de siècle, or end-of-the-century gloom. As part of that overall transition, many scholars of Decadence, such as David Weir, regard Decadence as a dynamic transition between Romanticism and Modernism, especially considering the decadent tendency to dehumanize and distort in the name of pleasure and fantasy.\n\nSymbolism has often been confused with the Decadent Movement. Arthur Symons, a British poet and literary critic contemporary with the movement, at one time considered Decadence in literature to be a parent category that included both Symbolism and Impressionism, as rebellions against realism. He defined this common, decadent thread as, \"an intense self-consciousness, a restless curiosity in research, an over-subtilizing refinement upon refinement, a spiritual and moral perversity.\" He referred to all such literature as, \"a new and beautiful and interesting disease.\" Later, however, he would go on to instead describe the Decadent Movement as an \"interlude, half a mock interlude\" that distracted critics from seeing and appreciating the larger and more important trend, which was the development of Symbolism.\n\nIt is true that the two groups share an ideological descent from Baudelaire and for a time they both considered themselves as part of one sphere of new, anti-establishment literature. They worked together and met together for quite a while, as if they were part of the same movement. Maurice Barrès referred to this group as decadents, but he also referred to one of them (Stéphane Mallarmé) as a symbolist. Even Jean Moréas used both terms for his own group of writers as late as 1885.\n\nOnly a year later, however, Jean Moréas wrote his Symbolist Manifesto to assert a difference between the symbolists with whom he allied himself and this the new group of decadents associated with Anatole Baju and \"Le Décadent\". Even after this, there was sufficient common ground of interest, method, and language to blur the lines more than the manifesto might have suggested.\n\nIn the world of visual arts, it can be even more difficult to distinguish decadence from symbolism. In fact, Stephen Romer has referred to Félicien Rops, Gustave Moreau, and Fernand Khnopff as \"Symbolist-Decadent painters and engravers.\"\n\nNevertheless, there are clear ideological differences between those who continued on as symbolists and those who have been called \"dissidents\" for remaining in the Decadent Movement. Often, there was little doubt that Baju and his group were producing work that was decadent, but there is frequently more question about the work of the symbolists.\n\nIn a website associated with Dr. Petra Dierkes-Thrun's Stanford University course, Oscar Wilde and the French Decadents (2014), a student named Reed created a blog post that is the basis for much of what follows.\n\nBoth groups reject the primacy of nature, but what that means for them is very different. Symbolism uses extensive natural imagery as a means to elevate the viewer to a plane higher than the banal reality of nature itself, as when Stéphane Mallarmé mixes descriptions of flowers and heavenly imagery to create a transcendent moment in \"Flowers.\"\n\nDecadence, in contrast, actually belittles nature in the name of artistry. In Huysmans’ \"Against Nature\", for instance, the main character Des Esseintes says of nature: “There is not one of her inventions, no matter how subtle or imposing it may be, which human genius cannot create . . . There can be no doubt about it: this eternal, driveling, old woman is no longer admired by true artists, and the moment has come to replace her by artifice.\"\n\nSymbolism treats language and imagery as devices that can only approximate meaning and merely evoke complex emotions and call the mind toward ideas it might not be able to comprehend. In the words of symbolist poet Stéphane Mallarmé:Languages are imperfect because multiple; the supreme language is missing... no one can utter words which would bear the miraculous stamp of Truth Herself Incarnate... how impossible it is for language to express things... in the Poet's hands... by the consistent virtue and necessity of an art which lives on fiction, it achieves its full efficacy.As Moréas would go on to assert in his manifest on symbolism, words and images serve to dress up the incomprehensible in such a way that it can be approached, if not understood.\n\nDecadence, on the other hand, sees no path to higher truth in words and images. Instead, books, poetry, and art itself as the creators of valid new worlds, thus the allegory of decadent Wilde's Dorian Gray being poisoned by a book like a drug. Words and artifice are the vehicles for human creativity, and Huysmans suggests that the illusions of fantasy have their own reality: \"The secret lies in knowing how to proceed, how to concentrate deeply enough to produce the hallucination and succeed in substituting the dream reality for the reality itself.\"\n\nBoth groups are disillusioned with the meaning and truth offered by the natural world, rational thought, and ordinary society. Symbolism turns its eyes toward Greater Purpose or on the Ideal, using dreams and symbols to approach these esoteric primal truths. In Mallarme's poem “Apparition”, for instance, the word “dreaming” appears twice, followed by “Dream” itself with a capital D. In “The Windows,” he speaks of this decadent disgust of contentment with comfort and an endless desire for the exotic. He writes: “So filled with disgust for the man whose soul is callous, sprawled in comforts where his hungering is fed.” In this continuing search for the spiritual, therefore, Symbolism has been predisposed to concern itself with purity and beauty and such mysterious imagery as those of fairies.\n\nIn contrast, Decadence says there is no oblique approach to ultimate truth, because there is no secret, mystical truth. They despise the very idea of searching for such a thing. If there is truth of value, it is purely in the sensual experience of the moment. The heroes of Decadent novels, for instance, have the unquenchable accumulation of luxuries and pleasure, often exotic, as their goal, would have space in its search for thrills for even the gory and the shocking. In \"The\" \"Temptation of Saint Anthony\", decadent Gustave Flaubert describes Saint Anthony's pleasure from watching disturbing scenes of horror. Later Czech decadent Arthur Breisky has been quoted by scholars as speaking to both the importance of illusion and of beauty: \"But isn’t it necessary to believe a beautiful mask more than reality?\"\n\nUltimately, the distinction may best be seen in their approach to art. Symbolism is an accumulation of “symbols” that are there not to present their content but to evoke greater ideas that their symbolism cannot expressly utter. According to Moréas, it is an attempt to connect the object and phenomena of the world to \"esoteric primordial truths\" that cannot ever be directly approached.\n\nDecadence, on the other hand, is an accumulation of signs or descriptions acting as detailed catalogs of human material riches as well as artifice. It was Oscar Wilde who perhaps lay this out most clearly in \"The Decay of Lying\" with the suggestion of three doctrines on art, here excerpted into a list:\nAfter which, he suggested a conclusion quite in contrast to Moréas' search for shadow truth: \"Lying, the telling of beautiful untrue things, is the proper aim of Art.\"\n\nIn France, the Decadent Movement could not withstand the loss of its leading figures. Many of those associated with the Decadent Movement became symbolists after initially associating freely with decadents. Paul Verlaine and Stéphane Mallarmé were among those, though both had been associated with Baju's \"Le Décadent\" for a time. Others kept a foot in each camp. Albert Aurier wrote decadent pieces for \"Le Décadent\" and also wrote symbolist poetry and art criticism. Decadent writer Rachilde was staunchly opposed to a symbolist take over of \"Le Décadent\" even though her own one-act drama \"The Crystal Spider\" is almost certainly a symbolist work. Others, once strong voices for decadence, abandoned the movement altogether. Joris-Karl Huysmans grew to consider \"Against Nature\" as the starting point on his journey into Roman Catholic symbolist work and the acceptance of hope. Anatole Baju, once the self-appointed school-master of French decadence, came to think of the movement as naive and half-hearted, willing to tinker and play with social realities, but not to utterly destroy them. He left decadence for anarchy.\n\nWhile the Decadent Movement, per se, was truly a French phenomenon, the impact was felt more broadly. Typically, the influence was felt as an interest in pleasure, an interest in experimental sexuality, and a fascination with the bizarre, all packaged with a somewhat trangressive spirit and an aesthetic that values material excess. Many were also influenced by the Decadent Movement's aesthetic emphasis on art for its own sake.\n\nBohemia\n\nCzech writers who were exposed to the work of the Decadent Movement saw in it the promise of a life they could never know. They were neither aristocrats nor bored bourgeoisie. They were poor and hungry for something better. The dreams of the decadents gave them that something better, but something that was hopelessly unattainable. It was that melancholy that drove their art. These Bohemian decadent writers included Karel Hlaváček, Arnošt Procházka, Jiří Karásek ze Lvovic, and Louisa Zikova. One Czech writer, Arthur Breisky, embraced the full spirit of \"Le Décadent\" with its exultation in material excess and a life of refinement and pleasure. From the Decadent Movement he learned the basic idea of a dandy, and his work is almost entirely focused on developing a philosophy in which the Dandy is the consummate human, surrounded by riches and elegance, theoretically above society, just as doomed to death and despair as they.\n\nBritain\nThough influenced through general exposure but also direct contact, the leading decadent figures in Britain associated with decadence were Irish writer Oscar Wilde, poet Algernon Charles Swinburne, and illustrator Aubrey Beardsley, as well as other artists and writers associated with \"The Yellow Book\". Others, such as Walter Pater, resisted association with the movement, even though their works seemed to reflect similar ideals. While most of the influence was from figures such as Baudelaire and Verlaine, there was also very strong influence at times from more purely decadent members of the French movement, such as the influence that Huysmans and Rachilde had on Wilde, as seen explicitly in \"The Picture of Dorian Gray\". British decadents embraced the idea of creating art for its own sake, pursuing all possible desires, and seeking material excess. At the same time, they were not shy about using the tools of decadence for social and political purpose. Beardsley had an explicit interest in the improvement of the social order and the role of art-as-experience in inspiring that transformation. Oscar Wilde published an entire work exploring socialism as a liberating force: \"Socialism would relieve us from that sordid necessity of living for others which, in the present condition of things, presses so hardly upon almost everybody.\" Swinburne wrote explicitly addressed Irish-English politics in poetry, as when he wrote, \"Thieves and murderers, hands yet red with blood and tongues yet black with lies | Clap and clamour--'Parnell spurs his Gladstone well!'\" In many of their personal lives, they also pursued decadent ideals. Wilde had a secret homosexual life. Swinburne had an obsession with flagellation.\n\nRussia\nThe Decadent Movement reached into Russia primarily through exposure to the writings of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Verlaine. The earliest Russian adherents lacked idealism and focused on such decadent themes as subversion of morality, disregard for personal health, and living in blasphemy and sensual pleasure. Russian writers were especially drawn to the morbid aspects of decadence and in the fascination with death. Dmitry Merezhkovsky is thought to be the first to clearly promote a Russian decadence that included the idealism that would eventually inspire the French symbolists to disassociate from the more purely materialistic Decadent Movement. The first Russian writers to achieve success as followers of this Decadent Movement included Konstanin Balmont, Fyodor Sologub, Valery Bryusov, and Zinaida Gippius. As they refined their craft beyond imitation of Baudelaire and Verlaine, most of these authors became much more clearly aligned with symbolism than with decadence. Some visual artists adhered to the Baju-esque late Decadent Movement approach to sexuality as purely an act of pleasure, often ensconced in a context of material luxury. They also shared the same emphasis on shocking society, purely for the scandal. Among them were Konstantin Somov, , and Nikolay Feofilaktov.\n\nSpain\n\nSome art historians consider Francisco de Goya one of the roots of the Decadent movement in Spain, almost 100 years before its start in France. Their works were a cry of denouncement against injustice and oppression. However, Ramón Casas and José María López Mezquita can be considered the model artists of this period. Their paintings are an image of the social conflicts and police repression that was happening in Spain at the time.\nSpaniard writers also wanted to be part of this movement. Emilia Pardo Bazán with works like Los Pazos de Ulloa where terror and decadent topics appear. El monstruo (The Monster), written by Antonio de Hoyos y Vinent belongs to Decadent Movement. But the Decadent Movement is overlapped by the Fin de Siglo Movement with the authors of the Generación del 98 being part-decadent: Ramón María del Valle-Inclán, Unamuno and Pío Baroja are the most essential figures of this period. \n\nUnited States\n\nFew prominent writers or artists in the United States were connected with the Decadent Movement. Those who were connected struggled to find an audience, for Americans were reluctant to see value for them in what they considered the art forms of fin de siècle France. Poet Francis Saltus Saltus was inspired by Charles Baudelaire, and his unpracticed style was occasionally compared to the French poet's more refined experimentation. He embraced the most debauched lifestyle of the French decadents and celebrated that life in his own poetry. At the time, mostly before Baju's \"Le Décadent\", this frivolous poetry on themes of alcohol and depravity found little success and no known support from those who were part of the Decadent Movement. The younger brother of Francis, writer Edgar Saltus had more success. He had some interaction with Oscar Wilde, and he valued decadence in his personal life. For a time, his work exemplified both the ideals and style of the movement, but a significant portion of his career was in traditional journalism and fiction that praised virtue. At the time when he was flourishing, however, multiple contemporary critics, as well as other decadent writers, explicitly considered him one of them. Writer James Huneker was exposed to the Decadent Movement in France and tried to bring it back with him to New York. He has been lauded to his dedication to this cause throughout his career, but it has also been suggested that, while he lived as a decadent and heralded their work, his own work was more frustrated, hopeless, and empty of the pleasure that had attracted him to the movement in the first place. Largely, he focused on cynically describing the impossibility of a true American decadence.\n\nGerman doctor and social critic Max Nordau wrote a lengthy book entitled \"Degeneration\" (1892). It was an examination of decadence as a trend, and specifically attacked several people associated with the Decadent Movement, as well as other figures throughout the world who deviated from cultural, moral, or political norms. His language was colorful and vitriolic, often invoking the worship of Satan. What made the book a success was its suggestion of a medical diagnosis of \"degeneration,\" a neuro-pathology that resulted in these behaviors. It also helped that the book named such figures as Oscar Wilde, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Paul Verlaine, and Maurice Barrès, members of the Decadent Movement who were in the public eye.\n\nIn 1930 Italian art and literature critic Mario Praz completed a broad study of morbid and erotic literature, translated and published in English as \"The Romantic Agony\" (1933). The study included decadent writing (such as Baudelaire and Swinburne), but also anything else that he considered dark, grim, or sexual in some way. His study centered on the 18th and 19th Centuries. The danger of such literature, he believed it unnaturally elevated the instinctive bond between pain and pleasure and that, no matter the artists' intention, the essential role of art is to educate and teach culture.\n\nFrench\n\nAustrian\n\nRussian\n\nBritish\n\nIrish\n\nItalian\n\nAmerican\n\nBelgian\nSpanish\nOthers\n\nFrench\n\nAustrian\n\nBelgian\nSpanish\n\nOther\n\n"}

Deference implies a yielding or submitting to the judgment of a recognized superior, out of respect or reverence. Deference has been studied extensively by political scientists, sociologists, and psychologists.\n\nSmolenski (2005) examines deference in colonial Pennsylvania, to see how claims to political authority were made, justified, and accepted or rejected. He focuses on the \"colonial speech economy,\" that is, the implicit rules that determined who was allowed to address whom and under what conditions, and describes how the qualities that inspired deference changed in the province from 1691 to 1764. The Quaker elite initially established a monopoly on political leadership based on what they believed to be their inherent civic virtue grounded in their religious and social class. By 1760, this view had been discredited and replaced with the consensus that civic virtue was an achieved, not an inherent, attribute and that it should be determined by the display of appropriate manliness and the valor of men who were willing to take up arms for the common defense of the colony. Further, Pennsylvanians came to believe that all white men, not just wealthy property owners, were equally capable of achieving political voice. Martial masculinity, therefore, became the defining characteristic of the ideal citizen and marked a significant transformation in the way individuals justified their right to represent the public interest.\n\nErving Goffman, a Canadian-born sociologist and writer, explored the relationship between deference and demeanor in his 1967 essay \"The Nature of Deference and Demeanor\". According to Goffman, a person with a poor demeanor will be held in lower esteem in the eyes of society. The same is true for people who behave in a good demeanor, however: society will hold them in a higher esteem. An example of this situation can be seen through the way a person acts in a social setting. e.g. a man pulling out a chair for a woman at a restaurant. On the other end of the spectrum, a person not bathing before they go to a fancy dinner party. These examples can be defined as presentational deference. Demeanor does not only limit itself to the actions of an individual, but also the appearance of an individual. A person offers themselves to a social group through a good appearance or a well demeanored appearance. When an individual has a well demeanored appearance it makes interaction between people easier. After a person is socially accepted to a group, it is expected that they will conform to interactional norms. Through acting on those norms, people receive deference.\n\nThere is ongoing debate among psychologists as to the extent to which deference in a relationship is determined by a person's innate personality type or is the result of a person's experiences and conditioning. In interpersonal relationships, a partner can assume a submissive role to fit in or to make him or herself acceptable to the other partner, and can be a benign aspect of a relationship. On the other hand, it may be an indication of an interpersonal problem, such as partner abuse. If one or both of the people are experiencing chronic, pervasive emotional distress then the sex partners or individuals may require psychological evaluation.\n\nIn interpersonal relationships, some people prefer or are willing to adopt a submissive role in sexual activities or personal matters. The level and type of submission can vary from person to person, and from one context to another; and also is dependent on the other partner being willing to assume control in those situations. Some people can include occasional acts of submission in an otherwise conventional sex life, or adopt a submissive lifestyle.\n\n"}

It lies on a ridge on the northern bank of the Tywi, with a steep drop of one hundred feet to the river. Dinefwr was the chief seat of the Kingdom of Deheubarth. The castle is a Grade I listed building. \n\nThe present castle is entered via a massive door protected by a restored length of battlement. The short path from the car park reveals impressive views of the Towy valley. The door admits the visitor to the main space enclosed by the walls, from which there are several stairs to the main battlements and towers. A narrow spiral staircase leads to a high tower, which gives extensive views of the deer park to the north and the Tywi valley to the south and west. The castle keep is entered via the cellar at its base, but access to the circular walkway at the top can only be made via the battlement walk. Details such as the well and several garderobes are visible in the structure. There is a path around the base of the main structure to the north.\n\nTradition relates that a castle was first constructed on this site by Rhodri the Great, but there are no remains from this period. Dinefwr later became the chief seat of Rhodri's grandson Hywel Dda, first ruler of Deheubarth and later king of most of Wales. Rhys ap Gruffydd, ruler of Deheubarth from 1155 to 1197, is thought to have rebuilt the castle. Giraldus Cambrensis tells a story about a plan by King Henry II of England to assault the castle during a campaign against Rhys. One of Henry's most trusted followers was sent on reconnaissance, guided by a local Welsh cleric, who was asked to lead him to the castle by the easiest route, but instead took the most difficult route he could find, ending the performance by stopping to eat grass with the explanation that this was the diet of the local people in times of hardship. The planned attack was duly abandoned.\n\nRhys ap Gruffydd also built the spectacular castle at Carreg Cennen, about four miles away to the south. It is not visible from Dynefwr, but Dryslwyn Castle can just be seen on a hill blocking the Tywi valley to the south-west. Rhys also founded two religious houses during this period. Talley Abbey was the first Premonstratensian abbey in Wales, while Llanllyr was a Cistercian nunnery, only the second nunnery to be founded in Wales and the first to prosper.\n\nOn Rhys ap Gruffydd's death the castle passed to his son Rhys Gryg, and the earliest parts of the present castle are thought to derive from this period. Llywelyn the Great of Gwynedd was now extending his influence to this area, and Rhys, finding himself unable to resist, dismantled the castle. Llywelyn however had it restored and held it until his death in 1240. In 1255 Llywelyn the Last gave Dinefwr to Rhys Fychan, then later gave it to Maredudd ap Rhys before later returning it to Rhys Fychan. Maredydd now allied himself to King Edward I of England, and helped Edward capture Dinefwr in 1277. Maredudd had apparently been promised Dinefwr in return for his help, but Edward did not keep his promise and had Maredudd executed in 1291.\n\nThe castle now came into English hands, though it is recorded to have been burnt during the rebellion of Llywelyn Bren in 1316. In 1317 it was given to Hugh Despenser, the king's favourite. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the forces of Owain Glyndŵr in 1403. Towards the end of the 15th century the castle was held by Sir Rhys ap Thomas, who carried out extensive rebuilding. In 1531 his grandson Rhys ap Gruffydd was executed for treason and the castle was confiscated by the crown, though the family were later able to recover it. In 1660 Newton House was built nearby and the castle keep modified as a summer house. The remains of the large windows can be seen at the top of the keep, but it burned down in the 18th century.\nThe castle is now owned by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and managed by CADW on their behalf.\n\nThe castle is now owned by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (who do not charge for entry) and is managed by Cadw but lies within Dinefwr Park, which is owned by the National Trust. Visitors who wish to see the castle and are driving there, may park in the town and walk up to the Castle using the free Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales access route. If visitors walk or park in the National Trust site and are not National Trust, Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales or Cadw members there is a site entrance charge. There is a small free car park near the castle for disabled badge holders, but it can only be reached by a rough track through a field. Permission can be gained at the National Trust office to drive over the field up to the castle, weather and conditions permitting.\n\n\n"}

He studied at a variety of institutions of higher education in the U.S.: Adelphi College, Hobart College, University of Utah, and the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\nAt Seattle, he was able to study with Dezhung Rinpoche and members of the Sakya Phuntso Phodrang family who had been brought to Seattle under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation grant to the Far Eastern and Russian Institute. He studied Tibetan culture and Buddhism with Dezhung Rinpoche from 1960 to 1964 and spent the summer of 1962 traveling to the other Rockefeller centers in Europe to meet with other Tibetan savants.\n\nIn 1964 he completed his Ph.D. qualifying exams and traveled to Leiden for advanced studies in Sanskrit and Pali. In 1965 he went to India under a Foreign Area Fellowship Program (Ford Foundation) grant to study with living exponents of all of the Tibetan Buddhist and Bönpo traditions.\n\nHe began his studies with Geshe Lobsang Lungtok (Ganden Changtse), Drukpa Thoosay Rinpoche and Khenpo Noryang, and Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche. He decided to remain in India to continue serious studies of Tibetan Buddhism and culture. He traveled extensively in the borderlands of India and Nepal. In 1968 he joined the Library of Congress New Delhi Field Office. He then began a project which was to last over the next two and a half decades, the reprinting of the Tibetan books which had been brought by the exile community or were with members of the Tibetan-speaking communities in Sikkim, Bhutan, India, and Nepal.\n\nHe became field director of the Library of Congress Field Office in India in 1980 and served there until 1985 when he was transferred to Indonesia. He stayed in Jakarta running the Southeast Asian programs until 1994 when he was assigned to the Library of Congress Middle Eastern Office in Cairo.\n\nIn 1997 he retired from the Library of Congress. He briefly worked as a consultant for Trace Foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan and Inner Asian Resources in New York, an organisation dedicated to the preservation and dissemination of Tibetan literature.\n\nIn 1999, Smith founded the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC), together with Leonard van der Kuijp of Harvard University and friends to digitize the 12,000 volume corpus of Tibetan literature. This digital library is the largest collection of Tibetan literature outside of Tibet. TBRC continues to acquire, preserve, organize and make available Tibetan texts.\n\nIn 2001, Wisdom Publications published \"Among Tibetan Texts\", a collection of essays that Smith wrote back in his Delhi times, as introductions to Library of Congress reprints of Tibetan texts. As introductions to Tibetan literature, culture and history, these had circulated since the early 1980s amongst students and researchers, and had acquired a sort of cult status. A chapter is also devoted to Smith in David Jackson's biography of Dezhung Rinpoche, \"A Saint in Seattle.\"\n\nHe is the subject of the award-winning documentary \"Digital Dharma\". \"Variety\" called the film \"an affectionate tribute to the late E. Gene Smith, the scholar, librarian and ex-Mormon who waged a 50-year struggle to save the endangered texts of Tibetan Buddhism.\" It received a theatrical release and was invited to qualify for Academy Award consideration by the International Documentary Association through the 2012 \"DocuWeeks\" program.\n\n\n"}

She was the first Muslim woman to compete in the Olympic Games.\n\nÇambel was born in Berlin, German Empire on 27 August 1916, to Turkish military attaché Hasan Cemil Bey (Çambel), a close associate of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the Turkish Republic, and Remziye Hanım, the daughter of Ibrahim Hakki Pasha, a former Grand Vizier (prime minister of the Ottoman sultan) and the Ottoman ambassador to the German Empire at the time.\n\nShe completed her secondary education at Arnavutköy American High School for Girls (today Robert College). During the high school years, she was inspired by her history of art teacher, who organized visits to historic sites of Istanbul. It was at this time that she began to perform fencing. Between 1933-1939, she was educated in archaeology at Sorbonne University in Paris, France. Çambel became a scientific assistant at Istanbul University in 1940. In 1944, she received a doctorate. From 1947 on, Çambel served as lecturer. She was a visiting scholar for two years at University of Saarbrücken in Germany. In 1960, she was appointed professor, and founded the Institute of Prehistory. She became emeritus in 1984. \n\nOn returning to Istanbul after the 1936 Summer Olympics, where she represented her country, she started a relation with Nail Çakırhan, a communist poet and journalist, who became a celebrated architect.

Although invited by a \"female German official\" to meet Adolf Hitler, Çambel refused it on political grounds.\n\nAfter World War II, Çambel began studying with German archaeologist Helmuth Theodor Bossert (1889–1961), who was professor for archaeology at Istanbul University. In 1947, Bossert and she began excavating Karatepe, the walled city of 12th century BC late Hiitite king Azatiwada, located at the Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey. She played a key role in the decryption of Hittite hieroglyphics with the help of the Phoenician alphabet after their discovery of Karatepe Bilingual there.\n\nÇambel was also active in promoting the preservation of Turkey's cultural heritage. In the 1950s, she resisted the government's attempt to move the artifacts from Karatepe to a museum.

Hill, then-head of the railroad. Between 1904 and 1912, many of the town's houses were built, to house railroad workers working in the local yard. Hillyard was the home of the Great Northern's famed shops where locomotives were manufactured, repaired, and refurbished. At the time, the Hillyard shop was the largest in the nation.\n\nIn 1924, Hillyard was officially annexed by neighboring Spokane.\n\nDue to its historical roots as a town housing railroad workers, Hillyard acquired a rather rough reputation, which lasts into recent decades. (As recently as 1979, Daniel Leen described the Hillyard train yards in his book \"The Freighthoppers Manual for North America\" as having \"the feel of warmed-over death.\") After the Great Northern underwent a series of mergers, becoming the Burlington Northern Railroad and eventually the BNSF Railway, the Hillyard yard and shops were closed in the early 1980s with BN's main yard operations in Spokane moving to Yardley. Only the decaying structures of the old shops remain today. Hillyard suffers some of the worst poverty in Spokane, per capita it is the poorest neighborhood in the state of Washington.\n\nHillyard continues as a neighborhood of Spokane in which residents take pride. A Hillyard Festival is held every year in August, and the preservation of historic buildings is a local concern. Murals and a small railroad museum celebrate the town's history. Many of the neighborhood's residents are descended from the railroad workers who started the town, but Hillyard is recently becoming a popular home for immigrants of Russian, Ukrainian, Micronesian, and Southeast Asian descent. The downtown Hillyard business district, located on Market Street, has become Spokane's first neighborhood to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places. According to Teresa Brum, Spokane's Historic Preservation Officer in charge of the project to have Hillyard listed on the National Register: \"This is the most architecturally intact neighborhood left in Spokane. Most of it looks as it did 90 years ago.\" Hillyard neighborhood is still there and is still home to the lower class of Spokane.\n\nThe North Spokane Corridor has forced a large number of relocations in the neighborhood. However, it is predicted that the freeway's presence will help revitalize areas of the neighborhood that remain.\n"}

Mining development of the government of Popayán helped the processions receive great contribution in jewelry and apparel gold, silver and emeralds and other gemstones that adorned the pictures, the seats are embroidered with gold and the litter were painted with gold leaf. Most of the development of the processions was in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries period of the Spanish colony.

To this date the procession went out at seven o'clock in the evening. However, as a security measure Obando and Sarria take their bars on the corner of the street Mascarón (street and traditionally in Popayán).\n\nThe regional government, under the command of Manuel José Castrillón, learns the presence of Obando and Sarria in the procession and orders the end of the parade, the insurgent leaders are arrested. The town of Popayán was favored Obando then prepares for help and avoid being taken prisoner and for this his friends and colleagues agree signal \"dove\".

At this time it was thought that the processions definitely would end, as was the case since this event the procession of Easter Monday ends, but by the intervention of small groups of religious people the processions managed to resurface.\n\nIn the 19th century during independence from Colombia development decreases in processions due to war because most of the money was used for the liberation cause.\n\nFor the 20th century the same thing happened for the economic crisis that Colombia lived. In 1937 the Master Guillermo Valencia, decided to form a Civic Council to take care to preserve that tradition and 1939 said board received official recognition by the ordinance No. 14 issued by the Assembly of Cauca. The new body was given the name of \" 'Board Permanent Pro Easter Popayán' \"\n\nIn one of the nights of Easter, referring to sahumadoras from one of the balconies of the city the Chilean poet Julio Barrenechea told Jorge Enrique Velasco:\nSome rains forced to suspend the processions. On Holy Thursday, March 31, 1938, when it was not possible to draw the procession the next day marched three extra steps after having had to intervene Guillermo Valencia to achieve because freighters desire to not endured load that year.\n\nIn the Easter of 1964 it rained for three days from Tuesday to Thursday and no procession managed to completely finish its route, cargo ships managed by the Board and the Archdiocese of Popayán in compensation authorize take 22 steps the Friday instead of 12 who were scheduled, so it was necessary to use 176 freighters.\n\nSome steps have fallen by breaking any of the bars as in the case of \"judgment\" of Maundy Thursday in 1940 in the street trade and \"logos\" against the Popayán Teatro Friday of 1949, to break the bar of the front right corner.\n\nOn 22 March 1951 Mr. Don Arcesius Velasco Iragorri \"The Cripple\" died in front of the Church of San José the Holy Wednesday loading the passage of \"The Taking \"on the right front. This is one of the heaviest steps for its size and proportions of images. Since 1952 the passage of \"The Arrest\" to reach the Church of San Jose, pays homage to its freighter deceased is called \"The Touch\" where family members give continuity to the legacy of \"Lad\", and friends say the step on his shoulders for a minute, commemorating the fact fateful March 22.\n\nIn recent years the processions have been enriched with new steps, such as Jesus' encounter with the women on the street of bitterness, Mr. expiration, The Descent, The transfer of Christ to the tomb, our lady virgin Easter, our lord Jesus Christ resurrected, among other images made by Spanish and Ecuadorian imaginary.\n\nFrom 21 February to 3 April 2003 the National Museum of Colombia presented in its temporary exhibition hall and alternates hall, an exhibition called \"Holy Week in Popayán.

He is the founder of a unique method that revolutionised the Romanian school of acting.\n\nIon Cojar changed the old way of understanding acting in Romania, when the actor was taught how to play theatre, to act, to fake, imitate or mimic life, emotions or characters, with a new one that demands actors, directors and teachers to create the circumstances in which the truth of life can occur, and the actor/actress to go onstage or during filming through authentic psychologically-realistic processes that cannot be anticipated or consciously controlled, at the end of which he/she would be actually changed as a person, so that the audiences may be able to follow the lifelike processes, to understand and believe what they see and hear, to empathize with the actors.\n\nIon Cojar argued that in order to have an authentic performance, the actor’s psycho-emotional processes, along with his speech, body movements and physiological changes, which are the results of those processes, must not be anticipated, because this way they would be anchored in preconceived ideas and would not be new and authentic, and also must not be consciously controlled, because we cannot observe our own processes as they are taking place without interrupting them.\n\nIn everyday life we never know what is going to happen or how we are going to behave or what we are going to say when we interact with someone. We just try to change something in that person in order to achieve our goal. In the same way, the actor, in a certain life situation and with a certain psychology that were previously assumed, aims to actually change something in his partner in order to achieve his goal (his character’s goal that he previously assumed), without anticipating any obstacles, by venturing into the unknown and allowing himself the freedom to make mistakes. This way, everything that will happen to him in the process, from emotions to body movements to speech, will come organically, without being consciously controlled or anticipated, and this way they will be authentic, just like in everyday life, and thus the audiences will understand and believe what they’ll see and hear and will empathize with the actor.\n\nIon Cojar also argued that we can know for sure that the actor is not faking or acting, but is going through an authentic process when we see instant, organic changes in the color and texture of his face, like when blood instantly floods its vessels in important moments, because these changes are impossible to fake.\n\nAs a professor and researcher at \"The National University of Theatre and Film from Bucharest\", guided by the principle \"process, not success\", Ion Cojar worked with his students in order for them to develop a specific psycho-emotional mechanism that, along with the use of a specific acting method, would allow them to easily transform conventions in life truth (conventions like fictional and imaginary life situations, given plot and lines, a character’s personality and goal etc.), unlike the old acting school when students were taught how to play theatre. Ion Cojar always said that \"the art of the actor has nothing in common with theatre\", a statement that became his trademark.\n\nThe professional actors who were trained via Cojar's pedagogical method tend to use in their creative processes an acting method derived from the previous one. One of his former students, Luminita Gheorghiu, won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actress with her performance in The Death of Mr. Lazarescu (2005). Professor Mircea Gheorghiu, another former student of Ion Cojar, is considered to be the main continuator of his teaching method in the art of the actor. Adrian Țofei, a former student of Mircea Gheorgiu, won the Special Jury Prize for Best Actor at the 2016 Nashville Film Festival for his performance in .<ref name=\"https://nashvillefilmfestival.org/news/2016-feature-award-winners/\"></ref>\n\nIn parallel with the development of his method, Ion Cojar supported an educational system in which the students are not taught or modeled by the teachers, but in which the environment is that of laboratory experimentation and self-knowledge, of despecialization and deliverance from preconceptions acquired in family, school and society, an environment in which the student is able to become aware of and to use his/her full native creative potential that makes him/her unique.\n\nIn theory, Ion Cojar gathered all his research and discoveries in his book entitled \"\"O poetică a artei actorului\" (\"Poetics of the actor's art\"\").\n\nAs a theatre director, Ion Cojar also argued that the audiences, in order to empathize in a total way with what they’re seeing and hearing, must not have any clue or the impression that they're witnessing a theatre show, but a genuine life event. He aimed to make theatre shows that paradoxically don’t look like shows at all, where the audiences would find no elements whatsoever to indicate that they are witnessing a theatre show and not an actual life event.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57721061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57721061", "title": "Jacob Brafman", "text": "Jacob Brafman\n\nIakov Aleksandrovich Brafman (1825—28 December 1879), commonly known as Jacob Brafman, was a Russian Jew from near Minsk, who became notable for converting first to Lutheranism and then the Russian Orthodox Church. He was a leading polemicist against the kahal (the communal Jewish theocratic government in Russia) and the Talmud. Brafman's works \"The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods\" (1868) and \"The Book of the Kahal\" (1869) were foundational texts in establishing a theoretical basis to modern anti-Jewish thought in Russia and established a framework for themes later covered in \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\".\nBrafman was born in 1825 and lived in Kletsk, a \"shtetl\" near Minsk in the Pale of Settlement. His father was a rabbi. The Jews had lived in the town since the 16th century, when it was part of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but had in Brafman's fathers lifetime become part of the Russian Empire following the Second Partition of Poland. Brafman grew up in poor conditions and was orphaned at a young age, being raised by relatives. Despite being under age, local agents of the \"kahal\" (the communal Jewish government ran by rabbis in the Pale, which dealt with taxation and conscription), placed Brafman on a list of \"volunteers\" for the Imperial Russian Army. Not being particularly fond of this idea, Brafman fled the reach of the kahal and went to Minsk, where he tried to establish himself as a photographer.\n\nOnce in Minsk, Brafman converted to Lutheranism for a time, before in 1858 converting to the Russian Orthodox Church. There was a state visit to Minsk in that year by Tsar Alexander II of Russia and Brafman submitted a memorandum on how Jews in Russia should best be proselytized into Orthodox Christianity and educated into \"useful\" subjects. The dichtomy of useful and usless Jews had been established by Tsar Nicholas I of Russia. Nicholas saw \"use\" in bourgeois Jews who were willing to assimilate into Russian society and could be utilised in academic and agricultural professions, while seeing as \"useless\" the poorer adherents of Orthodox Judaism who lived in the \"shtets\" and kept themselves apart from wider society. Brafman's writing was sent to St. Petersburg and subsequently earned him the chair of Hebrew Studies at the Russian Orthodox Seminary in Minsk in 1860.\n\nBrafman moved to Vilna in 1866 and began writing vehemently against the \"kahal\" and Jewish organisations more generally. Brafman; who had his own personal conflict with the \"kahal\" as a young man; argued that the kahal existed as a tyranny against individual Jews, while also being a system which enabled the exploitation of their non-Jewish neighbours. He argued that the mentality of the \"kahal\" was the main barrier to Jewish assimilation. Brafman worked on studying Jewish community books of the \"kahal\" from Minsk from the years 1794 and 1833, with his own commentary added to try and prove his thesis; at the same time the Rabbinical Seminary of Vilna was providing their own Russian translation. Brafman published his findings as \"The Book of the Kahal: Materials for the Study of the Jewish Life\" (1869). Brafman joined the Imperial Russian Geographical Society in 1870 and became a respected figure in academia.\n\nOne of the main problems with Brafman's thesis was that the \"kahal\" system itself in the Russian Empire had been dissolved under Nicholas I in 1844. For Brafman he posited a conspiracy theory that the \"kahal\" in fact continued to exist as a secret shadow government among Jews, with reactionary rabbis working to keep control over the \"average Jew\" and to undermine Christian business interests at the same time. Brafman's works chimed well with the Slavophiles then active in Russia and the political theory of \"Orthodoxy, Autocracy and Nationality\", which sought to distance Russian civilisation from French and British liberalism. Brafman's other major work, \"The Local and Universal Jewish Brotherhoods\" (1868), took aim at international Jewish organisations, particularly those based in France. His main object for criticism was the \"Alliance Israélite Universelle\" under prominent freemason, Adolphe Crémieux. For Brafman this was the \"kahal of kahals\" and as part of an international Jewish conspiracy controlled the other \"kahals\". He saw this as the successor of the Grand Sanhedrin (Napoleon Bonaparte's Rabbinic Assembly of 1807).\n\nBrafman also took aim at the Talmud, claiming that the Jews, using Talmudic principles, would exclude adherents of other religions from trade and industry and themselves accumulate all capital and landed property. Brafman's works, which included the idea of a secret Jewish shadow government and the aspects of an internationally orchestrated \"conspiracy\" against all Christian nations, crossing over with masonic involvement, provided an essential framework for what would become, \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\", authored by agents of the Okhrana at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nBrafman was particularly well received by conservative Slavophiles in Russia. Vsevolod Krestovskii, one of the most widely read Russian writers of the day, was inspired by Brafman to write a trilogy of novels; \"The Darkness of Egypt\", \"Tamara Bendavid\" and \"The Triumph of Baal\". For Krestovskii, the \"kahal of kahals\" in Paris, with a network of Jewish spies was used to back up British-French militarism against Russia, causing defeat in the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) of the Great Eastern Crisis (British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli in particular is singled out as an \"arch-villain\").\n\nHal Draper, an American Trotskyist, in his book \"Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution\" claimed that Mikhail Bakunin; one of the Russian founding figures of anarchism; was likely inspired by Brafman's writings on Jews. In the case of Bakunin, in a letter written in December 1871, he made the claim that Jews were a \"collective parasite\", and claimed that \"this world is presently, at the disposal of Marx on the one hand and the Rothschilds on the other,\" putting a conspiratorial spin on this theme as part of his rivalry with the Marxian socialists in the First International.\n\nOne of Brafman's great-grandchildren was Vladislav Khodasevich, the Russian literary critic\n\n\n"}

The number of collaborations that its founding made possible, and their impact, ultimately led to the Center being referred to in the scholarly literature as \"Piaget's factory\".\n\nAccording to Ernst von Glasersfeld, Jean Piaget was \"the great pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowing.\" However, his ideas did not become widely popularized until the 1960s. This then led to the emergence of the study of development as a major sub-discipline in psychology. By the end of the 20th century, Piaget was second only to B. F. Skinner as the most cited psychologist of that era.\n\nPiaget was born in 1896 in Neuchâtel, in the Francophone region of Switzerland. He was the oldest son of Arthur Piaget (Swiss), a professor of medieval literature at the University of Neuchâtel, and Rebecca Jackson (French). Piaget was a precocious child who developed an interest in biology and the natural world. His early interest in zoology earned him a reputation among those in the field after he had published several articles on mollusks by the age of 15. When he was 15, his former nanny wrote to his parents to apologize for having once lied to them about fighting off a would-be kidnapper from baby Jean's pram. There never was a kidnapper. Piaget became fascinated that he had somehow formed a memory of this kidnapping incident, a memory that endured even after he understood it to be false.\n\nHe developed an interest in epistemology due to his godfather's urgings to study the fields of philosophy and logic. He was educated at the University of Neuchâtel, and studied briefly at the University of Zürich. During this time, he published two philosophical papers that showed the direction of his thinking at the time, but which he later dismissed as adolescent thought. His interest in psychoanalysis, at the time a burgeoning strain of psychology, can also be dated to this period. Piaget moved from Switzerland to Paris, France after his graduation and he taught at the Grange-Aux-Belles Street School for Boys. The school was run by Alfred Binet, the developer of the Binet-Simon test (later revised by Lewis Terman to become the Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales). Piaget assisted in the marking of Binet's intelligence tests. It was while he was helping to mark some of these tests that Piaget noticed that young children consistently gave wrong answers to certain questions. Piaget did not focus so much on the fact of the children's answers being wrong, but that young children consistently made types of mistakes that older children and adults did not. This led him to the theory that young children's cognitive processes are inherently different from those of adults. Ultimately, he was to propose a global theory of cognitive developmental stages in which individuals exhibit certain common patterns of cognition in each period of development. In 1921, Piaget returned to Switzerland as director of the Rousseau Institute in Geneva. At this time, the institute was directed by Édouard Claparède. Piaget was familiar with many of Claparède's ideas including that of the psychological concept 'groping' which was closely associated with \"trials and errors\" observed in human mental patterns.\n\nIn 1923, he married Valentine Châtenay (7 January 1899 – 3 July 1983) the couple had three children, whom Piaget studied from infancy. From 1925 to 1929, Piaget worked as a professor of psychology, sociology, and the philosophy of science at\nthe University of Neuchatel. In 1929, Jean Piaget accepted the post of Director of the International Bureau of Education and remained the head of this international organization until 1968. Every year, he drafted his \"Director's Speeches\" for the IBE Council and for the International Conference on Public Education in which he explicitly addressed his educational credo.\n\nHaving taught at the University of Geneva and at the University of Paris, in 1964, Piaget was invited to serve as chief consultant at two conferences at Cornell University (March 11–13) and University of California, Berkeley (March 16–18). The conferences addressed the relationship of cognitive studies and curriculum development and strived to conceive implications of recent investigations of children's cognitive development for curricula.\n\nIn 1979 he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Social and Political Sciences. He died in 1980 and was buried with his family in an unmarked grave in the Cimetière des Rois (Cemetery of Kings) in Geneva. This was as per his request.\n\nHarry Beilin described Jean Piaget's theoretical research program as consisting of four phases:\nThe resulting theoretical frameworks are sufficiently different from each other that they have been characterized as representing different \"Piagets.\" More recently, Jeremy Burman responded to Beilin and called for the addition of a phase before his turn to psychology: \"the zeroeth Piaget.\"\n\nBefore Piaget became a psychologist, he trained in natural history and philosophy. He received a doctorate in 1918 from the University of Neuchatel. He then undertook post-doctoral training in Zurich (1918–1919), and Paris (1919–1921). He was hired by Théodore Simon to standardize psychometric measures for use with French children in 1919. The theorist we recognize today only emerged when he moved to Geneva, to work for Édouard Claparède as director of research at the Rousseau Institute, in 1922.\n\nPiaget first developed as a psychologist in the 1920s. He investigated the hidden side of children’s minds. Piaget proposed that children moved from a position of egocentrism to sociocentrism. For this explanation he combined the use of psychological and clinical methods to create what he called a semiclinical interview. He began the interview by asking children standardized questions and depending on how they answered, he would ask them a series of nonstandard questions. Piaget was looking for what he called \"spontaneous conviction\" so he often asked questions the children neither expected nor anticipated. In his studies, he noticed there was a gradual progression from intuitive to scientific and socially acceptable responses. Piaget theorized children did this because of the social interaction and the challenge to younger children’s ideas by the ideas of those children who were more advanced.\n\nThis work was used by Elton Mayo as the basis for the famous Hawthorne Experiments. For Piaget, it also led to an honorary doctorate from Harvard in 1936.\n\nIn this stage, Piaget believed that the process of thinking and the intellectual development could be regarded as an extension of the biological process of the adaptation of the species, which has also two on-going processes: assimilation and accommodation. There is \"assimilation\" when a child responds to a new event in a way that is consistent with an existing schema. There is \"accommodation\" when a child either modifies an existing schema or forms an entirely new schema to deal with a new object or event.\n\nHe argued infants were engaging in an act of assimilation when they sucked on everything in their reach. He claimed infants transform all objects into an object to be sucked. The children were assimilating the objects to conform to their own mental structures. Piaget then made the assumption that whenever one transforms the world to meet individual needs or conceptions, one is, in a way, assimilating it. Piaget also observed his children not only assimilating objects to fit their needs, but also modifying some of their mental structures to meet the demands of the environment. This is the second division of adaptation known as accommodation. To start out, the infants only engaged in primarily reflex actions such as sucking, but not long after, they would pick up objects and put them in their mouths. When they do this, they modify their reflex response to accommodate the external objects into reflex actions. Because the two are often in conflict, they provide the impetus for intellectual development. The constant need to balance the two triggers intellectual growth.\n\nTo test his theory, Piaget observed the habits in his own children.\n\nIn the model Piaget developed in stage three, he argued that intelligence develops in a series of stages that are related to age and are progressive because one stage must be accomplished before the next can occur. For each stage of development the child forms a view of reality for that age period. At the next stage, the child must keep up with earlier level of mental abilities to reconstruct concepts. Piaget conceived intellectual development as an upward expanding spiral in which children must constantly reconstruct the ideas formed at earlier levels with new, higher order concepts acquired at the next level.\n\nIt is primarily the \"Third Piaget\" (the logical model of intellectual development) that was debated by American psychologists when Piaget's ideas were \"rediscovered\" in the 1960s.\n\nPiaget studied areas of intelligence like perception and memory that are not entirely logical. Logical concepts are described as being completely reversible because they can always get back to the starting point, meaning that if one starts with a given premise and follows logical steps to reach a conclusion, the same steps may be done in the opposite order, starting from the conclusion to arrive at the premise. The perceptual concepts Piaget studied could not be manipulated. To describe the figurative process, Piaget uses pictures as examples. Pictures cannot be separated because contours cannot be separated from the forms they outline. Memory is the same way: it is never completely reversible; people cannot necessarily recall all the intervening events between two points. During this last period of work, Piaget and his colleague Inhelder also published books on perception, memory, and other figurative processes such as learning.\n\nBecause Piaget's theory is based upon biological maturation and stages, the notion of readiness is important. Readiness concerns when certain information or concepts should be taught. According to Piaget's theory, children should not be taught certain concepts until they reached the appropriate stage of cognitive development. For example, young children in the preoperational stage engage in \"irreversible\" thought and cannot comprehend that an item that has been transformed in some way may be returned to its original state.\n\nPiaget defined himself as a 'genetic' epistemologist, interested in the process of the qualitative development of knowledge. He considered cognitive structures development as a differentiation of biological regulations. When his entire theory first became known – the theory in itself being based on a structuralist and a cognitivitist approach – it was an outstanding and exciting development in regards to the psychological community at that time.\n\nThere are a total of four phases in Piaget's research program that included books on certain topics of developmental psychology. In particular, during one period of research, he described himself studying his own three children, and carefully observing and interpreting their cognitive development. In one of his last books, \"Equilibration of Cognitive Structures: The Central Problem of Intellectual Development\", he intends to explain knowledge development as a process of equilibration using two main concepts in his theory, assimilation and accommodation, as belonging not only to biological interactions but also to cognitive ones.\n\nPiaget believed answers for the epistemological questions at his time could be answered, or better proposed, if one looked to the genetic aspect of it, hence his experimentations with children and adolescents. As he says in the introduction of his book \"Genetic Epistemology\": \"What the genetic epistemology proposes is discovering the roots of the different varieties of knowledge, since its elementary forms, following to the next levels, including also the scientific knowledge.\"\n\nThe four development stages are described in Piaget's theory as:\n\n1. \"Sensorimotor stage\": from birth to age two. The children experience the world through movement and their senses. During the sensorimotor stage children are extremely egocentric, meaning they cannot perceive the world from others' viewpoints. The sensorimotor stage is divided into six substages:\n\nSome followers of Piaget's studies of infancy, such as Kenneth Kaye argue that his contribution was as an observer of countless phenomena not previously described, but that he didn't offer explanation of the processes in real time that cause those developments, beyond analogizing them to broad concepts about biological adaptation generally. Kaye's \"apprenticeship theory\" of cognitive and social development refuted Piaget's assumption that mind developed endogenously in infants until the capacity for symbolic reasoning allowed them to learn language.\n\n2. \"Preoperational stage\": Piaget's second stage, the pre-operational stage, starts when the child begins to learn to speak at age two and lasts up until the age of seven. During the pre-operational Stage of cognitive development, Piaget noted that children do not yet understand concrete logic and cannot mentally manipulate information. Children’s increase in playing and pretending takes place in this stage. However, the child still has trouble seeing things from different points of view. The children's play is mainly categorized by symbolic play and manipulating symbols. Such play is demonstrated by the idea of checkers being snacks, pieces of paper being plates, and a box being a table. Their observations of symbols exemplifies the idea of play with the absence of the actual objects involved. By observing sequences of play, Piaget was able to demonstrate that, towards the end of the second year, a qualitatively new kind of psychological functioning occurs, known as the Pre-operational Stage.\n\nThe pre-operational stage is sparse and logically inadequate in regard to mental operations. The child is able to form stable concepts as well as magical beliefs. The child, however, is still not able to perform operations, which are tasks that the child can do mentally, rather than physically. Thinking in this stage is still egocentric, meaning the child has difficulty seeing the viewpoint of others. The Pre-operational Stage is split into two substages: the symbolic function substage, and the intuitive thought substage. The symbolic function substage is when children are able to understand, represent, remember, and picture objects in their mind without having the object in front of them. The intuitive thought substage is when children tend to propose the questions of \"why?\" and \"how come?\" This stage is when children want the knowledge of knowing everything.\n\nThe Preoperational Stage is divided into two substages:\n\n3. \"Concrete operational stage\": from ages seven to eleven. Children can now conserve and think logically (they understand reversibility) but are limited to what they can physically manipulate. They are no longer egocentric. During this stage, children become more aware of logic and conservation, topics previously foreign to them. Children also improve drastically with their classification skills\n\n4. \"Formal operational stage\": from age eleven to sixteen and onwards (development of abstract reasoning). Children develop abstract thought and can easily conserve and think logically in their mind. Abstract thought is newly present during this stage of development. Children are now able to think abstractly and utilize metacognition. Along with this, the children in the formal operational stage display more skills oriented towards problem solving, often in multiple steps.\n\nPiaget provided no concise description of the development process as a whole. Broadly speaking it consisted of a cycle:\n\n\nThis process may not be wholly gradual, but new evidence shows that the passage into new stages is more gradual than once thought. Once a new level of organization, knowledge and insight proves to be effective, it will quickly be generalized to other areas \"if they exist\". As a result, transitions between stages can seem to be rapid and radical, but oftentimes the child has grasped one aspect of the new stage of cognitive functioning but not addressed others. The bulk of the time spent in a new stage consists of refining this new cognitive level; however it does not always happen quickly. For example, a child may see that two different colors of Play-Doh have been fused together to make one ball, based on the color. However, if sugar is mixed into water or iced tea, then the sugar \"disappeared\" and therefore does not exist to the child at that stage. These levels of one concept of cognitive development are not realized all at once, giving us a gradual realization of the world around us.\n\nIt is because this process takes this dialectical form, in which each new stage is created through the further differentiation, integration, and synthesis of new structures out of the old, that the sequence of cognitive stages are logically necessary rather than simply empirically correct. Each new stage emerges only because the child can take for granted the achievements of its predecessors, and yet there are still more sophisticated forms of knowledge and action that are capable of being developed.\n\nBecause it covers both how we gain knowledge about objects and our reflections on our own actions, Piaget's model of development explains a number of features of human knowledge that had never previously been accounted for. For example, by showing how children progressively enrich their understanding of things by acting on and reflecting on the effects of their own previous knowledge, they are able to organize their knowledge in increasingly complex structures. Thus, once a young child can consistently and accurately recognize different kinds of animals, he or she then acquires the ability to organize the different kinds into higher groupings such as \"birds\", \"fish\", and so on. This is significant because they are now able to know things about a new animal simply on the basis of the fact that it is a bird – for example, that it will lay eggs.\n\nAt the same time, by reflecting on their own actions, the child develops an increasingly sophisticated awareness of the \"rules\" that govern in various ways. For example, it is by this route that Piaget explains this child's growing awareness of notions such as \"right\", \"valid\", \"necessary\", \"proper\", and so on. In other words, it is through the process of objectification, reflection and abstraction that the child constructs the principles on which action is not only effective or correct but also \"justified\".\n\nOne of Piaget's most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old, and four and a half years old. He began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets, one with the sweets in a line spread further apart, and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together. He found that, \"Children between 2 years, 6 months old and 3 years, 2 months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows; between 3 years, 2 months and 4 years, 6 months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have \"more\"; after 4 years, 6 months they again discriminate correctly\" (\"Cognitive Capacity of Very Young Children\", p. 141). Initially younger children were not studied, because if at four years old a child could not conserve quantity, then a younger child presumably could not either. The results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation, but as they get older they lose this quality, and do not recover it until four and a half years old. This attribute may be lost due to a temporary inability to solve because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies, which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy, or due to the inability for a four-year-old to reverse situations.\n\nBy the end of this experiment several results were found. First, younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged. This study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations, depending on how logical the structure of the task is. Research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age 5 and as a result, the child will count the sweets to decide which has more. Finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans' native inheritance.\n\nAccording to Jean Piaget, genetic epistemology attempts to \"explain knowledge, and in particular scientific knowledge, on the basis of its history, its sociogenesis, and especially the psychological origins of the notions and operations upon which it is based\". Piaget believed he could test epistemological questions by studying the development of thought and action in children. As a result, Piaget created a field known as genetic epistemology with its own methods and problems. He defined this field as the study of child development as a means of answering epistemological questions.\n\nA Schema is a structured cluster of concepts, it can be used to represent objects, scenarios or sequences of events or relations. The original idea was proposed by philosopher Immanuel Kant as innate structures used to help us perceive the world.\n\nA schema (pl. schemata) is the mental framework that is created as children interact with their physical and social environments. For example, many 3-year-olds insist that the sun is alive because it comes up in the morning and goes down at night. According to Piaget, these children are operating based on a simple cognitive schema that things that move are alive. At any age, children rely on their current cognitive structures to understand the world around them. Moreover, younger and older children may often interpret and respond to the same objects and events in very different ways because cognitive structures take different forms at different ages.\n\nPiaget (1953) described three kinds of intellectual structures: behavioural (or sensorimotor) schemata, symbolic schemata, and operational schemata.\n\n\nAccording to Piaget, children use the process of assimilation and accommodation to create a schema or mental framework for how they perceive and/or interpret what they are experiencing. As a result, the early concepts of young children tend to be more global or general in nature.\n\nSimilarly, Gallagher and Reid (1981) maintained that adults view children’s concepts as highly generalized and even inaccurate. With added experience, interactions, and maturity, these concepts become refined and more detailed. Overall, making sense of the world from a child’s perspective is a very complex and time-consuming process.\n\nSchemata are:\n\nThese schemata are constantly being revised and elaborated upon each time the child encounters new experiences. In doing this children create their own unique understanding of the world, interpret their own experiences and knowledge, and subsequently use this knowledge to solve more complex problems. In a neurological sense, the brain/mind is constantly working to build and rebuild itself as it takes in, adapts/modifies new information, and enhances understanding.\n\nIn his \"Biology and Knowledge\" (1967+ / French 1965), Piaget tentatively hinted at possible physical embodiments for his abstract schema entities. At the time, there was much talk and research about RNA as such an agent of learning, and Piaget considered some of the evidence. However, he did not offer any firm conclusions, and confessed that this was beyond his area of expertise.\n\nPiaget wanted to revolutionize the way research was conducted. Although he started researching with his colleagues using a traditional method of data collection, he was not fully satisfied with the results and wanted to keep trying to find new ways of researching using a combination of data, which included naturalistic observation, psychometrics, and the psychiatric clinical examination, in order to have a less guided form of research that would produce more empirically valid results.\nAs Piaget developed new research methods, he wrote a book called \"The Language and Thought of the Child\", which aimed to synthesize the methods he was using in order to study the conclusion children drew from situations and how they arrived to such conclusion. The main idea was to observe how children responded and articulated certain situations with their own reasoning, in order to examine their thought processes (Mayer, 2005).\n\nPiaget administered a test in 15 boys with ages ranging from 10 to 14 years in which he asked participants to describe the relationship between a mixed bouquet of flowers and a bouquet with flowers of the same color. The purpose of this study was to analyze the thinking process the boys had and to draw conclusions about the logic processes they had used, which was a psychometric technique of research. Piaget also used the psychoanalytic method initially developed by Sigmund Freud. The purpose of using such method was to examine the unconscious mind, as well as to continue parallel studies using different research methods. Psychoanalysis was later rejected by Piaget, as he thought it was insufficiently empirical (Mayer, 2005).\n\nPiaget argued that children and adults used speech for different purposes. In order to confirm his argument, he experimented analyzing a child's interpretation of a story. In the experiment, the child listened to a story and then told a friend that same story in his/her/their own words. The purpose of this study was to examine how children verbalize and understand each other without adult intervention. Piaget wanted to examine the limits of naturalistic observation, in order to understand a child's reasoning. He realized the difficulty of studying children's thoughts, as it is hard to know if a child is pretending to believe their thoughts or not. Piaget was the pioneer researcher to examine children's conversations in a social context – starting from examining their speech and actions – where children were comfortable and spontaneous (Kose, 1987).\n\nAfter conducting many studies, Piaget was able to find significant differences in the way adults and children reason; however, he was still unable to find the path of logic reasoning and the unspoken thoughts children had, which could allow him to study a child's intellectual development over time (Mayer, 2005). In his third book, \"The Child's Conception of the World\", Piaget recognized the difficulties of his prior techniques and the importance of psychiatric clinical examination. The researcher believed that the way clinical examinations were conducted influenced how a child's inner realities surfaced. Children would likely respond according to the way the research is conducted, the questions asked, or the familiarity they have with the environment. The clinical examination conducted for his third book provides a thorough investigation into a child's thinking process. An example of a question used to research such process was: \"Can you see a thought?\" (Mayer, 2005, p. 372).\n\nPiaget recognized that psychometric tests had its limitations, as children were not able to provide the researcher with their deepest thoughts and inner intellect. It was also difficult to know if the results of child examination reflected what children believed or if it is just a pretend situation. For example, it is very difficult to know with certainty if a child who has a conversation with a toy believes the toy is alive or if the child is just pretending. Soon after drawing conclusions about psychometric studies, Piaget started developing the clinical method of examination. The clinical method included questioning a child and carefully examining their responses – in order to observe how the child reasoned according to the questions asked – and then examining the child's perception of the world through their responses. Piaget recognized the difficulties of interviewing a child and the importance of recognizing the difference between \"liberated\" versus \"spontaneous\" responses (Mayer, 2005, p. 372).\n\n\"The developmental theory of Jean Piaget has been criticized on the grounds that it is conceptually limited, empirically false, or philosophically and epistemologically untenable.\" Piaget responded to criticism by contending that the vast majority of critics did not understand the outcomes he wished to obtain from his research.\n\nAs Piaget believed development was a universal process, his initial sample sizes were inadequate, particularly in the formulation of his theory of infant development. Piaget's theories of infant development were based on his observations of his own three children. While this clearly presents problems with the sample size, Piaget also probably introduced confounding variables and social desirability into his observations and his conclusions based on his observations. It is entirely possible Piaget conditioned his children to respond in a desirable manner, so, rather than having an understanding of object permanence, his children might have learned to behave in a manner that indicated they understood object permanence. The sample was also very homogenous, as all three children had a similar genetic heritage and environment. Piaget did, however, have larger sample sizes during his later years.\n\nPiaget wanted to research in environments that would allow children to connect with some existing aspects of the world. The idea was to change the approach described in his book \"The Child's Conception of the World\" and move away from the vague questioning interviews. This new approach was described in his book \"The Child's Conception of Physical Causality\", where children were presented with dilemmas and had to think of possible solutions on their own. Later, after carefully analyzing previous methods, Piaget developed a combination of naturalistic observation with clinical interviewing in his book \"Judgment and Reasoning in the Child\", where a child's intellect was tested with questions and close monitoring. Piaget was convinced he had found a way to analyze and access a child's thoughts about the world in a very effective way (Mayer, 2005). Piaget's research provided a combination of theoretical and practical research methods and it has offered a crucial contribution to the field of developmental psychology (Beilin, 1992). \"Piaget is often criticized because his method of investigation, though somewhat modified in recent years, is still largely clinical\". He observes a child's surroundings and behavior. He then comes up with a hypothesis testing it and focusing on both the surroundings and behavior after changing a little of the surrounding.\n\nDespite his ceasing to be a fashionable psychologist, the magnitude of Piaget's continuing influence can be measured by the global scale and activity of the Jean Piaget Society, which holds annual conferences and attracts around 700 participants. His theory of cognitive development has proved influential in many different areas:\n\nPiaget is the most influential developmental psychologist to date, influencing not only the work of Lev Vygotsky and of Lawrence Kohlberg but whole generations of eminent academics. Although subjecting his ideas to massive scrutiny led to innumerable improvements and qualifications of his original model and the emergence of a plethora of neo-Piagetian and post-Piagetian variants, Piaget's original model has proved to be remarkably robust.\n\nBy using Piaget’s theory, educators focus on their students as learners. As a result of this focus, education is learner-center and constructivist-based to an extent. Piaget’s theory allows teachers to view students as individual learners who add new concepts to prior knowledge to construct, or build, understanding for themselves. Teachers who use a learner-centered approach as a basis for their professional practices incorporate the several dispositions. They provide experience-based educational opportunities. These teachers also contemplate the learners’ individual qualities and attitudes during curriculum planning. Educators allow learners’ insights to alter the curriculum. They nourish and support learners’ curiosity. They also involve learners’ emotions and create a learning environment in which students feel safe.\n\nThere are two differences between the preoperational and concrete operational stages that apply to education. These differences are reversibility and decentration. At times, reversibility and decentration occur at the same time. When students think about the steps to complete a task without using a particular logical, sequential order, they are using reversibility. Decentration allows them to concentrate on multiple components of a problematic task at a time. Students use both reversibility and decentration to function throughout the school day, follow directions, and complete assignments.\n\nAn example of a student using reversibility is when learning new vocabulary. The student creates a list of unfamiliar words from a literary text. Then, he researches the definition of those words before asking classmate to test him. His teacher has given a set of particular instructions that he must follow in a particular order: he must write the word before defining it, and complete these two steps repeatedly. A child in the preoperational stage gets confused during this process and needs assistance from the teacher to stay on task. The teacher refers him back to his text in order to notate the next word before he can define it. A child in the preoperational stage does not understand the organization required to complete this assignment. However, a child in the concrete operational stage understands the organization, and he can recall the steps in any order while being able to follow the order given. Using decentration, the child has the two activities on his mind: identify words and find them in the dictionary.\n\nA sample of decentration is a preschooler may use a toy banana as a pretend telephone. The child knows the difference between the fruit and a phone. However, in this form of play, he is operating on two levels at once. In an older child at the concrete operational level, decentration allows him to complete subtraction of two-digit numbers and indicate which of the problems also involved borrowing from the other column. The student simultaneously does both. Using reversibility, the student has to move mentally between two subtasks.\n\nRegarding the giving of praise by teachers, praise is a reinforcer for students. Adolescents undergo social-emotional development such that they seek rapport with peers. Thus, teacher praise is not as powerful for students who see teachers as authority figures. They give no value to praise provided by adults, or they have no respect for the individual who is giving praise.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, Piaget's works also inspired the transformation of European and American education, including both theory and practice, leading to a more ‘child-centered’ approach. In \"Conversations with Jean Piaget\", he says: \"Education, for most people, means trying to lead the child to resemble the typical adult of his society ... but for me and no one else, education means making creators... You have to make inventors, innovators—not conformists\" (Bringuier, 1980, p. 132).\n\nHis theory of cognitive development can be used as a tool in the early childhood classroom. According to Piaget, children developed best in a classroom with interaction.\n\nPiaget defined knowledge as the ability to modify, transform, and \"operate on\" an object or idea, such that it is understood by the operator through the process of transformation. Learning, then, occurs as a result of experience, both physical and logical, with the objects themselves and how they are acted upon. Thus, knowledge must be assimilated in an active process by a learner with matured mental capacity, so that knowledge can build in complexity by scaffolded understanding. Understanding is scaffolded by the learner through the process of equilibration, whereby the learner balances new knowledge with previous understanding, thereby compensating for \"transformation\" of knowledge.\n\nLearning, then, can also be supported by instructors in an educational setting. Piaget specified that knowledge cannot truly be formed until the learner has matured the mental structures to which that learning is specific, and thereby development constrains learning. Nevertheless, knowledge can also be \"built\" by building on simpler operations and structures that have already been formed. Basing operations of an advanced structure on those of simpler structures thus scaffolds learning to build on operational abilities as they develop. Good teaching, then, is built around the operational abilities of the students such that they can excel in their operational stage and build on preexisting structures and abilities and thereby \"build\" learning.\n\nEvidence of the effectiveness of a contemporary curricular design building on Piaget's theories of developmental progression and the support of maturing mental structures can be seen in Griffin and Case's \"Number Worlds\" curriculum. The curriculum works toward building a \"central conceptual structure\" of number sense in young children by building on five instructional processes, including aligning curriculum to the developmental sequencing of acquisition of specific skills. By outlining the developmental sequence of number sense, a conceptual structure is built and aligned to individual children as they develop.\n\nPiaget believed in two basic principles relating to moral education: that children develop moral ideas in stages and that children create their conceptions of the world. According to Piaget, \"the child is someone who constructs his own moral world view, who forms ideas about right and wrong, and fair and unfair, that are not the direct product of adult teaching and that are often maintained in the face of adult wishes to the contrary\" (Gallagher, 1978, p. 26). Piaget believed that children made moral judgments based on their own observations of the world.\n\nPiaget's theory of morality was radical when his book \"The Moral Judgment of the Child\" was published in 1932 for two reasons: his use of philosophical criteria to define morality (as universalizable, generalizable, and obligatory) and his rejection of equating cultural norms with moral norms. Piaget, drawing on Kantian theory, proposed that morality developed out of peer interaction and that it was autonomous from authority mandates. Peers, not parents, were a key source of moral concepts such as equality, reciprocity, and justice.\n\nPiaget attributed different types of psychosocial processes to different forms of social relationships, introducing a fundamental distinction between different types of said relationships. Where there is constraint because one participant holds more power than the other the relationship is asymmetrical, and, importantly, the knowledge that can be acquired by the dominated participant takes on a fixed and inflexible form. Piaget refers to this process as one of social transmission, illustrating it through reference to the way in which the elders of a tribe initiate younger members into the patterns of beliefs and practices of the group. Similarly, where adults exercise a dominating influence over the growing child, it is through social transmission that children can acquire knowledge. By contrast, in cooperative relations, power is more evenly distributed between participants so that a more symmetrical relationship emerges. Under these conditions, authentic forms of intellectual exchange become possible; each partner has the freedom to project his or her own thoughts, consider the positions of others, and defend his or her own point of view. In such circumstances, where children’s thinking is not limited by a dominant influence, Piaget believed \"the reconstruction of knowledge\", or favorable conditions for the emergence of constructive solutions to problems, exists. Here the knowledge that emerges is open, flexible and regulated by the logic of argument rather than being determined by an external authority.\n\nIn short, cooperative relations provide the arena for the emergence of operations, which for Piaget requires the absence of any constraining influence, and is most often illustrated by the relations that form between peers (for more on the importance of this distinction see Duveen & Psaltis, 2008; Psaltis & Duveen, 2006, 2007). This is thus how, according to Piaget, children learn \"moral judgement\" as opposed to \"cultural norms\" (or maybe ideological norms).\n\nHistorical changes of thought have been modeled in Piagetian terms. Broadly speaking these models have mapped changes in morality, intellectual life and cognitive levels against historical changes (typically in the complexity of social systems).\n\nNotable examples include:\n\nNeo-Piagetian stages have been applied to the maximum stage attained by various animals. For example, spiders attain the circular sensory motor stage, coordinating actions and perceptions. Pigeons attain the sensory motor stage, forming concepts.\n\nThe origins of human intelligence have also been studied in Piagetian terms. Wynn (1979, 1981) analysed Acheulian and Oldowan tools in terms of the insight into spatial relationships required to create each kind. On a more general level, Robinson's \"Birth of Reason\" (2005) suggests a large-scale model for the emergence of a Piagetian intelligence.\n\nPiaget's models of cognition have also been applied outside the human sphere, and some primatologists assess the development and abilities of primates in terms of Piaget's model.\n\nPhilosophers have used Piaget's work. For example, the philosopher and social theorist Jürgen Habermas has incorporated Piaget into his work, most notably in \"The Theory of Communicative Action.\" The philosopher Thomas Kuhn credited Piaget's work with helping him to understand the transition between modes of thought which characterized his theory of paradigm shifts. Yet, that said, it is also noted that the implications of his later work do indeed remain largely unexamined. Shortly before his death (September 1980), Piaget was involved in a debate about the relationships between innate and acquired features of language, at the Centre Royaumont pour une Science de l'Homme, where he discussed his point of view with the linguist Noam Chomsky as well as Hilary Putnam and Stephen Toulmin.\n\nPiaget also had a considerable effect in the field of computer science and artificial intelligence. Seymour Papert used Piaget's work while developing the Logo programming language. Alan Kay used Piaget's theories as the basis for the Dynabook programming system concept, which was first discussed within the confines of the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC). These discussions led to the development of the Alto prototype, which explored for the first time all the elements of the graphical user interface (GUI), and influenced the creation of user interfaces in the 1980s and beyond.\n\nPiaget's theory, however vital in understanding child psychology, did not go without scrutiny. A main figure whose ideas contradicted Piaget's ideas was the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky. Vygotsky stressed the importance of a child's cultural background as an effect to the stages of development. Because different cultures stress different social interactions, this challenged Piaget's theory that the hierarchy of learning development had to develop in succession. Vygotsky introduced the term Zone of proximal development as an overall task a child would have to develop that would be too difficult to develop alone.\n\nAlso, the so-called neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development maintained that Piaget's theory does not do justice either to the underlying mechanisms of information processing that explain transition from stage to stage or individual differences in cognitive development. According to these theories, changes in information processing mechanisms, such as speed of processing and working memory, are responsible for ascension from stage to stage. Moreover, differences between individuals in these processes explain why some individuals develop faster than other individuals (Demetriou, 1998).\n\nOver time, alternative theories of Child Development have been put forward, and empirical findings have done a lot to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during the first phase of the experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory.\n\nSee also Brian Rotman's \"Jean Piaget: Psychologist of the Real\", an exposition and critique of Piaget's ideas, and Jonathan Tudge and Barbara Rogoff's \"Peer influences on cognitive development: Piagetian and Vygotskian perspectives\".\n\n\n\nThe following groupings are based on the number of citations in Google Scholar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUNY pdf\nPiaget inspired innumerable studies and even new areas of inquiry. The following is a list of critiques and commentaries, organized using the same citation-based method as the list of his own major works (above). These represent the significant and influential post-Piagetian writings in their respective sub-disciplines.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is owned and operated by Kolab Systems AG and was formerly known as MyKolab.\n\nKolab Systems AG is the company behind the Kolab groupware suite. Founded in 2010 in Zürich, Switzerland, Kolab Systems has taken the place of the Kolab Konsortium which initially provided Kolab services primarily in German speaking areas from 2004 to 2010. It is also the largest contributor to the Roundcube web mailer project. The company's board of directors is composed of CEO Georg Greve, the founding president of Free Software Foundation Europe, CTO Jeroen van Meeuwen, Michael Moser, CCO and co-founder of Switzerlands leading Open Source Integrator Adfinis-SyGroup AG, and Philipp Koch, co-founder of Swiss hosting company Nine.ch.\n\nKolab Now, under the original name \"MyKolab\", was launched in January 2013 as a public beta release and became fully available later that year in August 1, as a paid service.\n\nAfter documents detailing United States and British government mass surveillance programs like PRISM and Tempora were leaked by Edward Snowden in May 2013, US-based companies Lavabit and Silent Circle, under pressure of government agencies, decided to shut down their email services rather than run the risk of having to disclose personal data of their users. In turn, Pamela Jones, author of now-defunct legal site Groklaw, revealed her use of MyKolab in her farewell post. Jones' endorsement increased demand for MyKolab.\n\nBased outside of the United States, Kolab Systems received media attention as one of the few and most secure alternatives still in operation.\n\nHosted in Switzerland, Kolab Now claims the benefit of strict privacy laws; it uses exclusively free or open source software, guaranteeing transparency. Because the service is subject to the national laws of Switzerland, Kolab Now states that there will be no access to a user's data by third parties without a duly authorized warrant issued by a Swiss judge. It is also stated in the terms of service that only the minimum of logs, necessary for debugging and improvement of the service, is kept.\n\nLike any company, Kolab Now can be obliged to provide access to lawful interception requests. However, the Swiss authorities are generally reluctant to make such requests for access, and the government publishes anonymised statistics of all such lawful interceptions along with the rationale.\n\nAs of 1 September 2015, Kolab Now reports having granted only one request from a government agency for data concerning a customer, and they note that this was an \"administrative request\", i.e. a request for information \"about\" a customer rather than a request for access to the customer's data. Kolab Now received two further requests but denied them because they came from an agency with no jurisdiction in Switzerland (both were from U.S. local police).\n\nIn 2012, in all of Switzerland, there were only 20 cases of real-time internet wire-tapping and a further 26 for retroactive communication meta-information. Swiss Federal Intelligence Service traditionally have no mandate to operate within the country. A controversial revision of the law, effective 1st September 2017, has recently given them wider license, in particular wholesale monitoring of cross-border traffic. According to Kolab Now, not much will change for its customers, however. ()\n\nKolab Now chose not to provide server-side encryption, and recommends using Kontact or Mozilla Thunderbird with Enigmail for proper end-to-end encryption. With server-side encryption, the encrypted data, the key, and the passphrase would need to pass through the web interface and be available on the server. Holding all three, the provider would have access to all the data despite the encryption.\n\nKolab Now offers 2 types of accounts: Individual and Group manager accounts.\n\nIt is aimed at the individual who wishes a more secure and private alternative to free email services, with full groupware functionality. There's the option of a Lite version, which offers the email service only and do not include the groupware synchronisation feature. Standard storage size for this account type ranges from 2 up to 100 GB, with cost incurring accordingly.\n\nThis account type provides the customer with an administration login, used purely to set up the actual groupware account within a domain under the customer's control, and to administrate users existing within that domain. It is also possible to use an own SSL Certificate for that domain. Cost is incurred per user in a similar fashion to the individual accounts.\n\nThe ActiveSync option allows to synchronize emails, contacts, events and tasks from Kolab Now to a mobile device. This works with all devices that support ActiveSync, such as Android, iPhone or Blackberry Z10. Alternatively, it is possible to use CalDAV and CardDAV capable clients to synchronise data.\n\nThe Kolab Client runs on all modern operating systems such as Linux, Windows and MacOS. It supports different applications such as Mail, Address Books, Calendars, ToDo Management, Journals, Notes and offers many detailed features for each of them. It is based on Kontact and uses the Qt Technology to be fully portable.\n\nIt is possible to define the criteria for emails to be filtered into different mail folders. The filtering will happen on the server right after the mail is received. This way emails are the same on all devices. Users can edit the filters as SIEVE scripts directly.\n\nAllows to see whether the participants of events are free or busy without revealing any information about what they are doing during these times. This allows to schedule appointments and ensure that everybody is able to participate.\n\nOther available features:\n\n\nKolab Now currently supports PayPal and Bitcoin as well as credit card as payment methods for monthly subscriptions and wire transfer for yearly payments only. The current monthly price for individual accounts with standard groupware functionality is 8.99 CHF, and for the email-only version, 4.55 CHF.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2064212", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2064212", "title": "Lawspeaker", "text": "Lawspeaker\n\nA lawspeaker or lawman (Swedish: \"lagman\", Old Swedish: \"laghmaþer\" or \"laghman\", Danish: \"lovsigemand\", Norwegian: \"lagmann\", Icelandic: \"lög(sögu)maður\", Faroese: \"løgmaður\", Finnish: \"laamanni\") is a unique Scandinavian legal office. It has its basis in a common Germanic oral tradition, where wise people were asked to recite the law, but it was only in Scandinavia that the function evolved into an office. Two of the most famous lawspeakers are Snorri Sturluson and Torgny the Lawspeaker.\n\nIn Sweden, this office was the most important one of regional governments, where each \"lagsaga\" (usually the same as the traditional province) was the jurisdiction of a lawspeaker who was subordinate to the lawspeaker of Tiundaland. The lawspeaker presided over the things, worked as a judge and formulated the laws that had been decided by the people. The lawspeaker was obliged to memorize the law and to recite it at the thing. He was also responsible for the administration at the thing and for the execution of the decisions, and it was his duty to safeguard the rights and liberties of the people and to speak in their behalf to the king or his representative. It was the lawspeaker who, on the behalf of the people, recognized the elected king when he passed on the Eriksgata. However, after the establishment of the province laws, ca 1350, he would participate at the Stone of Mora with twelve companions from his jurisdiction.\n\nAccording to the Westrogothic law, the lawspeaker was appointed for life by the yeomen (\"bönder\") of the province from among their number; it was also stipulated that his father should also have been an landowner. The office was not hereditary, but he was usually selected from the more powerful families.\n\nThe first named Swedish lawspeaker, if the text is correct, is the Lum recorded in a register of Västergötland lawmen copied by Laurentius Dyakn, a priest in Vidhem, in the 1320s; he must have lived around 1000. The first Swedish lawspeaker for whom we have substantial biographical information is Eskil (c. 1175-1227), the seventeenth in Laurentius's list. From the mid-13th century and onwards, the lawspeakers became more attached to the king, and it was common that lawspeakers were members of the king's council. King Magnus Eriksson decided that the king would influence the appointment of the lawspeakers. Six nobles and six yeomen would in consultation with two clergymen appoint three men from the jurisdiction among whom the king would select the one he deemed to be most fit. This procedure would be in effect until the 16th century when the whole process of selection was transferred to the king.\n\nFrom then on, the lawspeakers only came from the nobility, and it had turned into a pension, in which a member of the Privy Council of Sweden was selected and received a salary, but had other people taking care of the work. This privilege was abolished during the Reduction of 1680, after which the lawspeakers were obliged to take care of the work themselves, and there were checks on the appointment of members of the privy council. Still, the appointment remained restricted to noblemen until 1723.\n\nBy then, the functions of the office had become restricted to that of a judge, a function which also became less important by time. In 1849, the office was abolished, but the title remained occasionally in use as a title of honour for governors.\n\nIn 1947, the title of \"lagman\" (pl. \"lagmän\") was reintroduced for senior judges, namely the presidents of divisions of the courts of appeal. Since reform in 1969, presidents of the district courts (\"tingsrätter\") are \"lagmän\", while presidents of divisions of the courts of appeal are \"hovrättslagmän\" (\"court of appeal lawspeakers\"). Correspondingly, presidents of the district administrative courts (\"förvaltningsrätter\") also carry the title of \"lagman\" and presidents of divisions of the administrative courts of appeal are \"kammarrättslagmän\" (\"administrative court of appeal lawspeakers\").\n\nFinland being governed by Swedish law wholly until 1809, the events were the same as in Sweden. However, the \"lagman\" offices were terminated and \"lagman\" became an honorific title only in 1868 (at that time laws were published also in Finnish and thus also the term \"laamanni\" official). In the 1993 reform, \"laamanni\" and \"lagman\" were reintroduced as the title of the chief judge of a district court or a senior judge in a court of appeal.\n\nIn Norway, the lawspeakers remained counselors versed in the law until king Sverre I of Norway (1184–1202) made them into his officials. In the laws of Magnus VI of Norway (1263–80), they were given the right to function as judges and to preside at the lagtings (the Norwegian superior courts). Modern historians regard the lawspeakers in ancient times (especially before around 1600), of which there were 10–12 in the entire kingdom, as part of the nobility. In the 14th and 15th centuries they were usually recruited from the existing higher nobility, with some holding the rank of knight, the highest rank of nobility in the kingdom. In the 16h century they were still usually recruited from the existing nobility, albeit more often from the lower nobility. Lawspeakers received fiefs. For example, Marker fief was by tradition held by the lawspeaker of Oslo. They were also treated as equal to the nobility on formal occasions.\n\nThe historical lagtings and the office of lawspeaker were abolished in 1797, but the title was reinstituted in 1887 together with the introduction of the jury system.\n\nIn Iceland, the office was introduced in 930, when the Althing was established. He was elected for three years. Besides his function as the president of the thing, his duties were restricted to counselling and to reciting the law. It was the sole government office of the mediaeval Icelandic Commonwealth. The lawspeaker was elected for a term of three years and was supposed to declaim the law at the Althing, a third of it each summer. In fact, Grímr Svertingsson's term was cut short, not because of incompetence or illness, but because his voice was too weak for the job. Apart from his function as a lawsayer and chairman of the court, the \"lǫgsǫgumaðr\" had no formal power, but he would often be appointed as an arbitrator in the frequently arising disputes. The office lingered on for a few years in the transitional period after 1262, after which it was replaced with a \"lǫgmaðr\". The traditional date for the founding of the Althing is 930 with Úlfljótr appearing as a founding figure and the original author of the laws. After the union with Norway in 1264, two royal lawspeakers were appointed who had an important influence on the legal processes at the thing. The office was abolished together with the Althing in 1800.\n\nScholars are suspicious of the fact that Úlfljótur's first two successors have been assigned a period in office of exactly 20 summers each, but from \"Þorkell máni\" on, the chronology is probably correct; names are given in their modern Icelandic form.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5463204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5463204", "title": "Liō", "text": "Liō\n\nLiō is a daily comic strip created by American artist Mark Tatulli and distributed by the Universal Press Syndicate since May 15, 2006. As a pantomime strip, it has an international appeal. In 2008, the strip brought Tatulli a National Cartoonists Society Newspaper Comic Strip Award.\n\nThe strip focuses on the adventures of a creative little boy, Liō, who lives with his father (unnamed in the strip) and various monsters, animals, aliens, lab creations, and other creatures. Liō's mother is deceased. It is currently unknown how she died. The setting of the story varies from Liō's house to his school and the general outside world. The time period appears to be contemporary, except for an episode set in the year 2101, when Liō is in his nineties but still very much capable of mischief.\n\nThe story is told visually, with little or no dialogue. Gags frequently involve the supernatural, alien invasion or mass destruction of many sorts, creating a surreal, disturbing atmosphere. Some of the strip's recurring themes involve Liō getting even with grade-school bullies, helping animals (most of which are non-anthropomorphic but display obvious intelligence) defend themselves against humans or their predators, and performing mad scientist style experiments. He is often seen using robots that he constructs himself for causing mischief. Another recurring gag in the strip is parody of other famous comic strips, including \"Cathy\", \"For Better or For Worse\", \"Garfield\", \"Zits\", \"Calvin and Hobbes\", \"Blondie\", \"Peanuts\", \"Pearls Before Swine\", \"The Family Circus\" and Berkeley Breathed's strips.\n\nIn addition to Liō, the strip only has one other major character, Liō's unnamed father. He is frequently shown to be the subject of Liō's pranks, and sometimes he has to get his son out of difficult situations. When he watched a news report of an alien invasion, he gave Liō a spanking for apparently having piloted the alien ship and parking it in the backyard (dated at 2007/02/09). On the other hand, one day when the boy came home from school dejected because a drawing he created had horrified the faculty, Dad proudly hung up the piece of art on the refrigerator, giving his son much-needed comfort and joy (dated 2009/03/15). Quite often, father and son prove that they really love each other, no matter what.\n\nLiō has at least five companion animals: \n\nThere are several frequently recurring characters:\n\nWhile it may seem that all the strips are from Liō's imagination, Tatulli has stated that all events in the strip actually happen to Liō, (Although on the back cover of an AMP! Kids Liō book, There's a monster in my socks, they say all the monsters and robots are from his imagination.) though most of the time others turn a blind eye to it, unlike the other-worldly situations in \"Calvin and Hobbes\".\n\nAnother notable aspect of \"Liō\" (reminiscent of such strips as \"The Little King\", \"Henry\" and \"Ferd'nand\") is its general lack of dialogue, though there are occasional vocalizations (such as \"Eeck!\" or \"Aggh!\") and there are labels on certain objects to make the gags more obvious. One-time characters have sometimes spoken, and characters in some of the parodies have had dialogue even when Liō himself is silent.\n\nTatulli has credited Gahan Wilson, Charles Addams and U.S. Civil War era caricaturist Adalbert J. Volck as influences on the visual style of \"Liō\".\n\nThe strip debuted on May 15, 2006 in more than 100 newspapers which included \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\", \"The Dallas Morning News\", \"Detroit Free Press\", \"Houston Chronicle\", \"Los Angeles Times\", Denver's \"Rocky Mountain News\", \"Raleigh News and Observer\", \"The Seattle Times\", \"St. Petersburg Times\" and \"The Washington Post\". The strip is mostly wordless, therefore it can easily be marketed worldwide; one paper, \"De Morgen\", a Brussels-based Flemish newspaper, introduced the strip on the day it debuted. \nAs of August 2007, \"Liō\" runs in more than 330 newspapers worldwide.\n\nAn October 23, 2007 article in \"Variety\" revealed that the strip had been optioned for a live-action feature film by producer David Kirschner.\nBut as of 2017 there has been no word if the film started production.\n\n"}

Stone\n\nMichael Edward Stone (born 22 October 1938) is a professor emeritus of Armenian Studies and of Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He is also a published poet.\n\nMichael Stone was born in Leeds, England in 1938. In 1941 his family moved to Sydney, Australia, where he was raised. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Melbourne in Semitic Studies and the Classics during the years 1956–1960. He immigrated to Israel in 1960. His father, Julius Stone, was a professor of International Law at the University of Sydney and the first chairman of the Truman Institute at the Hebrew University.\n\nAfter a year-long acclimation program at the Hebrew University (1960–61), Stone transferred to Harvard University in the United States and there completed a doctorate under Professor Frank M. Cross in the Department of Near Eastern Languages during the years 1961–65. His doctorate addressed the conception of eschatology in 4 Ezra. Afterwards he became a lecturer in Comparative Religion at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 1966 he returned to Israel, became a lecturer in Comparative Religion at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and in the following year became an associate professor. In 1980 he became a full professor of Armenian Studies and was named as the Gail Levin de Nur Professor of Religious Studies. In 2007 he retired from the Hebrew University, where he continues his research and lecturing as a professor emeritus.\n\nStone held many visiting research and professorial positions at academic institutions worldwide. He was (according to chronology) assistant professor of religious studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara (1965–66), lecturer in Jewish studies and Armenian studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1966–69), senior lecturer in the same (1969–76), visiting research fellow at Harvard University (1971–72), George Scott Fellow at Ormond College of the University of Melbourne (summer of 1974), visiting member of the Theological Faculty at Leiden University (summer of 1975), associate professor at the Hebrew University (1976–80), the Berg Professor of Judaic Studies (1977–78) and the Tarzian Adjunct Professor of Armenian History and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania (1977–83), fellow-in-residence (1980–81) and visiting scholar (autumn of 1984) at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies, distinguished visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania (summer 1985), visiting scholar at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies (summer of 1986), distinguished visiting fellow at Ormond College of the University of Melbourne (spring of 1988), visiting professor of Jewish studies at Harvard Divinity School (fall of 1989), visiting professor at Yale University (autumn of 1991), Distinguished NEH Visiting professor at the University of Richmond (spring 1993), visiting professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia (1993), fellow-in-residence and the director of a research group on translation techniques at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Studies (1997–98), visiting professor of New Testament and Judaic studies at Harvard University (autumn of 2001), distinguished senior visiting fellow in the Kluge Center of the Library of Congress (autumn 2003), the Sugden Distinguished Visiting fellow at Queen’s College of the University of Melbourne (summer of 2004), and distinguished visiting professor of Judaic studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (2006–07).\n\nHe is a member of the editorial board of the journal, Revue des Études Arméniennes (Paris), served as a member of the scientific board of Patmabanasirakan Handes (Erevan) and as a member of the editorial board of Dead Sea Discoveries. He is a founder of the Society of Biblical Literature Pseudepigrapha Group (USA) and was a member of the steering committee.\n\nHe married Nira Weintraub in 1961. She was a scholar in the history of Byzantine and Armenian art, a field in which she taught for many years at the Hebrew University. They have two children and six grandchildren. Nira died in the summer of 2013.\n\nStone has written and published many poems in English, and he is a member of the Israel Association of Writers in English.\n\nMichael Stone is first and foremost a historian of religious thought. His research focuses on two fields: Jewish thought and literature of the Second Temple period including its transmission into the Middle Ages; and Armenian Studies. His work emphasizes texts and their interpretations but extends beyond a narrow textual focus to ideological analysis within religious and intellectual history.\n\nCredited with “single-handedly pioneer[ing] the study of the Armenian language, literature and history,” Stone’s research has focused on several topics within this subject:\n\nStone has published several books dealing with Jewish literature translated to Armenian.\n\nIn his book, The Armenian Version of 4 Ezra, Stone published the first full critical edition of any text connected with the Armenian biblical canon. Following its publication, Stone produced several volumes of texts and exegesis addressing biblical or Jewish traditions. These volumes contain manuscript texts edited anew including the first editions of documents that were beforehand unknown. In this vein, many of Stone’s articles are dedicated to the publication of texts, and in so doing he established a wide body of texts that were important both for Armenian and Pseudepigrapha Studies.\n\nHe published the first edition of the Armenian version of the Armenian Adam book, The Penitence of Adam in 1981. In so doing, he initiated long-term research on the deuterocanonical books dealing with Adam and Eve, which he collected over the past decade. He published concordances of Armenian deuterocanonical literature about Adam (1996, 2001) and additional literature related to Armenians and other Adam traditions (mentioned below).\n\nWith these publications Stone initiated a new field of study and research: deuterocanonical literature in Armenian, which is the transmission of biblical and Jewish traditions in Armenian. In so doing he had lasting influence on Armenian Studies as well as the study of deuterocanonical literature. In recent years he has focused on the way in which these traditions function within the Armenian culture and how their transformation reflects changes in the religious and intellectual history of the Armenian nation. He presents diachronic questions that were never before posed and traces shifts of religious, intellectual, and cultural history that were hardly addressed. These questions touch on understanding the human condition and existential purpose. Furthermore, the diachronic research of entire traditions highlights changes that occurred in Armenian thought throughout generations and ties them to Armenian history, politics, religion, and thought. Here he attends to ancient Jewish elements in Armenian culture.\n\nStone’s interest in Armenian manuscripts led him to study the Armenian script. He published a number of technical descriptions of manuscripts and co-published with Dr. Nira Stone the Catalogue of the New Armenian Manuscripts in the Chester Beatty Library, Dublin. He edited and published Armenian graffiti from Sinai in a significant work of historical, epigraphic, and linguistic consequences. The inscriptions shed light on ancient Armenian pilgrimage, on the character of the pilgrims, and on their linguistic usages. His research tied into Armenian graffiti in Nazareth. He proved that a portion of the inscriptions in Sinai and Nazareth are the oldest Armenian script in the world and were inscribed within decades of the creation of the Armenian alphabet (early fifth century CE).\n\nStone published numerous Armenian inscriptions from the Land of Israel and made several significant discoveries regarding Armenian pilgrimage and monasticism in the Holy Land. He was the editor in chief of The Album of Armenian Paleography, a large project that exhibits and analyzes the development of the Armenian script beginning with the most ancient dated manuscripts and up until the nineteenth century. In the course of preparing this work he devised techniques for producing script tables directly from digital images of the manuscripts themselves. On one side of each opening there is a picture of the manuscript; on the other there is a copy of a segment of the text, paleographic discussion, and bibliography. At the end of the book appear development tables.\n\nWith Israeli archeologist Dr. David Amit, Stone researched and published on a medieval Jewish cemetery of southern Armenia. This thirteenth-century cemetery is akin to no other – not only in terms of Armenia but of the oriental-Jewish communities. On the tombstones there are inscriptions in both Hebrew and Aramaic that teach about the life of the Jewish community in southern Armenia, about which there was no information previously. His research on the Jews of Armenia continues today.\n\nStone recognized very early on the potential of computer applications for Armenian studies. In 1971 he completed his first computer-aided research in Armenian. Since then he has used a computer application to compare manuscripts to produce scientific editions of texts as well as concordances. He wrote books in other fields of Armenian Studies; for example, the publication of his research with M.E. Shirinian dealing with the edition, translation, and exegesis of an ancient philosophical work preserved only in Armenian and with R.R. Ervine on patristics.\n\nOn this subject Stone dealt with a range of topics. Among the specific documents that he researched are 4 Ezra, the Aramaic Levi Document, the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs, Enoch and Noah literature, and literature relating to Adam and Eve. In the field of history of religious thought he has worked especially on apocalyptic literature and also on issues dealing with the central characteristics of Judaism of that period. He has also written monographs and articles on many other subjects in the field.\n\nThis text was the subject of Stone’s research for twenty-five years, the culmination of which was his exegesis of 4 Ezra, published in 1990. This work was written originally in Hebrew approximately thirty years after the destruction of the Second Temple and translated into Greek. From this Greek version it was translated into other languages: Latin, Ethiopic, Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, and Georgian. None of the Hebrew versions have been preserved and only fragments of the Greek, and for the vast majority of the text there remains to the present day only the translations from Greek, on which Stone worked. His book features detailed interpretation of the verses together with a wider analysis of the literary dynamic and religious worldview of the author as revealed in the text’s content and presentation of topics. Over the years he wrote a series of articles on 4 Ezra, including the significance of structure, its notion of divine justice, as well as mystical and exegetical elements. These studies have been called “groundbreaking” by other researchers in the field.\n\nStone published two collections of articles on 4 Ezra and other dimensions of Second Temple Judaism. A prominent factor of his exegetical approach to ancient texts is the idea that descriptions of religious phenomena may represent actual experiences of the author or of the circle from which he/she came. This approach considers the religious experience of the author as a factor for researching ancient religious literature.\n\nHe also published the Armenian version separately (mentioned above) as well as his doctoral thesis on the text’s eschatology (1989). In the course of his research he led the study of apocalyptic literature on topics relating to ancient religious thought.\n\nAlong with his research on 4 Ezra, Stone published the Armenian text of The Testament of Levi (1969). After many years of work, he published a critical Armenian edition of all twelve testaments of the sons of Jacob with the help of his former student, Dr. Vered Hillel (2012). Towards the end of the 1960s he commenced cooperation with Professor Jonas Greenfield regarding the Aramaic apocrypha, which continued until Greenfield’s death in 1995. Together and separately, they published a series of articles that arose from their research, including some addressing the Enoch literature. Since then, Stone published their joint edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls fragments of The Testament of Levi in the DJD series. With Dr. Esther Eshel, Stone completed his and Greenfield’s translation, exegesis, and research on this third- or second-century BCE work. The work survives in fragments transmitted in Jewish and Christian channels, including the Cairo Geniza, a Greek manuscript, and Dead Sea fragments. They arranged scattered segments and wrote exegeses.\n\nThe research on the Book of Enoch led Stone to become interested in the Dead Sea Scrolls. He wrote on the relationship between the Pseudepigrapha and Qumran literature, classification of the Jewish literature in the days of the Second Temple, and related topics.\n\nWith Esther Eshel he edited the 4Q464 manuscript, and with Esther Chazon a fragmentary work on the end times. Likewise, in his edition of fragments from the Testament of Naphtali, Stone showed that the fragment found at Qumran was included in altered form in the Greek Testament of Naphtali. Rabbi Moshe ha-Darshan, author of the Midrash Genesis Rabbati (France, eleventh century) knew of a similar or identical document to the Qumran one in a semitic language. From this the question of literary transmission from the days of the Second Temple to the Middle Ages arose acutely.\n\nStone founded the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls at the Hebrew University in 1995 and directed it during its early years.\n\nToward the end of the 1990s, Stone returned to a subject he discussed in his earliest articles: the Armenian apocryphal “Death of Adam.”\n\nAfter publication of his commentary on 4 Ezra he turned to the apocryphal literature of Adam and Eve. In 1992 he wrote, A History of the Literature of Adam and Eve, and in 1999 he published a book on the subject with Professor Gary Anderson. With Anderson, he also published a collection of studies on the Adam literature (2000) and books on other aspects of the Adam and Eve literature.\n\nThe book, Adam’s Contract with Satan, deals with a tradition of Adam and Eve preserved in Slavic, Armenian, Georgian, modern Greek, and others. He followed the spread of this legend, which has it that after Adam and Eve left the Garden of Eden, they sinned a second time due to Satan deceiving them. That being the case, the post-lapsarian state of human beings in the world may be explained on two levels: 1—why we are not in the Garden of Eden based on the book of Genesis; 2—the fate of humans in the world is the outcome not of sin, but of deception (i.e., Satan deceived them). Subscribers to this perspective on the world see it differently than those that attribute it to the sin of Adam and Eve alone or to original sin, as in Western Christianity.\n\nIn this field Stone has delved into the character and phenomenology of Jewish apocryphal literature, a subject that occupied scholarship especially in the 1970s and 1980s. The conceptual innovations and insight contained in Stone’s writing on Second Temple Judaism (such as the transition from oral to written literature, the sociological approach to understanding the wisdom teacher, and questions pertaining to the pseudepigrapha) left a lasting impression on modern perceptions of the primary sources. His work in this field is published mainly in articles. Stone’s abilities and interests as a historian of religion are most prominent in this area of his research. His chief articles addressing these topics were gathered in two collections.\n\nToday Stone pursues several research endeavors in the field: he has just completed a comprehensive investigation of Adam and Eve in the Armenian tradition (2013); he is preparing to publish many Armenian inscriptions from Jerusalem; and he is working on a book that will include previously unknown documents in Armenian about biblical figures.\n\nStone collected photographs of graffiti inscriptions in many languages in the Sinai, the Negev, and the Christian holy places. He himself published much of the Armenian material documented during the project. This material has been mounted online at rockinscriptions.huji.ac.il.\n\nIn 1995, Stone founded the Orion Center for the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls at the Hebrew University for the purpose of integrating new information from the scrolls with previous knowledge about Second Temple Judaism. Today, the Center is one of the important research institutes on the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nStone founded the International Association of Armenian Studies (Association Internationale des Etudes Armésniennes) in 1980, held the office of president until 2000, and since then is the honorary president. Membership in the organization, limited to researchers in the field, numbers today more than 200. It is the leading organization for Armenian Studies.\n\nWith the Israeli archeologist Dr. David Amit, Stone oversaw the excavation of the Jewish cemetery in Armenia and the publishing of the inscriptions.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2648829", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2648829", "title": "Munsee language", "text": "Munsee language\n\nMunsee (also known as Munsee Delaware, Delaware, Ontario Delaware) is an endangered language of the Eastern Algonquian subgroup of the Algonquian language family, itself a branch of the Algic language family. Munsee is one of the two Delaware languages (also known as Lenape languages, after the tribe's autonym). It is very closely related to the extinct Unami Delaware, but the two are sufficiently different that they are considered separate languages. Munsee was spoken aboriginally in the vicinity of the modern New York City area in the United States, including western Long Island, Manhattan Island, Staten Island, as well as adjacent areas on the mainland: southeastern New York State, the northern third of New Jersey, and northeastern Pennsylvania.\n\nAs of 2009, Munsee was spoken only on the Moraviantown Reserve in Ontario, Canada, by two elderly individuals, aged 77 and 90, in 2018. The language that the individuals speak differs between speakers, each having a personal dialect. There has been interest in learning the language by younger individuals.\n\nMunsee is an Eastern Algonquian language, which is the sole recognized genetic subgroup descending from Proto-Algonquian, the common ancestor language of the Algonquian language family. Munsee is very closely related to Unami Delaware. Munsee and Unami constitute the Delaware languages, comprising a subgroup within Eastern Algonquian. Taken together with Mahican, the Delaware languages constitute \"Delawaran,\" a subgroup within Eastern Algonquian.\n\nThe term Munsee developed as an English name for the aggregated group that formed along the upper Delaware River north of the Delaware Water Gap. Other Munsee dialect speakers joined the Minisink group; the earliest recorded mention of Munsee dates from 1725. Minisink is a Munsee term meaning \"at the island\", and is to be transcribed \"mə̆nə́sənk.\" It is the locative form of a now disused word /mənə́s/ \"island\"; cognates in other Algonquian languages are e.g. Ojibwe \"minis\", \"island\". Orthographic in the form Minisink is the modern Munsee locative suffix (discussed below in the Grammar section). The term \"Munsee\" is the English adaptation of a regularly formed word \"mə́n'si·w\" (person from Minisink).\n\nOver time the British extended the term Munsee to any speaker of the Munsee language. Attempts to derive \"Munsee\" from a word meaning \"stone\" or \"mountain,\" as proposed by Brinton, are incorrect. Kraft's claim that \"Munsee\" is not an indigenous term, and that it results from a \"corruption\" of English use of Minisink is incorrect. The term follows a regular pattern of Munsee word formation.\n\nNames for the speakers of Munsee are used in complex ways in both English and in Munsee. The Unami language is sometimes treated as \"Delaware\" or \"Delaware proper\", reflecting the original application of the term Delaware to Unami speakers, but Munsee speakers use \"Delaware\" as a self-designation in English. The term Delaware was originally applied by British colonists to Unami speakers living along the Delaware River, which is named after Lord De La Warr, the first governor of Virginia. The term was gradually extended to refer to all Delaware groups.\n\nThe Munsee in Ontario are sometimes referred to as \"Ontario Delaware\" or \"Canadian Delaware\". Munsee-speaking residents of Moraviantown use the English term \"Munsee\" to refer to residents of Munceytown, approximately to the east. In English, Moraviantown residents call themselves \"Delaware\", and in Munsee \"Delaware person, Indian\".\n\nSome Delaware at Moraviantown also use the term Christian Indian as a preferred self-designation in English. The equivalent Munsee term is \"ké·ntə̆we·s\" (\"one who prays, Moravian convert\"). Munsee speakers refer to Oklahoma Delaware as \"Unami\" in English or /wə̆ná·mi·w/ in Munsee. The English term \"Lenape\" is of Unami origin, and is used in English as a self-designation by speakers of Unami;\n\nExceptionally among scholars, Kraft uses Lenape as an English-language cover term to refer to all Delaware-speaking groups, while noting that this usage is \"not entirely appropriate\".\n\nMunsee speakers refer to their language as /hə̀lə̆ni·xsəwá·kan/, literally \"speaking the Delaware language\".\n\nSpeakers of Munsee originally resided in the greater Manhattan area, the drainage of the Lower Hudson River valley, and the upper Delaware River. The arrival of European explorers, traders and settlers resulted in the progressive displacement of Munsee people over a period of several centuries. Munsee groups affected by this process ultimately moved away from their homeland to communities in both the United States and Canada.\n\nIn the twentieth century, surviving Munsee speakers in Canada lived at Six Nations, Ontario; Munceytown, Ontario; and Moraviantown Reserve. Now extinct in the first two locations, the language is used only by a few elders at Moraviantown, Ontario.\n\nSince the early 21st century, the language has been taught to tribal members of the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohican Native Americans, the Ramapough Mountain Indians and the Delaware Nation, Moraviantown Reserve.\n\nThe southern boundary of Munsee territory was the area north of the Delaware Water Gap, following the river system southeast along the Raritan River to the Atlantic Ocean. To the south of the Munsee were the Unami Delaware. To the north were the Algonquian Mahican, and to the east were the Eastern Long Island peoples, who also spoke Algonquian languages, such as Unquachog (also spelled Unkechaug) and southern New England languages, such as Quiripi. (Quiripi and Unquachog are likely members of a dialect continuum of a single language.)\n\nAboriginally, and for a period subsequent to the arrival of Europeans, Munsee was spoken within a series of small and largely autonomous local bands, located primarily within the drainage of the Hudson and upper Delaware rivers, the major river systems of the area. The general pattern, found throughout the Eastern Algonquian area, was one in which indigenous groups resided along the drainages of major river systems, with divisions between upriver and downriver groupings. Named groups were found on the major tributaries; they developed larger sites on the main streams and smaller camps at the headwaters and on feeder streams. Estimates vary, but these local groups may have had a population of up to two hundred people each. These groups spoke localized varieties of the language now called Munsee, but there is little information on dialect variation within the Munsee-speaking area.\n\nThe primary known named Munsee groups, from north to south on the west side of the Hudson River, were the \n\nThe Wappinger were to the east of the upper Hudson; below them going north to south on the east bank of the Hudson were the \n\nThe disruptions resulting from the entry of European settlers, fur traders, and explorers led to the displacement of these local groups. They gradually consolidated into larger groups that brought together speakers from the different groups within the Munsee-speaking area.\n\nMunsee phonology is complex but regular in many regards. Metrical rules of syllable weight assignment play a key role in the assignment of word-level stress, and also determine the form of rules of vowel Syncope that produce complex but mostly regular alternations in the forms of words. Word-level stress is largely predictable, with exceptions occurring primarily in loan words, reduplicated forms, and in words where historical change has made historically transparent alternations more opaque.\n\nMunsee has the following inventory of consonants; International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) values are given in brackets.\n\nSome loan words from English contain /f/ and /r/: \"fé·li·n\" 'there is a fair going on'; \"ntáyrəm\" 'my tire.'\n\nDifferent analyses of the Munsee vowel system have been proposed. Goddard (1979) presents an analysis in which Munsee and Unami have the same vowel system, unchanged from the Proto-Eastern-Algonquian vowel system (discussed in the \"History\" section below). In this analysis, there are four long vowels /i·, o·, e·, a·/ and two short vowels /a, ə/. Vowel length is indicated with a raised dot (·). However, in modern Munsee there are several sources of new short /i, o, e/ that arise from such sources as reduplication, loan words, and other various phonological changes, and that cannot be derived from other underlying vowels. Hence an analysis in which there are four positions that have contrastive vowel length as well as /ə/, is appropriate.\n\nThe short vowel has the phonetic value . Short has values centring on , with occurring before (where 'C' represents any stop or the lateral consonant). Short has values centring on . The long vowels have the primary values , , , and , with varying to , and after labial consonants.\n\nSyllable weight plays a significant role in Munsee phonology, determining stress placement and the deletion of certain short vowels. All syllables containing long vowels are \"strong.\" Any short vowel in a closed syllable (i.e. (C)VC) is strong. Counting left to right, in a sequence of two or more open syllables containing short vowels, the odd-numbered syllable is \"weak\" and the even-numbered syllable is strong. As well, certain syllables containing short vowels (frequently such syllables occur in reduplicated syllables and loan words) must exceptionally be marked as strong.\n\nIn words longer than two syllables, the final syllable is excluded from consideration of stress placement, i.e. is extrametrical, and the last strong syllable preceding the final syllable in the word receives the main stress.\n\nIn disyllabic words a strong penultimate syllable receives primary stress.\n\nIn a disyllable with a weak penultimate syllable, the final syllable is strong, and receives primary stress.\n\nThe grammar of Munsee is characterized by complex inflectional and derivational morphology. Inflection in Munsee is realized through the use of prefixes and suffixes added to word stems to indicate grammatical information, including number (singular or plural), gender, person, possession, negation, obviation, and others.\n\nNouns use combinations of person prefixes and suffixes to indicate possession, and suffixes to indicate gender, number, diminutive, absentative, and obviation.\n\nVerbs use a single set of person prefixes and a series of suffixes in position classes following the verb stem to indicate combinations of person, number, negation, obviation, and others.\n\nThere is no standard writing system for Munsee. Linguists have tended to use common phonetic transcription symbols of the type found in the International Phonetic Alphabet or similar Americanist symbols in order to represent sounds that are not consistently represented in conventional standard writing systems.\n\nEuropeans writing down Delaware words and sentences have tended to use adaptations of European alphabets and associated conventions. The quality of such transliterated renditions have varied widely, as Europeans attempted to record sounds and sound combinations they were not familiar with.\n\nA practical orthography for Munsee has been created in the context of various language preservation and documentation projects. A recent bilingual dictionary of Munsee uses a practical orthography derived from a linguistic transcription system for Munsee. The same system is also used in a recent word book produced locally at Moraviantown. The related Unami language is written using a distinct practical orthography.\n\nThe table below presents a sample of Munsee words, written first in a linguistically oriented transcription, followed by the same words written in a practical system. The linguistic system uses a raised dot (·) to indicate vowel length. Although stress is mostly predictable, the linguistic system uses the acute accent to indicate predictable main stress. As well, predictable voiceless or murmured /ă/ is indicated with the breve accent (˘). Similarly, the breve accent is used to indicate an ultra-short that typically occurs before a single voiced consonant followed by a vowel.\n\nThe practical system indicates vowel length by doubling the vowel letter, and maintains the linɡuistic system's practices for marking stress and voiceless/ultra-short vowels. The practical system uses orthographic for the phonetic symbol /š/, and for the phonetic symbol /č/.\n\nCurrently, the Munsee language has 8 native speakers whose personal dialects vary from each other. Extensive details about how the language differs between all 8 speakers have been cataloged in a paper by Ives Goddard titled \"The Personal Dialects of Moraviantown Delaware\" which was published in Anthropological Linguistics volume 52.\n\nNouns and verbs that end in -i•w, -e•w and -a•w, some speakers often dropped the -w. This drop also carried over into \"careful speech\".\n\nA large class of particles and pre-words that are usually heard with final /-ɘ/ retained the original /-i/ in the speech of some speakers.\n\nWords that end with the negative suffix /-wi/ or the subjunctive suffix /-e/ had variants with final /-ɘ/.\n\nAnother large class of particles and pre-words are found in older sources ending in /-Í·wi/, e.g.\n\nSome words have variation between underlying | a | and | ə |. It is possible to determine which vowel is older and which might be the innovation by using evidence from other Algonquin languages, other Munsee communities and earlier sources.\n\nAn initial and three words show variation between short and long vowels. These words are:\n\n\"ans ~ a·ns- '\" scoop\"': ánsham ~ á•nsham\" 'he dips up water'\n\n\"me•xalapó•ti•s ~ me•xa•làpó•ti-s\" 'spider'\n\n\"wekó•li•s ~ we•kó•li•s\" 'whippoorwill'\n\n\"yankw(ǎ)té•ho•n ~ ya•nkw(ă)té•ho•n\" 'apron'\n\nTwo words have | nš | varying with | nč |.\"T\"\n\nThese words are \"xwaskó-nšəy ~ xwaskó-nčəy\" 'corncob' and \"sànǎkó-nšə̃yak ~ sànǎkó-nčə̃yak\" 'elderberries'.\n\nA number of cases are present where one segment varies or is variably present.\n\nFor example, / t / is replaced by / k / in \"le•làpatíhte•k\" (etc.) ~ \"le•làpatíhke•k\" (etc.) 'juneberry'.\n\nSome nouns are found with and without a final /-əw/.\n\nIn two bird names, | l | varies with | n |.\n\nFor example: '\"taskãmális -~ taskamáni•s \"'kingfisher' ; \"ši•wa•pé•kăli•š ~ ši•wa•pé•kăni•š\" 'bluebird\"'.\"\n\nSome words have more complex patterns of variation. For example: the word \"table\" - \"e•həntáxpwi•nk\" is the original. The word is sometimes changed to e•həntáxpo•n which is the same word but it is reshaped as a derived noun.\n\nSome cases involve different words or \"highly divergent variants\" used as synonyms. For example, there are 4 ways to say \"eyelashes\" that are seen in the personal dialects.\n\nThere is no community norm, as the more widely used variants do not define a community norm for either the speakers or the linguist. Additionally, some variants cannot be rated as more and less popular or acceptable. \"Even a normative description would have to give both or all of them\".\n\nSome variation originates externally. Some usages can be traced directly to the Northern Unami language that was earlier spoken by some members of the Munsee community.\n\nSome variation originates internally. These pronunciations and grammatical tendencies are likely to have emerged in the not too distant past.\n\nMunsee is an Eastern Algonquian language. The hypothetical common ancestor language from which the Eastern Algonquian languages descend is Proto-Eastern Algonquian (PEA). An intermediate group \"Delawaran\" that is a descendant of Proto-Eastern Algonquian consists of Mahican and Common Delaware, the latter being a further subgroup comprising Munsee Delaware and Unami Delaware. The justification for Delawaran as an intermediate subgroup rests upon the high degree of similarity between Mahican and the two Delaware languages, but relatively little detailed argumentation in support of Delaware has been adduced.\n\nMunsee is demonstrably phonologically conservative, and is considered to have retained many of the phonological characteristics of PEA. In comparison, Unami has undergone extensive phonological innovation, coupled with morphological regularization.\n\nThe PEA vowel system consisted of four long vowels \"*i·, *o·, *e·, *a·,\" and two short vowels \"*a\" and \"ə.\" The vowel history is as follows: \"*i·\" (from PEA merger of Proto-Algonquian (PA \"*i·\" and \"*i\" to PEA \"*i·\"), \"*o·\" (from PEA merger of PA \"*o·\" and \"*o\" ), \"*e·\" (from Proto-Algonquian \"*e·\"), and \"*a·\" (from Proto-Algonquian \"*a·\"; the short vowels are\"*ə\" (from Proto-Algonquian \"*e\"), and \"*a\" (from Proto-Algonquian \"*a\"). This system was continued down to Common Delaware, but Munsee and Unami have innovated separately with respect to the vowel systems.\n\nContrastive vowel length for Munsee high vowels has been reintroduced, and also for the front mid-vowels. For modern Munsee it is necessary to recognize long /i·, o·, e·, a·/ and short /i, o, e, a/. Innovating instances of short /i, o, and e/ arise from for example reduplicating syllables and loan words.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "381564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=381564", "title": "Normative", "text": "Normative\n\nNormative generally means relating to an evaluative standard. Normativity is the phenomenon in human societies of designating some actions or outcomes as good or desirable or permissible and others as bad or undesirable or impermissible. A norm in this normative sense means a standard for evaluating or making judgments about behavior or outcomes. Normative is sometimes also used, somewhat confusingly, to mean relating to a descriptive standard: doing what is normally done or what most others are expected to do in practice. In this sense a norm is not evaluative, a basis for judging behavior or outcomes; it is simply a fact or observation about behavior or outcomes, without judgment. Many researchers in this field try to restrict the use of the term normative to the evaluative sense and refer to the description of behavior and outcomes as positive, descriptive, predictive, or empirical. \n\n\"Normative\" has specialized meanings in different academic disciplines such as philosophy, social sciences, and law. In most contexts, normative means 'relating to an evaluation or value judgment.' Normative propositions tend to evaluate some object or some course of action. Normative content differs from descriptive content.\n\nOne of the major developments in analytic philosophy has seen the reach of normativity spread to virtually all corners of the field, from ethics and the philosophy of action, to epistemology, metaphysics, and the philosophy of science. Saul Kripke famously showed that rules (including mathematical rules, such as the repetition of a decimal pattern) are normative in an important respect.\n\nThough philosophers disagree about how normativity should be understood, it has become increasingly common to understand normative claims as claims about reasons. As Derek Parfit explains:\n\nIn philosophy, \"normative\" statements make claims about how things should or ought to be, how to value them, which things are good or bad, and which actions are right or wrong. Normative claims are usually contrasted with positive (i.e. descriptive, explanatory, or constative) claims when describing types of theories, beliefs, or propositions. Positive statements are (purportedly) factual statements that attempt to describe reality.\n\nFor example, \"children should eat vegetables\", and \"those who would sacrifice liberty for security deserve neither\" are normative claims. On the other hand, \"vegetables contain a relatively high proportion of vitamins\", and \"a common consequence of sacrificing liberty for security is a loss of both\" are positive claims. Whether a statement is normative is logically independent of whether it is verified, verifiable, or popularly held.\n\nThere are several schools of thought regarding the status of normative statements and whether they can be rationally discussed or defended. Among these schools are the tradition of practical reason extending from Aristotle through Kant to Habermas, which asserts that they can, and the tradition of emotivism, which maintains that they are merely expressions of emotions and have no cognitive content. \n\nNormative statements and norms, as well as their meanings, are an integral part of human life. They are fundamental for prioritizing goals and organizing and planning. Thought, belief, emotion, and action are the basis of much ethical and political discourse; indeed, normativity is arguably the key feature distinguishing ethical and political discourse from other discourses (such as natural science).\n\nMuch modern moral/ethical philosophy takes as its starting point the apparent variance between peoples and cultures regarding the ways they define what is considered to be appropriate/desirable/praiseworthy/valuable/good etc. (In other words, variance in how individuals, groups and societies define what is in accordance with their normative standards.) This has led philosophers such as A.J. Ayer and J.L. Mackie (for different reasons and in different ways) to cast doubt on the meaningfulness of normative statements. However, other philosophers, such as Christine Korsgaard, have argued for a source of normative value which is independent of individuals' subjective morality and which consequently attains (a lesser or greater degree of) objectivity.\n\nIn the social sciences, the term \"normative\" has broadly the same meaning as its usage in philosophy, but may also relate, in a sociological context, to the role of cultural 'norms'; the shared values or institutions that structural functionalists regard as constitutive of the social structure and social cohesion. These values and units of socialization thus act to encourage or enforce social activity and outcomes that \"ought\" to (with respect to the norms implicit in those structures) occur, while discouraging or preventing social activity that \"ought not\" occur. That is, they promote social activity that is socially \"valued\" (see philosophy above). While there are always anomalies in social activity (typically described as \"crime\" or anti-social behaviour, see also normality (behavior)) the normative effects of popularly endorsed beliefs (such as \"family values\" or \"common sense\") push most social activity towards a generally homogeneous set. From such reasoning, however, functionalism shares an affinity with ideological conservatism.\n\nNormative economics deals with questions of what sort of economic policies should be pursued, in order to achieve desired (that is, valued) economic outcomes.\n\nIn the academic discipline of International relations, Smith, Baylis & Owens in the \"Introduction\" to their 2008 book make the case that the normative position or normative theory is to make the world a better place and that this theoretical worldview aims to do so by being aware of implicit assumptions and explicit assumptions that constitute a non-normative position, and align or position the normative towards the loci of other key socio-political theories such as political Liberalism, Marxism, political Constructivism, political Realism, political Idealism and political Globalization.\n\nIn law, as an academic discipline, the term \"normative\" is used to describe the way something ought to be done according to a value position. As such, normative arguments can be conflicting, insofar as different values can be inconsistent with one another. For example, from one normative value position the purpose of the criminal process may be to repress crime. From another value position, the purpose of the criminal justice system could be to protect individuals from the moral harm of wrongful conviction.\n\nNormative elements are defined in International Organization for Standardization Directives Part 2 as \"elements that describe the scope of the document, and which set out provisions\". Provisions include \"requirements\", \"recommendations\" and \"statements\". \"Statements\" include permissions, possibilities and capabilities. A \"requirement\" is an \"expression in the content of a document conveying criteria to be fulfilled if compliance with the document is to be claimed and from which no deviation is permitted.\" It is not necessary to comply with recommendations and statements in order to comply with the standard; it is necessary to comply only with the requirements (that are denoted by the verbal form \"shall\"). There is much confusion between \"normative\" and \"requirement\", however the ISO terminology is supported by national standards bodies worldwide and is the legitimate description of these terms in the context of standards documents.\n\nIn standards terminology still used by some organisations, \"normative\" means \"considered to be a prescriptive part of the standard\". It characterises that part of the standard which describes what \"ought\" (see philosophy above) to be done within the application of that standard. It is implicit that application of that standard will result in a \"valuable\" outcome (\"ibid.\"). For example, many standards have an introduction, preface, or summary that is considered non-normative, as well as a main body that is considered normative. \"Compliance\" is defined as \"complies with the normative sections of the standard\"; an object that complies with the normative sections but not the non-normative sections of a standard is still considered to be in compliance.\n\n\nTypically, \"normative\" is contrasted with \"informative\" (referring to the standard's descriptive, explanatory or positive content). Informative data is supplemental information such as additional guidance, supplemental recommendations, tutorials, commentary as well as background, history, development, and relationship with other elements. Informative data is not a requirement and doesn’t compel compliance.\n\n"}

The first known Paleo-Eskimo cultures developed by 2500 BCE, but were gradually displaced in most of the region, with the last one, the Dorset culture, disappearing around 1500 CE.\n\nPaleo-Eskimo groups included the Pre-Dorset; the Saqqaq culture of Greenland (2500 – 800 BCE); the Independence I and Independence II cultures of northeastern Canada and Greenland (c. 2400 – 1800 BCE and c. 800 – 1 BCE); the Groswater of Labrador and Nunavik, and the Dorset culture (500 BCE to 1500 CE), which spread across Arctic North America. The Dorset were the last major Paleo-Eskimo culture in the Arctic before the migration east from present-day Alaska of the Thule, the ancestors of the modern Inuit.\n\nIn February 2010, scientists reported they had performed the first genome sequencing of an ancient human. Using fragments of hair 4,000 years old, the National Museum of Denmark, the Beijing Genomics Institute, and additional collaborating scientific institutions sequenced nearly 80% of a Paleo-Eskimo man's genome. The man was found in Greenland and believed to be from the prehistoric Saqqaq culture.\n\nBased on the genome, the scientists believe there was a distinct, separate migration of peoples from Siberia to North America some 5,500 years ago. They noted that this was independent of earlier migrations, whose descendants comprised the historic cultures of the indigenous peoples of the Americas, as well as of the later migration by the Inuit. By 4,500 years ago, descendants of this migration had reached Greenland. The remains used for analysis were found in a Saqqaq culture area.\n\nThe scientists reported that the man, dubbed \"Inuk\" (the Inuktitut word for \"person\"), had A+ blood type and genes suggesting he was adapted to cold weather, had brown eyes, brownish skin, and dark hair, and would have likely balded later in life. This marked the first sequencing of an ancient human's genome and the first sequencing of an ancient human's mitochondrial genome.\n\nA 2017 study identifies Paleo-Eskimo ancestry in Athabaskans, as well as in other Na-Dene-speaking populations. The authors note that the Paleo-Eskimo peoples lived alongside Na-Dene ancestors for millennia. Thus, there's new evidence of a genetic connection between Siberian and Na-Dene populations mediated by Paleo-Eskimos.\n\nAccording to these scholars, in general, the Paleo-Eskimos had large proportions of Beringian (which includes Chukotko-Kamchatkan and Eskimo-Aleut), Siberian, and South-East Asian ancestry. According to some scholars, they may also be related to the later Old Bering Sea archaeological culture.\n\n"}

Hence the patriots played down the leading role of the sovereign. They\nquestioned the royal prerogative, seeing the king as the mere figurehead of England. The king's absolute authority was challenged by the authority of Parliament.\n\nAgainst this increasing opposition, the Patriarchalists emphasized the absolute right of the king, as the paternal head of state. In \"Patriarcha\" (composed in the late 1620s), Sir Robert Filmer said \"many out of an imaginary fear\npretend the power of the people to be necessary for the repressing of the insolencies of tyrants, herein they propound a remedy far worse than the disease\"\n\nFilmer used genealogy as a way to legitimize kingship, by tracing the throne's origins back to the original fatherly rule of Adam.\n\nFilmer argued that the king \"is\" the father; the relationship is not one of similarity, but of identity, the right of fathers having been passed down genealogically since Adam.\n\nStating that the ideal relationship was between a father and his son to indicate the \"mutuall trust and Confidence\" which was always necessary in the State, Kynaston put forward the view that the inferior (the people) ought not to plot against the superior (the king).\n\nRichard Mocket maintained that the maxim “Honor thy Father, and thy Mother” pertained to the political sphere rather than to the familial one since it had more to do with political obedience than with submission within the household\n\nLocke and Montesquieu were instrumental in the rejection of Patriarchalism.\n"}

It is based in Bloomsbury, London, United Kingdom. The SOAS School of Law is the sole law school in the world dedicated to the study of legal systems in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nThe School of Law has over 400 students. It offers programmes at the LL.B., LL.M. and MPhil/PhD level. International students have been the majority at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level for many years.\n\nIt publishes a number of journals, including the Journal of African Law, the Journal of Comparative Law and the Yearbook of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law. Along with the International Environmental Law Research Centre (IELRC), it produces the Law, Environment and Development Journal (LEAD Journal). An independent student law journal is also published by undergraduate and graduate students, the SOAS Law Journal, and includes unique scholarship from faculty, students and alumni.\n\nNotable alumni of the school of law include David Lammy MP, former President of Ghana John Atta Mills, Supreme Court justices from Nigeria and Sri Lanka, and Iranian human rights activist Ghoncheh Ghavami. \nThe SOAS School of Law was established in 1947 with Vesey-Fitzgerald as its first head, and as such is one of the 20 oldest law schools in England. Initially, the School of Law only hosted post-graduate students. In 1975, under the leadership of Antony Nicholas Allott, the school developed a uniquely comparative undergraduate LL.B. Honours programme that thrives to this day. In 2012, the Head of the Law School, Mashood Baderin, was appointed as Special Independent Expert to Sudan by the United Nations Human Rights Council. In 2013, Paul Kohler assumed the role as Head of the SOAS School of Law following the retirement of Baderin.\n\nThe SOAS School of Law Honours Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) programme is recognised as a Qualifying Law Degree by the Law Society of England and Wales and the Bar Council for the purposes of completing legal training. As such, the SOAS LL.B. satisfies all professional requirements for the Common Professional Examination. Admission is highly competitive with fewer than 80 available spaces each academic year.\n\nAlthough many modules at SOAS embody a substantial element of English common law, all modules are taught as far as possible in a comparative or international manner with an emphasis in the way in which law functions in society. Thus, law studies at SOAS are broad and comparative in their orientation. All students study a significant amount of non-English law, start in the first year of the LL.B. course, where 'Legal Systems of Asia and Africa' is compulsory. Specialised modules in the laws and legal systems of particular countries and regions is also encouraged and faculty experts conduct modules in these subjects every year.\n\nSeveral combination BA degrees also allow students to combine law courses with another faculty, including history and politics. The SOAS School of Law also has a Master of Laws (LL.M.) which provides many advanced courses on comparative, international and transnational commercial law- all focused on Asian and African legal issues. The SOAS School of Law also offers a PhD programme.\n\nIn addition to academic programmes, SOAS School of Law students also have access to several Pro Bono law clinics. These Pro Bono law clinics offer students the opportunity to work alongside practising lawyers on actual cases involving human rights and civil rights which are taken on free of charge to the clients.\n\nThe SOAS School of Law has expertise in the laws of Asian and African countries, human rights, transnational commercial law, environmental law, and comparative law.\n\nIt is home to the following research centres:\n\nFaculty members routinely contribute to journals and publish volumes of leading research annually. The school has close ties with the internationally renowned Institute of Advanced Legal Studies, which is also part of the federal University of London.\n\nThe SOAS School of Law and faculty members are involved in the publication of the following legal research journals: \n\nThe SOAS School of Law was ranked 25th out of all British law schools by \"The Guardian\" League Table in 2018.\nThe QS World University Rankings placed SOAS in the 101-150 bracket in 2018. However, it should be noted that due to the highly specialised orientation and academic niche that the SOAS School of Law serves, a true comparison to other generalist institutions is impossible.\n\nThe SOAS Law Society promotes opportunities to learn about the study of law and career options to student members at SOAS. The Law Society hosts meetings, intercollegiate exchanges, mooting tournaments and other educational events. Although there was formerly a separate SOAS Bar Society that conducted bar-related programming and organised moot teams and tournaments, it merged with the Law Society in 2013. Past moot teams fielded by the SOAS Law Society or SOAS Bar Society have participated in the annual English Law Students Association (ELSA) Moot Tournament and the prestigious London Universities Mooting Shield, which was founded by SOAS Law School alumnus, barrister and present New York attorney Daniel Jackson.\nFaculty at the SOAS School of Law are routinely rated highly on national student satisfaction surveys, with the satisfaction rate reaching 91% in 2015.\n\nThe SOAS School of Law has more than 30 full-time academic staff, 20 professors, many visiting professors and distinguished judicial and other visiting academic staff. \n\nVisiting Professors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Riza was one of the founding members of the Albanological Institute of Pristina in 1953.\n\nSelman Riza was born in Yakova (now Gjakova), Ottoman Empire on 21 December 1909. In 1922 he migrated to Albania, where he first studied in the \"Naim Frashëri\" school. At the time of his graduation in 1925 he was honored as the best student of the school and gained a scholarship in the National Lyceum of Korçë in 1925. As Riza graduated three years earlier than the regular duration of the studies the lyceum's director Leon Perre suggested him for the annual scholarship of the ministry of education. In 1931 he gained a scholarship in the University of Toulouse, where in three years he graduated from both the faculties of French language and literature and that of law. Later he studied in the University of Heidelberg, where he graduated from the faculty of German language. After returning to Albania he joined the faculty of the National Lyceum of Korçë.\n\nAfter the Italian invasion of Albania protests were held in many parts of Albania. Selman Riza was arrested by the Italian authorities in the protest of Korçë held in the national day of Albania, on 28 November 1939. The documents of the town's fascist militia describe him as an anti-Italian activist, who disseminated antifascist material among his students. In 1940 Riza was arrested again and transferred to the Santo Stefano internment camp. In October 1941 he was released and moved to Durrës and in July 1942 to Kosovo, where he founded the \"Irredentist Antifascist Movement\", an anti-nazi and anticommunist organization. The manifesto of the organization was published in Tiranë in December 1943. In 1945 he returned to the city, but was arrested one day later by the Communist regime. Yugoslav authorities asked for his extradition, which was initially accepted but later the decision was overturned after the intervention of the minister of justice Manol Konomi. In 1948 a new extradition request was accepted and he was moved to Yugoslav prisons. Riza was released in 1951, because he was heavily afflicted by scurvy.\n\nAfter his release he co-founded the Albanological Institute of Pristina along with Ilhami Nimani, Mehdi Bardhi, and Ali Rexha. In 1955 he returned to Albania and worked at the Institute of Linguistics and Literature in Tirana and the faculty of philology of the University of Tirana. In April 1967 he was again put to trial and as a result his writing and publishing rights were revoked. After being transferred to Berat his right to borrow books from the library was revoked too. Selman Riza died in 1988, while most of his works were published post-mortem. In 2005 Ibrahim Rugova, President of Kosovo, posthumously awarded him with the Golden Medal of the League of Prizren and in 2009 Fatmir Sejdiu, his successor awarded Riza with the Golden Medal of Freedom.\n\nIn 1944 his commentary work on Albanological studies, titled \"Tri Monografina Albanologjike\", was published in Tiranë. His works' main subjects include variants of the Albanian language used in early Albanian literature, especially with Gjon Buzuku's \"Meshari\". His 1952 study on the Serbo-Croatian grammar is regarded as a work of contrastive analysis, although that theory was not formulated until five years later by Robert Lado.\n"}

{"id": "27707", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27707", "title": "Socialist law", "text": "Socialist law\n\nSocialist law or Soviet law denotes a general type of legal system which has been used in socialist and formerly socialist states. It is based on the civil law system, with major modifications and additions from Marxist-Leninist ideology. There is controversy as to whether socialist law ever constituted a separate legal system or not. If so, prior to the end of the Cold War, \"socialist law\" would be ranked among the major legal systems of the world.\n\nWhile civil law systems have traditionally put great pains in defining the notion of private property, how it may be acquired, transferred, or lost, socialist law systems provide for most property to be owned by the state or by agricultural co-operatives, and having special courts and laws for state enterprises.\n\nMany scholars argue that socialist law was not a separate legal classification. Although the command economy approach of the communist states meant that most types of property could not be owned, the Soviet Union always had a civil code, courts that interpreted this civil code, and a civil law approach to legal reasoning (thus, both legal process and legal reasoning were largely analogous to the French or German civil code system). Legal systems in all socialist states preserved formal criteria of the Romano-Germanic civil law; for this reason, law theorists in post-socialist states usually consider the socialist law as a particular case of the Romano-Germanic civil law. Cases of development of common law into socialist law are unknown because of incompatibility of basic principles of these two systems (common law presumes influential rule-making role of courts while courts in socialist states play a dependent role).\n\nSoviet law displayed many special characteristics that derived from the socialist nature of the Soviet state and reflected Marxist-Leninist ideology. Vladimir Lenin accepted the Marxist conception of the law and the state as instruments of coercion in the hands of the bourgeoisie and postulated the creation of popular, informal tribunals to administer revolutionary justice. One of the main theoreticians of Soviet socialist legality in this early phase was Pēteris Stučka.\n\nAlongside this utopian trend was one more critical of the concept of \"proletarian justice\", represented by Evgeny Pashukanis. A dictatorial trend developed that advocated the use of law and legal institutions to suppress all opposition to the regime. This trend reached its zenith under Joseph Stalin with the ascendancy of Andrey Vyshinsky, when the administration of justice was carried out mainly by the security police in special tribunals.\n\nDuring the de-Stalinization of the Nikita Khrushchev era, a new trend developed, based on socialist legality, that stressed the need to protect the procedural and statutory rights of citizens, while still calling for obedience to the state. New legal codes, introduced in 1960, were part of the effort to establish legal norms in administering laws. Although socialist legality remained in force after 1960, the dictatorial and utopian trends continued to influence the legal process. Persecution of political and religious dissenters continued, but at the same time there was a tendency to decriminalize lesser offenses by handing them over to people's courts and administrative agencies and dealing with them by education rather than by incarceration.\nBy late 1986, the Mikhail Gorbachev era was stressing anew the importance of individual rights in relation to the state and criticizing those who violated procedural law in implementing Soviet justice. This signaled a resurgence of socialist legality as the dominant trend. Socialist legality itself still lacked features associated with Western jurisprudence.\n\nSocialist law is similar to common law or civil law but with a greatly increased public law sector and decreased private law sector.\n\n\nA specific institution characteristic to Socialist law was the so-called burlaw court (or, verbally, \"court of comrades\", Russian товарищеский суд) which decided on minor offences.\n\nAmong the remaining communist governments, some (most notably the People's Republic of China) have added extensive modifications to their legal systems. In general, this is a result of their market-oriented economic changes. However, some communist influence can still be seen. For example, in Chinese real estate law there is no unified concept of real property; the state owns all land but often not the structures that sit on that land. A rather complex \"ad hoc\" system of use rights to land property has developed, and these use rights are the things being officially traded (rather than the property itself). In some cases (for example in the case of urban residential property), the system results in something that resembles real property transactions in other legal systems.\n\nIn other cases, the Chinese system results in something quite different. For example, it is a common misconception that reforms under Deng Xiaoping resulted in the privatization of agricultural land and a creation of a land tenure system similar to those found in Western countries. In actuality, the village committee owns the land and contracts the right to use this land to individual farmers who may use the land to make money from agriculture. Hence the rights that are normally unified in Western economies are split up between the individual farmer and the village committee.\n\nThis has a number of consequences. One of them is that, because the farmer does not have an absolute right to transfer the land, he cannot borrow against his use rights. On the other hand, there is some insurance against risk in the system, in that the farmer can return his land to the village committee if he wants to stop farming and start some other sort of business. Then, if this business does not work, he can get a new contract with the village committee and return to farming. The fact that the land is redistributable by the village committee also ensures that no one is left landless; this creates a form of social welfare.\n\nThere have been a number of proposals to reform this system and they have tended to be in the direction of fully privatizing rural land for the alleged purpose of increasing efficiency. These proposals have usually not received any significant support, largely because of the popularity of the current system among the farmers themselves. There is little risk that the village committee will attempt to impose a bad contract on the farmers, since this would reduce the amount of money the village committee receives. At the same time, the farmer has some flexibility to decide to leave farming for other ventures and to return at a later time.\n\n"}
