In computer science, the Lilian date is the number of days since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar on 15 October 1582.\n\nNot much is known about the early life of Lilius/Lilio/Giglio. It is known that he came from Calabria, Italy, from Ciro. He studied medicine and astronomy in Naples, after which he served Earl Carafa. He settled in Verona and died in 1576. Although he was still alive at the time when his proposal was presented at Rome, it does not seem that he made the presentation; it was handled by his brother Antonio, also a physician and astronomer.\n\nHe is primarily known as the \"first author\" of the Gregorian Calendar: he wrote the proposal on which (after modifications) the calendar reform was based. Lilio's brother Antonio presented the manuscript to Pope Gregory XIII; it was passed to the calendar reform commission in 1575. The commission issued a printed summary entitled \"Compendium novae rationis restituendi kalendarium\" (Compendium of a New Plan for the Restitution of the Calendar), printed in 1577 and circulated within the Roman Catholic world in early 1578 as a consultation document. Lilio's manuscript itself is not known to have survived; the printed 'Compendium' is the nearest known source for the details it contained.\n\nThe processes of consultation and deliberation meant that the reform to the calendar did not occur until 1582, six years after the death of Luigi Lilio in 1576. The reform had by then received some modifications in points of detail by the reform commission, in which one of the leading members was Christopher Clavius, who afterwards wrote defences and an explanation of the reformed calendar, including an emphatic acknowledgement of Lilio's work, especially for his provision of a useful reform for the lunar cycle: \"We owe much gratitude and praise to Luigi Giglio who contrived such an ingenious Cycle of Epacts which, inserted in the calendar, always shows the new moon and so can be easily adapted to any length of the year, if only at the right moments the due adjustment is applied.\" The papal bull (\"Inter gravissimas\") was issued on 24 February 1582 (year 1581 of the old Julian calendar), ordering Catholic clergy to adopt the new calendar, and exhorting all Catholic sovereigns to do the same.\n\nThe year 2010 was the 500th year since the Lilius' birth; several activities were organized by Italian astronomers in order to recognize the great work performed by him. In particular, in Torretta di Crucoli (Crotone, Italy), a new astronomical group was created and dedicated to Luigi Lilio: Circolo Astrofili Luigi Lilio Torretta (C.A.L.L.T.).\n\n\n\n"}

He has been a prolific historical novelist since then having published more than 50 novels.\n\nCornwell's best known books feature the adventures of Richard Sharpe, a British soldier during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe first 11 books of the Sharpe series (beginning in chronological order with \"Sharpe's Rifles\" and ending with \"Sharpe's Waterloo\", published in the US as \"Waterloo\") detail Sharpe's adventures in various Peninsular War campaigns over the course of 6–7 years. Subsequently, Cornwell wrote a prequel quintet – \"Sharpe's Tiger\", \"Sharpe's Triumph\", \"Sharpe's Fortress\", \"Sharpe's Trafalgar\" and \"Sharpe's Prey\" – depicting Sharpe's adventures under Wellington's command in India, including his hard-won promotion to the officer corps, his return to Britain and his arrival in the 95th Rifles, and a sequel, \"Sharpe's Devil\", set six years after the end of the wars.\n\nHe also wrote \"Sharpe's Battle\", a novel \"inserted\" into his previous continuity, taking place during the Battle of Fuentes de Oñoro. It has been asserted [unattributed] that Cornwell was initially dubious about the casting of Sean Bean for the television adaptations. However, Cornwell effectively scotches this assertion in an interview with the \"CompleatSeanBean\" website. Indeed, Cornwell states in the same interview that \"..I was utterly delighted that it was to be Sean Bean..\" Cornwell also dedicated \"Sharpe's Battle\" to Sean Bean, and has admitted that he subtly changed the writing of the character to align with Bean's portrayal. Since 2003, he has written further \"missing adventures\" set during the \"classic\" Peninsular War era.\n\nThe following is the correct 'historical' order, although they are all stand alone stories:\n\nA tetralogy set during the American Civil War. The title character, Nathaniel Starbuck, is a Northerner who has decided to fight for the South in a Virginian regiment, the Faulconer Legion. The last novel to date in the series has been \"The Bloody Ground\", taking place during the Antietam Campaign. Cornwell has said that he plans to write more Starbuck novels, but has not done so yet. On his website Cornwell has recently stated that he is 'thinking' about Starbuck again.\n\nA trilogy depicting Cornwell's historical re-creation of Arthurian Britain. The series posits that Post-Roman Britain was a difficult time for the native Britons, being threatened by invasion from the Anglo-Saxons in the East and raids from the Irish in the West. At the same time, they suffered internal power struggles between their petty kingdoms and friction between the old Druidic religion and newly arrived Christianity.\n\nA series that deals with a mid-14th century search for the Holy Grail during the Hundred Years' War. An English archer, Thomas of Hookton, becomes drawn into the quest by the actions of a mercenary soldier called \"The Harlequin,\" who murders Thomas's family in his own obsessive search for the Grail. Cornwell was planning at one point to write more books about the main character Thomas of Hookton and said that shortly after finishing \"Heretic\" he had \"... started another Thomas of Hookton book, then stopped it – mainly because I felt that his story ended in \"Heretic\" and I was just trying to get too much from him. Which doesn't mean I won't pick the idea up again sometime in the future.\"\n\nCornwell's latest series focuses on the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex, England during the 9th-century reign of Alfred the Great, his fierce opposition to the Danes and his determination to unite England as one country. The series, as of 2018, has eleven books.\n\nCornwell's thrillers are modern mysteries, all with sailing themes. He is a traditional sailor and enjoys sailing his Cornish Crabber by the name of \"Royalist\". His thorough knowledge of sailing and popular skills with writing combine in great novels for the nautically obsessed. According to Cornwell's website, there may be no additions to the series: \"I enjoyed writing the thrillers, but suspect I am happier writing historical novels. I'm always delighted when people want more of the sailing books, but I'm not planning on writing any more, at least not now – but who knows? perhaps when I retire.\"\n\nCornwell published a nonfiction book, \"\", released in September 2014, timely for the 200th anniversary of that battle.\n\n\"Waterloo: The History of Four Days, Three Armies and Three Battles\" September 2014 / 9780007539383 (UK edition) Publisher William Collins\n"}
{"id": "517916", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517916", "title": "Circassians", "text": "Circassians\n\nThe Circassians ( \"Čerkesy\"), also known by their endonym Adyghe (Circassian: Адыгэхэр \"Adygekher\", \"Adýgi\"), are a Northwest Caucasian nation native to Circassia, many of whom were displaced in the course of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus in the 19th century, especially after the Russo-Circassian War in 1864. In its narrowest sense, the term \"Circassian\" includes the twelve Adyghe (Circassian: Адыгэ, \"Adyge\") princedoms (three democratic and nine aristocratic); Abdzakh, Besleney, Bzhedug, Hatuqwai, Kabardian, Mamkhegh, Natukhai, Shapsug, Temirgoy, Ubykh, Yegeruqwai and Zhaney, each star on the Circassian flag representing each princedom. However, due to Soviet administrative divisions, Circassians were also designated as the following: \"Adygeans\" (Adyghe in Adygea), \"Cherkessians\" (Adyghe in Karachay-Cherkessia), \"Kabardians\" (Adyghe in Kabardino-Balkaria) and \"Shapsugians\" (Adyghe in Krasnodar Krai), although all the four are essentially the same people residing in different political units.\n\nMost Circassians are Sunni Muslim. The Circassians mainly speak the Circassian languages, a Northwest Caucasian dialect continuum with three main dialects and numerous sub-dialects. Many Circassians also speak Turkish, Russian, English, Arabic and Hebrew, having been exiled by Russia to lands of the Ottoman Empire, where the majority of them today live. About 800,000 Circassians remain in historical Circassia (the modern-day titular Circassian republics of Adygea, Kabardino-Balkaria and Karachay-Cherkessia as well as Krasnodar Krai and the southwestern parts of Stavropol Krai and Rostov Oblast), and others live in the Russian Federation outside these republics and krais. The 2010 Russian Census recorded 718,727 Circassians, of whom 516,826 are Kabardian, 124,835 are other Adyghe in Adygea, 73,184 are Cherkess and 3,882 Shapsug.\n\nThe Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization estimated in the early 1990s that there are as many as 3.7 million \"ethnic Circassian\" diaspora (in over 50 countries) outside the titular Circassian republics (meaning that only one in seven \"ethnic Circassians\" live in the homeland), and that, of these 3.7 million, more than 2 million live in Turkey, 300,000 in the Levant (mostly modern-day Jordan and Syria) and Mesopotamia and 50,000 in Western Europe and the United States.\n\nThe Circassians refer to themselves as \"Adyghe\" (also transliterated as \"Adyga\", \"Adyge\", \"Adygei\", \"Adyghe\", \"Attéghéi\"). The name is believed to derive from \"atté\" \"height\" to signify a mountaineer or a highlander, and \"ghéi\" \"sea\", signifying \"a people dwelling and inhabiting a mountainous country near the sea coast\", or \"between two seas\".\n\nThe exonym \"Circassians\" ( ) is occasionally applied to Adyghe and Abaza from the North Caucasus. The name \"Circassian\" represents a Latinisation of \"Siraces\", the Greek name for the region, called \"Shirkess\" by Khazars and later \"Cherkess\", the Turkic name for the Adyghe, and originated in the 15th century with medieval Genoese merchants and travellers to Circassia.\n\nThe Turkic peoples and Russians call the Adyghe \"Cherkess\". Folk etymology usually explains the name \"Cherkess\" as \"warrior cutter\" or \"soldier cutter\", from the Turkish words \"çeri\" (soldier) and \"kesmek\" (to cut).\n\nDespite a common self-designation and a common Russian name, Soviet authorities applied four designations to Circassians:\n\nIn Russian historiography the term had been used as an exonym for Russian, Ukrainian and Cossack people at least until the end of the 18th century, and Caucasian Tatar peoples (namely Terek Tatar and Kumyk).\n\nIn Turkey the term nowadays used as a name for all Caucasian nations such as, such as Karachays, Ossetians, different Dagestanian diasporas and others.\n\nGenetically, the Adyghe have shared ancestry partially with neighboring peoples of the Caucasus, with some influence from the other regions. The Circassian language, also known as the Cherkess language, including West Adyghe, Kabardian Adyghe, and Ubykh, is a member of the ancient Northwest Caucasian language family.\n\nArchaeological findings, mainly of dolmens in Northwest Caucasus region, indicate a megalithic culture in the Northwest Caucasus. Around the beginning of the 4th millennium BC, the North West Caucasus region and western Steppes became influenced by the Maykop culture.\n\nAs a result of Greek and Byzantine influence, Christianity spread throughout the Caucasus between the 3rd and 5th centuries AD. During that period the Circassians (referred to at the time as \"Kassogs\") began to accept Christianity as a national religion, but did not abandon all elements of their indigenous religious beliefs.\n\nFrom around 400 AD wave after wave of invaders began to invade the lands of the Adyghe people, who were also known as the \"Kasogi\" (or Kassogs) at the time. They were conquered first by the Bulgars (who originated on the Central Asian steppes). Outsiders sometimes confused the Adyghe people with the similarly-named Utigurs (a branch of the Bulgars), and both peoples were sometimes conflated under misnomers such as \"Utige\". Following the dissolution of the Khazar state, the Adyghe people were integrated around the end of the 1st millennium AD into the Kingdom of Alania.\n\nBetween the 10th and 13th centuries Georgia had influence on the Adyghe Circassian peoples, with many adopting Christianity.\n\nIn the 17th century, under the influence of the Crimean Tatars and of the Ottoman Empire, large numbers of Circassians converted to Islam from Christianity.\n\nIn 1708, , a Crimean khan, ordered to have 4,000 Kabardian slaves while ascending to the throne. Kabardians led by were reluctant to pay tribute to the Crimean Khan. Qaplan I Giray along with 20,000 warriors marched to Kabarday to retrieve his demands. While setting a fire camp, Crimean Tatars were attacked by 7,000 cavalry units headed by Prince Kurgoko Atazhukin in the near Malka River. The Crimean army was destroyed in one night on 17 September 1708. Only a small group of Crimeans headed by Qaplan I Giray managed to escape. In 2013, the Institute of Russian History of the Russian Academy of Sciences recognized that the battle of Kinzhal Mountain with the paramount importance in the national history of Kabardians, Balkarians and Ossetians.\n\nBetween the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries, the Adyghe people lost their independence as the Russian Empire gradually carried out a series of wars and campaigns. During this period, the Adyghe plight achieved a certain celebrity status in the West; but pledges of assistance were never fulfilled. After the Crimean War of 1853 to 1856, Russia turned its attention to the Caucasus in earnest. Following major territorial losses for Persia in the Caucasus in the aftermath of the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813) and the Russo-Persian War (1826–1828), forcing Persia to cede what comprises now Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan to Imperial Russia, Russia found itself able to focus most of its army on subduing the rebelling natives of the North Caucasus, starting with the peoples of Chechnya and Dagestan. In 1859 the Russians finished defeating Imam Shamil in the eastern Caucasus, and turned their attention westward. Eventually, the long-lasting Russian–Circassian War, which had begun in 1763, ended with the defeat of the Adyghe forces. Some Adyghe leaders signed loyalty oaths on 2 June 1864 (21 May, O.S.).\n\nThe conquest of the Caucasus by the Russian Empire in the 19th century during the Russian-Circassian War led to the destruction and killing of many Adyghe—towards the end of the conflict, the Russian General had the task of driving the remaining Circassian inhabitants out of the region, primarily into the Ottoman Empire. Mobile columns of Russian riflemen and Cossack cavalry carried out the task. \"In a series of sweeping military campaigns lasting from 1860 to 1864... the northwest Caucasus and the Black Sea coast were virtually emptied of Muslim villagers. Columns of the displaced were marched either to the Kuban [River] plains or toward the coast for transport to the Ottoman Empire... One after another, entire Circassian tribal groups were dispersed, resettled, or killed en masse\" This expulsion, along with the actions of the Russian military in acquiring Circassian land, has given rise to a movement among descendants of the expelled ethnicities for international recognition that genocide was perpetrated. In 1840 Karl Friedrich Neumann estimated the Circassian casualties at around one and a half million. Some sources state that hundreds of thousands of others died during the exodus. Several historians use the phrase \"Circassian massacres\" for the consequences of Russian actions in the region.\n\nOn 20 May 2011 the Georgian parliament voted in a 95 to 0 declaration that Russia had committed genocide when it engaged in massacres against Circassians in the 19th century.\nLike other ethnic minorities under Russian rule, the Adyghe who remained in the Russian Empire borders were subjected to policies of mass resettlement.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire, which ruled large parts of the area south of Russia, regarded the Adyghe warriors as courageous and well-experienced. It encouraged them to settle in various near-border settlements of the Ottoman Empire in order to strengthen the empire's borders.\n\nAccording to Walter Richmond,\n\n\"Circassia was a small independent nation on the northeastern shore of the Black Sea. For no reason other than ethnic hatred, over the course of hundreds of raids the Russians drove the Circassians from their homeland and deported them to the Ottoman Empire. At least 600,000 people lost their lives to massacre, starvation, and the elements while hundreds of thousands more were forced to leave their homeland. By 1864, three-fourths of the population was annihilated, and the Circassians had become one of the first stateless peoples in modern history\".\nIt has been estimated that the Ottoman Empire imported some 200,000 slaves—mainly Circassians—between 1800 and 1909. The Adyghes who were settled by the Ottomans in various near-border settlements across the empire, ended up living across many territories in the Middle East. At the time these belonged to the Ottoman Empire and are now located in the following countries:\n\n\nAdyghe society prior to the Russian invasion was highly stratified. While a few princedoms in the mountainous regions of Adygeya were fairly egalitarian, most were broken into strict castes. The highest was the caste of the \"princes\", followed by a caste of lesser nobility, and then commoners, serfs, and slaves. In the decades before Russian rule, two princedoms overthrew their traditional rulers and set up democratic processes, but this social experiment was cut short by the end of Adyghe independence.\n\nCircassians mainly speak the Circassian language, a Northwest Caucasian language with numerous dialects, the primary ones being Adyghe (West Circassian) and Kabardian (East Adyghe). West Adyghe language is based on Temirgoy dialect, while East Adyghe language is based on Kabardian dialect. Circassians also speak Russian, Turkish, English, Arabic, and Hebrew in large numbers, having been exiled by Russia to lands of the Ottoman Empire, where the majority of them live today, and some to neighboring Persia, to which they came primarily through mass deportations by the Safavids and Qajars or, to a lesser extent, as muhajirs in the 19th century.\n\nWalter Richmond writes that the Circassian language in Russia is \"gravely threatened.\" He argues that Russian policy of surrounding small Circassian communities with Slavic populations has created conditions where Circassian language and nationality will disappear. By the 1990s, Russian had become the standard language for business in the Republic of Adygea, even within communities with Circassian majority populations.\n\nAncestors of modern Adyghe people gradually went through following various religions: Monotheism with its Christianity, and then Islam.\n\nIt is the tradition of the early church that Christianity made its first appearance in Circassia in the first century AD via the travels and preaching of the Apostle Andrew. Subsequently, Christianity spread throughout the Caucasus between the 4th century and the 6th century.\n\nA small Muslim presence in Circassia has existed since the Middle Ages, but widespread Islamization occurred after 1717, when Sultan Murad IV ordered the Crimean Khans to spread Islam among the Circassians, with the Ottomans and Crimeans seeing some success in converting members of the aristocracy who would then ultimately spread the religion to their dependents. However, despite the efforts of the Ottomans and their Crimean and Circassian clients, the masses of the Circassian people remained Christian and pagan, until the threat of Russian conquest impelled the majority of them to convert in order to cement defensive alliances with the Ottoman Empire and the Crimean Khanate to protect their independence; significant Christian and pagan presence remained among some tribes such as the Shapsugs and Natukhai with Islamization pressures implemented by those loyal to the Caucasus Emirate. Sufi orders including the Qadiri and Nakshbandi orders gained prominence and played a role in spreading Islam.\n\nToday, a large majority of Circassians remain Muslim, with minorities of atheists and Christians. Atheist Circassians tend to be of the younger generation (20–35 years old), in which they were found to constitute a quarter of Circassians in Kabardino-Balkaria. Among Christians, Catholicism, originally introduced along the coasts by Venetian and Genoese traders, today constitutes just under 1% of Kabardins. Some Circassians are also Orthodox Christian, notably including those in Mozdok and some of those Kursky district. Among Muslims, Islamic observance varies widely between those who only know a few prayers with a Muslim identity that is more \"cultural\" than religious, to those who regularly observe all requirements. Both Islam and the Habze are identified as national characteristics even by those that do not practice. Today, Islam is a central part of life in many Circassian diaspora communities, such as in Israel, while in the Circassian homeland Soviet rule saw an extensive process of secularization, and there is wide influence of many social norms which contradict Islamic law, such as widespread observance of traditional pre-Islamic moral codes contradicting those of Islam, and norms like social alcohol consumption; in Israel, meanwhile, such non-Islamic social norms are not present.\n\nIn the modern times, it has been reported that those who identify primarily as adherents of the native Habze faith (as opposed to another listed faith) constitute 12% of the population of Karachay-Cherkessia and 3% of the population of Kabardino-Balkaria. There have also been reports of violence and threats against those \"reviving\" and diffusing the original Circassian pre-Islamic faith. The relationship between \"habze\" and Islam varies between Circassian communities; for some, there is conflict between the two, while for others, such as in Israel, they are seen as complementary philosophies.\n\nSociety was organized by \"Adyghe khabze\", or Circassian custom. Many of these customs had equivalents throughout the mountains. It should be noted that the seemingly disorganized Circassians resisted the Russians just as effectively as the organized theocracy of Imam Shamil. The aristocracy was called \"warq\". Some aristocratic families held the rank of \"Pshi\" or prince and the eldest member of this family was the \"Pshi-tkhamade\" who was the tribal chief. Below the warq was the large class to \"tfokotl\", roughly yeomen or freemen, who had various duties to the warq. They were divided into clans of some sort. Below them were three classes approximating serfs or slaves. Of course, these Circassian social terms do not exactly match their European equivalents. Since everything was a matter custom, much depended on time, place, circumstances and personality. The three 'democratic' princedoms, Natukhai, Shapsug, and Abdzakh, managed their affairs by assemblies called \"Khase\" or larger ones called \"Zafes\". Decisions were made by general agreement and there was no formal mechanism to enforce decisions. The democratic princedoms, who were perhaps the majority, lived mainly in the mountains where they were relatively protected from the Russians. They seem to have retained their aristocrats, but with diminished powers. In the remaining 'feudal' princedoms power was theoretically in the hands of the \"Pshi-tkhamade\", although his power could be limited by Khases or other influential families.\n\nIn addition to the vertical relations of class there were many horizontal relations between unrelated persons. There was a strong tradition of hospitality similar to the Greek xenia. Many houses would have a \"kunakskaya\" or guest room. The duty of a host extended even to \"abreks\" or outlaws. Two men might be sworn brothers or \"kunaks\". There were brotherhoods of unrelated individuals called \"tleuzh\" who provided each other mutual support. It was common for a child to be raised by an \"atalyk\" or foster father. Criminal law was mainly concerned with reconciling the two parties. Adyghe khabze is sometimes called adat when it is contrasted to the kind of Islamic law advocated by people like Imam Shamil.\n\nThe traditional female clothing ( ) was very diverse and highly decorated and mainly depends on the region, class of family, occasions, and princedoms. The traditional female costume is composed of a dress ( ), coat ( ), shirt, pant ( ), vest ( ), lamb leather bra ( ), a variety of hats (\n"}
{"id": "50416177", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50416177", "title": "Cognitive ecology of religion", "text": "Cognitive ecology of religion\n\nCognitive ecology of religion is an integrative approach to studying how religious beliefs covary with social and natural dynamics of the environment. This is done by incorporating a cognitive ecological perspective to cross-cultural god concepts. Religious beliefs are thought to be a byproduct of domain-specific cognitive modules that give rise to religious cognition. The cognitive biases leading to religious belief are constraints on perceptions of the environment, which is part and parcel of a cognitive ecological approach. This means that they not only shape religious beliefs, but they are determinants of how successfully cultural beliefs are transmitted.\n\nFurthermore, cognition and behavior are inextricably linked, so the consequences of cultural concepts are associated with behavioral outcomes (i.e., continued interactions with the environment). For religion, behaviors often take the form of rituals and are similarly executed as a consequence of beliefs. Because the religious beliefs distributed in a population are relevant to their behavioral strategies and fine-tuned by natural selection, cross-cultural representations of gods and their characteristics are hypothesized to address ecologically relevant challenges. In other words, religious beliefs are thought to frequently involve solutions, insofar as evolved cognitive equipment can build them, to social and natural environmental problems faced by a given population.\n\nResearch in evolutionary psychology suggests that the brain is a coordinated network of domain-specific modules corresponding to various adaptations that emerged in our evolutionary history. Most claim that a capacity for religious thoughts is not a modular adaptation itself, but an evolutionary byproduct of multiple integrated mechanisms that arose independently and are designed for different functions. These modules are co-opted to give rise to religious thinking patterns, and they include theory of mind, essential psychology and the hyperactive agency detection device. Moreover, the cultural transmission of these ideas is contingent upon them being minimally counterintuitive.\n\nTheory of mind (ToM) is a capacity to attribute mental states, complete with thoughts, emotions and motivations, to other social agents. This adaptation is ubiquitous in primitive forms among various social species, but the complexity of human social life for long stretches of evolutionary history has facilitated a rich understanding of others' mental experiences to match. Cases of autism have been cited in support for the proposition that ToM is a distinct modular adaptation because of its distinctly narrow impact on ToM capacity. ToM is thought to lend itself to an intuitive sense of mind-body dualism, where the material body is animated by a non-material self (i.e., a \"soul\").\n\nFolk psychology among humans is characterized by essential thinking, or a tendency to interpret objects in terms of \"essences.\" This means that attributions of objects' underlying realities are intuitively inferred from a fuzzy set of the object's ontological features. Cognitive interpretations of essence give rise to concepts of purity, simplified good and evil concepts, and intuitive senses of meaning applied to teleology.\n\nThe capacity for agent detection has been an important modular adaptation for predator avoidance in humans. Some have called this mechanism a hyperactive agency detection device because of its fairly high rate of erroneous agency applications. In a potential predator situation, humans are forced to interpret an object's ontological features, infer agency or non-agency, and execute a behavioral response. Evolutionary theorists have cited the relatively low costs of incorrect agency inferences and the severe fitness costs of detection failure as a reason to suspect that a tendency to interpret naturalistic processes as agent behaviors is an adaptation. This creates a cognitive bias that leads humans to reason about objects and processes in agentive terms. This is particularly foundational to beliefs in a god or gods.\n\nThe integration of ToM, hyperactive applications of agency and essential psychology ultimately renders a cognitive tendency for humans to interact with the naturalistic processes of the world with the intentional stance. This is a perspective from which humans reason that objects and processes may be enacting behaviors intentionally, with meaningful, rational mental states of their own.\n\nReligious beliefs are successfully transmitted if they are compatible with the cognitive tools that reconstruct them upon reception. This means that they must be minimally counterintuitive, or that they violate few enough ontological features of an object or process, to make general sense while remaining memorable violations nonetheless. For example, the concept of a ghost exploits existing intuitions about mind-body dualism and only violates the usual coupling of mind and body. This creates a memorable concept of a non-material person that can move through walls and have motives of its own. On the other hand, a highly counterintuitive idea about an object that violates several of its ontological features, like a jealous Frisbee, is less likely to be culturally transmitted. This is because it is cognitively demanding, not easily reconstructed by the brain and thus, not easily reasoned about and remembered.\n\nReligious behaviors associated with culturally transmitted god concepts can be conceptualized as phenotypic strategies associated with the informational makeup of that cultural concept. Successfully transmitted religious concepts typically involve minimally counterintuitive violations of the intentional stance, which serves a cognitive constraint of cultural evolution. However, ecological factors also play a role in determining which religious behaviors (and their god concepts) are more likely to be replicated. This means that religious rituals associated with salient representational models of gods' minds and concerns are more likely to survive when they are adaptive strategies.\n\nCross-culturally, representational models of gods' minds take an array of diverse forms, such as anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figures, abstract forces, or some combination of these. Models of gods' minds typically fall within a spectrum between two extremes: on one end there are Big Gods, and on the other there are Local Gods. Big Gods are usually moralistic, punitive and omniscient, whereas Local Gods are often concerned about ritual behaviors, amoral and limited in knowledge. The subject matter that gods are believed to care across cultures fall into three categories, but may involve an admixture of more than one. These categories are (1) behaviors toward other people, (2) behaviors toward the gods themselves and (3) behaviors toward nature and/or the environment. While people impute these concerns to gods' minds, they often correspond to ecological challenges. This correspondence establishes why religious ideas often covary with ecological problems in the social and natural world: because these ideas enact behavioral strategies that solve them.\n\nCases of large-scale cooperation in complex societies are a widely studied example of a socioecological problem that religious beliefs address. Existing models of human cooperation have included kin selection, reciprocal altruism, indirect reciprocity and competitive helping. These models are robust across certain conditions likely relevant to the Pleistocene, but cooperation is easily eroded in large-scale, complex societies with frequently anonymous interactions between strangers. This is because profitable defections dominate cooperative strategies due to a lack of significant threats of punishment to defectors. For large-scale cooperation to succeed, a cultural coordination solution stabilized by sanction threats must exist.\n\nReligious rules addressing moral behavior are cultural coordination devices that can expand the scale of cooperative behavior by motivating prosociality. The most important stipulation here is that these devices must be enforced by punishment threats for people who do not behave prosocially. Frequent instances of anonymity in large-scale societies and the costs associated with punishment undermine sanction threats, but widespread beliefs in morally punitive and omniscient gods effectively outsource the punishment costs to a pervasive social monitor. This can effectively motivate widespread prosocial behavior in large-scale, complex societies.\n\nThis has been empirically supported from a few different angles. For instance, the cross-cultural prevalence of omniscient, moralistic gods (i.e., Big Gods) is positively correlated with society size and complexity. Examples of sharing behaviors in experimental economic games played by large-scale societies also reveal more generous behaviors when individuals are primed with Big God concepts before the game. These shifts toward prosociality are not replicated when similar experiments are applied to small-scale societies. Another recent cross-cultural study compiled experimental economic game data from multiple large- and small-scale societies around the world, where people with various religious beliefs played with local or distant people who were often of the same religion. When distant strangers of the same religion were paired in a game, their sharing behaviors were significantly more generous if their common beliefs involved Big God concepts. The researchers of this study argue that this supports the hypothesis stating that widespread beliefs in omniscient, morally punitive Big Gods may have contributed to the expansion of prosocial behavior.\n\nConcerns attributed to gods about how people behave toward the gods themselves are widespread and not easily disentangled from specific ecological conditions. The reason is intuitive; rational agents who do not care about their treatment are counterintuitive. Researchers investigating the socioecological functions of ritual behaviors in deference to gods claim that functionally, these rituals serve as costly signals of commitment to the group. Costly ritual displays are particularly public and ubiquitous in small-scale societies, functioning as social devices that promote intragroup cohesion. Reputations related to trustworthiness can be significantly based on adherence to ritual behavior expectations, and fulfillment of these expectations are often a joint function of other behavioral strategies relevant to separate domains of gods' concerns. More broadly, religious costly signals are an implicit expression of honest commitment to the rest of the group, indicating that the signaler is a dedicated part of other aspect of the group's coordinated solution strategies. In small- and large-scale societies alike, these rituals often coexist with other categories of gods' concerns.\n\nResource management and the prevention of material insecurity are more commonly associated with gods' concerns among small-scale societies. While other aspects of religious belief often address social interactions, problems of resource acquisition and security extend from attributed gods' concerns about peoples' interactions with their natural environment. An example of this effect has been alluded to by anthropologist Marvin Harris, who wrote about the economic reasons that Hindu beliefs, holding cows as sacred and forbidden from slaughter, were adaptive. According to Harris, the long-standing and stable benefits derived from many Hindu peoples' use of cows for labor and sources of fuel and fertilizer seemed to outweigh the costs of not eating them. Another ethnographic example of an adaptive use of animal resources was described by Roy Rappaport in 1984, who considered the reasons for ritual pig sacrifice in Papua New Guinea during times of intergroup conflict. These pigs were consuming local peoples' resources and creating resource insecurities that put a strain on the local groups, escalating the intergroup competition for resources and fueling their conflict. Thus, the ritualistic sacrifices alleviated the strain on local resources and mitigated the hostilities between groups. Furthermore, human behavioral ecology researchers have more recently studied burning practices among the Australian Martu people and the consequential increases in local biodiversity. These authors, in an ethnographic discussion of the Martu people, note that these burning practices stem from religious beliefs that their practices allow the world to continue existing as they know it.\n\nAnother ethnographic example of religious beliefs facilitating resource management comes from the Tyva people, a pastoralist population in southern Siberia. They associate ritual structures called cairns with local spirit masters (\"cher eezi\"). These structures demarcate local territories in which spirit masters reside, and the expectation to stop and give prayer offerings out of respect to \"cher eezi\" is embedded in peoples' beliefs about them. The \"cher eezi\" are believed to be amoral and care mostly about activity within their sacred territories, such as hunting and overexploiting resources that belong to them. More recently, Tyva people have begun facing new challenges associated with urbanization (e.g., pollution, alcohol abuse), and the \"cher eezi\" have been more frequently believed to be concerned about these same problems.\n"}

The railway's main purpose was to increase wood supply and timber transportation. A narrow gauge railway (760 mm) Comandău - Covasna was therefore built between 1889 and 1891.\n\nAfter two years Horn transferred the concession to forestry company Ardeleana, formerly Erdelyi Erdoipar RT. Ardeleana was founded in 1890 and was owned by Groedel brothers. This company built nine railway systems covering a total of 118.3 km. To enable the connection between Valea Zânelor (Fairy's Valley) and Șiclău, the Inclined Plane was inaugurated in 1890. The components were manufactured by Viennese firm Obach. The Inclined Plane was used every day for over a century (1892-1995). It transported daily around 30 cars, each having the capacity of 10m³ of wood.\n\nIn 1995, only a few years after celebrating its centenary, the Inclined Plane underwent a series of unfortunate events when a powerful storm toppled almost all the nearby trees. In addition, in 1997 the top control station was destroyed by fire. A drastic reduction in wood volumes ended the Inclined Plane on 1 October 1999 (along with 32 km of railway that formed the last remains of the forestry railways system from Comandău).\n\nThe train operated by allowing the weight of a loaded train to pull a lighter, empty train up the slope. A metal cable connected the two trains. Operation was controlled from the control room located in the top station. Trains ran on a normal track gauge (1435 mm). In the middle of the route a branch allowed the simultaneous passage of the wagons.\n\n"}

David Knowles (born Michael Clive Knowles, 29 September 1896 – 21 November 1974) was an English Benedictine monk, Catholic priest, and historian, who became Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Cambridge from 1954 to 1963. His works on monasticism in England from the times of Dunstan (909–988) to the dissolution of the monasteries are considered authoritative.\n\nBorn Michael Clive Knowles on 29 September 1896 in Studley, Warwickshire, England, Knowles was educated at Downside School, operated by the monks of Downside Abbey, and Christ's College, Cambridge, where he took a first in both philosophy and classics.\n\nIn 1923 Knowles became a member of the monastic community at Downside, being given the religious name of David, by which he was always known thereafter. After completing the novitiate he was sent by the abbot to the Pontifical Athenaeum of St. Anselm in Rome for his theological studies. Returning to Downside, he was ordained a priest. His research into the early monastic history of England was assisted by the library built up at Downside by Dom Raymund Webster.\n\nKnowles became the leader of a faction of the younger monks of the abbey who wanted to resist the growing demands of the school on the pattern of monastic life at the abbey. They advocated a more contemplative life as the goal of their lives as monks. This effort led to a period of major conflict within the community and he was transferred to Ealing Abbey, another teaching establishment.\n\nIn 1944 Knowles was elected into a research fellowship in Medieval Studies at Peterhouse in the University of Cambridge, where he would remain for the duration of his academic career.\n\nIn 1947 he was appointed as Professor of Medieval History and then, in 1954, he became the Regius Professor of Modern History, a post he held until his retirement in 1963.\n\nHe served as president of the Royal Historical Society from 1957 to 1961.\n\nWhile pursuing his academic life at Cambridge, Knowles was eventually, at the instigation of Abbot Christopher Butler, exclaustrated from Downside Abbey and finally released from his vows. Before his death on 21 November 1974 from a heart attack, however, he was readmitted to the order.\n\nKnowles is best known for his history of early English monasticism, \"The Monastic Order in England: A History of Its Development from the Times of St. Dunstan to the Fourth Lateran Council, 940–1216\" (1940). His three-volume work, \"The Religious Orders in England\" (1948–1959), is also highly regarded by scholars in English medieval ecclesiastical history. In 1962 he published a textbook, \"The Evolution of Medieval Thought\" (2nd ed. 1988), that \"dominated medieval history courses in U.S. colleges for a quarter of a century\". He has been criticised for excluding nunneries from consideration in \"Medieval Religious Houses\" on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence to draw on (a lack remedied in more recent scholarship).\n\n\n"}

The availability of a deficiency judgment depends on whether the lender has a recourse or nonrecourse loan, which is largely a matter of state law. In some jurisdictions, the original loan(s) obtained to purchase property is/are non-recourse, but subsequent refinancing of a first mortgage and/or acquisition of a 2nd (3rd, etc.) are recourse loans.\n\nIn short, many jurisdictions hold that the loans obtained at the acquisition of a property (\"purchase-money\") are non-recourse, and most, if not all, subsequent loans are recourse.\n\nStates that follow the title (trust-deed) theory of mortgages typically allow non-judicial foreclosure procedures, which are fast, but do not allow deficiency judgments. States that follow the lien theory of mortgages require judiciary foreclosure procedures, but allow deficiency judgments against the debtor, although some states have narrowed the time periods to seek a deficiency judgment. \n\nIt is important to note that there is a difference between a deficiency and a deficiency judgment. A \"deficiency\" is the difference between the amount owed on a loan and the total amount received/collected at the closing of a loan. A deficiency judgment is a court judgment that is a public record of the amount owed and by whom. In many states, items included in calculating the amount of a deficiency judgment include: the loan principal, accrued interest and attorney fees, less the amount the lender bid at the foreclosure sale. \n\nIn 2014 Geoff Walsh, a staff attorney with the U.S. National Consumer Law Center, said on NPR that the United States is \"seeing an uptick\" in the pursuit of deficiency claims, because technological developments have enabled large debt-buying institutions and mortgage insurers to more easily pursue former borrowers, who often don't know their legal rights.\n"}

{"id": "46886146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46886146", "title": "Discourse grammar", "text": "Discourse grammar\n\nDiscourse Grammar (DG) is a grammatical framework that grew out of the analysis of spoken and written linguistic discourse on the one hand, and of work on parenthetical expressions, including Simon C. Dik's study of extra-clausal constituents, on the other. Initiated by Gunther Kaltenböck, Bernd Heine and Tania Kuteva, the framework is based on the distinction between two organizing principles of grammar where one concerns the structure of sentences and the other the linguistic organization beyond the sentence.\n\nIn accordance with the perspective adopted in this framework, linguistic units such as formulae of social exchange, interjections, discourse markers and other prefabricated expressions, which tend to be assigned a more marginal status in many models of mainstream linguistics, are interpreted as playing an important role in structuring linguistic discourse.\n\nWork on Discourse Grammar (DG) has been inspired by a number of different works, in particular by Simon C. Dik's theory of Functional Grammar according to which linguistic discourse is composed of two different kinds of linguistic material, referred to, respectively, as clausal and extra-clausal constituents. On the other hand, it has benefitted greatly from research on the nature of parenthetical categories and the concept of supplements.\n\nDG is composed of all the linguistic resources that are available for designing texts, irrespective of whether these are spoken or written (or signed) texts. It is viewed both as an activity, a real-time interactional tool, and a knowledge store consisting of a set of conventional linguistic units plus their combinatorial potential. An elementary distinction between two main domains of speech processing is made, referred to as \"Sentence Grammar\" and \"Thetical Grammar\".\n\nSentence Grammar is organized in terms of propositional concepts and clauses and their combination. It has been the only, or the main subject of mainstream theories of linguistics. The concern of Thetical Grammar is with theticals, that is, with linguistic discourse units beyond the sentence, being syntactically, semantically, and typically also prosodically detached from expressions of Sentence Grammar. These units include what is traditionally referred to as parenthetical constructions but are not restricted to them. The main categories of Thetical Grammar are conceptual theticals (including comment clauses, discourse markers, etc.) as well as various other extra-clausal categories such as vocatives, formulae of social exchange, and interjections. While being separate in principle, the two domains interact in multiple ways in shaping linguistic discourse. The main way of interaction is via cooptation, an operation whereby chunks of Sentence Grammar such as clauses, phrases, words, or any other units are deployed for use in Thetical Grammar.\n\nBeing a relatively young framework, DG has so far found only limited applications. Work has focused mainly on comment clauses, discourse markers, final particles, and insubordination. Furthermore, DG as a descriptive tool has for the most part been restricted to the study of English. Analysis within this framework is now being extended to non-European languages. More detailed research has been carried out already on Akie, a traditional hunter-gatherer language of the Nilotic family spoken in north-central Tanzania. A grammar of this language based on DG has been published, the use of theticals in the organization of texts has been studied, and institutional frames surfacing from the analysis of Akie texts have been identified using Thetical Grammar as a basis.\n\nIn another line of research, DG has been extended to the study of language contact. As the work on the discourse in bilingual situations has shown, theticals play an important role both in code-switching and borrowing. Furthermore, there is reason to assume that the distinction between Sentence Grammar and Thetical Grammar may shed new light on the question of how human language or languages evolved.\n\nFinally, a considerable part of the research is devoted to the question of whether the distinction between the two domains is reflected in neural activity. As this research suggests, there appears to be a corresponding distinction in brain lateralization, in that Sentence Grammar correlates primarily with left-hemisphere activity whereas Thetical grammar appears to be more strongly associated with right-hemisphere activation.\n\nThat discourse organization operates simultaneously in two different dimensions has also been pointed out in a number of other research traditions. Thus, a distinction akin to that between Sentence Grammar and Thetical Grammar is also made in some psycholinguistic studies on comprehension where a contrast between propositional representation and discourse model is made, and in neurolinguistic discourse analysis there is a related distinction between referential and modalizing speech. In other frameworks, specific manifestations of the distinction are highlighted, such as that between microgrammar and macrogrammar, or between an analytic and a holistic mode of processing, or between conceptual and procedural meaning in the theory of Relevance Grammar.\n\nOTC Workshop: https://otc-workshop.univie.ac.at/\n"}

Heroes World was acquired by Marvel Comics in late 1994 to act as the publisher's sole distributor. This ill-fated move, combined with other marketplace factors of the time, resulted in the financial failure of many other comics distributors and retailers — and the near collapse of the entire North American comic book market.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ivan Snyder was head of licensing in Marvel Comics Group's merchandising department, in charge of selling various Marvel licensed products via mail order. After a change in management in the mid-1970s, Marvel discontinued the mail order service, and Snyder purchased the business in 1975, renaming it Superhero Enterprises. Initially running the business out his basement, Snyder shortly thereafter moved into a storefront in Morristown, New Jersey, with a catalog showroom store format. A second store was opened in a Livingston shopping mall, with DC Comics products added to their product mix.\n\nWhen the former Mego Corporation trademark \"Superhero\" was purchased by Marvel and DC, Superheroes Enterprise was forced to change its name to Heroes World. By 1982, Heroes World's retail chain had expanded to 12 locations, while it continued its mail order distribution business. (The Heroes World catalog was produced in conjunction with the Dover, New Jersey-based Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art.)\n\nBy late 1994, Heroes World was North America's third largest comics distributor (behind Diamond Comics Distributors and Capital City Distribution). On December 28, 1994, Heroes World was bought by Marvel Comics to act as the company's exclusive distributor, thus reducing other distributors' market share by more than a third. The change took effect with books shipped July 1995. As industry veteran Chuck Rozanski notes:\n\nThe ripple effect resulted in the survival of only one other major North American distributor, Diamond.\n\nHeroes World's new role as Marvel's exclusive distributor was a failure from the beginning. Lacking the infrastructure to handle Marvel's huge weekly orders resulted in extensive shipment and billing mistakes, errors which caused great consternation among the thousands of comics specialty shops affected. Writes Rozanski:\n\nThese factors, combined with the collapse of the comics speculation market, did indeed result in many comics stores closing their doors for good.\n\nThroughout 1995 and 1996, Heroes World continued to flounder, facing lost business and lawsuits. Finally, in 1997 the company went out of business, and Marvel returned to Diamond Distributors, which by that point was the only major distributor left standing.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "165851", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165851", "title": "Industrial design", "text": "Industrial design\n\nIndustrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication. This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation.\n\nAll manufactured products are the result of a design process, but the nature of this process can take many forms: it can be conducted by an individual or a large team; it can emphasize intuitive creativity or calculated scientific decision-making, and often emphasizes both at the same time; and it can be influenced by factors as varied as materials, production processes, business strategy and prevailing social, commercial or aesthetic attitudes. The role of an industrial designer is to create and execute design solutions for problems of form, function, usability, physical ergonomics, marketing, brand development, sustainability, and sales.\n\nFor several millennia before the onset of industrialisation, design, technical expertise, and manufacturing were often done by individuals craftsmen, who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation, according to their own manual skill, the requirements of their clients, experience accumulated through their own experimentation, and knowledge passed on to them through training or apprenticeship.\n\nThe division of labour that underlies the practice of industrial design did have precedents in the pre-industrial era. The growth of trade in the medieval period led to the emergence of large workshops in cities such as Florence, Venice, Nuremberg and Bruges, where groups of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique. Competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in Italy and Germany of pattern books: collections of engravings illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products, and whose creation took place in advance of their application. The use of drawing to specify how something was to be constructed later was first developed by architects and shipwrights during the Italian Renaissance.\n\nIn the 17th century, the growth of artistic patronage in centralized monarchical states such as France led to large government-operated manufacturing operations epitomised by the Gobelins Manufactory, opened in Paris in 1667 by Louis XIV. Here teams of hundreds of craftsmen, including specialist artists, decorators and engravers, produced sumptuously decorated products ranging from tapestries and furniture to metalwork and coaches, all under the creative supervision of the King's leading artist Charles Le Brun. This pattern of large-scale royal patronage was repeated in the court porcelain factories of the early 18th century, such as the Meissen porcelain workshops established in 1709 by the Grand Duke of Saxony, where patterns from a range of sources, including court goldsmiths, sculptors and engravers, were used as models for the vessels and figurines for which it became famous. As long as reproduction remained craft-based, however, the form and artistic quality of the product remained in the hands of the individual craftsman, and tended to decline as the scale of production increased.\n\nThe emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialisation and mechanisation that began with the industrial revolution in Great Britain in the mid 18th century. The rise of industrial manufacture changed the way objects were made, urbanisation changed patterns of consumption, the growth of empires broadened tastes and diversified markets, and the emergence of a wider middle class created demand for fashionable styles from a much larger and more heterogeneous population.\n\nThe first use of the term \"industrial design\" is often attributed to the industrial designer Joseph Claude Sinel in 1919 (although he himself denied this in interviews), but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade. Christopher Dresser is considered among the first independent industrial designers. Industrial design's origins lie in the industrialization of consumer products. For instance the Deutscher Werkbund, founded in 1907 and a precursor to the Bauhaus, was a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques, to put Germany on a competitive footing with Great Britain and the United States.\n\nThe earliest use of the term may have been in \"The Art Union\", A monthly Journal of the Fine Arts, 1839.\n\n\"The Practical Draughtsman's Book of Industrial Design\" by Jacques-Eugène Armengaud was printed in 1853. The subtitle of the (translated) work explains, that it wants to offer a \"complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing.\" The study of those types of technical drawing, according to Armengaud, belong to the field of industrial design. This work paved the way for a big expansion in the field drawing education in France, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nRobert Lepper helped to establish one of the country's first industrial design degree programs in 1934 at Carnegie Institute of Technology.\n\nProduct design and industrial design overlap in the fields of user interface design, information design, and interaction design. Various schools of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects, ranging from pure art colleges and design schools (product styling), to mixed programs of engineering and design, to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design, to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics, the so-called \"functionalist\" school. Except for certain functional areas of overlap between industrial design and engineering design, educational programs in the U.S. for engineering design require accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) in contrast to programs for industrial design which are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).\n\nMost industrial designers complete a design or related program at a vocational school or university. Relevant programs include graphic design, interior design, industrial design, architectural technology, and drafting Diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide. Diplomas and degrees take two to four years of study. The study results in a Bachelor of Industrial Design (B.I.D.), Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) or Bachelor of Fine Arts (B.F.A.). Afterwards, the bachelor programme can be extended to postgraduate degrees such as Master of Design, Master of Fine Arts and others to a Master of Arts or Master of Science.\n\nIndustrial design studies function and form—and the connection between product, user, and environment. Generally, industrial design professionals work in small scale design, rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships. Industrial designers don't usually design motors, electrical circuits, or gearing that make machines move, but they may affect technical aspects through usability design and form relationships. Usually, they work with other professionals such as engineers who design the mechanical aspects of the product assuring functionality and manufacturability, and with marketers to identify and fulfill customer needs and expectations.\nDesign, itself, is often difficult to describe to non-designers and engineers, because the meaning accepted by the design community is not made of words. Instead, the definition is created as a result of acquiring a critical framework for the analysis and creation of artifacts. One of the many accepted (but intentionally unspecific) definitions of design originates from Carnegie Mellon's School of Design, \"Design is the process of taking something from its existing state and moving it to a preferred state\" (Simon, Herbert A. \"The sciences of the artiﬁcial.\" Cambridge, MA (1969, 1981, 1996)). This applies to new artifacts, whose existing state is undefined, and previously created artifacts, whose state stands to be improved.\n\nIndustrial design can overlap significantly with engineering design, and in different countries the boundaries of the two concepts can vary, but in general engineering focuses principally on functionality or utility of products, whereas industrial design focuses principally on \"aesthetic and user-interface\" aspects of products. In many jurisdictions this distinction is effectively defined by credentials and/or licensure required to engage in the practice of engineering. \"Industrial design\" as such does not overlap much with the engineering sub-discipline of industrial engineering, except for the latter's sub-specialty of ergonomics.\n\nAt the 29th General Assembly in Gwangju, South Korea, 2015, the Professional Practise Committee unveiled a renewed definition of industrial design as follows:\n\"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences.\"\nAn extended version of this definition is as follows:\n\"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences. Industrial Design bridges the gap between what is and what’s possible. It is a trans-disciplinary profession that harnesses creativity to resolve problems and co-create solutions with the intent of making a product, system, service, experience or a business, better. At its heart, Industrial Design provides a more optimistic way of looking at the future by reframing problems as opportunities. It links innovation, technology, research, business and customers to provide new value and competitive advantage across economic, social and environmental spheres.\nIndustrial Designers place the human in the centre of the process. They acquire a deep understanding of user needs through empathy and apply a pragmatic, user centric problem solving process to design products, systems, services and experiences. They are strategic stakeholders in the innovation process and are uniquely positioned to bridge varied professional disciplines and business interests. They value the economic, social and environmental impact of their work and their contribution towards co-creating a better quality of life. \"\n\nAlthough the process of design may be considered 'creative,' many analytical processes also take place. In fact, many industrial designers often use various design methodologies in their creative process. Some of the processes that are commonly used are user research, sketching, comparative product research, model making, prototyping and testing. These processes are best defined by the industrial designers and/or other team members. Industrial designers often utilize 3D software, computer-aided industrial design and CAD programs to move from concept to production. They may also build a prototype first and then use industrial CT scanning to test for interior defects and generate a CAD model. From this the manufacturing process may be modified to improve the product.\n\nProduct characteristics specified by industrial designers may include the overall form of the object, the location of details with respect to one another, colors, texture, form, and aspects concerning the use of the product. Additionally they may specify aspects concerning the production process, choice of materials and the way the product is presented to the consumer at the point of sale. The inclusion of industrial designers in a product development process may lead to added value by improving usability, lowering production costs and developing more appealing products.\n\nIndustrial design may also focus on technical concepts, products, and processes. In addition to aesthetics, usability, and ergonomics, it can also encompass engineering, usefulness, market placement, and other concerns—such as psychology, desire, and the emotional attachment of the user. These values and accompanying aspects that form the basis of industrial design can vary—between different schools of thought, and among practicing designers.\n\nIndustrial design rights are intellectual property rights that make exclusive the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian. A design patent would also be considered under this category. An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Under the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs, a WIPO-administered treaty, a procedure for an international registration exists. An applicant can file for a single international deposit with WIPO or with the national office in a country party to the treaty. The design will then be protected in as many member countries of the treaty as desired.\n\nA number of industrial designers have made such a significant impact on culture and daily life that their work is documented by historians of social science. Alvar Aalto, renowned as an architect, also designed a significant number of household items, such as chairs, stools, lamps, a tea-cart, and vases. Raymond Loewy was a prolific American designer who is responsible for the Royal Dutch Shell corporate logo, the original BP logo (in use until 2000), the PRR S1 steam locomotive, the Studebaker Starlight (including the later iconic bulletnose), as well as Schick electric razors, Electrolux refrigerators, short-wave radios, Le Creuset French ovens, and a complete line of modern furniture, among many other items.\n\nRichard A. Teague, who spent most of his career with the American Motor Company, originated the concept of using interchangeable body panels so as to create a wide array of different vehicles using the same stampings. He was responsible for such unique automotive designs as the Pacer, Gremlin, Matador coupe, Jeep Cherokee, and the complete interior of the Eagle Premier.\n\nMilwaukee's Brooks Stevens was best known for his Milwaukee Road Skytop Lounge car and Oscar Mayer Wienermobile designs, among others.\n\nViktor Schreckengost designed bicycles manufactured by Murray bicycles for Murray and Sears, Roebuck and Company. With engineer Ray Spiller, he designed the first truck with a cab-over-engine configuration, a design in use to this day. Schreckengost also founded The Cleveland Institute of Art's school of industrial design.\n\nOskar Barnack was a German optical engineer, precision mechanic, industrial designer, and the father of 35mm photography. He developed the Leica, which became the hallmark for photography for 50 years, and remains a high-water mark for mechanical and optical design.\n\nCharles and Ray Eames were most famous for their pioneering furniture designs, such as the Eames Lounge Chair Wood and Eames Lounge Chair. Other influential designers included Henry Dreyfuss, Eliot Noyes, John Vassos, and Russel Wright.\n\nDieter Rams is a German industrial designer closely associated with the consumer products company Braun and the Functionalist school of industrial design.\n\nMany of Apple's recent iconic products were designed by Sir Jonathan Ive.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "233478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=233478", "title": "Jackalope", "text": "Jackalope\n\nThe jackalope is a mythical animal of North American folklore (a fearsome critter) described as a jackrabbit with antelope horns. The word \"jackalope\" is a portmanteau of \"jackrabbit\" and \"antelope.\" Many jackalope taxidermy mounts, including the original, are made with deer antlers.\n\nIn the 1930s, Douglas Herrick and his brother, hunters with taxidermy skills, popularized the American jackalope by grafting deer antlers onto a jackrabbit carcass and selling the combination to a local hotel in Douglas, Wyoming. Thereafter, they made and sold many similar jackalopes to a retail outlet in South Dakota, and another taxidermist continues to manufacture the horned rabbits in the 21st century. Stuffed and mounted, jackalopes are found in many bars and other places in the United States; stores catering to tourists sell jackalope postcards and other paraphernalia, and commercial entities in America and elsewhere have used the word \"jackalope\" or a jackalope logo as part of their marketing strategies. The jackalope has appeared in published stories, poems, television shows, video games, and a low-budget mockumentary film. The Wyoming Legislature has considered bills to make the jackalope the state's official mythological creature.\n\nThe underlying legend of the jackalope, upon which the Wyoming taxidermists were building, may be related to similar stories in other cultures and other historical times. Researchers suggest that at least some of the tales of horned hares were inspired by sightings of rabbits infected with the \"Shope papilloma virus\". It causes horn- and antler-like tumors to grow in various places on a rabbit's head and body.\n\nFolklorists see the jackalope as one of a group of fabled creatures common to American culture since Colonial days. These appear in tall tales about hodags, giant turtles, Bigfoot, and many other mysterious beasts and in novels like \"Moby-Dick\". The tales lend themselves to comic hoaxing by entrepreneurs who seek attention for their products, their persons, or their towns.\n\n\"Jackalope\" is a portmanteau word that combines two words, \"jackrabbit\" and \"antelope\".\n\nJackrabbits are actually hares rather than rabbits though both are mammals in the order \"Lagomorpha\". Wyoming is home to three species of hares, all in the genus \"Lepus\". These are the black-tailed jackrabbit, the white-tailed jackrabbit, and the snowshoe hare.\n\nThe antelope is actually a pronghorn (\"Antilocapra americana\") rather than an antelope, although one of its colloquial names in North America is \"antelope\".\nSome of the largest herds of wild pronghorns, which are found only in western North America, are in Wyoming. The adults grow to about tall, weigh up to , and can run at sustained speeds approaching .\n\nStories or descriptions of animal hybrids have appeared in many cultures worldwide. A 13th-century Persian work depicts a rabbit with a single horn, like a unicorn. In Europe, the horned rabbit appeared in Medieval and Renaissance folklore in Bavaria (the wolpertinger) and elsewhere. Natural history texts such as \"Historiae Naturalis de Quadrupetibus Libri\" (\"The History Book of Natural Quadrangles\") by Joannes Jonstonus (John Jonston) in the 17th century and illustrations such as \"Animalia Qvadrvpedia et Reptilia (Terra): Plate XLVII\" by Joris Hoefnagel (1522–1600) in the 16th century included the horned hare. These early scientific texts described and illustrated the hybrids as though they were real creatures, but by the end of the 18th century scientists generally rejected the idea of horned hares as a biological species.\nReferences to horned rabbits may originate in sightings of rabbits affected by the Shope papilloma virus, named for Richard E. Shope, M.D., who described it in a scientific journal in 1933. Shope initially examined wild cottontail rabbits that had been shot by hunters in Iowa and later examined wild rabbits from Kansas. They had \"numerous horn-like protuberances on the skin over various parts of their bodies. The animals were referred to popularly as 'horned' or 'warty' rabbits.\" Legends about horned rabbits also occur in Asia and Africa as well as Europe, and researchers suspect the changes induced by the virus might underlie at least some of those tales.\n\nIn Central America, mythological references to a horned rabbit creature can be found in Huichol legends. The Huichol oral tradition has passed down tales of a horned rabbit and of the deer getting horns from the rabbit. The rabbit and deer were paired, though not combined as a hybrid, as day signs in the calendar of the Mesoamerican period of the Aztecs, as twins, brothers, even the sun and moon.\n\n\"The New York Times\" attributes the American jackalope's origin to a 1932 hunting outing involving Douglas Herrick (1920–2003) of Douglas, Wyoming. Herrick and his brother had studied taxidermy by mail order as teenagers, and when the brothers returned from a hunting trip for jackrabbits, Herrick tossed a carcass into the taxidermy store, where it came to rest beside a pair of deer antlers. The accidental combination of animal forms sparked Herrick's idea for a jackalope. The first jackalope the brothers put together was sold for $10 to Roy Ball, who displayed it in Douglas' La Bonte Hotel. The mounted head was stolen in 1977. The jackalope became a popular local attraction in Douglas, where the Chamber of Commerce issues Jackalope Hunting Licenses to tourists. The tags are good for hunting during official jackalope season, which occurs for only one day: June 31 (a nonexistent date as June has 30 days), from midnight to 2 a.m. The hunter must have an IQ greater than 50 but not over 72. Thousands of \"licenses\" have been issued. In Herrick's home town of Douglas, there is an statue of a jackalope, and the town hosts an annual Jackalope Days Celebration in early June.\nBuilding on the Herrick's success, Frank English of Rapid City, South Dakota has made and sold many thousands of jackalopes since retiring from the Air Force in 1981. He is the only supplier of the altered animal heads to Cabela's, a major outdoor-theme retail company. His standard jackalopes and \"world-record\" jackalopes sell for about $150.\n\nIn \"Man and Beast in American Comic Legend\", folklorist Richard Dorson recounts the Douglas variant but also an alternative that will \"surely infuriate the residents of Douglas...\". According to Dorson, in \"Mythical Creatures of the North Country\" (1969), historian Walker D. Wyman acknowledged the existence of what he called the Alkali Area Jackalope of the western United States. However, he expressed doubt that it predated the Jack-pine Jackalope of Minnesota and Wisconsin, \"a mythological throwback that defies even the most competent biologists of the region.\" Wyman claimed there were three known specimens of this primary jackalope—in Augusta in west-central Wisconsin; Cornucopia, along the south shore of Lake Superior; and in a north shore museum and lumber camp—all \"presumably shot by careless hunters during the deer season.\"\n\nIn a 1978 revision and expansion of his book, which includes material on the rubberado porcupine, the snoligoster, the three-tailed bavalorus, the squonk, and many other creatures, Wyman devotes four pages to the jackalope. In a turnabout from his earlier claims of a North Country origin for the antlered hare, he says, \"The center of its vast range seems to be Wyoming.\" Evidence of wide dispersal of \"Lepus antilocapra wyomingensis\" from its original range, he claims, are labels such as \"Tioga, Pennsylvania,\" and \"Hongkong\" stamped on mounted jackalope heads in barrooms across the United States.\n\nThe jackalope is subject to many outlandish and largely tongue-in-cheek claims embedded in tall tales about its habits. Jackalopes are said to be so dangerous that hunters are advised to wear stovepipes on their legs to keep from being gored. Stores in Douglas sell jackalope milk, but \"The New York Times\" questions its authenticity on grounds that milking a jackalope is known to be fraught with risk. One of the ways to catch a jackalope is to entice it with whiskey, the jackalope's beverage of choice.\n\nThe jackalope can imitate the human voice, according to legend. During the days of the Old West, when cowboys gathered by the campfires singing at night, jackalopes could be heard mimicking their voices or singing along, usually as a tenor. It is said that jackalopes, the rare \"Lepus antilocapra\", only breed during lightning flashes and that their antlers make the act difficult despite the hare's reputation for fertility.\n\nIn 2005, the legislature of Wyoming considered a bill to make the jackalope the state's official mythological creature. It passed the House by a 45–12 margin, but the session ended before the Senate could take up the bill, which died. In 2013, following the death of the bill's sponsor, Dave Edwards, the state legislature reintroduced the bill. It again passed the House but died in the rules committee of the Senate. In 2015, three state representatives put forth the jackalope proposal again, this time as House Bill 66, and again it passed the House but died in a Senate committee. One of the co-sponsors, Dan Zwonitzer, said, \"I’ll keep bringing it back until it passes.\"\n\nIn 2014, the Wyoming Lottery adopted a jackalope logo for its lottery tickets and marketing materials. Lottery officials chose the fictitious animal, which they named \"YoLo\", over the bucking horse and other state symbols.\n\nSince Herrick and his brother began selling manipulated taxidermy heads in the 1930s, such trophies, as well as jackalope postcards and related gift-shop items, can be found in many places beyond Douglas. The student magazine of the Santa Fe University of Art and Design in New Mexico is called \"The Jackalope\". On the other side of the world, The Hop Factory craft beer cafe in Newcastle, Australia, uses a leaping jackalope as its logo. In 1986, James Abdnor, a senator from South Dakota, gave U.S. President Ronald Reagan a stuffed jackalope (rabbit head with antlers) during a presidential campaign stop in Rapid City.\n\nMany books, including a large number written for children, feature the jackalope. A search for \"jackalope\" in the WorldCat listings of early 2015 produced 225 hits, including 57 for books. Among them is \"Juan and the Jackalope: A Children's Book in Verse\" by Rudolfo Anaya. The WorldCat summary of Anaya's book says: \"Competing for the hand of the lovely Rosita and her rhubarb pie, Juan rides a Jackalope in a race against Pecos Bill.\" A short story, \"Jackalope Wives\" by Ursula Vernon, has been nominated for a 2014 Nebula Award.\n\nMusicians have used the jackalope in various ways. R. Carlos Nakai, a Native American flute player, formerly belonged to a group called Jackalope. In the late 1980s, it performed what Nakai called \"synthacousticpunkarachiNavajazz\", which combined \"improvisation, visual art, storytelling, dance and dramatic theatrical effects.\" Nakai said he wanted people to dream as they listened to the music. Jakalope is a Canadian alternative pop/rock group formed in 2003 by Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie. The band Miike Snow uses the jackalope as its logo. Band member Andrew Wyatt said during an interview in 2012 that the logo was meant to signify experiment and adventure. Of the 225 Worldcat hits resulting from a search for \"jackalope\", 95 were related to music.\n\nJackalopes have appeared in movies and on television. A jackalope named \"Jack Ching Bada Bing\" was a recurring character in a series of sketches on the television show \"America's Funniest People\". The show's host, Dave Coulier, voiced the rascally hybrid. In 2003, Pixar featured a jackalope in the short animation \"Boundin'\". The jackalope gave helpful advice to a lamb who was feeling sad after being shorn.\n\nJackalopes have appeared in video games. In \"Red Dead Redemption\", the player is able to hunt and skin jackalopes. In \"Redneck Rampage\", jackalopes, including one the size of a bus, are enemies. Jackalopes are part of the action in \"Guild Wars 2\".\n\nA low-budget jackalope mockumentary, \"Stagbunny\", aired in Casper and Douglas in 2006. The movie included interviews with the owner of a Douglas sporting goods store who claimed to harbor a live jackalope on his premises and with a paleontologist who explained the natural history of the jackalope and its place in the fossil record.\n\nBeginning in 1997, the Central Hockey League included a team called the Odessa Jackalopes. The team joined the South Division of the North American Hockey League before the 2011–12 season. An Odessa sports writer expressed concern about the team's name, which he found insufficiently intimidating and which sounded like \"something you might eat for breakfast.\"\n\nJackalope Brewing Company, the first commercial brewery in Tennessee run by women, opened in Nashville in 2011. Its four craft beers are Thunder Ann, Rompo, Bearwalker, and Leghorn.\n\nFolklorist John A. Gutowski sees in the Douglas jackalope an example of an American tall tale publicized by a local community that seeks wider recognition. Through a combination of hoax and media activity, the town or other community draws attention to itself for social or economic reasons. A common adjunct to this activity involves the creation of an annual festival to perpetuate the town's association with the local legend.\n\nGutowski finds evidence of what he calls the \"protofestival\" pattern throughout the United States. In addition to the jackalope, his examples include the sea serpent of Nantucket, which in 1937 led to \"stories of armadas hunting the monster, and footprint discoveries by local businessmen\", accompanied by wide publicity. In similar fashion, Newport, Arkansas, publicized its White River Monster, and Algiers, Louisiana, claimed to be home to a flying Devil Man. Ware, Massachusetts, drew media attention to its local reputation for alligator sightings. Perry, New York, held Silver Lake Sea Serpent Festivals based on a local hoax. The Hodag Festival in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, celebrates \"discovery\" of a prehistoric creature in a nearby pit. Willow Creek, California, hosts an annual Bigfoot Festival. Since 1950, Churubusco, Indiana, has celebrated Turtle Days, based on a story, part real and part invented, about the hunt for the Beast of Busco, a snapping turtle said to be living in a nearby lake.\n\nCommon to these tales, Gutowski says, is the recurring motif of the quest for the mythical animal, often a monster. The same motif, he notes, appears in American novels such as \"Moby Dick\" and \"Old Man and the Sea\" and in monster movies such as \"King Kong\" and \"Jaws\" and in world literature such as \"Beowulf\". The monster motif also appears in tales of contemporary places outside the United States, such as Scotland, with its Loch Ness Monster. What is not global, Gutowski says, is the embrace of local monster tales by American communities that put them to use through \"public relations hoaxes, boisterous boosterism, and [a] carnival atmosphere... \".\n\nFolklorist Richard M. Dorson also cites the \"booster impulse, mingled with entrepreneurial hoaxing\" as the way that Douglas with its jackalope, Churubusco with its giant turtle, and other towns with their own local legends rise above anonymity. He traces the impulse and the methods to the promotional literature of colonial times that depicted North America as an earthly paradise. Much later, in the 19th century, settlers transferred that optimistic vision to the American West, where it culminated in \"boosterism\". Although other capitalist countries advertise their products, Dorson says, \"...the intensity of the American ethos in advertising, huckstering, attention-getting, media-manipulating to sell a product, a personality, a town is beyond compare.\"\n\n"}

July 21, 1929 in Newark, New Jersey) was an American library and museum director who sought to make these cultural institutions relevant to the daily lives of citizens. As a public librarian for forty years Dana promoted the benefits of reading, pioneered direct access to shelved materials, and innovated specialized library services of all types.\n\nDana studied law at Dartmouth College, where he graduated in 1878. Moving to Denver in 1880, Dana passed the Colorado bar and began to practice. Dana moved to New York and was admitted to the bar in 1883. Taking a position as the editor of the \"Ashby Avalanche\" in 1885, Dana moved to Minnesota but resettled in Colorado after a short time. Dana married in 1888 to Adine Rowena Wagener. They had no children.\n\nBecause of the reputation he cultivated as a learned man and his connections in the Denver Public Schools, the superintendent Aaron Gove nominated Dana as the City's first librarian. Dana directed the Denver Public Library from 1889 to 1898, pioneering the patron's right to open stacks, allowing them to browse for themselves instead of having library staff intervening for every request. Dana wanted to update libraries and envisioned them as vibrant community centers rather than collections of relics that appealed to only a small segment of people. Under Dana's leadership the Denver Public Library also pioneered the first-ever collection devoted to children's literature. He was personally opposed to the concept of storytime, preferring for his children's library to focus on the continuing education of school teachers. Dana served as president of the American Library Association in 1895/96.\n\nThe city began discussing lowering Dana's salary over mounting public controversy concerning a city tax levied for the school district and, by extension, the library. Dana also drew criticism for circulating \"gold bug\" literature at the library; Colorado was economically dependent on mining silver and the gold standard was a political issue. Dana felt that library patrons should have information on both sides of the issue.\n\nBack east again, he served as a librarian at the Springfield, Massachusetts public library from 1898 to 1902 and continued many of his Denver policies there. One of the changes Dana implemented at the Springfield library was to the physical building itself. He had workers tear down many of the railings and generally open the floor plan. Dana was adamant that patron be permitted to browse the stacks: \"Let the shelves be open, and the public admitted to them, and let the open shelves strike the keynote of the whole administration. The whole library should be permeated with a cheerful and accommodating atmosphere.\" Although these terms were not invented until nearly a century later, Dana concerned himself heavily with the ergonomics and usability of the library collections and facilities. He left Springfield after refusing to become involved in a power struggle with the library's patrons.\n\nDana provided leadership at the Newark Public Library in Newark, New Jersey, from 1902 until his death in 1929. He established foreign language collections for immigrants and also developed a special collection for the business community. This \"Business Branch\" was the first of its kind in the nation. Dana founded the Special Libraries Association, serving as its first president from 1909 to 1911.\n\nDana founded the Newark Museum in 1909, directing it until his death. The Museum was exceptional because it included contemporary American commercial products as folk art as well as factory-made products. John C. Dana personally believed that purchasing European oil painting was a waste of money and thus supported American art movements. He did not like modern art, but he believed in the principle of a universal museum and thus ordered purchases of art associated with the Ashcan School. In 1915, he curated the exhibition \"Clay Products of New Jersey\" where he displayed two porcelain toilets from Trenton Potteries, part of his work toward including industrial arts in the museum. Cotton also began the Newark Museum's notable Tibetan collection.\n\nDana was quoted as saying, “A great department store, easily reached, open at all hours, is more like a good museum of art than any of the museums we have yet established”. A biographer said of Dana, “He would have found a library school curriculum intolerable, and doubtless a library school would have found him intolerable”.\n\nAfter Dana's death, his successor at the Newark Public Library referred to him as “The First Citizen of Newark”. The pre-legal department of New Jersey Law School, transitioning from a two-year to a four-year curriculum in 1930, renamed the school \"Dana College\" (Watkins 2006, 2). Six years after his death, the city of Newark appointed October 6, 1935 as \"John Cotton Dana Day\". Rutgers-Newark's main library, opened in 1967, is named after Dana.\n\nThe American Library Association offers the \"John Cotton Dana Public Relations Award\" to libraries with exceptional public relations.\n\nThe NJ Associations of Museums has an annual award in his name, presented to an individual \"for outstanding contributions to the New Jersey museum profession.\"\n\nThe highest honor of the Special Libraries Association is the \"John Cotton Dana Award\", recognizing an information professional for lifetime achievement.\n\nDana is recognized in the Library Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\n"}

For this reason they are sometimes called \"subject-matter services\".\n\nLooseleaf services are most commonly used for research in areas of law which change rapidly due to regulatory and administrative developments (such as tax law, environmental law, financial regulation, and labor law). Looseleaf services are typically contained in ring binders to keep them updated, because they are published fairly frequently (at minimum monthly, sometimes weekly or bi-weekly) in order to keep the information therein current. Most law libraries have a subscription to several of these services, and many of the more popular services are available electronically as well.\n\nIn an interfiled looseleaf service, individual pages can be removed and replaced with more recent printings, eliminating the need for pocket parts or similar supplements. Most of the looseleaf services offered by Commerce Clearing House are of the interfiled type.\n\nNewsletter-type looseleaf services are published as topical newsletters, which are then filed by law librarians under the appropriate topic headings for future reference.\n\nOne of the best-known looseleaf services, \"United States Law Week\", is of this type. Most of the looseleaf services published by Bureau of National Affairs are newsletter-style.\n\nLooseleaf service was invented by Richard Prentice Ettinger in 1914, founder of Prentice Hall. As a 19-year-old assistant to his Princeton University tax professor, he published the professor's book at his own risk. The first print run sold well and he ordered a second print run from an outside printing company. On the day that this second print run arrived, the United States Congress changed the tax law enough that the book was outdated. Faced with this challenge, Ettinger came up with the idea of cutting the pages (leaves) loose, replacing the few pages where changes in the tax code had occurred, drilling holes through the pages and putting them into a ring-binder. Even though it was more costly, it did have the benefit that future changes could easily be accommodated by simply exchanging a single leaf or group of pages.\n\n\n"}

After that he worked as an associate member of staff at the university and for a military museum in Ingolstadt.\n\nIn the 1980s Junkelmann became well known in Germany for his work in experimental archeology. He reconstructed and tested Roman weapons and army gear. In 1985 in connection with the 2000 year celebration of the city of Augsburg he organized a large experimental reenactment of the life and work conditions of Roman legionaries. The experiment consisted of a month-long march from Verona to Augsburg including the crossing of the Alps. For the complete trip the original Roman army gear and equipment was used and the typical legionary tasks were performed. Later Junkelmann went on to perform a similar experiments for the Roman cavalry. He authored several books and documentaries on his archeological experiments.

{"id": "19159", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19159", "title": "Mile", "text": "Mile\n\nThe mile is an English unit of length of linear measure equal to 5,280 feet, or 1,760 yards, and standardised as exactly 1,609.344 metres by international agreement in 1959.\n\nWith qualifiers, \"mile\" is also used to describe or translate a wide range of units derived from or roughly equivalent to the Roman mile, such as the nautical mile (now 1.852 km exactly), the Italian mile (roughly 1.852 km), and the Chinese mile (now 500 m exactly). The Romans divided their mile into 5,000 roman feet but the greater importance of furlongs in pre-modern England meant that the statute mile was made equivalent to 8 furlongs or 5,280 feet in 1593. This form of the mile then spread to the British-colonized nations some of which continue to employ the mile. The US Geological Survey now employs the metre for official purposes but legacy data from its 1927 geodetic datum has meant that a separate US survey mile ( km) continues to see some use. While most countries replaced the mile with the kilometre when switching to the International System of Units, the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as Liberia, Myanmar, the United Kingdom, the United States, and a number of countries with fewer than one million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories, or have close historical ties with the UK or US.\n\nThe mile was usually abbreviated m. in the past but is now sometimes written as mi to avoid confusion with the SI metre. However, derived units, such as miles per hour or miles per gallon, continue to be universally abbreviated as mph and mpg, respectively.\n\nThe modern English word \"mile\" derives from Middle English ' and Old English ', which was cognate with all other Germanic terms for \"miles\". These derived from apocopated forms of the Latin ' or ', the plural of ' or ', literally \"thousand\" but used as a clipped form of ' or ', the Roman mile of one thousand paces.\n\nThe present international mile is usually what is understood by the unqualified term \"mile\". When this distance needs to be distinguished from the nautical mile, the international mile may also be described as a \"land mile\" or \"statute mile\". In British English, the \"statute mile\" may refer to the present international miles or to any other form of English mile since the 1593 Act of Parliament, which set it as a distance of 1,760 yards. Under American law, however, the \"statute mile\" refers to the US survey mile. Foreign and historical units translated into English as miles usually employ a qualifier to describe the kind of mile being used but this may be omitted if it is obvious from the context, such as a discussion of the 2nd-century Antonine Itinerary describing its distances in terms of \"miles\" rather than \"Roman miles\".\n\nThe mile has been variously abbreviated—with and without a trailing period—as m, M, ml, and mi. The American National Institute of Standards and Technology now uses and recommends mi in order to avoid confusion with the SI metre (m) and millilitre (ml). However, derived units such as miles per hour or miles per gallon continue to be abbreviated as mph and mpg rather than mi/h and mi/gal. In the United Kingdom road signs use m as the abbreviation for mile though height and width restrictions also use m as the abbreviation for the metre, which may be displayed alongside feet and inches. The BBC style holds that \"There is no acceptable abbreviation for 'miles'\" and so it should be spelt out when used in describing areas.\n\nThe Roman mile (',  \"thousand paces\";  m.p.; also ' and \"\") consisted of a thousand paces as measured by every other step—as in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times. The ancient Romans, marching their armies through uncharted territory, would often push a carved stick in the ground after each 1,000 paces. Well-fed and harshly driven Roman legionaries in good weather thus created longer miles. The distance was indirectly standardised by Agrippa's establishment of a standard Roman foot (Agrippa's own) in 29 BC, and the definition of a pace as 5 feet. An Imperial Roman mile thus denoted 5,000 Roman feet. Surveyors and specialized equipment such as the decempeda and dioptra then spread its use. In modern times, Agrippa's Imperial Roman mile was empirically estimated to have been about in length. In Hellenic areas of the Empire, the Roman mile (, \"mílion\") was used beside the native Greek units as equivalent to 8 stadia of 600 Greek feet. The \"mílion\" continued to be used as a Byzantine unit and was also used as the name of the zero mile marker for the Byzantine Empire, the Milion, located at the head of the Mese near Hagia Sophia.\n\nThe Roman mile also spread throughout Europe, with its local variations giving rise to the different units below.\n\nAlso arising from the Roman mile is the \"milestone\". All roads radiated out from the Roman Forum throughout the Empire – 50,000 miles of stone-paved roads. At every mile was placed a shaped stone, on which was carved a Roman numeral, indicating the number of miles from the center of Rome – the Forum. Hence, one always knew how far one was from Rome.\n\nThe Italian mile (',  ') was traditionally considered a direct continuation of the Roman mile, equal to 1000 paces, although its actual value over time or between regions could vary greatly. It was often used in international contexts from the Middle Ages into the 17th century and is thus also known as the \"geographical mile\", although the geographical mile is now a separate standard unit.\n\nThe Arabic mile (, \"al-mīl\") was not the common Arabic unit of length; instead, Arabs and Persians traditionally used the longer parasang or \"Arabic league\". The Arabic mile was, however, used by medieval geographers and scientists and constituted a kind of precursor to the nautical or geographical mile. It extended the Roman mile to fit an astronomical approximation of 1 arcminute of latitude measured directly north-and-south along a meridian. Although the precise value of the approximation remains disputed, it was somewhere between 1.8 and 2.0 km.\n\nThe \"old English mile\" of the medieval and early modern periods varied but seems to have measured about 1.3 international miles (1.9 km). The English long continued the Roman computations of the mile as 5000 feet, 1000 paces, or 8 longer divisions, which they equated with their \"furrow's length\" or furlong.\n\nThe origins of English units are \"extremely vague and uncertain\", but seem to have been a combination of the Roman system with native British and Germanic systems both derived from multiples of the barleycorn. Probably by the reign of Edgar in the 10th century, the nominal prototype physical standard of English length was an arm-length iron bar (a yardstick) held by the king at Winchester; the foot was then one-third of its length. Henry I was said to have made a new standard in 1101 based on his own arm. Following the issuance of Magna Carta, the barons of Parliament directed John and his son to keep the king's standard measure (\"\") and weight at the Exchequer, which thereafter verified local standards until its abolition in the 19th century. New brass standards are known to have been constructed under Henry VII and Elizabeth I.\n\nArnold's \"Customs of London\" recorded a mile shorter than previous ones, coming to 0.947 international miles or 1.524 km.\nThe English statute mile was established by a Weights and Measures Act of Parliament in 1593 during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The act on the Composition of Yards and Perches had shortened the length of the foot and its associated measures, causing the two methods of determining the mile to diverge. Owing to the importance of the surveyor's rod in deeds and surveying undertaken under Henry VIII, decreasing the length of the rod by would have amounted to a significant tax increase. Parliament instead opted to maintain the mile of 8 furlongs (which were derived from the rod) and to increase the number of feet per mile from the old Roman value. The applicable passage of the statute reads: \"A Mile shall contain eight Furlongs, every Furlong forty Poles, and every Pole shall contain sixteen Foot and half.\" The statute mile therefore contained 5,280 feet or 1,760 yards. The distance was not uniformly adopted. Robert Morden had multiple scales on his 17th-century maps which included continuing local values: his map of Hampshire, for example, bore two different \"miles\" with a ratio of and his map of Dorset had three scales with a ratio of . In both cases, the traditional local units remained longer than the statute mile.\n\nThe Welsh mile (' or ') was 3 miles and 1470 yards long (6.17 km). It comprised 9000 paces ('), each of 3 Welsh feet (') of 9 inches, usually reckoned as equivalent to the English inch. Along with other Welsh units, it was said to have been codified under Dyfnwal the Bald and Silent and retained unchanged by Hywel the Good. Along with other Welsh units, it was discontinued following the conquest of Wales by the English under Edward I in the 13th century.\n\nThe Scots mile was longer than the English mile, as mentioned by Robert Burns in the first verse of his poem \"Tam o' Shanter\". It comprised 8 (Scots) furlongs divided into 320 falls or faws (Scots rods). It varied from place to place but the most accepted equivalencies are 1,976 Imperial yards (1.123 statute miles or 1.81 km).\n\nIt was legally abolished three times: first by a 1685 act of the Scottish Parliament, again by the 1707 Treaty of Union with England, and finally by the Weights and Measures Act 1824. It had continued in use as a customary unit through the 18th century but had become obsolete by its final abolition.\n\nThe Irish mile (' or ') measured 2240 yards: approximately 1.27 statute miles or 2.048 kilometres. It was used in Ireland from the 16th century plantations until the 19th century, with residual use into the 20th century. The units were based on \"English measure\" but used a linear perch measuring as opposed to the English rod of .\n\n\nThe international mile is precisely equal to (or  km as a fraction). It was established as part of the 1959 international yard and pound agreement reached by the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, which resolved small but measurable differences that had arisen from separate physical standards each country had maintained for the yard. As with the earlier statute mile, it continues to comprise 1,760 yards or 5,280 feet.\n\nThe old Imperial value of the yard was used in converting measurements to metric values in India in a 1976 Act of the Indian Parliament. However, the current National Topographic Database of the Survey of India is based on the metric WGS-84 datum, which is also used by the Global Positioning System.\n\nThe difference from the previous standards was 2 ppm, or about 3.2 millimeters ( inch) per mile. The U.S. standard was slightly longer and the old Imperial standards had been slightly shorter than the international mile. When the international mile was introduced in English-speaking countries, the basic geodetic datum in America was the North American Datum of 1927 (NAD27). This had been constructed by triangulation based on the definition of the foot in the Mendenhall Order of 1893, with 1 foot =  metres and the definition was retained for data derived from NAD27, but renamed the \"U.S. survey foot\" to distinguish it from the international foot.\n\nThe exact length of the land mile varied slightly among English-speaking countries until the international yard and pound agreement in 1959 established the yard as exactly 0.9144 metres, giving a mile exactly 1,609.344 metres. The U.S. adopted this international mile for most purposes, but retained the pre-1959 mile for some land-survey data, terming it the \"U. S. survey mile\". In the United States, \"statute mile\" normally refers to the survey mile, about 3.219 mm ( inch) longer than the international mile (the international mile is exactly 0.0002% less than the U.S. survey mile).\n\nWhile most countries replaced the mile with the kilometre when switching to the International System of Units, the international mile continues to be used in some countries, such as Liberia, Myanmar, the United Kingdom and the United States. It is furthermore used in a number of countries with vastly less than a million inhabitants, most of which are UK or US territories, or have close historical ties with the UK or US: American Samoa, Bahamas, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Falkland Islands, Grenada, Guam, The N. Mariana Islands, Samoa, St. Lucia, St. Vincent & The Grenadines, St. Helena, St. Kitts & Nevis, the Turks & Caicos Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nThe mile is even encountered in Canada, though this is predominantly in rail transport and horse racing, as the roadways have been metricated since 1977.\n\nThe \"U.S. survey mile\" is 5,280 survey feet, or about 1,609.347 metres. In the United States, \"statute mile\" formally refers to the survey mile, but for most purposes, the difference between the survey mile and the international mile is insignificant—one international mile is U.S. survey miles—so \"statute mile\" can be used for either. But in some cases, such as in the U.S. State Plane Coordinate Systems (SPCSs), which can stretch over hundreds of miles, the accumulated difference \"can be\" significant, so it is important to note that the reference is to the U.S. survey mile.\n\nThe United States redefined its yard in 1893, but this resulted in U.S. and Imperial measures of distance having very slightly different lengths.\n\nThe North American Datum of 1983 (NAD83), which replaced the NAD27, is defined in meters. State Plane Coordinate Systems were then updated, but the National Geodetic Survey left individual states to decide which (if any) definition of the foot they would use. All State Plane Coordinate Systems are defined in meters, and 42 of the 50 states only use the metre-based State Plane Coordinate Systems. However, eight states also have State Plane Coordinate Systems defined in feet, seven of them in U.S. Survey feet and one in international feet.\n\nState legislation in the U.S. is important for determining which conversion factor from the metric datum is to be used for land surveying and real estate transactions, even though the difference (2 ppm) is hardly significant, given the precision of normal surveying measurements over short distances (usually much less than a mile). Twenty-four states have legislated that surveying measures be based on the U.S. survey foot, eight have legislated that they be based on the international foot, and eighteen have not specified which conversion factor to use.\n\nThe \"nautical mile\" was originally defined as one minute of arc along a meridian of the Earth. Navigators use dividers to step off the distance between two points on the navigational chart, then place the open dividers against the minutes-of-latitude scale at the edge of the chart, and read off the distance in nautical miles. The Earth is not perfectly spherical but an oblate spheroid, so the length of a minute of latitude increases by 1% from the equator to the poles. Using the WGS84 ellipsoid, the commonly accepted Earth model for many purposes today, one minute of latitude at the WGS84 equator is 6,046 feet and at the poles is 6,107.5 feet. The average is about 6,076 feet (about 1,852 metres or 1.15 statute miles).\n\nIn the United States, the nautical mile was defined in the 19th century as 6,080.2 feet (1,853.249 m), whereas in the United Kingdom, the \"Admiralty nautical mile\" was defined as 6,080 feet (1,853.184 m) and was about one minute of latitude in the latitudes of the south of the UK. Other nations had different definitions of the nautical mile, but it is now internationally defined to be exactly .\n\nThe nautical mile per hour is known as the knot. Nautical miles and knots are almost universally used for aeronautical and maritime navigation, because of their relationship with degrees and minutes of latitude and the convenience of using the latitude scale on a map for distance measuring.\n\nThe data mile is used in radar-related subjects and is equal to 6,000 feet (1.8288 kilometres). The radar mile is a unit of time (in the same way that the light year is a unit of distance), equal to the time required for a radar pulse to travel a distance of two miles (one mile each way). Thus, the radar statute mile is 10.8 μs and the radar nautical mile is 12.4 μs.\n\nThe geographical mile is based upon the length of a meridian of latitude. The German geographical mile () was previously ° of latitude (7.4127 km).\n\nCities in the continental United States often have streets laid out by miles. Detroit, Indianapolis, Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Miami, are several examples. Typically the largest streets are about a mile apart, with others at smaller intervals. In the Manhattan borough of New York City \"streets\" are close to 20 per mile, while the major numbered \"avenues\" are about six per mile. (Centerline to centerline, 42nd Street to 22nd Street is supposed to be 5250 feet while 42nd Street to 62nd Street is supposed to be 5276 ft 8 in.)\n\nThe informal term \"metric mile\" is used in sports such as track and field athletics and speed skating to denote a distance of .

{"id": "1604030", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1604030", "title": "Phonological awareness", "text": "Phonological awareness\n\nPhonological awareness is an individual's awareness of the phonological structure, or sound structure, of words. Phonological awareness is an important and reliable predictor of later reading ability and has, therefore, been the focus of much research.\n\nPhonological awareness involves the detection and manipulation of sounds at three levels of sound structure: (1) syllables, (2) onsets and rimes, and (3) phonemes. Awareness of these sounds is demonstrated through a variety of tasks (see below). Available published tests of phonological awareness (for example PhAB2) are often used by teachers, psychologists and speech therapists to help understand difficulties in this aspect of language and literacy. Although the tasks vary, they share the basic requirement that some operation (e.g., identifying, comparing, separating, combining, generating) be performed on the sounds. It is assumed that the individual performing these tasks must have awareness of the units of sound in order to perform the operation.\n\nPhonological awareness is one component of a larger phonological processing system used for speaking and listening. Phonological awareness is different from other phonological abilities in that it is a metalinguistic skill, requiring conscious awareness and reflection on the structure of language. Other phonological abilities: such as attending to speech, discriminating between sounds, holding sounds in memory: can be performed without conscious reflection. However, these other phonological abilities are prerequisite to the development of phonological awareness. Therefore, general listening skills are often among those included in phonological awareness instruction.\n\nThe terms \"phonemic awareness\" and \"phonics\" are often used interchangeably with phonological awareness. However, these terms have different meanings. Phonemic awareness is a subset of phonological awareness that focuses specifically on recognizing and manipulating phonemes, the smallest units of sound. Phonics requires students to know and match letters or letter patterns with sounds, learn the rules of spelling, and use this information to decode (read) and encode (write) words. Phonemic awareness relates only to speech sounds, not to alphabet letters or sound-spellings, so it is not necessary for students to have alphabet knowledge in order to develop a basic phonemic awareness of language.\n\nPhonological awareness tasks (adapted from Virginia Department of Education (1998): and Gillon (2004)\n\nThe ability to attend to and distinguish environmental and speech sounds from one another\n\n\n\n\nAlthough some two-year-old children demonstrate phonological awareness, for most children, phonological awareness appears in the third year, with accelerating growth through the fourth and fifth years. Phonological awareness skills develop in a predictable pattern similar across languages progressing from larger to smaller units of sound (that is, from words to syllables to onsets and syllable rimes to phonemes). Tasks used to demonstrate awareness of these sounds have their own developmental sequence. For example, tasks involving the detection of similar or dissimilar sounds (e.g., oddity tasks) are mastered before tasks requiring the manipulation of sounds (e.g., deletion tasks), and blending tasks are mastered before segmenting tasks. It should be noted that the acquisition of phonological awareness skills does not progress in a linear sequence; rather, children continue to refine skills they have acquired while they learn new skills.\n\nThe development of phonological awareness is closely tied to overall language and speech development. Vocabulary size, as well as other measures of receptive and expressive semantics, syntax, and morphology, are consistent concurrent and longitudinal predictors of phonological awareness. Consistent with this finding, children with communication disorders often have poor phonological awareness.\n\nPhonological development and articulatory accuracy is often correlated to phonological awareness skills, both for children with typical speech and those with disordered speech. In addition to milestones of speech and language development, speech and language processing abilities are also related to phonological awareness: both speech perception and verbal short-term memory have been concurrently and predicatively correlated with phonological awareness abilities.\n\nPhonological awareness is an important determiner of success in learning to read and spell. For most children, strong readers have strong phonological awareness, and poor readers have poor phonological awareness skills. Phonological awareness skills in the preschool and kindergarten years also strongly predict how well a child will read in the school years. In addition, interventions to improve phonological awareness abilities lead to significantly improved reading abilities. Phonological awareness instruction improves reading and spelling skills, but the reverse is also true: literacy instruction improves phonological awareness skills. The relationship between phonological awareness and reading abilities changes over time. All levels of phonological awareness ability (syllable, onset-rhyme, and phoneme) contribute to reading abilities in the Kindergarten through second grade. However, beyond the second grade, phoneme-level abilities play a stronger role.\n\nPhonological awareness and literacy is often explained by decoding and encoding. In reading, decoding refers to the process of relating a word's written representation to its verbal representation. Especially in the early stages of reading, decoding involves mapping letters in the word to their corresponding sounds, and then combining those sounds to form a verbal word. Encoding: a process used in spelling: is similar, although the process goes in the opposite direction, with the word's verbal representation is encoded in a written form. Again, especially in the early stages of reading, encoding involves determining the sounds in a verbal word, and then mapping those sounds onto a letter sequence in order to spell out the written word. In both encoding and decoding, phonological awareness is needed because the child must know the sounds in the words in order to relate them to the letter sounds.\n\nPhonological awareness is an auditory skill that is developed through a variety of activities that expose students to the sound structure of the language and teach them to recognize, identify and manipulate it. Listening skills are an important foundation for the development of phonological awareness and they generally develop first. Therefore, the scope and sequence of instruction in early childhood literacy curriculum typically begins with a focus on listening, as teachers instruct children to attend to and distinguish sounds, including environmental sounds and the sounds of speech. Early phonological awareness instruction also involves the use of songs, nursery rhymes and games to help students to become alert to speech sounds and rhythms, rather than meanings, including rhyme, alliteration, onomatopoeia, and prosody. While exposure to different sound patterns in songs and rhymes is a start towards developing phonological awareness, exposure in itself is not enough, because the traditional actions that go along with songs and nursery rhymes typically focus on helping students to understand the meanings of words, not attend to the sounds. Therefore, different strategies must be implemented to aid students in becoming alert to sounds instead. Specific activities that involve students in attending to and demonstrating recognition of the sounds of language include waving hands when rhymes are heard, stomping feet along with alliterations, clapping the syllables in names, and slowly stretching out arms when segmenting words. Phonological awareness is technically only about sounds and students do not need to know the letters of the alphabet to be able to develop phonological awareness.\n\nStudents in primary education sometimes learn phonological awareness in the context of literacy activities, particularly phonemic awareness. Some research demonstrates that, at least for older children, there may be utility to extending the development of phonological awareness skills in the context of activities that involve letters and spelling. A number of scholars have been working on this approach.\n\n\n"}

Religious texts may be used to provide meaning and purpose, evoke a deeper connection with the divine, convey religious truths, promote religious experience, foster communal identity, and guide individual and communal religious practice. Religious texts often communicate the practices or values of a religious traditions and can be looked to as a set of guiding principles which dictate physical, mental, spiritual, or historical elements considered important to a specific religion. The terms 'sacred' text and 'religious' text are not necessarily interchangeable in that some religious texts are believed to be sacred because of their nature as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired, whereas some religious texts are simply narratives pertaining to the general themes, practices, or important figures of the specific religion, and not necessarily considered sacred by itself. A core function of a religious text making it sacred is its ceremonial and liturgical role, particularly in relation to sacred time, the liturgical year, the divine efficacy and subsequent holy service; in a more general sense, its performance.\n\nIt is not possible to create an exhaustive list of religious texts, because there is no single definition of which texts are recognized as religious.\n\nOne of the oldest known religious texts is the Kesh Temple Hymn of Ancient Sumer, a set of inscribed clay tablets which scholars typically date around 2600 BCE. The Epic of Gilgamesh from Sumer, although only considered by some scholars as a religious text, has origins as early as 2150-2000 BCE, and stands as one of the earliest literary works that includes various mythological figures and themes of interaction with the divine. The Rig Veda of ancient Hinduism is estimated to have been composed between 1700–1100 BCE, which not only denotes it as one of the oldest known religious texts, but also one of the oldest written religious text which is still actively used in religious practice to this day, though no actual evidence of this text exists prior to the 13th century AD.\n\nThere are many possible dates given to the first writings which can be connected to Talmudic and Biblical traditions, the earliest of which is found in scribal documentation of the 8th century BCE, followed by administrative documentation from temples of the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, with another common date being the 2nd century BCE. Although a significant text in the history of religious text because of its widespread use among religious denominations and its continued use throughout history, the texts of the Abrahamic traditions are a good example of the lack of certainty surrounding dates and definitions of religious texts.\n\nHigh rates of mass production and distribution of religious texts did not begin until the invention of the printing press in 1440, before which all religious texts were hand written copies, of which there were relatively limited quantities in circulation.\n\nA religious canon refers to the generally accepted, uniform, and often unchanging collection of texts which a religious denomination considers comprehensive in terms of their specific application of texts. For example, the content of a Protestant Bible may differ from the content of a Catholic Bible - insofar as the Protestant Old Testament does not include the Deuterocanonical books while the Roman Catholic canon does. Protestants and Catholics use the same 27 book NT canon, as well as the same 39 book OT protocanon, also shared by Jews.\n\nThe word \"canon\" comes from the Sumerian word meaning \"standard\".\n\nThe terms \"scripture\" and variations such as \"Holy Writ\", \"Holy Scripture\" or \"Sacred Scripture\" are defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as terms which specifically apply to Biblical text and the Christian tradition.\n\nHierographology (Ancient Greek: ἱερός, \"hieros\", \"sacred\" or \"holy\"; γραφή, \"graphe\", \"writing\"; λόγος, \"logos\", \"word\" or \"reason\") (archaically also 'hierology') is the study of sacred texts.\n\nThe following is an in-exhaustive list of links to specific religious texts which may be used for further, more in-depth study.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooks by Bahá'u'lláh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach four Kirati people have their own Scripture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarious New Age religions may regard any of the following texts as inspired:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-LaVeyan Satanists don't use any specific holy book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She attempted another campaign for public office in 1997, this time as a Democrat, and was arrested that same year.\n\nRuthann Greenzweig was born in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from Cornell University, she moved to Maryland with her husband and two young children, acquired a law degree at Catholic University and became a real estate developer. She completed several big deals and became a member of the Montgomery County, Maryland, Planning Board. In 1994, she lost the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator from Maryland to former Tennessee Senator Bill Brock, who was in turn defeated by incumbent Paul Sarbanes. After Brock lost to Sarbanes, Aron sued Brock for slander based on comments he made about her during the primary campaign. Brock had said, at a September 1994 press conference:\n\nIn reality, juries had ruled against Aron in two civil lawsuits in which former business partners accused her of fraud or other offenses. A federal judge overturned one of the verdicts, and Aron settled both suits out of court after agreeing to pay about $175,000 in each case. At the slander trial, Aron cited Brock's use of the term \"convicted\" for verdicts that had come in civil court. Lawyer Arthur G. Kahn, who had prosecuted one of the fraud cases, testified against Aron at the February 1996 trial, which Aron lost. Nonetheless, it was the first time that a losing federal candidate was able to get the winner into court over words spoken in a campaign.\n\nAron was arrested in June 1997 for trying to hire a hitman; she approached William \"Billy\" Mossberg, a local landfill owner, who immediately went to the police. The police asked Mossberg to work with them and he then agreed with Aron to murder her husband and Kahn. She was ousted from the Planning Board in August 1997. At the time of her arrest, she was planning to run, as a Democrat, for an at-large seat on the Montgomery County Council. In her first trial, she used nine psychiatrists/psychologists to argue that a brain injury and her childhood abuse had rendered her incapable of realizing that what she was doing was illegal. Aron was diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder by multiple psychiatrists. One juror held out on her behalf, and a mistrial was declared. In July 1998, Aron pleaded no contest, and in November 1998 she was sentenced to two consecutive 18-month prison sentences.\n\nAron was released in 2001 and said she moved to New York City. Her son, Joshua Aron, died in the September 11 attacks in 2001. He was working at Cantor Fitzgerald in the World Trade Center at the time of his death. He was a graduate of Cornell University. Aron's daughter, Dana Aron Weiner, is a psychologist who works at Northwestern University in Chicago. At Aron's trial, Weiner cried to the judge that her mother should be set free with no jail time.\n\nAron was still living in New York City as of September 2011. In 2004, Aron's case was profiled on the Oxygen Network series \"Snapped\", which profiles female criminals, and also on the truTV series \"Dominick Dunne's Power, Privilege, and Justice\". In 2006, her case was profiled in an episode of \"City Confidential\".\n\nIt was reported in May 2016 that Aron is going by the name Ruth Ann Green and living in Montgomery County, Maryland, and in Florida. She has self-published an autobiography claiming her innocence on the charges on which she was convicted.\n"}

Sarcasm may employ ambivalence, although sarcasm is not necessarily ironic. \nMost noticeable in spoken word, sarcasm is mainly distinguished by the inflection with which it is spoken and is largely context-dependent.\n\nThe word comes from the Greek σαρκασμός (\"sarkasmós\") which is taken from σαρκάζειν (\"sarkázein\") meaning \"to tear flesh, bite the lip in rage, sneer\".\n\nIt is first recorded in English in 1579, in an annotation to \"The Shepheardes Calender\" by Edmund Spenser:\n\nHowever, the word \"sarcastic\", meaning \"Characterized by or involving sarcasm; given to the use of sarcasm; bitterly cutting or caustic\", doesn't appear until 1695.\n\nIn its entry on irony, Dictionary.com describes sarcasm thus:\nIn sarcasm, ridicule or mockery is used harshly, often crudely and contemptuously, for destructive purposes. It may be used in an indirect manner, and have the form of irony, as in \"What a fine musician you turned out to be!,\" \"It's like you're a whole different person now...,\" and \"Oh... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years!\" or it may be used in the form of a direct statement, \"You couldn't play one piece correctly if you had two assistants.\" The distinctive quality of sarcasm is present in the spoken word and manifested chiefly by vocal inflection ...\nDistinguishing sarcasm from banter, and referring to the use of irony in sarcasm, Derek Bousfield writes that sarcasm is: The use of strategies which, \"on the surface\" appear to be appropriate to the situation, but are meant to be taken as meaning the opposite in terms of \"face management\". That is, the utterance which appears, on the surface, to maintain or enhance the face of the recipient actually attacks and damages the face of the recipient. ... \"sarcasm\" is an insincere form of politeness which is used to offend one's interlocutor.\n\n17.'Never a truer word said in jest': A Pragmastylistic Analysis of Impoliteness as Banter in Henry IV, Part I, Derek Bousfield (University of Huddersfield, UK)\n\nJohn Haiman writes: \"There is an extremely close connection between sarcasm and irony, and literary theorists in particular often treat sarcasm as simply the crudest and least interesting form of irony.\" Also, he adds:\nFirst, situations may be ironic, but only people can be sarcastic. Second, people may be unintentionally ironic, but sarcasm requires intention. What is essential to sarcasm is that it is overt irony intentionally used by the speaker as a form of verbal aggression.\nWhile Henry Watson Fowler writes:\nSarcasm does not necessarily involve irony. But irony, or the use of expressions conveying different things according as they are interpreted, is so often made the vehicle of sarcasm ... The essence of sarcasm is the intention of giving pain by (ironical or other) bitter words.\nProfessionals in psychology and related fields have long looked upon sarcasm negatively, particularly noting that sarcasm tends to be a maladaptive coping mechanism for those with unresolved anger or frustrations. Psychologist Clifford N. Lazarus describes sarcasm as \"hostility disguised as humor\". While an occasional sarcastic comment may enliven a conversation, Lazarus suggests that too frequent use of sarcasm tends to \"overwhelm the emotional flavor of any conversation\".\n\nUnderstanding the subtlety of this usage requires second-order interpretation of the speaker's or writer's intentions; different parts of the brain must work together to understand sarcasm. This sophisticated understanding can be lacking in some people with certain forms of brain damage, dementia and autism (although not always), and this perception has been located by MRI in the right parahippocampal gyrus. Research has shown that people with damage in the prefrontal cortex have difficulty understanding non-verbal aspects of language like tone, Richard Delmonico, a neuropsychologist at the University of California, Davis, told an interviewer. Such research could help doctors distinguish between different types of neurodegenerative diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to David Salmon, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego.\n\nIn William Brant's \"Critique of Sarcastic Reason\", sarcasm is hypothesized to develop as a cognitive and emotional tool that adolescents use in order to test the borders of politeness and truth in conversation. Sarcasm recognition and expression both require the development of understanding forms of language, especially if sarcasm occurs without a cue or signal (e.g., a sarcastic tone or rolling the eyes). Sarcasm is argued to be more sophisticated than lying because lying is expressed as early as the age of three, but sarcastic expressions take place much later during development (Brant, 2012). According to Brant (2012, 145-6), sarcasm is\n\nCultural perspectives on sarcasm vary widely with more than a few cultures and linguistic groups finding it offensive to varying degrees. Thomas Carlyle despised it: \"Sarcasm I now see to be, in general, the language of the devil; for which reason I have long since as good as renounced it\". Fyodor Dostoyevsky, on the other hand, recognized in it a cry of pain: Sarcasm, he said, was \"usually the last refuge of modest and chaste-souled people when the privacy of their soul is coarsely and intrusively invaded.\" RFC 1855, a collection of guidelines for Internet communications, includes a warning to be especially careful with it as it \"may not travel well.\" A professional translator has advised that international business executives \"should generally avoid sarcasm in intercultural business conversations and written communications\" because of the difficulties in translating sarcasm.\n\nA 2015 study by L. Huang, F. Gino and A.D. Galinsky of the Harvard Business School \"tests a novel theoretical model in which both the construction and interpretation of sarcasm lead to greater creativity because they activate abstract thinking.\" \n\nIn English, sarcasm is often telegraphed with kinesic/prosodic cues by speaking more slowly and with a lower pitch. Similarly, Dutch uses a lowered pitch; sometimes to such an extent that the expression is reduced to a mere mumble. But other research shows that there are many ways that real speakers signal sarcastic intentions. One study found that in Cantonese, sarcasm is indicated by raising the fundamental frequency of one's voice. In Amharic, rising intonation is used to show sarcasm.\n\nThough in the English language there is no standard accepted method to denote irony or sarcasm in written conversation, several forms of punctuation have been proposed. Among the oldest and frequently attested are the percontation point—furthered by Henry Denham in the 1580s—and the irony mark—furthered by Alcanter de Brahm in the 19th century. Both of these marks were represented visually by a ⸮ backwards question mark (unicode U+2E2E). Each of these punctuation marks are primarily used to indicate that a sentence should be understood as ironic, but not necessarily designate sarcasm that is not ironic. By contrast, more recent proposals, such as the snark mark, or the use of a following tilde are specifically intended to denote sarcasm rather than irony. A bracketed exclamation point or question mark as well as scare quotes are also sometimes used to express irony or ironic sarcasm.\n\nIn certain Ethiopic languages, sarcasm and unreal phrases are indicated at the end of a sentence with a sarcasm mark called temherte slaq, a character that looks like an inverted exclamation point ¡. The usage directly parallels John Wilkins' 1668 proposal to use the inverted exclamation point as an irony mark. A proposal by Asteraye Tsigie and Daniel Yacob in 1999 to include the \"temherte slaq\" in unicode was unsuccessful.\n\nA French company has developed an analytics tool that claims to have up to 80% accuracy in identifying sarcastic comments posted online.\n\nIn June 2014, the United States Secret Service requested bids for software that would identify sarcasm in tweets.\n\nIn late August 2016, North Korea banned sarcasm against the government. It was reported that the government gave the warnings in mass meetings across the country. Subsequent media reports suggest that North Korea banned sarcasm altogether.\n\n"}
{"id": "27009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27009", "title": "Soap opera", "text": "Soap opera\n\nA soap opera is an ongoing drama serial on television or radio, featuring the lives of many characters and their emotional relationships. The term \"soap opera\" originated from radio dramas being sponsored by soap manufacturers.\n\nBBC Radio's \"The Archers\", first broadcast in 1950, is the world’s longest-running radio soap opera; the world's longest-running television soap opera is \"Coronation Street\", first broadcast on ITV in 1960.\n\nThe first serial considered to be a \"soap opera\" was \"Painted Dreams\", which debuted on October 20, 1930 on Chicago radio station WGN. Early radio series such as \"Painted Dreams\" were broadcast in weekday daytime slots, usually five days a week. Most of the listeners would be housewives.Thus, the shows were aimed at and consumed by a predominantly female audience. The first nationally broadcast radio soap opera was \"Clara, Lu, and Em\", which aired on the NBC Blue Network at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time on January 27, 1931.\n\nOne of the defining features that makes a television program a soap opera, according to Albert Moran, is that form of television that works with a continuous open narrative. While Spanish language telenovelas are sometimes called \"soap operas,\" telenovelas have conflicts that get resolved and a definite ending after (more or less) a year of daily weekday airing. But with soap operas each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode\". In 2012, \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Robert Lloyd wrote of daily dramas, \"Although melodramatically eventful, soap operas such as this also have a luxury of space that makes them seem more naturalistic; indeed, the economics of the form demand long scenes, and conversations that a 22-episodes-per-season weekly series might dispense with in half a dozen lines of dialogue may be drawn out, as here, for pages. You spend more time even with the minor characters; the apparent villains grow less apparently villainous.\"\n\nSoap opera storylines run concurrently, intersect and lead into further developments. An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several different concurrent narrative threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent to each other. Each episode may feature some of the show's current storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials and those that are broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends, there are several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger, and the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons) ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast.\n\nEvening soap operas and those that air at a rate of one episode per week are more likely to feature the entire cast in each episode, and to represent all current storylines in each episode. Evening soap operas and serials that run for only part of the year tend to bring things to a dramatic end-of-season cliffhanger.\n\nIn 1976, \"Time\" magazine described American daytime television as \"TV's richest market,\" noting the loyalty of the soap opera fan base and the expansion of several half-hour series into hour-long broadcasts in order to maximize ad revenues. The article explained that at that time, many prime time series lost money, while daytime serials earned profits several times more than their production costs. The issue's cover notably featured its first daytime soap stars, Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes of \"Days of Our Lives\", a married couple whose onscreen and real-life romance was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press at large.\n\nThe main characteristics that define soap operas are \"an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations\". Fitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family. The storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters. \"Soap narratives, like those of film melodramas, are marked by what Steve Neale has described as 'chance happenings, coincidences, missed meetings, sudden conversions, last-minute rescues and revelations, deus ex machina endings.'\" These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas, from \"EastEnders\" to \"Dallas\". Due to the prominence of English-language television, most soap-operas are completely English (or in the case of a foreign soap opera, dubbed into English). However, several South African soap operas started incorporating a multi-language format, the most prominent being 7de Laan, which incorporates Afrikaans, English, Zulu and several other Bantu languages which make up the 11 Official Languages of South Africa (the subtitles are always in English).\n\nIn many soap operas, in particular daytime serials in the US, the characters are frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy. Soap operas from the United Kingdom and Australia tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations, and are frequently set in working class environments. Many of the soaps produced in those two countries explore social realist storylines such as family discord, marriage breakdown or financial problems. Both UK and Australian soap operas feature comedic elements, often affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them. This diverges from US soap operas where such comedy is rare. UK soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting \"reality\" or purport to have a \"realistic\" style. UK soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location. As examples, \"EastEnders\" focuses on the tough and grim life in the east end of London; \"Coronation Street\" and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of \"northern straight talking\".\n\nRomance, secret relationships, extramarital affairs, and genuine hate have been the basis for many soap opera storylines. In US daytime serials, the most popular soap opera characters, and the most popular storylines, often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback romance novels. Soap opera storylines sometimes weave intricate, convoluted and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs, meet mysterious strangers and fall in love, and who commit adultery, all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story. Crimes such as kidnapping, rape, and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story.\n\nAustralian and UK soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines. In Russia, most popular serials explore the \"romantic quality\" of criminal and/or oligarch life.\n\nIn soap opera storylines, previously unknown children, siblings and twins (including the evil variety) of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series. Unexpected calamities disrupt weddings, childbirths, and other major life events with unusual frequency.\n\nAs in comic books – another popular form of linear storytelling pioneered in the US during the 20th century – a character's death is not guaranteed to be permanent. On \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", Taylor Forrester (Hunter Tylo) was shown to flatline and have a funeral. When Tylo reprised the character in 2005, a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.\n\nStunts and complex physical action are largely absent, especially from daytime serials. Such story events often take place off screen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown. This is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict visually without complex action, multiple takes, and post production editing. When episodes were broadcast live, post production work was impossible. Though all serials have long switched to being taped, extensive post production work and multiple takes, while possible, are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets.\n\nThe first daytime TV soap opera in the United States was \"These Are My Children\" in 1949, though earlier melodramas had aired in the evenings as once-a-week programs. Soap operas quickly became a fixture of American daytime television in the early 1950s, joined by game shows, sitcom reruns and talk shows.\n\nIn 1988, H. Wesley Kenney, who at the time served as the executive producer of \"General Hospital\", said to \"The New York Times\":\nMany long-running US soap operas established particular environments for their stories. \"The Doctors\" and \"General Hospital\", in the beginning, told stories almost exclusively from inside the confines of a hospital. \"As the World Turns\" dealt heavily with Chris Hughes' law practice and the travails of his wife Nancy who, tired of being \"the loyal housewife\" in the 1970s, became one of the first older women on the American serials to enter the workforce. \"Guiding Light\" dealt with Bert Bauer (Charita Bauer) and her alcoholic husband Bill, and their endless marital troubles. When Bert's status shifted to caring mother and town matriarch, her children's marital troubles were showcased. \"Search for Tomorrow\" mostly told its story through the eyes of Joanne Gardner (Mary Stuart). Even when stories revolved around other characters, Joanne was frequently a key player in their storylines. \"Days of Our Lives\" initially focused on Dr. Tom Horton and his steadfast wife Alice. The show later branched out to focus more on their five children. \"The Edge of Night\" featured as its central character Mike Karr, a police detective (later an attorney), and largely dealt with organized crime. \"The Young and the Restless\" first focused on two families, the prosperous Brooks family with four daughters, and the working class Foster family of a single working mother with three children. Its storylines explored realistic problems including cancer, mental illness, poverty, and infidelity.\n\nIn contrast, \"Dark Shadows\" (1966–1971) and \"Port Charles\" (1997–2003) featured supernatural characters and dealt with fantasy and horror storylines. Their characters included vampires, witches, ghosts, goblins, and angels.\n\nThe American soap opera \"Guiding Light\" (originally titled \"The Guiding Light\" until 1975) started as a radio drama in January 1937 and subsequently transferred to television in June 1952. With the exception of several years in the late 1940s, during which creator Irna Phillips was involved in a dispute with Procter & Gamble, \"Guiding Light\" was heard or seen nearly every weekday from 1937 until 2009, making it the longest story ever told in a broadcast medium.\n\nOriginally serials were broadcast as fifteen-minute installments each weekday in daytime slots. In 1956, \"As the World Turns\" and \"The Edge of Night\", both produced by Procter & Gamble Productions, debuted as the first half-hour soap operas on the CBS television network. All soap operas broadcast half-hour episodes by the end of the 1960s. With increased popularity in the 1970s, most soap operas had expanded to an hour in length by the end of the decade (\"Another World\" even expanded to 90 minutes for a short time). More than half of the serials had expanded to one-hour episodes by 1980. As of 2012, three of the four US serials air one-hour episodes each weekday; only \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" airs 30-minute episodes.\n\nSoap operas were originally broadcast live from the studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling similar to that of a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time in New York City, a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theatre during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as \"General Hospital\", \"Days of our Lives\" and \"The Young and the Restless\" were produced in Los Angeles. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. \"As the World Turns\" and \"The Edge of Night\" were the last to make the switch, in 1975.\n\n\"Port Charles\" used the practice of running 13-week \"story arcs,\" in which the main events of the arc are played out and wrapped up over the 13 weeks, although some storylines did continue over more than one arc. According to the 2006 Preview issue of \"Soap Opera Digest\", it was briefly discussed that all ABC shows might do telenovela arcs, but this was rejected.\n\nThough U.S. daytime soap operas are not generally rerun by their networks, occasionally they are rebroadcast elsewhere; CBS and ABC have made exceptions to this, airing older episodes (either those aired earlier in the current season or those aired years prior) on major holidays when special event programming is not scheduled. Early episodes of \"Dark Shadows\" were rerun on PBS member stations in the early 1970s after the show's cancellation, and the entire series (except for a single missing episode) was rerun on the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s. After \"The Edge of Night\"s 1984 cancellation, reruns of the show's final five years were shown late nights on USA Network from 1985 to 1989. On January 20, 2000, a digital cable and satellite network dedicated to the genre, SOAPnet, began re-airing soaps that originally aired on ABC, NBC and CBS.\n\nNewer broadcast networks since the late 1980s, such as Fox and cable television networks, have largely eschewed soap operas in their daytime schedules, instead running syndicated programming and reruns. No cable television outlet has produced its own daytime serial, although DirecTV's The 101 Network took over existing serial \"Passions\", continuing production for one season; while TBS and CBN Cable Network respectively aired their own soap operas, \"The Catlins\" (a primetime soap that utilized the daily episode format of its daytime counterparts) and \"Another Life\" (a soap that combined standard serial drama with religious overtones), during the 1980s. Fox, the fourth \"major network,\" carried a short lived daytime soap \"Tribes\" in 1990. Yet other than this and a couple of pilot attempts, Fox mainly stayed away from daytime soaps, and has not attempted them since their ascension to major-network status in 1994 (it did later attempt a series of daily prime time soaps, which aired on newly created sister network MyNetworkTV, but the experiment was largely a failure).\n\nDue to the masses of episodes produced for a series, release of soap operas to DVD (a popular venue for distribution of current and vintage television series) is considered impractical. With the exception of occasional specials, daytime soap operas are notable by their absence from DVD release schedules (an exception being the supernatural soap opera, \"Dark Shadows\", which did receive an essentially complete release on both VHS and DVD; the single lost episode #1219 is reconstructed by means of an off-the-air audio recording, still images, and recap material from adjacent episodes).\n\nDue to the longevity of these shows, it is not uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors. The key character of Mike Karr on \"The Edge of Night\" was played by three different actors.\n\nConversely, several actors have remained playing the same character for many years, or decades even. Helen Wagner played Hughes family matriarch Nancy Hughes on American soap \"As the World Turns\" from its April 2, 1956 debut through her death in May 2010. She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the actor with the longest uninterrupted performance in a single role. A number of performers played roles for twenty years or longer, occasionally on more than one show. Rachel Ames played Audrey Hardy on both \"General Hospital\" and \"Port Charles\" from 1964 until 2007, and returned in 2009. Susan Lucci played Erica Kane in \"All My Children\" from the show's debut in January 1970 until it ended its network television run on ABC on September 23, 2011. Erika Slezak played Victoria Lord #3 on \"One Life to Live\" from 1971 until the show ended its network television run on ABC on January 13, 2012 and resumed the role in its short-lived online revival on April 29, 2013.\n\nOther actors have played several characters on different shows. Millette Alexander, Bernard Barrow, Doris Belack, David Canary, Judith Chapman, Jordan Charney, Joan Copeland, Nicolas Coster, Jacqueline Courtney, Louis Edmonds, Dan Hamilton, Don Hastings, Vincent Irizarry, Lenore Kasdorf, Teri Keane, Lois Kibbee, John Loprieno, Maeve McGuire, James Mitchell, Christopher Pennock, Gary Pillar, Antony Ponzini, William Prince, Louise Shaffer, and Diana van der Vlis, among many others, have all played multiple soap roles.\n\nFor several decades, most daytime soap operas concentrated on family and marital discord, legal drama and romance. The action rarely left interior settings, and many shows were set in fictional, medium-sized Midwestern towns.\n\nExterior shots were slowly incorporated into the series \"The Edge of Night\" and \"Dark Shadows\". Unlike many earlier serials that were set in fictional towns, \"The Best of Everything\" and \"Ryan's Hope\" were set in a real-world location, New York City.\n\nThe first exotic location shoot was made by \"All My Children\", to St. Croix in 1978. Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after the success of the \"All My Children\" shoot. Soap operas \"Another World\" and \"Guiding Light\" both went to St. Croix in 1980, the former show culminating a long-running storyline between popular characters Mac, Rachel and Janice, and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for Alan Spaulding and Rita Bauer's torrid affair. \"Search for Tomorrow\" taped for two weeks in Hong Kong in 1981. Later that year, some of the cast and crew ventured to Jamaica to tape a love consummation storyline between the characters of Garth and Kathy.\n\nDuring the 1980s, perhaps as a reaction to the evening drama series that were gaining high ratings, daytime serials began to incorporate action and adventure storylines, more big-business intrigue, and an increased emphasis on youthful romance.\n\nOne of the first and most popular couples was Luke Spencer and Laura Webber on \"General Hospital\". Luke and Laura helped to attract both male and female fans. Even actress Elizabeth Taylor was a fan and at her own request was given a guest role in Luke and Laura's wedding episode. Luke and Laura's popularity led to other soap producers striving to reproduce this success by attempting to create supercouples of their own.\n\nWith increasingly bizarre action storylines coming into vogue, Luke and Laura saved the world from being frozen, brought a mobster down by finding his black book in a Left-Handed Boy Statue, and helped a Princess find her Aztec Treasure in Mexico. Other soap operas attempted similar adventure storylines, often featuring footage shot on location – frequently in exotic locales.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the mob, action and adventure stories fell out of favor with producers, due to generally declining ratings for daytime soap operas at the time, and the resultant budget cuts. In addition, soap operas were no longer able to go on expensive location shoots overseas as they were able to do in the 1980s. During that decade, soap operas increasingly focused on younger characters and social issues, such as Erica Kane's drug addiction on \"All My Children\", the re-emergence of Viki Lord's multiple personality disorder on \"One Life to Live\", and Stuart Chandler dealing with his wife Cindy dying of AIDS on \"All My Children\". Other social issues included cancer, rape, abortion, homophobia, and racism.\n\nSome shows during the 2000s incorporated supernatural and science fiction elements into their storylines. One of the main characters on the earlier soap opera \"Dark Shadows\" was Barnabas Collins, a vampire, and \"One Life to Live\" featured an angel named Virgil. Both shows featured characters who traveled to and from the past.\n\nModern U.S. daytime soap operas largely stay true to the original soap opera format. The duration and format of storylines and the visual grammar employed by U.S. daytime serials set them apart from soap operas in other countries and from evening soap operas. Stylistically, UK and Australian soap operas, which are usually produced for early evening timeslots, fall somewhere in between U.S. daytime and evening soap operas. Similar to U.S. daytime soap operas, UK and Australian serials are shot on videotape, and the cast and storylines are rotated across the week's episodes so that each cast member will appear in some but not all episodes. UK and Australian soap operas move through storylines at a faster rate than daytime serials, making them closer to U.S. evening soap operas in this regard.\n\nAmerican daytime soap operas feature stylistic elements that set them apart from other shows:\n\nSoap opera ratings have significantly fallen in the U.S. since the 2000s. No new major daytime soap opera has been created since \"Passions\" in 1999, while many have been cancelled. Since January 2012, four daytime soap operas – \"General Hospital\", \"Days of Our Lives\", \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" – continue to air on the three major networks, down from a total of 12 during the 1990–91 season and a high of 19 in the 1969–70 season. This marks the first time since 1953 that there have been only four soap operas airing on broadcast television. \"The Young and the Restless\", the highest-rated soap opera from 1988 to the present, had fewer than 5 million daily viewers as of February 2012, a number exceeded by several non-scripted programs such as \"Judge Judy\". Circulations of soap opera magazines have decreased and some have even ceased publication. SOAPnet, which largely aired soap opera reruns, began to be phased out in 2012 and fully ceased operations the following year. The Daytime Emmy Awards, which honor soap operas and other daytime shows, moved from primetime network television to smaller cable channels in 2012, then failed to get any TV broadcast at all in 2014, 2016, and 2017.\n\nSeveral of the U.S.’s most established soaps ended between 2009 and 2012. The longest-running drama in television and radio history, \"Guiding Light\", barely reached 2.1 million daily viewers in 2009 and ended on September 18 of that year, after a 72-year run. \"As the World Turns\" aired its final episode on September 17, 2010 after a 54-year run. \"As the World Turns\" was the last of 20 soap operas produced by Procter & Gamble, the soap and consumer goods company from which the genre got its name. \"As The World Turns\" and \"Guiding Light\" were also among the last of the soaps that originated from New York City. \"All My Children\", another New York-based soap, moved its production out to Los Angeles in an effort to reduce costs and raise sagging ratings; however, both it and \"One Life to Live\", each with a four-decade-plus run, were cancelled in 2011. \"All My Children\" aired its network finale in September 2011 with \"One Life to Live\" following suit in January 2012. Both \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" were briefly revived online in 2013, before being canceled again that same year.\n\nAs women increasingly worked outside of the home, daytime television viewing declined. New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows' long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. Now, as viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the demographic group that soap opera advertisers pay the most for. Those who might watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as Nielsen does not track television viewing outside the home. The rise of cable and the internet has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day. The genre's decline has additionally been attributed to reality television displacing soap operas as TV's dominant form of melodrama. An early term for the reality TV genre was \"docu-soap\". A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994–95 O. J. Simpson murder case, both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent fewer viewers after the trial ended.\n\nDaytime programming alternatives such as talk shows, game shows, and court shows cost up to 50% less to produce than scripted dramas, making those formats more profitable and attractive to networks, even if they receive the same or slightly lower ratings than soap operas. A network may even prefer to return a timeslot to its local stations to keeping a soap opera with disappointing ratings on the air, as was the case with \"Sunset Beach\" and \"Port Charles\". Compounding the financial pressure on scripted programming in the 2007–2010 period was a decline in advertising during the Great Recession, which led shows to reduce their budgets and cast sizes. In addition to these external factors, a litany of production decisions has been cited by soap opera fans as contributing to the genre's decline, such as cliched plots, a lack of diversity that narrowed audience appeal, and the elimination of core families.\n\nSerials produced for primetime slots have also found success. The first primetime soap opera was \"Faraway Hill\" (1946), which aired on October 2, 1946, on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network. \"Faraway Hill\" ran for 12 episodes and was primarily broadcast live, interspersed with short pre-recorded film clips and still photos to remind the audience of the previous week's episode.\n\nThe first long-running prime time soap opera was \"Peyton Place\" (1964–1969) on ABC. It was based in part on the eponymous 1957 film (which, in turn, was based on the 1956 novel).\n\nThe popularity of \"Peyton Place\" prompted the CBS network to spin-off popular \"As the World Turns\" character Lisa Miller into her own evening soap opera, \"Our Private World\" (originally titled \"The Woman Lisa\" in its planning stages). \"Our Private World\" was broadcast from May to September 1965. The character of Lisa (and her portrayer Eileen Fulton) returned to \"As The World Turns\" after the series ended.\n\nThe structure of \"Peyton Place\", with its episodic plots and long-running story arcs, set the mold for the primetime serials of the 1980s when the format reached its pinnacle.\n\nThe successful primetime serials of the 1980s included \"Dallas\", \"Dynasty\", \"Knots Landing\" and \"Falcon Crest\". These shows frequently dealt with wealthy families, and their personal and big-business travails. Common characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes, complex storylines examining business schemes and intrigue, and spectacular disaster cliffhanger situations. Each of these series featured a wealthy, domineering, promiscuous, and passionate antagonist as a key character in the storyline – respectively, J. R. Ewing, Alexis Colby, Abby Cunningham and Angela Channing. These villainous schemers became immensely popular figures that audiences \"loved to hate\".\n\nUnlike daytime serials, which are shot on video in a studio using the multi-camera setup, these evening series were shot on film using a single camera setup, and featured substantial location-shot footage, often in picturesque locales. \"Dallas\", its spin-off \"Knots Landing\", and \"Falcon Crest\" all initially featured episodes with self-contained stories and specific guest stars who appeared in just that episode. Each story was completely resolved by the end of the episode, and there were no end-of-episode cliffhangers. After the first couple of seasons, all three shows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera, with interwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes. \"Dynasty\" featured this format throughout its run.\n\nThe soap opera's distinctive open plot structure and complex continuity was increasingly incorporated into American primetime television programs of the period. The first significant drama series to do this was \"Hill Street Blues\". This series, produced by Steven Bochco, featured many elements borrowed from soap operas, such as an ensemble cast, multi-episode storylines, and extensive character development over the course of the series. It and the later \"Cagney & Lacey\" overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives exploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the regular characters. The success of these series prompted other drama series, such as \"St. Elsewhere\" and situation comedy series, to incorporate serialized stories and story structure to varying degrees.\n\nThe primetime soap operas and drama series of the 1990s, such as \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", \"Melrose Place\", \"Party of Five\", \"The OC\", and \"Dawson's Creek\", focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the primetime soap opera format with shows such as \"Desperate Housewives\", \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"Brothers & Sisters\", \"Ugly Betty\", \"Private Practice\", and more recently \"Revenge\", \"Nashville\", \"Scandal\", \"Mistresses\", and formerly \"Ringer\", which its sister production company ABC Studios co-produced with CBS Television Studios for The CW. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed with humor, and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC's launching serials, including \"Heroes\" and \"Friday Night Lights\". The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox, launched a line of primetime telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in 2007, after disappointing ratings.\n\nOn June 13, 2012, \"Dallas\", a continuation of the 1978 original series premiered on the cable network, TNT. The revived series, which was canceled after three seasons in 2014, delivered solid ratings for the channel, only losing viewership after the show's most established star, Larry Hagman, died midway through the series. In 2012, Nick at Nite debuted a primetime soap opera, \"Hollywood Heights\", which aired episodes five nights a week (on Monday through Fridays) in a manner similar to a daytime soap opera, instead of the once-a-week episode output common of other primetime soaps. The series, which was an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela \"Alcanzar una estrella\", suffered from low ratings (generally receiving less than one million viewers) and was later moved to sister cable channel TeenNick halfway through its run to burn off the remaining episodes.\n\nIn 2015, Fox debuted \"Empire\", a primetime musical serial centering on the power struggle between family members within the titular recording company. Created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong and led by Academy Award nominees Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, the drama premiered to high ratings. The show is strongly influenced by other works such as William Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", James Goldman's \"The Lion in Winter\" and the 1980s soap opera \"Dynasty\". Also in 2015, E! introduced \"The Royals\", a series following the life and drama of a fictional English Royal family, which was also inspired by \"Dynasty\" (even featuring Joan Collins as the Queen's mother). In addition, ABC debuted a primetime soap opera \"Blood & Oil\", following a young couple looking to make money off the modern-day Williston oil boom, premiering on September 27, 2015 during the 2015-16 TV season.\n\nThe telenovela, a shorter-form format of serial melodrama, shares some thematic and especially stylistic similarity to the soap opera, enough that the colloquialism \"Spanish soap opera\" has arisen to describe the format. The chief difference between the two is length of series; while soap operas usually have indefinite runs, telenovelas typically have a central story arc with a prescribed ending within a year or two of the show's launch, requiring more concise storytelling.\n\nSpanish-language networks, chiefly Univision and Telemundo, have found success airing telenovelas for the growing U.S. Hispanic market. Both originally produced and imported Latin American dramas are popular features of the networks' daytime and primetime lineups, sometimes beating English-language networks in the ratings.\n\nSome web series are soap operas, such as \"\" or \"\". In 2013, production company Prospect Park revived \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" for the web, retaining original creator Agnes Nixon as a consultant and keeping many of the same actors (Prospect Park purchased the rights to both series months after their cancellations by ABC in 2011, although it initially suspended plans to relaunch the soaps later that same year due to issues receiving approval from acting and production unions). Each show initially produced four half-hour episodes a week, but quickly cut back to two half-hour episodes each. In the midst of (though not directly related to) a lawsuit between Prospect Park and ABC, the experiment ended that same year, with both shows being canceled again.\n\nSoap operas in the UK began on radio and consequently were associated with the BBC. It had resisted soaps as antithetical to its quality image, but began broadcasting \"Front Line Family\" in April 1941 on its North American shortwave service to encourage American intervention on Britain's behalf in World War II. The BBC continues to broadcast the world's longest-running radio soap, \"The Archers\", which first aired in May 1950, and has been running nationally since 1951. It is currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and continues to attract over five million listeners, or roughly 25% of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening.\n\nIn the UK, soap operas are one of the most popular genres, with most being broadcast during prime time. Most UK soap operas focus on everyday, working-class communities, influenced by the conventions of the kitchen sink drama. The most popular British television programmes are \"EastEnders\", \"Coronation Street\", \"Emmerdale\", \"Hollyoaks\", \"Doctors\", and the Australian produced \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\". The first three of these are consistently among the highest-rated shows on British television. Such is the magnitude of the popularity of the soap genre in the UK that all television serials in the country are reputedly enjoyed by members of the British Royal Family, including Elizabeth II herself. Major events in British culture are often mentioned in the storyline, such as England’s participation at the World Cup, and the death of Princess Diana.\n\nThe 1986 Christmas Day episode of \"EastEnders\" is often referred to as the highest-rated UK soap opera episode ever, with 30.15 million viewers (more than half the population at the time). The figure of 30.15 million was actually a combination of the original broadcast, which had just over 19 million viewers, and the Sunday omnibus edition with 10 million viewers. The combined 30.15 million audience figure makes the aforementioned Christmas Day 1986 episode of \"EastEnders\" the highest-rated single-channel broadcast in the history of UK television. Overall it ranks third behind the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final (32.3 million viewers) and Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 (32.1 million viewers) which were transmitted on both BBC One and ITV.\n\nAn early television serial was \"The Grove Family\" on the BBC, which produced 148 episodes from 1954 to 1957. The programme was broadcast live and only a handful of recordings were retained in the archives. The UK's first twice-weekly serial was ITV's \"Emergency - Ward 10\", running from 1957 until 1967.\n\nIn the 1960s \"Coronation Street\" revolutionised UK television and quickly became a British institution. On 17 September 2010, it became the world's longest-running television soap opera and was listed in \"Guinness World Records\". The BBC also produced several serials: \"Compact\" was about the staff of a women's magazine; \"The Newcomers\" was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town; \"United!\" contained 147 episodes and focused on a football team; \"199 Park Lane\" (1965) was an upper class serial, which ran for only 18 episodes. None of these serials came close to making the same impact as \"Coronation Street\". Indeed, most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely wiped.\n\nDuring the 1960s, \"Coronation Street\"s main rival was \"Crossroads\", a daily serial that began in 1964 and aired on ITV in the early evening. \"Crossroads\" was set in a Birmingham motel and, although the program was popular, its purported low technical standard and bad acting were much mocked. By the 1980s, its ratings had begun to decline. Several attempts to revamp the program through cast changes and, later, expanding the focus from the motel to the surrounding community were unsuccessful. \"Crossroads\" was cancelled in 1988 (a new version of \"Crossroads\" was later produced, running from 2001 until 2003).\n\nA later rival to \"Coronation Street\" was ITV's \"Emmerdale Farm\" (later renamed \"Emmerdale\"), which began in 1972 in a daytime slot and was set in rural Yorkshire. Increased viewership resulted in \"Emmerdale\" being moved to a prime-time slot in the 1980s.\n\n\"Pobol y Cwm\" (\"People of the Valley\") is a Welsh language serial that has been produced by the BBC since October 1974, and is the longest-running television soap opera produced by the broadcaster. \"Pobol y Cwm\" was originally broadcast on BBC Wales television from 1974 to 1982; it was then moved to the Welsh-language television station S4C when it opened in November 1982. The program was occasionally shown on BBC1 in London during periods of regional optout in the mid- to late 1970s. \"Pobol y Cwm\" was briefly shown in the rest of the UK in 1994 on BBC2, with English subtitles; it is consistently the most watched programme each week on S4C.\n\nDaytime soap operas were non-existent until the 1970s because there was virtually no daytime television in the UK. ITV introduced \"General Hospital\", which later moved to a prime time slot. In 1980, Scottish Television debuted \"Take the High Road\", which lasted for over twenty years. Later, daytime slots were filled with an influx of Australian soap operas such as \"The Sullivans\" (aired on ITV from 1977), \"The Young Doctors\" (from 1982), \"Sons and Daughters\" (from 1983), \"A Country Practice\" (from 1982), \"Richmond Hill\" (from 1988 to 1989) and eventually, \"Neighbours\" was acquired by the BBC in 1986, and \"Home and Away\" aired on ITV beginning in 1989. These achieved significant levels of popularity; \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" were moved to early-evening slots, helping begin the UK soap opera boom in the late 1980s.\n\nThe day Channel 4 began operations in 1982 it launched its own soap, the Liverpool-based \"Brookside\", which would redefine soaps over the next decade. The focus of \"Brookside\" was different from earlier soap operas in the UK; it was set in a middle-class new-build cul-de-sac, unlike \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale Farm\", which were set in established working-class communities. The characters in \"Brookside\" were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner-city council estates, or the upper middle-class who had fallen on hard times. Though \"Brookside\" was still broadcast in a pre-watershed slot (8.00 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on weekdays, around 5.00 p.m. for the omnibus on Saturdays), it was more liberal than other soaps of the time: the dialogue regularly included expletives. This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel during that period. The soap was also heavily politicised. Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson), a militant trade-unionist anti-hero, was the most overtly political character. Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps (throughout the soap's history, there were two armed sieges on the street) and were staged with more violence (particularly, rape) often being featured.\n\nIn 1985, the BBC's \"EastEnders\" debuted and became a near instant success with viewers and critics alike, with the first episode attracting over 17 million viewers. The Christmas Day 1986 episode was watched by 30.15 million viewers and contained a scene in which divorce papers were served to Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) by her husband, Queen Vic landlord Den (Leslie Grantham).\n\nA notable success in pioneering late-night broadcasting, in October 1984, Yorkshire Television began airing the cult Australian soap opera \"Prisoner\", which originally ran from 1979 to 1986. It was eventually broadcast on all regions of the UK in differing slots, usually around 23:00 (but never before 22:30 in any region), under the title \"Prisoner: Cell Block H\". It was probably most popular in the Midlands where Central Television consistently broadcast the serial three times a week from 1987 to 1991. Its airing in the UK was staggered, so different regions of the country saw it at a different pace. The program was immensely successful, regularly achieving 10 million viewers when all regions' ratings per episode were added together. Central bowed to fan pressure to repeat the soap, of which the first 95 episodes aired. Then, rival station Channel 5 also acquired rights to repeat the entire rerun of the program, starting in 1997. All 692 episodes have since been released on DVD in the UK.\n\nIn 1992, the BBC made \"Eldorado\" to daily alternate with \"EastEnders\". The programme was heavily criticised and only lasted one year. Nevertheless, soap operas gained increasing prominence on UK television schedules. In 1995, Channel 4 premiered \"Hollyoaks\", a soap with a youth focus. When Channel 5 launched in March 1997, it debuted the soap opera \"Family Affairs\", which was formatted as a week-daily soap, airing Monday through Fridays.\n\n\"Brookside\"s premise evolved during the 1990s, phasing out the politicised stories of the 1980s and shifting the emphasis to controversial and sensationalist stories such as child rape, sibling incest, religious cults and drug addiction, including the infamous 'body under the patio' storyline that ran from 1993 to 1995, and gave the serial its highest ratings ever with 9 million viewers.\n\n\"Coronation Street\" and \"Brookside\" began releasing straight-to-video features. The \"Coronation Street\" releases generally kept the pace and style of conventional programs episodes with the action set in foreign locations. The \"Brookside\" releases were set in the usual locations, but featured stories with adult content not allowed on television pre-watershed, with these releases given '18' certificates.\n\n\"Emmerdale Farm\" was renamed \"Emmerdale\" in 1989. The series was revamped in 1993 with many changes executed via the crash of a passenger jet that partially destroyed the village and killed several characters. This attracted criticism as it was broadcast near the fifth anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing. The storyline drew the soap its highest ever audience of 18 million viewers. The revamp was a success and \"Emmerdale\" grew in popularity.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, \"Brookside\", \"Coronation Street\", \"EastEnders\" and \"Emmerdale\" continued to flourish. Each increased the number of episodes that aired on a weekly basis by at least one, further defining soap operas as the leading genre in British television.\n\nSince 2000, new soap operas have continued to be developed. Daytime drama \"Doctors\" began in March 2000, preceding \"Neighbours\" on BBC One. In 2002, as ratings for the Scottish serial \"High Road\" (formerly \"Take The High Road\") continued to decline, BBC Scotland launched \"River City\", which proved popular and effectively replaced \"High Road\" when it was cancelled in 2003. The long-running serial \"Brookside\" ended in November 2003 after 21 years on the air, leaving \"Hollyoaks\" as Channel 4's flagship serial.\n\nA new version of \"Crossroads\" featuring a mostly new cast was produced by Carlton Television for ITV in 2001. It did not achieve high ratings and was cancelled in 2003. In 2001, ITV also launched a new early-evening serial entitled \"Night and Day\". This program too attracted low viewership and, after being shifted to a late night time slot, was cancelled in 2003. \"Family Affairs\", which was broadcast opposite the racier \"Hollyoaks\", never achieved significantly high ratings leading to several dramatic casting revamps and marked changes in style and even location over its run. By 2004, \"Family Affairs\" had a larger fan base and won its first awards, but was cancelled in late 2005.\n\nIn 2008, ITV premiered \"The Royal Today\", a daily spin-off of popular 1960s-based drama \"The Royal\", which had been running in a primetime slot since 2002. Just days later, soap opera parody programs \"Echo Beach\" premiered alongside its sister show, the comedy \"Moving Wallpaper\". Both \"Echo Beach\" and \"The Royal Today\" ended after just one series due to low ratings. Radio soap opera \"Silver Street\" debuted on the BBC Asian Network in 2004. Poor ratings and criticism of the program led to its cancellation in 2010.\n\nUK soap operas for many years usually only aired two nights a week. The exception was the original \"Crossroads\", which began as a weekdaily soap opera in the 1960s, but later had its number of weekly broadcasts reduced. Things started to change in 1989 when \"Coronation Street\" began airing three times a week. In 1996, it expanded again, to air four episodes a week. \"Brookside\" premiered in 1982 with two episodes a week. In 1990, it expanded to three episodes a week; the trend was followed by \"EastEnders\" in 1994 and \"Emmerdale\" in 1997, In 2000, the soap went five episodes a week. \"Family Affairs\" debuted as a weekdaily soap in 1997, producing five episodes a week throughout its entire run. The imported \"Neighbours\" screens as five new episodes a week, which are shown once at 1:45 p.m. and repeated at 5:30 p.m. on Channel 5 each weekday.\n\nCurrently, \"Coronation Street\" (which began airing two episodes on Monday nights in 2002) and \"Hollyoaks\" both produce five episodes a week, while \"EastEnders\" produces four each week. In 2002, \"Brookside\" expanded from three half-hour episodes on different weeknights to airing one 90-minute episode each week. In 2004, \"Emmerdale\" began airing six episodes a week. \"Doctors\" airs five episodes a week, and is the only soap without a weekend omnibus repeat screening. It was announced in June 2016 that starting late 2017, Coronation Street would air six episodes a week.\n\nDue to a January 2008 overhaul of the ITV network, the Sunday episodes of \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\" were moved out of their slots. \"Coronation Street\" added a second episode on Friday evenings at 8:30 p.m. \"Emmerdale\"s Tuesday edition was extended to an hour, putting it in direct competition with rival \"EastEnders\".\n\nIn July 2009, the schedules of these serials were changed again. On 23 July 2009, \"Coronation Street\" moved from the Wednesday slot it held for 49 years, to Thursday evenings. \"Emmerdale\" reverted to running just one 30-minute episode on Tuesday evenings and the other 30-minute installment was moved to Thursday evenings. Coronation Street has since returned to a Wednesday slot. It now airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 19:30 and 20:30. Emmerdale airs at 19:00 every weeknight, and 20:00 on Thursdays.\n\nUK soap operas are shot on videotape in the studio using a multi-camera setup. Since the 1980s, these programs routinely feature scenes shot outdoors in each episode. This footage is shot on videotape on a purpose-built outdoor set that represents the community that the soap focuses on. During their early years, \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\" used 16 mm film while scenes were shot on location. Later soap operas such as \"Hollyoaks\" and \"Family Affairs\" started filming on high-definition video, a more modern filming process, as opposed to standard videotape, which features better quality and appears to look more like film than videotape.\n\nUK soap operas do not incorporate recap sequences at the beginning of each episode, which would be appropriate for the fact that when an episode ends, it picks up the story during the following episode. However, in 2012, \"Hollyoaks\" began airing a recap sequence at the beginning of each episode. With the exception of \"Hollyoaks\", soap operas in the UK also lack incidental music, although \"EastEnders\" would sometimes feature music that plays over an ending scene if it was dramatic, with an alternative \"EastEnders\" theme known as \"Julia's theme\".\n\nAustralia has had quite a number of well-known soap operas, some of which have gained cult followings in the UK, New Zealand and other countries. The majority of Australian television soap operas are produced for early evening or evening timeslots. They usually produce two or two-and-a-half hours of new material each week, either arranged as four or five half-hour episodes a week, or as two one-hour episodes. Stylistically, these series most closely resemble UK soap operas in that they are nearly always shot on videotape, are mainly recorded in a studio and use a multi-camera setup. The original Australian serials were shot entirely in-studio. During the 1970s occasional filmed inserts were used to incorporate sequences shot outdoors. Outdoor shooting later became commonplace and starting in the late 1970s, it became standard practice for some on-location footage to be featured in each episode of any Australian soap opera, often to capitalise on the attractiveness and exotic nature of these locations for international audiences. Most Australian soap operas focus on a mixed age range of middle-class characters and will regularly feature a range of locations where the various, disparate characters can meet and interact, such as the café, the surf club, the wine bar or the school.\n\nThe genre began in Australia on radio, as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom. One such radio serial, \"Big Sister\", featured actress Thelma Scott in the cast and aired nationally for five years beginning in 1942. Probably the best known Australian radio serial was the long-running soap opera \"Blue Hills\", which was created by Gwen Meredith and ran from 1949 to 1976. With the advent of Australian television in 1956, daytime television serials followed. The first Australian television soap opera was \"Autumn Affair\" (1958) featuring radio personality and \"Blue Hills\" star Queenie Ashton making the transition to television. Each episode of this serial ran for 15 minutes and aired each weekday on the Seven Network. \"Autumn Affair\" failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after 156 episodes. It was followed by \"The Story of Peter Grey\" (1961), another Seven Network weekday series aired in a daytime slot in 15-minute installments. \"The Story of Peter Grey\" ran for 164 episodes.\n\nThe first successful wave of Australian evening television soap operas started in 1967 with \"Bellbird\", produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This rural-based serial screened in an early evening slot in 15-minute installments as a lead-in to the evening news. \"Bellbird\" was a moderate success but built-up a consistent and loyal viewer base, especially in rural areas, and enjoyed a ten-year run. \"Motel\" (1968) was Australia's first half-hour soap opera; the daytime soap had a short run of 132 episodes.\n\nThe first major soap opera hit in Australia was the sex-melodrama \"Number 96\", a nighttime series produced by Cash Harmon Television for Network Ten, which debuted March 1972. The program dealt with such topics as homosexuality, adultery, drug use, rape-within-marriage and racism, which had rarely been explored on Australian television programs before. The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedic characters, many of whom became cult heroes in Australia. By 1973, \"Number 96\" had become Australia's highest-rated show. In 1974, the sexed-up antics of \"Number 96\" prompted the creation of \"The Box\", which rivaled it in terms of nudity and sexual situations and was scheduled in a nighttime slot. Produced by Crawford Productions, many critics considered \"The Box\" to be a more slickly produced and better written show than \"Number 96\". \"The Box\" also aired on the Ten Network, programmed to run right after \"Number 96\". For 1974 \"Number 96\" was again the highest rating show on Australian television, and that year \"The Box\" occupied the number two spot.\n\nAlso in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created its first soap opera, and significantly Australia's first \"teen\" soap opera, \"Class of '74\". With its attempts to hint at the sex and sin shown more openly on \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", its high school setting and early evening timeslot, \"Class of '74\" came under intense scrutiny from the Broadcasting Control Board, who vetted scripts and altered entire storylines.\n\nBy 1975, both \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", perhaps as a reaction to declining ratings for both shows, de-emphasised the sex and nudity shifting more towards comedic plots. \"Class of '74\" was renamed \"Class of '75\" and also added more slapstick comedy for its second year, but the revamped show's ratings declined, resulting in its cancellation in mid-1975. That year Cash Harmon's newly launched second soap \"The Unisexers\" failed in its early evening slot and was cancelled after three weeks; the Reg Grundy Organisation's second soap \"Until Tomorrow\" ran in a daytime slot for 180 episodes.\n\nA feature film version of \"Bellbird\" entitled \"Country Town\" was produced in 1971 by two of the show's stars, Gary Gray and Terry McDermott, without production involvement by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\" also released feature film versions, both of which had the same title as the series, released in 1974 and 1975 respectively. As Australian television had broadcast in black and white until 1975, these theatrical releases all had the novelty of being in colour. The film versions of \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\" also allowed more explicit nudity than could be shown on television at that time.\n\nIn November 1976 \"The Young Doctors\" debuted on the Nine Network. This Grundy Organization series eschewed the adult drama of \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", focusing more on relationship drama and romance. It became a popular success but received few critical accolades. A week later \"The Sullivans\", a carefully produced period serial chronicling the effects of World War II on a Melbourne family, also debuted on Nine. Produced by Crawford Productions, \"The Sullivans\" became a ratings success, attracted many positive reviews, and won television awards. During this period \"Number 96\" re-introduced nudity into its episodes, with several much-publicised full-frontal nude scenes, a cast revamp and a new range of shock storylines designed to boost the show's declining ratings. \"Bellbird\" experienced changes to its broadcast pattern with episodes screening in 60 minute blocks, and later in 30 minute installments.\n\"Bellbird\", \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", which had been experiencing declining ratings, were cancelled in 1977. Various attempts to revamp each of the shows with cast reshuffles or spectacular disaster storylines had proved only temporarily successful. \"The Young Doctors\" and \"The Sullivans\" continued to be popular. November 1977 saw the launch of successful soap opera/police procedural series \"Cop Shop\" (1977–1984) produced by Crawford Productions for Channel Seven. In early December 1977 Channel Ten debuted the Reg Grundy Organisation produced \"The Restless Years\" (1977–1981), a more standard soap drama focusing on several young school leavers.\n\nThe Seven Network, achieving success with \"Cop Shop\" produced by Crawford Productions, had Crawfords produce \"Skyways\", a series with a similar format but set in an airport, to compete with the Nine Network's popular talk show \"The Don Lane Show\". \"Skyways\", which debuted in July 1979, emphasised adult situations including homosexuality, marriage problems, adultery, prostitution, drug use and smuggling, crime, suicide, political intrigue, and murder, and featured some nudity. Despite this, the program achieved only moderate ratings and was cancelled in mid-1981.\n\nThe Reg Grundy Organisation found major success with the women's-prison drama \"Prisoner\" (1979–1986) on Network Ten, and melodramatic family saga \"Sons and Daughters\" (1982–1987) on the Seven Network. Both shows achieved high ratings in their original runs, and unusually, found success in repeats after the programs ended.\n\nGrundy soap \"The Young Doctors\" and Crawford Productions' \"The Sullivans\" continued on the Nine Network until late 1982. Thereafter Nine attempted many new replacement soap operas produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation: \"Taurus Rising\" (1982), \"Waterloo Station\" (1983), \"Starting Out\" (1983) and \"Possession\" (1985), along with \"Prime Time\" (1986) produced by Crawford Productions. None of these programs were successful and most were cancelled after only a few months. The Reg Grundy Organisation also created \"Neighbours\", a suburban-based daily serial devised as a sedate family drama with some comedic and lightweight situations, for the Seven Network in 1985.\n\nProduced in Melbourne at the studios of HSV-7, \"Neighbours\" achieved high ratings in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, but not in Sydney, where it aired at 5.30 p.m. placing it against the hit dating game show \"Perfect Match\" on Channel 10. The Seven Network's Sydney station ATN-7 quickly lost interest in \"Neighbours\" as a result of the low ratings in Sydney. HSV-7 in Melbourne lobbied heavily to keep \"Neighbours\" on the air, but ATN-7 managed to convince the rest of the network to cancel the show and instead keep ATN-7's own Sydney-based dramas \"A Country Practice\" and \"Sons and Daughters\".\n\nAfter the network cancelled \"Neighbours\", it was immediately picked up by Channel Ten, which revamped the cast and scripts slightly and aired the series in the 7.00 p.m. slot starting 20 January 1986. It initially attracted low audiences, however after a concerted publicity drive, Ten managed to transform the series into a major success, turning several of its actors into major international stars. The show's popularity eventually declined and it was moved to the 6.30 p.m. slot in 1992. As of 2015 the series airs on Eleven and is Australia's longest-running soap opera.\n\nThe success of \"Neighbours\" in the 1980s prompted the creation of somewhat similar suburban and family or teen-oriented soap operas such as \"Home and Away\" (1988–present) on Channel Seven and \"Richmond Hill\" (1988) on Channel Ten. Both proved popular, however \"Richmond Hill\" emerged as only a moderate success and was cancelled after one year to be replaced on Ten by \"E Street\" (1989–1993).\n\nNine continued trying to establish a successful new soap opera, without success. After the failure of family drama \"Family and Friends\" in 1990, it launched the raunchier and more extreme \"Chances\" in 1991, which resurrected the sex and melodrama of \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\" in an attempt to attract attention. \"Chances\" achieved only moderate ratings, and was moved to a late-night timeslot. It underwent several revamps that removed much of the original cast, and refocused the storylines to incorporate science-fiction and fantasy elements. The series continued in a late night slot until 1992, when it was cancelled due to low ratings despite the much-discussed fantasy storylines.\n\nSeveral Australian soap operas have also found significant international success. In the UK, starting in the mid-1980s, daytime broadcasts of \"The Young Doctors\", \"The Sullivans\", \"Sons and Daughters\" and \"Neighbours\" (which itself was subsequently moved to an early-evening slot) achieved significant success. Grundy's \"Prisoner\" began airing in the United States in 1979 and achieved high ratings in many regions there, however the show ended its run in that country three years into its run. \"Prisoner\" also aired in late-night timeslots in the UK beginning in the late 1980s, achieving enduring cult success there. The show became so popular in that country that it prompted the creation of two stage plays and a stage musical based on the show, all of which toured the UK, among many other spin-offs. In the late 1990s, Channel 5 repeated \"Prisoner\" in the UK. Between 1998 and 2005, Channel 5 ran late-night repeats of \"Sons and Daughters\". During the 1980s, the Australian attempts to emulate big-budget U.S. soap operas such as \"Dallas\" and \"Dynasty\" had resulted in the debuts of \"Taurus Rising\" and \"Return to Eden\", two slick soap opera dramas with big budgets that were shot entirely on film. Though their middling Australian ratings resulted in the shows running only for a single season, both programs were successfully sold internationally.\n\nOther shows to achieve varying levels of international success include \"Richmond Hill\", \"E Street\", \"Paradise Beach\" (1993–1994), and \"Pacific Drive\" (1995–1997). Indeed, these last two series were designed specifically for international distribution. Channel Seven's \"Home and Away\", a teen soap developed as a rival to \"Neighbours\", has also achieved significant and enduring success on UK television.\n\n\"Something in the Air\", a serial examining a range of characters in a small country town ran on the ABC from 2000 to 2002.\n\nAttempts to replicate the success of daily teen-oriented serials \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" saw the creation of \"Echo Point\" (1995) and \"Breakers\" (1999) on Network Ten. These programs foregrounded youthful attractive casts and appealing locations but the programs were not long-running successes and \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" remained the most visible and consistently successful Australian soap operas in production. In their home country, they both attracted respectable although not spectacular ratings in the early 2000s. By 2004, \"Neighbours\" was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode – considered at that time a low figure for Australian prime time television. By March 2007, the Australian audience for \"Neighbours\" had fallen to fewer than 700,000 a night. This prompted a revamp of the show's cast, its visual presentation, and a move away from the recently added action-oriented emphasis to refocus the show on the domestic storylines it is traditionally known for. During this period \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" continued to achieve significant ratings in the UK. This and other lucrative overseas markets, along with Australian broadcasting laws that enforce a minimum amount of domestic drama production on commercial television networks, help ensure that both programs remain in production. Both shows get higher total ratings in the UK than in Australia (the UK has three times the total population of Australia) and the UK channels make a major contribution to the production costs.\n\nIt has been suggested that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters. The casts of \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and glamour of the U.S. daytime serial, a middle-ground in which they have found their lucrative niche.\n\n\"Neighbours\" was carried in the United States on the Oxygen cable channel in March 2004; however it attracted few viewers, perhaps in part due to its scheduling opposite well-established and highly popular U.S. soap operas such as \"All My Children\" and \"The Young and the Restless\", and was dropped by the network shortly afterwards due to low ratings.\n\n\"headLand\" made its debut on Channel Seven in November 2005, the series arose out of a proposed spinoff of \"Home and Away\" that was to have been produced in conjunction with \"Home and Away\"s UK broadcaster, Five. The idea for the spin-off was scuttled after Five pulled out of the deal, which meant that the show could potentially air on a rival channel in the UK; as such, Five requested that the new show be developed as a standalone series and not be spun off from a series that it owned a stake in. The series premiered in Australia on November 15, 2005, but was not a ratings success and was cancelled two months later on January 23, 2006. The series broadcast on E4 and Channel 4 in the UK. Nickelodeon's \"\" appeared on July 2006 on Network Ten. Since Connie considered this mention as a torrid soap opera, this was mentioned in the Steven Universe episode \"Love Letters\".\n\nAfter losing the UK television rights to \"Neighbours\" to Five, the BBC commissioned a replacement serial \"Out of the Blue\", which was produced in Australia. It debuted as part of BBC One's weekday afternoon schedule on 28 April 2008 but low ratings prompted its move to BBC Two on 19 May 2008. The series was cancelled after its first season.\n\n\"Neighbours\"' continued low ratings in Australia resulted in it being moved to Ten's new digital channel, Eleven on January 11, 2011. However, it continues to achieve reasonable ratings on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, and as of March 2013 still reportedly achieved significant international sales.\n\nPioneering series \"Pukemanu\" aired over two years (1971–72) and was the NZBC's first continuing drama. It followed the goings-on of a North Island timber town.\n\"Close to Home\" is a New Zealand television soap opera that ran on Television One (Formally NZBC, later becoming Television New Zealand) from 1975 to 1983. At its peak in 1977 nearly one million viewers tuned in twice weekly to watch the series co-created by Michael Noonan and Tony Isaac (who had initially only agreed to make the show on the condition they would get to make \"The Governor\"). \"Gloss\" is a television drama series that screened from 1987 to 1990. The series is about a fictional publishing empire run by the Redfern family. Gloss was NZ's answer to US soap \"Dynasty\", with the Carrington oil scions replaced by the wealthy Redferns and their Auckland magazine empire. It was a starting point for many actors who went on to many productions in New Zealand, Australia and around the world including Temuera Morrison, Miranda Harcourt, Peter Elliott, Lisa Chappell, Danielle Cormack and Kevin Smith. Many of them would go on to star in \"Shortland Street\", which has been New Zealand's most popular soap since its debut in 1992. It airs on TVNZ 2.\n\nRadio New Zealand began airing its first radio soap \"You Me Now\" in September 2010. It is available for podcast on its website.\n\nRelatively few daily soap operas have been produced on English Canadian television, with most Canadian stations and networks that carry soap operas airing those imported from the United States or the United Kingdom. Notable daily soaps that did exist included \"Family Passions\", \"Scarlett Hill\", \"Strange Paradise\", \"Metropia\", \"Train 48\" and the international co-production \"Foreign Affairs\". \"Family Passions\" was an hour-long program, as is typical of American daytime soaps; all of the others ran half-hour episodes. Unlike American or British soap operas, the most influential of which have run for years or even decades, even daily Canadian soap operas have run for a few seasons at most. Short-run soaps, including \"49th & Main\" and \"North/South\", have also aired. Many of these were produced in an effort to comply with Canadian content regulations, which require a percentage of programming on Canadian television to originate from Canada.\n\nNotable prime time soap operas in Canada have included \"Riverdale\", \"House of Pride\", \"Paradise Falls\", \"Lance et Compte\" (\"He Shoots, He Scores\"), \"Loving Friends and Perfect Couples\" and \"The City\". The \"Degrassi\" franchise of youth dramas also incorporated some elements of the soap opera format.\n\nOn French-language television in Quebec, the \"téléroman\" has been a popular mainstay of network programming since the 1950s. Notable téléromans have included \"Rue des Pignons\", \"Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut\", \"Diva\", \"La famille Plouffe\", and the soap opera parody \"Le Cœur a ses raisons\".\n\nUnlike the season based production in most countries, most of Indian television fiction tends to be regular-broadcasting soap opera. These started in the late 1990s, as more and more people began to purchase television sets. At the beginning of the 21st century, soap operas became an integral part of Indian culture. Indian soap operas mostly concentrate on the conflict between love and arranged marriages occurring in India, and many includes family melodrama. Indian soap operas have multilingual production.\n\nMany soap operas produced in India are also broadcast overseas in the UK, Canada, the United States, and some parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and South East Asia. They are often mass-produced under large production banners, with companies like Balaji Telefilms running different language versions of the same serial on different television networks or channels.\n\nThe Australian serial \"The Restless Years\" was remade in the Netherlands as \"Goede tijden, slechte tijden\" (which debuted in 1990) and in Germany as \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\" (which has aired since 1992): both titles translate to \"good times, bad times\". These remakes are still airing, but have long since diverged from the original Australian storylines. The two shows are the highest-rated soap operas in their respective countries.\n\nA later Australian serial, \"Sons and Daughters\", has inspired five remakes produced under license from the original producers and based, initially, on original story and character outlines. These are \"Verbotene Liebe\" (Germany, 1995–2015); \"Skilda världar\" (Sweden, 1996–2002); \"Apagorevmeni agapi\" (Greece, 1998); \"Cuori Rubati\" (Italy, 2002–2003) and \"Zabranjena ljubav\" (Croatia, 2004–2008). Both \"The Restless Years\" and \"Sons and Daughters\" were created and produced in Australia by the Reg Grundy Organisation.\n\nThe Norwegian soap opera \"Hotel Cæsar\" aired on TV 2 from 1998 to 2017, and is the longest-running television drama in Scandinavia. Popular foreign soaps in the country include \"Days of Our Lives\" (broadcast on TV6 (Norway), \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" (TNT (Norway) and \"Home and Away\" (TV 2), all of which are subtitled.\n\nSerials have included \"Goede tijden, slechte tijden\" (1990–present), \"Onderweg naar Morgen\" (1994–2010) and \"Goudkust\" (1996–2001). In 2016 \"Goede tijden, slechte tijden\" spin-off \"Nieuwe Tijden\" started airing. U.S. daytime serials \"As The World Turns\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" have aired in the Netherlands; \"As the World Turns\" began airing in the country in 1990, with Dutch subtitles.\n\nIn the 1980s, West German networks successfully added American daytime and primetime soap operas to their schedule before Das Erste introduced its first self-produced weekly soap with \"Lindenstraße\", which was seen as a German counterpart to \"Coronation Street\". Like in other countries, the soap opera met with negative reviews, but eventually proved critics wrong with nearly 13 million viewers tuning in each week. Even though the format proved successful, it was not until 1992 before \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\" became the first German daily soap opera. Early ratings were bad as were the reviews, but the RTL network was willing to give its first soap opera a chance; ratings would improve, climbing to 7 million viewers by 2002. Not long after \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\", Das Erste introduced \"Marienhof\", which aired twice a week.\n\nAfter successfully creating the first German daily soap, production company Grundy Ufa wanted to produce another soap for RTL. Like \"GZSZ\", the format was based on an Australian soap opera from Reg Watson. But RTL did not like the plot idea about separated twins who meet each other for the first time after 20 years and fall in love without knowing that they are related. The project was then taken to Das Erste, which commissioned the program, titled \"Verbotene Liebe\", which premiered on January 2, 1995. With the premiere of \"Verbotene Liebe\", the network turned \"Marienhof\" into a daily soap as well. In the meanwhile, RTL debuted the Grundy Ufa-produced \"Unter uns\" in late 1994.\n\nZDF started a business venture with Canada and co-produced the short-lived series \"Family Passions\", starring actors such as Gordon Thomson, Roscoe Born, Dietmar Schönherr and a young Hayden Christensen. The daytime serial premiered on December 5, 1994, lasting 130 episodes. After its cancellation, the network debuted \"Jede Menge Leben\". Even after a crossover with three soaps, \"Freunde fürs Leben\", \"Forsthaus Falkenau\" and \"Unser Lehrer Doktor Specht\", the soap was canceled after 313 episodes. Sat.1 tried to get into the soap business as well, after successfully airing the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\", which was dropped in 1995 due to the talk show phenomenon that took over most of the daytime schedules of German networks. The network first tried to tell a family saga with \"So ist das Leben – die Wagenfelds\", before failing with \"Geliebte Schwestern\". RTL II made its own short-lived attempt with \"Alle zusammen - jeder für sich\".\n\nThe teen soap opera \"Schloss Einstein\" debuted on September 4, 1998, focusing on the life of a group of teenagers at the fictional titular boarding school near Berlin. As of July 2014, the series has produced over 815 episodes during the course of 17 seasons, a milestone in German television programming, and was renewed for an 18th season to debut in 2015.\n\nIn 1999, after the lasting success of \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\", \"Marienhof\", \"Unter uns\" and \"Verbotene Liebe\", ProSieben aired \"Mallorca – Suche nach dem Paradies\", set on the Spanish island with the same name. After nine months, the network canceled the program due to low viewership and high production costs. Even though ratings had improved, the show ended its run in a morning timeslot. The soap opera became something of a cult classic, as its 200-episode run was repeated several times on free-to-air and pay television.\n\nIn 2006, \"Alles was zählt\" became the last successful daily soap to make its debut, airing as a lead-in to \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\" and also produced by Grundy Ufa. Since Germany started to produce its own telenovelas, all soap operas faced declines in ratings. \"Unter uns\" was in danger of cancellation in 2009, but escaped such a fate due to budget cuts imposed by the show's producers and the firing of original cast member Holger Franke, whose firing and the death of his character outraged fans, resulting in a ratings spike in early 2010. After \"Unter uns\" was saved, Das Erste planned to make changes to its soap lineup. \"Marienhof\" had to deal with multiple issues in its storytelling, as well as in producing a successful half-hour show. Several changes were made within months, however \"Marienhof\" was canceled in June 2011. \"Verbotene Liebe\" was in danger of being cancelled as well, but convinced the network to renew it with changes that it made in both 2010 and 2011; the soap was later expanded to 45 minutes after \"Marienhof\" was canceled, and the network tried to decide on whether to revamp its lineup.\n\nWhile \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\", \"Unter uns\" and \"Alles was zählt\" are currently the only daily soaps on the air after \"Verbotene Liebe\" has been cancelled and aired its last episode in June, 2015 due to low ratings, the telenovelas \"Sturm der Liebe\" and \"Rote Rosen\" are considered soaps by the press as well, thanks to the changing protagonists every season.\n\nIn Belgium, the two major soap operas are \"Thuis\" (\"Home\") and \"Familie\" (\"Family\"). Soap operas have been very popular in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. \"Familie\" debuted in late 1991, and with nearly 6,000 half-hour episodes, it has the highest episode total of any soap in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. The highest-rated soap opera is \"Thuis\", which has aired on \"één\" since late 1995. \"Thuis\" is often one of the five most-watched Belgian shows and regularly garners over one million viewers (with 6.3 million Flemmings in total).\n\nDuring the 1990s, foreign soap operas such as \"Neighbours\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" were extremely popular, the latter having achieved a cult status in Belgium and airing in the middle of the decade during prime time. Both soaps still air today, along with other foreign soaps such as \"Days of Our Lives\", Australia's \"Home and Away\" and Germany's \"Sturm der Liebe\". Vitaya unsuccessful attempted to air the Dutch soap opera \"Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden\" in 2010. Other foreign soaps that previously aired on Belgian television include \"The Young and the Restless\", \"EastEnders\" (both on VTM), \"Port Charles\" (at één, then known as TV1) and \"Coronation Street\" (on Vitaya). \"Santa Barbara\" aired during the 1990s on VTM for its entire run.\n\nThe only teen soap opera on Belgian television was \"Spring\" (\"Jump\" in English), which aired on the youth-oriented Ketnet and produced over 600 15-minute episodes from late 2002 until 2009, when it was cancelled after a steady decline in ratings following the departures of many of its original characters.\n\nThe most successful soap opera in Italy is the evening series \"Un posto al sole\" (\"A Place Under the Sun\"), which had aired on Rai 3 since 1996 (whose format is based on the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\"). Several other Italian soaps have been produced such as \"Ricominciare\" (\"Starting Over\"), \"Cuori rubati\" (\"Stolen Hearts\"), \"Vivere\" (\"Living\"), \"Sottocasa\" (\"Downstairs\"), \"Agrodolce\" (\"Bittersweet\") and \"Centovetrine\" (\"Hundred Shop Windows\").\n\nThe most popular Italian prime-time drama series, \"Incantesimo\" (\"Enchantment\"), which ran from 1998 to 2008, became a daytime soap opera for the final two years of its run, airing five days a week on Rai 1.\n\nIn the early years of RTÉ, the network produced several dramas but had not come close to launching a long-running serial. RTÉ's first television soap was \"Tolka Row\", which was set in urban Dublin. For several years, both \"Tolka Row\" and \"The Riordans\" were produced by RTÉ; however, the urban soap was soon dropped in favor of the more popular rural soap opera \"The Riordans\", which premiered in 1965. Executives from Yorkshire Television visited during on-location shoots for \"The Riordans\" in the early 1970s and in 1972, debuted \"Emmerdale Farm\" (now \"Emmerdale\"), based on the successful format of the Irish soap opera. In the late 1970s, \"The Riordans\" was controversially dropped. The creator of that series would then go on to produce the second of his \"Agri-soap\" trilogy \"Bracken\", starring Gabriel Byrne, whose character had appeared in the last few seasons of \"The Riordans\". Bracken was soon replaced by the third \"Agri-soap\" \"Glenroe\", which ran until 2001. As RTÉ wanted a drama series for its Sunday night lineup rather than a soap opera, \"On Home Ground\" (2001–2002), \"The Clinic\" (2002–2009) and \"RAW\" (2010–2013) replaced the agri-soaps of the previous decades.\n\nIn 1989, RTÉ decided to produce its first Dublin-based soap opera since the 1960s. \"Fair City\", which is set in the fictional city of Carrickstown, initially aired one night a week during the 1989-90 season, and similar to its rural soaps, much of the footage was filmed on location – in a suburb of Dublin City. In 1992, RTÉ made a major investment into the series by copying the houses used in the on-location shoots for an on-site set in RTÉ's Headquarters in Dublin 4. By the early 1990s, it was airing two nights a week for 35 weeks a year. With competition from the UK soap operas, RTÉ expanded \"Fair City\" to three nights a week for most of the year and one night a week during the summer in 1996, later expanding to four nights a week and two nights during the summer. Until the early 2000s, the series produced four episodes a week, airing all 52 weeks of the year. \"Fair City\" airs Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8.00 p.m. GMT on RTÉ One; however, after rival network TV3 moved \"Coronation Street\" to Thursday night, the Wednesday night episode of \"Fair City\" began airing at 7:30 p.m. each week.\n\nTG4 produce the Irish language soap \"Ros na Rún\" (\"Headland of the Secrets\" or \"Headland of the Sweethearts\"); set in the fictional village of \"Ros Na Rún\", located outside Galway and near Spiddal, it centres on the domestic and professional lives of the town's residents. It is modeled on an average village in the West of Ireland, but with its own distinct personality – with a diverse population that share secrets, romances and friendships among other things. While the core community has remained the same, the look and feel of \"Ros Na Rún\" has changed and evolved over the years to incorporate the changing face of rural Ireland. It has an established a place not only in the hearts and minds of the Irish speaking public, but also the wider Irish audience. The program has dealt with many topics, including domestic violence, infidelity, theft, arson, abortion, homosexuality, adoption, murder, rape, drugs, teen pregnancy and paedophilia. It runs twice a week for 35 weeks of the year, currently airing Tuesday and Thursday nights. \"Ros na Rún\" is the single largest independent production commissioned in the history of Irish broadcasting. Prior to TG4's launch, it originally aired on RTÉ One in the early 1990s.\n\nAlthough Ireland has access to international soaps (such as \"Coronation Street\", \"Emmerdale\", \"EastEnders\", \"Home and Away\", \"Hollyoaks\" and \"Neighbours\"), \"Fair City\" continues to outperform them all, and is Ireland's most popular soap opera, with the show peaking at over 700,000 viewers.\n\nJanuary 2015 \"Red Rock\" has broadcast on TV3. Red Rock airs twice a week on Wednesday and Thursday nights. The series is base in a fishing village in Dublin. The soaps centres around the local Garda station but also includes stories from the village.\n\nRTÉ Radio produced its first radio soap, \"Kennedys of Castleross\", which ran from April 13, 1955 to 1975. In 1979 RTÉ long running TV soap The Riordans moved to Radio until December 24, 1985. In the mid-1980s, RTÉ debuted a new radio soap, \"Harbour Hotel\", which ran until the mid-1990s. The network later ran two short-lived radio soaps, \"Konvenience Korner\" and \"Riverrun\", which were followed in 2004 by \"Driftwood\". RTÉ does not run any radio soaps, however RTÉ Radio 1 continues to air radio dramas as part of its nighttime schedule.\n\n\nIn Greece, there have been several soap operas.\n\nAn early serial was \"Sti skia tou hrimatos\" (\"Money Shadows\"), which ran from 1990 to 1991. September 1991 saw the debut of \"Lampsi\" (\"the Shining\"), from creator Nicos Foskolos. The series would become Greece's longest-running soap opera. After the success of \"Lampsi\" came the short lived \"To galazio diamandi\" (\"Blue Diamond\") and \"Simphonia siopis\" (\"Omertà\"). \"Lampsi\" was canceled in June 2005 due to declining ratings. It was replaced by \"Erotas\" (\"Love\"), a soap that ran from 2005 to 2008. After that series ended, ANT1 abandoned the soap opera genre and focused on comedy series and weekly dramas.\n\nGreece's second longest-running soap is \"Kalimera Zoi\" (\"Goodmorning Life\"), which ran from September 1993 until its cancellation in June 2006 due to low ratings.\n\nMega Channel began producing soap operas in 1990 with the prime time serial \"I Dipsa\" (\"The Thirst\"), which ran for 102 episodes. Other daytime soaps have included \"Paralliloi dromoi\" (1992–1994) and its successor \"Haravgi\" (\"Daylight\", 1994–1995), both of which were cancelled due to low viewership; as well as the serials \"Apagorevmeni Agapi\" (\"Forbidden Love\"), which ran from 1998 to 2006; \"Gia mia thesi ston Ilio\" (\"A Spot Under the Sun\"), which ran from 1998 to 2002; \"Filodoxies\" (\"Expectations\"), which ran from 2002 to 2006; and \"Vera Sto Deksi\" (\"Ring on the Right Hand\"), which ran from 2004 to 2006 and proved to be a successful competitor to \"Lampsi\", causing that show's ratings to decline.\n\n\"Ta Mistika Tis Edem\" (\"Edem Secrets\"), which was created by the producers of \"Vera Sto Deksi\", debuted in 2008 and has eclipsed that show's success. Its ratings place it consistently among the three highest-rated daytime programs.\n\nIENED (which was renamed ERT2 in 1982) was responsible for the first Greek soap operas \"I Kravgi Ton Likon\" and \"Megistanes\". ERT also produced the long-running soap \"O Simvoleografos\". Since 2000 and with the introduction of private television, ERT produced additional daily soap operas, which included \"Pathos\" (\"Passion\"), \"Erotika tis Edem\" (\"Loving in Eden\") and \"Ta ftera tou erota\" (\"The Wings of Love\"). These failed to achieve high ratings and were canceled shortly after their premiere.\n\nAlpha produced \"Kato apo tin Acropoli\" (\"Under the Acropolis\"), which ran for 2½ years.\n\nThe first daytime soap opera produced by a Cyprus channel was LOGOs TV's \"Odos Den Ksehno\" (\"'Don't Forget' Street\"), which ran from January to December 1996. It was followed by \"To Serial\", which also ran for one year from September 1997 to June 1998. CyBC created the third weekdaily soap, \"Anemi Tou Pathous\" (\"Passion Winds\"), running from January 2000 to June 2004, which was replaced by \"I Platia\" (\"The Square\") from September 2004 to July 2006. \"Epikindini Zoni\" ran from 2009 to 2010, and was cancelled after 120 episodes. \"Vimata Stin Ammo\" made its debut in September 2010.\n\nSigma TV first commissioned the weekdaily comedic soap \"Sto Para Pente\", which aired from September 1998 to June 2004, and first held the distinction of being the longest weekday show in Cyprus television history, before it was surpassed by \"Se Fonto Kokkino\", which ran from September 2008 to July 2012. Other Sigma TV weekday shows include \"Akti Oniron\" (which ran from 1999 to 2001), \"Vourate Geitonoi\" (which ran from 2001 to 2005, and was the most successful weekdaily series, achieving ratings shares of up to 70% of all television households in the country), \"Oi Takkoi\" (which ran from 2002 to 2005), \"S' Agapo\" (which ran from 2001 to 2002), \"Vasiliki\" (which ran from 2005 to 2006), \"Vendetta\" (which ran from September 2005 to December 2006), \"30 kai Kati\" (which ran from 2006 to 2007) and \"Mila Mou\" (which ran from September 2007 to January 2009).\n\nANT1 Cyprus aired the soap \"I Goitia Tis Amartias\" in 2002, which was soon canceled. \"Dikse Mou To Filo Sou\" followed from 2006 to 2009, along with \"Gia Tin Agapi Sou\", which ran from 2008 to 2009 and itself was followed by \"Panselinos\", which has aired since 2009.\n\nThe longest-running weekly show on Cyprus television is \"Istories Tou Horkou\" (\"Villages Stories\", which premiered on CyBC in March 1996 and ran until its cancellation in June 2006; it was revived in September 2010 but was cancelled again in March 2011 due to very low ratings), followed by \"Manolis Ke Katina\" (\"Manolis and Katina\", which ran from 1995 to 2004). The most controversial of these series was \"To Kafenio\" (\"The Coffee Shop\"), which premiered on CyBC on 1993 as a weekly series, before moving to MEGA Channel Cyprus six years later in 1999 as a weekdaily show and then moved to ANT1 Cyprus on 2000, which canceled the show one year later. There were plans to move the show back to CyBC as a weekly series in 2001, with the original cast, however this plan was never realised. The most successful weekly shows in Cyprus currently are ANT1's \"Eleni I Porni\" (\"Eleni, The Whore\"), which premiered in October 2010 and CyBC's \"Stin Akri Tu Paradisou\" (\"At The Heaven's Edge\"), which premiered in 2007. The most successful weekdaily soap was \"Aigia Fuxia\", which aired on ANT1 Cyprus from 2008 to 2010.\n\nThe only daily Finnish soap opera so far is \"Salatut elämät\" (\"Secret Lives\"), which has achieved popularity in Finland since its 1999 debut on MTV3. It focuses on the lives of people along the imaginary Pihlajakatu street in Helsinki. The show has also spawned several Internet spin-off series and a film based on the show that was released in 2012.\n\nOther soap-like shows in Finland are YLE shows \"Uusi päivä\" (which has aired since 2009) and \"Kotikatu\" (which ran from 1995 to 2012), however these programs do not adhere to a five-episode-a-week schedule.\n\nWith the advent of internet television and mobile phones, several soap operas have also been produced specifically for these platforms, including \"\", a spin-off of the established \"EastEnders\". For those produced only for the mobile phone, episodes may generally consist of about six or seven pictures and accompanying text.\n\nOn September 13, 2011, TG4 launched a new 10-part online series titled, \"Na Rúin\" (an Internet spin-off of \"Ros na Rún\"). The miniseries took on the theme of a mystery; the viewer had to read Rachel and Lorcán's blogs as well as watch video diaries detailing each character's thoughts to solve the mystery of missing teenage character Ciara.\n\nIn motion pictures, the 1982 comedy \"Tootsie\" has the lead character impersonating a woman in order to gain acting work on a long running television soap opera. Several scenes parody the production of soaps, their outrageous storylines and idiosyncratic stylistic elements.\n\nThe 1991 comedy \"Soapdish\" stars Sally Field as an aging soap opera actress on fictional series \"The Sun Also Sets\" who pines over her own neuroses and misfortunes such as her live-in boyfriend who leaves her to go back to his wife, and the incidents of backstabbing and scheming behind the scenes, some of which are more interesting than the stories on the program.\n\nAnother 1991 comedy, Delirious, stars John Candy as a soap opera writer who, after a head injury, has a dream experience of being in his own creation. The dream experience is an increasingly outrageous exaggeration of soap opera plot elements.\n\nOn television, several soap opera parodies have been produced:\n\n"}
{"id": "464766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=464766", "title": "Stroke order", "text": "Stroke order\n\nStroke order refers to the order in which the strokes of a Chinese character (or Chinese derivative character) are written. A stroke is a movement of a writing instrument on a writing surface. Chinese characters are used in various forms in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. They are known as \"Hanzi\" in (Mandarin Chinese), \"kanji\" in Japanese, and \"Hanja\" in Korean. Stroke order is also attested in other logographic scripts, e.g. cuneiform.\n\nChinese characters are basically logograms constructed with strokes. Over the millennia a set of generally agreed rules have been developed by custom. Minor variations exist between countries, but the basic principles remain the same, namely that writing characters should be economical, with the fewest hand movements to write the most strokes possible. This promotes writing speed, accuracy, and readability. This idea is particularly important since as learners progress, characters often get more complex. Since stroke order also aids learning and memorization, students are often taught about it from a very early age in schools and encouraged to follow them. \n\nThe Eight Principles of Yong (永字八法 Pinyin: \"yǒngzì bā fǎ\"; Japanese: \"eiji happō\"; Korean: 영자팔법, \"yeongjapalbeop\", \"yŏngjap'albŏp\") uses the single character , meaning \"eternity\", to teach eight of the most basic strokes in Regular Script.\n\nIn ancient China, the Jiǎgǔwén characters carved on ox scapula and tortoise plastrons showed no indication of stroke order. The characters show huge variations from piece to piece, sometimes even within one piece. During the divination ceremony, after the cracks were made, the characters were written with a brush on the shell or bone (to be carved in a workshop later). Although the brush-written stroke order is not discernible after carving, there exists some evidence that it was not entirely idiosyncratic: a few of the characters, often marginal administrative notations recording the provenance of the shells or bones, were not later recarved, and the stroke order of these characters tends to resemble traditional and modern stroke order. For those characters (the vast majority) which were later engraved into the hard surface using a knife, perhaps by a separate individual, there is evidence (from incompletely engraved pieces) that in at least some cases all the strokes running one way were carved, then the piece was turned, and strokes running another way were then carved.\n\nIn early Imperial China, the common script was the Xiaozhuan style. About 220 BC, the emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first to conquer all of China, imposed Li Si's character uniformisation, a set of 3300 standardized \"Xiǎozhuàn\" characters. Its graphs on old steles — some dating from 200 BC — reveal indications of the stroke order of the time. However, stroke order could still not yet be ascertained from the steles, and no paper from that time is extant.\n\nThe true starting point of stroke order is the Lìshū style (clerical script) which is more regularized, and in some ways similar to modern text. In theory, by looking at the Lìshū style steles' graphs and the placement of each stroke, one can see hierarchical priority between the strokes, which indicates the stroke order used by the calligrapher or stele sculptors.\n\nKǎishū style (regular script) — still in use today — is more regularized, allowing one to more easily guess the stroke order used to write on the steles. The stroke order 1000 years ago was similar to that toward the end of Imperial China. For example, the stroke order of 广 is clear in the Kangxi dictionary of 1716; but in a modern book, the official stroke order (the same) will not appear clearly. The Kangxi and current shapes have tiny differences, while current stroke order is still the same, according to the old style. However, the stroke orders implied by the Kangxi dictionary are not necessarily similar to nowadays' norm.\n\nCursive styles such as \"Xíngshū\" (semi-cursive or running script) and \"Cǎoshū\" (cursive or grass script) show stroke order more clearly than Regular Script, as each move made by the writing tool is visible.\n\nThe modern governments of mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan have standardized official stroke orders to be taught in schools. These stroke order standards are prescribed in conjunction to each government's standard character sets. The various official stroke orders agree on the vast majority of characters, but each have their differences. No governmental standard matches traditional stroke orders completely. The differences between the governmental standards and traditional stroke orders arise from accommodation for schoolchildren who may be overwhelmed if the rules about stroke orders are too detailed, or if there are too many exceptions. The differences listed below are not exhaustive.\n\nBesides general errors and regional differences in stroke order, it is common in the PRC to apply alternative stroke orders which resemble PRC stroke orders to Traditional Chinese characters, although the PRC generally uses Simplified characters. In the below example, the traditional character 問 (simplified: 问) is shown with both the traditional stroke order (left, starting with the left vertical stroke), as in imperial China, Taiwan, Japan, and Hong Kong, and with the Simplified stroke order (right, with the left vertical stroke fourth).\n\"Note: There are exceptions within and among different standards. The following are only guidelines.\"\n\n1. Write from top to bottom, and left to right. \n\nAs a general rule, strokes are written from top to bottom and left to right. For example, among the first characters usually learned is the number one, which is written with a single horizontal line: 一. This character has one stroke which is written from left to right.\n\nThe character for \"two\" has two strokes: 二. In this case, both are written from left to right, but the top stroke is written first. The character for \"three\" has three strokes: 三. Each stroke is written from left to right, starting with the uppermost stroke.\n\nThis rule also applies to the order of components. For example, 校 can be divided into two. The entire left side (木) is written before the right side (交). There are some exceptions to this rule, mainly occurring when the right side of a character has a lower enclosure (see below).\n\nWhen there are upper and lower components, the upper components are written first, then the lower components, as in 品 and 星.\n\n2. Horizontal before vertical \n\nWhen horizontal and vertical strokes cross, horizontal strokes are usually written before vertical strokes: the character for \"ten,\" 十, has two strokes. The horizontal stroke 一 is written first, followed by the vertical stroke → 十.\n\nIn the Japanese standard, a vertical stroke may precede many intersecting horizontal strokes if the vertical stroke does not pass through the lowest horizontal stroke.\n\n3. Character-spanning strokes last \n\nVertical strokes that pass through many other strokes are written after the strokes through which they pass, as in 聿 and 弗.\n\nHorizontal strokes that pass through many other strokes are written last, as in 毋 and 舟.\n\n4. Diagonals right-to-left before diagonals left-to-right \n\nRight-to-left diagonals (丿) are written before left-to-right diagonals (乀): 文.\n\nNote that this is for symmetric diagonals; for asymmetric diagonals, as in 戈, the left-to-right may precede the right-to-left, based on other rules.\n\n5. Center before outside in vertically symmetrical characters \n\nIn vertically symmetrical characters, the center components are written before components on the left or right. Components on the left are written before components on the right, as in 兜 and 承.\n\n6. Enclosures before contents \n\nOutside enclosing components are written before inside components; bottom strokes in the enclosure are written last if present, as in 日 and 口. (A common mnemonic is \"Put people inside first, then close the door.\") Enclosures may also have no bottom stroke, as in 同 and 月.\n\n7. Left vertical before enclosing \n\nLeft vertical strokes are written before enclosing strokes. In the following two examples, the leftmost vertical stroke (|) is written first, followed by the uppermost and rightmost lines (┐) (which are written as one stroke): 日 and 口.\n\n8. Bottom enclosures last \n\nBottom enclosing components are usually written last: 道, 建, 凶.\n\n9. Dots and minor strokes last \n\nMinor strokes are usually written last, as the small \"dot\" in the following: 玉, 求, 朮.\n\nThere are various ways to describe the stroke order of a character. Children learn the stroke order in courses, as part of writing learning. Various graphical representations are possible, most notably successive images of the character with one more stroke added (or changing color) each time, numbering strokes, color-coding, fanning, and more recently animations. Stroke order is often described in person by writing characters on paper or in the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40185993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40185993", "title": "Strong female character", "text": "Strong female character\n\nStrong female character is a term for a class of stock character. It is the opposite of the damsel in distress stock character. In the first half of the 20th century, the rise of mainstream feminism and the increased use of the concept in the later 20th century have reduced the concept to a standard item of pop culture fiction.\n\nWhether female characters are strong enough is often used as a gauge of story quality by critics, in a similar manner to whether the story passes the Bechdel test. However, some have criticized this metric for causing authors to avoid creating female characters with realistic weaknesses.\n\nAccording to Carina Chocano, the strong female character has become a \"cinematic cliché\", resulting in character archetypes like the \"alpha professional\" whose laser-like focus on career advancement has caused her to become a \"grim, celibate automaton\", and the \"gloomy ninja with commitment issues\". By this metric, the strong female character is a woman with the gendered behavior taken out. There is no clear consensus on the definition of \"strong female character\". Some believe it describes characters with powerful physical abilities, such as those of Buffy Summers or Katniss Everdeen. Others believe it to represent the quality of a character's \"inner life\" and their relative importance in the story.\n\nDespite the archetype arising largely through feminism, it has not been universally well received by those supportive of women's rights. Sophia McDougall of the \"New Statesman\" has criticized the high prevalence of strong female characters for creating a cliché that represents women as unrealistically strong; she argues that the simplicity of this archetype does little to present women in media in a realistic, complex way. Carina Chocano from \"The New York Times\" has offered similar criticism for the \"shorthand meme\" of strong female characters; while she sees them as a \"gateway drug\" to realistic representation, she takes offense at the implication that female characters are \"not interesting or worth identifying with\" if they are not cold, flawless, and masculine. In contrast, Alison Willmore of BuzzFeed takes issue with popular interpretation of the word \"strong\" rather than with the archetype itself; she prefers strong female characters in the sense of well-developed ones given a legitimate point of view over \"badass\" ones. Kelly Faircloth of the feminist blog Jezebel believes that strong female characters are not enough or required, but that women must have integral roles in the plot apart from helping men realize theirs (rather than, \"seamlessly replace[able] with a floor lamp\").\n\n"}

{"id": "8588592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8588592", "title": "Timothy Sullivan", "text": "Timothy Sullivan\n\nTimothy Daniel Sullivan (July 23, 1862 – August 31, 1913) was a New York politician who controlled Manhattan's Bowery and Lower East Side districts as a prominent leader within Tammany Hall. He was euphemistically known as \"Dry Dollar\", as the \"Big Feller\", and, later, as \"Big Tim\" (because of his physical stature). He amassed a large fortune as a businessman running vaudeville and legitimate theaters, as well as nickelodeons, race tracks and athletic clubs. Sullivan in 1911 pushed through the legislature the Sullivan Act, an early gun control measure. He was a strong supporter of organized labor and women's suffrage. The newspapers depicted Big Tim as the spider in the center of the web, overstating his criminal activities and his control over gambling in the city. Welch says that, \"assigning the role of vice lord to Sullivan gave Tammany's enemies a weapon to be wielded in every municipal election between 1886 and 1912.\n\nHe was born in the slum of Five Points to Daniel O. Sullivan and his wife Catherine Connelly (or Conley), immigrants from Kenmare, County Kerry, Ireland. His father, a Union veteran of the American Civil War, died of Typhus in October 1867 at age thirty-six, leaving his wife to care for their four children. Three years later, Catherine Sullivan married again to an alcoholic laborer of Irish descent named Lawrence Mulligan, having six children by him.\n\nAt age eight, Tim Sullivan began shining shoes and selling newspapers on Park Row in lower Manhattan. By his mid-twenties, he was the part or full owner of six saloons, which was the career of choice for aspiring politicians. Sullivan attracted the attention of local politicians, notably Thomas \"Fatty\" Walsh, a prominent Tammany Hall ward leader and father of stage actress Blanche Walsh.\n\nIn 1886, Sullivan married Helen Fitzgerald. He gradually began building one of the most powerful political machines, which would control virtually all jobs and vice below 14th Street in Manhattan. His base was his headquarters at 207 Bowery. By 1892, Tammany Hall leader Richard Croker appointed Sullivan leader of his assembly district of the Lower East Side.\n\nSullivan was a member of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 2nd D.) in 1887, 1888, 1889, 1890, 1891, 1892 and 1893.\n\nHe was a member of the New York State Senate from 1894 to 1902, sitting in the 117th, 118th (both 9th D.), 119th, 120th, 121st, 122nd, 123rd, 124th and 125th New York State Legislatures (all seven 11th D.).\n\nHe was elected as a Democrat to the 58th and 59th United States Congresses, holding office from March 4, 1903, until his resignation on July 27, 1906. According to some accounts, Sullivan was dissatisfied with the graft and anonymity of Washington political life, prompting his resignation. he was quoted as saying, \"There's nothing in this Congressman business. They know 'em in Washington. The people down there use 'em as hitchin'-posts. Every time they see a Congressman on the streets they tie their horses to him.\"\n\nHe was again a member of the State Senate (12th D.) from 1909 to 1912, sitting in the 132nd, 133rd, 134th and 135th New York State Legislatures. In November 1912, he was elected to the 63rd United States Congress but, due to ill health, did not take his seat, and died a few months into his term.\n\nIt could be said that Sullivan was one of the earliest political reformers, since he was aligned with women's rights activist Frances Perkins and sponsored legislation limiting the maximum number of hours women were forced to work, improving the conditions of stable and delivery horses and the Sullivan Law, city gun control legislation.\n\nDespite his political and criminal activities, Sullivan was undeniably a successful businessman involved in real estate, theatrical ventures (at one point partnering with Marcus Loew), boxing and horseracing.\n\nAlong with various other Sullivans, Big Tim also branched out into popular amusement venues such as Dreamland in Coney Island, where he installed a distant relative, Dennis, as the political leader. Sullivan, whose control extended to illegal prizefights through the National Athletic Club, influenced the New York State Legislature to legalize boxing in 1896 before ring deaths and other scandals caused the law's repeal four years later.\n\nAmong other laws he helped pass was the Sullivan Act, a state law that required a permit to carry or own a concealed weapon, which eventually became law on May 29, 1911. Upon first passage, the Sullivan Act required licenses for New Yorkers to possess firearms small enough to be concealed. Possession of such firearms without a license was a misdemeanor, and carrying them was a felony. However, with many residents unable to afford the $3 registration fee issued by the corrupt New York Police Department, his bodyguards could be legally armed while using the law against their political opponents.\n\nHe was extremely popular among his constituents. In the hot summer months, tenement dwellers would be feted to steamboat excursions and picnics to College Point in Queens or New Jersey. In the winter months, the Sullivan machine doled out food, coal and clothing to his constituents. On the anniversary of his mother's birthday, February 6, Sullivan dispensed shoes to needy tenement dwellers. The annual Christmas Dinners were a particularly notable event covered in all of the city papers. Although he had a loyal following, his involvement in organized crime and political protection of street gangs and vice districts would remain a source of controversy throughout his career.\n\nSullivan was an expert in using electoral fraud to retain his power. In a quid pro quo arrangement, constituents voted the way that they were instructed. In return, they were the recipients of Tammany largesse which included coal in the winter, clambakes and outings in the summer, jobs on the city payroll and all-around assistance. In 1892 when his pct went 395 to 4 for Grover Cleveland over Benjamin Harrison in the presidential election he said, \"Harrison got one...more vote than I expected, but I'll find that feller!\" His most common tactic, with no voter ID, was to use \"repeaters.\" Here's how he described it, \"When you've voted'em with their whiskers on you take'em to a barber and scrap off the chin-fringe. Then you vote'em again with side lilacs and a mustache. Then to a barber again, off comes the sides and you vote'em a third time with the mustache. If that ain't enough, and the box can stand a few more ballots, clean off the mustache and vote'em plain face. That makes every one of 'em good for four votes.\" (Rothstein by David Pietrusza. Pgs 53-55.)\n\nDuring the turn of the century, he would develop contacts with many influential figures including Monk Eastman, Paul Kelly, Arnold Rothstein and disgraced NYPD Lieutenant Charles Becker, who was able to attain the latter a high-ranking position on the New York police force in 1893.\n\nA close associate of Charles Francis Murphy, who succeeded the exiled Richard Croker as head of Tammany Hall in May 1902, the two forced corrupt police chief William Stephen Devery out of Tammany's Executive Committee as part of Murphy's campaign to eliminate any direct links between vice districts and Tammany Hall.\n\nHowever, Sullivan was allowed to keep his kickbacks from the Lower East Side and Chinatown as a means of keeping him from becoming Murphy's political rival (he had used his considerable political influence from keeping Croker's reform group, the \"Committee of Five\", out of the Bowery only two years before). In exchange, Sullivan would have to furnish gang leaders Monk Eastman and Paul Kelly, amongst others, to commit election fraud on behalf of Tammany Hall.\n\nAt the time, it was widely known that Sullivan and his subordinates were active in a number of illegal activities including prostitution, gambling and extortion. A number of these revelations came to light in the New York State Lexow Committee hearings as well as through the investigations of the Rev. Charles Henry Parkhurst.\n\nSuffering from tertiary syphilis during his later years, his health continued to deteriorate until he was judged mentally incompetent and finally committed to a sanitarium in 1912. According to the Incompetency hearings, Sullivan elicited paranoid delusions, believed he was being spied upon and his food was being poisoned. On January 12, 1913, the New York Sun reported in a prominent page two article that he was mourned after being committed, \"beyond cure\" (without naming illness), suffering from \"religious mania\".\n\nAfter nearly a year, he managed to escape from his brother's house after eluding nurses on the early morning of August 31 (although other accounts claim he had escaped from orderlies after an all-night card game). Within a few hours, his body was found on the tracks in the Eastchester area of the Bronx, New York.\n\nSullivan's family did not report him missing for more than ten days, and his body was brought, and held, at the local Fordham morgue. Finally, after a fortnight, Sullivan was classified as a vagrant and scheduled for burial in Potter's Field despite his tailored clothing and \"TDS\" diamond monogrammed cufflinks.\n\nJust before removal, his body was finally recognized by Police Officer Peter Purfield, who was assigned to the morgue detail. (The New York Times later speculated that Sullivan might have been killed and placed on the tracks. In fact, the engineer of the train that struck Sullivan stated that he thought the body was already deceased. And, adding to the speculation of foul play, Thomas Reigelmann, the Bronx coroner and Tammany political appointee who signed the death certificate, failed to recognize the body of his longtime friend despite the lack of trauma to the decedent's face.)\n\nSullivan's wake was held at his clubhouse, located at 207 Bowery and over 25,000 people turned out for his funeral at St. Patrick's Old Cathedral, New York on Mott Street. He was interred in Calvary Cemetery, Queens, New York.\n\nFor the next seven or eight years, there was a protracted battle over Sullivan's estate, which, by some estimates, ranged as high as $2.5 million. After creditors were satisfied, the bulk of the assets went to Sullivan's full siblings, Patrick H., Mary Anne, and half-brother, Lawrence Mulligan. (For several years after Big Tim's death, Patrick H. Sullivan attempted to maintain his late brother's political and criminal clout. However, he proved to be an ineffectual leader and requitted himself from politics to pursue real estate ventures).\n\nSullivan had one child with his wife Helen, a daughter who died in infancy.\nHe did, however, father at least six illegitimate children, many with actresses affiliated with his theatrical ventures, two of whom were Christie MacDonald and Elsie Janis.\n\nHe was portrayed by Joseph Sullivan in the 1914 silent film \"The Life of Big Tim Sullivan; Or, From Newsboy to Senator\", one of the earliest people to be the subject of a biographical film. He was also a main character in Kevin Baker's novel \"Dreamland\", about life in turn-of-the-century New York, set in part in the Coney Island amusement park of the same name.\n\nOn film himself, Sullivan appeared in a silent short \"Actors' Fund Field Day\", a 1910 short film denoting an actors' fundraising. Sullivan more than likely knew many of the persons in the film.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9052729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9052729", "title": "White Latin Americans", "text": "White Latin Americans\n\nWhite Latin Americans, or European Latin Americans, are Latin Americans who are considered white, typically due to European, or in some cases Levantine, descent. Latin American countries have often encouraged miscegenation, and even a small amount of European ancestry could entail significant upwards social mobility.\n\nPeople descended from European settlers who arrived in the Americas during the colonial and post-independence periods can be found throughout Latin America. Most of the earliest settlers were Spanish and Portuguese; after independence, the most numerous immigrants have been Spanish and Italians, followed by Germans, Levantine Semites, Poles, Irish, British, French, Russians, Belgians, Dutch, Scandinavians, Ukrainians, Hungarians, Croats, Swiss, Greeks, and other Europeans.\n\nComposing from 33% to 36% of the population , according to some sources, White Latin Americans constitute the largest racial-ethnic group in the region. \"White\" is the self-identification of many Latin Americans in some national censuses. According to a survey conducted by \"Cohesión Social\" in Latin America, conducted on a sample of 10,000 people from seven countries of the region, 34% of those interviewed identified themselves as white.\n\n\"Being white\" is a term that emerged from a tradition of racial classification that developed as Europeans colonized large parts of the world and employed classificatory systems to distinguish themselves from the local inhabitants. However, while most present-day racial classifications include a concept of being white that is ideologically connected to European heritage and specific phenotypic and biological features associated with European heritage, there are differences in how people are classified. These differences arise from the various historical processes and social contexts in which a given racial classification is used. As Latin America is characterized by differing histories and social contexts, there is also variance in the perception of whiteness throughout Latin America.\n\nAccording to Peter Wade specialist in race concepts of Latin America\n\n...racial categories and racial ideologies are not simply those that elaborate social constructions on the basis of phenotypical variation or ideas about innate difference but those that do so using the particular aspects of phenotypical variation that were worked into vital signifiers of difference during European colonial encounters with others.\n\nIn many parts of Latin America being white is more a matter of socio-economic status than specific phenotypic traits, and it is often said that in Latin America \"money whitens\" Within Latin America there are variations in how racial boundaries have been defined. In Argentina, for example, the notion of mixture has been downplayed. Alternately, in countries like Mexico and Brazil mixture has been emphasized as fundamental for nation-building, resulting in a large group of bi-racial \"mestizos\", in Mexico, or tri-racial \"pardos\", in Brazil, who are considered neither fully white nor fully non-white.\n\nUnlike in the United States where ancestry may be used exclusively to define race, by the 1970s, Latin American scholars came to agree that race in Latin America could not be understood as the \"genetic composition of individuals\" but instead must be \"based upon a combination of cultural, social, and somatic considerations\". In Latin America, a person's ancestry may not be decisive in racial classification. For example, full-blooded siblings can often be classified as belonging to different races (Harris 1964).\n\nFor these reasons the distinction between \"white\" and \"mixed\", and between \"mixed\" and \"black\" and \"indigenous\", is largely subjective and situational, meaning that any attempt to classify by discrete racial categories is fraught with problems.\n\nPeople of European origin began to arrive in the Americas in the 15th century since the first voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492. After the Wars of Independence, the elites of most of the countries of the region concluded that their underdevelopment was caused by their populations being mostly Amerindian, Mestizo or Mulatto; so a major process of \"whitening\" was required, or at least desirable. Most Latin American countries then implemented blanqueamiento policies to promote European immigration, and some were quite successful, especially Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil. From the late 19th century to the early 20th century, the number of European immigrants who arrived far surpassed the number of original colonists. Between 1821 and 1932, of a total 15 million immigrants who arrived in Latin America, Argentina received 6.4 million, and Brazil 5.5 million.\n\nThe following table shows estimates (in thousands) of white, black/mulatto, Amerindian, and mestizo populations of Latin America, from the 17th to the 20th centuries. The figures shown are, for the years between 1650 and 1980, from the Arias' \"The Cry of My People...\", for 2000, from Lizcano's \"Composición Étnica...\". Percentages are by the editor.\n\nSince European colonization, Latin America's population has had a long history of intermixing, so that many Latin Americans who have Native American or sub-Saharan African or, rarely, East Asian ancestry have European ancestry as well. The \"casta\" system, a primarily race-based classification that was used in colonial Latin America designated people according to its racial background, with the main classifications being \"indio\" (used to refer to Native American people), \"criollo\" (those of complete European ancestry born in Latin America, or in cases, people who were 7/8 or more European and 1/8 Indigenous or less), \"castizo\" (3/4 European, 1/4 Indigenous), or \"mestizo\" (1/2 European, 1/2 Indigenous), \"negro\" (Sub-Saharan Africans) \"mulato\" (1/2 European, 1/2 African), \"zambo\" (1/2 African, 1/2 Indigenous), \"Pardo\" (persons with European, African and Indigenous ancestry), and \"Peninsulares\" who were Europeans born in Spain or other European countries such as Portugal in the case of Portuguese colonies.\n\nAs in Spain, persons of even remote Jewish or Moorish ancestry were not allowed to enroll in the Spanish Army or the Catholic Church in the colonies. Applicants to both institutions, and their spouses, had to obtain a \"Limpieza de sangre\" (purity of blood) certificate that proved that they had no Jewish or Moorish ancestors, in the same way as those in the Peninsula did. However, being a medieval concept that targeted exclusively those religious groups, it was never an issue among the native population in the colonies of the Spanish Empire, which by law allowed people from all racial groups to join the army, with being of the Catholic faith the only prerequisite. One notable example was that of Francisco Menendez, a freed-black military officer of the Spanish Army during the 18th century at the Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose fort in St. Augustine, Florida.\n\nAlthough historically both Colonial and Imperial Brazil had institutionalized discrimination against citizens who were deemed people of color, it never had a casta system like that of Hispanic America. White Brazilians equivalent in status to the Hispanic criollo could have less than 80% European (overwhelmingly Portuguese) ancestry. Having some Amerindian and black African ancestry—which is widespread among white Brazilians, among all social classes in its five geographic regions since the 16th to 17th centuries—as well as having Moorish, Jewish, Arab, or Romani ancestry, affected social status less than in Hispanic America, This does not mean that the social status of \"fully non-white\" people (people of color who are not mulattoes, mestizos, zambos, pardos, etc.—in short, Mixed-race Brazilians—even with Caucasian features); \"westernized\" Brazilians with non-Caucasian phenotypes; or people with known non-European ancestry was equal to that of Brazilian elites.\n\nThe largest white population in Latin America is in Brazil, with 91 million whites out of 190.7 million total Brazilians, or 47.7% of the total population, as of the 2010 census. Brazil's southern region contains the highest concentration, at 79% of the population. Argentina also contains a large numbers of whites. In terms of percentage of the total population, Uruguay, Argentina, and Costa Rica have the highest concentrations of whites, who constitute 80–90% of their total populations. The smallest concentration is in Honduras, with only 1%.\n\nWhite Mexicans are for the most part descendants of Spanish immigrants who arrived mainly from northern regions of Spain such as Cantabria, Navarra, Galicia and the Basque Country, however in the 19th and 20th century many non-Iberian immigrants arrived to the country, either motivated by economic opportunity (Americans, Canadians, English), government programs (Italians, Irish, Germans) or political motives such as the French during the Second Mexican Empire. In the 20th century international political instability was a key factor to drive immigration to Mexico, in this era Greeks, Romanians, Portuguese, Armenians, Poles, Russians, Lebanese, Palestinians and Jews, along with many Spanish refugees fleeing the Spanish Civil War, also settled in Mexico whereas in the 21st century, due to Mexico's economic growth, immigration from Europe has increased (mainly France and Spain), people from the United States have arrived as well, nowadays making up more than three-quarters of Mexico's roughly one million legal migrants. In that time, more people from the United States have been added to the population of Mexico than Mexicans to that of the United States, according to government data in both nations.\n\nMexico's northern and western regions have the highest percentages of European population, according to the American historian Howard F. Cline the majority of Mexicans in these regions have no native admixture and their aspect resemble that of northern Spaniards. In the north and west of Mexico, the indigenous tribes were substantially smaller than those found in central and southern Mexico, and also much less organized, thus they remained isolated from the rest of the population or even in some cases were hostile towards Mexican colonists. Because of this, Europeans often were the most numerous ethnic group within colonial cities in northern and western Mexico (albeit this trend is also seen in large central Mexican cities such as Mexico City) and became the regions with the highest proportion of whites during the Spanish colonial period. However, recent immigrants from southern Mexico have been changing, to some degree, its demographic trends.\n\nEstimates of Mexico's white population differ greatly in both, methodology and percentages given, extra-official sources such as the World factbook and Encyclopædia Britannica, which use the 1921 census results as the base of their estimations calculate Mexico's White population as only 9% or between one tenth to one fifth (the results of the 1921 census, however, have been contested by various historians and deemed inaccurate). Surveys that account for phenotypical traits and have performed actual field research suggest rather higher percentages: using the presence of blond hair as reference to classify a Mexican as white, the Metropolitan Autonomous University of Mexico calculated the percentage of said ethnic group at 23%. With a similar methodology, the American Sociological Association obtained a percentage of 18.8% having its higher frequency on the North region (22.3%–23.9%) followed by the Center region (18.4%–21.3%) and the South region (11.9%). Another study made by the University College London in collaboration with Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History found that the frequencies of blond hair and light eyes in Mexicans are of 18% and 28% respectively, surveys that use as reference skin color such as those made by Mexico's National Council to Prevent Discrimination and Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography reported a percentages of 47% in 2010 and 49% in 2017 respectivelly. Another survey published in 2018 reported a percentage significativelly lower at 29%, this time however, the surveying of Mexicans from \"vulnerable groups\" was prioritized, which among other measures meant that states known to have high numbers of people from said groups surveyed more people.\n\nA study performed in hospitals of Mexico City reported that an average 51.8% of Mexican newborns presented the congenital skin birthmark known as the Mongolian spot whilst it was absent in 48.2% of the analyzed babies. The Mongolian spot appears with a very high frequency (85-95%) in Asian, Native American, and African children. The skin lesion reportedly almost always appears on South American and Mexican children who are racially Mestizos, while having a very low frequency (5–10%) in Caucasian children. According to the Mexican Social Security Institute (shortened as IMSS) nationwide, around half of Mexican babies have the Mongolian spot.\n\nWhile according to the 1921 census only 9.8% of the Mexican population self-identified as white in modern genetic studies Mexico consistently shows a European admixture comparable to countries whose white populations reportedly range from 52%  to 77% such as Chile, (which reports a European genetic admixture of around 51%) and Costa Rica (which reports a European admixture of around 60%). Studies of the general Mexican population have found percentages with European ancestry of 56% 60%, 64%, and 78%. Various authors assert that the reason for said discrepancies may lie in the \"mestizaje\" ideology promoted by the Mexican government at the time, which asserted that all Mexicans who didn't speak indigenous languages were \"Mestizos\" with no exception, thus leading white Mexicans to be identified as Mestizos. The \"mestizaje\" ideology was completely installed in 1930, thus the white category disappeared from Mexican censuses.\n\nThe aforementioned ideology has blurred the lines of race at an institutional level and has also had a significative influence in genetic studies done in Mexico: As the criteria used in studies to determine if a Mexican is Mestizo or indigenous often lies in cultural traits such as the language spoken instead of racial self-identification or a phenotype-based selection there are studies on which populations who are considered to be Indigenous per virtue of the language spoken such as Nahua peoples from the state of Veracruz (located in central Mexico) show a higher degree of European genetic admixture than the one populations considered to be Mestizo report in other studies. The opposite also happens, as there instances on which populations considered to be Mestizo show genetic frequencies very similar to continental European peoples in the case of Mestizos from the state of Durango (located in northern Mexico) or to European derived Americans in the case of Mestizos from the state of Jalisco (located in western Mexico).\n\nA 2012 study published by the Journal of Human Genetics found the ancestry of the Mexican mestizo population to be predominantly European (64.9%), followed by Native American (30.8%) and African (4.2%). Those with European ancestry were most prevalent in the north and west (66.7–95%), with Native American ancestry in the center and southeast (37–50%), and with African ancestry being evenly distributed throughout (0–8.8%). The states that participated in this study were Aguascalientes, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Durango, Guerrero, Jalisco, Oaxaca, Sinaloa, Veracruz and Yucatan.\n\nAnother study, conducted by Mexico's National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN), reported that mestizo Mexicans were 58.96% European, 35.05% \"Asian\" (Amerindian mostly), and 5.03% African. Those in Sonora had the highest percentage of European ancestry (70.63%) and in Guerrero the lowest (51.98%), those in Guerrero also having shown the highest Asian percentage (37.17%). The African percentages ranged from 2.8%, in Sonora, to 11.13%, in Veracruz. 80% of the Mexican population was classed as mestizo (defined as \"being racially mixed in some degree\"). The study was conducted with volunteers from 6 states (Sonora, Zacatecas, Veracruz, Guanajuato, Oaxaca, and Yucatan) and an indigenous group known as Zapotecs.\n\nThe same study found that the haplogroup of Mexico's population was most similar to that of Europeans, with the percentage of haplotypes shared being 81%, followed by the Asian haplogroup, at 74%, and finally the African haplogroup, at 64%. Investigators noted that the African admixture in general did not come from the African slaves brought by the Europeans, but was already part of the genetic makeup of the colonizers themselves. Another study, of people in Mexico city, found the Mexican mestizo population—where individuals tend to be either predominantly European or Amerindian rather than tending toward an average—to be the one which shows the largest variation out of all the mestizo groups of Latin America. The results of this study are similar to the ones made by INMEGEN, with European admixture averaging 56.8%, followed by Asian (Native American) at 39.8% and African at 3.4%. Additional studies suggests a higher European admixture correlates with higher socioeconomic status, and a higher Amerindian ancestry with lower: a study exclusively of low-income Mexicans found the mean admixture to be 59%, 34.8%, and 6.2% for Amerindian, European, and African respectively, while a study made on Mexicans whose income was higher than the mean found their European admixture to be 81%. Besides socioeconomic factors, it has been observed that European ancestry varies significativelly depending of the Mexican region that is analyzed, with it being the dominant ancestry in northern and western Mexico. Said increase however, is not progressive as European ancestry peaks in the inner-northern regions of Mexico, where states such as Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí and Nuevo León report an average of 78%. Conversely, in towns and cities near the Mexico-United States border Native American and African ancestry have a notorious resurgence.\n\nWhite people in Cuba make up 64.1% of the total population, according to the 2012 census, with the majority being of diverse Spanish descent. However, after the mass exodus resulting from the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the number of white Cubans actually residing in Cuba diminished. Today, the various records that claim to show the percentage of whites in Cuba are conflicting and uncertain; some reports (usually coming from Cuba) still report a similar-to-pre-1959 number of 65%, and others (usually from outside observers) report 40–45%. Despite most white Cubans being of Spanish descent, many others are of French, Portuguese, German, Italian, or Russian descent. During the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, large waves of Canarians, Catalans, Andalusians, Castilians, and Galicians immigrated to Cuba. Between 1901 and 1958, more than a million Spaniards arrived in Cuba from Spain; many of these and their descendants left after Castro's Communist regime took power. One further significant ethnic influx was from various Middle Eastern nations. Many Jews have also immigrated there, some of them Sephardic.\n\nAn autosomal study from 2014 found the genetic makeup in Cuba to be 72% European, 20% African, and 8% Native American with different proportions depending on the self-reported ancestry (White, Mulatto or Mestizo, and Black). According to this study Whites are on average 86% European, 6.7% African and 7.8% Native American with European ancestry ranging from 65% to 99%. 75% of whites are over 80% European and 50% are over 88% European According to a study in 2011 Whites are on average 5.8% African with African ancestry ranging from 0% to 13%. 75% of whites are under 8% African and 50% are under 5% African A study from 2009 analysed the genetic structure of the three principal ethnic groups from Havana City (209 individuals), and the contribution of parental populations to its genetic pool. A contribution from Indigenous peoples of the Americas was not detectable in the studied sample.\n\nThe 1750 estimates show that there were 30,863 whites, out of a total population of 70,625, in the colony of Santo Domingo. The census of 1920 was the first national enumeration. The second census, taken in 1935, covered race, religion, literacy, nationality, labor force, and urban–rural residence.\n\nAccording to the CIA World Factbook, white persons in the Dominican Republic are 16% of the total population, with the vast majority being of Spanish descent. Notable other ancestries includes French, Italian, Lebanese, German, and Portuguese.\n\nThe government of Rafael Leónidas Trujillo made a point of increasing the white population, or \"whitening\" the racial composition of the country, by rejecting black immigrants from Haiti and local blacks as foreigners. He also welcomed Jewish refugees in 1938 and Spanish farmers in the 1950s as part of this plan. The country's German minority is the largest in the Caribbean.\n\nThe white and the mulatto population of Haiti make up about 5% of its population, while 95% is \"black\".\n\nThat 5% minority group comprises people of many different ethnic and national backgrounds, who are French, Spanish, Middle Eastern, Portuguese, Russian, Dutch, Swiss, Armenian, Poles (Polish legion), Jews (arriving from the Polish legion and during the Holocaust), Germans (18th century and World War I), and Italian.\n\nWhite people in Martinique represent 5% of the population. As Martinique is an overseas French department, most whites are French.\n\nAn early Census on the island was conducted by Governor Francisco Manuel de Lando in 1530. An exhaustive 1765 census was taken by Lieutenant General Alexander O'Reilly, which, according to some sources, showed 17,572 whites out of a total population of 44,883. The censuses from 1765 to 1887 were taken by the Spanish government who conducted them at irregular intervals. The 1899 census was taken by the United States War Department. Since 1910, Puerto Rico has been included in every decennial census taken by the United States.\n\nWhite Puerto Ricans of European, mostly Spanish, descent are said to comprise the majority, with 75.8% of the population identifying as white. In 1899, one year after the U.S invaded and took control of the island, 61.8% identified as white. In 2000, for the first time in fifty years, the census asked people to define their race and found the percentage of whites had risen to 80.5% (3,064,862); not because there has been an influx of whites to the island (or an exodus of non-White people), but a change of race perceptions, mainly because Puerto Rican elites wished to portray Puerto Rico as the \"white island of the Antilles\", partly as a response to scientific racism.\n\nFrom the beginning of the 20th century, American observers remarked on the \"surprising preponderance of the white race\" on the island. One travel writer called Puerto Rico \"the whitest of the Antilles\". In a widely distributed piece, a geologist wrote that the island was \"notable among the West Indian group for the reason that its preponderant population is of the white race\". In a more academic book he reiterated that \"Porto Rico, at least, has not become Africanized\".\n\nDuring the 19th century, hundreds of Corsican, French, Middle Eastern, and Portuguese families, along with large numbers of immigrants from Spain (mainly from Catalonia, Asturias, Galicia, the Balearic Islands, Andalusia, and the Canary Islands) and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain's former colonies in South America, arrived in Puerto Rico. Other settlers have included Irish, Scots, Germans, and Italians. Thousands of immigrants were granted land from Spain during the \"Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815\" (Royal Decree of Graces of 1815), which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with a certain amount of free land.\n\nAccording to a genetic research by the University of Brasilia, Puerto Rican genetic admixture consists in a 60.3% European, 26.4% African, and 13.2% Amerindian ancestry.\n\nMost of the population in Saint Barthélemy are French-speaking descendants of the first settlers from Normandy and Brittany.\n\nFrom the late 19th century to when the Panama Canal opened, European migrants used Costa Rica to get across the isthmus of Central America to reach the west coast of the United States (California).\n\nIn Costa Rica, estimates of the percentage of white people vary between 77% and 82%, or about 3.1–3.5 million people. The white and mestizo populations combined equal 83%, according to the CIA World Factbook. Costa Rican European ancestry is mostly Spanish, although a significant number is descended from Italian, Greek, German, English, Dutch, French, Irish, Portuguese, Lebanese, or Polish families. Other ethnic groups include Russians, Danes, Belgians, Croats, Hungarians, Turks, Armenians and Georgians.\n\nMany of the first Spanish colonists in Costa Rica may have been Jewish converts to Christianity who were expelled from Spain in 1492 and fled to colonial backwaters to avoid the Inquisition. The first sizable group of self-identified Jews immigrated from Poland, beginning in 1929. From the 1930s to the early 1950s, journalistic and official anti-Semitic campaigns fueled harassment of Jews; however, by the 1950s and 1960s, the immigrants won greater acceptance. Most of the 3,500 Costa Rican Jews today are not highly observant, but they remain largely endogamous.\n\nAccording to the official 2007 Census in El Salvador, 12.7% of Salvadorans identified with being white.\n\nAccording to genetic research by the University of Brasilia, Salvadoran genetic admixture shows an average of 45.2% Amerindian, 45.2% European, and 9.7% African ancestry.\n\nA 2010-2012 national study estimated that white Guatemalans are 18.5% of the population (2.7 million), with the majority descendants of Germans, followed those of Spaniards, French, Italians, English, Swedish, Belgian, Swiss, Danish, Norwegian, Dutch, Russian, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, and other parts of Europe. There are also descendants of Americans, Canadians, and whites from Latin American nations such as Argentina and Costa Rica.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Guatemala had massive immigration from Germany, Belgium, and Italy, as well as, to a lesser extent, Spain, France, Great Britain, Denmark, Switzerland, Netherlands, Scandinavian countries, Ireland, and other European countries. From the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth, immigration from Russia, Poland, and Greece was encouraged by grants of land for coffee fincas and vineyards in the areas of Cobán, Zacapa, Guatemala City, Quetzaltenango, Chiquimula, El Progreso, and other places.\n\nBy 1940, the percentage of Guatemalans of European origin had reached 29%, becoming the majority in the capital and in the east, with significant populations in Verapaces, Quetzaltenango, and several areas in the southwest. But by 1980, with a fall-off of European immigration, and a significant increase in indigenous and mestizo families, that figure had fallen to 13%. Later, after armed conflict that destroyed many non-white families, the percentage had risen, as well as that of castizos (mixture of the mestizo population and European descent) and mestizos with European predominance.\n\nAccording to a 2014 research published in the journal \"Genetics and Molecular Biology\" and to a 2010 research published in the journal \"Physical Antropology\", European ancestry predominates in 69% of Nicaraguans, followed by African ancestry in 20%, and lastly Native American ancestry in 11%, making Nicaragua the country with the highest proportion of European ancestry in Central America. Non-genetic data from the \"CIA World Factbook\" establish that from Nicaragua's 2016 population of 5,966,798, around 69% are mestizo, 17% white, 5% Native American, and 9% black and other races. This fluctuates with changes in migration patterns. The population is 58% urban . Nicaraguan white are mainly of Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, Belgian, and French ancestry.\n\nIn the 19th century, Nicaragua experienced a wave of immigration, primarily from Europe. In particular, families from Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and Belgium moved to Nicaragua to set up businesses with money they brought from Europe. They established many agricultural businesses, such as coffee and sugarcane plantations, as well as newspapers, hotels, and banks.\n\nThere is also a small Middle Eastern–Nicaraguan community of Syrian, Armenian, Palestinian, Jewish, and Lebanese people in Nicaragua, with a total population of about 30,000.\n\nWhite Panamanians are 10% of the population, with those of Spanish ancestry being in the majority. Other ancestries includes Dutch, English, French, German, Swiss, Danish, Irish, Greek, Italian, Lebanese, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian. There is also a sizable and influential Jewish community.\n\nHonduras contains perhaps the smallest percentage of whites in Latin America, with only about 1% (about 89,000) of the total population being classified in this group. \n\nThe ancestry of Argentines is mostly European, with both Native American and African contributions. A 2009 autosomal DNA study found the Argentine population to average 78.5 percent European, 17.3 percent Native American, and 4.2 percent sub-Saharan African. A 2012 autosomal DNA study found the genetic composition of Argentines to be 65% European, 31% Native American, and 4% African.\n\nArgentina's National Institute of Statistics and Censuses (INDEC) does not conduct ethnic/racial censuses; so, no official data exist on the percentage of white Argentines today. Nevertheless, various sources estimate the white population of European descent to be between 85% and 86.4%. These figures increase to between 86.1% and 89.7% if non-European Caucasian groups (such as Jews, Lebanese, Armenians, and other Middle Easterners) are also counted. These percentages show an estimated population of 34-36 million white people in Argentina.\n\nWhite Argentines are dispersed throughout the country, but their greatest concentration is in the east-central region of Pampas, the southern region of Patagonia, and in the west-central region of Cuyo. Their concentration is smaller in the north-eastern region of Litoral, and is much smaller in the north-western provinces of Salta, Jujuy, Tucumán, Catamarca, La Rioja, and Santiago del Estero, which was the most densely populated region of the country (mainly by Amerindian and Mestizo people) before the wave of immigration of 1857-1940 and was the area where European newcomers settled the least. During the last few decades, due to internal migration from the northern provinces—as well as to immigration from Bolivia, Peru, and Paraguay—the percentage of white Argentines in certain areas of Greater Buenos Aires and the provinces of Salta and Jujuy has decreased significantly.\n\nThe white population residing in Argentina is mostly descended from immigrants who arrived from Europe and the Middle East between the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with a smaller proportion from Spaniards of the colonial period. From 1506 to 1650—according to M. Möner, Peter Muschamp, and Boyd-Bowman—out of a total of 437,669 Spaniards who settled in the American Spanish colonies, between 10,500 and 13,125 \"Peninsulares\" settled in the Río de la Plata region. The colonial censuses conducted after the creation of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata showed that the proportion of Spaniards and Criollos was significant in the cities and surrounding countryside, but not so much in the rural areas. The 1778 census of Buenos Aires, ordered by Viceroy Juan José de Vértiz, revealed that, of a total population of 37,130 inhabitants (in both the city and surrounding countryside), the Spaniards and Criollos numbered 25,451, or 68.55% of the total. Another census, carried out in the Corregimiento de Cuyo in 1777, showed that the Spaniards and Criollos numbered 4,491 (or 51.24%) out of a population of 8,765 inhabitants. In Córdoba (city and countryside) the Spanish/Criollo people comprised a 39.36% (about 14,170) of 36,000 inhabitants.\n\nData provided by Argentina's \"Dirección Nacional de Migraciones\" (National Bureau of Migrations) states that the country received a total 6,611,000 European and Middle Eastern immigrants during the period from 1857 to 1940. The main immigrant group was 2,970,000 Italians (44.9% of the total), who came initially from Piedmont, Veneto, and Lombardy, and later from Campania, Calabria, and Sicily. The second group in importance was Spaniards, some 2,080,000 (31.4% of the total), who were mostly Galicians and Basques, but also Asturians, Cantabrians, Catalans, and Andalucians. In smaller but significant numbers came Frenchmen from Occitania (239,000, 3.6% of the total) and Poles (180,000 – 2.7%). From the Russian Empire came some 177,000 people (2.6%), who were not only ethnic Russians, but also Ukrainians, Belarusians, Volga Germans, Lithuanians, etc. From the Ottoman Empire the contribution was mainly Armenians, Lebanese, and Syrians, some 174,000 in all (2.6%). Then come the immigrants from the German Empire, some 152,000 (2.2%). From the Austro-Hungarian Empire came 111,000 people (1.6%), among them Austríans, Hungarians, Croatians, Bosniaks, Serbs, Ruthenians, and Montenegrins. 75,000 immigrants came from what was then the UK, of these the majority were Irish who were escaping the potato famine or British rule. Other minor groups were the Portuguese (65,000), Slavic peoples from Yugoslavia (48,000), the Swiss (44,000), Belgians (26,000), Danes (18,000), white Americans (12,000), the Dutch (10,000), and the Swedish (7,000). Even colonists from Australia, and Boers from South Africa, can be found in the Argentine immigration records.\n\nIn the 1910s, when immigration reached its peak, more than 30% of Argentina's population had been born in Europe, and over half of the population of the city of Buenos Aires had been born abroad. According to the 1914 national census, 80% out of a total population of 7,903,662 were people who were either European, or the children and grandchildren of same. Among the remaining 20% (the descendants of the population previous to the immigratory wave), about one third were white. That makes for 86.6%, or about 6.8 million whites residing in Argentina. European immigration continued to account for over half the population growth during the 1920s, and for smaller percentages after World War II, many Europeans migrating to Argentina after the great conflict to escape hunger and destitution. According to Argentine records, 392,603 people from the Old World entered the country in the 1940s. In the following decade, the flow diminished because the Marshall Plan improved Europe's economy, and emigration was not such a necessity; but even then, between 1951 and 1970 another 256,252 Europeans entered Argentina. From the 1960s—when whites were 76.1% of the total—onward, increasing immigration from countries on Argentina's northern border (Bolivia, Peru, and Paraguay) significantly increased the process of Mestizaje in certain areas of Argentina, especially Greater Buenos Aires, because those countries have Amerindian and Mestizo majorities.\n\nIn 1992, after the fall of the Communist regimes of the Soviet Union and its allies, the governments of Western Europe were worried about a possible mass exodus from Central Europe and Russia. President Carlos Menem offered to receive part of that emigratory wave in Argentina. On December 19, 1994, Resolution 4632/94 was enacted, allowing \"special treatment\" for applicants who wished to emigrate from the republics of the ex-Soviet Union. From January 1994 until December 2000, a total 9,399 Central and Eastern Europeans traveled and settled in Argentina. Of the total, 6,720 were Ukrainians (71.5%), 1,598 Russians (17%), 526 Romanians, Bulgarians, Armenians, Georgians, Moldovans, and Poles, and 555 (5.9%) traveled with a Soviet passport. 85% of the newcomers were under age 45 and 51% had tertiary-level education, so most of them integrated quite rapidly into Argentine society, although some had to work for lower wages than expected at the beginning.\n\nWhite people in Bolivia make up 5% of the nation's population. The white population consists mostly of \"criollos\", which consist of families of unmixed Spanish ancestry descended from the Spanish colonists and Spanish refugees fleeing the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War. These two groups have constituted much of the aristocracy since independence. Other groups within the white population are Germans, who founded the national airline Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano, as well as Italians, Americans, Basques, Lebanese, Croats, Russians, Polish, English, Irish, and other minorities, many of whose members descend from families that have lived in Bolivia for several generations.\n\nBrazil is one of the few countries in Latin America that includes racial categories in its censuses: \"Branco\" (White), \"Negro\" (Black), \"Pardo\" (Multiracial), \"Amarelo\" (Yellow) and \"Indígena\" (Amerindian), with categorization being by self-identification. Taking into account the data provided by the last National Household Survey, conducted in 2010, Brazil would possess the most numerous white population in Latin America, given that a 47.7% – 91 million people – of Brazilians self-declared as \"Brancos\". Comparing this survey with previous censuses, a slow but constant decrease in the percentage of self-identified white Brazilians can be seen: in the 2000 Census it was 53.7%, in the 2006 Household Survey it was 49.9%, and in the last, 2008, survey it decreased to the current 48.4%. Some analysts believe that this decrease is evidence that more Brazilians have come to appreciate their mixed ancestry, re-classifying themselves as \"Pardos\". Furthermore, some demographers estimate that a 9% of the self-declared white Brazilians have a certain degree of African and Amerindian ancestry, which, if the \"one-drop rule\" were applied, would classify them as \"Pardos\".\n\nThe white Brazilian population is spread throughout the country, but it is concentrated in the four southernmost states, where 79.8% of the population self-identify as white. The states with the highest percentage of white people are Santa Catarina (86.9%), Rio Grande do Sul (82.3%), Paraná (77.2%) and São Paulo (70.4%). Another five states that have significant proportions of whites are Rio de Janeiro (55.8%), Mato Grosso do Sul (51.7%), Espírito Santo (50.4%), Minas Gerais (47.2%) and Goiás (43.6%). São Paulo has the largest population in absolute numbers with 30 million whites.\n\nIn the 18th century, an estimated 600,000 Portuguese arrived, including wealthy immigrants, as well as poor peasants, attracted by the Brazil Gold Rush in Minas Gerais. By the time of Brazilian independence, declared by emperor Pedro I in 1822, an estimated 600,000 to 800,000 Europeans had come to Brazil, most of them male settlers from Portugal. Rich immigrants who established the first sugarcane plantations in Pernambuco and Bahia, and New Christians and Gypsies fleeing from religious persecution, were among the early settlers.\n\nAfter independence, Brazil saw several campaigns to attract European immigrants, which were prompted by a policy of \"Branqueamento\" (Whitening). During the 19th century, the slave labor force was gradually replaced by European immigrants, especially Italians. This mostly took place after 1850, as a result of the end of the slave trade in the Atlantic Ocean and the growth of coffee plantations in the São Paulo region. European immigration was at its peak between the mid-19th and the mid-20th centuries, when nearly five million Europeans immigrated to Brazil, most of them Italians (58.5%), Portuguese (20%), Germans, Spaniards, Poles, Lithuanians, and Ukrainians. Between 1877 and 1903, 1,927,992 immigrants entered Brazil, an average of 71,000 people per year, with the peak year being 1891, when 215,239 Europeans arrived.\n\nAfter the First World War, the Portuguese once more became the main immigrant group, and Italians fell to third place. Spanish immigrants rose to second place because of the poverty that was affecting millions of rural workers. Germans were fourth place on the list; they arrived especially during the Weimar Republic, due to poverty and unemployment caused by the First World War. The numbers of Europeans of other ethnicities increased; among them were people from Poland, Russia, and Romania, who emigrated in the 1920s, probably because of politic persecution. Other peoples emigrated from the Middle East, especially from what now are Syria and Lebanon. During the period 1821–1932, Brazil received an estimated 4,431,000 European immigrants.\n\nAfter the end of the Second World War, European immigration diminished significantly, although between 1931 and 1963 1.1 million immigrants entered Brazil, mostly Portuguese. By the mid-1970s, many Portuguese had immigrated to Brazil after the independence of Portugal's African colonies—from Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. Some came from Macao, because of the dictatorship there.\n\nA 2015 autosomal genetic study, which also analysed data of 25 studies of 38 different Brazilian populations, concluded that 62% of the population is of predominantly European ancestry, followed by African (21%) and Native American (17%). European predominance is highest in Southern Brazil (77%), African highest in Northeast Brazil (27%), and Native American highest in Northern Brazil (32%).\n\nAn autosomal study from 2013, of nearly 1,300 samples from all regions of Brazil, found predominantly European ancestry, combined with African and Native American contributions in varying degrees:\n\nFollowing an increasing North to South gradient, European ancestry was the most prevalent in all urban populations (with values up to 74%). The populations in the North consisted of a significant proportion of Native American ancestry that was about two times higher than the African contribution. Conversely, in the Northeast, Center-West and Southeast, African ancestry was the second most prevalent. At an intrapopulation level, all urban populations were highly admixed, and most of the variation in ancestry proportions was observed between individuals within each population rather than among population.\n\nAccording to an autosomal DNA study conducted in 2011—of nearly 1000 white, pardo, and black samples proportional to population—European ancestry is predominant in all regions of Brazil, with African and Native American contributions. According to this study, European ancestry accounts for 70% of the population. This study verified that Brazilians from different regions are genetically more homogenous than some expected. The 2011 autosomal study samples came from blood donors (the lowest classes constituting the great majority of blood donors in Brazil), as well as public health personnel and students.\n\nAccording to a DNA study from 2010,\n\na new portrayal of each ethnicity contribution to the DNA of Brazilians, obtained with samples from the five regions of the country, has indicated that, on average, European ancestors are responsible for nearly 80% of the genetic heritage of the population. The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%.\n\nThe results, published by the scientific magazine \"American Journal of Human Biology\" by a team of the Catholic University of Brasília, show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as skin, eye, and hair colour have little to do with the genetic makeup (regardless of census classification) of each person, as has been shown in previous studies.\n\nAncestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bio-anthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.\n\nIt is important to note that \"the samples came from free of charge paternity test takers\". Thus, as the researchers make explicit, \"the paternity tests were free of charge, the population samples involved people of various socioeconomic strata, although \"likely to be leaning slightly towards the \"pardo\" group\".\n\nAn autosomal DNA study from 2009 found a similar profile: \"all the Brazilian samples (regions) lie more closely to the European group than to the African populations or to the Mestizos from Mexico\".\n\nAccording to an autosomal genetic study by the University of Brasilia, in 2008, the composition of Brazil is about 65% European, 25% African, and 9% Native American.\n\nSão Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil, with about 40 million people, showed the following composition, according to an autosomal study from 2006: European genes account for 79% of the heritage of the people of São Paulo, 14% are of African origin, and 7% Native American. A more recent study, from 2013, found the following composition in São Paulo state: 61.9% European, 25.5% African and 11.6% Native American.\n\nA genetic study presented by the Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research found that, on average, \"white\" Brazilians have >70% European genomic ancestry, whereas \"black\" Brazilians have 37.1% European ancestry. It concluded that \"The high ancestral variability observed in whites and blacks suggests that each Brazilian has a singular and quite individual proportion of European, African and Amerindian ancestry in his/her mosaic genomes. Thus, the only possible basis to deal with genetic variation in Brazilians is not by considering them as members of colour groups, but on a person-by-person basis, as 190 million human beings, with singular genome and life histories\".\n\nA 2015 autosomal DNA study found Chile to be 55.16% European, 42.38% Native American and 2.44% African, using LAMP-LD modeling; and 54.38% European, 43.22% Native American, and 2.40% African, using RFMix. An autosomal DNA study from 2014 found the results to be 51.85% (± 5.44%) European, 44.34% (± 3.9%) Native American, and 3.81% (± 0.45%) African.\n\nStudies estimates the white population at 20%, to 52.7% of the Chilean population. According to genetic research by the University of Brasilia, Chilean genetic admixture consists of 51.6% European, 42.1% Amerindian, and 6.3% African ancestry. According to an autosomal genetic study of 2014 carried out among soldiers in the city of Arica, Northern Chile, the European admixture goes from 56.8% in soldiers born in Magallanes to 41.2% for the ones who were born in Tarapacá. According to a study from 2013, conducted by the \"Candela Project\" in Northern Chile as well, the genetic admixture of Chile is 52% European, 44% Native American, and 4% African.\n\nAccording to a study performed in 2014, 37.9% of Chileans self-identified as white, a subsequent DNA tests showed that the average self identifying white was genetically 54% European.\n\nGenotype and phenotype in Chileans vary according to social class. 13% of lower-class Chileans have at least one non-Hispanic European surname, compared to 72% of those who belong to the upper-middle-class. Phenotypically, only 9.6% of lower-class girls have light-colored eyes—either green or blue—where 31.6% of upper-middle class girls have such eyes. Blonde hair is present in 2.2% and 21.3%, of lower-class and upper-middle girls respectively, whilst black hair is more common among lower-class girls (24.5%) than upper-middle class ones (9.0%).\n\nChile was usually an unattractive place for migrants, simply because it was far from Europe and relatively difficult to reach. However, during the 18th century an important flux of emigrants from Spain populated Chile. They were mostly Basques, who vitalized the economy and rose rapidly in the social hierarchy, becoming part of the political elite that still dominates the country. An estimated 1.6 million (10%) to 3.2 million (20%) Chileans have a surname (one or both) of Basque origin. The Basques liked Chile because of its similarity to their native land: cool climate, with similar geography, fruits, seafood, and wine.\n\nThe Spanish was the most significant European immigration to Chile, although there was never a massive immigration, such as happened in neighboring Argentina and Uruguay, and, therefore, the Chilean population wasn't \"whitened\" to the same extent. However, it is undeniable that immigrants have played a role in Chilean society. Between 1851 and 1924, Chile received only 0.5% of the total European immigration to Latin America, compared to 46% for Argentina, 33% for Brazil, 14% for Cuba, and 4% for Uruguay. This was because such migrants came across the Atlantic, not the Pacific, and before the construction of the Panama Canal, Europeans preferring to settle in countries close to their homelands, instead of taking the long route through the Straits of Magellan or across the Andes. In 1907, the European-born reached a peak of 2.4% of the Chilean population, decreasing to 1.8% in 1920, and 1.5% in 1930.\n\nIt is estimated that nearly 5% of the Chilean population is of Asian descent, chiefly from the Middle East—i.e., Jews/Israelis, Palestinians, Syrians, and Lebanese—totaling about 800,000. Chile is home to a large population of immigrants, mostly Christian, from the Levant. Roughly 500,000 Palestinian descendants are believed to reside in Chile.\n\nAbout 5% of the Chilean population has some French ancestry. Over 700,000 (4.5%) Chileans may be of British (English, Scottish and Welsh) or Irish origin. Another significant immigrant group is Croatian. The number of their descendants today is estimated to be 380,000, or 2.4% of the population. Other authors claim that close to 4.6% of the Chilean population must have some Croatian ancestry.\n\nAfter the failed liberal revolution of 1848 in the German states, a significant German immigration took place, laying the foundation for the German-Chilean community. Sponsored by the Chilean government, to \"unbarbarize\" and colonize the southern region, these Germans (including German-speaking Swiss, Silesians, Alsatians and Austrians) settled mainly in Valdivia, Llanquihue, Chiloé, and Los Ángeles. The Chilean Embassy in Germany estimated that 150,000 to 200,000 Chileans are of German origin.\n\n184,000 are descendants of Italians. Chileans of Greek descent are estimated to number 90,000 to 120,000, most of them living in the Santiago or the Antofagasta areas, Chile being one of the top 5 countries in terms of number of Greek descendants. The descendants of the Swiss number 90,000 Other groups of European descendants are found in smaller numbers.\n\nThe proportion of the Colombian population with primarily European ancestry is estimated at approximately 20%, but in the 2005 Census, 37% of the total population self-identified as white. According to genetic research by the University of Brasilia, Colombian genetic admixture indicates 45.9% European, 33.8% Amerindian, and 20.3% African ancestry.\n\nWithin 100 years after the first Spanish settlement, nearly 95 percent of all Native Americans in Colombia had died. The majority of the deaths of Native Americans were the cause of diseases such as measles and smallpox, which were spread by European settlers. Many Native Americans were also killed by armed conflicts with European settlers.\n\nWhite Colombians are mostly descendants of Spaniards, although Italian, German, Irish, Portuguese, Slavic, and Lebanese Colombians are found in significant numbers. Many Spanish colonists came searching for gold, while other Spaniards established themselves as leaders of social organizations teaching natives the Christian faith and the ways of European civilization. Catholic priests provided education for Native Americans that otherwise was unavailable.\n\nBetween 1540 and 1559, 8.9 percent of the residents of Colombia were of Basque origin. It has been suggested that the present day incidence of business entrepreneurship in the region of Antioquia is attributable to the Basque immigration and character traits. Today many Colombians of the Department of Antioquia region preserve their Basque ethnic heritage. In Bogota, there is a small district/colonies of Basque families who emigrated as a consequence of Spain's Civil War or because of better opportunities. Basque priests were the ones that introduced handball into Colombia. Basque immigrants in Colombia were devoted to teaching and public administration. In the first years of the Andean Multinational Company, Basque sailors navigated as captains and pilots on the majority of the ships until the country was able to train its own crews.\n\nThe first and largest wave of immigration from the Middle East began around 1880, and continued during the first two decades of the twentieth century. The immigrants were mainly Maronite Christians from Greater Syria (Syria and Lebanon) and Palestine, fleeing those then Ottoman territories. Syrians, Palestinians, and Lebanese have continued to settle in Colombia. Due to a lack of information, it is impossible to know the exact number of Lebanese and Syrians that immigrated to Colombia; but for 1880 to 1930, 5,000–10,000 is estimated. Syrians and Lebanese are perhaps the biggest immigrant group next to the Spanish since independence. Those who left their homeland in the Middle East to settle in Colombia left for different religious, economic, and political reasons. In 1945, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Cali, and Bogota are the cities with the largest numbers of Arabic-speakers in Colombia. The Arabs that went to Maicao were mostly Sunni Muslim, with some Druze and Shiites, as well as Orthodox and Maronite Christians. The mosque of Maicao is the second largest mosque in Latin America. Middle Easterns are generally called \"Turcos\" (Turkish).\n\nIn December 1941 the United States government estimated that there were 4,000 Germans living in Colombia. There were some Nazi agitators in Colombia, such as Barranquilla businessman Emil Prufurt. Colombia invited Germans who were on the U.S. blacklist to leave. SCADTA, a Colombian-German air transport corporation, which was established by German expatriates in 1919, was the first commercial airline in the western hemisphere. In recent years, the celebration of Colombian-German heritage has grown increasingly popular in Bogota, Cartagena, and Bucaramanga. There are many annual festivals that focus German cuisine, specially pastry arts and beer. Since 2009, there has been a considerable increase in collaborative research through advanced business and educational exchanges, such as those promoted by COLCIENCIAS and AIESEC. There are many Colombian-German companies focused on finance, science, education, technology and innovation, and engineering.\n\nAccording to the 2010 National Population Census, 6.1% of the population self-identified as white, down from 10.5% in 2001.\nIn Ecuador, being white is more an indication of social class than of ethnicity. Classifying oneself as white is often done to claim membership to the middle class and to distance oneself from the lower class, which is associated being \"Indian\". For this reason the status of \"blanco\" is claimed by people who are not primarily of European heritage. According to genetic research by the University of Brasilia, Ecuadorian genetic admixture indicates 64.6% Amerindian, 31.0% European, and 4.4% African ancestry.\n\nWhite Ecuadorians, mostly \"criollos\", are descendants of Spanish colonists and also Spanish refugees fleeing the 1936–1939 Spanish Civil War. Most still hold large amounts of lands, mainly in the northern \"Sierra\", and live in Quito or Guayaquil. There is also a large number of white people in Cuenca, a city in the southern Andes of Ecuador, due to the arrival of Frenchmen in the area, who came to measure the arc of the Earth. Cuenca, Loja, and the Galápagos attracted German immigration during the early 20th century. The Galápagos also had a small Norwegian fishing community until they were asked to leave. There are sizable populations of Italian, French, German, Basque, Portuguese, and Greek descent, as well as a small Ecuadorian Jewish population. Ecuador's Jews consists of Sephardic Jews arriving in the South of the country in the 16th and 17th centuries and Ashkenazi Jews during the 1930s in the main cities of Quito and Cuenca.\n\n12% of the population is white, mostly French.\n\nEthnically, culturally, and socially, Paraguay has one of the most homogeneous populations in South America. Because of José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia's 1814 policy that no white Spaniards and Europeans could intermarry among themselves (they could only marry blacks, mulattoes, mestizos or the native Guaraní), a measure taken to avoid a white majority occurring in Paraguay (De Francia believed that all men were equal as well), it was within little more than one generation that most of the population were of mixed racial origin.\n\nThe exact percentage of the white Paraguayan population is not known because the Paraguayan census does not include racial or ethnic identification, save for the indigenous population, which was 1.7% of the country's total in the 2002 census. Other sources estimate the sizes of other groups, the mestizo population being estimated at 95% by the CIA World Factbook, with all other groups totaling 5%. Thus, whites and the remaining groups (Asians, Afro-Paraguayans, others) make up approximately 3.3% of the total population. According to Lizcano, in 2005 a fifth of population or 20% are white and 75% approximately is mestizo. Such a reading is complicated, because, as elsewhere in Latin America, \"white\" and \"mestizo\" are not mutually exclusive (people may identify as both).\n\nDue to the European migration in the 19th and 20th centuries, the majority of whites are of German descent (including Mennonites), with others being of French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese descent. Many are southern and southeastern Brazilians (\"brasiguayos\"), as well as Argentines and Uruguayans, and their descendants. People from such regions are generally descendants of colonial settlers and/or more recent immigrants.\n\nIn 2005, 600 families of Volga Germans who migrated to Germany after the fall of the Soviet Union, re-migrated and established a new colony, \"Neufeld\", near Yuty (Caazapá Department), in southeastern Paraguay.\n\nAccording to the 2017 census 5.9% or 1.3 million people self-identified as white of the population who were aged 12 and above. This was the first time the census had asked an ancestral identity question. The highest proportion was in the La Libertad Region with 10% identifying as white. \nThey are descendants primarily of Spanish colonists, and also of Spanish refugees fleeing the Spanish Civil War. After World War II, many German refugees fled to Peru and settled in large cities, while others descend from Italian, French (mainly Basques), Austrian or German, Portuguese, British, Russians, Croats, Lebanese, Jordanian, and Syrian immigrant families. The majority of the whites live in the largest cities, and are concentrated in the northern coastal cities of Trujillo, Chiclayo, Piura, and of course the capital Lima. Cajamarca and San Martín Region, and the highlands of northwestern Peru, are also places with strong Spanish, and other European, influence and ethnic presence. The only southern city with a significant white population is Arequipa.\n\nAccording to a genetic research by the University of Brasilia, Peruvian genetic admixture indicates 73.0% Amerindian, 15.1% European, and 11.9% African ancestry.\n\nA 2009 DNA study in the \"American Journal of Human Biology\" showed the genetic composition of Uruguay as primarily European, with Native American ancestry ranging from one to 20 percent and sub-Saharan African from seven to 15 percent, depending on the region.\n\nBetween the mid-19th and the early 20th centuries, Uruguay received part of the same migratory influx as Argentina, although the process started a bit earlier. During 1850-1900, the country welcomed four waves of European immigrants, mainly Spaniards, Italians and Frenchmen. In smaller numbers came British, Germans, Swiss, Russians, Portuguese, Poles, Bulgarians, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Dutch, Belgians, Croatians, Lebanese, Armenians, Greeks, Scandinavians, and Irish. The demographic impact of these migratory waves was greater than in Argentina, Uruguay going from having 70,000 inhabitants in 1830, to 450,000 in 1875, and a million inhabitants by 1900, its population thus increasing fourteen-fold in only 70 years. Between 1840 and 1890, 50%–60% of Montevideo's population was born abroad, almost all in Europe. The Census conducted in 1860 showed that 35% of the country's population was made up by foreigners, although by the time of the 1908 Census this figure had dropped to 17%.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1997, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) of Uruguay conducted a Continuous Household Survey, of 40,000 homes, that included the topic of race in the country. Its results were based on \"the explicit statements of the interviewee about the race they consider they belong themselves\". These results were extrapolated, and the INE estimated that out of 2,790,600 inhabitants, some 2,602,200 were white (93.2%), some 164,200 (5.9%) were totally or partially black, some 12,100 were totally or partially Amerindian (0.4%), and the remaining 12,000 considered themselves Yellow.\n\nIn 2006, a new Enhanced National Household Survey touched on the topic again, but this time emphasizing ancestry, not race; the results revealed 5.8% more Uruguayans stated having total or partial black and/or Amerindian ancestry. This reduction in the percentage of self-declared \"pure whites\" between surveys could be caused by the phenomenon of the interviewee giving new value to their African heritage, similar to what has happened in Brazil in the last three censuses. Anyway, it is worth noting that 2,897,525 interviewées declared having only white ancestry (87.4%), 302,460 declared having total or partial black ancestry (9.1%), 106,368 total or partial Amerindian ancestry (2.9%) and 6,549 total or partial Yellow ancestry (0.2%). This figure matches external estimates for white population in Uruguay of 87.4%, 88%, or 90%.\n\nRecently many European and American immigrants have entered the country seeking peace and security, or escaping from the pollution and voracious tax systems in their countries of origin. In 1997, the Uruguayan government granted residence rights to only 200 European/American citizens; in 2008 the number of residence rights granted increased to 927.\n\nAccording to the official Venezuelan census, although \"white\" literally involves external issues such as light skin, shape and color of hair and eyes, among others, the term \"white\" has been used in different ways in different historical periods and places, and so its precise definition is somewhat confusing. For this reason, \"White Venezuelan\" is used to describe the Venezuelan citizen of European origin.\n\nAccording to the 2011 National Population and Housing Census, 43.6% of the population identified themselves as white people. A genomic study shows that about 60.6% of the Venezuelan gene pool has European origin. Among the Latin American countries in the study (Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Colombia, El Salvador, Ecuador, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela), Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, and Argentina exhibit the highest European contribution.\n\nThe Venezuelan gene pool indicates a 60.6% European, 23.0% Amerindian, and 16.3% African ancestry. Spaniards were introduced into Venezuela during the colonial period. Most of them were from Andalusia, Galicia, Basque Country and from the Canary Islands. Until the last years of World War II, a large part of European immigrants to Venezuela came from the Canary Islands, and their cultural impact was significant, influencing the development of Castilian in the country, its gastronomy and customs. With the beginning of oil production during the first decades of the 20th century, employees of oil companies from the United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands established themselves in Venezuela. Later, in the middle of the century, there was a new wave of immigrants originating from Spain (mainly from Galicia, Andalucia, and Basque country, some being refugees from the Spanish Civil War), Italy (mainly from southern Italy and the Veneto region), and Portugal (from Madeira), as well as from Germany, France, England, Croatia, the Netherlands, other European countries, and the Middle East (Lebanon), encouraged by a welcoming immigration policy to a prosperous, rapidly developing country where educated and skilled immigrants were needed.\n\nSome American media outlets have criticized Latin American media for allegedly featuring a disproportionate number of blond and blue-eyed/green-eyed white actors and actresses in telenovelas, relative to non-whites.\n\n"}
