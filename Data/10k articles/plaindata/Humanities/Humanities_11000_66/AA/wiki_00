It is published by the Department of History at the University of New Brunswick, with articles in either English or French. The name \"Acadiensis\" originated with an earlier periodical with the same name, a general interest quarterly magazine for the Maritime provinces, with an emphasis on local history. It was published in Saint John, New Brunswick by David Russell Jack from 1901 to 1908 but failed due to insufficient financial support.\n\n\"Acadiensis\" was awarded the Clio Prize of the Canadian Historical Association in 1979 for its promotion of regional history. The journal has sponsored the biennial Atlantic Canada Studies Conference since 1974 and awards an annual David Alexander Prize for the best undergraduate essay on Atlantic Canada history. A weekly blog, edited by Corey Slumkoski (Mount Saint Vincent University), publishes current commentaries. A related organization, Acadiensis Press, was established in 1980 to publish books, mainly scholarly editions of documents and thematic collections of essays.\n\nLongterm citation data for \"Acadiensis\" reported by Scopus in 2017 rated the journal in the 68th percentile and ranked it 303 in a list of 983 history journals. \n\nThe journal offers access to its own indexes.

{"id": "1890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1890", "title": "American English", "text": "American English\n\nAmerican English (AmE, AE, AmEng, USEng, en-US), sometimes called United States English or U.S. English, is the set of varieties of the English language native to the United States.\n\nEnglish is the most widely spoken language in the United States and is the common language used by the federal government, to the extent that all laws and compulsory education are practiced in English. Although not an officially established language of the whole country, English is considered the \"de facto\" language and is given official status by 32 of the 50 state governments. As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of Puerto Rico, under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the United States district court for the territory.\n\nThe use of English in the United States is a result of English and British colonization of the Americas. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since then, American English has developed into new dialects, in some cases under the influence of West African and Native American languages, German, Dutch, Irish, Spanish, and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the United States.\n\nAmerican English varieties form a linguistic continuum of dialects more similar to each other than to English dialects of other countries, including some common pronunciations and other features found nationwide. Any North American English accent perceived as free of noticeably local, ethnic, or cultural markers is popularly called \"General\" or \"Standard\" American, a fairly uniform standard of broadcast mass media and the highly educated. Otherwise, according to Labov, with the major exception of Southern American English, regional accents throughout the country are not yielding to this standard, and historical and present linguistic evidence does not support the notion of there being one single \"mainstream\" American accent. On the contrary, the sound of American English continues to evolve, with some local accents disappearing, but several larger regional accents emerging.\n\nWhile written American English is largely standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary. The regional sounds of present-day American English are reportedly engaged in a complex phenomenon of \"both convergence and divergence\": some accents are homogenizing and levelling, while others are diversifying and deviating further away from one another. In 2010, William Labov summarized the current state of regional American accents as follows:\n\nSome regional American English has undergone \"vigorous new sound changes\" since the mid-nineteenth century onwards, spawning relatively recent Mid-Atlantic (centered on Philadelphia and Baltimore), Western Pennsylvania (centered on Pittsburgh), Inland Northern (centered on Chicago, Detroit, and the Great Lakes region), Midland (centered on Indianapolis, Columbus, and Kansas City) and Western regional accents, all of which \"are now more different from each other than they were fifty or a hundred years ago\". Similarly, distinguishing features of the Eastern New England (centered on Boston) and New York City accents appear to be stable. \"On the other hand, dialects of many smaller cities have receded in favor of the new regional patterns\"; for example, the traditional local accents of Charleston and of Cincinnati have given way to the Midland regional accent, and of St. Louis now approaches an Inland Northern or Midland accent. At the same time, the Southern regional accent, despite the huge population it covers, \"is on the whole slowly receding due to cultural stigma: younger speakers everywhere in the South are shifting away from the marked features of Southern speech\". Finally, the extremely local-level \"Hoi Toider\" dialect shows the paradox of receding among younger speakers in the islands of North Carolina's Outer Banks, yet strengthening in the islands of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\nBelow, eleven major American English accents are defined by their particular combinations of certain characteristics:\n\nMarked New England speech is mostly associated with eastern New England, centering on Boston and Providence, and traditionally includes some notable degree of \"r\"-dropping (or non-rhoticity), as well as the back tongue positioning of the vowel (to ) and the vowel (to ). In and north of Boston, the sound is famously centralized or even fronted. Boston shows a cot–caught merger, while Providence keeps the same two vowels sharply distinct.\n\nNew York City English prevails in a relatively small but nationally recognizable dialect region in and around New York City, including Long Island and northeastern New Jersey. The New York accent includes some notable degree of non-rhoticity and a locally unique short-\"a\" vowel pronunciation split. New York City English otherwise broadly follows Northern patterns, except that the vowel is fronted. The cot–caught merger is markedly resisted in the New York metropolitan area, as depicted in popular stereotypes like \"tawwk\" and \"cawwfee\", with this vowel being typically tensed and diphthongal.\n\nMost older Southern speech along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts was non-rhotic, though, today, almost all Southern dialects are rhotic, and even \"hyper-rhotic\", with a very strongly enunciated, \"bunched-tongue\" \"r\" sound. The modern accent is defined most recognizably by the vowel losing its gliding quality to approach , the initiation event for the Southern Vowel Shift. This vowel shift involves the \"Southern drawl\" that makes short front vowels into distinct-sounding gliding vowels. The most advanced sub-varieties exist in the southern Appalachian cities and certain areas of Texas. Non-Southern Americans tend to stereotype Southern accents negatively, associating them with slowness, lack of education, bigotry, and religious or political conservatism, with labels for the accent such as \"hick\" or \"hillbilly\". Meanwhile, Southerners themselves tend to have mixed judgments of their own accents, some negative but some positively associated with a laid-back, plain, or humble attitude.\n\nSince the mid-twentieth century, a distinctive new Northern speech pattern has developed near the Canadian border of the United States, centered on the central and eastern Great Lakes region (but only on the American side). Linguists call this region the \"Inland North\", as defined by its Northern Cities Vowel Shift ( raising, fronting, and other vowel changes), occurring in the same region whose \"standard Midwestern\" speech was the basis for General American in the mid-twentieth century, though prior to the full Northern Cities Vowel Shift. The Inland Northern accent was lampooned on the television show \"Saturday Night Live\"'s \"Bill Swerski's Superfans\" segments, though the accent's shift may be reversing in certain communities. Many people view the \"North Central\" or \"Upper Midwestern\" accent, another Northern accent, from the stereotypical lens of the movie \"Fargo\". The North Central accent is characterized by a more common cot-caught merger and influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region.\n\nBetween the traditional American dialect areas of the \"North\" and \"South\" is what linguists have long called the \"Midland\" encompassing states situated in the lower Midwest, beginning west of the Appalachian Mountains. The vocabulary of its older speakers was divided into two discrete subdivisions, the \"North Midland\" that begins north of the Ohio River valley area, and the \"South Midland\" speech, which to the average American ear has a slight trace of the \"Southern accent\" (especially due to some degree of glide weakening). Modern Midland speech is transitional between a presence and absence of the cot–caught merger. Historically, Pennsylvania was a home of the Midland dialect; however, this state of early English-speaking settlers has now largely split off into new dialect regions, with distinct Philadelphia and Pittsburgh dialects documented since the middle of the twentieth century.\n\nA generalized Midland speech continues westward until becoming a somewhat internally diverse Western American English that unites the entire western half of the country, mostly unified by a firm cot–caught merger and a conservatively backed pronunciation of the long \"oh\" sound in \"goat, toe, show\", etc., but a fronted pronunciation of the long \"oo\" sound in \"goose, lose, tune,\" etc. Western speech itself contains such advanced sub-types as Pacific Northwest English and California English, with the native-speaker English of Mexican Americans also being a sub-type primarily of the Western dialect. The island state of Hawaii, though primarily English-speaking, is also home to a creole language known commonly as Hawaiian Pidgin, and some Hawaii residents speak English with a Pidgin-influenced accent.\n\nAlthough no longer region-specific, African-American Vernacular English, which remains the native variety of most working- and middle-class African Americans, has a close relationship to Southern dialects and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans, including hip hop culture. Hispanic and Latino Americans have also developed native-speaker varieties of English. The best-studied Latino Englishes are Chicano English, spoken in the West and Midwest, and New York Latino English, spoken in the New York metropolitan area. Additionally, ethnic varieties such as Yeshiva English and \"Yinglish\" are spoken by some American Jews, Cajun Vernacular English by some Cajuns in southern Louisiana, Pennsylvania Dutch English by some Pennsylvania Dutch in Pennsylvania and the Midwest, and American Indian Englishes have been documented among diverse Indian tribes.\n\nCompared with English as spoken in England, North American English is more homogeneous, and any North American accent that exhibits a majority of the most common phonological features is known as \"General American\". This section mostly refers to such widespread or mainstream pronunciation features that characterize American English.\n\nStudies on historical usage of English in both the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply deviate away from period British English, but retained certain now-archaic features contemporary British English has since lost. One of these is the rhoticity common in most American accents, because in the 17th century, when English was brought to the Americas, most English in England was also rhotic. The preservation of rhoticity has been further supported by the influences of Hiberno-English, West Country English and Scottish English. In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter is a postalveolar approximant or retroflex approximant rather than a trill or tap (as often heard, for example, in the English accents of Scotland or India). A unique \"bunched tongue\" variant of the approximant \"r\" sound is also associated with the United States, and seems particularly noticeable in the Midwest and South.\n\nTraditionally, the \"East Coast\" comprises three or four major linguistically distinct regions, each of which possesses English varieties both distinct from each other as well as quite internally diverse: New England, the New York metropolitan area, the Mid-Atlantic states (centering on Philadelphia and Baltimore), and the Southern United States. The only traditionally \"r\"-dropping (or non-rhotic) regional accents of American English are all spoken along the Atlantic Coast and parts of the Gulf Coast (particularly still in Louisiana), because these areas were in close historical contact with England and imitated prestigious varieties of \"r\"-dropping London (a feature now widespread throughout most of England) at a time when they were undergoing changes. Today, non-rhoticity is confined in the United States to the accents of eastern New England, New York City, older speakers of the former plantation South, and African-American Vernacular English (though the vowel-consonant cluster found in \"bird\", \"work\", \"hurt\", \"learn\", etc. usually retains its \"r\" pronunciation, even in these non-rhotic accents). Other than these few varieties, American accents are rhotic, pronouncing every instance of the sound.\n\nMany British accents have evolved in other ways compared to which General American English has remained relatively more conservative, for example, regarding the typical southern British features of a trap–bath split, fronting of , and H-dropping, none of which typical American accents show. The innovation of /t/ glottaling, which does occur before a consonant (including a syllabic coronal nasal consonant, like in the words \"button\" or \"satin\") and word-finally in General American, additionally occurs variably between vowels in British English. On the other hand, General American is more innovative than the dialects of England, or English elsewhere in the world, in a number of its own ways:\n\nSome mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:\n\nThe process of coining new lexical items started as soon as English-speaking British-American colonists began borrowing names for unfamiliar flora, fauna, and topography from the Native American languages. Examples of such names are \"opossum, raccoon, squash\", \"moose\" (from Algonquian), \"wigwam\", and \"moccasin\". The languages of the other colonizing nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, \"cookie\", from Dutch; \"kindergarten\" from German, \"levee\" from French; and \"rodeo\" from Spanish. Landscape features are often loanwords from French or Spanish, and the word \"corn\", used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the maize plant, the most important crop in the U.S.\n\nMost Mexican Spanish contributions came after the War of 1812, with the opening of the West, like \"ranch\" (now a common house style). New forms of dwelling created new terms \"(lot, waterfront)\" and types of homes like \"log cabin, adobe\" in the 18th century; \"apartment, \" in the 19th century; \"project, condominium, townhouse, mobile home\" in the 20th century; and parts thereof \"(driveway, breezeway, backyard)\". Industry and material innovations from the 19th century onwards provide distinctive new words, phrases, and idioms through railroading (see further at rail terminology) and transportation terminology, ranging from types of roads (\"dirt roads\", \"freeways\") to infrastructure \"(parking lot, overpass, rest area),\" to automotive terminology often now standard in English internationally. Already existing English words—such as \"store, shop, lumber\"—underwent shifts in meaning; others remained in the U.S. while changing in Britain. From the world of business and finance came new terms (\"merger, downsize, bottom line\"), from sports and gambling terminology came, specific jargon aside, common everyday American idioms, including many idioms related to baseball. The names of some American inventions remained largely confined to North America (\"elevator, gasoline\") as did certain automotive terms (\"truck\", \"trunk\").\n\nNew foreign loanwords came with 19th and early 20th century European immigration to the U.S.; notably, from Yiddish \"(chutzpah, schmooze\") and German (\"hamburger, wiener\"). A large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from \"OK\" and \"cool\" to \"nerd\" and \"24/7),\" while others have not \"(have a nice day, for sure);\" many are now distinctly old-fashioned \"(swell, groovy).\" Some English words now in general use, such as \"hijacking, disc jockey, boost, bulldoze\" and \"jazz,\" originated as American slang.\n\nAmerican English has always shown a marked tendency to use nouns as verbs. Examples of nouns that are now also verbs are \"interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, bad-mouth, vacation, major,\" and many others. Compounds coined in the U.S. are for instance \"foothill, landslide\" (in all senses), \", teenager,\nbrainstorm, , hitchhike, smalltime, and a huge number of others. Some are euphemistic \"(human resources, affirmative action, correctional facility).\" Many compound nouns have the verb-and-preposition combination: \"stopover, lineup, tryout, spin-off, shootout, holdup, hideout, comeback, makeover,\" and many more. Some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin (\"win out, hold up, back up/off/down/out, face up to\" and many others).\n\nNoun endings such as \"-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)\" and \"-cian (beautician)\" are also particularly productive in the U.S. Several verbs ending in \"-ize\" are of U.S. origin; for example, \"fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, weatherize,\" etc; and so are some back-formations \"(locate, fine-tune, curate, donate, emote, upholster\" and \"enthuse).\" Among syntactical constructions that arose are \"outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of,\" etc. Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably \"pesky, phony, rambunctious, buddy, sundae, skeeter, sashay\" and \"kitty-corner.\" Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are, for example, \"lengthy, bossy, cute\" and \"cutesy, punk\" (in all senses), \"sticky\" (of the weather), \"through\" (as in \"finished\"), and many colloquial forms such as \"peppy\" or \"wacky\".\n\nA number of words and meanings that originated in Middle English or Early Modern English and that have been in everyday use in the United States have since disappeared in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in Lowland Scots. Terms such as \"fall\" (\"autumn\"), \"faucet\" (\"tap\"), \"diaper\" (\"nappy\"), \"candy\" (\"sweets\"), \"skillet\", \"eyeglasses\", and \"obligate\" are often regarded as Americanisms. \"Fall\" for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like \"fall of the leaf\" and \"fall of the year\". \"Gotten\" (past participle of \"get\") is often considered to be largely an Americanism. Other words and meanings were brought back to Britain from the U.S., especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include \"hire\" (\"to employ\"), \"I guess\" (famously criticized by H. W. Fowler), \"baggage\", \"hit\" (a place), and the adverbs \"overly\" and \"presently\" (\"currently\"). Some of these, for example, \"monkey wrench\" and \"wastebasket\", originated in 19th century Britain. The adjectives \"mad\" meaning \"angry\", \"smart\" meaning \"intelligent\", and \"sick\" meaning \"ill\" are also more frequent in American (and Irish) English than British English.\n\nLinguist Bert Vaux created a survey, completed in 2003, polling English speakers across the United States about their specific everyday word choices, hoping to identify regionalisms. The study found that most Americans prefer the term \"sub\" for a long sandwich, \"soda\" (but \"pop\" in the Great Lakes region and generic \"coke\" in the South) for a sweet and bubbly soft drink, \"you\" or \"you guys\" for the plural of \"you\" (but \"y'all\" in the South), \"sneakers\" for athletic shoes (but often \"tennis shoes\" outside the Northeast), and \"shopping cart\" for a cart used for carrying supermarket goods.\n\nAmerican English and British English (BrE) often differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.\nThe first large American dictionary, \"An American Dictionary of the English Language\", known as Webster's Dictionary, was written by Noah Webster in 1828, codifying several of these spellings.\n\nDifferences in grammar are relatively minor, and do not normally affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some auxiliary verbs; formal (rather than notional) agreement with collective nouns; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: \"learned\"/\"learnt\", \"burned\"/\"burnt\", \"snuck/sneaked\", \"dove/dived\") although the purportedly \"British\" forms can occasionally be seen in American English writing as well; different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE \"in school,\" BrE \"at school\"); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE \"to the hospital\", BrE \"to hospital\"; contrast, however, AmE \"actress Elizabeth Taylor\", BrE \"the actress Elizabeth Taylor\"). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other, and American English is not a standardized set of dialects.\n\nDifferences in orthography are also minor. The main differences are that American English usually uses spellings such as \"flavor\" for British \"flavour\", \"fiber\" for \"fibre\", \"defense\" for \"defence\", \"analyze\" for \"analyse\", \"license\" for \"licence\", \"catalog\" for \"catalogue\" and \"traveling\" for \"travelling\". Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, \"he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology\". Other differences are due to the francophile tastes of the 19th century Victorian era Britain (for example they preferred \"programme\" for \"program\", \"manoeuvre\" for \"maneuver\", \"cheque\" for \"check\", etc.). AmE almost always uses \"-ize\" in words like \"realize\". BrE prefers \"-ise\", but also uses \"-ize\" on occasion (see Oxford spelling).\n\nThere are a few differences in punctuation rules. British English is more tolerant of run-on sentences, called \"comma splices\" in American English, and American English requires that periods and commas be placed inside closing quotation marks even in cases in which British rules would place them outside. American English also favors the double quotation mark over single.\n\nAmE sometimes favors words that are morphologically more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE \"transportation\" and BrE \"transport\" or where the British form is a back-formation, such as AmE \"burglarize\" and BrE \"burgle\" (from \"burglar\"). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.\n\nBritish English also differs from American English in that \"schedule\" can be pronounced with either [sk] or [ʃ].\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "232026", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=232026", "title": "Chiang Mai", "text": "Chiang Mai\n\nChiang Mai (, from , ) sometimes written as \"Chiengmai\" or \"Chiangmai\", is the largest city in northern Thailand. It is the capital of Chiang Mai Province and was a former capital of the kingdom of Lan Na (1296–1768), which later became the Kingdom of Chiang Mai, a tributary state of Siam from 1774 to 1899, and finally the seat of princely rulers until 1939. It is north of Bangkok near the highest mountains in the country. The city sits astride the Ping River, a major tributary of the Chao Phraya River.\n\nChiang Mai means \"New City\" and was so named because it became the new capital of Lan Na when it was founded in 1296, succeeding Chiang Rai, the former capital founded in 1262.\n\nIn May 2006 Chiang Mai was the site of the Chiang Mai Initiative, concluded between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the \"ASEAN+3\" countries, (China, Japan, and South Korea). Chiang Mai was one of three Thai cities contending for Thailand's bid to host the World Expo 2020. Ayutthaya was ultimately chosen by the Thai Parliament to register for the international competition.\n\nIn early–December 2017, Chiang Mai was awarded the UNESCO title of Creative City. In 2015, Chiang Mai was on the tentative list for UNESCO World Heritage inscription. Chiang Mai was one of two tourist destinations in Thailand on TripAdvisor's 2014 list of \"25 Best Destinations in the World\", where it stands at number 24.\n\nChiang Mai's historic importance is derived from its close proximity to the Ping River and major trading routes.\n\nWhile officially the city (\"thesaban nakhon\", \"city municipality\") of Chiang Mai only covers most parts of the Mueang Chiang Mai District with a population of 160,000, the city's sprawl extends into several neighboring districts. The Chiang Mai metropolitan area has a population of nearly one million people, more than half the total of Chiang Mai Province.\n\nThe city is subdivided into four \"khwaeng\" (electoral wards): Nakhon Ping, Srivijaya, Mengrai, and Kawila. The first three are on the west bank of the Ping River, and Kawila is on the east bank. Nakhon Ping District includes the northern part of the city. Srivijaya, Mengrai, and Kawila consist of the western, southern, and eastern parts, respectively. The city center—within the city walls—is mostly within Srivijaya ward.\n\nThe Ping River, one of the main tributaries of the Chao Phraya River, originates at Doi Thuai, in the mountains of the Daen Lao Range in Chiang Dao District. The river, the largest in the region, runs from north to south, forming a river basin east of Chiang Mai. Mae Ping River also served as the route of trade and communication between Chiang Mai and its controlled states in Lanna, as well as the outside world.\n\nMangrai founded Chiang Mai in 1294 or 1296 on the site of an older city of the Lawa people called Wiang Nopburi. Gordon Young, in his 1962 book \"The Hill tribes of Northern Thailand\", mentions how a Wa chieftain in British Burma told him that the Wa, a people who are closely related to the Lawa, once lived in the Chiang Mai valley in \"sizeable cities\".\n\nChiang Mai succeeded Chiang Rai as the capital of Lan Na. Pha Yu enlarged and fortified the city, and built Wat Phra Singh in honor of his father Kham Fu. The ruler was known as the \"chao\". The city was surrounded by a moat and a defensive wall since nearby Taungoo Dynasty of the Bamar people was a constant threat, as were the armies of the Mongol Empire, which only decades earlier had conquered most of Yunnan, China, and in 1292 overran the bordering Dai kingdom of Chiang Hung.\n\nWith the decline of Lan Na, the city lost importance and was occupied by the Taungoo in 1556. Chiang Mai formally became part of the Thonburi Kingdom in 1775 by an agreement with Chao Kavila, after the Thonburi king Taksin helped drive out the Taungoo Bamar. Because of Taungoo counterattacks, Chiang Mai was abandoned between 1776 and 1791. Lampang then served as the capital of what remained of Lan Na. Chiang Mai then slowly grew in cultural, trading, and economic importance to its current status as the unofficial capital of Northern Thailand, second in importance only to Bangkok.\n\nThe modern municipality dates to a sanitary district (\"sukhaphiban\") that was created in 1915. It was upgraded to a municipality (\"thesaban\") on 29 March 1935, as published in the \"Royal Gazette\", Book No. 52 section 80. First covering just , the city was enlarged to on 5 April 1983.\n\nThe city emblem shows the stupa at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep in its center. Below it are clouds representing the moderate climate in the mountains of northern Thailand. There is a nāga, the mythical snake said to be the source of the Ping River, and rice stalks, which refer to the fertility of the land.\n\nChiang Mai has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen \"Aw\"), tempered by the low latitude and moderate elevation, with warm to hot weather year-round, though nighttime conditions during the dry season can be cool and much lower than daytime highs. The maximum temperature ever recorded was in May 2005. Cold and hot weather effects occur immediately but cold effects last longer than hot effects and contribute to higher cold related motility risk among old people aged more than 85 years.\n\nA continuing environmental issue in Chiang Mai is the incidence of air pollution that primarily occurs every year towards the end of the dry season between February and April. In 1996, speaking at the Fourth International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement conference—held in Chiang Mai that year—the Governor Virachai Naewboonien invited guest speaker Dr. Jakapan Wongburanawatt, Dean of the Social Science Faculty of Chiang Mai University, to discuss air pollution efforts in the region. Dr. Wongburanawatt stated that, in 1994, an increasing number of city residents attended hospitals suffering from respiratory problems associated with the city's air pollution.\n\nDuring the February–March period, air quality in Chiang Mai often remains below recommended standards, with fine-particle dust levels reaching twice the standard limits.\n\nAccording to the \"Bangkok Post\", corporations in the agricultural sector, not farmers, are the biggest contributors to smoke pollution. The main source of the fires is forested area being cleared to make room for new crops. The new crops to be planted after the smoke clears are not rice and vegetables to feed locals. A single crop is responsible: corn. \"The true source of the haze...sits in the boardrooms of corporations eager to expand production and profits. A chart of Thailand's growth in world corn markets can be overlaid on a chart of the number of fires. It is no longer acceptable to scapegoat hill tribes and slash-and-burn agriculture for the severe health and economic damage caused by this annual pollution.\" These data have been ignored by the government. The end is not in sight, as the number of fires has increased every year for a decade, and data shows more pollution in late-February 2016 than in late-February 2015.\n\nThe northern centre of the Meteorological Department has reported that low-pressure areas from China trap forest fire smoke in the mountains along the Thai-Myanmar border. Research conducted between 2005 and 2009 showed that average PM10 rates in Chiang Mai during February and March were considerably above the country's safety level of 120 μg/m, peaking at 383 μg/m on 14 March 2007. PM2.5 rates (fine particles 75% smaller than PM10) reached 183 μg/m in Chiang Mai in 2018. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the acceptable level of PM10 is 50 μg/m and PM2.5 is 25 μg/m.\n\nTo address the increasing amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector in Chiang Mai, the city government has advocated the use of non-motorised transport (NMT). In addition to its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the NMT initiative addresses other issues such as traffic congestion, air quality, income generation for the poor, and the long-term viability of the tourism industry. It has been said that smoke pollution has made March \"the worst month to visit Chiang Mai\".\n\nChiang Mai has over 300 Buddhist temples (\"wat\" in Thai). These include:\n\nThe Administration of Chiang Mai Municipality is responsible for an area that covers approximately 40.216 square kilometers and consists of 4 Municipal Districts, 14 sub-districts, 89 municipal communities, and approximately 70,000 households.\n\nAccording to Municipal Act B.E. 2496 (1953, reviewed in 2003), the duties of the Municipality cover a lot of areas which include clean water supply, waste and sewage disposal, communicable disease control, public training and education, public hospitals and electricity, etc.\n\nThe mayor, or the highest executive, is directly elected by the eligible voters in the municipal area. The mayor serves a four-year term and is assisted by no more than four deputy mayors appointed directly by the mayor. The mayor will thus be permitted to appoint deputies, secretaries and advisors including the mayor himself or herself totally no more than 10. The current Mayor is Tussanai Burabupakorn, as of June 2018.\n\nThe Municipal Council is the legislative body of the municipality. It has the power to issue ordinances by laws that do not contradict with the laws of the country. The municipal council applies to all people living in the municipal area. The Chiang Mai City Municipal Council is composed of 24 elected members from 4 municipal districts who each serves a 4-year term.\n\nChiang Mai hosts many Thai festivals, including:\n\nThe inhabitants speak Northern Thai, also known as \"Lanna\" or \"Kham Mueang\". The script used to write this language, called the Tai Tham alphabet, is studied only by scholars, and the language is commonly written with the standard Thai alphabet. English, Chinese, and Japanese are used in hotels and travel-related businesses.\n\n\nKhan tok is a century-old Lan Na Thai tradition in Chiang Mai. It is an elaborate dinner or lunch offered by a host to guests at various ceremonies or parties, such as weddings, housewarmings, celebrations, novice ordinations, or funerals. It can also be held in connection with celebrations for specific buildings in a Thai temple and during Buddhist festivals such as Khao Pansa, Og Pansa, Loi Krathong, and Thai New Year (Songkran).\n\nChiang Mai has several universities, including Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai Rajabhat University, Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna, Payap University, Far Eastern University, and Maejo University, as well as numerous technical and teacher colleges. Chiang Mai University was the first government university established outside of Bangkok. Payap University was the first private institution in Thailand to be granted university status.\n\nInternational primary and secondary schools for foreign students include:\n\nÉcole française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO), an institute for Asian studies, has a centre in Chiang Mai.\n\n\n\nA number of bus stations link the city to central, southeast, and northern Thailand. The central Chang Puak Terminal (north of Chiang Puak Gate) provides local services within Chiang Mai Province. The Chiang Mai Arcade bus terminal northeast of the city centre (which can be reached with a songthaew or tuk-tuk ride) provides services to over 20 other destinations in Thailand including Bangkok, Pattaya, Hua Hin, and Phuket. There are several services a day from Chiang Mai Arcade terminal to Mo Chit Station in Bangkok (a 10- to 12-hour journey).\n\nThe state railway operates 10 trains a day to Chiang Mai Station from Bangkok. Most journeys run overnight and take approximately 12–15 hours. Most trains offer first-class (private cabins) and second-class (seats fold out to make sleeping berths) service. Chiang Mai is the northern terminus of the Thai railway system.\n\nChiang Mai International Airport receives up to 28 flights a day from Bangkok (flight time about 1 hour 10 minutes) and also serves as a local hub for services to other northern cities such as Chiang Rai, Phrae, and Mae Hong Son. International services also connect Chiang Mai with other regional centers, including cities in other Asian countries.\n\nThe locally preferred form of transport is personal motorbike and, increasingly, private car. Local public transport is via tuk-tuk, songthaew, bus, or rickshaw. New electric tuks-tuks were introduced into the city in June 2017.\n\nAs population density continues to grow, greater pressure is placed upon the city's transportation system. During peak hours, the road traffic is often badly congested. The city officials as well as researchers and experts have been trying to find feasible solutions to tackle the city's traffic problems. Most of them agree that factors such as lack of public transport, increasing number of motor vehicles, inefficient land use plan and urban sprawl, have led to these problems.\n\nThe latest development is that Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) has approved a draft decree on the light railway transit system project in Chiang Mai. If the draft is approved by the Thai cabinet, the construction could begin in 2020 and be completed by 2023. It is believed that such a system would mitigate Chiang Mai's traffic problems to a large degree.\n\nIn February 2017, the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (DEPA) (under Thailand's Digital Economy and Society Ministry) announced that 36.5 million baht would be invested into developing Chiang Mai into an innovation-driven \"smart city\". Chiang Mai was the second city in Thailand, after Phuket and along with Khon Kaen, to be developed using the \"smart city\" model. The model aims to capture and populate multiple levels of information (including building, social, environmental, governmental, and economic data) from sources like sensors, real-time traffic information, and social forums for access by managers, governments, and citizens using mobile apps, tablets, and dashboards. The \"Smart City\" outlook (integrating Information and Communications Technology (ICT) with the Internet of Things (IOT)), is viewed to be critical both for secondary cities with burgeoning urban population like Chiang Mai, as well as part of Thailand's move to be digital hub of ASEAN.\n\nThe role of private sector investment, together with public sector partnership, is key to promote digital entrepreneurship. Prosoft Comtech, a Thai software company, has spent 300 million baht to build its own \"Oon IT Valley\" on a 90 rai plot of land as a community for tech start-ups, Internet of Things technology, software programmers and business process outsourcing services. It is aimed to both increase the size of Chiang Mai's digital workforce, as well as attract foreign digital talent to Chiang Mai.\n\nIn January 2018, it was announced that Chiang Mai would be launching \"Mobike In\", a bike-sharing app that would see the introduction of some 500 smart bikes on the streets. The smart bikes would be available for use for both locals and tourists. It is reported that as a start, the bikes would be placed at convenient locations including the Three Kings monument, Tha Pae Gate and Suan Buak Haad Park, as well as in the old town. The \"Mobike In\" project is sponsored by Advanced Info Service (Thailand's largest mobile phone operator), in collaboration with the Tourism Authority of Thailand (Chiang Mai Office), together with local universities, public and private sectors. The project aims to promote non-motorised transportation and support eco-tourism. Speaking at the launch at the Lanna Folklife Museum, Deputy Governor Puttipong Sirimart stated that the introduction of such \"smart transportation\" was a positive move in Chiang Mai's transformation into a \"Smart City\" (part of the \"Thailand 4.0\" vision).\n\nPhongsak Ariyajitphaisal, DEPA's Chiang Mai branch manager, stated that one of the areas its smart city initiative would be promoting was \"smart agriculture\". Eighty percent of Chiang Mai Province's population are farmers, mostly small-scale, and increasing productivity through use of ICT has the potential to improve the local economy and living standards. DEPA has also provided funding to Chiang Mai's Maejo University, to develop wireless sensor systems for better farmland irrigation techniques, to reduce use of water sprinklers and increase productivity. The university is also developing agricultural drones that can spray fertilizers and pesticides on crops which, if successful, will result in lower costs. The drones may also detect and monitor fires and smoke pollution.\n\nUnder the 2011 IBM \"Smarter Cities Challenge\", IBM experts recommended smarter food initiatives focused on creating agricultural data for farmers, including price modelling, farmer-focused weather forecasting tools, an e-portal to help farmers align crop production with demand, as well as branding of Chiang Mai produce. Longer-term recommendations included implementing traceability, enabling the tracking of produce from farm to consumer, smarter irrigation as well as flood control and early warning systems.\n\nAs part of the smart city project supported by IBM, Chiang Mai is also looking to use technology to boost its presence as a medical tourism hub. In 2011, IBM launched its Smarter Cities Challenge, a three-year, 100 city, 1.6 billion baht (US$50 million) program where teams of experts study and make detailed recommendations to address local important urban issues. Chiang Mai won a grant of about US$400,000 in 2011. The IBM team focused on smarter healthcare initiatives, aimed at making Chiang Mai and the University Medical Clinic a medical hub, as well as improving efficiency of hospitals for improved service delivery. For example, healthcare providers could use real-time location tracking of patients and hospital assets to increase efficiency and build an internationally recognised service identity. Electronic medical record technology can also be adopted to standardise information exchanges to link all medical service providers, even including traditional medicine and spas. Similar ideas include linking patient databases and healthcare asset information. In partnership with the Faculty of Medicine at Chiang Mai University, the team of experts aim to enhance the quality of medical care available to the community, both urban and rural, as well as develop Chiang Mai into a centre for medical tourism with the infrastructure for supporting international visitors seeking long-term medical care.\n\nAs the largest city in northern Thailand, Chiang Mai already receives some long stay healthcare visitors, largely Japanese. Its main advantage over Bangkok is lower costs of living. Quality services at low prices are a major selling point in mainstream healthcare, dental and ophthalmologic care as well as Thai traditional medicine. Its local university is also developing specializations in robotic surgery and geriatric medicine to accommodate a future aging population.\n\nDEPA also reported that it has developed a mobile app that uses augmented reality technology to showcase various historical attractions in Chiang Mai, in line with the government's policy to promote Chiang Mai as a world heritage city.\n\nAccording to Thailand's Tourist Authority, in 2013 Chiang Mai had 14.1 million visitors: 4.6 million foreigners and 9.5 million Thais. In 2016, tourist arrivals were expected to grow by approximately 10 percent to 9.1 million, with Chinese tourists increasing by seven percent to 750,000 and international arrivals by 10 percent to 2.6 million. Tourism in Chiang Mai has been growing annually by 15 percent per year since 2011, mostly due to Chinese tourists who account for 30 percent of international arrivals. In 2015, 7.4 million tourists visited Chiang Mai. Out of these, 35 percent were foreign tourists. The number of tourists has increased with an average rate of 13.6 percent annually between 2009 and 2015. The major reasons that have made Chiang Mai a tourist attraction are its topography, climate, and cultural history.\n\nChiang Mai is estimated to have 32,000–40,000 hotel rooms and Chiang Mai International Airport (CNX) is Thailand's fourth largest airport, after Suvarnabhumi (BKK), Don Mueang (DMK), and Phuket (HKT).\n\nThe Thailand Convention and Exhibition Bureau (TCEB) aims to market Chiang Mai as a global MICE city as part of a five-year plan. The TCEB forecasts revenue from MICE to rise by 10 percent to 4.24 billion baht in 2013 and the number of MICE travellers to rise by five percent to 72,424.\n\nThe influx of tourists has put a strain on the city's natural resources. Faced with rampant unplanned development, air and water pollution, waste management problems, and traffic congestion, the city has launched a non-motorised transport (NMT) system. The initiative, developed by a partnership of experts and with support from the Climate & Development Knowledge Network, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create employment opportunities for the urban poor. The climate compatible development strategy has gained support from policy-makers and citizens alike as a result of its many benefits.\n\nTourism has also brought benefits for local community of Chiang Mai. For example, tourism has played a tremendous role in promoting arts and crafts market in Chiang Mai. Tourists have increased demand for traditional crafts and art forms that has resulted in the incentives for the local artists to enhance their work thus adding to the prosperity of the sector.\nMoreover, there are great opportunities for agritourism in Chiang Mai.The factor analysis illustrates three types of agri needs, activities and shopping, facilities, services and location and the last one attractions and environment. Agritoursim is a type of business that a farmer conducts for additional farm income. Farmers, through the promotions of agricultural products, provide enjoyment and educate public about farming and agriculture.\n\n\nChiang Mai has agreements with the following sister cities:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "190348", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190348", "title": "Christian Identity", "text": "Christian Identity\n\nChristian Identity (also known as Identity Christianity) is a racist, anti-Semitic, and white supremacist interpretation of Christianity which holds that only Germanic, Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Nordic, Aryan people and those of kindred blood are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and hence the descendants of the ancient Israelites (primarily as a result of the Assyrian captivity).\n\nChristian Identity is not an organized religion, and is not connected with specific Christian denominations; instead, it is independently practiced by individuals, independent congregations and some prison gangs. Its theology promotes a racial interpretation of Christianity. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who regarded Europeans as the \"chosen people\" and Jews as the cursed offspring of Cain, the \"serpent hybrid\" or serpent seed (a belief known as the two-seedline doctrine). White supremacist sects and gangs later adopted many of these teachings.\n\nChristian Identity holds that all non-whites (people not of wholly European descent) on the planet will either be exterminated or enslaved in order to serve the white race in the new Heavenly Kingdom on Earth under the reign of Jesus Christ. Its doctrine states that only \"Adamic\" (white people) can achieve salvation and paradise. Many adherents are Millennialist.\n\nThe Christian Identity movement emerged in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s as an offshoot sect of British Israelism. The idea that \"lower races\" are mentioned in the Bible (in contrast to Aryans) was posited in the 1905 book \"Theozoology; or The Science of the Sodomite Apelings and the Divine Electron\" by Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels, a volkisch writer seen by many historians as a major influence on Nazism. Adolf Hitler, however, did not subscribe to the belief that the Israelites of the Bible were Aryans; in a speech he gave in Munich in 1920 titled \"Why We Are Anti-Semites\", he referred to and disparaged Abraham as racially Jewish.\n\nWhile early British Israelites such as Edward Hine and John Wilson were philo-semites, Christian Identity emerged in sharp contrast as a strongly antisemitic theology. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describes the emergence of Christian Identity from British Israelism as an 'ugly turn':\nAnother source describes the emergence of Christian Identity from British Israelism as a \"remarkable transition\", also noting that traditional British Israelites were advocates of philosemitism which paradoxically changed to antisemitism and racism under Christian Identity. In fact, British Israelism itself had several Jewish members, and it received support from rabbis throughout the 19th century; within British politics it supported Benjamin Disraeli, who was descended from Sephardi Jews. However, Christian Identity, which emerged in the 1920s, began to turn antisemitic by teaching the belief that the Jews are not descended from the tribe of Judah (as British Israelites maintain), but are instead descended from Satan or Edomite-Khazars. The British Israel form of the belief held no antisemitic views; its followers instead held the view that Jews made up a minority of the tribes of Israel (Judah and Benjamin), with the British and other related Northern European peoples making up the remainder.\n\nChristian Identity can be traced back to 1886 with the publication of the book, \"Lost Israel Found in the Anglo-Saxon Race\", by E.P. Ingersoll. This was followed in the 1920s by the writings of Howard Rand (1889–1991).\n\nRand was a Massachusetts lawyer who obtained a law degree at the University of Maine. He was raised as a British Israelite, and his father introduced him to J. H. Allen's work \"Judah's Sceptre and Joseph's Birthright\" (1902) at an early age. While Rand's father was not an antisemite, nor was Rand in his early British Israelite years, Rand first added an antisemitic element to British Israelism in the 1920s. He claimed as early as 1924 that the Jews were not really descended from the tribe of Judah, but were instead the descendants of Esau or Canaanites. However, Rand never claimed that modern Jews were descendants of Satan, or that they were in any way inferior; he just claimed that they were not the true lineal descendants of Judah. For this reason Rand is considered a 'transitional' figure from British Israelism to Christian Identity, but not its actual founder.\n\nRand is known as the first person to coin the term 'Christian Identity'. Rand had set up the Anglo-Saxon Federation of America in 1933 which promoted his view that Jews were not descended from Judah; this marked the first key transition from British Israelism to Christian Identity. Beginning in May 1937, there were key meetings of British Israelites in the United States who were attracted to Rand's theory that the Jews were not descended from Judah. This provided the catalyst for the eventual emergence of Christian Identity. By the late 1930s the group considered Jews to be the offspring of Satan and demonised them, as they did non-Caucasian races. William Dudley Pelley, founder of the clerical fascist Silver Shirts movement, also promoted an anti-semitic form of British Israelism in the early 1930s. Links between Christian Identity and the Ku Klux Klan also emerged in the late 1930s, although the KKK was past the peak of its early 20th century revival.\n\nWesley Swift (1913–1970) is considered by the FBI to have been the most significant figure in the early years of the Christian Identity movement. Swift was born in New Jersey, and eventually moved to Los Angeles in order to attend Bible college. It is claimed that he may have been a \"Ku Klux Klan organizer and a Klan rifle-team instructor.\" In 1946, he founded his own church in Lancaster, California. In the 1950s, he was Gerald L. K. Smith's West Coast representative of the Christian Nationalist Crusade. In addition, he hosted a daily radio broadcast in California during the 1950s and 1960s, through which he was able to proclaim his ideology to a large audience. Due to Swift's efforts, the message of his church spread, leading to the creation of similar churches throughout the country.\n\nIn 1957, the name of his church was changed to The Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which is used today by Aryan Nations (AN) churches. One of Swift's associates was retired Col. William Potter Gale (1917–1988). According to claims of unknown reliability, Gale had previously been an aide to General Douglas MacArthur, and had coordinated guerrilla resistance in the Philippines during World War II. Gale became a leading figure in the anti-tax and paramilitary movements of the 1970s and 1980s, beginning with the California Rangers and the Posse Comitatus, and helping to found the militia movement.\n\nNumerous Christian Identity churches preach similar messages. Some espouse more violent rhetoric than others, but all believe Aryans to be God's chosen race. Gale introduced future Aryan Nations founder Richard Girnt Butler to Swift. Until then, Butler had admired George Lincoln Rockwell and Senator Joseph McCarthy, and had been relatively secular. Swift quickly converted him to Christian Identity. When Swift died, Butler took over the Church, to the apparent dismay of both Gale and Swift's family. Neither Butler nor Gale rivaled Swift as a dynamic orator, and attendance dwindled under the new pastor. Butler eventually renamed the organisation \"The Church of Jesus Christ Christian/Aryan Nations\" and moved it to Hayden Lake, Idaho.\n\nLesser figures participated as Christian Identity theology took shape in the 1940s and 1950s, such as San Jacinto Capt, a Baptist minister and California Klansman (who claimed that he had introduced Wesley Swift to Christian Identity); and Bertrand Comparet (1901–1983), one-time San Diego Deputy City Attorney (and lawyer for Gerald L. K. Smith). But for the most part, today's Christian Identity groups seem to have been generated by Wesley Swift, through his lieutenants William Potter Gale and Richard Butler.\n\nRather than being an organized religion, Christian Identity (\"CI\") is adhered to by individuals, independent congregations and some prison gangs with a white supremacist theology that promotes a racial interpretation of Christianity. Christian Identity beliefs were primarily developed and promoted by two authors who considered Europeans to be the chosen people and Jews to be the cursed offspring of Cain, the \"serpent hybrid\" (or Serpent seed) (a belief known as the two-seedline doctrine). An early Christian Identity teacher, Wesley A. Swift (1913–1970), formulated the doctrine that non-Caucasian peoples have no souls and therefore can never earn God's favor or be saved. The theology was promoted by George Lincoln Rockwell (1918 – 1967), the founder of the American Nazi Party.\n\nNo single document expresses the Christian Identity belief system; there is much disagreement over the doctrines being taught by those ascribing to CI beliefs, since there is no central organization or headquarters for the CI sect. However, all CI adherents believe that Adam and his offspring were exclusively White and that the other pre-Adamite races are separate species, which cannot be either equated with or derived from the Adamites. CI adherents cite passages from the Old Testament, including Ezra 9:2, 12 and Nehemiah 13:27, which they claim contain injunctions by Yahweh against interracial marriages. Christian Identity believers reject the doctrines of most contemporary Christian denominations and they believe that the doctrine which advocates the view that God's promises to Israel (through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob) have been expanded to create a spiritual people of \"Israel\", i.e., the Christian Church, is heresy.\n\nThe Christian Identity movement first received widespread attention from the mainstream media in 1984, when the white nationalist organization known as The Order embarked on a murderous crime spree before it was suppressed by the FBI. Tax resister and militia movement organizer Gordon Kahl, whose death in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities helped inspire The Order, also had connections to the Christian Identity movement. The movement returned to public attention in 1992 and 1993, in the wake of the deadly Ruby Ridge confrontation, when newspapers discovered that former Green Beret and right-wing separatist Randy Weaver had at least a loose association with Christian Identity believers.\n\nThese groups are estimated to have two thousand members in the United States and an unknown number in Canada and the rest of the British Commonwealth. Due to the promotion of Christian Identity doctrines through radio and later through the Internet, an additional fifty thousand unaffiliated individuals are thought to hold Christian Identity beliefs. The primary spread of Christian Identity teachings is believed to be through white supremacist prison gangs.\n\nChristian Identity asserts that the white people of Europe or Caucasians in general are God's servant people, according to the promises that were given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It further asserts that the early European tribes were really the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel and therefore the rightful heirs to God's promises, and God's chosen people. Colin Kidd wrote that in America, Christian Identity exploited \"the puzzle of the Ten Lost Tribes to justify an openly anti-Semitic and virulently racist agenda.\"\n\nLike British Israelites, Christian Identity (CI) adherents believe in Two House Theology, which makes a distinction between the Tribe of Judah and the Ten Lost Tribes. However the major difference between British Israelism and CI is that British Israelites have always maintained that Jews are descended from the tribe of Judah. In contrast, while also maintaining a Two House distinction, Christian Identity proponents believe that the true lineal descendants of Judah are \"not\" contemporary Jews, but are instead White Europeans whose ancestors settled mainly in Scotland, Germany, and other European nations, alongside the House of Israel. In short, Christian Identity adherents believe that instead of modern-day Jews, the true descendents of the Houses of Israel and Judah are the modern-day Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Germanic, Nordic, and kindred peoples. Some CI scholars teach the belief that many contemporary Jews are the descendants of Cain, citing Genesis 3:15, John 8:44 and 1 John 3:12 in support of their position; they also teach that Cain was the spawn of Satan.\n\nIdentity teaches that \"Israel\" was the name given to Jacob after he wrestled with the angel at Peniel as described in Genesis 32:26–32. \"Israel\" then had twelve sons, which began the Twelve Tribes of Israel. In 975 BC the ten northern tribes revolted, seceded from the south, and became the Kingdom of Israel. After they were subsequently conquered by Assyria at approximately 721 BC, the ten tribes disappeared from the Biblical record and became known as the Lost Tribes of Israel.\n\nAccording to Identity doctrine, 2 Esdras 13:39–46 then records the history of the nation of Israel journeying over the Caucasus mountains, along the Black Sea, to the Ar Sereth tributary of the Danube in Romania (\"But they formed this plan for themselves, that they would leave the multitude of the nations and go to a more distant region, where no human beings had ever lived. … Through that region there was a long way to go, a journey of a year and a half; and that country is called Arzareth\"). The tribes prospered, and eventually colonised other European countries. Israel's leading tribe, the Tribe of Dan, is attributed with settling and naming many areas which are today distinguished by place names derived from its name – written ancient Hebrew contains no vowels, and hence \"Dan\" would be written as DN, but would be pronounced with an intermediate vowel dependent on the local dialect, meaning that \"Dan\", \"Den\", \"Din\", \"Don\", and \"Dun\" all have the same meaning. Various modern place names are said to derive from the name of this tribe:\n\nSome followers claim that the Identity genealogy of the Davidic line can be traced to the royal rulers of Britain and Queen Elizabeth II herself. Thus Anglo-Saxons are the true Israelites, God's chosen people who were given the divine right to rule the world until the Second Coming of Christ.\n\nA major tenet of Christian Identity is the pre-Adamite hypothesis. Christian Identity followers believe that Adam and Eve are only the ancestors of white people, and that Adam and Eve were preceded by lesser, non-Caucasian races which are often (although not always) identified as \"beasts of the field\"; for example, the \"beasts\" which wore sackcloth and cried unto God () are identified as black races by Christian Identity adherents. To support their theory on the racial identity of Adam, Christian Identity proponents point out that the Hebrew etymology of the word 'Adam' translates as 'be ruddy, red, to show blood (in the face)' often quoting from James Strong's \"Hebrew Dictionary\" and from this they conclude that only Caucasians or people with light white skin can blush or turn rosy in the face (because hemoglobin is only visible under pale skin). Proponents of Christian Identity believe that Adam was only created six thousand years ago, while the other, non-Caucasian races were created during far older epochs that occurred on the other continents.\n\nDual Seedline Christian Identity proponents— those who believe that Eve bore children with Satan as well as with Adam —believe that Eve was seduced by the Serpent (Satan), shared her fallen state with Adam by lying down with him, and gave birth to twins with different fathers: Satan's son Cain and Adam's son Abel. This belief is referred to as the serpent seed doctrine. According to the \"dual seedline\" form of Christian Identity, Cain then became the progenitor of the Jews in his subsequent matings with members of the non-Adamic races.\n\nThe serpent seed idea, which ascribes the ancestry of legendary monsters such as Grendel to Cain, was somewhat widespread in the Middle Ages. It also appears in early Gnostic Christian texts as well as in some Jewish texts, for example a 9th-century book titled \"Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer\". In his book \"Cain: Son of the Serpent\", David Max Eichhorn, traces the idea back to early Jewish Midrashic texts and he identifies many rabbis who taught the belief that Cain was the son of a union between the Serpent and Eve.\n\nSome Kabbalist rabbis also believe that Cain and Abel were of a different genetic background than Seth. This teaching is based on the theory that God created two \"Adams\" (\"adam\" means \"man\" in Hebrew). To one he gave a soul and to the other he did not give a soul. The one without a soul is the creature known in Christianity as the Serpent. The Kabbalists call the serpent the \"Nahash\" (which means the \"serpent\" in Hebrew).\n\nThis is recorded in the Zohar:\n\nA seminal influence on the Christian Identity movement's views on pre-Adamism was a book published in 1900 by Charles Carroll titled \"The Negro a Beast or In the Image of God?\". In the book Carroll concluded that Adam only gave birth to the White race and the White race was made in the image and likeness of God, while Negroes are pre-Adamite beasts who could not possibly have been made in God's image and likeness because they are beast-like, immoral and ugly. Carroll claimed that the pre-Adamite races such as blacks did not have souls. Carroll believed that race mixing was an insult to God because it spoiled His racial plan of creation. According to Carroll, the mixing of races had also led to the errors of Atheism and evolutionism.\n\nChristian Identity proponents believe that both the universe and Earth are billions of years old and that non-Caucasian races were created hundreds of thousands or even millions of years ago. However, they believe that Adam (who was the father of the white race or Caucasians) was only created around 6,000 years ago.\n\nWesley Swift strongly criticised Young Earth Creationism and the traditional Judeo-Christian view that Noah's flood was global. He instead believed that the flood was only local and that the Earth was billions of years old. Christian Identity adherents claim that the flood in Genesis only rose high enough to drown the region of the Tarim Basin below sea level (Gen. 7:20) and that therefore the Hebrew word \"eretz\" which appears in those verses should be rendered \"the land\" (as in a specific place) rather than \"the earth.\"\n\nRacialism, or race-based philosophy, is the core tenet of Christian Identity, and most CI adherents are white nationalists who support racial segregation. Some CI adherents believe that Jews are genetically compelled by their Satanic or Edomite ancestry to carry on a conspiracy against the Adamic seedline and that Jews have today achieved almost complete control of the Earth through their claim to the white race's status as God's chosen people. As a general rule, Christian Identity followers adhere to the traditional Christian views on the role of women (See Biblical patriarchy), abortion, and homosexuality, and they believe that racial miscegenation is a sin and a violation of God's law in Genesis 1:24–25 which commands that all creatures should produce \"kind after kind.\"\n\nIn addition to their strict fundamentalist racial views Christian Identity adherents distinguish themselves from mainstream Protestant Fundamentalism in various areas of theology. Some Christian Identity adherents follow the Mosaic law of the Old Testament (e.g., dietary restrictions, the seventh-day Sabbath and certain annual festivals such as Passover). It is also commonplace for some Christian Identity adherents to follow the Sacred Name Movement and they insist on using the original Hebrew names when referring to God (Yahweh) and Jesus Christ (Yahshua). Some Christian Identity writers criticize modern Bible editions as well as the Jews for their removal of the original Hebrew name of God from the Bible. Although their adherence to Old Testament Mosaic law may make them appear \"Jewish\"; they claim that the Jewish interpretation of the law has been corrupted through the Jews' Talmud. Unlike many Protestant Fundamentalists, Christian Identity adherents reject the notion of a Rapture, believing it to be a Judaized doctrine which the Bible does not teach.\n\nChristian Identity politics was first reviewed by Howard Rand and William J. Cameron after the Great Depression. In 1943, Rand published the article \"Digest of the Divine Law\" which discussed the political and economic challenges at that time. An excerpt from the article states: \"We shall not be able to continue in accord with the old order. Certain groups are already planning an economy of regimentation for our nation; but it will only intensify the suffering and want of the past and bring to our peoples all the evils that will result from such planning by a group of men who are failing to take into consideration the fundamental principles underlying the law of the Lord.\"\n\nWhile Rand never formally admitted to what groups he was specifically referring, his hatred for Jews, racial integration, and the country's economic state at the time made the direction of his comments obvious. Identifying specific economic problems was not the only goal which Rand had in mind. He began to analyze how to make these changes happen through legal changes; thus creating strategic plans to integrate the Bible into American law and economics. The first goal was to denounce all man-made laws and to replace them with laws from the Bible. The second goal was to create an economic state that would reflect teachings from the bible. Both Howard Rand and William Cameron believed in these principles and this was because according to Christian Identity's teachings, they possessed access to knowledge about God's law that no one else does. Since they had access to more information, they were responsible for influencing current civil law in order to maintain God's standards.\n\nWhile William Cameron agreed with Rand's initial argument, he focused his writings more specifically on changing American economics. One of Cameron's articles \"The Economic Law of God\" spoke of the Bible supporting individualism and social justice in regards to economics. He also believed that the government had no right to tax land, or other forms of property. In accordance with this doctrine, tax refunds should be applied to family vacation trips or be applied to national festivals for Christian Identity movements. Also for the betterment of the United States' economic future, no interest should be applied to accounts paid with credit, and no taxes should be imputed during the traveling time of goods from a manufacturer to the consumer.\n\nThe mutual point which both Rand and Cameron shared, was that while they may have disagreed with how the government was operating, neither men resisted the current tax policies. Gordon Kahl was the first CI believer who took the founding principles from Rand and Cameron, and applied them in order to take action against the government. Kahl believed that the men were on the right track in regards to what needed to be accomplished in order to change public policies, however he felt that without taking action against violators, no real changes would be made. In 1967 he stopped paying taxes because he felt he was paying \"tithes to the Synagogue of Satan.\" Years later, Gordon Kahl, the CI farmer from North Dakota, took it upon himself to kill two federal marshals in 1983. Before he was caught for the murders, Kahl wrote a note in which he said \"our nation has fallen into the hands of alien people. … These enemies of Christ have taken their Jewish Communist Manifesto and incorporated it into the Statutory Laws of our country and thrown our Constitution and our Christian Common Law into the garbage can.\"\n\nChristian Identity supporters believe in the Second Coming and Armageddon. Predictions vary, including a race war or a Jewish-backed United Nations takeover of the US, and they endorse physical struggle against what they see as the forces of evil.\n\nIdentity asserts that disease, addiction, cancer, and sexually transmitted infections (herpes and HIV/AIDS) are spread by human \"rodents\" via contact with \"unclean\" persons, such as \"race-mixers\". The apocrypha, the first book of Enoch, is used to justify these social theories; the fallen angels of Heaven sexually desired Earth maidens and took them as wives, resulting in the birth of abominations, which God ordered Michael the Archangel to destroy, thus beginning a cosmic war between Light and Darkness. The mixing of separate things (e.g., people of different races) is seen as defiling both, and it is also considered a violation of God's law.\n\nIdentity preachers proclaim that, according to the Bible, \"the penalties for race-mixing, homo-sexuality, and usury are death.\" The justification for killing homosexuals is provided in Leviticus 20:13 \"If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.\" Exodus 22:25, Leviticus 25:35–37 and Deuteronomy explicitly condemn usury. Ezekiel 18:13 states \"He who hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? He shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him\" and is quoted as justification for killing Jews.\n\nIdentity followers reject the label \"antisemitic\", stating that they cannot be antisemitic, since the true Semites \"today are the great White Christian nations of the western world\", with modern Jews in fact being descendants of the Canaanites.\n\nIdentity doctrine asserts that the \"root of all evil\" is paper money (in particular Federal Reserve Notes), and that usury and banking systems are controlled by Jews. The creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 shifted control of money from Congress to private institutions and violated the Constitution. The money system encourages the Federal Reserve to take out loans, creating trillions of dollars of government debt and allowing international bankers to control America. Credit/debit cards and computerised bills are seen as the fulfillment of the Biblical scripture warning against \"the beast\" (i.e., banking) as quoted in Revelation 13:15–18. Identity preacher Sheldon Emry claims \"Most of the owners of the largest banks in America are of Eastern European (Jewish) ancestry and connected with the (Jewish) Rothschild European banks\", thus, in Identity doctrine, the global banking conspiracy is led and controlled by Jewish interests.\n\nChristian Identity is a major unifying theology for a number of diverse groups of white nationalist Christians. It is a belief system that provides its members with a religious basis for racial separatism. Herbert W. Armstrong is inaccurately described by some of his critics, as well as by supporters of Christian Identity, as having supported Christian Identity, due to his belief in a modified form of British Israelism, and the fact that during his lifetime, he propounded observances favoured by many Christian Identity groups, such as seventh-day Sabbatarianism and biblical festivals. The Worldwide Church of God which Armstrong founded did not subscribe to the anti-Semitism commonly espoused by the Christian or Israel Identity groups but instead adhered to the traditional beliefs of British Israelism; i.e., the belief that modern day Jews are descendants of the Tribe of Judah whereas the Anglo-Saxons, Celts, Danes, etc. are descendants of the remaining Ten Tribes of Israel formerly known as the Northern Kingdom.\n\nChristian Identity groups include \"The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord\", the Phineas Priesthood, the Oklahoma Constitutional Militia, also known as The Universal Church of God. Christian Identity is also adhered to by other groups such as Aryan Nations, the Aryan Republican Army (ARA) and the Patriots Council, Church of Jesus Christ Christian, Thomas Robb, LaPorte Church of Christ, Mission To Israel, Folk And Faith, Jubilee, Traditionalist Youth Network, Yahweh's Truth (James Wickstrom), Church of Israel The Shepherd's Chapel and Kingdom Identity Ministries.\n\nSouth African branches of Christian Identity have been accused of involvement in terrorist activities, including the 2002 Soweto bombings.\n\nOther Christian Identity groups include the Heritage Christian Church and the Legion for the Survival of Freedom.\n\nPeople\n\nLists\n\nOther related topics\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Illustrations on the front blade of the fans are varied in subject matter; from illustrations of Jesus Christ, to notable people within the respective churches community.\n\nWith the spread of modern air-conditioning units within church buildings, church fans have become less popular.

{"id": "57158394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57158394", "title": "Conservation of South Asian household shrines", "text": "Conservation of South Asian household shrines\n\nThe Conservation of South Asian household shrines is an activity dedicated to the preservation of household shrines from South Asia. When applied to cultural heritage, held by either museums or private collectors, this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer. South Asian shrines held in museum collections around the world are principally shrines relate to Hindu, Jain, or Buddhist households. Due to their original use and sacred nature, these shrines present unique conservation and restoration challenges for those tasked with their care.\n\nIn all three of these religions, daily ritual devotion is a central aspect. Shrines facilitate this practice by offering a sacred space within the home, serving as a focal point for meditation and offerings to the gods and enlightened ones. Daily rituals at household shrines can take many forms, but often feature some of the following practices: meditation and/or prayer, ritual bathing of sculptures in water, anointing with oils, lighting of candles or burning of incense, and offering of flowers and/or food. Devotional practices vary not only from religion to religion, but also from person to person. The above list contains common actions, but the form of daily ritual is set by the individual. \nShrines for household use vary in size, from simple tabletop setups with room for a sculpture and a few offerings to full shrines taking up entire walls. Devotional items and smaller shrines are typically purchased ready-made, though wealthier households often commissioned elaborate custom shrines. Though primarily made of wood and paint, household shrines sometimes feature extra adornment such as gold leaf or leather fittings. In far Eastern countries, like China and Japan, such shrines are often lacquered.\n\nHousehold shrines can suffer damage from two overall sources: the materials used are at risk of deterioration particular to their nature, and the ways the shrines are used can cause specific types of wear and tear.\n\nAs discussed, the majority of household shrines are made of painted wood, and both wood and paint are susceptible to the effects of humidity. Changes in the relative humidity of the wood’s environment can cause it to swell (in increased humidity) or shrink (in decreased humidity). Extreme or prolonged swelling can result in warping, while excess shrinkage can lead to cracks, particularly around nail or screw holes. In addition to damaging the wood, fluctuations in humidity can also deteriorate paint and other surface decoration: changes in humidity can result in loosening, flaking, and cracking paint. Gold leaf can dissolve in water, especially if applied with a water-soluble adhesive. Lacquer, a layer of shellac creating a clear, hardened surface, can delaminate from the underlying paint and wood layers if changes in humidity cause the wood to flex too much.\n\nPests can be attracted to the wood itself, or, in the case of shrines, to the offerings that are left on it. Insects feed on wood or burrow into it to build nests, weakening the structure and causing unsightly holes. The types of insects vary by region, but can include species of ants, bees, or termites. Fungi also feed on wood, albeit on a smaller scale, and depending on the type can cause everything from discoloration to disintegration.\n\nA family shrine is in less danger of rats than the presence of food would lead one to believe, as the offerings are replaced on a daily basis. However, rats are attracted to food, and will gnaw through wood to get it, leaving holes.\n\nDirect sunlight or artificial light, both present in a home environment, can bleach wood and paint colors and, over a long period of time, weaken or deteriorate the wood’s cellular structure.\n\nHumans are, unfortunately, a source of pollutants that can damage a family shrine. Touching the surface can leave behind oils, salts, and acids present in skin, which over time can build up on the shrine and cause staining and surface erosion. Dirt and dust, if not frequently removed, can scratch and erode the wood. Ancient shrines have been found buried and accumulated significant damage from being encased in the soil. The most common pollutant for home shrines, particular in Buddhist households, is smoke: burning incense or candles is a standard component of daily prayer, and the smoke blackens the shrine over time. Superficial burns to the wood, though unlikely, are also possible.\n\nProtecting household shrines from further deterioration requires considering each of the agents of decay in terms of the activities of storage, handling, and display.\n\nThe ideal relative humidity for wooden objects is 50%; museums aim to keep the environment’s relative humidity within a few percentage points of this target; typically with no more than 10% fluctuation within a 24 hour period. A stable temperature is also considered preferable, as any fluctuations directly affects relative humidity. Conservators use an Integrated Pest Management policy to reduce the threats of pests and vermin to collections, pest eradication processes are carefully selected to take into account the sacred nature of the shrines. For some religious groups, certain pest control methods such as freezing and anoxia are considered just as deadly to the sacred nature of the object as to pests; therefore, they should not be undertaken if the appropriate religious community forbids them. Lights should only be used when needed, and should be kept as dim as possible. Frequent careful cleanings, combined with dust covers, will reduce the danger of pollutants. Cleaning should be done with a soft cotton cloth or cosmetic brush, and a mild detergent and water if necessary.\n\nBest practice in museum handling of collection objects, such as shrines, dictates that objects be moved as little as possible. Shrines are frequently large, with intricate carvings, and there is significant risk of breakage through moving them. When handling or moving is necessary, it is done with careful planning - gloves, typically nitrile or cotton, are worn to prevent transferring pollutants on the hands to the shrine.\n\nLighting presents an additional challenge, since the object must be visible to viewers. Lights are kept as low as possible while still being bright enough to allow visitors to navigate the room and see the shrine. Sometimes lights will only be turned on when the shrine display is open to the public. UV filters are typically installed on artificial lights and window glass to prevent UV light from sun causing damage.\n\nDue to the religious nature of household shrines, in addition to determining the extent of the damage, conservation professionals advocate researching the spiritual nature of the shrine before restoration work begins. A recommended starting point is to ask why something is being conserved. There are multiple approaches to conservation and restoration, and this initial question is a preferred guideline for deciding which approach to take. There are two possible approaches to restoration of household religious objects: materials-based and values-based. Materials-based restoration refers simply to fixing what is broken: the materials are damaged, so they will be fixed. Values-based restoration is concerned with preserving the “intangible” qualities of an object—in this case, its religious properties. This approach involves not removing evidence of use on the object as long as it is not contributing to its deterioration. Values-based is the approach most often argued for, but it is noted that a combination of the two types is frequently the most appropriate.\n\nWood restoration can be an invasive process: to repair warping, for example, shallow cuts are often made in the surface of the wood to allow it to be pulled back into its original position and secured in place. Cracks can be filled with adhesive to both disguise them and prevent them from expanding, while holes or missing pieces are typically patched with replica parts. Wood that has been bleached may be re-stained or inpainted to match the undamaged areas.\n\nLoosened or flaking paint can be consolidated by injecting it with adhesive. Scratches can be inpainted, or repainted to reduce their appearance. Painted surfaces may be carefully cleaned with solvents to ensure that only the grime is removed and not the paint layer underneath. Lacquer that has delaminated from the paint layer may be glued back into place.\n\nConservation and museum display of religious objects, like household shrines, represents two ideologies in conflict. Museums are secular spaces, and restoration is secular work, but family shrines are sacred. The education and aesthetic-focused missions of museums and conservators are inherently at odds with the religious, family, and social functions of household altars. Restoring a shrine for museum display and putting it on exhibit affects its function: it becomes art to those outside its subject religion, but to adherents it can retain its status as an object of veneration even after being removed from its original context.\nIn addition to these differing principles that affect how a shrine is perceived, religious communities may have restrictions on what actions are appropriate for storage, restoration, and exhibition. For example, Buddhist writings and inscriptions show evidence of ongoing upkeep on ancient shrines and temples, indicating a prescription within the faith to maintain holy objects. Similarly, Jainic texts indicate that building a new shrine gives karmic reward, but a larger karmic reward is given for restoring an old shrine. Hinduism, by contrast, commands that shrines and statues be worthy receptacles for the gods: if they become damaged, some Hindu groups believe, they should be ritually destroyed and replaced. Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism not only vary from each other in their approaches to restoration, but groups and individuals within the religions may differ as well. As such, ethical standards state that the conservation methods undertaken for one object should not be applied to another, however similar, without consultation with the source religious community.\n\nMultiple conservation organizations, including the Western Association for Art Conservation (WAAC) and the International Centre for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments (ICCROM), state that a goal of conservation is to preserve the intangible qualities of an object as well as the tangible, physical qualities. To fully understand these intangible qualities, consultation with members of the religious community is necessary.\n\nIn addition to the preventative conservation methods described earlier, consultation with religious communities may disclose traditional or ritual care practices that the subject religion requires for sacred objects. These measure could include directives on how objects can be stored, who can handle them, and what—if any—restorative measures can be taken. Ritual care has the potential to prescribe religious practices to museum staff members who are not adherents of the subject religion; to avoid this, a recommended practice is active practice and passive accommodation: active practice refers to actions and behaviors with the object that can only be undertaken by a knowledgeable practitioner, while passive accommodation refers to the museum staff allowing the practitioner to conduct the practice within the museum space. Conservators and other museum professionals should be prepared to conduct restoration best practices within the confines of what the religious representatives allow.\n\nMuseum and conservation professionals take several different stances on how best to approach the care of religious objects. The Victoria and Albert Museum in the United Kingdom, for example, provides all of its staff conservators with an Ethics Checklist that, among other measures, prescribes consultation with a number of interested parties before conservation begins, and asks conservators to consider how their actions will affect the “identity and significance of the object(s)”. Similarly, the Government of Canada promotes an imperative of “respectful care”, wherein conservators fit their best practices into standards of care required by cultural representatives. ICCROM takes an even more culturally-centered approach, stating that the entire conservation process, including the decision to conserve, should originate with and be directed by the source religious community. Others suggest that consultation can go both ways, with religious representatives educating conservationists on proper care of the shrines, while conservationists can education the faithful on what their work entails to ensure that no boundaries are overstepped. From an exhibition standpoint, some recommend advocating for the religious aspects of these objects by creating more immersive museum displays that promote and explain the devotional qualities of the shrines instead of reducing them to aesthetics. The WAAC, for its part, advocates presenting the source community with all possible options regarding care and treatment of the object in question and letting the final decision rest with the community. As this illustrates, although the bulk of museum and conservation organizations recommend consultation with religious representatives, as yet there is no complete consensus on the best ways to ethically care for and restore religious objects.\n\nThe Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art spent more than a year restoring a Jain household shrine that had been in storage for over 70 years. Analysis of the shrine revealed two paint layers underneath the surface dirt: the original layer from the 16th century, and a later coating from the 1800s. The decision was made by the conservators to remove only the surface grime and not attempt to remove the later paint layer: Jainism gives greater spiritual reward for restoring an old shrine than building a new one, so the conservators opted not to undo the spiritual work of the individual(s) who did the 1800s repainting. The shrine has been on display in the Nelson-Atkins Asian Art gallery since 2014.\n\nThe Philadelphia Museum of Art acquired a one-hundred-year-old Tibetan home altar in 2004. At the time of acquisition, soot and oil from incense and lamp burning had built up on the surface. Consulting with Tibetan Buddhist sources revealed that such surface grime, though a direct result of ritual, is not in and of itself religiously significant and thus was safe to remove. The altar is on display in the museum’s Asian Art gallery.\n\nThe Newark Museum is also in possession of a Tibetan Buddhist altar; however, this one was built for the museum after the ritual destruction of a shrine dating from 1935. That shrine had also been built as a display piece for the museum and was never consecrated, but the presence of Tibetan ritual objects surrounding it had, in the opinion of religious representatives, sanctified the altar nonetheless. When the decision was made to replace it, a deconsecration ceremony was held by a Buddhist official, and the shrine was dismantled. The new shrine was designed and built by a Tibetan artist.\n\n \n"}

{"id": "28114726", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28114726", "title": "Employment discrimination against persons with criminal records in the United States", "text": "Employment discrimination against persons with criminal records in the United States\n\nEmployment discrimination against persons with criminal records in the United States has been illegal since passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Employers may lawfully consider an applicant's or employee's criminal conviction(s) for employment purposes e.g., hiring, retention, promotion, benefits, and delegated duties. That said, blanket policies or practices e.g., exclusion of all job applicants with convictions from hiring may violate the Act due to the disparate impact on some minorities protected by the act who might have as a subpopulation higher rates of criminal convictions and arrests. Likewise, policies or practices that are not sufficiently narrowly tailored for legitimate business necessity may be violations of the Act—if the discriminatory treatment or impact falls predominantly upon those persons protected by the Act. Title VII applies to businesses with more than 15 employees and defines two types of discrimination, disparate treatment and disparate impact. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has been enforcing Title VII since it came into effect in 1965. It has periodically issued an enforcement guidance explaining how employers could use criminal records without violating the Civil Rights Act; in April 2012 it published an enforcement guidance requiring companies to establish procedures to show that they are not using criminal records to discriminate by race or national origin.\nThe size of the problem is unknown.\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes some forms of discrimination against certain categories of persons in the United States illegal. It defines two types of discrimination: disparate treatment and disparate impact. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), who has been enforcing Title VII since it came into effect in 1965, has periodically issued an 'enforcement guidance' explaining how employers could use criminal records without violating the Civil Rights Act; \nAs of 1998, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had interpreted the Civil Rights Act to require that, where an employment policy which discriminates against criminals will have a disparate racial impact, employers must show a business necessity before automatically disqualifying criminals.\n\nIn April 2012 the EEOC published an enforcement guidance requiring companies to establish procedures to show that they are not using criminal records to discriminate by race or national origin. The EEOC indicated that they were investigating \"hundreds of charges related to the use of criminal history in employment\". EEOC endorsed removing a conviction question from the job application as a best practice in its 2012 guidance.\n\nMany statutes and regulations prohibit or restrict hiring criminals for many types of jobs, such as law enforcement including correction officers health care or education, the military as well as the Peace Corps and/or forbid licensing boards from granting professional licenses. Boards are often required to consider the applicant's moral character and some are authorized to consider criminal prosecutions which did not result in the applicant's actual conviction of a crime e.g., criminal charges dismissed as a result of deferred adjudication or other diversion program. Professions requiring licensing are increasingly numerous including barbers, locksmiths, electricians, general contractors subcontractors, and other trades and occupations involving work in private residences and businesses; or with vulnerable members of the public; for example daycare workers for children and seniors. Pilots of planes and ships, as well as drivers of passengers (bus and taxi) and cargo, tow truck drivers, as well as employees with access to airports, and other ports of entry. Emergency Medical Technicians and Paramedics, billiard room employees, attorneys, process servers, Notary Publics, Court Reporters, physicians, pharmacists, nurses, embalmers, septic tank cleaners, realtors, accountants, NASD/FINRA securities brokers (investment adviser representatives), insurance agents, bar owners (or restaurants owners with alcohol licenses), and sellers of alcoholic beverages, salvage dealers, pawn shop owners.\n\nAs of 2008, 6.6 to 7.4 percent, or about one in 15 working-age adults were ex-felons. According to an estimate from 2000, there were over 12 million felons in the United States, representing roughly 8% of the working-age population.\n\nThe Thirteenth Amendment explicitly makes slavery and involuntary servitude for criminals constitutionally permissible in the United States and its territories. Most Americans erroneously believe the 13th Amendment entirely prohibit the practice. The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires \"due process\" but further expressly permits loss of life, liberty, and property. Thus felony disenfranchisement as well as misdemeanor disenfranchisement. These provisions are moderated in that punishment can not be \"cruel and unusual\" which is prohibited by the Eight Amendment and by 18 U.S. Code § 1581 and 42 U.S. Code § 1994 which prohibits peonage. The Constitution, Article 1 Sections 9 and 10, also forbids Bills of Attainder but the U.S. Supreme Court has only construed the provision five times (differently) and only after the civil war. Collateral consequences of conviction although widespread and arguably legislation prohibited by Article 1 has thus seen very little substantial litigation. Moreover, there is a large body of case law that these civil statutes and regulations (collateral consequences) are not penal (criminal punishment) and thus not subject to the Constitution's Article 1 or Double Jeopardy 5th Amendment prohibitions. The entire constitution, on the subject-matter of criminal convictions, should be read in pari materia.\n\nThe counter-argument: It has been pointed out that constitutional approval of felons' political powerlessness is not the same as constitutional approval of government prejudice toward the politically powerless. Such prejudice may arguably violate the Equal Protection Clause, which itself contains no exclusionary provision authorizing discrimination against felons (although several other provisions explicitly authorize discrimination). A \"discrete and insular\" minority subject to prejudice, in particular, may be considered particularly vulnerable to oppression by the majority, and thus a suspect class worthy of protection by the judiciary.\nAs of 1998, seven states absolutely barred felons from public employment. Other states had more narrow restrictions, for instance, only covering infamous crimes or misdemeanors and felonies involving moral turpitude. Some laws have been criticized for being overinclusive;for instance, a law banning all criminals from working in health care jobs could prevent a person convicted of bribery or shoplifting from sweeping the halls of a hospital. California law provides that a criminal record can affect one's application for a professional license only if \"the crime or act is substantially related to the qualifications, functions and duties of the business or profession for which the application is made.\" Further, a certificate of rehabilitation can prevent a person from being denied a license solely on the basis that he has been convicted of a felony. \n\nTexas Administrative Regulations requires, for some licensing, that a variety of factors, such as the nature and seriousness of the crime, the relationship of the crime to the purposes for requiring a license to engage in the occupation, the amount of time since the person's last criminal activity, and letters of recommendation, be taken into account (even when the applicant has a felony).\nWhile such discretionary guidelines may exist (statutes and regulations), prospective licensees are often provided merely a sham process to better legitimize prejudicial licensure denial. For example, Texas allows an appeal from such licensing commission to an Administrative Law Judge but such judge has no authority to overturn the licensure denial (merely issue an advisory opinion). Further, the Texas Supreme Court has held there is no due process or open courts right to appeal from an administrative proceeding. Thus, the licensing commission's abuse of discretion or erroneous application of law is not genuinely subject to meaningful review and correction. Further, the incompletely cited regulations above, are significantly biased in favor of white privilege, including socio-economic factors, e.g., has the applicant been steadily employed, supported his/her dependents, paid all fines, court costs, restitution. Such licensing standards are particularly unfair to minorities due to lower overall rates on employment and higher rates of poverty and family instability. Further, whereas applicants may submit letters of recommendation from anyone, the regulation is expressly preferential if from the prosecutors, the warden, sheriff or police chief where the applicant resides, or the police who made the arrest. In most instances, due to high caseloads of urban courts, and rates of crime in urban areas, as well as the generally lower-socio-economic status of those convicted, most will lack both access to and community standing to garner such criminal justice officials to vouch much less prepare a written recommendation for them to be licensed. It also violates attorney ethics for an attorney (including a prosecutor) to speak directly to the client (including a criminal defendant) that is represented by opposing counsel. No less problematic, post-conviction licensing is outside the scope of representation for a court-appointed criminal defense lawyers and public defenders. The U.S. Supreme Court has also ruled except for deportation a defendant's lawyer is not constitutionally required to inform such client about adverse employment and licensing consequences.\n\nData on criminal histories are widely disseminated by private sector agencies. It is difficult for a job applicant to prove that a prospective employer illegally discriminated against the applicant based on information on expunged convictions or dismissed charges. Mississippi does not erase an individual's criminal history, but rather replaces \"Conviction\" with \"Dismissed in Furtherance of Justice\" in the disposition. Some state justice systems do not allow arrestees to deny arrests for which the charges were dismissed, and some do not allow those whose charges were expunged to deny the conviction. The convicted Sex Offender has a particularly difficult time based upon biases and generalizations that are associated with the label and criminal record. Legislators in States find themselves in precarious positions when approached to pass specific legislation for the protection of this type of discrimination. Common entertainment such as Law and Order SVU and Criminal Minds further distort the realities of threat or recidivism when it applies to rehabilitated offenders returning to citizenship in society.\n\nSome courts have rejected any notion that basing hiring decisions on criminal convictions constitutes any type of illegal discrimination.\n\n"}

Sarducci, a chain-smoking priest with tinted glasses, works in the United States as gossip columnist and rock critic for the Vatican newspaper \"L'Osservatore Romano\" (sometimes mentioned as \"The Vatican Enquirer\", a take-off of the tabloid \"The National Enquirer\").\n\nNovello created the character in 1973, after he purchased the outfit (consisting of big floppy black hat, white clerical collar, and a long, red-trimmed black coat with cape) for $7.50 at a St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Store. The character was featured in 1970s cartoons by the underground cartoonists Dave Sheridan and Fred Schrier, appearing in person in the early 1970s on \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\" and later in the 1975 \"Smothers Brothers\" TV show. His most prominent appearances were on \"Saturday Night Live\" in the late 1970s, during which time Novello was also a writer for the show. In the late 1970s, Father Guido Sarducci was featured on radio commercials for \"High Times\" magazine where he offered to perform blessings for a fee.\n\nOn his first appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\", a skit called \"How to Pay for Your Sins\" on a 1978 episode hosted by Richard Dreyfuss, he was on crutches from an injury suffered during a dress rehearsal sketch about hockey players. Most of his appearances on \"SNL\" have been on \"Weekend Update\", including one where he reported that \"The take at the shrines in Italy has gone down\" which he suggested correcting by creating \"Shrinemobiles\" and thus taking the shrines to where the people were, and another where he is sent to London to try to wake up Paul McCartney at 4:30 in the morning (11:30 in New York) by throwing coins, obnoxiously singing The Beatles and Wings songs, and finally, throwing a rock at the window (he says it works every time).\n\nOne of Sarducci's most memorable SNL pieces occurred on February 16, 1980, when he actually managed to corner Richard Nixon at 1 a.m. outside the former president's New York City home for an interview. A stunned looking Mr. Nixon did not respond to the one question that Sarducci managed to get out before the end of airtime: \"Mr. President, Mr. President, if you coulda be any animal in the world, whata would it be?\" \n\nSarducci has appeared in four cold openings in the 1979–1980 season (on episodes hosted by Steve Martin, Teri Garr, Elliott Gould, and Rodney Dangerfield), two commercial parodies (\"MX-5 Tampons\" on the 1981–1982 Christmas episode hosted by Bill Murray and \"Bocce Ball My Way\" on the last episode of the 1985–1986 season hosted by Anjelica Huston and Billy Martin), and two monologues on the 1985–86 season (the first hosted by Madonna in a pretaped sketch showing Madonna's wedding to Sean Penn (played by Robert Downey, Jr.) and the second on the Christmas episode of the 1985–86 season hosted by Garr as Sarducci's alter ego, Pope Maurice).\n\nSarducci also hosted two \"SNL\" episodes during the 1983-84 season (when Dick Ebersol was executive producer) and cameoed during two 1990s episodes, most notably on a \"Weekend Update\" segment where he reports on Pope John Paul II's missing wallet. Father Guido Sarducci has 31 appearances on \"SNL\", the most of any of the recurring characters.\n\nIn 1981 Novello made newspaper headlines when he visited Vatican City wearing the Father Guido Sarducci costume to do a photo shoot for \"Time\" magazine. After taking pictures in an area where photography was prohibited, he and his photographer, Paul Solomon, were arrested by the Swiss Guards and Novello was charged with \"impersonating a priest\". Although the guards attempted to confiscate the film from the shoot, Solomon managed to hand them the wrong film. The charges were later dropped. In the early 1980s, Novello was featured in ads promoting candidates for the priesthood. He listed one advantage of being a priest as getting first pick at the annual parish garage sale.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s Sarducci appeared on other television shows, including \"Fridays\", \"Late Night with David Letterman\", \"Married... with Children\", \"Unhappily Ever After\", \"Blossom\", \"It's Garry Shandling's Show\", and \"Square Pegs\". In 1980, Sarducci appeared in \"Gilda Live!\", a film and an album recording based on Gilda Radner's successful one-woman show which had been playing on Broadway. In 1983, he appeared in a music video for the Rodney Dangerfield song \"Rappin' Rodney\", where he gave Rodney his last rites on death row, and helped himself to Rodney's french fries from his last meal. In 1984, he appeared in a music video for the Jefferson Starship song \"No Way Out\". In 1995, he appeared as a priest trying to perform an exorcism in the movie \"Casper\". The same movie featured a cameo by his fellow \"SNL\" alumnus Dan Aykroyd as the Ghostbuster Ray Stantz.\n\nHe appeared on the 2002 album \"A Classic Rock Christmas\" performing the song \"Santa's Lament\" featuring Joe Walsh and Joe Vitale.\n\nThe character also appeared on the Handsome Boy Modeling School albums \"So... How's Your Girl?\" and \"White People\", telling biographical stories of the life of a professional male model in the latter. Novello also released two comedy albums as Sarducci: \"Breakfast in Heaven\" and \"Live at St. Douglas Convent.\"\nHe also appeared on the MSNBC show \"Countdown with Keith Olbermann\" on March 19, 2005, discussing \"The Da Vinci Code\" and his DaVinci Code Decoder Ring.\n\nIn Disney Studios' animated film \"\" released in 2001, Don Novello uses the voice and speech style of Father Sarducci to portray the character of demolitions expert Vinny Santorini.\n\nSarducci was present at the First Annual \"Geno Roast\" at the Aqua Turf in Southington, Connecticut. He gave the prayer of invocation and roasted the UConn Huskies women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma. He also made a guest appearance on the April 30, 2005, broadcast of NPR and Chicago Public Radio's \"Wait Wait… Don't Tell Me!\" news quiz show, commenting on the ascension of Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nHe appeared on \"The Colbert Report\" on June 23, 2010, claiming to have conducted an interview with Glenn Beck while visiting the Vatican.\n\nHe delivered the benediction at the Stewart/Colbert Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear from the Mall in D.C. on October 30, 2010. He was wearing his classic white clerical collar, a long red-trimmed black coat with cape, zebra vest/jacket and black beret.\n\n"}
{"id": "14700336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14700336", "title": "Federal taxation and spending by state", "text": "Federal taxation and spending by state\n\nThe ability of the United States government to tax and spend in specific regions has large implications to economic activity and performance. Taxes are indexed to wages and profits and therefore areas of high taxation are correlated with areas of higher per capita income and more economic activity.\n\nSpending is largely focused on areas of poverty, the elderly, and centers of federal employment such as military bases.\n\nThe ability of the government to tax and spend in specific regions has large implications to economic activity and performance. The main question behind this issue stems into three different approaches. First, federal spending should be neutral, meaning federal taxation should roughly equal expenditures. Second, it should be redistributive, meaning rich states should be taxed most heavily and poorer states should receive more benefits. Third, spending and taxation should be accidental \"per se\", meaning higher taxation should be performed based on income but with little relation to geographic region and spending should be done where it allows for the most efficiency. The main issue driving this research is the question between equity and equality (Leonard and Walder, Page 17).\n\nTypically, it is seen taxes are highly indexed to wages and therefore places of high taxation are geographically found in areas with higher per capita income. The problem with taxation indexed to wages is that it does not consider cost of living. In areas with higher per capita income, it is highly likely that the cost of living is also higher; for instance, this is the case in New York. The effect of not indexing to costs of living makes some states look wealthier compared to others. It is typical that states with low costs of living receive more in spending than states with high costs of living (Leonard and Walder, Page 19). After discounting income with costs of living, New York's poverty level increases a significant amount (Pear, Page 2). The significance level between high levels of poverty and high taxation may be arguable.\n\nSpending is not so easily located geographically. The breakdown of federal spending is done in the following ways: defense (military), non-defense discretionary, Social Security, Medicare, grants, and various other programs. Defense spending is the most volatile, as it is usually found to be higher in states with established defense contractors and other defense facilities. Areas of higher social insurance spending are typically seen in areas of larger elderly population. Social security is the dominant expenditure of per dollar federal expenditures.\n\nOther factors of spending are largely political in the sense that politicians who can effectively argue for more spending get the most spending for their states. Some trends of spending as of 1999 are as follows: defense spending in the South and the national capital, non-defense discretionary spending between the Midwest and the Rockies, most Medicare and Social Security is located in the East and Central/Midwest, and other assistance programs following the Appalachian Mountains from Louisiana/Mississippi to Maine (Leonard and Walder, Page 30).\n\nThrough fiscal year 2010, the Census Bureau produced the annual Consolidated Federal Funds Report, tracking Federal expenditures both geographically and by agency and program. As of 2011, funding for the Federal Financial Statistics program, of which the CFFR was part, was cut from the Federal budget. Private organizations such as the National Priorities Project and The Pew Charitable Trusts have since developed their own reports. (The tables below are from the 2014 Pew report.)\n\nThe balance of payments receipts has typically remained fairly stable over the past fifteen years with limited changes between those states with net benefits and those with net contributions. The Fisc states that the federal deficit increased due to human resource expenditures, increased tax cuts, and increased military expenditure during the 1980s. The Fisc further reports that in expectations and defense spending declined in the 1990s one would expect the expenditure per state to decrease along with the government. However, some states, such as Kentucky, Idaho and Oklahoma, actually saw large increases in defense spending, which increased their BOP. Overall, though, increases in non-defense spending were not on the same magnitude as the decline of defense spending (Leonard and Walder, Page 36–39).\n\nThe report argues that defense and Social Security and Medicare have a small negative correlation, and as a result large reductions in defense spending do not bode well for increases in spending on Social Security or Medicare. Defense expenditures tend to be the most volatile over time and state, however, total expenditures are roughly constant, which means that increases (decreases) in defense correlate with decreases (increases) in other non-defense and non- social insurance expenditures. Income taxes used to finance expenditures are not extremely volatile around the national average.\n\nDecrease in defense expenditure has been a large key to overall changes in expenditure, both in salaries for bases and for procurement of defense. Due to restructuring or closing military bases, as determined by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission, most states have incurred declines in defense spending via salaries. California, with 24 recommendations for closure or realignment, has had the largest decline in defense spending, which attributes to a loss of roughly $50 billion, given the population increase since the early 1980s. Most states have also seen decline in procurement defense spending, but eight states have seen it increase, and in Kentucky's case it has doubled (Leonard and Walder, Page 36-39, 44-47).\n\nSocial Security has increased in expenditure primarily in the Southern states. It was thought that since the largest expenditure is retirement aid that social security expenditure was following the elderly. However, this was not the case, as the data did not correlate between elderly population and increases in social security expenditure. Further expenditures in social security are caused by the increase in disability insurance. The Fisc argues that the later policy changes in the 1980s involving beneficiary eligibility may have a time lag, meaning the causes of those changes are just now being felt. Medicare costs have continued to increase as well as the population ages and as health care costs increase. Most of the increased expenditure has been seen in the south. Grants have increased, but have been relatively stable over the fifteen-year period taken into consideration. The largest increase has been in the form of Medicaid expenditures (Leonard and Walder, Page 47-54).\n\nThe changes in taxes have remained fairly stable over time, and are strongly correlated with income per capita per state. It follows that as state's per capita income rises, its tax receipt also increases. The data between changes in per capita taxes to the national averages in ratio to the changes in the per capita income to the national average has a correlation of .88 (Leonard and Walder, Page 56-57).\n\nThe monitoring of federal spending and taxation and its variation between states in the United States began in 1977 under a query run by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democratic senator of New York. The query was designed to determine whether the state of New York was paying more in taxes than it was receiving in federal spending. The determination is made by looking at an individual state's balance of payments (BOP), which is total income minus outlays.\n\nInitially, many thought New York was a net gainer, receiving more funding than it was paying out in taxes, because of large payments to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, but in actuality, those payments were interest payments on the United States federal debt, which were distributed to foreign individuals and governments for purchasing of US Treasury bonds (Leonard and Walder, Page 9). After separating those expenditures from actual expenditures in New York, it was found that the state was actually a donor. This event stimulated more controversy over the topic of spending and taxation.\n\nAfter the Federal Community Services Administration noticed the flaw in the balance of payments in New York, it revised its data and provided the revised data under the title \"The Geographical Distribution of Federal Expenditures\", which was used in determining the expenditures for this analysis. This is now entitled \"the Fisc\".\n\nThe US Constitution requires that direct taxes be apportioned to the states according to their population, so that per capita revenues from the states would be equal. Indirect taxes do not have this restriction. After a US Supreme Court case held that an income tax on income derived from property was in the same category as a direct tax on property, the 16th amendment was passed to allow indirect taxation on income in proportion to their income, from what ever source. Since that time, taxation as well as spending per capita has ranged widely between the states. (See table below). At the same time, one of the great controversies of national politics has become whether to increase or decrease federal spending and the size of the federal government, with Republicans largely in favor of decreasing its size and Democrats pushing to keep it the same or increase it.\n\nSeveral commentators have pointed out that the states that benefit the most by federal spending are the very states whose populations tend to vote for leaders who promise to reduce federal spending, while those that benefit the least from large government vote for politicians who promise to make it even larger at their expense. In other words, Democratic-leaning states tend to be net contributors to the federal budget while Republican-leaning states are more often net recipients of federal spending. Various explanations for this seemingly contradictory situation exist.\n\n\nUS taxation:\n\nMain article:\n\nTable:\n"}

It is in the Dún Urlainn (Dunurlin) parish and electoral division of the Dingle rural area (pop. 438, 2011 census).\n\nThe cove was named after the Ferriter family name, which derives from the Norman French \"le Fereter\". Walter le Fereter, the ancestor of many later Ferriters, is the first person known in the area with the name and probably arrived following other Normans from Dublin. He was mentioned twice in a plea roll of 1252. The parish of Dunurlin is also recorded as being in the Ferriter's possession, and the name also exists in the nearby village of Baile 'n Fhirtéaraigh (Ballyferriter).\nAt the northern limit, the bedrock around the Cove is Devonian (419.2-358.9 mya) in age, beginning with conglomerate sandstone and siltstone of the Pointagare group, then the Ballydavid sandstone formation and further south the medium-grained Farran sandstone formation. Furthest south the igneous Silurian (443.8–419.2 mya) rocks of the Foilnamahagh Formation are dominant, with lavas and pyroclastic remnants.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2017 (at Baile 'n Fhirtéaraigh), for January and July respectively, the mean temperatures are 8 C and 16C and the mean rainfall 207mm and 153mm; the highest and lowest mean wind speeds were 39.3 km/h (November 2009) and 14.3 km/h (July 2013) respectively, with the highest wind speeds generally in winter.\n\nExcavations performed in the late 20th century have provided evidence that people lived there during the Mesolithic.\nThe excavations at Ferriter’s Cove were conducted by Peter C. Woodman. They followed a find in 1983 by an amateur archaeologist of a flint knife, believed to be from the Neolithic period.\n\nWoodman's team found implements that dated the site to the late Mesolithic. These included a grindstone, marked sandstone pebbles, shell dumps, various hearths and five mudstone axes that had been deposited together. The site has been interpreted as following the model of ephemeral Later Mesolithic habitation of short term stays, and the dating suggests that the site was used intermittently over a millennium, with more or less three phases. While Ferriter's Cove contained no formal burials, several pieces of human bone and teeth were found, one dating to 4225–3950 BC, and the other to 4250–3980 BC.\n\nIn 2012, further research was published confirming evidence of Neolithic farmers at Ferriter's cove, providing the first evidence of farming in Ireland. The remains of cattle and sheep, the latter not native to Ireland, were investigated; carbon dating showed that they were alive c. 4350 BC.\n\n"}

Commercial GIS systems are very powerful and have touched many applications and industries, including environmental science, urban planning, agricultural applications, and others.\n\nPublic health is another focus area that has made increasing use of GIS techniques. A strict definition of public health is difficult to pin down, as it is used in different ways by different groups. In general, public health differs from personal health in that it is (1) focused on the health of populations rather than of individuals, (2) focused more on prevention than on treatment, and (3) operates in a mainly governmental (rather than private) context. These efforts fall naturally within the domain of problems requiring use of spatial analysis as part of the solution, and GIS and other spatial analysis tools are therefore recognized as providing potentially transformational capabilities for public health efforts.\n\nThis article presents some history of use of geographic information and geographic information systems in public health application areas, provides some examples showing the utilization of GIS techniques in solving specific public health problems, and finally addresses several potential issues arising from increased use of these GIS techniques in the public health arena.\n\nPublic health efforts have been based on analysis and use of spatial data for many years. Dr. John Snow (physician), often credited as the father of epidemiology, is arguably the most famous of those examples. Dr. Snow used a hand-drawn map to analyze the geographic locations of deaths related to cholera in London in the mid-1850s. His map, which superimposed the locations of cholera deaths with those of public water supplies, pinpointed the Broad Street pump as the most likely source of the cholera outbreak. Removal of the pump handle led to a rapid decline in the incidence of cholera, helping the medical community to eventually conclude that cholera was a water-borne disease. \n\nDr. Snow's work provides an indication of how a GIS could benefit public health investigations and other research. He continued to analyze his data, eventually showing that the incidence rate of cholera was also related to local elevation as well as soil type and alkalinity. Low-lying areas, particularly those with poorly draining soil, were found to have higher incidence rates for cholera, which Dr. Snow attributed to the pools of water that tended to collect there, again showing evidence that cholera was in fact a water-borne disease (rather than one borne by 'miasma' as was commonly believed at the time.\n\nThis is an early example of what has come to be known as disease diffusion mapping, an area of study based on the idea that a disease starts from some source or central point and then spreads throughout the local area according to patterns and conditions there. This is another area of research where the capabilities of a GIS have been shown to be of help to practitioners.\n\nToday’s public health problems are much larger in scope than those Dr. Snow faced, and researchers today depend on modern GIS and other computer mapping applications to assist in their analyses. For example, see the map to the right depicting death rates from heart disease among white males above age 35 in the US between 2000 and 2004. \n\nPublic health informatics (PHI) is an emerging specialty which focuses on the application of information science and technology to public health practice and research. As part of that effort, a GIS – or more generally a spatial decision support system (SDSS) – offers improved geographic visualization techniques, leading to faster, better, and more robust understanding and decision-making capabilities in the public health arena.\n\nFor example, GIS displays have been used to show a clear relationship between clusters of emergent Hepatitis C cases and those of known intravenous drug users in Connecticut. Causality is difficult to prove conclusively – collocation does not establish causation – but confirmation of previously established causal relationships (like intravenous drug use and Hepatitis C) can strengthen acceptance of those relationships, as well as help to demonstrate the utility and reliability of GIS-related solution techniques. Conversely, showing the coincidence of potential causal factors with the ultimate effect can help suggest a potential causal relationship, thereby driving further investigation and analysis (source needed?).\n\nAlternately, GIS techniques have been used to show a lack of correlation between causes and effects or between different effects. For example, the distributions of both birth defects and infant mortality in Iowa were studied, and the researchers found no relationship in those data. This led to the conclusion that birth defects and infant mortality are likely unrelated, and are likely due to different causes and risk factors.\n\nGIS can support public health in different ways as well. First and foremost, GIS displays can help inform proper understanding and drive better decisions. For example, elimination of health disparities is one of two primary goals of Healthy People 2010, one of the preeminent public health programs in existence today in the US. GIS can play a significant role in that effort, helping public health practitioners identify areas of disparities or inequities, and ideally helping them identify and develop solutions to address those shortcomings. GIS can also help researchers integrate disparate data from a wide variety of sources, and can even be used to enforce quality control measures on those data. Much public health data is still manually generated, and is therefore subject to human-generated mistakes and miscoding. For example, geographic analysis of health care data from North Carolina showed that just over 40% of the records contained errors of some sort in the geographic information (city, county, or zip code), errors that would have gone undetected without the visual displays provided by GIS. Correction of these errors led not only to more correct GIS displays, but also improved ALL analyses using those data.\n\nThere are also concerns or issues with use of GIS tools for public health efforts. Chief among those is a concern for privacy and confidentiality of individuals. Public health is concerned about the health of the population as a whole, but must use data on the health of individuals to make many of those assessments, and protecting the privacy and confidentiality of those individuals is of paramount importance. Use of GIS displays and related databases raises the potential of compromising those privacy standards, so some precautions are necessary to avoid pinpointing individuals based on spatial data. For example, data may need to be aggregated to cover larger areas such as a zip code or county, helping to mask individual identities. Maps can also be constructed at smaller scales so that less detail is revealed. Alternately, key identifying features (such as the road and street network) can be left off the maps to mask exact location, or it may even be advisable to intentionally offset the location markers by some random amount if deemed necessary. \nIt is well established in the literature that statistical inference based on aggregated data can lead researchers to erroneous conclusions, suggesting relationships that in fact do not exist or obscuring relationships that do in fact exist. This issue is known as the modifiable areal unit problem. For example, New York public health officials worried that cancer clusters and causes would be misidentified after they were forced to post maps showing cancer cases by ZIP code on the internet. Their assertion was that ZIP codes were designed for a purpose unrelated to public health issues, and so use of these arbitrary boundaries might lead to inappropriate groupings and then to incorrect conclusions.\n\nUse of GIS in public health is an application area still in its infancy. Like most new applications, there is a lot of promise, but also a lot of pitfalls that must be avoided along the way. Many researchers and practitioners are concentrating of this effort, hoping that the benefits outweigh the risks and the costs associated with this emerging application area for modern GIS techniques.\n\n\n"}

His mother was Magdalena Dobrovská (1733, (Czaslawsko, ), Bohemia 1797).\n\nHe received his first education in the German school at Horšovský Týn in Plzeň district, made his first acquaintance with the Czech language and soon made himself fluent in it at the Německý Brod gymnasium, and then studied for some time under the Jesuits at Klatovy. In 1769 he began to study philosophy at the University of Prague. In 1772 he was admitted among the Jesuits at Brno and was preparing for a Christian mission in India. However, the entire order was dissolved in the Czech lands in 1773 and Dobrovský thus returned to Prague to study theology.\n\nAfter holding for some time the office of tutor to Count Nostitz, he obtained an appointment first as vice-rector, and then as rector, in the general seminary at Hradisko (now part of Olomouc); but in 1790 he lost his post through the abolition of the seminaries throughout the Habsburg Empire, and returned as a guest to the house of the count. At this time, he wrote some of the most important works in Slavic studies, historiography and philology.\n\nIn 1792 he was commissioned by the Bohemian Academy of Sciences to visit Stockholm, Turku, Saint Petersburg and Moscow in search of the manuscripts which had been scattered by the Thirty Years' War, and on his return he accompanied Count Nostitz to Switzerland and Italy.\n\nIn the 1780s Dobrovský participated in the academic life of Prague.

As a child, he spent a good deal of time in England, staying with his grandmother Dame Isobel Cripps, widow of the English statesman Sir Stafford Cripps.\n\nAppiah's mother's family has a long political tradition: Sir Stafford was a nephew of Beatrice Webb and was Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer (1947–50) under Clement Attlee; his father, Charles Cripps, was Labour Leader of the House of Lords 1929–31 as Lord Parmoor in Ramsay MacDonald's government; Parmoor had been a Conservative MP before defecting to Labour. \n\nThrough his grandmother Isobel Cripps, Appiah is a descendant of John Winthrop and the New England Winthrop family as one of his ancestors, Robert Winthrop, was a Loyalist during the American Revolutionary War and migrated to England, becoming a distinguished Vice Admiral in the British Navy. Through Isobel, he is also descended from the British pharmacist James Crossley Eno.\n\nThrough Professor Appiah's father, a Nana of the Ashanti people, he is a direct descendant of Osei Tutu, the warrior emperor of pre-colonial Ghana, whose reigning successor, the Asantehene, is a distant relative of the Appiah family. Also among his African ancestors is the Ashanti nobleman Nana Akroma-Ampim I of Nyaduom, a warrior whose name the Professor now bears.\n\nHe lives with his husband, Henry Finder, in an apartment in Manhattan, and a home in Pennington, New Jersey. Appiah has written about what it was like growing up gay in Ghana.\n\nHis nephew is the actor Adetomiwa Edun.\n\nAppiah taught philosophy and African-American studies at the University of Ghana, Cornell, Yale, Harvard, and Princeton Universities from 1981 to 1988. He was, until recently, a Laurance S. Rockefeller University Professor of Philosophy at Princeton (with a cross-appointment at the University Center for Human Values) and was serving as the Bacon-Kilkenny Professor of Law at Fordham University in the fall of 2008. Appiah also served on the board of PEN American Center and was on a panel of judges for the PEN/Newman's Own First Amendment Award. He has taught at Yale, Cornell, Duke, and Harvard universities and lectured at many other institutions in the US, Germany, Ghana and South Africa, and Paris. Until the fall of 2009, he served as a trustee of Ashesi University College in Accra, Ghana. Currently, he is the professor of philosophy and law at NYU.\n\nHis Cambridge dissertation explored the foundations of probabilistic semantics. In 1992, Appiah published \"In My Father's House\", which won the Herskovitz Prize for African Studies in English. Among his later books are \"Colour Conscious\" (with Amy Gutmann), \"The Ethics of Identity\" (2005), and \"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers\" (2006). He has been a close collaborator with Henry Louis Gates Jr., with whom he edited \"Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African-American Experience\". Appiah was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1995.\n\nIn 2008, Appiah published \"Experiments in Ethics\", in which he reviews the relevance of empirical research to ethical theory. In the same year, he was recognized for his contributions to racial, ethnic, and religious relations when Brandeis University awarded him the first \"Joseph B. and Toby Gittler Prize\".\n\nAs well as his academic work, Appiah has also published several works of fiction. His first novel, \"Avenging Angel\", set at the University of Cambridge, involved a murder among the Cambridge Apostles; Sir Patrick Scott is the detective in the novel. Appiah's second and third novels are \"Nobody Likes Letitia\" and \"Another Death in Venice\".\n\nAppiah has been nominated for, or received, several honours. He was the 2009 finalist in the arts and humanities for the Eugene R. Gannon Award for the Continued Pursuit of Human Advancement. In 2010, he was named by \"Foreign Policy\" magazine on its list of top global thinkers. On February 13, 2012, Appiah was awarded the National Humanities Medal at a ceremony at the White House.\n\nAppiah currently chairs the jury for the Berggruen Prize, and serves on the Berggruen Institute's Philosophy & Culture Center's Academic Board.\n\nAppiah argues that the formative denotation of culture is ultimately preceded by the efficacy of intellectual interchange. From this position, his views on the efficacy of organizations such as UNICEF and Oxfam are notable for their duality: on the one hand he seems to appreciate the immediate action these organizations provide while on the other hand he points out the long-term futility of such intervention. His focus is, instead, on the long-term political and economic development of nations according to the Western capitalist/ democratic model, an approach that relies on continued growth in the \"marketplace\" that is the capital-driven modern world.\n\nHowever, when capitalism is introduced and it does not \"take off\" as in the Western world, the livelihood of the peoples involved is at stake. Thus, the ethical questions involved are certainly complex, yet the general impression in Appiah's \"Kindness to Strangers\" is one which implies that it is not up to \"us\" to save the poor and starving, but up to their own governments. Nation-states must assume responsibility for their citizens, and a cosmopolitan's role is to appeal to \"our own\" government to ensure that these nation-states respect, provide for, and protect their citizens.\n\nIf they will not, \"we\" are obliged to change their minds; if they cannot, \"we\" are obliged to provide assistance, but only our \"fair share,\" that is, not at the expense of our own comfort, or the comfort of those \"nearest and dearest\" to us.\n\nAppiah's early philosophical work dealt with probabilistic semantics and theories of meaning, but his more recent books have tackled philosophical problems of race and racism, identity, and moral theory. His current work tackles three major areas: 1. the philosophical foundations of liberalism; 2. the questioning of methods in arriving at knowledge about values; and 3. the connections between theory and practice in moral life, all of which concepts can also be found in his book \"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers\".\n\nOn postmodern culture Appiah writes, \"Postmodern culture is the culture in which all postmodernisms operate, sometimes in synergy, sometimes in competition; and because contemporary culture is, in a certain sense to which I shall return, transnational, postmodern culture is globalthough that emphatically does not mean that it is the culture of every person in the world.\"\n\nAppiah has been influenced by the cosmopolitanist philosophical tradition, which stretches from German philosophers such as G. W. F. Hegel through W. E. B. Du Bois and others. In his article \"Education for Global Citizenship\", Appiah outlines his conception of cosmopolitanism. He therein defines cosmopolitanism as \"universality plus difference\". Building from this definition, he asserts that the first takes precedence over the latter, that is: different cultures are respected \"not because cultures matter in themselves, but because people matter, and culture matters to people.\" But Appiah first defined it as its problems but ultimately determines that practicing a citizenship of the world and conversation is not only helpful in a post-9/11 world. Therefore, according to Appiah's take on this ideology, cultural differences are to be respected in so far as they are not harmful to people and in no way conflict with our universal concern for every human's life and well-being.\n\nIn his book \"Cosmopolitanism: Ethics in a World of Strangers\" (2006), Appiah introduces two ideas that \"intertwine in the notion of cosmopolitanism\" (Emerging, 69). The first is the idea that we have obligations to others that are bigger than just sharing citizenship. The second idea is that we should never take for granted the value of life and become informed of the practices and beliefs of others. Kwame Appiah frequents university campuses to speak to students. One request he makes is, \"See one movie with subtitles a month.\".\n\nAppiah has been a critic of contemporary theories of Afrocentrism. In his 1997 essay \"Europe Upside Down: Fallacies of the New Afrocentrism,\" he argues that current Afrocentricism is striking for \"how thoroughly at home it is in the frameworks of nineteenth century European thought,\" particularly as a mirror image to Eurocentric constructions of race and a preoccupation with the ancient world. Appiah also finds an irony in the conception that if the source of the West lies in ancient Egypt via Greece, then \"its legacy of ethnocentrism is presumably one of our moral liabilities.\" His critique of contemporary Afrocentrism has been criticized by some of its leading proponents, such as Temple University African American Studies scholar and activist Molefi Asante, who has characterized Appiah's work as \"anti-African.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2642696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2642696", "title": "Letters rogatory", "text": "Letters rogatory\n\nLetters rogatory or letters of request are a formal request from a court to a foreign court for some type of judicial assistance. The most common remedies sought by letters rogatory are service of process and taking of evidence.\n\nAnother reason why a court may require assistance from a foreign court is to obtain evidence from a witness. This evidence may be to answer questions relevant to the determination of an issue of fact, or for disclosure of documents.\n\nCourts usually have the power to subpoena witnesses only from within the jurisdiction of their own legislature unless they are aided by foreign legislative authority. For example, Alice in the United States, could not summon Jean from France to the US courthouse. Instead, the US court would issue a letter rogatory to a French court, which would then examine Jean in France, and send a deposition back to the requesting court.\n\nInsofar as requests \"to\" US courts are concerned, the use of letters rogatory for requesting the taking of evidence has been replaced in large part by applications under 28 USC 1782, or Section 1782 Discovery.\n\nIn many cases, the witness is willing to provide the testimony. However, the target court may compel the testimony of a witness who is unwilling to appear.\n\nIn the past, letters rogatory could not usually be transmitted directly between the applicable courts, and they had to be transmitted via consular or diplomatic channels, which could make the whole process very slow. There have been various international conventions in regard to service of process and taking of evidence.\n\nOne of the earliest conventions to simplify the procedure of letters rogatory was the 1905 Civil Procedure Convention, signed at The Hague. Drafted only in French, it was ratified by only 22 countries. Later conventions, created after the institution of the Hague Conference on Private International Law, which was drafted in both English and French, commanded more support.\n\nThe Hague Service Convention, ratified in 1965, enabled designated authorities in each of the signatory states to transmit documents for service to each other, bypassing the diplomatic route. This convention has been ratified by 60 states, including the United Kingdom and the United States, neither of which had ratified the 1905 convention. The Hague Evidence Convention, ratified in 1970, formalised procedures for taking of evidence. It has been ratified by 43 states. For situations exclusively among Member States of the European Union, two regulations (1348/2000 and 1206/2001) superseded the two Hague Conventions. The two regulations apply to each of the member states of the European Union with the exception of Denmark, which has opted out.\n\n"}
{"id": "2727605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2727605", "title": "Liberal Arts, Inc.", "text": "Liberal Arts, Inc.\n\nLiberal Arts, Inc. was the name of an unsuccessful corporation founded in late 1946, which intended to create a Great Books-based liberal arts college in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. It is notable for failing despite the involvement of four educators of stellar reputation, and an offer of an apparently generous endowment, later withdrawn under unclear circumstances.\n\nIn 1937, Stringfellow Barr and Scott Buchanan successfully established the Great Books curriculum at St. John's College Annapolis, Maryland, which continues to the present day. In 1946, Barr resigned the presidency of that institution \"with the hearty good wishes of the board of trustees\" to found a new college.\n\nAccording to Glen Edward Avery, Barr thought St. John's had grown too large and feared that its land was about to be seized by the U.S. Navy for its own academy. The first such threat had been made in 1940; St. John's was saved only by the direct intervention of President Roosevelt and Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox. A 1946 newspaper story says that \"the college's Damocles sword again threatened to drop in 1944, by which time St. John's had lost its two greatest friends in the government.\" The college's board of trustees was unable to get a definite answer from Congress, then in control of Federal land-taking, on whether St. John's land would be taken, and Barr wanted to secure \"a home free of the endless menace of eviction.\"\n\nCharles A. Nelson, in \"Radical Visions,\" his biography of Barr and Buchanan, says they were convinced that \"the navy would never accept final defeat... They were wrong, but their judgement at the time is hard to fault. No one who can recall the temper of those times will forget how powerful the navy was.\"\n\nSeveral sites were considered for the new college. The first choice was a site in New Lebanon, N.Y., occupied by the Darrow School, which refused to sell. The final choice was the estate of Dan Hanna (son of Mark Hanna) in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThe choice of this location may have been influenced by Scott Buchanan, who, according to Samuel Sass, was familiar with the area, having graduated in 1912 from Pittsfield High School. The site, officially known as Bonny Brier Farm, already contained eighteen buildings, including an inn, a dormitory, and a boathouse located on of lakeshore frontage on the lake known as Stockbridge Bowl. When the project was announced in 1946, Buchanan expected the institution to be open by September 1947, indicating that \"the present buildings are sufficient to answer its purposes for the opening and the number of students attending in the first year or two.\" The site was about a mile and a half from Tanglewood, home of what was then called the Berkshire Symphonic Festival; in fact, it was the venue for that festival in 1934 and 1935, the first two years of its existence.\n\nThe enterprise was launched with a $4.5 million endowment from Paul W. Mellon, son of Andrew W. Mellon. Mellon had attended St. John's as a freshman in 1939, despite already holding degrees from Yale and Clare College, Cambridge, and studied there until 1942 when he left to enter the Army.\n\nA corporation was formed, named \"Liberal Arts, Inc.\" Members of the corporation included Barr, Buchanan, famous educators Mark Van Doren of Columbia University and Mortimer J. Adler of the University of Chicago, two Pittsfield attorneys, and a legal secretary. Sass indicates that Robert M. Hutchins and Alexander Meiklejohn, former president of Amherst College and another \"great books\" luminary, also planned to join the college. The Hanna estate was purchased and deeded to the corporation in March 1947.\n\nThe Hanna farm property was later sold in 1948 to Hans Maeder , who founded the Stockbridge School on the site. The school, a private school for adolescents, operated from 1949 to 1976 and was notable for being completely racially integrated from its inception.. The Stockbridge School included Jackie Robinson's son among its attendees.\n\nIn August 1947, it was formally announced that the project was abandoned. Conflicting accounts of the circumstances subsequently transpired.\n\nThe stated reason was \"inability to secure funds for the extensive building program needed to provide an adequate physical plant.\" In more detail, the trustees of the Old Dominion Foundation—Mellon's fund \"felt it was unwise to authorize invasion of principal for fear that the remaining endowment would be insufficient to accomplish the purpose of the gift. It was also felt that under the circumstances it would be wiser to place the endowment with an existing institution capable of housing the educational project which Old Dominion was prepared to endow. No such institution was found and it is understood that the grant will revert to the general funds of the foundation.\"\n\nSass suggests that that was not the real reason, but does not say what the real reason was:\n\nA November 1947 article in the Springfield Republican says plainly that there was a conflict over politics:\n\nCharles A. Nelson devotes an entire chapter in \"Radical Visions\" to the episode. He tells a complex and detailed story which does not mention any political issues and essentially agrees with the publicly stated reasons. In his view, Barr and Buchanan overreached, and believed that Mellon would agree or had agreed to a plan much more ambitious than his original intention.\n\nNelson makes clear the depth of Mellon's interest; this was not a casual millionaire's whim. Mellon had read a 1940 article about St. John's in Life Magazine, and wrote in his autobiography that after reading the article he drove to Annapolis\n\nIn April 1946 Mellon wrote of an interest in \"setting up an initial endowment for the St. John’s Program\" but of being \"deterred from action by doubts as to whether St. John’s College could keep its campus.\" He therefore set up the endowment but left in Barr's hands as to where the endowment should go. If St. John's was likely to lose its campus,\n\nThe Navy issue was resolved in favor of the college, so it might have been expected that Barr would recommend using the endowment to fund the St. John's program. Instead, Barr and Buchanan decided to found a new college. Nelson notes that \"The grant letter did not envision starting a new college from scratch.\" Yet \"the speed with which the two moved from seeking an existing institution stronger than St. John’s to acquiring property for a new college seems to indicate that Barr made no significant effort to find such an institution.\" Nelson suggests a fundamental understanding, in which \"Mellon accepted the idea of a new college in the expectation that Barr could raise the additional funds to sustain it, whereas Barr interpreted Mellon’s acceptance of the substitution as a sign that he, Mellon, would supply the necessary additional funds.\" In a 1947 letter, Mellon wrote:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51304792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51304792", "title": "Lying press", "text": "Lying press\n\nLying press () is a pejorative political term used largely by German political movements for the printed press and the mass media at large, when it is believed not to have the quest for truth at the heart of its coverage. It can be considered synonymous with the term fake news.\n\nThe term \"Lügenpresse\" has been used intermittently since the 19th century in political polemics in Germany, by a wide range of groups and movements in a variety of debates and conflicts. Isolated uses can be traced back as far as the Vormärz period. The term gained traction in the March 1848 Revolution when Catholic circles employed it to attack the rising, hostile liberal press. In the Franco-German War (1870–71) and particularly World War I (1914–18) German intellectuals and journalists used the term to denounce what they believed was enemy war propaganda. The made its mission the fight against the \"lying press\" which it considered to be the \"strongest weapon of the enemy\". After the war, German-speaking Marxists such as Karl Radek and Alexander Parvus vilified \"the bourgeois lying press\" as part of their class struggle rhetoric. The Nazis adopted the term for their propaganda against the Jewish, communist, and later the foreign press. During the protests of 1968, left-wing students disparaged the liberal-conservative Axel Springer publishing house, notably its flagship daily Bild, as a \"lying press\".\n\nIn late 2014, the term was repopularised by the far-right political movement Pegida in response to what its protesters felt was a scornful treatment by the mainstream media, as well as biased press reporting on the rising migrant influx and other immigration issues. It was chosen to be the \"Un-word of the year\" for 2014 by a panel of five linguists and journalists of the \"Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache\" for \"wholesale defamation\" of the work of the media. President Joachim Gauck condemned the chanting of the slogan as \"ahistorical nonsense\", maintaining that in contrast to the Nazi and the GDR era the federal German press is not manipulative in character and \"covers events mostly in a correct and balanced way\".\n\nAlternative for Germany chair Frauke Petry accused the German media of \"defamatory\" coverage of her party at a party congress at Hanover, but said the party executive would use the term \"lying press\" sparingly, preferring the milder designation \"Pinocchio press\". Her fellow party member Björn Höcke criticized \"Lügenpresse\" as too sweeping a verdict for the journalistic profession, arguing instead for the alternative, phonetically very similar term 'Lückenpresse' (\"gaps press\"), which would describe more accurately reporting bias.\n\nGerman media detractors felt vindicated by the perceived lack of mainstream coverage of the 2016 New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany. Most media outlets ignored the mass assaults by North African migrants and only started reporting on them five days later, after a wave of anger on social media made covering them unavoidable. The delay in reporting on the incidents led to accusations that the authorities and the media attempted to ignore or cover up the migrant attacks to avoid criticism against the asylum and migration policy of the Merkel government. Former interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich (CSU) criticized the media for upholding a \"cartel of silence\": \"There's suspicion that they believe they don't have to report on such assaults, especially involving migrants and foreigners, for fear of unsettling the public.\" The German press codex forbids mentioning the religion or ethnicity of criminal suspects and offenders unless there is a \"factual connection\" to the crime.\n\nA 2015 poll by Infratest dimap found one-fifth of Germans using the term in reference to German media, including newspapers, radio and TV, while almost three-fourth do not employ the word. 42 percent have doubts about the media's credibility, whereas 52 percent believe its coverage to be reliable on the whole. According to a representative poll by the Allensbach Institute of the same year, 39 percent of adult Germans think that there is some truth to the criticism of Pegida that the mainstream press is distorting facts and concealing crucial information from the reader; in the new states of Germany this is even believed by 44 percent of the population. Another 2015 survey, by the weekly \"Die Zeit\", found that 50 percent of respondents did not trust the media coverage on the refugee crisis, 56 percent not on the Pegida movement, 63 percent not on the European debt crisis and 66 percent not on the Ukraine conflict.\n\n"}

Foley is a motivational speaker who exhibits characteristics that someone in that position would not typically have: whereas motivational speakers are typically successful and charismatic, Foley is abrasive, clumsy, and down on his luck. The character was popular in its original run and went on to become one of Farley's best-known characters.\n\nThe character's concept was first created by Bob Odenkirk. Farley had performed the character in other comedy groups before joining the cast of \"Saturday Night Live\". Farley named the character after one of his Marquette University rugby union teammates, who is now a Catholic priest in the Chicago suburb of Arlington Heights.\n\nMatt Foley appeared in eight \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches. Each sketch typically started with Foley brought into a specific situation by someone to speak to a group. In addition to his disheveled, overweight, and unstylish appearance, he exhibits poor social skills, frequently loses his temper, disparages and insults his audience, wallows in cynicism and self-pity, and presents a negative motivational message. Foley's trademark line is warning his audience that they could end up, like himself, being \"35 years old, eating a steady diet of government cheese, thrice divorced, and living in a van down by the river!\" In most sketches, whenever a member of his audience announces a personal accomplishment, Foley responds with mockery or belligerence: \"Well, la-dee-\"frickin\"-da!\", \"Whoop-dee-\"frickin\"-doo!\", or a similarly dismissive remark. The sketches usually feature Farley's physical comedy, such as the over-caffeinated Foley gesticulating wildly and leaping around, often breaking furniture.\n\nIn the character's debut, David Spade and Christina Applegate, who were playing teens supposedly in need of Foley's help, were visibly trying to stifle their laughter. Spade, in particular, spent most of the sketch with his hand covering his face. In the sketch, Farley's portrayal of Foley was so intense that he ended up falling onto the table in front of him, crushing it. The blooper was so popular that Farley turned it into one of his best-known routines and one which he would repeat many times, both as Foley and as other characters on \"SNL\" and in film during the remainder of his life and career, sometimes injuring himself in the process.\n\nAt the end of each sketch, he is usually rushed out of his speaking location, where the people left behind huddle together and comment on him, usually bemused and frightened. Though his intended message is always ruined by his bizarre presentation, his audience typically benefits from the experience, as they all don't want to be associated with Foley again. One departure sketch had George Foreman considering that he was too old and weak to continue boxing, and happening to walk by the river, where he comes across Foley's van. Foley does not go into his usual tirades, instead ordering Foreman to do all sorts of chores for him, such as grilling hamburgers, claiming the work is \"for dexterity\". When Foreman determines Foley is using him, he punches Foley, causing Foreman to realize he can still fight and ultimately going on to win the world championship. Foreman then recites this tale to Tim Meadows, who wonders aloud why he is cooking burgers for Foreman, only to be barked at, \"You know why! For dexterity!\"\n\nBeing a Wisconsin native, Farley was asked to portray the Matt Foley character at the 1994 Rose Bowl banquet. He delivered a comedic \"motivational speech\" to the Wisconsin Badgers football team, who were to face the UCLA Bruins that year and won the game, 21–16.\n\nPlans for a film version with Spade in a supporting role were shelved after Farley's death in 1997.\n\nTypically the outfit of choice for Matt is a blue-and-white plaid sport coat, a white dress shirt, a solid green necktie, black Horn-rimmed glasses, too-tight khakis, a wrist watch, dress shoes and has well-groomed blond hair. In prison, he dons blue jeans and a denim shirt with the inmate number \"3307\" while retaining his watch, glasses and a crucifix necklace (he also mentions a \"homemade tattoo of a van down by the river\"). While working as a mall Santa, he wears a stereotypical Santa outfit, complete with black snow boots.\n\nWhile he is well mannered and very good-natured, he has a very violent temper, usually yelling at his audience and making a fool of himself.\n\nHe seems to have somewhat of a sense of self-pity and anger about his own poor life choices. Despite this, he has a passion for his career as a motivational speaker, going as far as to travel to Venezuela to speak to teens, or move in with teenagers to watch over them after they were caught with a bag of pot (although this was partially because he got tired of living in his van down by the river). While in prison, he seems to be respected, and to have a good friendship with his cellmate Deshawn Powers, who refers to Foley as \"The OG of cell block C\".\n\nHe is fond of coffee and caffeine-based products. In almost every appearance, he mentions drinking espresso or coffee, or taking NoDoz and he even brings a duffel bag with a pot of coffee to the gym to teach a spinning class.\n\nHe also seems to be a strong believer in \"PMA\" (Positive Mental Attitude).\n\nThe character's debut performance (May 8, 1993) has been called one of the best segments in \"SNL\" history. The reception of the audience combined with visible stifled laughter from the performers on stage added to the popularity of the sketch. Notable physical gestures from Farley included what Spade referred to as “the thing with the glasses” when Farley lifted his glasses on and off of his face commenting, “Hey Dad, I can’t see real good, is that Bill Shakespeare over there?” and perhaps the most defining gesture was one that Farley saved for the live performance when he alternated hands adjusting his trousers, grabbing the hilt of his belt with one hand and the back of his pants with the other. In the sketch itself, Foley attempts to motivate two teens, played by David Spade and Christina Applegate, to get themselves “back on the right track” after the family’s cleaning lady finds a bag of marijuana in their dresser. Foley’s attempt to motivate them falls short when he constantly reminds them that the only thing they will ever amount to is “living in a van down by the river!” The sketch ends with Foley offering that the only solution to solve the family's problems is for him to move in with them; he leaves the house to get his things from his van and the family locks him out, finally reconciling and admitting to how much they love each other.\n\nA later performance (February 19, 1994) features Foley in prison attempting to motivate troubled teens in a scared straight program; he was imprisoned for three to five years for non-payment of alimony (consistent with him being “thrice divorced”). Before entering the sketch, Foley is introduced by his cellmate Deshawn Powers (Martin Lawrence) as “just finished a week in solitary, eating nothing but coffee beans.” Foley attempts to scare the juvenile delinquents by commenting in a slightly different manner that he “wished to dear God, that he was living in a van down by the river!” The sketch followed the usual Foley routine with him falling through the prison wall instead of a coffee table, which eventually led to his and the other inmates' escape.\n\nIn the only cold open featuring Foley (April 15, 1995), the character attempts to motivate a pair of Venezuelan teens. Foley attempts to get through to them by motivating them in their native Spanish, saying “¡Yo vivo en van circa de un rio!” However the teenagers father (Michael McKean) informs Matt that he and his children are fluent in English causing Foley to response \"¡Padre, dame un favor, y cállate su grande YAPPER!\" The sketch again features Foley mocking his audience, breaking household objects, and somehow succeeding in his motivational goals.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "332248", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332248", "title": "Megalith", "text": "Megalith\n\nA megalith is a large stone that has been used to construct a structure or monument, either alone or together with other stones. The word megalithic describes structures made of such large stones without the use of mortar or concrete, representing periods of prehistory characterised by such constructions. For later periods, the word \"monolith\", with an overlapping meaning, is more likely to be used.\n\nThe word \"megalith\" comes from the Ancient Greek ' (transliteration \"mégas\", meaning \"great\") and ' (transliteration \"líthos\" meaning \"stone\"). \"Megalith\" also denotes one or more rocks hewn in definite shapes for special purposes. It has been used to describe buildings built by people from many parts of the world living in many different periods. A variety of large stones are seen as megaliths, with the most widely known megaliths not being tombs. The construction of these structures took place mainly in the Neolithic period (though earlier Mesolithic examples are known) and continued into the Chalcolithic period and the Bronze Age.\n\nAt a number of sites in eastern Turkey, large ceremonial complexes from the 9th millennium BC have been discovered. They belong to the incipient phases of agriculture and animal husbandry. Large circular structures involving carved megalithic orthostats are a typical feature; e.g. at Nevalı Çori and Göbekli Tepe. Although these structures are the most ancient megalithic structures known so far, it is not clear that any of the European Megalithic traditions (see below) are actually derived from them. At Göbekli Tepe, four stone circles have been excavated from an estimated 20. Some measure up to 30 metres across. As well as human figures, the stones carry a variety of carved reliefs depicting boars, foxes, lions, birds, snakes and scorpions.\n\nDolmens and standing stones have been found in large areas of the Middle East starting at the Turkish border in the north of Syria close to Aleppo, southwards down to Yemen. They can be encountered in Lebanon, Syria, Iran, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia. The largest concentration can be found in southern Syria and along the Jordan Rift Valley, however they are being threatened with destruction. They date from the late Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age. Megaliths have also been found on Kharg Island and pirazmian in Iran, at Barda Balka in Iraq. \nA semicircular arrangement of megaliths was found in Israel at Atlit Yam, a site that is now under the sea. It is a very early example, dating from the 7th millennium BC.\n\nThe most concentrated occurrence of dolmens in particular is in a large area on both sides of the Jordan Rift Valley, with greater predominance on the eastern side. They occur first and foremost on the Golan Heights, the Hauran, and in Jordan, which probably has the largest concentration of dolmen in the Middle East. In Saudi Arabia, only very few dolmen have been identified so far in the Hejaz. They seem, however, to re-emerge in Yemen in small numbers, and thus could indicate a continuous tradition related to those of Somalia and Ethiopia.\n\nThe standing stone has a very ancient tradition in the Middle East, dating back from Mesopotamian times. Although not always 'megalithic' in the true sense, they occur throughout the Orient, and can reach 5 metres or more in some cases (such as Ader in Jordan). This phenomenon can also be traced through many passages from the Old Testament, such as those related to Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, who poured oil over a stone that he erected after his famous dream in which angels climbed to heaven (Genesis 28:10-22). Jacob is also described as putting up stones at other occasions, whereas Moses erected twelve pillars symbolizing the tribes of Israel. The tradition of venerating (standing) stones continued in Nabatean times and is reflected in, e.g., the Islamic rituals surrounding the Kaaba and nearby pillars.\nRelated phenomena, such as cupholes, rock-cut tombs and circles also occur in the Middle East.\n\nThe most common type of megalithic construction in Europe is the portal tomb – a chamber consisting of upright stones (orthostats) with one or more large flat capstones forming a roof. Many of these, though by no means all, contain human remains, but it is debatable whether use as burial sites was their primary function. The megalithic structures of Malta are believed to be the oldest in Europe, in particular Skorba Temples. Though generally known as \"dolmens\", the term most accepted by archaeologists is \"portal tomb\". However many local names exist, such as \"anta\" in Galicia and Portugal, \"stazzone\" in Sardinia, \"hunebed\" in the Netherlands, \"Hünengrab\" in Germany, \"dysse\" in Denmark, and \"cromlech\" in Wales. It is assumed that most portal tombs were originally covered by earthen mounds.\n\nThe second-most-common tomb type is the passage grave. It normally consists of a square, circular, or cruciform chamber with a slabbed or corbelled roof, accessed by a long, straight passageway, with the whole structure covered by a circular mound of earth. Sometimes it is also surrounded by an external stone kerb. Prominent examples include the sites of Brú na Bóinne and Carrowmore in Ireland, Maes Howe in Orkney, and Gavrinis in France.\n\nThe third tomb type is a diverse group known as gallery graves. These are axially arranged chambers placed under elongated mounds. The Irish court tombs, British long barrows, and German \"Steinkisten\" belong to this group.\n\nAnother type of megalithic monument, the single standing stone, or menhir as it is known in France, is very common throughout Europe, where some 50,000 examples have been noted. Some of these are thought to have an astronomical function as a marker or foresight. In some areas, long and complex alignments of such stones exist, the largest known example being located at Carnac in Brittany, France.\n\nIn parts of Britain and Ireland a relatively common type of megalithic construction is the stone circle, of which examples include Stonehenge, Avebury, Ring of Brodgar and Beltany. These, too, display evidence of astronomical alignments, both solar and lunar. Stonehenge, for example, is famous for its solstice alignment. Examples of stone circles are also found in the rest of Europe. The circle at Lough Gur, near Limerick in Ireland has been dated to the Beaker period, approximately contemporaneous with Stonehenge. The stone circles are assumed to be of later date than the tombs, straddling the Neolithic and the Bronze Ages.\n\nMegalithic tombs are aboveground burial chambers, built of large stone slabs (megaliths) laid on edge and covered with earth or other, smaller stones. They are a type of chamber tomb, and the term is used to describe the structures built across Atlantic Europe, the Mediterranean, and neighbouring regions, mostly during the Neolithic period, by Neolithic farming communities. They differ from the contemporary long barrows through their structural use of stone.\n\nThere is a huge variety of megalithic tombs. The free-standing single chamber dolmens and portal dolmens found in Brittany, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, Wales, and elsewhere consist of a large flat stone supported by three, four, or more standing stones. They were covered by a stone cairn or earth barrow.\nIn Italy, dolmens can be found especially in Sardinia. There are more than 100 dolmen dating to the Neolithic (3500–2700 BC) and the most famous is called \"Dolmen di Sa Coveccada\" (near Mores ). During the Bronze Age, the Nuragic civilization built c. 800 Giants' grave, a type of megalithic gallery grave that can be found throughout Sardinia with different structures. The earliest megalithic tombs in Sardinia are the circular graves of the so-called Arzachena culture, also found in Corsica, southern France and eastern Spain.\n\nDolmen are also in Apulia and in Sicily. In this latter region, they are small structures located in Mura Pregne \"(Palermo)\", Sciacca \"(Agrigento)\", Monte Bubbonia \"(Caltanissetta)\", Butera \"(Caltanissetta)\", Cava Lazzaro \"(Siracusa)\", Cava dei Servi \"(Ragusa)\", Avola \"(Siracusa)\", Argimusco in Montalbano Elicona (Messina). Dating to the early Bronze Age (2200–1800 BC), the prehistoric Sicilian buildings were covered by a circular mound of earth. In the dolmen of \"Cava dei Servi\", the archaeologists found numerous human bone fragments and some splinters of Castelluccian ceramics \"(Early Bronze Age)\" which confirmed the burial purpose of the artefact.\nExamples with outer areas, not used for burial, are also known. The Court Cairns of southwest Scotland and northern Ireland, the Severn-Cotswold tombs of southwest England and the Transepted gallery graves of the Loire region in France share many internal features, although the links between them are not yet fully understood. That they often have antechambers or forecourts is thought to imply a desire on the part of the builders to emphasize a special ritual or physical separation of the dead from the living.\nThe Passage graves of Orkney, Ireland's Boyne Valley, and north Wales are even more complex and impressive, with cross-shaped arrangements of chambers and passages. The workmanship on the stone blocks at Maeshowe for example is unknown elsewhere in northwest Europe at the time.\n\nMegalithic tombs appear to have been used by communities for the long-term deposition of the remains of their dead, and some seem to have undergone alteration and enlargement. The organization and effort required to erect these large stones suggest that the societies concerned placed great emphasis on the proper treatment of their dead. The ritual significance of the tombs is supported by the presence of megalithic art carved into the stones at some sites. Hearths and deposits of pottery and animal bone found by archaeologists around some tombs also implies that some form of burial feast or sacrificial rites took place there.\n\nFurther examples of megalithic tombs include the stalled cairn at Midhowe in Orkney and the passage grave at Bryn Celli Ddu on Anglesey. There are also extensive grave sites with up to 60 megaliths at Louisenlund and Gryet on the Danish island of Bornholm.\nDespite its name, the Stone Tomb in Ukraine was not a tomb but rather a sanctuary.\n\nIn association with the megalithic constructions across Europe, there are often large earthworks of various designs – ditches and banks (like the Dorset Cursus), broad terraces, circular enclosures known as henges, and frequently artificial mounds such as Silbury Hill in England and Monte d'Accoddi in Sardinia (the prehistoric step pyramid) .\nA lot of spirals are found through of Sardinia: the best known is \"Perda Pinta\" of Mamoiada.\n\nIt seems that spirals were an important motif for the megalith builders (see Megalithic Temples of Malta). They have been found carved into megalithic structures all over Europe, along with other symbols such as lozenges, eye-patterns, zigzags in various configurations, and cup and ring marks. While not a written script in the modern sense of the term, these symbols are considered to have conveyed meaning to their creators, and are remarkably consistent across the whole of Europe.\n\nIn Europe megaliths are, in general, constructions erected during the Neolithic or late stone age and Chalcolithic or Copper Age (4500–1500 BC). The megalithic structures of Malta are believed to be the oldest in Europe. Perhaps the most famous megalithic structure is Stonehenge in England. \nIn Sardinia, in addition to dolmens, menhirs and circular graves there are also more than 8000 megalithic structure made by a Nuragic civilisation, called Nuraghe: buildings similar to towers (sometimes with really complex structures) made using only rocks. They are often near giant's grave or the other megalithic monuments.\n\nThe French Comte de Caylus was the first to describe the Carnac stones. Pierre Jean-Baptiste Legrand d'Aussy introduced the terms \"menhir\" and \"dolmen\", both taken from the Breton language, into antiquarian terminology. He mistakenly interpreted megaliths as gallic tombs. In Britain, the antiquarians Aubrey and Stukeley conducted early research into megaliths. In 1805, Jacques Cambry published a book called \"Monuments celtiques, ou recherches sur le culte des Pierres, précédées d'une notice sur les Celtes et sur les Druides, et suivies d'Etymologie celtiques\", where he proposed a Celtic stone cult. This unproven connection between druids and megaliths has haunted the public imagination ever since. In Belgium, there are the Wéris megaliths at Wéris, a little town situated in the Ardennes. In the Netherlands, megalithic structures can be found in the northeast of the country, mostly in the province of Drenthe. Knowth is a passage grave of the Brú na Bóinne neolithic complex in Ireland, dating from c. 3500–3000 BC. It contains more than a third of the total number of examples of megalithic art in all Europe, with over 200 decorated stones found during excavations.\n\n\n\n\n\nNabta Playa at the southwest corner of the western Egyptian desert was once a large lake in the Nubian Desert, located 500 miles south of modern-day Cairo. By the 5th millennium BC, the peoples in Nabta Playa had fashioned an astronomical device that accurately marks the summer solstice. Findings indicate that the region was occupied only seasonally, likely only in the summer when the local lake filled with water for grazing cattle. There are other megalithic stone circles in the southwestern desert.\n\nNamoratunga, a group of megaliths dated 300 BC, was used by Cushitic-speaking people as an alignment with star systems tuned to a lunar calendar of 354 days. This discovery was made by B. N. Lynch and L. H. Robins of Michigan State University.\n\nAdditionally, Tiya in central Ethiopia has a number old megaliths. Some of these ancient structures feature engravings, and the area is a World Heritage Site. Megaliths are also found within the Valley of Marvels in the East Hararghe area.\n\nMegalithic burials are found in Northeast and Southeast Asia. They are found mainly in the Korean Peninsula. They are also found in the Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang in China, the East Coast of Taiwan, Kyūshū and Shikoku in Japan, Đồng Nai Province in Vietnam and South Asia. Some living megalithic traditions are found on the island of Sumba and Nias in Indonesia. The greatest concentration of megalithic burials is in Korea. Archaeologists estimate that there are 15,000 to 100,000 southern megaliths in the Korean Peninsula. Typical estimates hover around the 30,000 mark for the entire peninsula, which in itself constitutes some 40% of all dolmens worldwide (see Dolmen).\n\nNortheast Asian megalithic traditions originated in northeast China, in particular the Liao River basin. The practice of erecting megalithic burials spread quickly from the Liao River Basin and into the Korean Peninsula, where the structure of megaliths is geographically and chronologically distinct. The earliest megalithic burials are called \"northern\" or \"table-style\" because they feature an above-ground burial chamber formed by heavy stone slabs that form a rectangular cist. An oversized capstone is placed over the stone slab burial chamber, giving the appearance of a table-top. These megalithic burials date to the early part of the Mumun pottery period (c. 1500–850 BC) and are distributed, with a few exceptions, north of the Han River. Few northern-style megaliths in northeast China contain grave goods such as Liaoning bronze daggers, prompting some archaeologists to interpret the burials as the graves of chiefs or preeminent individuals. However, whether a result of grave-robbery or intentional mortuary behaviour, most northern megaliths contain no grave goods.\n\nSouthern-style megalithic burials are distributed in the southern Korean Peninsula. It is thought that most of them date to the latter part of the Early Mumun or to the Middle Mumun Period. Southern-style megaliths are typically smaller in scale than northern megaliths. The interment area of southern megaliths has an underground burial chamber made of earth or lined with thin stone slabs. A massive capstone is placed over the interment area and is supported by smaller propping stones. Most of the megalithic burials on the Korean Peninsula are of the southern type.\nAs with northern megaliths, southern examples contain few, if any, artifacts. However, a small number of megalithic burials contain fine red-burnished pottery, bronze daggers, polished groundstone daggers, and greenstone ornaments. Southern megalithic burials are often found in groups, spread out in lines that are parallel with the direction of streams. Megalithic cemeteries contain burials that are linked together by low stone platforms made from large river cobbles. Broken red-burnished pottery and charred wood found on these platforms has led archaeologists to hypothesize that these platform were sometimes used for ceremonies and rituals. The capstones of many southern megaliths have 'cup-marks' carvings. A small number of capstones have human and dagger representations.\n\nThese megaliths are distinguished from other types by the presence of a burial shaft, sometimes up to 4 m in depth, which is lined with large cobbles. A large capstone is placed over the burial shaft without propping stones. Capstone-style megaliths are the most monumental type in the Korean Peninsula, and they are primarily distributed near or on the south coast of Korea. It seems that most of these burials date to the latter part of the Middle Mumun (c. 700–550 BC), and they may have been built into the early part of the Late Mumun. An example is found near modern Changwon at Deokcheon-ni, where a small cemetery contained a capstone burial (No. 1) with a massive, rectangularly shaped, stone and earthen platform. Archaeologists were not able to recover the entire feature, but the low platform was at least 56×18 m in size.\n\nThe Indonesian archipelago is the host of Austronesian megalith cultures both past and present. Living megalith cultures can be found on Nias, an isolated island off the western coast of North Sumatra, the Batak people in the interior of North Sumatra, on Sumba island in East Nusa Tenggara and also Toraja people from the interior of South Sulawesi. These megalith cultures remained preserved, isolated and undisturbed well into the late 19th century.\n\nSeveral megalith sites and structures are also found across Indonesia. Menhirs, dolmens, stone tables, ancestral stone statues, and step pyramid structure called \"Punden Berundak\" were discovered in various sites in Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi, and the Lesser Sunda Islands.\n\nThe Punden step pyramid and menhir can be found in Pagguyangan near Cisolok. The Cipari megalith site also in West Java displays monoliths, stone terraces, and sarcophagi. The basic design of later Hindu-Buddhist temples structure in Java after the adoption of Hinduism and Buddhism by the native population has the punden step pyramid concept underlying. The 8th century Borobudur and 15th-century Candi Sukuh, for example, featured the step-pyramid structure.\n\nLore Lindu National Park in Central Sulawesi houses ancient megalith relics such as ancestral stone statues, mostly located in the Bada, Besoa and Napu valleys.\n\nMegaliths in South Asia are dated before 3000 BC, with recent findings dated back to 5000 BC in southern India. Megaliths are found in almost all parts of South Asia. There is also a broad time\nevolution with the megaliths in central India and the upper Indus valley where the oldest megaliths are found, while\nthose in the east are of much later date. A large fraction of these are assumed to be associated with burial or post burial rituals, including memorials for those whose remains may or may not be available. The case-example is that of Brahmagiri, which was excavated by Wheeler (1975) and helped establish the culture sequence in south Indian prehistory. However, there is another distinct class of megaliths that do not seem to be associated with burials.\n\nIn South Asia, megaliths of all kinds are noted; these vary from Menhirs, Rock-cut burial, chamber tomb, dolmens, stone alignment, stone circles and anthropomorphic figures. These are broadly classified into two (potentially overlapping) classes (after Moorti, 1994, 2008): \"Sepulchral\" (containing remains of the dead), or memorial stones where mortal remains along with funerary objects are placed; and \"Non-sepulchral\" including large patterned placement of stones over a wide area. The 'non-sepulchral' type is associated with astronomy and cosmology in South Asia and in other parts of the world (Menon and Vahia, 2010).\n\nIn the context of prehistoric anthropomorphic figures in India, (Rao 1988/1999, Upinder Singh 2008) note that it is unclear what these giant anthropomorphs symbolize. They usually occur in association with megalithic monuments and are located in megalithic burial grounds, and may have been connected with ancestor worship.\n\nMegaliths occur in many parts of Melanesia, mainly in Milne Bay Province, Fiji and Vanuatu. Few excavations has been made and little is known about the structures.\nThe megalith tomb Otuyam at Kiriwina has been dated to be approximately 2,000 years old which indicates that megaliths are an old custom in Melanesia. However very few megaliths have been dated. The constructions have been used for different rituals. For example, tombs, sacrifices and rituals of fecundity. Dance sites exist next to some megaliths. In some places in Melanesia rituals are continued to be held at the sacred megalith sites. The fact that the beliefs are alive is a reason that most excavations have been stopped at the sites.\n\nMegalithic structures in Micronesia reach their most developed form on the islands of Pohnpei and Kosrae in the Eastern Caroline Islands. On these two islands there was extensive use of prismatic basalt columns to build upland building complexes such as those at Salapwuk on Pohnpei and Menka on Kosrae. These building sites, remote from the ocean, appear to have been abandoned early. Megalithic building then shifted to constructing networks of artificial islands on the coast that supported a multitude of common, royal and religious structures. Dating of the structures is difficult but the complex at Nan Madol on Pohpei was probably inhabited as early as 800 c.a. probably as an artificial islands with the more elaborate buildings and religious structures added to the site from 1000–1400 AD.\n\nNan Madol almost certainly served as the economic, government and religious site for a centralized monarchy which is historically named the 'Saudeleurs'. By legend the Saudeleurs were from elsewhere, possibly in the south or west but no specific origin has ever been established. Nan Madol lost prominence and was later abandoned after the overthrow of the Saudeleur dynasty. The oral history suggests this overthrow was by a group of warriors from Kosrae. \nThe megalithic site at Lelu on the island of Kosrae, based on dating studies and oral history, rose to prominence about 1400 AD corresponding roughly with the fall of Nan Madol and endured for the next three hundred years or so. It was largely abandoned by the time of European contact.\n\nThe architecture at these Micronesian sites is characteristic and has little in common with other megalithic sites. Prismatic basalt columns were brought from a great distance to the artificial islands and the rock was stacked in a layers of stretchers and runners filled in the center with coral debris. This structure allowed creation of walls up to 10 meters in height with great durability. The presence of step pyramids in the south western corner of Nan Madol as well as in Lelu suggests some Melanesian influence but other structures such as the royal residence, the religious structures and common areas as well as the elaborate interconnecting system of canals has no parallel elsewhere in the Pacific region.\n\nMegaliths were used for a variety of purposes ranging from serving as boundary markers of territory, to a reminder of past events, and to being part of the society's religion. Common motifs including crooks and axes seem to be symbols of political power, much as the crook was a symbol of Egyptian pharaohs. Amongst the indigenous peoples of India, Malaysia, Polynesia, North Africa, North America, and South America, the worship of these stones, or the use of these stones to symbolize a spirit or deity, is a possibility. In the early 20th century, some scholars believed that all megaliths belonged to one global \"Megalithic culture\" (hyperdiffusionism, e. g. ‘the Manchester school’, by Grafton Elliot Smith and William James Perry), but this has long been disproved by modern dating methods. Nor is it believed any longer that there was a pan-European megalithic culture, although regional cultures existed, even within such a small areas as the British Isles. The archaeologist Euan Mackie wrote \"Likewise it cannot be doubted that important regional cultures existed in the Neolithic period and can be defined by different kinds of stone circles and local pottery styles (Ruggles & Barclay 2000: figure 1). No-one has ever been rash enough to claim a nationwide unity of all aspects of Neolithic archaeology!\"\n\nThe types of megalithic structure can be divided into two categories, the \"polylithic type\" and the \"monolithic type.\" Different megalithic structures include:\n\n\n"}

The show featured male amateur contestants (the \"Joes\") matching themselves against professional athletes (the \"Pros\"; mostly of retired male and female pro-athletes) in a series of athletic feats related to the expertise sport of the Pro they are facing. For its first three seasons, the show was hosted by Petros Papadakis. In the last two seasons, it was co-hosted by Michael Strahan and Jay Glazer. The first two seasons were filmed at Carson, California's Home Depot Center, which was referenced in aerial shots. Repeats can currently be seen on the El Rey Network.\n\nEach of the first nine episodes of \"Pros vs. Joes\" consisted of a team of five professional athletes, distinguished by their uniform color on the show.

For the first time, it became important what people thought, as forms of political contention changed.\n\nThe term \"public opinion\" was derived from the French \"opinion publique\" which was first used in 1588 by Michel de Montaigne in the second edition of his \"Essays\" (ch. XXII).\n\nThe French term also appears in the 1761 work \"Julie, or the New Heloise\" by Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\n\nPrecursors of the phrase in English include William Temple's \"general opinion\" (appearing in his 1672 work \"On the Original and Nature of Government\") and John Locke's \"law of opinion\" (appearing in his 1689 work \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\").\n\nThe emergence of public opinion as a significant force in the political realm can be dated to the late 17th century. However, opinion had been regarded as having singular importance since far earlier. Medieval \"fama publica\" or \"vox et fama communis\" had great legal and social importance from the 12th and 13th centuries onward. Later, William Shakespeare called public opinion the 'mistress of success' and Blaise Pascal thought it was 'the queen of the world.'\n\nJohn Locke in his treatise \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" considered that man was subject to three laws: the divine law, the civil law, and most importantly in Locke's judgement, the law of opinion or reputation. He regarded the latter as of the highest importance because dislike and \"ill opinion\" force people to conform in their behaviour to social norms, however he didn't consider public opinion as a suitable influence for governments.\n\nWilliam Temple in his essay of 1672, \"On the Original and Nature of Government\" gave an early formulation of the importance of public opinion. He observed that \"...when vast numbers of men submit their lives and fortunes absolutely to the will of one, it...must be force of custom, or opinion...which subjects power to authority.\"\n\nTemple disagreed with the prevalent opinion that the basis of government lay in a social contract and thought that government was merely allowed to exist due to the favour of public opinion.\n\nThe prerequisites for the emergence of a public sphere were increasing levels of literacy which was spurred on by the Reformation, which encouraged individuals to read the Bible in the vernacular, and the rapidly expanding printing presses. During the 18th century religious literature was replaced with secular literature, novels and pamphlets. In parallel to this was the growth in reading societies and clubs. At the turn of the century the first circulating library opened in London and the public library became widespread and available to the public.\n\nAn institution of central importance in the development of public opinion, was the coffee-house, which became widespread throughout Europe in the mid-17th century. Although Charles II later tried to suppress the London coffeehouses as \"places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers\", the public flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the Wits gathered round John Dryden at Will's Coffee House, in Russell Street, Covent Garden. The coffee houses were great social levellers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism.\n\nMore generally, coffee houses became meeting places where business could be carried on, news exchanged and \"The London Gazette\" (government announcements) read. Lloyd's of London had its origins in a coffeehouse run by Edward Lloyd, where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as Tories and Whigs, wits and stockjobbers, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the \"cits\" of the old city center. Joseph Addison wanted to have it said of him that he had \"brought philosophy out of closets and libraries to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea tables and in coffee houses.\" According to one French visitor, Antoine François Prévost, coffeehouses, \"where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government,\" were the \"seats of English liberty.\"\n\nGentlemen's clubs proliferated in the 18th century, especially in the West End of London. Clubs took over the role occupied by coffee houses in 18th century London to some degree, and reached the height of their influence in the late 19th century – some notable names were White's, Brooks's, Arthur's, and Boodle's which still exist today.\n\nThese social changes, in which a closed and largely illiterate public became an open and politicized one, was to become of tremendous political importance in the 19th century as the mass media was circulated ever more widely and literacy was steadily improved. Governments increasingly recognized the importance of managing and directing public opinion. This trend is exemplified in the career of George Canning who restyled his political career from its aristocratic origins to one of popular consent when he contested and won the parliamentary seat in Liverpool; a city with a growing and affluent middle class, which he attributed to the growing influence of \"public opinion.\"\n\nJeremy Bentham was an impassioned advocate of the importance of public opinion in the shaping of constitutional governance. He thought it important that all government acts and decisions should be subject to the inspection of public opinion, because \"to the pernicious exercise of the power of government it is the only check.\" He opined that public opinion had the power to ensure that rulers would rule for the greatest happiness of the greater number. He brought in Utilitarian philosophy in order to define theories of public opinion.\n\nThe German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies, by using the conceptional tools of his theory of Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft, argued (\"Kritik der öffentlichen Meinung\", 1922), that 'public opinion' has the equivalent social function in societies (\"Gesellschaften\") which religion has in communities (\"Gemeinschaften\").\n\nGerman social theorist Jürgen Habermas contributed the idea of \"Public sphere\" to the discussion of public opinion. The Public Sphere, or bourgeois public, is according to Habermas, where \"something approaching public opinion can be formed\" (2004, p. 351). Habermas claimed that the Public Sphere featured universal access, rational debate, and disregard for rank. However, he believes that these three features for how public opinion are best formed are no longer in place in western liberal democratic countries. Public opinion, in western democracy, is highly susceptible to elite manipulation.\n\nThe American sociologist Herbert Blumer has proposed an altogether different conception of the \"public\". According to Blumer, public opinion is discussed as a form of collective behavior (another specialized term) which is made up of those who are discussing a given public issue at any one time. Given this definition, there are many publics; each of them comes into being when an issue arises and ceases to exist when the issue is resolved. Blumer claims that people participate in public in different capacities and to different degrees. So, public opinion polling cannot measure the public. An educated individual's participation is more important than that of a drunk. The \"mass\", in which people independently make decisions about, for example, which brand of toothpaste to buy, is a form of collective behavior different from the public.\n\nPublic opinion plays an important role in the political sphere. Cutting across all aspects of relationship between government and public opinion are studies of voting behavior. These have registered the distribution of opinions on a wide variety of issues, have explored the impact of special interest groups on election outcomes and have contributed to our knowledge about the effects of government propaganda and policy.\n\nContemporary, quantitative approaches to the study of public opinion may be divided into 4 categories:\n\nThe rapid spread of public opinion measurement around the world is reflection of the number of uses to which it can be put. Public opinion can be accurately obtained through survey sampling. Both private firms and governments use surveys to inform public policies and public relations.\n\nNumerous theories and substantial evidence exists to explain the formation and dynamics of individuals' opinions. Much of this research draws on psychological research on attitudes. In communications studies and political science, mass media are often seen as influential forces on public opinion. Additionally, political socialization and behavioral genetics sometimes explain public opinion.\n\nThe formation of public opinion starts with agenda setting by major media outlets throughout the world. This agenda setting dictates what is newsworthy and how and when it will be reported. The media agenda is set by a variety of different environmental and newswork factors that determines which stories will be newsworthy.\n\nAnother key component in the formation of public opinion is framing. Framing is when a story or piece of news is portrayed in a particular way and is meant to sway the consumers attitude one way or the other. Most political issues are heavily framed in order to persuade voters to vote for a particular candidate. For example, if Candidate X once voted on a bill that raised income taxes on the middle class, a framing headline would read \"Candidate X Doesn't Care About the Middle Class\". This puts Candidate X in a negative frame to the news reader.\n\nSocial desirability is another key component to the formation of public opinion. Social desirability is the idea that people in general will form their opinions based on what they believe is the prevalent opinion of the social group they identify with. Based on media agenda setting and media framing, most often a particular opinion gets repeated throughout various news mediums and social networking sites, until it creates a false vision where the perceived truth can actually be very far away from the actual truth.\n\nPublic opinion can be influenced by public relations and the political media. Additionally, mass media utilizes a wide variety of advertising techniques to get their message out and change the minds of people. Since the 1950s, television has been the main medium for molding public opinion.\n\nThere have been a variety of academic studies investigating whether or not public opinion is influenced by \"influentials,\" or persons that have a significant effect on influencing opinion of the general public regarding any relevant issues. Many early studies have modeled the transfer of information from mass media sources to the general public as a \"two-step\" process. In this process, information from mass media and other far-reaching sources of information influences influentials, and influentials then influence the general public as opposed to the mass media directly influencing the public.\n\nWhile the \"two-step\" process regarding public opinion influence has motivated further research on the role of influential persons, a more recent study by Watts and Dodds (2007) suggests that while influentials play some role in influencing public opinion, \"non-influential\" persons that make up the general public are also just as likely (if not more likely) to influence opinion provided that the general public is composed of persons that are easily influenced. This is referred to in their work as the \"Influential Hypothesis.\" The authors discuss such results by using a model to quantify the number of people influenced by both the general public and influentials. The model can be easily customized to represent a variety of ways that influencers interact with each other as well as the general public. In their study, such a model diverges from the prior paradigm of the \"two-step\" process. The Watts and Dodds model introduces a model of influence emphasizing lateral channels of influence between the influencers and general public categories. This thus leads to a more complex flow of influence amongst the three parties involved in influencing public opinion (i.e., media, influencers and general public).\n\nThe most pervasive issue dividing theories of the opinion-policy relation bears a striking resemblance to the problem of monism-pluralism in the history of philosophy. The controversy deals with the question of whether the structure of socio-political action should be viewed as a more or less centralized process of acts and decisions by a class of key leaders, representing integrated hierarchies of influence in society or whether it is more accurately envisaged as several sets of relatively autonomous opinion and influence groups, interacting with representative decision makers in an official structure of differentiated governmental authority. The former assumption interprets individual, group and official action as part of a single system and reduces politics and governmental policies to a derivative of three basic analytical terms: society, culture and personality.\n\nDespite philosophical arguments regarding public opinion, social scientists (those in sociology, political science, economics and social psychology) present compelling theories to describe how public opinion shapes public policy and find myriad effects of opinion on policy using various empirical research methods. Moreover, researchers find that causal relationships likely run in both directions from opinion to policy and from policy to opinion. On the one hand, public opinion signals public preferences and potential voting behaviors to policymakers. This impact should be greater under more stable democratic institutions. It should be greatest in the realm of social policy because the public are highly motivated by potential goods and services they get from the state. On the other hand, social policy impacts public opinion. The goods and services the public gets via social policy builds normative expectations that shape public opinion. Plus, social policy constitutes the largest share of state spending budgets, making it an active and contentious political area. Together these theories suggest that causal effects are part of a feedback loop between opinion and policy. Using increasingly sophisticated methods, scholars are beginning to grasp and identify the feedback of opinion and policy and use this phenomenon to explain the path dependency of institutions.\n\nAs with public policy, public opinion also has a close relationship with foreign policy. There is much debate concerning what the relationship is, and the study of foreign policy's relationship with public opinion has evolved over time, with the Almond-Lippmann Consensus being one of the first attempt to define this relationship. Published before the Vietnam War, Almond and Lippmann argued that public opinion about foreign policy was unstructured, incoherent, and highly volatile, and that public opinion shouldn't influence foreign policy. More recent studies have rebuked the Almond-Lippmann Consensus, showing how people's opinions are generally stable, and that while individuals may not be entirely informed about every issue, they still act efficiently and rationally.\n\nPeople’s judgments about issues are often based on heuristics, which are mental shortcuts that allow rational decisions to be made quickly. Heuristics apply to public opinion about domestic as well as foreign policy. The deductive heuristic is one that relies on a person's core values and social groups. Delegative heuristics are influenced by figures of authority such as the media or president.\n\nAnother key theory about how people form their opinions on foreign policy issues is Hurwitz and Peffley's hierarchical attitudes model. They argue that it is structured, with core values providing the basis for postures which further influence the ultimate issue position.\n\nPublic opinion about foreign policy is measured in the same way that all public opinion is measured. Through polls and surveys, respondents are asked about their issue positions. Conclusions are drawn by researchers by applying the scientific method.\n\nAccording to Robert Shapiro, public opinion and policy-making are fundamental to a democracy, which is linked to electoral accountability, meaning that the leader who was elected \"will not deviate far from voters’ opinion\". A problem that arises when analyzing the data collected by researchers is how these issues that are \"important\" are selected when collecting the data about public opinion. It is hard to determine if there has been underdevelopment of certain issues. Another concern is how elites influence public opinion by persuasion and rhetoric, ultimately shaping policy-making. These two variables are ambiguous by nature and are hard to get to any conclusions, in most cases beyond the limits of research. Other variables to look at when analyzing the opinion-policy effect are the size of the majority public, election cycle time, degree of electoral competition, and the type of issue. For example, domestic affairs public opinion will be of greater importance than that of foreign affairs, because of the complexity.\n\nSince presidents have the ability to influence their political agenda, it is easier for them to respond to public opinion. Also, since they are not an institution (like Congress) they can \"shift the standards by which the public evaluates their performance in office – away from policy concerns and towards more symbolic activities, image, and personality.\"\n\nA study by James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs discusses how presidents collect their information for policymaking. They found that on one hand, they collect data about the public's preference on salient matters like crime and economy. This reflects a populist type of democracy where the government portrays respect toward the people's views and they are connected. On the other hand, government institutions and elites believe the general populations’ understanding of certain issued is limited, therefore they exercise autonomy when making these decisions.\n\nBaum and Kernell have stated that a challenge that modern presidents face when trying to persuade public opinion is that there is so many different types of media, that getting people's attention is hard. New media alternatives has also caused on effect on Presidential leadership as they now use them to be able to communicate younger generations, but targeting small groups of people.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33599991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33599991", "title": "Riot grrrl", "text": "Riot grrrl\n\nRiot grrrl is an underground feminist punk movement that began in the early 1990s in Washington state (particularly Olympia) and the greater Pacific Northwest. It also had origins in Washington, D.C. It is a subcultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk style and politics. It is often associated with third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as having grown out of the Riot Grrrl movement. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.\n\nRiot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, and female empowerment. Primary bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Skinned Teen, Emily's Sassy Lime and Sleater-Kinney, as well as queercore groups like Team Dresch and The Third Sex. In addition to a music scene and genre, riot grrrl is a subculture involving a DIY ethic, zines, art, political action, and activism. The riot grrrl movement quickly spread well beyond its musical roots to create vibrant “zine” and World Wide Web-based movement, complete with local meetings and grassroots organizing to end ageism, homophobia, weightism, racism, sexism and, especially, physical and emotional violence against women and girls. Riot grrrls are known to hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early and mid-1980s there were a number of groundbreaking female punk and rock musicians who later influenced the riot grrrl ethos. These included Siouxsie Sioux, Poly Styrene, The Slits, Au Pairs, The Raincoats, Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde, The Runaways/Joan Jett, The B-52's, LiLiPUT, Lydia Lunch, Exene Cervenka, Kim Gordon, Ut, Neo Boys, Bush Tetras, Y Pants, ESG, Chalk Circle, Fifth Column, Frightwig, X-Ray Spex, Scrawl, and Anti-Scrunti Faction. The 1980s also featured a number of female folk singers from New York whose lyrics were realistic and socio-political, but also personally intimate.\n\nDuring the mid-1980s in Vancouver the influential Mecca Normal fronted by poet Jean Smith formed, followed by Sugar Baby Doll in San Francisco whose members would all wind up in hardcore female bands. In 1987, the magazine \"Sassy\" premiered and dealt with tough subjects that conventional magazines aimed at teenage girls did not. An article \"Women, sex and rock and roll\" published by \"Puncture, edited by Katherine Spielmann,\" in 1989 became the first manifesto of the movement. In 1991, a radio program hosted by Lois Maffeo entitled \"Your Dream Girl\" aimed at angry young women debuted on Olympia, Washington radio station KAOS.\n\nDuring the early 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a sophisticated do it yourself infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement as a way to activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.\n\nIn 1991, young women coalesced in an unorganized collective response to several women's issues, such as the Christian Coalition's Right to Life attack on legal abortion and the Senate Judiciary Hearings into Anita Hill's accusations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Young feminist voices were heard through multiple protests, actions, and events such as the formative opening night of the International Pop Underground Convention and later L7's Rock for Choice.\n\nUses and meanings of the term \"riot grrrl\" developed slowly over time, but its etymological origins can be traced to the actual Mount Pleasant race riots in spring 1991. Bratmobile member Jen Smith (later of Rastro! and The Quails), used the phrase \"girl riot\" in a letter to Allison Wolfe describing the atmosphere among women in the city. Soon afterwards, Wolfe and Molly Neuman collaborated with Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail to create a new zine and called it \"Riot Grrrl\", combining the \"riot\" with an oft-used phrase that first appeared in Vail's fanzine \"Jigsaw\" \"Revolution Grrrl Style Now\". Riot grrrls took a growling double or triple \"r\", placing it in the word \"girl\", as a way to take back the derogatory use of the term.\n\nKathleen Hanna had been studying at The Evergreen State College in Olympia. She participated in a small collective art gallery called Reko Muse, which would frequently host bands like The Go Team and Some Velvet Sidewalk to play in between art exhibitions (partially just to keep the gallery running). Hanna started a band, Amy Carter (named after the daughter of the US President Jimmy Carter), with fellow gallery-founders Heidi Arbogast and Tammy Rae Carland. After touring with some other projects like Viva Knievel, she hooked up with The Go Team drummer and zinester Tobi Vail, who had been writing of her own experiences:\n\nI feel completely left out of the realm of everything that is so important to me. And I know that this is partly because punk rock is for and by boys mostly and partly because punk rock of this generation is coming of age in a time of mindless career-goal bands.\n\nThey started working together on another fanzine called \"Bikini Kill\", which, after recruiting friends Kathi Wilcox and Billy \"Boredom\" Karren, would eventually become a band.\n\nAllison Wolfe met Molly Neuman at the University of Oregon. Wolfe introduced Neuman to bands such as Beat Happening and The Melvins, Neuman introduced Wolfe to sociology classes and Public Enemy.\n\nThey began working on zines called \"Girl Germs\", and later \"riot grrrl\" with Tobi Vail, Kathleen Hanna and Jen Smith.\n\nIt was a really hippie town, and we were getting really politicized, but also really into this DIY thing, so we kinda started creating. 'Let's make our own fanzine!'\n\nWolfe and Neuman started frequenting shows by bands like Fugazi and Nirvana. In 1990, Calvin Johnson called them up and asked them to play a show on Valentine's Day with Some Velvet Sidewalk and the newly formed Bikini Kill. They accepted it as a dare and played the show at Olympia's North Shore Surf club. Guitarist Erin Smith joined in March 1991.\n\nFrom August 20 – 25, 1991, K Records held an indie music festival called the International Pop Underground Convention. A promotional poster reads:\n\nAs the corporate ogre expands its creeping influence on the minds of industrialized youth, the time has come for the International Rockers of the World to convene in celebration of our grand independence. Hangman hipsters, new mod rockers, sidestreet walkers, scooter-mounted dream girls, punks, teds, the instigators of the Love Rock Explosion, the editors of every angry grrrl zine, the plotters of youth rebellion in every form, the midwestern librarians and Scottish ski instructors who live by night, all are setting aside August 20–25, 1991 as the time.\n\nAn all-female bill on the first night, called \"Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now!\" signalled a major step in the movement. The lineup featured Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Nikki McClure, Lois Maffeo, Jean Smith of Mecca Normal, 7 Year Bitch, and two side projects of Kathleen Hanna: the first was Suture with Sharon Cheslow of Chalk Circle (DC's first all-women punk band) and Dug E. Bird of Beefeater, the second was the Wondertwins with Tim Green of Nation of Ulysses. It was here that so many zinester people who'd only known each other from networking, mail, or talking on the phone, finally met and were brought together by an entire night of music dedicated to, for, and by women.\n\nThe convention featured other bands such as Unwound, L7, The Fastbacks, The Spinanes, Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, Girl Trouble, The Pastels, Kicking Giant, Rose Melberg, Seaweed, Kreviss, I Scream Truck, Scrawl, Nation of Ulysses, Jad Fair, Thee Headcoats, and Steve Fisk, and spoken-word artist Juliana Luecking.\n\nBy the mid-nineties, riot grrrl had severely splintered. Many within the movement felt that the mainstream media had completely misrepresented their message, and that the politically radical aspects of riot grrrl had been subverted by the likes of the Spice Girls and their \"girl power\" message, or co-opted by ostensibly women-centered bands (though sometimes with only one female performer per band) and festivals like Lilith Fair.\n\nOf the original riot grrrl bands, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy and Huggy Bear had split in 1994, Excuse 17 and most of the UK bands had split by 1995, and Bikini Kill and Emily’s Sassy Lime released their last records in 1996. However, Team Dresch were active as late as 1998, The Gossip were active from 1999, Bratmobile reformed in 2000 and, perhaps most prolific of all, Sleater-Kinney were active - initially - from 1994 to 2006, releasing 7 albums.\n\nMany of the women involved in riot grrrl are still active in creating politically charged music. Kathleen Hanna went on to found the electro-feminist post-punk \"protest pop\" group Le Tigre and later The Julie Ruin, Kathi Wilcox joined The Casual Dots with Christina Billotte of Slant 6, and Tobi Vail formed Spider and the Webs. Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17 co-founded Sleater-Kinney at the tail end of the original movement, and reformed the band again in 2014 after an 8-year hiatus, while Bratmobile reunited to release two albums, before Allison Wolfe began singing with other all-women bands, Cold Cold Hearts, and Partyline. Molly Neuman went on to play with New York punk band Love Or Perish and run her own indie label called Simple Social Graces Discos, as well as co-owning Lookout! Records and managing The Donnas, Ted Leo, Some Girls, and The Locust. Kaia Wilson of Team Dresch and multimedia artist Tammy Rae Carland went on to form the now-defunct Mr. Lady Records which released albums by The Butchies, The Need, Kiki and Herb, and Tracy + the Plastics.\n\nRiot grrrl culture is often associated with third wave feminism, which also grew rapidly during the same early nineties timeframe. The movement of third-wave feminism focused less on laws and the political process and more on individual identity. The movement of third-wave feminism is said to have arisen out of the realization that women are of many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions and cultural backgrounds. The riot grrrl movement allowed women their own space to create music and make political statements about the issues they were facing in the punk rock community and in society. They used their music and publications to express their views on issues such as patriarchy, double standards against women, rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment.\n\nAn undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier answers the question \"What is Riot grrrl?\" with: \"[Riot Grrrl is ...] Because we girls want to create mediums that speak to US. We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy... Because we need to talk to each other. Communication and inclusion are key. We will never know if we don't break the code of silence... Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit.\"Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms. All three of these forms were claimed to be a source of empowerment for women in the movement.\n\nThe riot grrrl movement encouraged women to develop their own place in a male-dominated punk scene. Punk shows had come to be understood as places where \"women could make their way to the front of the crowd into the mosh pit, but had to 'fight ten times harder' because they were female, and sexually charged violence such as groping and rape had been reported.\"\n\nIn contrast, riot grrrl bands would often actively invite members of the audience to talk about their personal experiences with sensitive issues such as sexual abuse, pass out lyric sheets to everyone in the audience, and often demand that the mosh boys move to the back or side to allow space in front for the girls in the audience. The bands weren't always enthusiastically received at shows by male audience members. \"Punk Planet\" editor Daniel Sinker wrote in \"We Owe You Nothing\":\nThe vehemence fanzines large and small reserved for riot grrrl – and Bikini Kill in particular – was shocking. The punk zine editors' use of 'bitches', 'cunts', 'man-haters', and 'dykes' was proof-positive that sexism was still strong in the punk scene.\n\nKathi Wilcox said in a fanzine interview:\n\nKathleen Hanna would later write: \"It was also super schizo to play shows where guys threw stuff at us, called us cunts and yelled \"take it off\" during our set, and then the next night perform for throngs of amazing girls singing along to every lyric and cheering after every song.\"\n\nMany men were supporters of riot grrrl culture and acts. Calvin Johnson and Slim Moon have been instrumental in publishing riot grrrl bands on the labels they founded, K Records and Kill Rock Stars respectively. Alec Empire of Atari Teenage Riot said, \"I was totally into the riot grrrl music, I see it as a very important form of expression. I learned a lot from that, way more maybe than from 'male' punk rock.\" Dave Grohl and Kurt Cobain dated Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail (also respectively), and often played with Bikini Kill even after splitting with them; Kurt was a big fan of The Slits and even convinced The Raincoats to reform. He once said, \"The future of rock belongs to women.\" Many riot grrrl bands included male band members, such as Billy Karren of Bikini Kill or Jon Slade and Chris Rawley of Huggy Bear.\n\nMolly Neuman once summarized: \"We're not anti-boy, we're pro-girl.\" Riot grrrl concerts provided a safe haven for women, and often addressed issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality and female empowerment. For example, in Bikini Kill's \"Don't Need You\", they sing: \"don’t need you to say we’re cute/don’t need you to say we’re alright/don’t need your protection/don’t need your kiss goodnight\", rejecting stereotypical heterosexual relationship dynamics.\n\nInfluenced heavily by DIY culture, most bands' presentation subverted traditional or classically trained 'musicianship' in favor of raw, primitive, avant-lo-fi passion and fiercely deliberate amateurism: an idea growing rapidly in popularity, especially in the Olympia music scene, with bands like Beat Happening coining the slogans: \"Learn how to NOT play your instrument\" and \"hey, you don't have to sound like the flavor of the month, all you have to do is sound like yourselves\", arguing that traditional musical skill doesn't ultimately matter and should always be subservient to the passion, the fun and ideas in their music. This argument is similar to the ideological origins of punk rock itself, which started partially as an attempt to dissolve the growing division between audience and performer. These indie-punk bands (and riot grrrl bands in particular) were often ridiculed for \"not being able to play their instruments\", but fans are quick to counter that identical criticisms were often faced by the first-wave of punk rock bands in the 1970s, and that this DIY garage amateurism \"play just 'cause you wanna, no matter what\" attitude was one of the most appealing and liberating aspects of both movements.\n\nOther bands and artists associated with the riot grrrl movement in one way or another include - in the US - Slant 6, Sta-Prest, Sue P. Fox, Jenny Toomey, Adickdid, Tattle Tale, Jack Off Jill, The Need, Nomy Lamm, Lucid Nation, The Frumpies, Bangs, Crown for Athena, TummyAche, The Third Sex, Canopy, Cheesecake, Clever Boy (Annika Bentley) Growing Up Skipper, The Fucking Angels, Pagan Holiday, The Quails, Giant Kitty; in the UK, bands like Blood Sausage, Mambo Taxi, Voodoo Queens, Pussycat Trash, Golden Starlet, Witchknot, Frantic Spiders, Linus, Sister George, Lungleg, Sally Skull, Hello Skinny and Coping Saw (who featured Leeds fanzine writer Karren Ablaze); and in Brazil, bands like Dominatrix, Kaos Klitoriano and Menstruação Anarquika. In Tasmania, Australia – \"The Little Ugly Girls\" led by Linda J. Dacio identified with the riot grrrl movement. Letters between the band's drummer \"Sloth\" and Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill would soon see the bands share a stage in Hobart, Australia.\n\nThere were also many girl-centric or all-women punk and queercore bands of this era, such as Calamity Jane, 7 Year Bitch, Red Aunts, Autoclave, Thee Headcoatees, Spitboy, Scissor Girls, and Tribe 8, who did not self-identify with the 'riot grrrl' label, despite sharing similar DIY tactics and feminist ideologies.\n\nAs media attention increasingly focused on Grunge and Alternative Rock in the early nineties, the term \"Riot Grrrl\" was often applied to less political female or female-fronted alternative rock acts such as Babes in Toyland, The Breeders, The Gits, 7 Year Bitch, Hole, Lunachicks, Dickless, L7, PJ Harvey, Liz Phair, Veruca Salt, and even No Doubt - although the latter band formed and performed during this era, they began as a SoCal-based and non-Alternative\nSka/Punk/Oí group. They retained this style prior to, and after, their major label signing with The Beacon Street Collection and breakout album Tragic Kingdom, remaining as such through their debut studio album release, the assotiated and frontline solo tours, Festivals, plus the longtime collaborations with Sublime before the initial sound and style drifted into the other genres and the ultimate solo act from Gwen Stefani - and – although the term could arguably apply to L7 due to their involvement in the creation of Rock for Choice, a series of concerts and compilation albums designed to raise money and awareness for abortion rights and protection of women's health clinics. To their chagrin, riot grrrls found themselves in the media spotlight during 1992, accused of dragging feminism into the mosh pit in magazines from \"Seventeen\" to \"Newsweek\". Fallout from the media coverage led to resignations from the movement of people like Jessica Hopper, who was at the center of the \"Newsweek\" article. Kathleen Hanna called that year for \"a press block\". In an essay from January 1994, included in the CD version of Bikini Kill's first two records, Tobi Vail responded to media simplifications and mis-characterization of Riot Grrrl:\none huge misconception for instance that has been repeated over and over again in magazines we have never spoken to and also by those who believe these sources without checking things out themselves is that Bikini Kill is the definitive 'riot girl band' ... We are not in anyway 'leaders of' or authorities on the 'Riot Girl' movement. In fact, as individuals we have each had different experiences with, feelings on, opinions of and varying degrees of involvement with 'Riot Girl' and though we totally respect those who still feel that label is important and meaningful to them, we have never used that term to describe ourselves AS A BAND. As individuals we respect and utilize and subscribe to a variety of different aesthetics, strategies, and beliefs, both political and punk-wise, some of which are probably considered 'riot girl.'\n\nWriter/musician/historian/artist Sharon Cheslow said in EMP's \"Riot Grrrl Retrospective\" documentary:\n\nThere were a lot of very important ideas that I think the mainstream media couldn't handle, so it was easier to focus on the fact that these were girls who were wearing barrettes in their hair or writing 'slut' on their stomach.\n\nCorin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Sleater-Kinney said:\n\nI think it was deliberate that we were made to look like we were just ridiculous girls parading around in our underwear. They refused to do serious interviews with us, they misprinted what we had to say, they would take our articles, and our fanzines, and our essays and take them out of context. We wrote a lot about sexual abuse and sexual assault for teenagers and young women. I think those are really important concepts that the media \"never\" addressed.\n\nEven as the Seattle-area rock scene came to international mainstream media attention, riot grrrl remained a willfully underground phenomenon. Most musicians shunned the major record labels, devotedly working instead with indie labels such as Kill Rock Stars, K Records, Slampt, Piao! Records, Simple Machines, Catcall, WIIIJA and Chainsaw Records. The movement also figured fairly prominently in cassette culture, with artists often starting their own DIY cassette labels by as basic and spartan a means as recording their music onto cheap off-the-shelf boom-boxes and passing the cassettes out to friends, seldom charging anything beyond the cost of the actual tapes themselves.\n\nRiot grrrl's momentum was also hugely supported by an explosion of creativity in defiantly homemade cut and paste, xeroxed, collagey zines that covered a variety of feminist topics, frequently attempting to draw out the political implications of intensely personal experiences in a \"privately public\" space. Zines often described experiences with sexism, mental illness, body image and eating disorders, sexual abuse, racism, rape, discrimination, stalking, domestic violence, incest, homophobia, and sometimes vegetarianism. Grrrl zine editors are collectively engaged in forms of writing and writing instruction that challenge both dominant notions of the author as an individualized, bodiless space and notions of feminism as primarily an adult political project.\n\nThese zines were archived by zinewiki.com, and Riot Grrrl Press, started in Washington DC in 1992 by Erika Reinstein & May Summer. Others can be found anthologized in \"A Girl's Guide to Taking over the World: Writings from the Girl Zine Revolution\", for which actress/singer/musician/writer/performance artist Ann Magnuson of Bongwater fame wrote as a foreword:\n\nWhen I think of how much benefit my teenage self could have gained from the multitude of zines that have proliferated over the past decade, I weep for all the lost potential. Except for Joan of Arc and Anne Frank, the thoughts of teenage girls have rarely been taken seriously.\n\nBands would often attempt to reappropriate derogatory phrases like \"cunt\", \"bitch\", \"dyke\", and \"slut\", writing them proudly on their skin with lipstick or fat markers. Kathleen Hanna was writing \"slut\" on her stomach at shows as early as 1992, intentionally fusing feminist art and activist practices. Riot grrrls making political statements to reclaim phrases is a common theme among third-wave feminists. Not only did their music address the same issues as third-wave feminism, but they took a political stance against the oppression they were feeling.\n\nMany of the women involved with queercore were also interested in riot grrrl, and zines such as \"Chainsaw\" by Donna Dresch, \"Sister Nobody\", \"Jane Gets A Divorce\" and \"I (heart) Amy Carter\" by Tammy Rae Carland embody both movements. There were also national conventions like in Washington, D.C., or the Pussystock festival in New York City, as well as various subsequent indie-documentaries like \"Don't Need You: the Herstory of Riot Grrrl\".\n\nStarting during the fall of 2010, the \"Riot Grrrl Collection\" has been housed at New York University's Fales Library and Special Collections, as \"The Fales Riot Grrrl Collection\". The collection's primary mandate is \"to collect unique materials that provide documentation of the creative process of individuals and the chronology of the [Riot Grrrl] movement overall\". Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, and Becca Albee have donated primary source material, while Molly Neuman, Allison Wolfe, Kathi Wilcox, and Carrie Brownstein are expected to donate material shortly. The collection is the brainchild of Lisa Darms, Senior Archivist at the Fales Library. According to Jenna Freedman, a librarian who maintains a zine collection at Barnard College, \"It's just essential to preserve the activist voices in their own unmediated work, especially because of the media blackout that they called for\". Kathleen Hanna, while understanding no collection can replicate the concert experience, feels the collection is a safe place that will be \"free from feminist erasure\".\n\nThe \"Riot Grrrl\" movement has received criticism for not being inclusive enough. Riot Girls are often accused of being separatists: they want to form a life away from men and invent \"girl culture\". One major argument is that the movement focuses on middle-class white women, alienating other kinds of women. This criticism emerged early in the movement. In 1993, Ramdasha Bikceem wrote in her zine, \"Gunk\", \nRiot grrrl calls for change, but I question who it's including ... I see Riot Grrrl growing very closed to a very few i.e. white middle class punk girls.Musician Courtney Love has criticized the movement for being too doctrinaire and censorious:\nLook, you've got these highly intelligent imperious girls, but who told them it was their undeniable American right not to be offended? Being offended is part of being in the real world. I'm offended every time I see George Bush on TV!\n\nSome have suggested that, while riot grrrl bands worked to ensure their shows were safe spaces in which women could find solidarity and create their own subculture, they have excluded transwomen from events such as The Michigan's Womyn's Music Festival, which has a womyn born-womyn policy. Former members of Le Tigre have seen protests at shows for participating in the festival.\n\nThe legacy of riot grrrl is clearly visible in numerous girls and women worldwide who cite the movement as an interest or an influence on their lives and/or their work. Some of them are self-proclaimed riot grrrls while others consider themselves simply admirers or fans. There are many fansites and message boards for riot grrrl on the internet. In an age where Internet is the most accessible platform for individuals to express themselves, the Riot Grrrl online community has risen in popularity in recent years. Not only do these online platforms capture discussion regarding larger topics of systemic oppression, but they also provide space for girls to express smaller issues—the successes and challenges of their everyday lives. It is a forum that allows for self-determined feminism and genuine, open expression, a core part of the Riot Grrrl message that’s greatest power is giving girls the room to decide for themselves who they are. As both a purported musical genre and as a subculture, riot grrrl has been acclaimed as an influence on contemporary groups as varied as Kitten Forever, Skating Polly, The Shondes and The Ethical Debating Society. Besides that, the Riot Grrrl movement has been a strong influence not only for the punk-rock scene but also for other kinds of music. \n\nIn the foreword to \"Riot Grrrl: Revolution Girl Style Now!\" Beth Ditto writes of riot grrrl,\nA movement formed by a handful of girls who felt empowered, who were angry, hilarious, and extreme through and for each other. Built on the floors of strangers' living rooms, tops of Xerox machines, snail mail, word of mouth and mixtapes, riot grrrl reinvented punk.\n\nWriting about riot grrrl's personal influence on her and her music, she muses on the meaning of the movement for her generation, Until I found riot grrrl, or riot grrrl found me I was just another Gloria Steinem NOW feminist trying to take a stand in shop class. Now I am a musician, a writer, a whole person.\n\nMany women write to Hanna in hopes of reviving the Riot Grrrl Movement. Hanna says, “Don’t revive it, make something better\". In 2010 \"Girls to the Front: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution\", by Sara Marcus, was published. It is the first published history of the Riot Grrrl movement. Sara Marcus herself had attended Riot Grrrl meetings. As of now there are approximately ten weekly Riot Girl meetings nationwide, and bands multiplying faster than can be counted.\n\nIn 2013 Astria Suparak and Ceci Moss curated \"Alien She\", an exhibition examining the impact of Riot Grrrl on artists and cultural producers. Alien She focuses on seven people whose visual art practices were informed by their contact with Riot Grrrl. Many of them work in multiple disciplines, such as sculpture, installation, video, documentary film, photography, drawing, printmaking, new media, social practice, curation, music, writing and performance—a reflection of the movement's artistic diversity and mutability. It opened September 2013 at the Miller Gallery at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and ran through February the following year. It visited four subsequent museums (Vox Populi in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March – April 2014; Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, San Francisco, October 2014 – January 2015; Orange County Museum of Art, Newport Beach, California, February – May 2015; and Pacific Northwest College of Art: 511 Gallery and the Museum of Contemporary Craft in Portland, Oregon, September 3, 2015 – January 9, 2016).\n\nThe term \"grrrl\" (or \"grrl\") itself has since been co-opted or used by agencies as diverse as advocacy on behalf of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (GRRL POWER 1.0 5-PACK / Memetics for the Ladies) and a roller derby league in Singapore.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45222539", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45222539", "title": "Salvator Cupcea", "text": "Salvator Cupcea\n\nSalvator P. Cupcea (also known as Salvador Cupcea; August 8, 1908 – 1958) was a Romanian psychologist, physician, and political figure. From beginnings as a researcher for the Victor Babeș University of Cluj, alongside his friend Alexandru Roșca, he became noted as a pioneer of experimental psychology and psychoanalysis, studying in particular the social marginals. He later immersed himself in the social hygiene and eugenics movement, also specializing in genetic medicine, biological anthropology, and criminology. A collaborator of Iuliu Moldovan, he taught classes at the latter's Institute for much of World War II, when he focused on studying the intelligence of various body types.\n\nDuring those years, Cupcea flirted with fascism, and endorsed a biopolitical \"national hygiene\" program. In 1944, he reemerged as a supporter of the Romanian Communist Party and liberal eugenics, serving as Health Minister and representative to the World Health Organization. A founder of the Cluj Medical University and administrator of its Psychiatric Clinic, his final work was in human ecology, food science, and cardiology.\n\nSalvator was born in Carei (Nagykároly), Szatmár County, at the time part of Austria-Hungary. His was a family of importance in the Romanian Eastern Catholic community of Crișana region. His father, Petru Cupcea (1875–1940), was a priest, later the \"Protopope\" of Supur and honorary Archdeacon, who was active in the Romanian National Party from 1909. Although ethnically Romanian, his paternal and maternal ancestors, the Cupceas and the Rednics, had been received into the Hungarian nobility of Partium, tracing their aristocratic titles to 1609 and 1349 respectively. Petru's wife, Augusta, was the distant descendant of peasants from Tiream, and daughter of George Pteancu. A Romanian educator and honorary citizen of Carei, Pteancu was also leader of the Marian Congregation branch in Năsăud. Augusta's brother, Alexandru Coriolan Pteancu (1878–1956), was a theologian, antiquarian, schoolteacher, political figure, and honorary \"Protopope\".\n\nThe couple, who moved frequently in keeping up with Father Cupcea's successive assignments, had six children born in various localities, of whom Salvator and three sisters reached maturity. The eldest, Maria (1903–1980), was an educator, composer, and celebrated stage and film actress. She was for a while married one of Salvator's physician colleagues, Victor Munteanu, and had a son by him, Dan Munteanu, who became a noted biologist. Another sister, Lucia, became the wife of Leontin Ghergariu (1897–1980), a philologist, adult educator, museum curator and sports enthusiast. The youngest of the Cupcea siblings, Emilia, taught at the Biological Institute of Cluj.\n\nCupcea's early childhood saw the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the region's incorporation with Romania. Directly involved in the process, Alexandru Pteancu was appointed chief inspector of secondary schools by the Romanian-led Regional Directorate. There followed an interlude of Hungarian Soviet rule, during which Inspector Pteancu narrowly escaped execution. Father Cupcea, who had pledged Carei's support for the Great Assembly, was also targeted, being kidnapped and sent to Debrecen, where he was reportedly tortured. Rescued by his coreligionists, he made his way to Oradea, which fell to the Romanians in the military operations of 1919.\n\nIn 1925, when Crișana had been secured for Greater Romania, Salvator graduated from Carei's Lucaciu High School, where he had become best friends with his schoolmate, Alexandru Roșca. They both had a keen interest in psychology, and were urged on by their schoolteachers to pursue studies in the field. Enlisting at the University of Cluj (known back then as \"Upper Dacia University\"), they attended the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy, specializing under Professor Florian Ștefănescu-Goangă at the Cluj Institute of Psychology. Together, they worked on Ștefănescu-Goangă's applied psychology teams, alongside various other young men who became figures of importance on the scientific, political, and literary scene: Nicolae Mărgineanu, Mihai Beniuc, Liviu Rusu, Lucian Bologa, and Teodor Bugnariu.\n\nTaking a degree in Psychology, Pedagogy and Aesthetics (February 1931), Cupcea also attended the Faculty of Medicine, where he earned a diploma in psychiatry, after which he took a position on the staff of the Mental Hospital in Sibiu. In early 1935, he was among the founders of the Romanian Psychoanalytic Circle and an editor of its magazine, \"Revista Română de Psihanaliză\", with which he sought to promote a more complete understanding of Sigmund Freud and his work. Together with fellow Freudians Ioan I. Popescu-Sibiu, G. Preda, and Anastase Dosios, he worked on \"Cercetări de psihologie experimentală la alienați\" (\"Studies in Experimental Psychology among the Insane\").\n\nIn 1938, Cupcea became a contributor to Ștefănescu-Goangă's academic journal, \"Revista de Psihologie\", where he wrote an introduction to psychological evaluation techniques. Also that year, together with Ștefănescu-Goangă and Roșca, he published a study on \"Adaptarea socială\" (\"Social Adaptation\"), which looked into the social careers of misfits: 3,300 criminals, 9,636 victims of suicide, and 434 mental patients. The authors found that maladaptation was critical among women and Székelys, that most homicides occurred in Oltenia, southern Moldavia and Ciuc, and that most suicides were reported in Transylvania. With Mihai Kernbach and Vasile Hurghișiu, he co-authored other work in medical jurisprudence, presenting his findings at the 21 Congress of Legal Medicine, in Bonn. Cupcea ultimately became a Doctor of Medicine in March 1939.\n\nWhile Bugnariu affiliated with the underground Romanian Communist Party (PCdR), Cupcea and Roșca were drawn into fascist politics. As noted by author Nicolae Balotă, who was also an employee of the Psychology Institute, they \"contributed discreetly (and, what is more, prudently)\" to the Iron Guard. Cupcea's father, meanwhile, was a leader of the mainstream National Peasants' Party in Sălaj County and a figure of importance in local democratic circles, especially active in the propaganda effort against Hungarian irredentism.\n\nIn 1940, at the height of World War II, Northern Transylvania, including Cluj, was ceded by Romania to Hungary following the Second Vienna Award. The entire university and its logistics moved to Sibiu. Cupcea remained in contact with his colleagues, publishing in \"Revista de Psihologie\": in 1941, \"Constituția morfologică la bolnavii mintal\" (\"The Morphological Built of the Mentally Ill\"); in 1944, \"Încercarea unui sistem de psihopatologie constituțională evolutiv\" (\"Sketching a System of Progressive Bodily Psychopathology\"). He based these studies on the impact of health on intelligence, and the theories of Ernst Kretschmer, by examining the body types of university students, industrial workers and mental patients in relation to their intelligence quotient and state of mind, describing various correlations. A disciple of physician and eugenicist Iuliu Moldovan, he frequented ASTRA Society and published in its paper the 1941 tract \"Ce este Eugenia\" (\"What Eugenics Is\"). It discussed \"the improvement of the genetic dowry\" through both positive and negative measures. Quoting Moldovan and Francis Galton, Cupcea tried to delimit his field of interest from Nazi racial science (too radical) and euthenics (too mild), preferring Moldovan's term \"hygiene of the nation\". At the time, he expressed himself as a supporter of strict biological determinism, and demanded the universal introduction of prenuptial examinations to filter out the dysgenics.\n\nCupcea later became editor of \"Revista de Psihologie\", also serving on the staffs of \"Medicina Românească\" review and the Romanian Psychiatric Society. Described by his friends as a \"gentleman of imposing stature\" and a fine public speaker, he was attracted into teaching. From 1942, he hosted a seminar of \"mental hygiene\" and medical genetics, under Moldovan's guidance. In 1943, the university assigned him a lecturer's position in his alma mater, the Faculty of Medicine, where his oratorical skill drew in crowds. Cupcea also affiliated with Moldovan's Institute of Hygiene and Biopolitics, as a researcher, and, taking a diploma in Public Health and Hygiene in 1944, as a section leader. His studies merged psychiatry and criminology, investigating the role of emotional instability disorder as a gateway to other psychiatric conditions in the general population, and its supposed presence as \"impulsiveness\" among the criminal population.\n\nIn August 1944, King Michael's Coup aligned Romania with the Allies, while also ushering in a Soviet occupation. Discarding fascism, Cupcea and Roșca sought a rapprochement with the PCdR, passing themselves off as committed communists. ASTRA published Cupcea's introduction to \"Biologia teoretică şi aplicată în U.R.S.S.\" (\"Theoretical and Applied Biology in the USSR\"), which was a condemnation of scientific racism and social Darwinism, as well as a tentative defense of non-racial eugenics. The article announced that the era of eugenics as a separate discipline was coming to an end, as eugenics had infused the work values of Soviet biologists, especially those at the Maxim Gorky Medico-Biological Research Institute. In one of his eugenic tracts for that year, he circulated the notion that genes \"do not produce characteristics per se, but rather provide certain evolutionary guidelines\", which suggested to his readers that pedagogy had a major role in cultivating innate qualities.\n\nIn 1945, Cupcea joined the Health Ministry staff as a general secretary, under Premier Petru Groza and Minister Dumitru Bagdasar. On April 11, 1946, preparing for his retirement, Bagdasar delegated to Cupcea \"all the rights that come with the office of minister [...], excepting those that are strictly reserved for the minister as head of his department and cannot therefore be delegated.\" Following Bagdasar's resignation and death, Cupcea effectively became the acting minister.\n\nIn August 1946, he spoke at the national conference on people's health, where he presented a report on the dire conditions facing \"today's democratic government\": \"One million syphilitics, one and a half million gonorrhea victims, 600,000 tuberculosis victims, an 18 per cent infant mortality—that is the legacy of our past, the legacy of historical regimes\". In parallel, Cupcea was assigned the Chair of Mental Hygiene and Medical Genetics at the Cluj Hygiene Institute in September. On May 9, 1947, he was created a Commander of the Star of Romania.\n\nLater that year, he resigned from his political posts and became manager of the Cluj University Psychiatric Clinic, taking over from Iuliu Hațieganu, who had been purged by the communists. In 1948, when, with his help, the Faculty of medicine became a Medical University, he was made a full professor of hygiene, and soon after served as Dean. In parallel, he worked on a regional medical task-force formed by the Romanian Academy, while presiding over the Hygiene Institute, the Cluj clinics, and the local Medical Society. In 1948, he was one of three Romanian representatives to the founding congress of the World Health Organization, where he proposed the creation of a Mental Hygiene Committee and concrete backing for national research programs. For a while, he also headed a Cluj section of the Romanian–Soviet Institute. During those years, with Ștefănescu-Goangă and Roșca, he became involved in a cabal against their former colleague Mărgineanu, whom they denounced to the Securitate.\n\nWith Leon Daniello, Leon Prodan, and 11 other researchers, he contributed the monograph \"Silicoza și silicotuberculoza\" (\"Silicosis and Silicotuberculosis\"), which earned him the State Prize for 1952. He also worked alongside Aurel Moga in investigating cardiovascular disease, making significant predictions about the contributing role of cholesterol intake, and exploring connections between human ecology and biological anthropology. Later, Cupcea pioneered the study of ionization as an air pollution indicator. He died suddenly in 1958, at Cluj.\n\n"}
{"id": "1835064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1835064", "title": "Sociology of health and illness", "text": "Sociology of health and illness\n\nThe sociology of health and illness, alternatively the sociology of health and wellness (or simply health sociology), examines the interaction between society and health. The objective of this topic is to see how social life affects morbidity and mortality rate, and vice versa. This aspect of sociology differs from medical sociology in that this branch of sociology discusses health and illness in relation to social institutions such as family, employment, and school. The sociology of medicine limits its concern to the patient-practitioner relationship and the role of health professionals in society. The sociology of health and illness covers sociological pathology (causes of disease and illness), reasons for seeking particular types of medical aid, and patient compliance or noncompliance with medical regimes.\n\nHealth, or lack of health, was once merely attributed to biological or natural conditions. Sociologists have demonstrated that the spread of diseases is heavily influenced by the socioeconomic status of individuals, ethnic traditions or beliefs, and other cultural factors. Where medical research might gather statistics on a disease, a sociological perspective on an illness would provide insight on what external factors caused the demographics who contracted the disease to become ill.\n\nThis topic requires a global approach of analysis because the influence of societal factors varies throughout the world. This will be demonstrated through discussion of the major diseases of each continent. These diseases are sociologically examined and compared based on the traditional medicine, economics, religion, and culture that is specific to each region. HIV/AIDS serves as a common basis of comparison among regions. While it is extremely problematic in certain areas, in others it has affected a relatively small percentage of the population. Sociological factors can help to explain why these discrepancies exist.\n\nThere are obvious differences in patterns of health and illness across societies, over time, and within particular society types. There has historically been a long-term decline in mortality within industrialized societies, and on average, life-expectancies are considerably higher in developed, rather than developing or undeveloped, societies. Patterns of global change in health care systems make it more imperative than ever to research and comprehend the sociology of health and illness. Continuous changes in economy, therapy, technology and insurance can affect the way individual communities view and respond to the medical care available. These rapid fluctuations cause the issue of health and illness within social life to be very dynamic in definition. Advancing information is vital because as patterns evolve, the study of the sociology of health and illness constantly needs to be updated.\n\nHumans have long sought advice from those with knowledge or skill in healing. Paleopathology and other historical records, allow an examination of how ancient societies dealt with illness and outbreak. Rulers in Ancient Egypt sponsored physicians that were specialists in specific diseases. Imhotep was the first medical doctor known by name. An Egyptian who lived around 2650 B.C., he was an adviser to King Zoser at a time when Egyptians were making progress in medicine. Among his contributions to medicine was a textbook on the treatment of wounds, broken bones, and even tumors.\n\nStopping the spread of infectious disease was of utmost importance for maintaining a healthy society. The outbreak of disease during the Peloponnesian War was recorded by Thucydides who survived the epidemic. From his account it is shown how factors outside the disease itself can affect society. The Athenians were under siege and concentrated within the city. Major city centers were the hardest hit. This made the outbreak even more deadly and with probable food shortages the fate of Athens was inevitable. Approximately 25% of the population died of the disease. Thucydides stated that the epidemic \"carried away all alike\". The disease attacked people of different ages, sexes and nationalities.\nAncient medical systems stressed the importance of reducing illness through divination and ritual. Other codes of behavior and dietary protocols were widespread in the ancient world. During the Zhou Dynasty in China, doctors suggested exercise, meditation and temperance to preserve one's health. The Chinese closely link health with spiritual well-being. Health regimes in ancient India focused on oral health as the best method for a healthy life. The Talmudic code created rules for health which stressed ritual cleanliness, connected disease with certain animals and created diets. Other examples include the Mosaic Code and Roman baths and aqueducts.\n\nThose that were most concerned with health, sanitation and illness in the ancient world were those in the elite class. Good health was thought to reduce the risk of spiritual defilement and therefore enhanced the social status of the ruling class who saw themselves as the beacon of civilization. During the late Roman Period, sanitation for the lower classes was a concern for the leisured class. Those that had the means would donate to charities that focused on the health of non-elites. After the decline of the Roman Empire, physicians and concern with public health disappeared except in the largest cities. Health and public doctors remained in the Byzantine Empire. Focusing on preventing the spread of diseases such as small pox lead to a smaller mortality rate in much of the western world. Other factors that allowed the modern rise in population include: better nutrition and environmental reforms (such as getting clean water supplies).\n\nThe present day sense of health being a public concern for the state began in the Middle Ages. A few state interventions include maintaining clean towns, enforcing quarantines during epidemics and supervising sewer systems. Private corporations also played a role in public health. The funding for research and the institutions for them to work were funded by governments and private firms. Epidemics were the cause of most government interventions. The early goal of public health was reactionary whereas the modern goal is to prevent disease before it becomes a problem. Despite the overall improvement of world health, there still has not been any decrease in the health gap between the affluent and the impoverished. Today, society is more likely to blame health issues on the individual rather than society as a whole. This was the prevailing view in the late 20th century. In the 1980s the Black Report, published in the United Kingdom, went against this view and argued that the true root of the problem was material deprivation. This report proposed a comprehensive anti-poverty strategy to address these issues. Since this did not parallel the views of the Conservative government, it did not go into action immediately. The Conservative government was criticized by the Labour Party for not implementing the suggestions that the Black Report listed. This criticism gave the Black Report the exposure it needed and its arguments were considered a valid explanation for health inequality. There is also a debate over whether poverty causes ill-health or if ill-health causes poverty. Arguments by the National Health Service gave considerable emphasis to poverty and lack of access to health care. It has also been found that heredity has more of a bearing on health than social environment, but research has also proved that there is indeed a positive correlation between socioeconomic inequalities and illness.\n\nThe Sociology of Health and Illness looks at three areas: the conceptualization, the study of measurement and social distribution, and the justification of patterns in health and illness. By looking at these things researchers can look at different diseases through a sociological lens. The prevalence and response to different diseases varies by culture. By looking at bad health, researchers can see if health affects different social regulations or controls. When measuring the distribution of health and illness, it is useful to look at official statistics and community surveys. Official statistics make it possible to look at people who have been treated. It shows that they are both willing and able to use health services. It also sheds light on the infected person's view of their illness. On the other hand, community surveys look at people's rating of their health. Then looking at the relation of clinically defined illness and self reports and find that there is often a discrepancy.\n\nA great deal of the time, mortality statistics take the place of the morbidity statistics because in many developed societies where people typically die from degenerative conditions, the age in which they die sheds more light on their life-time health. This produces many limitations when looking at the pattern of sickness, but sociologists try to look at various data to analyze the distribution better. Normally, developing societies have lower life expectancies in comparison to developed countries. They have also found correlations between mortality and sex and age. Very young and old people are more susceptible to sickness and death. On average women typically live longer than men, although women are more likely to have bad health.\nDisparities in health were also found between people in different social classes and ethnicities within the same society, even though in the medical profession they put more importance in “health related behaviors” such as alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise. There is a great deal of data supporting the conclusion that these behaviors affect health more significantly than other factors. Sociologists think that it is more helpful to look at health and illness through a broad lens. Sociologists agree that alcohol consumption, smoking, diet, and exercise are important issues, but they also see the importance of analyzing the cultural factors that affect these patterns. Sociologists also look at the effects that the productive process has on health and illness. While also looking at things such as industrial pollution, environmental pollution, accidents at work, and stress-related diseases.\n\nSocial factors play a significant role in developing health and illness. Studies of epidemiology show that autonomy and control in the workplace are vital factors in the etiology of heart disease. One cause is an effort-reward imbalance. Decreasing career advancement opportunities and major imbalances in control over work have been coupled with various negative health costs. Various studies have shown that pension rights may shed light on mortality differences between retired men and women of different socioeconomic statuses. These studies show that there are outside factors that influence health and illness.\n\nHIV/AIDS is the leading epidemic that affects the social welfare of Africa. Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can cause AIDS which is an acronym for Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), a condition in humans in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening infections. Two-thirds of the worlds HIV population is located in Sub-Saharan Africa. Since the epidemic started more than 15 million Africans have died by complications with HIV/AIDS.\n\nPeople apart of religious sub-groups of Sub-Saharan Africa and those who actively and frequently participate in religious activities are more likely to be at a lower risk of contracting HIV/AIDS. On the opposite end, there are many beliefs that an infected male can be cured of the infection by having sex with a virgin. These beliefs increase the number of people with the virus and also increase the number of rapes against women.\n\nHerbal treatment is one of the primary medicines used to treat HIV in Africa. It is used more than standard treatment because it is more affordable. Herbal treatment is more affordable but is not researched and is poorly regulated . This lack of research on whether the herbal medicines work and what the medicines consist of is a major flaw in the healing cycle of HIV in Africa.\n\nEconomically, HIV has a significant negative effect. The labor force in Africa is slowly diminishing, due to HIV-related deaths and illness. In response, government income declines and so does tax revenue. The government has to spend more money than it is making, in order to care for those affected with HIV/AIDS.\n\nA major social problem in Africa in regards to HIV is the orphan epidemic. The orphan epidemic in Africa is a regional problem. In most cases, both of the parents are affected with HIV. Due to this, the children are usually raised by their grandmothers and in extreme cases they are raised by themselves. In order to care for the sick parents, the children have to take on more responsibility by working to produce an income. Not only do the children lose their parents but they also lose their childhood as well. Having to provide care for their parents, the children also miss out on an education which increases the risk of teen pregnancy and people affected with HIV. The most efficient way to diminish the orphan epidemic is prevention: preventing children from acquiring HIV from their mothers at birth, as well as educating them on the disease as they grow older. Also, educating adults about HIV and caring for the infected people adequately will lower the orphan population.\n\nThe HIV/AIDS epidemic is reducing the average life expectancy of people in Africa by twenty years. The age range with the highest death rates, due to HIV, are those between the ages of 20 and 49 years. The fact that this age range is when adults acquire most of their income they cannot afford to send their children to school, due to the high medication costs. It also removes the people who could help aid in responding to the epidemic.\n\nAsian countries have wide variations of population, wealth, technology and health care, causing attitudes towards health and illness to differ. Japan, for example, has the third highest life expectancy (82 years old), while Afghanistan has the 11th worst (44 years old). Key issues in Asian health include childbirth and maternal health, HIV and AIDS, mental health, and aging and the elderly. These problems are influenced by the sociological factors of religion or belief systems, attempts to reconcile traditional medicinal practices with modern professionalism, and the economic status of the inhabitants of Asia.\nLike the rest of the world, Asia is threatened by a possible pandemic of HIV and AIDS. Vietnam is a good example of how society is shaping Asian HIV/AIDS awareness and attitudes towards this disease. Vietnam is a country with feudal, traditional roots, which, due to invasion, wars, technology and travel is becoming increasingly globalized. Globalization has altered traditional viewpoints and values. It is also responsible for the spread of HIV and AIDS in Vietnam. Even early globalization has added to this problem – Chinese influence made Vietnam a Confucian society, in which women are of less importance than men. Men in their superiority have no need to be sexually responsible, and women, generally not well educated, are often unaware of the risk, perpetuating the spread of HIV and AIDS as well as other STIs.\n\nConfucianism has had a strong influence on the belief system in Asia for centuries, particularly in China, Japan, and Korea, and its influence can be seen in the way people chose to seek, or not seek, medical care. An important issue in Asia is societal effect on the ability of disabled individuals to adjust to a disability. Cultural beliefs shape attitudes towards physical and mental disabilities. China exemplifies this problem. According to Chinese Confucian tradition (which is also applicable in other countries where Confucianism has been spread), people should always pursue good health in their lives, with an emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention. To the Chinese, having a disability signifies that one has not led a proper lifestyle and therefore there is a lack of opportunities for disabled individuals to explore better ways to accept or adapt to their disability.\n\nIndigenous healing practices are extremely diverse throughout Asia but often follow certain patterns and are still prevalent today. Many traditional healing practices include shamanism and herbal medicines, and may have been passed down orally in small groups or even institutionalized and professionalized. In many developing countries the only health care available until a few decades ago were those based on traditional medicine and spiritual healing. Now governments must be careful to create health policies that strike a balance between modernity and tradition. Organizations, like the World Health Organization, try to create policies that respect tradition without trying to replace it with modern science, instead regulating it to ensure safety but keeping it accessible. India in particular tries to make traditional medicines safe but still available to as many people as possible, adapting tradition to match modernization while still considering the economic positions and culture of its citizens.\nMental health issues are gaining an increasing amount of attention in the Asian countries. Many of these countries have a preoccupation with modernizing and developing their economies, resulting in cultural changes. In order to reconcile modern techniques with traditional practices, social psychologists in India are in the process of “indigenizing psychology”. Indigenous psychology is that which is derived from the laws, theories, principals, and ideas of a culture and unique to each society.\n\nIn many Asian countries, childbirth is still treated by traditional means and is thought of with regional attitudes. For example, in Pakistan, decisions concerning pregnancy and antenatal care (ANC) are usually made by older women, often the pregnant woman's mother-in-law, while the mother and father to be are distanced from the process. They may or may not receive professional ANC depending on their education, class, and financial situation. Generally in Asia, childbirth is still a woman's area and male obstetricians are rare. Female midwives and healers are still the norm in most places. Western methods are overtaking the traditional in an attempt to improve maternal health and increase the number of live births.\n\nAsian countries, which are mostly developing nations, are aging rapidly even as they are attempting to build their economies. Even wealthy Asian nations, such as Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan, also have very elderly populations and thus have to try to sustain their economies and society with small younger generations while caring for their elderly citizens. The elderly have been traditionally well respected and well cared for in most Asian cultures; experts predict that younger generations in the future are less likely to be concerned and involved in the health care of their older relatives due to various factors such as women joining the workforce more, the separation of families because of urbanization or migration, and the proliferation of Western ideals such as individualism.\n\nThe health patterns found on the continent of Australia which includes the Pacific Islands, have been very much influenced by European colonization. While indigenous medicinal beliefs are not significantly prevalent in Australia, traditional ideas are still influential in the health care problems in many of the islands of the Pacific. The rapid urbanization of Australia led to epidemics of typhoid fever and the Bubonic plague. Because of this, public health was professionalized beginning in the late 1870s in an effort to control these and other diseases. Since then Australia's health system has evolved similarly to Western countries and the main cultural influence affecting health care are the political ideologies of the parties in control of the government.\n\nAustralia has had treatment facilities for 'problem drinkers' since the 1870s. In the 1960s and 1970s it was recognized that Australia had several hundred thousand alcoholics and prevention became a priority over cures, as there was a societal consensus that treatments are generally ineffective. The government began passing laws attempting to curb alcohol consumption but consistently met opposition from the wine-making regions of southern Australia. The government has also waged a war on illegal drugs, particularly heroin, which in the 1950s became widely used as a pain reliever.\n\nExperts believe that many of the health problems in the Pacific Islands can be traced back to European colonization and the subsequent globalization and modernization of island communities. (See History of the Pacific Islands.) European colonization and late independence meant modernization but also slow economic growth, which had an enormous effect on health care, particularly on nutrition in the Pacific Islands. The end of colonization meant a loss of medical resources, and the fledgling independent governments could not afford to continue the health policies put in place by the colonial governments. Nutrition was changed radically, contributing to various other health problems. While more prosperous, urban areas could afford food, they chose poor diets, causing 'overnourishment', and leading to extremely high levels of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Poorer rural communities, on the other hand, continue to suffer from malnutrition and malaria.\n\nTraditional diets in the Pacific are very low in fat, but since World War II there has been a significant increase in fat and protein in Pacific diets. Native attitudes towards weight contribute to the obesity problem. Tongan natives see obesity as a positive thing, especially in men. They also believe that women should do as little physical work as possible while the men provide for them, meaning they get very little exercise.\n\nThe largest endeavors to improve health across Europe is the World Health Organization European Region. The goal is to improve the health of poor and disadvantaged populations by promoting healthy lifestyles including environmental, economic, social and providing health care. Overall health in Europe is very high compared to the rest of the world. The average life expectancy is around 78 in EU countries but there is a wide gap between Western and Eastern Europe. It is as low as 67 in Russia and 73 in the Balkan states. Europe is seeing an increase in the spread of HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe because of a worsening socioeconomic situation. Cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes mellitus are more prevalent is Eastern Europe. The WHO claims that poverty is the most important factor bringing on ill health across Europe. Those at low socioeconomic status levels and many young people are also at risk because of their increased tobacco, alcohol and drug abuse. Health and illness prevention in Europe is largely funded by the governmental services including: regulating health care, insurance and social programs. The role of religion and traditional medicine, however, is often left unexamined in such reports.\n\nThe study of hypertension within the United Kingdom has turned to examining the role that beliefs play in its diagnosis and treatment. Hypertension is an essential topic for study since it is linked to increased risk of stroke and coronary heart disease. The most common treatment for hypertension is medication but compliance for this treatment plan is low. A study conducted in the UK examined the differences between 'white' patients and first generation immigrants from the West Indies. There were differing reasons for non-compliance that involve the patients' perception and beliefs about the diagnosis. Patients commonly believe that high levels of anxiety when first diagnosed are the major cause and think that when stress levels decline so too will their hypertension. Other respondents in this UK based study had varying beliefs concerning the necessity of medication while others still argued that it was the side effects of medication that made them end their prescribed regimen. West Indian respondents whose lay culture teaches them to reject long-term drug therapy opted instead for folk remedies in higher numbers than the 'white' respondents. What can be seen here is that some people will choose to ignore a doctor's expert advice and will employ 'lay consultation' instead.\nBefore people seek medical help they try to interpret the symptoms themselves and often consult people in their lives or use 'self-help' measures. A study of 'everyday illness' in Finland including: influenza, infections and musculo-skeletal problems focused on reasons for consulting medical experts and explanations of illness. These common illness were examined not because of their seriousness but because of their frequency. The researchers explain five possible triggers that people seek medical aid: 1- the occurrence of an interpersonal crisis 2- perceived interference with social and personal relations 3- perceived interference with vocational & physical activity 4- sanctioning by other people 5- sufferers ideas about how long certain complaints should last. These kind of explanatory models are part of the process that people use to construct medical culture. They give meaning to illness and health, answer questions about personal responsibility about health and most importantly are part of the dialogue between patients' and professionals' illness explanations. It can help explore why some patients will follow a doctors instructions to the letter and others ignore them completely. A patient's explanation or understanding of their illness can be much broader than a physician's and this dynamic has become a major criticism of modern medical practice since it normally excludes the \"social, psychological and experiential dimensions of illness.\"\n\nThe Finnish study examined 127 patients and the results have been different from findings in other countries where there is more 'lay consultation'. Half of the respondents did not have any lay consultation before coming to the doctors office. One-third did not try any self-treatment and three-quarters of the sample consulted the doctor within three days of symptoms developing. Possible explanations are that in Finland there is an aspect \"over-protectiveness\" within their health care system. Many might conclude that the Finnish people are dependent and helpless but the researchers of this study found that people chose to consult professionals because they trusted them over some lay explanation. These results echo similar studies in Ireland that explain this phenomenon as being based in a strong work ethic. Illness in these countries will affect their work and Finnish people will quickly get treatment so they can return to work. This research out of Finland also describes that this relationship between patient and doctor is based on:\n\nThe conflict between medical and lay worlds is prominent. On one hand many patients believe they are the expert of their own body and view the Doctor-patient relationship as authoritarian. These people will often use knowledge outside the medical field to deal with health and illness. Others see the doctor as the expert and are shy about describing their symptoms and therefore rely on the doctor for diagnosis and treatment.\n\nNorth America is a fairly recent settled continent, made up of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. It was built by an amalgamation of wealth, ideas, culture, and practices. North America is highly advanced intellectually, technologically, and traditionally. This advantageous character of North American nations has caused a high average life expectancy of 75 years for males and 80 years for females. This leads to the conclusion that North America has cultivated a comparatively healthy society. As North America contains several core nations, the growing economies in those nations are able to maintain and develop medical institutions. This subsequently provides more access to health care for American citizens but health care is not universal. North America is known for being a leading nation in regards to industrialization and modernization, but the United States lacks federal laws regarding health care as a basic human right. This lag of health care security causes subsequent issues with pharmaceutical competition, lack of care for the elderly, and little attention to alternative medicine. Health care and education are plentiful at a price and illness still persists for many reasons. A main reason is that a lower- and middle-class population still exists in plentiful numbers, maintaining a group that is highly vulnerable to physical ailment.\nNorth America's primary risk factors for illness are currently alcohol abuse, malnutrition, obesity, tobacco use, and water sanitation. Obesity is a recent epidemic in North America. The 1990s brought a rise in the average Body Mass Index, or BMI. From the beginning and to the end of the decade, the median percent of adults who were obese rose from 12% to 20%. Alcoholism is the addiction of over-consumption of alcohol and is highly prevalent in the US. There are high incidence rates in many other world regions. Roughly 61% of American adults drank in 2007, and 21% of current drinkers consumed five or more drinks at one point in the last year. There have also been 22,073 alcohol induced deaths in the United States in the past year, about 13,000 of which were related to liver disease. Alcoholism has many risk factors ingrained in North American culture, such as heredity, stress from competition or availability.\n\nThe Swine Flu (also known as (H1N1) epidemic is a recent disease emerging in the early 21st century. In April 2009, during the early days of the outbreak, a molecular biologist named Dr. Henry Miller wrote in the \"Wall Street Journal\" about New York City high-school students. These students apparently brought the virus back from Mexico and infected their classmates. All six cases so far reported in Canada were connected directly or indirectly with travel to Mexico as well. Flu viruses can be directly transmitted (via droplets from sneezing or coughing) from pigs to people, and vice versa. These cross-species infections occur most commonly when people are close to large numbers of pigs, such as in barns, livestock exhibits at fairs, and slaughterhouses. The flu is transmissible from human to human, either directly or via contaminated surfaces.\"\n\nThere are many diseases that affect South America, but two major conditions are malaria and Hepatitis D.\nMalaria affects every country in South America except Uruguay, Chile, and The Falkland Islands. Elevation is a major factor in the areas where malaria is found. The disease is spread from person to person via mosquito bites. People are typically bitten by mosquitoes at dusk and dawn. Symptoms of this disorder are: high fever, chills, sweating, headaches, body aches, weakness, vomiting and diarrhea. If left untreated, new symptoms can occur; people that are infected may experience seizures, delirium and coma. Severe cases may end in death. Malaria can be cured, but the symptoms may not become noticeable until months later. There are three forms of medication that can cure Malaria. An infected person's accessibility to these drugs is dependent upon their access to medical care and their financial situation. Literature about Malaria treatment typically is focused toward people who are tourists. Most sources are not written with the native in mind.\nThe first sign of Hepatitis D was detected in 1978 when a strange and unrecognizable internuclear antigen was discovered during a liver biopsy of several Italians who suffered HBV infection. Scientists initially thought that it was an antigenic specificity of HBV, but they soon found that it was a protein from another disease altogether. They called it \"Hepatitis Delta Virus\" (HDV). This new virus was found to be defective. HDV needed HBV to act as a helper function in order for it to be detected. Normally Hepatitis B is transmitted through blood or any type of blood product. In South America Hepatitis D was found to be fatal. Scientists are still unsure in what way this disease was being transmitted throughout certain South American countries. Sexual contact and drug use are the most common means of transmission. HDV is still considered an unusual form of hepatitis. Agents of this virus resemble that of plant viroids. It is still hard to tell how many stereotypes exist because HDV is under the umbrella of HBV. HDV causes very high titers in the blood of people who are infected. Incubation of Hepatitis D typically lasts for thirty five days. Most often Hepatitis D is a co-infection with Hepatitis B or a super-infection with chronic hepatitis. In terms of super infections there are high mortality rates, ranging seventy to eighty percent; in contrast with co-infections which have a one to three percent mortality rate. There is little information with the ecology of Hepatitis D. Epidemics have been found in Venezuela, Peru, Columbia, and Brazil. People who are treated for Hepatitis B have been able to control Hepatitis D. People who have chronic HDB will continue to get HDV.\n\nAnother disease that affects South America is HIV and AIDS. In 2008 roughly two million people had HIV and AIDS. By the end of 2008 one hundred and seventy thousand people were infected with AIDS and HIV. Seventy seven thousand people died from this disease by the end of that year. Brazil has the most people that are affected with AIDS and HIV in South America. Forty-three percent of people in Brazil have HIV. In Brazil sixty percent of the inhabitants use drugs, are HIV positive, and are HIV positive because of their drug use. Usually this disease is transmitted by either drug use involving needles or unprotected sex. Sharing needles and being infected with HIV and AIDS is most common in Paraguay and Uruguay. South America is trying to get treatment to the thousands of people infected by this disease. Brazil is offering generic AIDS prescriptions that are much less expensive than the name brand drugs. One hundred and eighty-one thousand inhabitants in Brazil who were infected are being treated. That accounts for eighty percent of those who needed immediate help. This aid from the government has had positive results. Statistics show that there was a fifty percent decrease in mortality rates, approximately sixty to eighty percent decrease in morbidity rates and a seventy percent decrease in hospitalization of infected people.\n\nIn very remote areas of South America, traditional healers are the only forms of health care people have.\nIn north Aymara and south Mapuche, where the indigenous groups have the strongest voices, they still heavily use traditional medicine. The government in Chile has implemented an Indigenous Health System to help strengthen the health care system. Even with Chile's indigenous groups, Chile still has the best public health services in South America. They also have the lowest mortality rates in the area. Their health care policies are centered around family and community wellbeing by focusing on the strategies for prevention health strategies. Reports have shown an increase in mental health issues, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.\n\nSouth America's economy is developing rapidly and has a great deal of industries. The major industry in South America are agriculture. Other industries are fishing, handicrafts, and natural resources. Its trade and import-export market is continually thriving. In the past South American countries moved slowly in regards to economic development. South America began to build its economy ever since World War II. South America's largest economies are Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Columbia. Venezuela, Peru, and Argentina's economy are growing very rapidly.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12242015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12242015", "title": "Taxi dance hall", "text": "Taxi dance hall\n\nA taxi dance hall is a type of dance hall where dancers, usually young women, called taxi dancers are paid to dance with usually male patrons. The owners of a taxi dance hall provide music and a dance floor for their patrons and taxi dancers. In the United States during the 1920s and 1930s, when taxi dancing was at its peak, patrons of taxi dance halls would typically buy dance tickets for ten cents each. When they presented a ticket to a taxi dancer, she would dance with them for the length of a single song. Taxi dancers earned a commission on every dance ticket that they collected. The \"ticket-a-dance\" system was the centerpiece of the taxi dance halls. Taxi dance halls are vividly represented on the ouverture of Henry Miller novel Sexus, where the narrator falls in love with a taxi dancer after meeting her on a Thursday night, circa 1928.\n\nThe taxi dance hall is a uniquely American institution that was first introduced in 1913 within San Francisco's Barbary Coast neighborhood. At that time reform movements were shutting down many bordellos and red-light districts within America's cities, and strength for Prohibition was gaining. In 1920, when the taxi dance halls entered their steep upward climb to popularity, prohibition was enacted and made serving alcohol in saloons, bars, and cafes illegal. The taxi dance hall's roots can be traced to a number of earlier dance establishments.\n\nPrior to the emergence of taxi dance halls in San Francisco, California, that city popularized a different form of dance hall called the \"Barbary Coast dance hall\", or also called the \"Forty-Nine['49] dance hall\". Forty-Niner is a term for the gold prospectors who came to California during the California Gold Rush circa 1849. At the Barbary Coast dance halls, female employees danced with male patrons and earned their living on commissions paid for the drinks that they could encourage their male dance partners to buy. These dance halls were representative of the Old West—noisy, rough, boisterous, and occasionally violent. As writer Will Irwin described: \n\nBut in 1913, San Francisco enacted new laws that would forbid dancing in any cafe or saloon where alcohol was served. The closure of the Barbary Coast dance halls quickly fostered a new kind of pay-to-dance scheme called the \"closed dance hall\". The name was derived from the fact that female patrons were not allowed—the only women permitted in these halls were the dancing female employees. A report from Public Dance Hall Committee of San Francisco Civic League of Voters states: \nInside a closed dance hall, a dancer would earn her income by the number of tickets she could collect in exchange for dances. The management would typically pay the girls half the price of a dance ticket. With the closed dance hall, the centerpiece of the taxi dance hall—the \"ticket-a-dance\" system—was introduced. Community groups began to oppose the closed dance halls, and in response to this growing political threat, these early taxi dance halls began to disguise themselves as dance schools. In 1921 the police commission ruled against employment of women as taxi dancers, and San Francisco's taxi dance halls were permanently shut down.\n\nAround the time that San Francisco's taxi dance halls were being shut down, the taxi dance hall was being reinvented in differing formats elsewhere in America. Dance academies, which were struggling to survive, began to consider the ticket-a-dance system. Previous to the ticket-a-dance system, dance schools would use the \"line up plan\" to provide dance partners for their students. Female dance instructors would get in a line, and students would then dance with the next instructor in line. Students were not allowed to choose a female dance instructor for their practice dances.\n\nThe first instance of the ticket-a-dance system in Chicago came from a description, given by Godfrey Johnson of Mader-Johnson Dance Studios: \nOther dance schools began to try the ticket-a-dance system as well. As a former proprietor of the Colonial Dancing Academy in Chicago states: \nMany dance academy proprietors, who were disturbed by the \"hoodlum element\" that the ticket-a-dance system attracted, were very reluctant to adopt the dance tickets. But a Greek immigrant, Nicholas Philocrates, perceived the power of this opportunity, and fully embraced the ticket-a-dance plan that he had seen on the West Coast in 1920. Mr. Philocrates said: \n\nThough Philocrates describes his dance hall as a \"school\", he would soon be followed by other Greek immigrants who would open other taxi dance halls in Chicago that did not provide any instruction whatsoever. Some historians consider Philocrates to be the father of the taxi dance hall.\n\nAlso at that time, many large cities like Chicago had large public ballrooms. The public ballrooms were struggling to survive, as they had difficulty attracting as many female patrons as male patrons. Partially due to the large immigrant populations of that time, many of the neighborhoods where taxi dance halls would compete with public ballrooms had five times as many men as women. While the public ballrooms had few women and many might refuse to dance, the taxi dance halls had many eager female dance partners who would agree to \"dance with all-comers\" that held dance tickets. The new competition of the increasingly popular taxi-dance halls would cause many ballrooms to either adopt the ticket-a-dance system or go out of business.\n\nTaxi dance halls flourished in America during the 1920s and 1930s. In 1931 there were over 100 taxi dance halls in New York City, and between 35,000 and 50,000 men would go to these halls every week. There were also establishments which offered male professional dancers to women such as Maxim's in New York, where dancer/actor Rudolph Valentino got an early start.\n\nBy 1925, the taxi dance halls were coming under attack by reform movements that insisted on licensing, police supervision, and succeeded in closing down some taxi dance halls for lewd behavior. After World War II the popularity of taxi dance halls began to diminish. In the 1930s, 50 cities had taxi dance halls, but by 1954 that number dropped to just 6 cities. Only ten taxi-dance halls remained in New York City by 1952. Most of the taxi-dance halls disappeared by the 1960s. Many historians say that the return of the saloon and the cocktail lounge of post-Prohibition America contributed to the demise of the taxi dance hall.\n\nToday some cities still have clubs where female employees can be hired to dance with patrons. These clubs no longer use the \"ticket-a-dance\" system, but have time-clocks and punch-cards that allow the patron to pay for the dancer's time by the minute. The clock used by the cashier to determine the cost of time spent with a hostess is often set a few minutes later than the clock used to print the checkout time on the ticket, thus fraudulently increasing revenues for the establishment and hostess alike. Particularly accommodating hostesses often expect tips equivalent to the amount charged for their time. Some of these modern dance clubs exist in the same buildings where taxi dancing was done in the early 20th century. The \"Dreamland\" club of Los Angeles was such an establishment. In the 1930s it was called Roseland Roof, and was owned by the Fenton brothers. When the Fenton brothers sold the club in 1981, the new buyers renamed the club to Dreamland, and continued taxi dancing in its original ballroom. These latter day establishments, including Starlight and Fantasy, are called \"Hostess Clubs\".\n\nPaul G. Cressey's book, entitled \"The Taxi-Dance Hall: A Sociological Study in Commercialized Recreation and City Life\", gives a history of taxi dance halls, with interviews with taxi dancers and patrons. Cressey describes the phenomena as in terms of the human needs of American city dwellers in the early 20th century. He listed nine categories to describe the types of patrons:\n\n\nCressey goes on to describes the male patrons of taxi dance halls as being a varied and occasionally motley crew: \nIn general, patrons were rarely businessmen or professional people, but were typically skilled or semi-skilled workers from the lower middle class. Frequently the patrons experienced social obstacles that prevented them from seeking feminine company through more traditional means. For the socially ostracized, the taxi dance hall became oasis where they could temporarily experience a sense of equality, recognition, and sometimes a fantasy of romance.\n\nFor others of a more individualized nature, the taxi dance hall became an interesting diversion that allowed dancing and feminine company without the restrictions of more traditional customs. Cressey interviews a patron [case #42] who describes:\n\nDuring the 1920s the ages of taxi dancers ranged from 15 to 28 years, and two-thirds of taxi dancers came from homes in which the financial support of a father had been removed. They were occasionally runaways from their families, and it was not unusual for taxi dancers to be from homes where the parents had separated. And despite their young age, two-fifths of taxi dancers had been previously married, but were no longer.\n\nMany times the dancers were immigrants from European countries such as Poland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, and France. Various cultural conflicts would arise between parents and their dancing offspring, especially if the parents were from rural areas. For dancers of an immigrant family, the dancer was often the financial support of the family. When a girl supplanted the parent or parents as breadwinner, sometimes the dancer would assume an aggressive role in the family by \"subordinating the parental standards to her own requirements and demands\".\n\nThese conflicts in values between dancers and their parents frequently caused the dancers to lead so-called \"double lives\", denying that they worked at a taxi-dance hall. To further this divide, the girls would sometimes adopt aliases so that their activities might not reach their families' ears. When parents found out, there were three typical outcomes—the girl gave up her dancing career, the girl left home and became estranged from the family, or the family accepted the girl's conduct, however reluctantly, due to financial necessity.\n\nDespite the frequent hardships, many of the dancers seemed to enjoy the lifestyle as they adopted a pursuit of what Cressey calls \"money, excitement, and affection\". Within his book, Cressey gives scores of quotes from taxi dancers who speak very favorably about their experiences at a taxi-dance hall.\n\nOne dancer [case #15] from the 1920s describes her start at a taxi-dance hall.\nAnd yet another dancer from Chicago [case #11] spoke very positively of her experiences:\n\nThe special vocabulary of the dancers is not only a form of communication, but also helps describe the dancers as it reflects their judgments, activities, and interests. Here are some example that Cressey lists in his book.\n\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, the United States would for the first time have more inhabitants living within its cities than in rural and small-town areas. Cities were experiencing extreme growth; indeed, Chicago's population doubled between 1900 and 1930. Many young men and women were leaving their rural and small-town neighborhoods for the same promise of adventure that the Old West had previously provided. At this time, America was experiencing a flood of male-dominated immigration.\n\nEntertainment in America's cities was becoming a big business. New forms of mass entertainment were the baseball stadium, the football stadium, the amusement park, and the motion picture theater. Cressey and other sociologists like Ernest W. Burgess came to see taxi dance halls, and these other new forms of mass entertainment, as \"commercializing the \"human interest in stimulation\"\".\n\nFor this uprooted culture, cities provided a type of \"anonymity\" that was not found in their previous rural and family-oriented neighborhoods. Once inside a city, young men and women were free to do as they pleased without moral criticism from their families or neighbors. Cressey felt that cities became \"inhabited by rootless, detached people who connect with each other primarily on the basis of mutual exploitation\". The taxi dance hall was just such a place where very different people from very different backgrounds—patrons and dancers—would meet for temporary and unlikely alliances. Frequently inside the taxi dance hall, the human needs of unassimilated males would meet the economic needs of taxi dancers.\n\nNear the time when Cressey finished his book in 1932, he noticed reform movements were attempting to shut down the taxi dance halls. Cressey was disturbed by the fact that if taxi dance halls were eliminated without appropriate substitutes, the human needs that fueled the phenomenon would go unanswered and possibly find self-destructive forms of expression. For Cressey, the taxi dance hall became a symptom of the isolation, loneliness, and alienation that plagues many cities.\n\nTaxi dancing is often viewed as the parent phenomenon of lap dancing, and indeed there are many similarities. Like the taxi dancer, the lap dancer provides her service only for the length of a single song. It also received complaints from the community—bringing up the same controversies concerning morality, touching, and government regulation. However, decades after the taxi dance halls of the 1920s had been maligned by reformists, a California State judge in 1999 overruled a law prohibiting taxi dancing while stating that \"taxi dancing is an established tradition in America that has gone on since the 1920s\".\n\nThe \"fantasy of romance\" also plays a role in both taxi dancing and lap dancing. Edward Fenton, a former owner of a large taxi dance hall, Roseland Roof, was interviewed in 1999 about the taxi dancing scene during the 1930s. When asked about the taxi dancers' patrons, Fenton replied: \"The customer was lonely, that's the word. The club brought in lonesome people. They came here to meet with girls and carry on a secret romance\". But when asked if he was implying that the customers had sexual affairs with the taxi dancers, Fenton replied: \"No. I didn't say that... the customer lived in a \"fantasy\".\" Similarly, today's patrons of lap dancing sometimes discuss their experiences within Internet forums, and even a quick read of these forums reveals that they also sometimes have feelings of romance for dancers whom they refer to as an ATF, an acronym for \"All Time Favorite\".\nDuring a 2002 interview for San Francisco Magazine, a lap dancer for the Mitchell Brothers strip club described the mindset of some patrons: \nSociologist Paul Cressey may have prophesied the invention of lap dancing some 80 years ago when he suggested that if taxi dancing were to be eliminated, the human needs that fueled the phenomenon would go unanswered and find more extreme forms of expression.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "143196", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143196", "title": "The Beatles Anthology", "text": "The Beatles Anthology\n\nThe Beatles Anthology is a television documentary, a three-volume set of double albums, and a book focusing on the history of the Beatles. Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all participated in the making and approval of the works, which are sometimes referred to collectively as the \"Anthology\" project, while John Lennon had archival interviews.\n\nThe documentary series was first broadcast in November 1995, with expanded versions released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1996 and on DVD in 2003. The documentary used interviews with the Beatles and their associates to narrate the history of the band as seen through archival footage and performances. The \"Anthology\" book, released in 2000, paralleled the documentary in presenting the group's history through quotes from interviews.\n\nThe initial volume of the album set (\"Anthology 1\") was released the same week of the documentary's airdate, with the subsequent two volumes (\"Anthology 2\" and \"Anthology 3\") released in 1996. They included unreleased performances and outtakes presented in roughly chronological order, along with two new songs based on demo tapes recorded by Lennon after the group broke up: \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", both produced by Jeff Lynne.\n\nApproximately coinciding with the release of the \"Free as a Bird\" single and \"Anthology 1\" album (the first of three double-CD albums), \"The Beatles Anthology\" series of documentaries was broadcast on ITV in the United Kingdom and ABC television in the United States in 1995. The \"Anthology\" series takes a form similar to that of the \"Anthology\" book, by being a series of first-person accounts by the Beatles themselves, with no external \"objective\" narration. Footage in the \"Anthology\" series features voice-over recordings of all four Beatles to push the narrative of the story, with contributions from their producer, road manager and others. As well as telling their story through archival footage, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr appear in interview segments recorded exclusively for the series; John Lennon appears only in historic archival footage. The Beatles' wives, past and present, do not appear (excluding archival footage such as video from India and the music video for Harrison's song \"Something\").\n\nThe series, which was made over five thousand hours of planning and production, is composed of numerous film clips and interviews that present a complete history of the band from the Beatles' own personal perspectives. When it aired on ABC, the series comprised six hour-long programs, aired on three nights in November 1995. The series was later released, as eight expanded episodes, on VHS, laserdisc and as a boxed set of five DVDs (4 discs with 2 episodes apiece and a disc of extras).\n\nAir dates on ABC:\n\n\nPart 1 of the series drew 17 million households, meaning an average of 27.3 million viewers, which was much better than usual for ABC at the time, but behind most broadcasts of \"Friends\" on NBC, which in its second season was averaging 29.4 million viewers per episode.\n\nIn promoting the series during this time, ABC identified itself as \"A-Beatles-C\" – an homage to the mid-1960s Cousin Felica-era \"77 W-A-Beatles-C\" call sign of the network's flagship NYC AM radio station – and several of the network's prime-time sitcoms replaced their regular opening credit themes with Beatles tracks.\n\nTo accompany the \"Anthology\" series, three albums were issued, each containing two CDs or three vinyl LPs of mostly never-before-released Beatles material (the exceptions being the Tony Sheridan-era material), although many of the tracks had appeared on bootlegs for many years prior.\n\nTwo days after the first television special in the series had aired, \"Anthology 1\" was released to stores, and included music recorded by the Quarrymen, the famous Decca Records audition tapes, and various out-takes and demos from the band's first four albums. It also included the song \"Lend Me Your Comb\", omitted from the collection \"Live at the BBC\", released the previous year (1994). The song \"Free as a Bird\" was included at the very start. 450,000 copies of \"Anthology 1\" were sold in its first day of release, the most sales for an album in a single day ever. The band's first drummer Pete Best, replaced by Ringo Starr in 1962 before the Beatles recorded professionally for EMI, received his first substantial Beatles royalties from this album, for the inclusion of early demo tracks on which he played.\n\n\"Anthology 2\" was released on 17 March 1996. The second collection presented out-takes and demos from the Beatles' sessions for \"Help!\", \"Rubber Soul\", \"Revolver\", \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour\". These included selected early demos and takes for Lennon's \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", previously available only to bootleg collectors. The new song \"Real Love\" – which, like \"Free as a Bird\", was based on an unfinished Lennon recording – was also included in the two-CD collection.\n\n\"Anthology 3\" was released on 28 October 1996. The third collection featured out-takes and demos from \"The Beatles\" (\"White Album\"), \"Abbey Road\" and \"Let It Be\", as well as several songs from Harrison and McCartney which later became post-Beatle tracks.\n\nThe three album covers, when laid side-by-side, become one long painted collage of various peeling posters and album covers representing the different stages of the Beatles' career. This was the work of Klaus Voormann, who also created the album cover for \"Revolver\" in 1966. The \"Anthology\" covers required Voormann to recreate elements of his cover for \"Revolver\" within the collage. During the music video for \"Free as a Bird\", the \"Anthology\" collage appears as posters on a shop window as the camera pans quickly across the street. The design also adorned the VHS, laserdisc and DVD releases, again to be properly encountered by laying the cases side-by-side. Upon the release of \"Anthology 3\", HMV stores made available a limited edition cardboard sleeve designed to hold all three CD volumes of which each side of the sleeve make up half of the collage.\n\nAll three albums were made digitally available on the iTunes Store on 14 June 2011, alongside a new \"Anthology Highlights\" album which featured a selection of tracks from all three albums and reached number 184 on \"Billboard\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s United States Top Current Albums chart.\n\n\nIn October 2000, \"The Beatles Anthology\" book was released, which included interviews with all four band members and others involved, plus rare photos. Many of the interviews quoted are from those featured in the documentary films. The book is designed as a large-format hardback, with imaginative artwork throughout, and several visually impressive and colourful spreads featuring graphics relevant to the proceeding chronology, photographic arrays and a variety of text styles and layouts. The book went straight to the top of the \"New York Times\" bestsellers list. In 2002, the book was released as a large-format paperback.\n\nDuring early 1995 as work on \"The Beatles Anthology\" continued, Yoko Ono and McCartney recorded an avant-garde piece called \"Hiroshima Sky Is Always Blue\". Ono provided vocals and McCartney played bass, while Sean Lennon, Linda McCartney, and McCartney's children played various instruments. The piece was broadcast on Japanese public television in memory of the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.\n\nThe track \"Carnival of Light\" recorded during the \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" sessions was intended to be released on the \"Anthology 2\" album, but was vetoed by George Harrison.\n\nIt was reported that McCartney, Harrison and Starr worked on a new composition called \"All for Love\" in March 1995, intended as a track on \"Anthology 3\", but the effort was abandoned. No version of the song has reached the public.\n\nEach of the three \"Anthology\" albums was accompanied by a promotional CD sampler sent to radio stations shortly before the official release dates. These CDs have since become highly sought collector's items. Even rarer is a vinyl version of the sampler for \"Anthology 2\", which was only sent to college radio stations and featured a different cover (though the contents were the same).\n\nIn October 1996 there was a strictly limited release from EMI, a slip case cover to house all three CD volumes, which have since become extremely rare, fetching high prices among collectors.\n\nThe success of the \"Anthology\" albums was parodied by the release of the Rutles' \"Archaeology\" some months later. Delays in the release of the third volume of the Beatles' series ultimately meant that the Rutles' parody arrived in shops on the same day as its inspiration.\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic parodied \"The Beatles Anthology\" in an \"Al TV\" special. He said he had a copy of a fictional \"Anthology 17\", which he claimed would not be available to the public for a while. He played for the audience a track of Paul McCartney brushing his teeth and Ringo Starr shaving before \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\n\n\"The Beatles Anthology\" was also parodied on the short-lived \"Dana Carvey Show\", which was being aired on ABC around the same time that \"Anthology\" was being televised on the network.\n"}

It was included in the 8th volume of the author's \"Collected Writings.\" In 1888, for this work, the author was awarded Subba Row medal.\n\nAn American author Gary Lachman, noting Blavatsky's \"animus toward the Judeo-Christian ethos,\" has cited her article in which she writes that \"Christianity is now the religion of arrogance \"par excellence,\" a stepping-stone for ambition, a sinecure for wealth, sham and power; a convenient screen for hypocrisy.\" A Russian Indologist Alexander Senkevich has noted that she did not make secrets out of her \"skeptical attitude towards the Gospels,\" considering them unrelated to either Jesus or his Apostles. Joseph Tyson wrote in his book that, according to Blavatsky, for example, in the Protestant camp there are 350 dissenting sects, and she commented that if \"one of these may have the approximate truth, still 349 must be necessarily false.\" A Russian philosopher Lydia Fesenkova wrote that, in Blavatsky's opinion, the Christian sacred books are \"magazines of falsehoods,\" and all of them have served \n\nProfessor Robert Ellwood wrote that Blavatsky was a ruthless critic of the church tradition of Christianity, whether in relation to \"the Church Fathers or modern priests, pastors and missionaries.\" The reason for her hostility to church Christianity \"was what she perceived as arrogance combined with misplaced concreteness.\" She believed that \"churchmen, past and present, whether through intentional deceit or mere stupidity, had concealed the real origin and meaning of Christianity as a vehicle of the ancient wisdom.\"\n\nA Russian orthodox theologian, Dimitry Drujinin wrote that in her article Blavatsky calls Lüd as the \"hometown\" of Jesus. This indicates that she supported the statements of Talmud that Jesus was the son of a man named Pandira and \"lived a hundred years before the beginning of the Gospel events.\" In his youth, he lived for many years in Egypt, where he \"was initiated\" in esoteric wisdom. After returning to Palestine, he reorganized the movement of the Essenes, who worshipped him as a teacher. Slandered by his enemies, he was killed in his hometown. Drujinin quotes the article with \"He was stoned and then crucified on a tree, on the eve of Passover.\"\n\nDrujinin wrote that, according to Blavatsky, it is necessary to distinguish between Chrêstos and Christos (Christ). The first name, in hers opinion, means neophyte who approaching to Initiation, and the second one she defines in this way: \"Christ— the true esoteric Saviour—is no man, but the Divine Principle in every human being.\" Drujinin added that she believes that Christians have lost the understanding of the true meaning of the word Christos: \"The very meaning of the terms Chrêstos and Christos, and the bearing of both on 'Jesus of Nazareth,' a name coined out of Joshua the Nazar, has now become a dead letter for all with the exception of non-Christian Occultists.\" He wrote that Christians, according to Blavatsky, only afterwards unfairly put aside \"all the other Chrêstoi, who have appeared to them as rivals of their Man-God.\" The Russian \"Encyclopedia of Sages, Mystics, and Magicians\" wrote that in her article Blavatsky \"allegorically\" proclaims: \"Christos was 'the Way,' while Chrêstos was the lonely traveller journeying on to reach the ultimate goal through that 'Path,' which goal was Christos, the glorified Spirit of 'Truth.'\" In a like manner Drujinin has quoted hers article: \n\"To the true follower of the Spirit of Truth, it matters little, therefore, whether Jesus, as man and Chrêstos, lived during the era called Christian, or before, or never lived at all. The Adepts, who lived and died for humanity, have existed in many and all the ages.\"\n\nTyson wrote that \"sanctification,\" in Blavatsky's opinion, \"was ever the synonym (for) the 'Mahatmic-condition,' i.e., the union of the man with the divine principle (Augoeides) in him.\" In this connection, he has said that Neoplatonic friars \"practiced fasting, celibacy, contemplative prayer, and charity in order to,\" as Blavatsky writes, \"kill one's personality and its passions, to blot out... separateness from one's 'Father,' the Divine Spirit in man.\"\n\nWhile studying the Theosophical doctrine, Drujinin has stated that Blavatsky considers the \"story of Jesus Christ,\" which was told in the Gospels, as a fantasy. In support of this he has quoted hers article:\n\"Whence, then, the Gospels, the life of Jesus of Nazareth? Has it not been repeatedly stated that no human, mortal brain could have invented the life of the Jewish Reformer, followed by the awful drama on Calvary? We say on the authority of the esoteric Eastern School, that all this came from the Gnostics, as far as the name Christos and the astronomico-mystical allegories are concerned, and from the writings of the ancient Tanaïm as regards the Kabalistic connection of Jesus or Joshua, with the Biblical personifications.\"\n\nAccording to French philosopher Édouard Schuré, Christian esotericism in the Gospels is revealed if to approach them from the standpoint of the \"Essenian and Gnostic traditions.\" A religious studies scholar Alvin Kuhn stated that the \"Gospels\" in ancient times were not \"the biographies of one, or of any, living earthly person, but were held as the literary forms of a universal dramatical representation of the experience of our divine souls in the mortal body here on earth.\"\n\nThis article by Blavatsky always aroused rejection on the part of those who professed the teachings of Jesus only literally. Thus, a priest Drujinin (Russian Orthodox Church) claimed that the Theosophists \"had reduced\" Jesus Christ to the level of one of the Adepts and even generally questioned his existence. And moreover:\n\"The founders of Theosophy deny the importance of Christ's crucifixion. Recognizing within the framework of the concepts karma and reincarnation the possibility of paying by sufferings only for their own sins, they actually represent the sufferings of the Lord Jesus Christ only as a tragicomic mistake.\"\nOn the other hand, Alvin Kuhn, being a supporter of Christ myth theory, stated that esotericism \"hung up midway\" between recognizing the Gospels as documents of early Christian history or treating them as an allegory. He wrote that Blavatsky contributed to this \"anomalous\" situation: arguing in one place that \"Christ— the true esoteric Saviour—is no man, but the Divine Principle in every human being,\" she in another place supports a thesis about the real existence of the Jewish Adept Jesus. Kuhn proclaimed: \"The matter of the existence or non-existence of a certain man in human history is not dual in nature. Either Jesus, the Gospel Figure, was a person in human body, or he was not.\"\n\nAccording to Ellwood, many of Blavatsky's \"onslaughts\" against Christianity, including her attacks on organizations that devoted themselves to \"good works such as the Salvation Army, were not always even-handed.\" Moreover, she apparently didn't know about the nascent liberal branch of Christian theology — \"Schleiermacher, Coleridge, Channing, Kingsley and many others\" who had nothing to do to the primitive \"dogmatism she so hated.\" Nevertheless, her attacks on church Christianity can be seen as necessary to fulfill the task of the Theosophical Society connected with the formation of a \"new spirituality based on an immanent universalism\" which opposing aggressive religiosity \"she saw all around, whether in European bishops or in missionaries abroad.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The book is about the philosophical differences between countries in the European Union, particularly Germany and France, and how their contrasting outlooks on political philosophy have shaped the Eurozone. The book also provides context to how the ideas that led to the creation of the European Union have influenced and been influenced by ideas in the United States, the United Kingdom, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European Central Bank (ECB).\n\nThe book begins with the historical roots of German-French differences, highlighting the cultural and philosophical aspects which distinguish the two nations. Their divergent systems of philosophical thoughts have spurred differences in economic ideologies in regards to federalism versus centralism, monetary and fiscal policies, and austerity versus stimulus. The authors argue that \"there is no single, coherent economic philosophy within Europe. Rather, different nations have retained their own distinct economic philosophers and view European-level institutions--and ways to improve them--in this light.\" The books continus with an analysis on how these philosophies have manifested themselves in the European Union, mainly through the Maastricht negotiations and the commitment to a currency union. They expound upon the divergent ideas of economics and politics have contributed to different models of governance within Europe, and that \"the German view and the French view actually need each other to be sustainable.\"\n\nBen Bernanke, former Chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve praised the book for its insightful contribution to the history of economics: \"International divergences in economic policy are as much the result of differences in intellectual frameworks as of variation in economic circumstances. This valuable book explains the critical differences in national economic philosophies and how they have conditioned policy choices over the past decade.\"\n\nLawrence Summers, former Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, claimed that \"This is the best and most important book so far on an experiment with profound economic and geopolitical implications.\"\n\nThe book has been a recipient of a number of awards, including \"Bloomberg’s\" Best Books of 2017, \"Project Syndicate’s\" Best Reads in 2017 (chosen by Jean Pisani-Ferry), \"The Financial Times'\" Best Economics Books of 2016, and \"The Economist’s\" Economics and Business Books of the Year 2016.\n\n"}

According to the reteller of the tale, \"A girl from Maine told it to my children. It interested them so much that I thought it worth preserving. I asked where she found it and she said an old lady told it to her in her childhood.\"\n\nIn the 1875 \"St. Nicholas\" tale, a childless old woman bakes a gingerbread man, who leaps from her oven and runs away. The woman and her husband give chase, but are unable to catch him. The gingerbread man then outruns several farm workers and farm animals, while taunting them with the phrase:\n\nThe tale ends with a fox catching and eating the gingerbread man who cries as he is devoured, \"I'm quarter gone...I'm half gone...I'm three-quarters gone...I'm all gone!\"\n\nThe Gingerbread Man remains a common subject for American children's literature into the 21st century. The retellings often omit the original ending (\"I'm quarter gone...I'm half gone...I'm three-quarters gone...I'm all gone!\") and make other changes. In some variations, the fox feigns deafness, drawing the Gingerbread Man closer and closer. Then the fox snatches and devours him. In other versions, the Gingerbread Man halts in his flight at a riverbank, and after accepting the fox's offer to ferry him across, is convinced by the fox to move ever-forward toward the fox's mouth.\n\nIn some retellings, the Gingerbread Man taunts his pursuers with the famous line: \n\nFolk tales of the runaway food type are found in Germany, the British Isles, and Eastern Europe, as well as the United States.\n\nIn Slavic lands, a traditional character known as Kolobok () is a ball of bread dough who avoids being eaten by various animals (collected by Konstantin Ushinsky in \"Native Word (Rodnoye slovo)\" in 1864). \"The Pancake\" (\"Pannekaken\") was collected by Peter Asbjornsen and Jorgen Moe and published in \"Norske Folkeeventyr\" (1842-1844), and, ten years later, the German brothers Carl and Theodor Colshorn collected \"The Big, Fat Pancake\" (\"Vom dicken fetten Pfannekuchen\") from the Salzdahlum region and published the tale in \"Märchen und Sagen\", no. 57, (1854). In 1894, Karl Gander collected \"The Runaway Pancake\" (\"Der fortgelaufene Eierkuchen\") from an Ögeln cottager and peddler and published the tale in \"Niederlausitzer Volkssagen, vornehmlich aus dem Stadt- und Landkreise Guben,\" no. 319. The Roule Galette story is a similar story from France.\n\nAn interesting variation of this trope is found in the Hungarian tale \"The Little Dumpling\" (\"A kis gömböc\"), and contrary to the title the main character is not a dumpling, but the Hungarian version of head cheese. In the tale it is the gömböc that eats the others; it first consumes the family that \"made\" it, and then, rolling on the road, it eats various others – including a whole army – the last of whom is a swineherd. His knife opens the gömböc from the inside, and the people run home. In another variation the gömböc bursts after eating too many people. A similar Russian tale is called \"The Clay Guy\" (). In it, an old childless couple make themselves a clay child, who first eats all their food, then them, then a number of people, until he meets a goat who offers to jump right into his mouth, but instead uses the opportunity to ram the clay guy, shattering him and freeing everyone. The Czech folk tale Otesánek (and the 2000 movie with the same name) follows a similar plot.\n\nJoseph Jacobs published \"Johnny-Cake\" in his \"English Fairy Tales\" (1890), basing his tale on a version found in the \"American Journal of Folk-Lore.\" Jacobs' johnny-cake rolls rather than runs, and the fox tricks him by pretending to be deaf and unable to hear his taunting verse. In \"The Wee Bannock\" from \"More English Fairy Tales\" (1894), Jacobs records a Scottish tale with a bannock as hero.\n\nThe musical \"The Gingerbread Man\" (music by Alfred Baldwin Sloane, book and lyrics by Frederic G. Ranken) opened on Broadway on Christmas Day 1905, and ran for five months. The massive production then moved to Chicago with most of its New York cast and continued a successful tour of smaller venues in the U.S. for at least another four years. In this show the titular character, a gingerbread man, is named John Dough (\"John Dough\" being another term for a gingerbread man that was current at the time). While the gingerbread man is not the main character, he was played by the crowd favorite Eddie Redway and caught the attention of audiences and critics. The gingerbread man idea was also heavily promoted by the producers: 25,000 dough statuettes were given away in New York City to promote the show. This John Dough had few resemblances to the Gingerbread Man of the 1875 story described above. He claims to be a scapegoat rather than a troublemaker: \"They are looking for me high and low, I'm wanted for that, I'm wanted for this, For any old thing that has gone amiss.\" Ranken's John Dough gingerbread man has few qualms about being eaten; he seems to fear obscurity more: \"A little boy buys me with a cent . . . And removes an arm or leg or two, As down his throat I gently float, How can that hopeful know, Unless he is told, That he's stowed in his hold, The original John Dough.\"\n\nL. Frank Baum's \"John Dough and the Cherub\" (1906) and \"The Road to Oz\" (1909), also contained a gingerbread man named John Dough. Baum's John Dough is a life-sized creation and scared of being eaten, but ultimately sacrifices his hand to save a child's life. The Baum 1906 story also helped popularize the meme of the Gingerbread Man, although Baum's tale, like Ranken's, contained few elements of the original story.\n\nSome tales have settings and cultural connections beyond Europe, such as Eric Kimmel's \"The Runaway Tortilla\" (2000) about a desert-roving tortilla who avoids donkeys, rattlesnakes, and buckaroos only to be defeated by crafty Señor Coyote; the Hanukkah version called \"The Runaway Latkes\" (2000) by Leslie Kimmelman; and Ying Chang Compestine's Chinese New Year tale, \"The Runaway Rice Cake\" (2001). Peter Armour's \"Stop That Pickle!\" (2005) is a tale about a runaway deli pickle. \"Marsupial Sue Presents \"The Runaway Pancake\"\" follows a similar plotline about a pancake whose hubris gets the best of him.\nModern twists on the tale that retain a gingerbread man as the protagonist include Janet Squires' \"The Gingerbread Cowboy\"; \"The Gingerbread Kid Goes to School\" (2002) by Joan Holub; and Lisa Campbell's \"The Gingerbread Girl\" (2006). In 1992 Jon Sciezka published \"The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales\". \"The Stinky Cheese Man\" is a rendition of \"The Gingerbread Man\" where the stinky cheese man runs away from everyone fearing that they will eat him, when really everyone just wants to get away from his smell. In 2018 Stephen Dixon published a sequel entitled \"The Gingerbread Man 2: What Happened Later?\".\n\nThe tale was used by The Residents in their 1994 album \"Gingerbread Man\".

It consists largely of essays about technology and life experiences, but its major selling point is the inclusion of the incomplete novel on which Adams was working at the time of his death, \"The Salmon of Doubt\" (from which the collection gets its title, a reference to the Irish myth of the Salmon of Knowledge).\n\nEnglish editions of the book were published in the United States and UK in May 2002, exactly one year after the author's death.\n\n\"The Salmon of Doubt\" was originally intended to be a Dirk Gently novel. The plot, set a few weeks after the events in \"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\", involves Dirk Gently refusing to help find the missing half of a cat, receiving large amounts of money from an unknown client, and then flying to the United States. Dirk pays a visit to Kate Schechter (who had first appeared in \"The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul\") and tells her that prior to the potential client, he had been so bored that he had started a habit of dialling his own phone number and discovered he'd answered his own calls.\nA faxed summary reprinted before the text mentions travelling \"through the nasal membranes of a rhinoceros, to a distant future dominated by estate agents and heavily armed kangaroos.\"\n\nThe version in the published book was described as the strongest content from several unfinished drafts that were written.\n\nAdams said that while he originally planned on writing a third Dirk Gently book, the ideas which he had for it would have fit better into another Hitchhiker's book: \"A lot of the stuff which was originally in \"The Salmon of Doubt\" really wasn't working\", and he planned on \"salvaging some of the ideas that I couldn't make work in a Dirk Gently framework and putting them in a Hitchhiker framework... and for old time's sake I may call it \"The Salmon of Doubt\".\" He had expressed dissatisfaction with the fifth \"Hitchhiker\" book, \"Mostly Harmless\", saying \"People have said, quite rightly, that \"Mostly Harmless\" is a very bleak book. And it was a bleak book. I would love to finish \"Hitchhiker\" on a slightly more upbeat note, so five seems to be a wrong kind of number; six is a better kind of number.\"\n\nThe book as published is divided into two main sections: \"Life, the Universe and Everything\", which utilizes fiction, essays and interviews with Adams, and \"The Salmon of Doubt\", which presents the most complete version of the novel as Adams left it.\n\nThe first section is then subdivided into three: \"Life\" touches upon Adams' own life, \"The Universe\" covers Adams' views of reality and \"Everything\", which is more wide open and includes the original version of the Hitchhiker's short story \"Young Zaphod Plays It Safe\".\n\nThe UK edition includes an introduction by Stephen Fry, and the US edition, instead, by Christopher Cerf. The audiobook edition consists of 7 CDs, mostly read by Simon Jones, but also includes both of the introductions, read by their respective authors, as well as the tributes written and read by Richard Dawkins. US paperback editions have yet another introduction, written by Terry Jones, and omit some material due to issues with copyright.\n\nThe fourteenth printing of the UK/Canadian paperback, , differs in content from the ninth printing of the US hardcover edition, , in the following ways. The paperback contains a foreword written by Stephen Fry; the hardcover contains an introduction by Christopher Cerf. Adams's letter to David Vogel on page 168 has Adams's London address at the top in the hardcover, but it is missing from the paperback. \"The Private Life of Genghis Khan\" has been omitted from the paperback.\n\nThe US mass market paperback edition contains everything in the US hardcover edition, and adds \"An Introduction to the Introduction to the New Edition\" and an \"Introduction to the New Edition\", both by Terry Jones. The material that was omitted from the UK/Canadian paperback edition is intact in the US mass market paperback edition.\n\n\nBBC Radio 4 had commissioned a third Dirk Gently six-part radio series for broadcast in mid-2010, based on the uncompleted chapters of \"The Salmon of Doubt\", and written by \"Spice World\" writer Kim Fuller. These plans have been dropped in favour of creating a television adaption of the two complete novels.\n\n"}

Today Tizatlan is a part of the modern city of Tlaxcala, and the Pre-Columbian city is visible as a small archaeological site. The site is in the state of Tlaxcala in central Mexico.\n\nTizatlan was the third of the four altepemeh to be founded, but at the time of the Spanish conquest of Mexico it was, along with Ocotelolco, the most powerful of the four allied communities. Where Ocotelolco held the economical power, having the main market in the region, Tizatlan had the military power and commanded the Tlaxcallan armies. \n\nWhen the Spanish arrived in Mexico Tizatlan was ruled by the aging Xicotencatl I \"the Elder\" aided by his son the military leader Xicotencatl II \"the Younger\". Through a series of political events Ocotelolco finally achieved dominance over Tizatlan at the end of the conquest. \n\n"}

The song was written by Jamie Delano and has since been recorded as a song by the musical group Spiderlegs. The song is notable for being fictionally part of the \"Hellblazer\" stories, and was said to be written by John Constantine and his band Mucous Membrane.\n\nThe lyrics and video for the song were printed in \"Hellblazer Annual 1\", written by Jamie Delano with art by Dean Motter. In the story, the song was the only single that Mucous Membrane, John Constantine's punk band, ever released. It was written by John Constantine and Gary Lester and released in 1978, by \"Snot Music\" record label.\n\nIt has gained a cult following, and many fan-made recordings were made. In 2006, fans of Hellblazer (including the music group Spiderlegs) created a rough version of the song. It is unmixed and unmastered, and the vocals were never properly recorded; nevertheless, it can be found. The song took another recording with a better quality and was released soon after. Spiderlegs sang the song with a fake accent. Spiderlegs said, \"The goal was to try to make something so bad it was good.\"\n\nJamie Delano wrote the lyrics. The setting of the story which the song is written is in the 1970-80. And so the lyrics is based much on history formed in that era, such as the Cold War and the Vietnam War. President Nixon and the Apollo missions were also referenced. But as this being a DC imprint, many of its elements are incorporated, such as a reference of Superman in the song. The lyrics itself contains elements of anarchy, pessimism, and violence by war.\n\nA video was created to accompany the music and was released on YouTube. The video is composed of layers from \"Hellblazer Annual 1\", with panels from the story including the supposed to be composer John Constantine and the Mucous Membrane, and their concert in The Casanova Club in Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nThe song gained a cult following in the comics community. Upon hearing the song, Jamie Delano remarked, \"Thanks for the MP3. I enjoyed the rendition. Very authentic late 'seventies atmosphere. Almost made me nostalgic.\"\n\n"}
