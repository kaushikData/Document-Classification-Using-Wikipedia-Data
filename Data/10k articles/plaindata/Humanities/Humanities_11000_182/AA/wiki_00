The layout of the settlement and buildings suggest that Allahdino was involved with administrative role.\n\nLarge quantities of copper objects, triangular terracotta cakes, seals, small terracotta jars with profusions of gold, silver, bronze and other ornaments were found. Several jars, one containing gold and silver ornaments, were also found here. A belt containing 36 carnelian beads was found, proof of highly skilled workers being settled in the area.\nArcheologists believe that findings of gold and silver ornaments, as well as the usage of stone at the village indicate some of the residents were well to do.

Aesthetics is derived from the Greek word \"aisthetikos\" which is defined as a perception of the senses. To arrive at this impression, there is a process of individual analysis, perception and imagination. Perception is defined as an individual's neurophysiological process of becoming aware of, and interpreting external stimuli. Therefore, aesthetics is highly subjective and will differ from one individual to the next. Cultures have unique systems of interpretation across time.\n\nThere are several varying definitions or interpretations of aesthetics. Aesthetics can also be used as a synonym to define taste or style. This encapsulates artistic expression, artistic activities like rhetoric, tone, harmony, painting, composition art or music. It may also encapsulate natural forms and how something may look, feel or sound. Furthermore, it encompasses the science of how an individual or society perceives, feels, senses or knows something.\n\nAs a philosophy, aesthetics was developed in 18th CE Germany by Emmanuel Kant. However, Greek and Roman philosophers such as Aristotle and Plato partook in the rhetorical debate of aesthetic perception and properties as its own branch of philosophy. The parameters of art and beauty, that define aesthetics, were initially inspired by ancient thought as presented by philosophers. like Plato and Aristotle. The parameters of art and beauty that define aesthetics were initially inspired by ancient thought. Ancient aesthetics demonstrates origin of aesthetic debate and demonstrates inspirations for modern aesthetic definitions.\n\nAncient is defined as an early historical period that is identified by the dawn of the oldest known civilizations. Ancient history is the study of life and events during this period in early history. \n\nCivilizations that fall under classification of ancient are: Ancient Greece (800 B.C. and 500 B.C,) The Incas (1438 A.D – 1532 A.D,) The Aztecs (1345 A.D – 1521 A.D), The Romans (550 BC – 465 B.C,) the Persians (550 BC – 465 B.C), Chinese civilization (1600 BCE-1046 BCE,) Mayan civilization (2600 BC-900 A.D,) Ancient Egypt (3100 BCE-2686 BCE), Indus Valley civilization (3300 BC -1900 BC) and Mesopotamia (3500 BC -500 BC.) \n\nAncient or archaic Greece is classified as the time period between 800 B.C. and 500 B.C.\n\nBeauty in ancient Greece (800-300 BCE) was referred to as κάλλος. The history of ancient Greek aesthetics spans centuries.Philosophical theories of beauty through this era fall under categories of proportion, functionality and the Form.\n\nInfluence of beauty was derived from their Gods. Greek gods were believed to take a divine human form and inspired their perception of divine beauty. Temples were created in Greece to worship these gods and were filled with life-like images of them. \n\nTheir gods were believed to take a divine human form and inspired their perception of divine beauty. Temples were created in Greece to worship these gods and were filled with life-like images of them. \n\nAncient Greeks were fixated on the aesthetic form of the human body. This ideal was captured through the art of this era. Sculptures were inspired initially by the monumental art of the Ancient Egyptians. Sculptures were perceived to be at their peak of aesthetics when the human form was captured in a unique way and emphasizing a divine or godlike quality. Proportion, poise and perfection of the human form were the artistic and aesthetic ideals. Stone and bronze monuments are iconic of this civilization. \n\nAncient Egyptians of both sexes regarded physical beauty with the utmost importance and performed beauty rituals to enhance their appearance. Artifacts have been found to support ancient Egyptian beauty ideals. Human beauty was enhanced through archaic forms of makeup. This includes copper and silver handheld mirrors and combs. Makeup was creating using siltstones palettes to grind minerals like green malachite or kohl. There is also evidence that human hair was used to create hair extensions and wigs. Jewellery was also used to enhance appearance, including a string of beads and carnelian pendants in the shape of poppy heads. \n\nThe Ancient Egyptians believed in an afterlife. Tombs were created for the dead and decorated with the highest form of their aesthetic principles. Mummy masks and coffins were painted with emphasized eyes, lined with dramatic black outlines. \n"}

In many ways, the theorem derives from the longer-established structural functionalism, yet the two theorems diverge from one another significantly. While both maintain the fundamental belief that a social structure is composed of many interdependent frames of reference, biological functionalists criticise the structural view that a social solidarity and collective conscience is required in a functioning system. By that fact, biological functionalism maintains that our individual survival and health is the driving provocation of actions, and that the importance of social rigidity is negligible.\n\nAlthough the actions of humans without doubt do not always engender positive results for the individual, a biological functionalist would argue that the intention was still self-preservation, albeit unsuccessful. An example of this is the belief in luck as an entity; while a disproportionately strong belief in good luck may lead to undesirable results, such as a huge loss in money from gambling, biological functionalism maintains that the newly created ability of the gambler to condemn luck will allow them to be free of individual blame, thus serving a practical and individual purpose. In this sense, biological functionalism maintains that while bad results often occur in life, which do not serve any pragmatic concerns, an entrenched cognitive psychological motivation was attempting to create a positive result, in spite of its eventual failure.\n"}

Made with tempera on silt plaster using a \"al secco\" fresco technique, it depicts Petros, the bishop of Faras between 974 and 997. The anonymous work was discovered in the ruins of Faras Cathedral, an important religious centre of Nubia, in modern Sudan. Rescued from flooding when Lake Nasser was created, since 1964 it is part of the Faras Gallery of the National Museum in Warsaw.\n\nThe painting, which used to be part of a larger composition, representing King Georgios II of Makuria with the Virgin and Child, was painted on the west wall of the chapel located in the southern nave of the cathedral. The portrait of the bishop was placed to the right of the image of the king. The representation of the two highest hierarchs of the state along with their patron saints indicated the supernatural origin of the power of the nobles and symbolized the unity of the clerical and secular power.\n\nThe image was created in Petros' lifetime, which is suggested by the inscription in Greek accompanying the painting, wishing him \"many years [of life]\". The painting is considered one of the most precious images of Nubian officials found in the Cathedral of Faras and is also one of six best preserved portraits of bishops discovered there.\n\nThe painting, like most other pieces of in the of the National Museum in Warsaw, was recovered by Polish archaeologists during the so-called Nubian Campaign, an international effort led by UNESCO prior to construction of the Nasser Dam. The excavations, carried out between 1961 and 1964, discovered a religious complex in the town of Faras (ancient Pachoras), near modern Sudanese-Egyptian border. Well-preserved ruins of a large Christian cathedral from 7th to 14th centuries contained well-preserved wall religious paintings.\n\nSince the area was to be flooded by the waters of the artificial Lake Nasser, a team of Polish archaeologists led by Kazimierz Michałowski was allowed to recover the artifacts. A major part was then transported to the National Museum of Sudan, where a team of Polish scientists led by Józef Gazy carried out . Some 40 per cent were transported to the National Museum of Warsaw, becoming the nucleus of the future Faras Gallery.\n\nThe image itself was painted by an anonymous artist some time during bishop Petros' tenure, between 974 and 999 AD. It represents the so-called yellow and red style, typical of a transitional period between the white style of 9th century and later multicolour style introduced in the 11th century and typical of all later wall paintings at Faras until its abandonment in the 14th century. Other images representative of the yellow and red style found at Faras represent King Georgios, a \"Virgin and Child\", \"Three Men in the Fiery Furnace\", as well as a Passion Cycle. The red and yellow style paintings are considered among the most interesting, both visually and for their theological message.\n\nThe dark-skinned bishop is depicted wearing his liturgical robes, complete with a narrow, white handkerchief (\"encheiron\") wound around the index finger of his right palm. With it he points at a Gospel Book he holds in his other arm.\n\nPetros is dressed in a long white robe (\"sticharion\") with vertical green stripes. His yellow \"phelonion\" (a type of chasuble), in the shape of an elongated ellipse, is adorned with a pattern of a red net, with precious stones sewn into the fabric. The edge of the chasuble is also adorned with a strip of fabric with green and red jewels. Bishop's \"epitrachelion\" is decorated with yellow wheels with a green circuit and red rectangles. The \"omophorion\", one of symbols of episcopal dignity, is white with a pattern of circles and rectangles. The head of the bishop is wrapped in a turban characteristic of the Coptic Church hierarchs, which could suggest that Petros was a monophysite.\n\nBehind the bishop stands Saint Peter the Apostle, dressed in a white crown signifying martyrdom. The saint has both hands on the shoulders of the bishop. This pose, common in Nubian painting of the epoch, signifies the fact that the saint protects and supports the bishop, but also points at the supernatural character of bishop's power.\n\nAround the head of Saint Peter there is a black inscription in Greek: SAINT PETER THE APOSTLE MARTYR OF THE CROSS ABBA PETROS BISHOP AND METROPOLITAN OF PACHORAS [may he live] MANY YEARS.\n\n"}

Brunton is well known for innovation in the categories of recreational compasses, navigational equipment, and survey instruments.\n\nDavid W. Brunton, a Canadian-born geologist and mining engineer, and William Aimsworth, a skilled watch repairman, founded Brunton in 1895. The firm is most famous for its earliest product, the Brunton Pocket Transit®. Geologists, foresters, surveyors, and archaeologists use this handheld compass and clinometer. Often simply called a \"Brunton\", the \"Pocket Transit\" was first patented in 1894 by David Brunton, who commissioned William Ainsworth & Sons to manufacture his invention in Denver, Colorado. \nThe company later incorporated as William Ainsworth Inc. and for many years produced the \"Pocket Transit\" along with surveying transits, theodolites, and other instruments.\n\nBy 1965, William Ainsworth Inc. was owned by a series of corporate conglomerates, and product quality varied as the company changed hands repeatedly. In 1972, a group of businessmen from Riverton, Wyoming bought the company and formed Brunton, Inc. In Riverton, Brunton began producing a new series of recreational outdoor compasses, hunting knives, and binoculars in addition to the \"Brunton Pocket Transit\".\n\nIn 1996, the company was acquired by Silva of Sweden AB, the original Swedish-based manufacturer of the \"Silva\" brand compass. Initially, Brunton sold Silva of Sweden compasses and GPS devices imported from Sweden under the \"Elite\" \"Pro Elite\", \"Nexus\", and \"MNS\" labels (Johnson Outdoors retained the exclusive rights to the \"Silva\" ® brand name in North America). Brunton began sourcing some of its compass models from Asia.\n\nIn 2006, the Silva Group was acquired by the Finnish Fiskars Corporation. Along with the rest of the Silva Group, Brunton became part of the Outdoor division of Fiskars. As of 2009, Brunton, Inc. employed about 40 people.\n\nIn December 2009, Fiskars announced the sale of Brunton Inc. to Fenix Outdoor AB, a Swedish company. As a result of Fiskars divestment of Brunton Inc., Silva of Sweden AB ceased all exports of its Swedish-made compasses and GPS devices to North America, including the \"Nexus\", \"Elite\", and \"Pro Elite\" lines. In turn, Brunton ceased export of its model 8020, 8040, and 9020 compasses to Silva of Sweden AB. \n\nAs of March 2012, the company employed around 68 people at its Riverton, Wyoming manufacturing facility.\n\nAs William Ainsworth Inc., production of the \"Pocket Transit™\" continued\".\" The \"Pocket Transit\" remains in production today, and is offered in numerous versions and configurations. In 1970, the company introduced the \"Brunton Cadet\", a simplified evolution of the Pocket Transit incorporating a compass and clinometer, intended for use in training students in the fields of geology, forestry, mining, and surveying. The company soon began marketing the \"Cadet\" to instruct Boy Scouts in the principles of surveying. \n\nIn 1972, the newly formed Brunton, Inc. began compass and transit production in Riverton, Wyoming. Compasses included the \"Pocket Transit\", \"Cadet\", and an emergency compass called the \"Life Card\", designed to float in a bowl of water. This was followed in 1981 by the Model 8040 \"Sportsman's Compass\"™, a map (baseplate) compass with folding cover and mirror sight. In the same year, Brunton introduced the Model 9020. This small baseplate compass was designed for hikers, outdoorsmen, and hunters.\n\nOver the next ten years, Brunton would introduce a full range of map or baseplate compasses based on a liquid-filled vial with \"no-tools adjustment\" for magnetic declination. This new line included Models \"8010\", \"8020\", \"8040\", \"9020\", and the compact 9030 \"Trailbuster\". Brunton baseplate compasses with a G suffix (i.e. \"9020G)\" featured bright yellow-green acrylic baseplates. Brunton often included UTM and map scales for U.S. standard 1:24,000 and 1:62,500 USGS topographic maps. The \"Model 9030 Trailbuster\"™, intended to replicate the popular 1960s-era Taylor \"Model 2912\" field compass, omitted the baseplate in order to minimize space and weight.\n\nIn 1991, the U.S. military purchased a number of Brunton Model \"8010\" \"Smoke Chaser\"™ compasses originally produced for U.S. Forest Service fire-fighting crews. These were stocked in survival kits for U.S. Navy and Marine flight crews. These Model 8010 compasses used clear baseplates and were equipped with lanyards. The compasses were shipped in plain cardboard boxes with military stock number NSN 6605-00-553-8795. Brunton discontinued all 8000- and 9000- series compasses in 2011.\n\nAfter being aquired by Silva, Brunton began selling Silva of Sweden compasses and GPS devices. The Nexus line included the Silva Model 15T and Model 25 \"Ranger\" compasses, rebranded as the Nexus 15TDC and 25TDC Pro Elite. Brunton also began importing some compass models from Taiwan and mainland China, including the \"Model 9030\" and \"Models 9075\" and \"9077\" lensatic compasses. Silva of Sweden also sold some Brunton models under the Silva \"Voyager\"™ name.\n\nIn 1998, Brunton introduced its \"Eclipse™\" range of liquid-filled baseplate compasses featuring low-profile vials, a magnified readout in 1-degree increments, and a patented \"circle-over-circle\" magnetized disk in place of a traditional pointed needle. The \"Eclipse\" compasses included the \"Model 8096 GPS\", the \"Model 8097\", and the \"Model 8099 Pro\". Like older Brunton outdoor compasses, the \"Eclipse\" series used \"no-tools\" adjustable declination. Designed by Brunton, but imported from China, some owners of \"Eclipse\" compasses reported issues with air bubbles forming in the compass vials.\n\nIn 2000, Brunton introduced an electronic fluxgate compass called the \"Brunton Outback\"™. Imported from Taiwan, the \"Outback\" featured gimbal-mounted magnetic sensors which allowed the unit to be tilted up to 15 degrees while producing accurate readings. The \"Outback\" stored up to 10 bearings in its memory. A night navigation mode warned if the user was moving off-track with illuminated arrows. The \"Outback\" was eventually replaced by the Brunton \"Nomad\"™ electronic compass. After complaints about calibration and inaccurate bearings, the \"Nomad\" was discontinued in 2011. \nIn 2009, Brunton stopped selling most Silva of Sweden products. The \"Nexus\" and \"Elite\" lines were discontinued, as well as the \"Brunton 54LU\" (\"Silva Model 54).\" The \"Brunton 54LU\" was marketed to foresters, surveyors, geologists, and SAR teams before being discontinued. Some Silva models, including the \"Brunton 15TDCL\" and \"Brunton 16DLU\", were later sourced from a production facility in China. In 2011, Brunton discontinued the Models 8010G, 8020, 8040G, 9020G, and 9030 compasses.\n\nIn 2012, Brunton introduced a new series of outdoor compasses called \"O.S.S.\"™ (\"Orbital Sighting System)\". Like the \"Eclipse\" series, the O.S.S.™ compasses featured a large liquid-filled capsule and \"circle-over-circle\" north indicator. In addition, several design improvements set the \"O.S.S.\"™ apart. These included a deep-well 'global' vial, a serrated outer bezel, a needle with an orienting circle instead of a magnetized disc, and map meridian lines imprinted in the base of the housing. Unlike older \"Eclipse\" compasses, \"O.S.S.\" compasses were assembled in Riverton, Wyoming from components made in the United States. As of 2012, Brunton is the only major compass manufacturer with U.S.-based production facilities.\n\nIn 2014, Brunton dropped the circle-over-circle magnetized disk/needle design used in the \"Eclipse\" and \"O.S.S.\" series. Their current line of baseplate compasses, the TruArc™ series uses rare-earth magnets to stabilize the north indicator (needle), These compasses are designed to work in all magnetic zones. \n\nIn 2000, Silva of Sweden AB introduced its Silva \"Multi-Navigator\" GPS device. Brunton marketed the product in North America as the Brunton \"MNS\"™. The \"MNS\" featured an electronic compass, barometer, and barometric altimeter in addition to GPS functionality. With a relatively high energy consumption of 210 mA (or 270 mA with illumination on), the \"MNS\" had a battery life of around 10 hours. At $399, the \"Brunton MNS\" faced intense competition competitors such as \"Garmin\" and \"Magellan.\" Products with better battery life and improved scrolling menu displays kep the \"MNS\" from gaining significant market share. Furthermore, the \"MNS\" was not WAAS capable and did not offer internal storage of waypoints, routes or tracks. In 2004, Silva and Brunton introduced a slightly lower-priced, WAAS-capable GPS receiver called the \"Atlas\"™. This product also failed to gain a significant share of the handheld GPS market, and the Brunton \"MNS\" and \"Atlas\" were both discontinued by Brunton in 2009.\n\nIn 1992, Brunton introduced a line of binoculars and other optical equipment aimed at the hunting and outdoor recreation market. The optics line was discontinued in 2014.\n\n\n"}

Collins sent it to the Royal Academy of Arts in 1851 where it was exhibited.\n\nThe painting shows a nun contemplating a passion flower symbolising the crucifixion of Christ. She is standing in a walled garden full of minutely detailed flowers. In her left hand she holds an illuminated missal, held not as though she had been reading it but so as to show us the Annunciation and the Crucifixion. Her costume shows that she is a novice, presumably meditating on her final vows.\n\nThe flowers were painted in the Oxford garden of Thomas Combe, an early collector of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and the model was his housemaid, Frances Sarah Ludlow, later Mrs Brucker. Combe bought the painting; in 1894 he bequeathed his art collection to the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford and \"Convent Thoughts\" remains in the Museum's collection.\n\nAlthough Collins was never formally a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, he was in sympathy with their aims and painted in their immensely detailed style. \"Convent Thoughts\" has a place in the history of Pre-Raphaelitism, because the tide of opinion, initially hostile, was to some extent turned by a letter to \"The Times\" on 13 May 1851 from the influential critic John Ruskin praising the Pre-Raphaelite paintings at the Academy exhibition, in particular \"Convent Thoughts\", about which he wrote:\n\"I happen to have a special acquaintance with the water plant \"Alisma Plantago\" ... and as I never saw it so thoroughly or so well drawn, I must take leave to remonstrate with you, when you say sweepingly that these men 'sacrifice \"truth\" as well as feeling to eccentricity.' For as a mere botanical study of the Water Lily and \"Alisma\", as well as of the common lily and several other garden flowers, this picture would be invaluable to me, and I heartily wish it were mine.\"\nIn a curious footnote to this story, it has recently been pointed out that there is in fact no \"Alisma Plantago\" in the picture.\n\n\n"}

The most helpful clue was supplied by the discovery in 1799 of the Rosetta Stone, an inscription in three scripts. Building on work by several other scholars, notably Thomas Young, the breakthrough to decipherment was made by Jean-François Champollion.\n\nThe successful decipherment was preceded by a long period during which hieroglyphs were wrongly believed in Europe to be a purely ideographic script. In the 5th century appeared the \"Hieroglyphica\" of Horapollo, a spurious explanation of almost 200 glyphs. Authoritative yet largely false, the work was a lasting impediment to the decipherment of Egyptian writing. But whereas earlier scholarship emphasized Greek origin of the document, more recent work has recognized remnants of genuine knowledge, and casts it as an attempt by an Egyptian intellectual to rescue an unrecoverable past. The \"Hieroglyphica\" was a major influence on Renaissance symbolism, particularly the emblem book of Andrea Alciato, and including the \"Hypnerotomachia Poliphili\" of Francesco Colonna.\n\nLater attempts at deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs were made by Arab historians in medieval Egypt during the 9th and 10th centuries. By then, hieroglyphs had long been forgotten in Egypt, and were replaced by the Coptic and Arabic alphabets. Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya were the first historians to be able to at least partly decipher what was written in the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, by relating them to the contemporary Coptic language used by Coptic priests in their time. Arabic manuscripts of Ibn Wahshiyya's work were later read by Athanasius Kircher in the 17th century, and then translated and published in English by Joseph Hammer in 1806 as \"Ancient Alphabets and Hieroglyphic Characters Explained; with an Account of the Egyptian Priests, their Classes, Initiation, and Sacrifices in the Arabic Language by Ahmad Bin Abubekr Bin Wahishih\", contributing to the complete decipherment of hieroglyphs.\n\nThe study of hieroglyphs continued centuries later, when various modern scholars attempted to decipher the glyphs, notably Johannes Goropius Becanus in the 16th century, Athanasius Kircher in the 17th, and Silvestre de Sacy, Johan David Åkerblad and Thomas Young in the early 19th century, each making one important step toward the solution but failing to find it.\n\nYoung made the crucial breakthrough in 1814 when studying the Rosetta Stone. Guessing that hieroglyphs surrounded by a loop were of greater importance, such as representing a pharaoh's name, he was able to discover the phonetics of the corresponding hieroglyphs by comparing the three different scripts. After identifying many of the hieroglyphs' sound values, he set aside his work for reasons not fully understood.\n\nAthanasius Kircher, a student of Coptic and Arabic, had read Ibn Wahshiyya's work in the 17th century and continued the study of hieroglyphs from where Ibn Wahshiyya had left off. Kircher further developed the notion that the last stage of Egyptian could be related to the earlier Egyptian stages. Because he was not able to transliterate or translate hieroglyphs, however, he could not prove this notion.\n\nThe discovery in 1799 of the Rosetta Stone by Napoleon's troops (during Napoleon's Egyptian invasion) provided the critical information which allowed Jean-François Champollion, taking into the account the work of other scholars, to discover the nature of the script by the 1820s. He had been introduced to hieroglyphics at the tender age of 10 and so began a lifelong fascination.\n\nA significant breakthrough was made by Champollion in 1822, as reflected in his well-known \"Lettre à M. Dacier\":\n\"It is a complex system, writing figurative, symbolic, and phonetic all at once, in the same text, the same phrase, I would almost say in the same word.\" \nHe had applied Young's approach to an obelisk inscribed in Greek and hieroglyphics and correlated sound values to individual glyphs by applying comparisons to the names Ptolemy and Cleopatra. An important assumption made by Champollion was that certain sounds (such as 't') could be represented by two glyphs, just as they are in English with different letters (such as the hard 'c' and 'k'). He then began to study other inscriptions, flush with this discovery.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55027", "title": "Epipalaeolithic", "text": "Epipalaeolithic\n\nIn archaeology, the Epipalaeolithic or Epipaleolithic (sometimes Epi-paleolithic etc.) is a term for a period intervening between the Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic in the Stone Age. This position is also occupied by the Mesolithic and the two are sometimes confused, or used as synonyms. More often they are used for different areas: Epipaleolithic for the Levant (Middle East near the Mediterranean coast), and the Near East in general, as well as sometimes parts of Europe other than North and Western Europe, where Mesolithic is much more often used. A Mesolithic period is not usually recognized for the Levant or Near East; in Europe a period categorized as Epipalaeolithic is followed by a Mesolithic one in the same area, and will itself be described as Mesolithic by many archaeologists. \n\nThe Epipalaeolithic has been defined as the \"final Upper Palaeolithic industries occurring at the end of the final glaciation which appear to merge technologically into the Mesolithic\". The period is generally dated from  BP to 10,000 BP in the Levant, but later in Europe. If used as a synonym or equivalent for Mesolithic in Europe, it might end at about  BP or even later.\n\nIn the Levant the period may be subdivided into Early, Middle and Late Epipaleolithic, the last also being the Natufian. The preceding final Upper Paleolithic period is the Kebaran or \"Upper Paleolithic Stage VI\".\n\nEpipalaeolithic hunter-gatherers, generally nomadic, made relatively advanced tools from small flint or obsidian blades, known as microliths, that were hafted in wooden implements. There are settlements with \"flimsy structures\", probably not permanently occupied except at some rich sites, but used and returned to seasonally.\n\nIn describing the period before the start of the Neolithic, \"Epipaleolithic\" is typically used for cultures in regions that were far from the glaciers of the Ice Age, so that the retreat of the glaciers made a less dramatic change to conditions. This was the case in the Levant. Conversely, the term \"Mesolithic\" is most likely to be used for Western Europe where climatic change and the extinction of the megafauna had a great impact of the paleolithic populations at the end of the Ice Age, creating post-glacial cultures such as the Azilian, Sauveterrian, Tardenoisian, and Maglemosian. In the past, French archaeologists had a general tendency to prefer the term \"Epipaleolithic\" to \"Mesolithic\", even for Western Europe. Where \"Epipaleolithic\" is still used for Europe, it is generally for areas close to the Mediterranean, as with the Azilian industry. \n\n\"Epipalaeolithic\" stresses the continuity with the Upper Paleolithic. Alfonso Moure says in this respect:\nIn Europe, the Epipalaeolithic may be regarded as a period preceding the Early Mesolithic, or as locally constituting at least a part of it. Other authors treat the Epipalaeolithic as part of the Late Palaeolithic; the culture in southern Portugal between about 10,500 to 8,500 years ago is \"variously labelled as 'Terminal Magdalenian' and 'Epipalaeolithic. The different usages often reflect the degree of innovation and \"economic intensification in the direction of domestication, sedentism or environmental modification\" seen in the culture. If the Palaeolithic way of life continues with only adaptation to reflect changes in the types of wild food available, the culture may be called Epipalaeolithic. One writer, talking of Azilian microliths in Vasco-Cantabria has \"some exceptions that seem to herald the coming of 'true' Mesolithic technologies a few centuries later\".\n\nThe concept of the \"Epipalaeolithic\" arrived several decades after the main components of the three-age system, the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic. It was first proposed in 1910 by the Swedish archaeologist, Knut Stjerna, his initial example being a culture or sub-culture in Scandinavian archaeology, that would not be often called Epipalaeolithic today. This left stone-lined pit graves containing implements of bone, such as harpoon and javelin heads. Stjerna observed that they \"persisted during the recent Paleolithic period and also during the Protoneolithic\". Here he had used a new term, \"Protoneolithic\", which was according to him to be applied to the Danish kitchen-middens. Stjerna also said that the eastern culture \"is attached to the Paleolithic civilization\" (\"se trouve rattachée à la civilisation paléolithique\"). However, it was not intermediary and of its intermediates he said \"we cannot discuss them here\" (\"nous ne pouvons pas examiner ici\"). This \"attached\" and non-transitional culture he chose to call the Epipaleolithic, defining it as follows:\nWith Epipaleolithic I mean the period during the early days that followed the age of the reindeer, the one that retained Paleolithic customs. This period has two stages in Scandinavia, that of Maglemose and that of Kunda. (\"Par époque épipaléolithique j'entends la période qui, pendant les premiers temps qui ont suivi l'âge du Renne, conserve les coutumes paléolithiques. Cette période présente deux étapes en Scandinavie, celle de Maglemose et de Kunda.\")\n\nStjerna made no mention of the Mesolithic, and it is unclear if he intended his terms to replace that. His new terms were soon adopted by the German Hugo Obermaier, who in 1916 used them in \"El Hombre fósil\" (translated into English in 1924) as part of an attack on the concept of the Mesolithic, which he insisted was a period of \"transition\" and an \"interim\" rather than \"transformation\": \n\nBut in my opinion this term is not justified, as it would be if these phases presented a natural evolutionary development – a progressive transformation from Paleolithic to Neolithic. In reality, the final phase of the Capsian, the Tardenoisian, the Azilian and the northern Maglemose industries are the posthumous descendants of the Palaeolithic ...\n\nThis early history of the term introduced the ambiguity and degree of confusion which has continued to surround its use, as least as relates to the archaeology of Europe.\n\n"}

Eternity clauses are a type of entrenched clause in the constitutions of the Czech Republic, Germany, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Morocco, the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Federative Republic of Brazil and Norway.\n\nThe Constitution of India and the Constitution of Colombia contain similar provisions aimed at making it difficult, but not impossible, to change their basic structure.\n\nArticle 60 paragraph 4th of the Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil, lists four subject areas of the Constitution that cannot be amended:\n\nThere are other clauses that implicitly cannot be amended, mostly because they are dependent of the subjects above.\n\nThe Czech Constitution contains an explicit eternity clause, whereby the Czech constitutional court assumes the role of ultimate arbiter of the effect of European law on the constitution.\n\nThe German eternity clause (German: \"Ewigkeitsklausel\") is Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (German: \"Grundgesetz\"). The eternity clause establishes that certain fundamental principles of Germany's democracy can never be removed, even by parliament. The fundamental principles, (i.e., \"the basic principles\" of Articles 1 and 20), are as follows:\n\n\nThe \"Parlamentarischer Rat\" (Parliamentary Council) included the eternity clause in its Basic Law specifically to prevent a new \"legal\" pathway to a dictatorship as was the case in the Weimar Republic with the Enabling Act of 1933.\n\nIt is not possible for any political party, any legislation or any national commitment to violate \"the basic principles\" of \"this Basic Law\" laid down in Articles 1 and 20. Furthermore, the only way that Articles 1 and 20 can be removed is through Article 146, which requires \"a constitution that is adopted by a free decision of the German People.\" So long as the principles of Articles 1 and 20 are retained, they may be amended (as Article 20 has indeed been amended to establish a 'right of resistance'), but the full protection of the eternity clause does not extend to such amendments.\n\nUnlike the Weimar Constitution, which made human rights only an objective, the eternity clause and Articles 1 and 20 make specific demands of \"all state authority\" regarding \"human rights\" (that is, \"the basic rights\" guaranteed in \"this Basic Law\") and have established specific legislative, executive and judicial organs in \"the constitutional order\" of \"this Basic Law\", each with separate functions bound by the law. These are \"the basic principles\" of the democratic rule of law (German: \"Rechtsstaat\") and the separation of powers, which are principles endorsed by three United Nations resolutions.\n\nThe Greek eternity clause is Article 110 of the Greek Constitution. This article states that every article of the Constitution can be revised by the Parliament, except of the fundemental ones, which establish Greece as a parliamentary republic and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, article 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7, article 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, article 13 paragraph 1 and article 26. These fundamental articles include:\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has developed the basic structure doctrine which holds that certain features of the constitution are fundamental in nature and cannot be modified through parliamentary amendment. The Supreme Court has yet to clearly delimit the components of the basic structure.\n\nThe final Article of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Art. 177, ensures that particular aspects of the Constitution are unalterable. These include the Islamic character of government and laws, the objectives of the republic, the democratic character of the government, “the absolute wilayat al-'amr and the leadership of the Ummah,” the administration of the country by referendum, and the official religion of Islam.\n\nIn the Constitution of Morocco, eternity clauses exist that ensure certain provisions cannot be amended, including the role of Islam in the nation's law, and the role of the King of Morocco in law.\n\n"}
{"id": "211405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=211405", "title": "Film producer", "text": "Film producer\n\nA film producer is a person who oversees the production of a film. Either employed by a production company or working independently, producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting the script; coordinating writing, directing, and editing; and arranging financing.\n\nDuring the \"discovery stage,\" the producer finds and selects promising material for development. Then, unless the film is based on an existing script, the producer has to hire a screenwriter and oversee the development of the script. Once a script is completed, the producer will lead a pitch to secure the financial backing (a \"green light\") to allow production to begin.\n\nThe producer also supervises the pre-production, production, and post-production stages of filmmaking. One of the most important tasks is to hire the director and other key crew members. Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production, the producer typically manages the logistics and business operations, though some directors also produce their own films. The producer is tasked with making sure the film is delivered on time and within budget, and has the final say on creative decisions. Finally, the producer will oversee the marketing and distribution.\n\nFor various reasons, producers cannot always supervise all of the production. In this case, the main producer may hire and delegate work to executive producers, line producers, or unit production managers.\nDifferent types of producers and their roles within the industry today include (in no order of seniority): \n\nThe executive producer oversees all of the other producers working on the same project. They make sure that the producers are fulfilling their roles on the given production. They can also be in charge of managing the film's finances and handling all other business aspects of the film.\n\nThe line producer manages the staff and day-to-day operations and the oversees each and every physical aspect that is involved in the making of a film or television program. The line producer can be credited as \"produced by\" in certain cases.\n\nThe supervising producer supervises the creative process of screenplay development and often aids in script re-writes. They can also fulfill the executive producer's role of overseeing other producers.\n\nWithin the production process, a producer can oversee, arrange, manage, and begin every single aspect. He or she is involved in every single stage of the overall production process.\n\nA co-producer is a member of a team of producers that perform all of the functions and roles that a single producer would have in a single given project.\n\nA coordinating producer coordinates the work/role of multiple producers who are trying to achieve a shared result.\n\nThe associate or assistant producer helps the producer during the production process. He/she can sometimes be involved in coordinating others' jobs, such as creating peoples' schedules and hiring the main talent.\n\nA segment producer produces one or more single specific segments of a multi-segment film or television production.\n\nA field producer helps the producer by overseeing all of the production that takes place outside of the studio in specific locations for the film.\n\nDuring this stage of the production process, producers bring together people like the film director, cinematographer, and production designer. Unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate screenwriter. If an existing script is considered flawed, they are able to order a new version or make the decision to hire a script doctor. The producer also has the final say on which film director, cast members, or other staff get hired. In some cases, they also have the last word when it comes to casting questions. A producer's role will also consist of approving locations, the studio hire, the final shooting script, the production schedule, and the budget. More time and money spent in pre-production can reduce the time and money wasted during production time.\n\nDuring production, the producer's job is to make sure the film stays on schedule and under budget. They will always be in contact with directors and other key creative team members. In addition to this, cast and film crew often work at different times or places, and certain films even require a second unit. The executive producer of the \"Star Wars\" original trilogy was George Lucas himself, the creator of the \"Star Wars\" universe.\n\nFor various reasons, producers cannot always personally supervise all parts of their production. For example, some producers run a company which also deals with film distribution. Also, cast and film crew often work at different times and places, and certain films even require a second unit.\n\nDuring post-production, the producer has the last word on whether sounds, music, or scenes have to be changed or cut. Even if the shooting has been finished, the producers can still demand that additional scenes be filmed. In the case of a negative test screening, producers may even demand and get an alternative film ending. This happened, for example, with \"First Blood.\" The test audience reacted very negatively when Rambo died, so the producers re-shot a new ending. In addition to this, producers work with marketing and distribution companies in order to sell the film or arrange its distribution rights.\n\nWithin the industry, all of the producers union contracts are negotiated by The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP). It was founded in 1924 by the U.S Trade Association as the Association of Motion Picture Producers. It was originally created to only negotiate labor contracts, but during the mid-1930s they took over all contract negotiation responsibilities that were once controlled by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. This alliance negotiates with a wide range of other associations when dealing with producers union contracts. These associations include, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), the Directors Guild of America (DGA), and the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). They negotiate over eighty industry wide union agreements and on behalf of 350 producers within the industry. It has been responsible for negotiating all of these union contracts within the industry since 1982. Today, it is considered the industry's official contract negotiation representative for everyone within the industry.\n\nThere are many different ways to become a film producer. Stanley Kramer started as an editor and writer, while other producers started as actors or directors.\n\nHowever, most producers start in a college, university or film school. On the occasion of announcing his own film school, 'École de la Cité, film producer Luc Besson admitted that at the beginning of his career, he would have appreciated the chance to attend a film school. Film schools and many universities offer degree courses that include film production knowledge, with some courses that are especially designed for future film producers. These courses focus on key topics like pitching, script development, script assessment, shooting schedule design, and budgeting. Students can also expect practical training regarding post-production. Training at a top producing school is one of the most efficient ways a student can show professionals they are not a rookie.\n\nWhile education is one way to begin a career as a film producer, experience is also required to land a job. Internships are a great way to gain experience while in school and give students a solid foundation on which to build their career. Many internships are paid, which enable students to earn money while gaining hands-on skills from industry professionals. Through internships, students get to network with people in the film industry as well. This pays off in the end when looking for jobs after school. Once an internship is over, the next step typically will be to land a junior position, such as a production assistant.\n\nAlthough rates can vary based on a producer's role and the location of filming, the average salary can start anywhere from $20,000 to $70,000, even doubling when working in Los Angeles. The average annual salary for a producer in the U.S. is $109,844. When examining more than 15,000 producers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the average annual salary is $138,640. Producers can also have an agreement to take a percentage of a movie's sales.\n\nThere is no average work day for a film producer, since their tasks are changing from day to day. A producer's work hours are often irregular and can consist of very long days with the possibility of working nights and weekends.\n"}
{"id": "58074141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58074141", "title": "Flaubert's letters", "text": "Flaubert's letters\n\nThe letters of Gustave Flaubert, the 19th-century French novelist, range in date from 1829, when he was 7 or 8 years old, to a day or two before his death in 1880. They are considered one of the finest bodies of letters in French literature, admired even by many who are critical of Flaubert's novels. His main correspondents include family members, business associates and fellow-writers such as Théophile Gautier, the Goncourt brothers, Guy de Maupassant, Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, George Sand, Ivan Turgenev and Émile Zola. They provide a valuable glimpse of his methods of work and his literary philosophy, as well as documenting his social life, political opinions, and increasing disgust with bourgeois society.\n\n4481 letters by Flaubert survive, a number which would have been considerably higher but for a series of burnings of his letters to his friends. Many of those addressed to Maxime Du Camp, Guy de Maupassant and Louis Bouilhet were destroyed in this way. From those that survive it appears that his principal correspondents were as follows. His family members:\nHis friends, associates and readers:\n\nFlaubert's personality was rigorously excluded from his novels, but in the letters, written at night after the day's literary work was done, he expresses much more spontaneously his own personal views. Their themes often arise from his life as a reader and writer. They discuss the subject-matter and structural difficulties of his novels, and explore the problems Flaubert faced in their composition, giving the reader a unique glimpse of his art in the making. They illustrate his extensive reading of the creative literatures of France, England (he loved Shakespeare, Byron and Dickens), Germany and the classical world; also his deep researches into history, philosophy and the sciences. Above all, they constantly state and restate Flaubert's belief in the duty of the writer to maintain his independence, and in his own need to reach literary beauty through a quasi-scientific objectivity.\n\nBut his letters also demonstrate an enjoyment of the simple pleasures of Flaubert's youth. Friendship, love, conversation, a delight in foreign travel, the pleasures of the table and of the bed are all in evidence. These do not disappear in his maturer years, but they are offset by discussions of politics and current affairs which reveal an increasing disgust with society, especially bourgeois society, and with the age he lived in. They exude a sadness and a sense of having grown old before his time. As a whole, said the literary critic Eric Le Calvez, Flaubert's correspondence, \"reveals his vision of life and of the relation between life and art: since the human condition is miserable, life can be legitimated only through an eternal pursuit of art.\"\n\nFor many years after the first publication of the letters critical opinion was divided. Albert Thibaudet thought them \"the expression of a first-rate intellect\", and André Gide wrote that \"For more than five years his correspondence took the place of the Bible at my bedside. It was my reservoir of energy\". Frank Harris said that in his letters \"he lets himself go and unconsciously paints himself for us to the life; and this Gustave Flaubert is enormously more interesting than anything in \"Madame Bovary\"\". On the other hand Marcel Proust found Flaubert's epistolary style \"even worse\" than that of his novels, while for Henry James the Flaubert of the letters was \"impossible as a companion\".\n\nThis ambivalence is a thing of the past, and there is now widespread agreement that the Flaubert correspondence is one of the finest in French literature. Publication of them \"has crowned his reputation as the exemplary artist\". Enid Starkie wrote that Flaubert was one of his own greatest literary creations, and that the letters might well be seen in the future as his greatest book, and the one in which \"he has most fully distilled his personality and his wisdom\". Jean-Paul Sartre, an inveterate enemy of Flaubert's novels, considered the letters a perfect example of pre-Freudian free association, and for Julian Barnes this description \"hints at their fluency, profligacy, range and sexual frankness; to which we should add power, control, wit, emotion and furious intelligence. The \"Correspondance\"...has always added up to Flaubert's best biography.\" Rosemary Lloyd analyses the elements of their appeal as being \"partly [their] wide sweep, partly the sense of seeing what Baudelaire called the strings and pulleys of the writer's workshop, and partly the immediacy of Flaubert's changeable, complex and challenging personality.\" She continues, \"Reading Flaubert's correspondence brings startlingly alive a man of enormous complexity, of remarkable appetites and debilitating lethargies, a knotted network of prejudices, insights, blind spots, passions and ambitions.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have also been many single-correspondent editions of Flaubert's letters to one or another of his friends and associates, and selections from the collected letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "230846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230846", "title": "Futurism", "text": "Futurism\n\nFuturism () was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Gino Severini, Giacomo Balla, and Luigi Russolo. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past. Cubism contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style. Important Futurist works included Marinetti's \"Manifesto of Futurism\", Boccioni's sculpture \"Unique Forms of Continuity in Space\", Balla's painting \"Abstract Speed + Sound\", and Russolo's \"The Art of Noises\". Although it was largely an Italian phenomenon, there were parallel movements in Russia, England, Belgium and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even Futurist meals. To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements Art Deco, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and to a greater degree Precisionism, Rayonism, and Vorticism.\n\nFuturism is an avant-garde movement founded in Milan in 1909 by the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti. Marinetti launched the movement in his \"Futurist Manifesto\", which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in \"La gazzetta dell'Emilia\", an article then reproduced in the French daily newspaper \"Le Figaro\" on Saturday 20 February 1909. He was soon joined by the painters Umberto Boccioni, Carlo Carrà, Giacomo Balla, Gino Severini and the composer Luigi Russolo. Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. \"We want no part of it, the past\", he wrote, \"we the young and strong \"Futurists!\"\" The Futurists admired speed, technology, youth and violence, the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over nature, and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation, praised originality, \"however daring, however violent\", bore proudly \"the smear of madness\", dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and gloried in science.\n\nPublishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism, and the Futurists (usually led or prompted by Marinetti) wrote them on many topics, including painting, architecture, religion, clothing and cooking.\n\nThe founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, which the Futurists attempted to create in their subsequent \"Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting\" (1914). This committed them to a \"universal dynamism\", which was to be directly represented in painting. Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings: \"The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places. ... The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it.\"\n\nThe Futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter. In 1910 and 1911 they used the techniques of Divisionism, breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes, which had been originally created by Giovanni Segantini and others. Later, Severini, who lived in Paris, attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from Paris, the centre of avant-garde art. Severini was the first to come into contact with Cubism and following a visit to Paris in 1911 the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists. Cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism.\nThey often painted modern urban scenes. Carrà's \"Funeral of the Anarchist Galli\" (1910–11) is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in, in 1904. The action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes. His \"Leaving the Theatre\" (1910–11) uses a Divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights.\n\nBoccioni's \"The City Rises\" (1910) represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge, rearing red horse in the centre foreground, which workmen struggle to control. His \"States of Mind\", in three large panels, \"The Farewell\", \"Those who Go\", and \"Those Who Stay\", \"made his first great statement of Futurist painting, bringing his interests in Bergson, Cubism and the individual's complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the 'minor masterpieces' of early twentieth century painting.\" The work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time, using new means of expression, including \"lines of force\", which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space, \"simultaneity\", which combined memories, present impressions and anticipation of future events, and \"emotional ambience\" in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion.\n\nBoccioni's intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of Bergson, including the idea of intuition, which Bergson defined as a simple, indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it. The Futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted. Boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book, \"Pittura scultura Futuriste: Dinamismo plastico\" (\"Futurist Painting Sculpture: Plastic Dynamism\") (1914).\nBalla's \"Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash\" (1912) exemplifies the Futurists' insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement. The painting depicts a dog whose legs, tail and leash —and the feet of the woman walking it —have been multiplied to a blur of movement. It illustrates the precepts of the \"Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting\" that, \"On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career. Thus a running horse has not four legs, but twenty, and their movements are triangular.\" His \"Rhythm of the Bow\" (1912) similarly depicts the movements of a violinist's hand and instrument, rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame.\n\nThe adoption of Cubism determined the style of much subsequent Futurist painting, which Boccioni and Severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brush-strokes of divisionism. But Futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static Cubism of Picasso, Braque and Gris. Although there were Futurist portraits (e.g. Carrà's \"Woman with Absinthe\" (1911), Severini's \"Self-Portrait\" (1912), and Boccioni's \"Matter\" (1912)), it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified Futurist painting—e.g. Boccioni's \"The Street Enters the House\" (1911), Severini's \"Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin\" (1912), and Russolo's \"Automobile at Speed\" (1913)\n\nIn 1912 and 1913, Boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his Futurist ideas. In \"Unique Forms of Continuity in Space\" (1913) he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment, which was central to his theory of \"dynamism\". The sculpture represents a striding figure, cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the Tate Modern. (It now appears on the national side of Italian 20 eurocent coins). He explored the theme further in \"Synthesis of Human Dynamism\" (1912), \"Speeding Muscles\" (1913) and \"Spiral Expansion of Speeding Muscles\" (1913). His ideas on sculpture were published in the \"Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture\" In 1915 Balla also turned to sculpture making abstract \"reconstructions\", which were created out of various materials, were apparently moveable and even made noises. He said that, after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles, he understood that \"the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth ... I felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires, cardboard planes, cloth and tissue paper, etc.\"\n\nIn 1914, personal quarrels and artistic differences between the Milan group, around Marinetti, Boccioni, and Balla, and the Florence group, around Carrà, Ardengo Soffici (1879–1964) and Giovanni Papini (1881–1956), created a rift in Italian Futurism. The Florence group resented the dominance of Marinetti and Boccioni, whom they accused of trying to establish \"an immobile church with an infallible creed\", and each group dismissed the other as \"passéiste.\"\n\nFuturism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic. The \"Futurist Manifesto\" had declared, \"We will glorify war —the world's only hygiene —militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman.\" Although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements, it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of 1913. Then, fearing the re-election of Giolitti, Marinetti published a political manifesto. In 1914 the Futurists began to campaign actively against the Austro-Hungarian empire, which still controlled some Italian territories, and Italian neutrality between the major powers. In September, Boccioni, seated in the balcony of the Teatro dal Verme in Milan, tore up an Austrian flag and threw it into the audience, while Marinetti waved an Italian flag. When Italy entered the First World War in 1915, many Futurists enlisted. The experience of the war marked several Futurists, particularly Marinetti, who fought in the mountains of Trentino at the border of Italy and Austria-Hungary, actively engaging in propaganda. The combat experience also influenced Futurist music.\n\nThe outbreak of war disguised the fact that Italian Futurism had come to an end. The Florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of 1914. Boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in 1916. Severini painted some significant war pictures in 1915 (e.g. \"War\", \"Armored Train\", and \"Red Cross Train\"), but in Paris turned towards Cubism and post-war was associated with the Return to Order.\n\nAfter the war, Marinetti revived the movement. This revival was called \"il secondo Futurismo\" (Second Futurism) by writers in the 1960s. The art historian Giovanni Lista has classified Futurism by decades: \"Plastic Dynamism\" for the first decade, \"Mechanical Art\" for the 1920s, \"Aeroaesthetics\" for the 1930s.\n\nRussian Futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts. The poet Vladimir Mayakovsky was a prominent member of the movement. Visual artists such as David Burlyuk, Mikhail Larionov, Natalia Goncharova and Kazimir Malevich found inspiration in the imagery of Futurist writings and were poets themselves. It has also a larger impact on the all suprematism movement. Other poets adopting Futurism included Velimir Khlebnikov and Aleksey Kruchenykh. Poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the Futurist opera \"Victory Over the Sun\", with texts by Kruchenykh and sets by Malevich.\n\nThe main style of painting was Cubo-Futurism, adopted in 1913 when Aristarkh Lentulov returned from Paris and exhibited his paintings in Moscow. Cubo-Futurism combines the forms of Cubism with the representation of movement. Like their Italian predecessors the Russian Futurists were fascinated with dynamism, speed and the restlessness of modern urban life.\n\nThe Russian Futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past, saying that Pushkin and Dostoevsky should be \"heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity\". They acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to Marinetti, whose principles they had earlier adopted, obstructing him when he came to Russia to proselytize in 1914.\n\nThe movement began to decline after the revolution of 1917. Some Futurists died, others emigrated. Mayakovsky and Malevich became part of the Soviet establishment and the Agitprop movement of the 1920s. Khlebnikov and others were persecuted. Mayakovsky committed suicide on April 14, 1930.\n\nThe Futurist architect Antonio Sant'Elia expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for \"La Città Nuova\" (The New City) (1912–1914). This project was never built and Sant'Elia was killed in the First World War, but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artists. The city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of Futurist life is projected. The city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life. Sant'Elia aimed to create a city as an efficient, fast-paced machine. He manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects. Baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity. In the new city, every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy. The city was not meant to last, and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past.\n\nFuturist architects were sometimes at odds with the Fascist state's tendency towards Roman imperial-classical aesthetic patterns. Nevertheless, several Futurist buildings were built in the years 1920–1940, including public buildings such as railway stations, maritime resorts and post offices. Examples of Futurist buildings still in use today are Trento's railway station, built by Angiolo Mazzoni, and the Santa Maria Novella station in Florence. The Florence station was designed in 1932 by the \"Gruppo Toscano\" (Tuscan Group) of architects, which included Giovanni Michelucci and Italo Gamberini, with contributions by Mazzoni.\n\nFuturist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery, and would influence several 20th-century composers.\n\nFrancesco Balilla Pratella joined the Futurist movement in 1910 and wrote a \"Manifesto of Futurist Musicians\" in which he appealed to the young (as had Marinetti), because only they could understand what he had to say. According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the \"sublime genius\" of Wagner and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers, for example Richard Strauss, Elgar, Mussorgsky, and Sibelius. By contrast, the Italian symphony was dominated by opera in an \"absurd and anti-musical form\". The conservatories was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the \"rickety and vulgar\" operas of Puccini and Umberto Giordano. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher Pietro Mascagni, because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella's tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled \"the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice.\"\n\nLuigi Russolo (1885–1947) wrote \"The Art of Noises\" (1913), an influential text in 20th-century musical aesthetics. Russolo used instruments he called \"intonarumori\", which were acoustic noise generators that permitted the performer to create and control the dynamics and pitch of several different types of noises. Russolo and Marinetti gave the first concert of Futurist music, complete with \"intonarumori\", in 1914. However they were prevented from performing in many major European cities by the outbreak of war.\n\nFuturism was one of several 20th-century movements in art music that paid homage to, included or imitated machines. Ferruccio Busoni has been seen as anticipating some Futurist ideas, though he remained wedded to tradition. Russolo's \"intonarumori\" influenced Stravinsky, Arthur Honegger, George Antheil, Edgar Varèse, Stockhausen and John Cage. In Pacific 231, Honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive. There are also Futurist elements in Prokofiev's \"The Steel Step\" and in his Second Symphony.\n\nMost notable in this respect, however, is the American George Antheil. His fascination with machinery is evident in his \"Airplane Sonata\", \"Death of the Machines\", and the 30-minute \"Ballet Mécanique\". The \"Ballet Mécanique\" was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by Fernand Léger, but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone. The score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones, four bass drums, a tam-tam, three airplane propellers, seven electric bells, a siren, two \"live pianists\", and sixteen synchronized player pianos. Antheil's piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play.\n\nOther composers offered more melodic variants of Futurist music, notably Franco Casavola, who was active with the movement at the invitation of Marinetti between 1924 and 1927, and Arthur-Vincent Lourié, the first Russian Futurist musician, and a signatory of the St Petersburg Futurist Manifesto in 1914. His five \"Synthèses\" offer a form of dodecaphony, while \"Formes en l'air\" was dedicated to Picasso and is a Cubo-Futurist concept. Born in Ukraine and raised in New York, Leo Ornstein gave his first recital of 'Futurist Music' at the Steinway Hall in London on 27 March 1914. According to the Daily Sketch newspaper \"one listened with considerable distress. Nothing so horrible as Mr Ornstein's music has been heard so far. Sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital.\"\n\nThe Futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance. Indeed, dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing man's ultimate fusion with the machine. The altitude of a flying plane, the power of a car's motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of man's intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise. This type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional, classical dance and introduces a different style, new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience. The dancer no longer performs a story, a clear content, that can be read according to the rules of ballet. One of the most famous futuristic dancers was the Italian . Trained as a classical ballerina, she is known for her \"Aerodanze\" and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions. She describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with Marinetti and his poetry. Through these words, she explains: \" I launched this idea of the aerial-futurist poetry with Marinetti, he himself declaiming the poetry. A small stage of a few square meters;... I made myself a satin costume with a helmet; everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impression of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled... And the face had to express what the pilot felt.\"\n\nFuturism as a literary movement made its official debut with F.T. Marinetti's \"Manifesto of Futurism\" (1909), as it delineated the various ideals Futurist poetry should strive for. Poetry, the predominate medium of Futurist literature, can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem). The Futurists called their style of poetry \"parole in libertà\" (word autonomy) in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.\n\nTheater also has an important place within the Futurist universe. Works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long, have an emphasis on nonsensical humor, and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques.\nThere are a number of examples of Futurist novels from both the initial period of Futurism and the neo-Futurist period, from Marinetti himself to a number of lesser known Futurists, such as Primo Conti, Ardengo Soffici and Giordano Bruno Sanzin (\"Zig Zag, Il Romanzo Futurista\" edited by Alessandro Masi, 1995). They are very diverse in style, with very little recourse to the characteristics of Futurist Poetry, such as 'parole in libertà'. Arnaldo Ginna's 'Le \"locomotive con le calze\"'(Trains with socks on)plunges into a world of absurd nonsense, childishly crude. His brother Bruno Corra wrote in \"Sam Dunn è morto\" (Sam Dunn is Dead) a masterpiece of Futurist fiction, in a genre he himself called 'Synthetic' characterized by compression, and precision; it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony.\n\nWhen interviewed about her favorite film of all times, famed movie critic Pauline Kael stated that the director Dimitri Kirsanoff, in his silent experimental film \"Ménilmontant\" \"developed a technique that suggests the movement known in painting as Futurism\".\n\nMany Italian Futurists supported Fascism in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural, archaic South. Like the Fascists, the Futurists were Italian nationalists, radicals, admirers of violence, and were opposed to parliamentary democracy. Marinetti founded the Futurist Political Party (\"Partito Politico Futurista\") in early 1918, which was absorbed into Benito Mussolini's \"Fasci di combattimento\" in 1919, making Marinetti one of the first members of the National Fascist Party. He opposed Fascism's later exaltation of existing institutions, calling them \"reactionary\", and walked out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrawing from politics for three years; but he supported Italian Fascism until his death in 1944. The Futurists' association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work, especially in architecture. After the Second World War, many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime.\n\nMarinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Fascist Italy but failed to do so. Mussolini chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the Novecento Italiano group in 1923, he said, \"I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art. Art belongs to the domain of the individual. The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view.\" Mussolini's mistress, Margherita Sarfatti, who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as Marinetti, successfully promoted the rival Novecento group, and even persuaded Marinetti to sit on its board. Although in the early years of Italian Fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced, towards the end of the 1930s, right-wing Fascists introduced the concept of \"degenerate art\" from Germany to Italy and condemned Futurism.\n\nMarinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime, becoming less radical and avant-garde with each. He moved from Milan to Rome to be nearer the centre of things. He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies, married despite his condemnation of marriage, promoted religious art after the Lateran Treaty of 1929 and even reconciled himself to the Catholic Church, declaring that Jesus was a Futurist.\nAlthough Futurism mostly became identified with Fascism, it had leftist and anti-Fascist supporters. They tended to oppose Marinetti's artistic and political direction of the movement, and in 1924 the socialists, communists and anarchists walked out of the Milan Futurist Congress. The anti-Fascist voices in Futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of Abyssinia and the Italo-German Pact of Steel in 1939. This association of Fascists, socialists and anarchists in the Futurist movement, which may seem odd today, can be understood in terms of the influence of Georges Sorel, whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum.\n\nFuturism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, theatre design, textiles, drama, literature, music and architecture.\n\nAeropainting (\"aeropittura\") was a major expression of the second generation of Futurism beginning in 1926. The technology and excitement of flight, directly experienced by most aeropainters, offered aeroplanes and aerial landscape as new subject matter. Aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment, including realism (especially in works of propaganda), abstraction, dynamism, quiet Umbrian landscapes, portraits of Mussolini (e.g. Dottori's \"Portrait of il Duce\"), devotional religious paintings, decorative art, and pictures of planes.\n\nAeropainting was launched in a manifesto of 1929, \"Perspectives of Flight\", signed by Benedetta, Depero, Dottori, Fillìa, Marinetti, Prampolini, Somenzi and . The artists stated that \"The changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective\" and that \"Painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything.\" Crispolti identifies three main \"positions\" in aeropainting: \"a vision of cosmic projection, at its most typical in Prampolini's 'cosmic idealism' ... ; a 'reverie' of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairy-tale (for example in Dottori ...); and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery (particularly in Crali, but also in Tato and Ambrosi).\"\n\nEventually there were over a hundred aeropainters. Major figures include Fortunato Depero, Enrico Prampolini, Gerardo Dottori and Crali. Crali continued to produce \"aeropittura\" up until the 1980s.\n\nFuturism influenced many other twentieth-century art movements, including Art Deco, Vorticism, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and much later Neo-Futurism. Futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct, having died out in 1944 with the death of its leader Marinetti.\n\nNonetheless, the ideals of Futurism remain as significant components of modern Western culture; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture. Ridley Scott consciously evoked the designs of Sant'Elia in \"Blade Runner\". Echoes of Marinetti's thought, especially his \"dreamt-of metallization of the human body\", are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture, and surface in manga/anime and the works of artists such as Shinya Tsukamoto, director of the \"Tetsuo\" (lit. \"Ironman\") films. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the literary genre of cyberpunk—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the Internet, such as Stelarc and Mariko Mori, produce work which comments on Futurist ideals. and the art and architecture movement Neo-Futurism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values.\n\nA revival of sorts of the Futurist movement in theatre began in 1988 with the creation of the Neo-Futurist style in Chicago, which utilizes Futurism's focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre. Currently, there are active Neo-Futurist troupes in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, and Montreal.\n\nFuturist ideas have been discerned in Western dance music since the 1980s.\n\nJapanese Composer Ryuichi Sakamoto's 1986 album 'Futurista' was inspired by the movement. It features a speech from Tommaso Marinetti in the track 'Variety Show'.\n\nIn 2009, Italian director Marco Bellocchio included Futurist art in his feature film \"Vincere\".\n\nIn 2014, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum featured the exhibition \"Italian Futurism, 1909–1944: Reconstructing the Universe\". This was the first comprehensive overview of Italian Futurism to be presented in the United States.\n\nEstorick Collection of Modern Italian Art is a museum in London with a collection centered around Italian futurist artists and their paintings.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "185803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185803", "title": "Gullah language", "text": "Gullah language\n\nGullah, also called Sea Island Creole English and Geechee, is a creole language spoken by the Gullah people (also called \"Geechees\" within the community), an African-American population living in coastal regions of the American states of South Carolina and Georgia (including urban Charleston and Savannah), as well as northeasternmost Florida. Closely related varieties are spoken in the Bahamas, namely Bahamian Creole.\n\nThe Gullah language is based on different varieties of English and languages of West and Central Africa.\n\nScholars have proposed a number of theories about the origins of Gullah and its development:\n\nThe vocabulary of Gullah comes primarily from English, but there are numerous words of African origin for which scholars have yet to produce detailed etymologies. Some of these African loanwords are: \"cootuh\" (\"turtle\"), \"oonuh\" (\"you [plural]\"), \"nyam\" (\"eat\"), \"buckruh\" (\"white man\"), \"pojo\" (\"heron\"), \"swonguh\" (\"proud\") and \"benne\" (\"sesame\").\n\nGullah resembles other English-based creole languages spoken in West Africa and the Caribbean Basin. These include the Krio language of Sierra Leone, Jamaican Patois, Bajan Creole, Trinidadian Creole, Tobagonian Creole, Guyanese Creole, and Belizean Kriol. It is speculated that these languages use English as a lexifier (i.e., their vocabularies are derived largely from English), and that their syntax (sentence structure) is strongly influenced by African languages; but research by Salikoko Mufwene and others suggests that non-standard Englishes may have also influenced Gullah's (and other creoles') syntactical features.\n\nGullah is most closely related to Afro-Seminole Creole, spoken in scattered Black Seminole communities in Oklahoma, Texas, and Northern Mexico. The Black Seminoles' ancestors were Gullahs who escaped from slavery in coastal South Carolina and Georgia in the 18th and 19th centuries and fled into the Florida wilderness. They emigrated from Florida after the Second Seminole War (1835–42). Their modern descendants in the West speak a conservative form of Gullah resembling the language of 19th-century plantation slaves.\n\nThere is debate amongst linguists concerning the relationship between Gullah and African-American English (AAE). There are some that postulate a Gullah-like \"plantation creole\" as having been the origin of AAE. Others cite different British dialects of English as having had greater influence on the structure of AAE.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s the African-American linguist Lorenzo Dow Turner did a seminal study of the Gullah language based on field research in rural communities in coastal South Carolina and Georgia. Turner found that Gullah is strongly influenced by African languages in its sound system, vocabulary, grammar, sentence structure, and semantics. Turner identified over 300 loanwords from various African languages in Gullah and almost 4,000 African personal names used by Gullah people. He also found Gullahs living in remote seaside settlements who could recite songs and story fragments and do simple counting in the Mende, Vai and Fulani languages of West Africa.\n\nIn 1949, Turner published his findings in a classic work called \"Africanisms in the Gullah Dialect\" (). The fourth edition of this book was reprinted with a new introduction in 2002.\n\nBefore Turner's work, mainstream scholars viewed Gullah speech as substandard English, a hodgepodge of mispronounced words and corrupted grammar, which uneducated black people developed in their efforts to copy the speech of their English, Irish, Scottish and French Huguenot slave owners.\n\nTurner's study was so well researched and detailed in its evidence of African influences in Gullah that academics soon changed their minds. After Turner's book was published in 1949, scholars began coming to the Gullah region regularly to study African influences in Gullah language and culture.\n\nThe following sentences illustrate the basic verb tense and aspect system in Gullah:\n\nThese sentences illustrate 19th-century Gullah speech:\n\nThe Gullah people have a rich storytelling tradition strongly influenced by African oral traditions but also by their historical experience in America. Their stories include animal trickster tales about the antics of \"Brer Rabbit\", \"Brer Fox\" and \"Brer Bear\", \"Brer Wolf\", etc.; human trickster tales about clever and self-assertive slaves; and morality tales designed to impart moral teaching to children.\n\nSeveral white American writers collected Gullah stories in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The best collections were made by Charles Colcock Jones, Jr. from Georgia and Albert Henry Stoddard from South Carolina. Jones (a Confederate officer during the Civil War) and Stoddard were both planter-class whites who grew up speaking Gullah with the slaves (and later, freedmen) on their families' plantations. Another collection was made by Abigail Christensen, a Northern woman whose parents came to the Lowcountry after the Civil War to assist the newly freed slaves. Ambrose E. Gonzales, another writer of South Carolina planter-class background, also wrote original stories in 19th-century Gullah, based on Gullah literary forms. Gonzales' works are well remembered in South Carolina today.\n\nThe linguistic accuracy of these writings has been questioned because of the authors' social backgrounds. Nonetheless, these works provide the best available information on the Gullah language as it was spoken in its more conservative form during the 19th century.\n\nGullah is spoken by about 250,000 people in coastal South Carolina and Georgia. Although some scholars argue that Gullah has changed little since the 19th century and that most speakers have always been bilingual, it is likely that at least some decreolization has taken place. In other words, some African-influenced grammatical structures that were present a century ago are less prevalent in the language today. Nonetheless, Gullah is still understood as a creole language and is certainly distinct from Standard American English.\n\nFor generations, outsiders stigmatized Gullah speakers, by regarding their language as a mark of ignorance and low social status. As a result, Gullah people developed the habit of speaking their language only within the confines of their own homes and local communities. That causes difficulty in enumerating speakers and assessing decreolization. It was not used in public situations outside the safety of their home areas, and many speakers experienced discrimination even within the Gullah community. Some speculate that the prejudice of outsiders may have helped to maintain the language. Others suggest that a kind of valorization or \"covert prestige\" remained for many community members and that the complex pride has insulated the language from obliteration.\n\nUS Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was raised as a Gullah speaker in coastal Georgia. When asked why he has little to say during hearings of the court, he told a high school student that the ridicule he received for his Gullah speech, as a young man, caused him to develop the habit of listening rather than speaking in public.

As there are often several generations of copies between an extant copy of an ancient text and the original, each handwritten by different scribes, there is a natural tendency for extraneous material to be inserted into such documents over time.\n\nInterpolations originally may be inserted as an authentic explanatory note (for example, ), but may also be included for fraudulent purposes. The forged passages and works attributed to the Pseudo-Isidore are an example of the latter. Similarly, the letters of Ignatius of Antioch were interpolated by Apollinarian heretics, three centuries after the originals were written. Charters and legal texts are also subject to forgery of this kind. In the 13th century a medieval romance, the \"Prose Tristan\", inserted another prose romance, the Vulgate \"Queste del Saint Graal\", in its entirety in order to reinterpret the Quest for the Holy Grail through the optics of the Tristan story. \n\nHowever, most interpolations result from the errors and inaccuracies which tend to arise during hand-copying, especially over long periods of time. For example, if a scribe made an error when copying a text and omitted some lines, he would have tended to include the omitted material in the margin. However, margin notes made by readers are present in almost all manuscripts. Therefore, a different scribe seeking to produce a copy of the manuscript perhaps many years later could find it very difficult to determine whether a margin note was an omission made by the previous scribe (which should be included in the text) or simply a note made by a reader (which should be ignored or kept in the margin).\n\nConscientious scribes tended to copy everything which appeared in a manuscript, but in all cases scribes needed to exercise personal judgement. Explanatory notes would tend to find their way into the body of a text as a natural result of this subjective process.\n\nModern scholars have developed techniques for recognizing interpolation, which are often apparent to modern observers, but would have been less so for medieval copyists.\n\nThe Comma Johanneum, for example, is commonly regarded as interpolation. The specific problem of Christian transmission of Jewish texts outside the Jewish and Christian canons is often described as Christian interpolation.\n\n"}

{"id": "169549", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169549", "title": "Milli Vanilli", "text": "Milli Vanilli\n\nMilli Vanilli was a German R&B duo from Munich. The group was founded by Frank Farian in 1988 and consisted of Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus. The group's debut album, titled \"All or Nothing\" in Europe and reconfigured as \"Girl You Know It's True\" in the United States, achieved international success and earned them a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on 21 February 1990.\n\nMilli Vanilli became one of the most popular pop acts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with millions of records sold. However, their success quickly turned to infamy when Morvan, Pilatus, and their agent Sergio Vendero confessed that Morvan and Pilatus did not sing any of the vocals heard on their music releases. The duo ended up giving back the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. The group recorded a comeback album in 1998 titled \"Back and in Attack\", but the album was shelved after Rob Pilatus died at the age of 32.\n\nAccording to VH1's \"Behind the Music\", the single \"Girl You Know It's True\" was first produced by Jesse Powell and had already been completed before Rob Pilatus and Fab Morvan were recruited. Frank Farian felt that no efforts should be made to refine Pilatus and Morvan's voices. \n\nMorvan claimed in 2011 that Farian had manipulated the two of them by giving them a small advance when he signed them. The pair spent most of it on clothes and hairstyling. Several months later, Farian called them and told them they had to lip sync to some prerecorded music or, as stated in the contract, repay the advance in full. \"We were not hired, we were trapped,\" Morvan recalled.\n\nBeth McCarthy-Miller, then an executive with MTV, says the duo's poor English language skills, when they came in for their first interview with the channel, stirred doubts among those present as to whether they had sung on their records. The first public sign that the group was lip-syncing came on 21 July 1989, during a live performance on MTV at the Lake Compounce theme park in Bristol, Connecticut. As they performed, the recording of the song \"Girl You Know It's True\" jammed and began to skip, repeatedly playing the partial line \"Girl, you know it's...\" through the speakers. They continued to pretend to sing and dance onstage for a few more moments, then they both ran offstage. According to the episode of VH1's \"Behind the Music\" which profiled Milli Vanilli, Downtown Julie Brown stated that fans attending the concert seemed neither to care, nor even to notice, and the concert continued as if nothing unusual had happened. In a March 1990 issue of \"Time\" magazine, Pilatus was quoted proclaiming himself to be \"the new Elvis\", reasoning that by the duo's success they were more talented musically than Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger. This has been refuted by Fab Morvan, as recently as 2017, stating that Rob never said those words and that the quote was taken out of context likely due to Rob still not having a full grasp of the English language.\n\nUnlike the international release of \"All or Nothing\", the inserts for the American version of the album explicitly attributed the vocals to Morvan and Pilatus. This prompted singer Charles Shaw to reveal in December 1989 that he was one of the three actual singers on the album and that Pilatus and Morvan were impostors. Farian reportedly paid Shaw $150,000 to retract his statements, though this did not stem the tide of public criticism. Because of growing public questions as to who sang in the group, as well as Morvan and Pilatus' demand to Farian that they be allowed to sing on the next album, Farian confessed to reporters on 12 November 1990 that Morvan and Pilatus did not sing on the records. Having no intention of living a lie, Morvan and Pilatus stated their willingness to return their Grammy Award, which they ended up doing soon afterwards. However, their three American Music Awards were never returned and remain to this day in Frank Farian's possession.\n\nAfter these details emerged, at least 27 different lawsuits were filed under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws against Pilatus, Morvan and Arista Records. One such filing occurred on 22 November 1990, in Ohio, where lawyers filed a class-action lawsuit asking for refunds on behalf of a local woman in Cuyahoga County, who had bought \"Girl You Know It's True\". At the time the lawsuit was filed, it was estimated at least 1,000 Ohio residents had bought the album. On 12 August 1991, a proposed settlement of a refund lawsuit in Chicago, Illinois, was rejected. This settlement would have refunded buyers of Milli Vanilli CDs, cassettes, records, or singles. However, the refunds would only be given as a credit for a future Arista release. On 28 August, a new settlement was approved; it refunded those who attended concerts along with those who bought Milli Vanilli recordings. An estimated 10 million buyers were eligible to claim a refund and they could keep the refunded recordings as well. The deadline to claim refunds passed on 8 March 1992.\n\nThe resulting album, released in Europe in early 1991, was renamed \"The Moment of Truth\" and spawned three singles, \"Keep On Running\", \"Nice 'n Easy\" and \"Too Late (True Love)\". A Morvan/Pilatus lookalike named Ray Horton was depicted on the cover along with the real singers: Brad Howell and John Davis. In addition, the album featured rappers Icy Bro on \"Hard as Hell\" and Tammy T on \"Too Late (True Love)\". Original members and vocalists Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco remained on 95% of the tracks. One of four Diane Warren-penned songs that are included on \"The Moment of Truth\", \"When I Die\", has been covered by several other artists, including Farian's No Mercy. For the American market, Farian chose to avoid any association with Milli Vanilli and had the tracks re-recorded with Ray Horton on the majority of lead vocals. However, \"The Moment of Truth\" was never released in that format in the USA.\n\nIn 1992, RCA signed on to release the album as the debut of the newly created group Try 'N' B. The self-titled release included three additional tracks not on the Real Milli Vanilli release: \"Ding Dong\", \"Who Do You Love\", and a remake of Dr. Hook's \"Sexy Eyes\", and featured original Milli Vanilli vocalists Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco. Because of significantly better sales under the name Try 'N' B in America, a slightly modified Try 'N' B debut album was released internationally. It featured guest singer Tracy Ganser, a Ray Horton lookalike named Kevin Weatherspoon, as well as Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco.\n\nMorvan and Pilatus moved to Los Angeles, California, and signed with the Joss Entertainment Group. Sandy Gallin was their manager. They recorded their follow-up album under the name \"Rob & Fab\" which was financed by Taj Records in 1992 and released by Joss Entertainment in 1993. Almost all the songs on the album were written by Kenny Taylor and Fab Morvan, while Morvan and Pilatus provided the lead vocals. Werner Schüler, a German bassist and songwriter, was their producer. Because of financial constraints, Joss Entertainment Group was only able to release the album in the United States, the priority market to Milli Vanilli. A single, \"We Can Get It On\", was made available for radio play shortly before the album's release. However, the lack of publicity, poor distribution, and their steep fall from the height of pop-culture visibility after the lip-synching scandal contributed to its failure. The album only sold around 2,000 copies.\n\nIn order to restore their career, Farian agreed to produce a new Milli Vanilli album with Morvan and Pilatus on lead vocals in 1997. This led up to the recording of the 1998 Milli Vanilli comeback album \"Back and In Attack\". Even some of the original studio singers backed the performers in their attempt to bring back some of the fame that had been shed so quickly. However, Rob Pilatus encountered a number of personal problems during the production of the new album. He turned to drugs and crime, committing a series of assaults and robberies, and was ultimately sentenced to three months in jail and six months in a drug rehabilitation facility in California. Farian bailed Pilatus out of jail and paid for the rehab and plane tickets for him to fly back to Germany. On the eve of the new album's promotional tour on 2 April 1998, Pilatus was found dead of a suspected alcohol and prescription drug overdose in a Frankfurt, Germany hotel room. Pilatus' death was ruled accidental.\n\nAs a result \"Back and In Attack\" remains unreleased and the tour was cancelled. The recordings are assumed to have been destroyed.\n\nMorvan spent the following years as a session musician and public speaker while working on his musical abilities. In 1998, he was a DJ at famed L.A. radio station KIIS-FM. During this period he also performed at the station's sold-out 1999 Wango Tango festival concert before 50,000 people at Dodger Stadium. Morvan then spent 2001 on tour before performing in 2002 as the inaugural performer at the brand-new Velvet Lounge at the Hard Rock Hotel in Orlando, Florida. In 2003, Morvan released his first solo album, \"Love Revolution\". He marketed the album through his website and CD Baby.\n\nIn April 2011, Morvan released the single \"Anytime\" on iTunes.\n\nIn 1991, Pilatus and Morvan appeared in a commercial for Carefree Sugarless Gum, which parodied their lip-syncing fiasco. They also appeared in an episode of the Super Mario Bros. cartoon and even signed with a PR firm in hopes of breaking into acting. As they told the \"L.A. Times\", \"We think we have the potential to become actors. After all, we got a lot of practice while we were in Milli Vanilli. But the most important thing to us now is the new album.\" \n\nThe duo was featured (and interviewed) for the premiere episode of VH1 \"Behind the Music\" in 1997.\n\nIn 2000, Fab Morvan was featured in a BBC documentary titled \"It Takes Two: The Story of the Pop Duo\" about musical duos.\n\nOn 14 February 2007, it was announced that Universal Pictures was developing a film based on the story of Milli Vanilli's rise and fall in the music industry. Jeff Nathanson, screenwriter for \"Catch Me If You Can\", producers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall, and producer executive Adam Yoelin, were supposed to write and direct the film while Fab Morvan served as a consultant. However, in February 2011, it was announced the Milli Vanilli movie would be rewritten and directed by Florian Gallenberger. \nThe documentary \"Milli Vanilli: From Fame to Shame\" was eventually directed by German Oliver Schwehm, and produced by Hannah Lenitzki from Bremedia Produktion, released in 2016.\n\nIn January 2014, the actual Milli Vanilli singers — Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco, John Davis and Brad Howell — filmed an in-depth interview with the producers of \"Oprah: Where Are They Now\" for OWN TV. The show aired in the US on Friday, 21 February 2014. \n\nIn 2015 TMZ reported that Fab Morvan was working on an album with John Davis, one of the original Milli Vanilli singers, called \"Face Meets Voice\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "517387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=517387", "title": "Nevalı Çori", "text": "Nevalı Çori\n\nNevalı Çori () was an early Neolithic settlement on the middle Euphrates, in Şanlıurfa Province, Southeastern Anatolia, Turkey. The site is known for having some of the world's oldest known temples and monumental sculpture. Together with the earlier site of Göbekli Tepe, it has revolutionised scientific understanding of the Eurasian Neolithic period. The oldest domesticated Einkorn wheat was found there.\n\nThe settlement was located about 490 m above sea level, in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, on both banks of the Kantara stream, a tributary of the Euphrates.\n\nThe site was examined from 1983 to 1991 in the context of rescue excavations during the erection of the Atatürk Dam below Samsat. Excavations were conducted by a team from the University of Heidelberg under the direction of Professor Harald Hauptmann. Together with numerous other archaeological sites in the vicinity, Nevalı Çori has since been inundated by the damming of the Euphrates.\n\nNevalı Çori could be placed within the local relative chronology on the basis of its flint tools. The occurrence of narrow unretouched Byblos-type points places it on Oliver Aurenche's Phase 3, i.e. early to middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). Some tools indicate continuity into Phase 4, which is similar in date to Late PPNB. An even finer chronological distinction within Phase 3 is permitted by the settlement's architecture; the house type with underfloor channels, typical of Nevalı Çori strata I-IV, also characterises the \"Intermediate Layer\" at Çayönü, while the differing plan of the single building in stratum V, House 1, is more clearly connected to the buildings of the \"Cellular Plan Layer\" at Çayönü.\n\nIn terms of absolute dates, four radiocarbon dates have been determined for Nevalı Çori. Three are from Stratum II and date it with some certainty to the second half of the 9th millennium BC, which coincides with early dates from Çayönü and with Mureybet IVA and thus supports the relative chronology above. The fourth dates to the 10th millennium BC, which, if correct, would indicate the presence of an extremely early phase of PPNB at Nevalı Çori.\n\nThe settlement had five architectural levels. The excavated architectural remains were of long rectangular houses containing two to three parallel flights of rooms, interpreted as mezzanines. These are adjacent to a similarly rectangular ante-structure, subdivided by wall projections, which should be seen as a residential space. This type of house is characterized by thick, multi-layered foundations made of large angular cobbles and boulders, the gaps filled with smaller stones so as to provide a relatively even surface to support the superstructure. These foundations are interrupted every 1-1.5m by underfloor channels, at right angles to the main axis of the houses, which were covered in stone slabs but open to the sides. They may have served the drainage, aeration or the cooling of the houses. 23 such structures were excavated, they are strikingly similar to structures from the so-called channeled subphase at Çayönü.\n\nAn area in the northwest part of the village appears to be of special importance. Here, a cult complex had been cut into the hillside. It had three subsequent architectural phases, the most recent belonging to Stratum III, the middle one to Stratum II and the oldest to Stratum I. The two more recent phases also possessed a terrazzo-style lime cement floor, which did not survive from the oldest phase. Parallels are known from Cayönü and Göbekli Tepe. Monolithic pillars similar to those at Göbekli Tepe were built into its dry stone walls, its interior contained two free-standing pillars of 3 m height. The excavator assumes light flat roofs. Similar structures are only known from Göbekli Tepe so far.\n\nSoundings cut to examine the western side of the valley also revealed rectilinear architecture in 2-3 layers.\n\nThe local limestone was carved into numerous statues and smaller sculptures, including a more than life-sized bare human head with a snake or sikha-like tuft. There is also a statue of a bird. Some of the pillars also bore reliefs, including ones of human hands. The free-standing anthropomorphic figures of limestone excavated at Nevalı Çori belong to the earliest known life-size sculptures. Comparable material has been found at Göbekli Tepe.\n\nSeveral hundred small clay figurines (about 5 cm high), most of them depicting humans, have been interpreted as votive offerings. They were fired at temperatures between 500-600 °C, which suggests the development of ceramic firing technology before the advent of pottery proper.\n\nA bas relief on a fragment of a limestone bowl depicts two humans and one tortoise-like creature dancing.\n\nSome of the houses contained depositions of human skulls and incomplete skeletons.\n\n\n"}

In the early 19th century, it was split and partially dispersed, and some of the predella panels were acquired by the Pinacoteca Vaticana. In Perugia were executed copies of these panels, enclosed into a neo-Gothic frame. The polyptych also included some small depictions of saints, on the side piers, and two tondoes with the \"Annunciation Angel\" and the \"Annunciation\", in the cusps.\n\nThe work includes a large central panel, depicting the \"Madonna Enthroned with Child and Angels\", which was fully painted by Fra Angelico. The two side panels, each forming two arched sub-panels and including a figure of saint. On the left are St. Dominic and St. Nicholas, attributed to Angelico, while on the right are St. John the Baptist and St. Catherine of Alexandria, considered mostly by his workshop. \n\nThe central Madonna is a \"Maestà\" depiction, and sits on a large throne painted using geometric perspective. In front of her is a step with vases housing three white and red roses (symbolizing of the Virgin's purity and a forecast of Christ's Passion, respectively).

{"id": "2958015", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2958015", "title": "Philosophy of artificial intelligence", "text": "Philosophy of artificial intelligence\n\nArtificial intelligence has close connections with philosophy because both share several concepts and these include intelligence, action, consciousness, epistemology, and even free will. Furthermore, the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people (or, at least, artificial creatures) so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers. These factors contributed to the emergence of the philosophy of artificial intelligence. Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental.\n\nThe philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows:\n\nThese three questions reflect the divergent interests of AI researchers, linguists, cognitive scientists and philosophers respectively. The scientific answers to these questions depend on the definition of \"intelligence\" and \"consciousness\" and exactly which \"machines\" are under discussion.\n\nImportant propositions in the philosophy of AI include:\n\n\nIs it possible to create a machine that can solve \"all\" the problems humans solve using their intelligence? This question defines the scope of what machines will be able to do in the future and guides the direction of AI research. It only concerns the \"behavior\" of machines and ignores the issues of interest to psychologists, cognitive scientists and philosophers; to answer this question, it does not matter whether a machine is \"really\" thinking (as a person thinks) or is just \"acting like\" it is thinking.\n\nThe basic position of most AI researchers is summed up in this statement, which appeared in the proposal for the Dartmouth workshop of 1956:\nArguments against the basic premise must show that building a working AI system is impossible, because there is some practical limit to the abilities of computers or that there is some special quality of the human mind that is necessary for thinking and yet cannot be duplicated by a machine (or by the methods of current AI research). Arguments in favor of the basic premise must show that such a system is possible.\n\nThe first step to answering the question is to clearly define \"intelligence\".\n\nAlan Turing reduced the problem of defining intelligence to a simple question about conversation. He suggests that: if a machine can answer \"any\" question put to it, using the same words that an ordinary person would, then we may call that machine intelligent. A modern version of his experimental design would use an online chat room, where one of the participants is a real person and one of the participants is a computer program. The program passes the test if no one can tell which of the two participants is human. Turing notes that no one (except philosophers) ever asks the question \"can people think?\" He writes \"instead of arguing continually over this point, it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks\". Turing's test extends this polite convention to machines:\nOne criticism of the Turing test is that it is explicitly anthropomorphic . If our ultimate goal is to create machines that are \"more\" intelligent than people, why should we insist that our machines must closely \"resemble\" people? Russell and Norvig write that \"aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as 'making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons'\".\n\nRecent A.I. research defines intelligence in terms of intelligent agents. An \"agent\" is something which perceives and acts in an environment. A \"performance measure\" defines what counts as success for the agent. \nDefinitions like this one try to capture the essence of intelligence. They have the advantage that, unlike the Turing test, they do not also test for human traits that we may not want to consider intelligent, like the ability to be insulted or the temptation to lie . They have the disadvantage that they fail to make the commonsense differentiation between \"things that think\" and \"things that do not\". By this definition, even a thermostat has a rudimentary intelligence.\n\nHubert Dreyfus describes this argument as claiming that \"if the nervous system obeys the laws of physics and chemistry, which we have every reason to suppose it does, then ... we ... ought to be able to reproduce the behavior of the nervous system with some physical device\". This argument, first introduced as early as 1943 and vividly described by Hans Moravec in 1988, is now associated with futurist Ray Kurzweil, who estimates that computer power will be sufficient for a complete brain simulation by the year 2029. A non-real-time simulation of a thalamocortical model that has the size of the human brain (10 neurons) was performed in 2005 and it took 50 days to simulate 1 second of brain dynamics on a cluster of 27 processors.\n\nFew disagree that a brain simulation is possible in theory, even critics of AI such as Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle.\nHowever, Searle points out that, in principle, \"anything\" can be simulated by a computer; thus, bringing the definition to its breaking point leads to the conclusion that any process at all can technically be considered \"computation\". \"What we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers,\" he writes. Thus, merely mimicking the functioning of a brain would in itself be an admission of ignorance regarding intelligence and the nature of the mind .\nIn 1963, Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon proposed that \"symbol manipulation\" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence. They wrote: \nThis claim is very strong: it implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is \"necessary\" for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is \"sufficient\" for intelligence). Another version of this position was described by philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who called it \"the psychological assumption\":\nA distinction is usually made between the kind of high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world, such as <nowiki><dog></nowiki> and <nowiki><tail></nowiki> and the more complex \"symbols\" that are present in a machine like a neural network. Early research into AI, called \"good old fashioned artificial intelligence\" (GOFAI) by John Haugeland, focused on these kind of high level symbols.\n\nThese arguments show that human thinking does not consist (solely) of high level symbol manipulation. They do \"not\" show that artificial intelligence is impossible, only that more than symbol processing is required.\n\nIn 1931, Kurt Gödel proved with an incompleteness theorem that it is always possible to construct a \"Gödel statement\" that a given consistent formal system of logic (such as a high-level symbol manipulation program) could not prove. Despite being a true statement, the constructed Gödel statement is unprovable in the given system. (The truth of the constructed Gödel statement is contingent on the consistency of the given system; applying the same process to a subtly inconsistent system will appear to succeed, but will actually yield a false \"Gödel statement\" instead.) More speculatively, Gödel conjectured that the human mind can correctly eventually determine the truth or falsity of any well-grounded mathematical statement (including any possible Gödel statement), and that therefore the human mind's power is not reducible to a \"mechanism\". Philosopher John Lucas (since 1961) and Roger Penrose (since 1989) have championed this philosophical anti-mechanist argument. Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments tend to rely on the innocuous-seeming claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent (completely free of error) and believes fully in its own consistency (and can make all logical inferences that follow from its own consistency, including belief in its Gödel statement) . This is provably impossible for a Turing machine (and, by an informal extension, any known type of mechanical computer) to do; therefore, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning is too powerful to be captured in a machine .\n\nHowever, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent \"idealized version\" \"H\" of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of \"H\" (otherwise \"H\" is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument that humans have mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond what a machine could ever duplicate. This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in \"Artificial Intelligence\": \"\"any\" attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the computationalist thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis.\"\n\nMore pragmatically, Russell and Norvig note that Gödel's argument only applies to what can theoretically be proved, given an infinite amount of memory and time. In practice, real machines (including humans) have finite resources and will have difficulty proving many theorems. It is not necessary to prove everything in order to be intelligent .\n\nLess formally, Douglas Hofstadter, in his Pulitzer prize winning book \",\" states that these \"Gödel-statements\" always refer to the system itself, drawing an analogy to the way the Epimenides paradox uses statements that refer to themselves, such as \"this statement is false\" or \"I am lying\". But, of course, the Epimenides paradox applies to anything that makes statements, whether they are machines \"or\" humans, even Lucas himself. Consider:\nThis statement is true but cannot be asserted by Lucas. This shows that Lucas himself is subject to the same limits that he describes for machines, as are all people, and so Lucas's argument is pointless.\n\nAfter concluding that human reasoning is non-computable, Penrose went on to controversially speculate that some kind of hypothetical non-computable processes involving the collapse of quantum mechanical states give humans a special advantage over existing computers. Existing quantum computers are only capable of reducing the complexity of Turing computable tasks and are still restricted to tasks within the scope of Turing machines. . By Penrose and Lucas's arguments, existing quantum computers are not sufficient , so Penrose seeks for some other process involving new physics, for instance quantum gravity which might manifest new physics at the scale of the Planck mass via spontaneous quantum collapse of the wave function. These states, he suggested, occur both within neurons and also spanning more than one neuron. However, other scientists point out that there is no plausible organic mechanism in the brain for harnessing any sort of quantum computation, and furthermore that the timescale of quantum decoherence seems too fast to influence neuron firing.\n\nHubert Dreyfus Hubert Dreyfus's views on artificial intelligence and expertise depended primarily on implicit skill rather than explicit symbolic manipulation, and argued that these skills would never be captured in formal rules.\n\nDreyfus's argument had been anticipated by Turing in his 1950 paper Computing machinery and intelligence, where he had classified this as the \"argument from the informality of behavior.\" Turing argued in response that, just because we do not know the rules that govern a complex behavior, this does not mean that no such rules exist. He wrote: \"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'\"\n\nRussell and Norvig point out that, in the years since Dreyfus published his critique, progress has been made towards discovering the \"rules\" that govern unconscious reasoning. The situated movement in robotics research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention. Computational intelligence paradigms, such as neural nets, evolutionary algorithms and so on are mostly directed at simulated unconscious reasoning and learning. Statistical approaches to AI can make predictions which approach the accuracy of human intuitive guesses. Research into commonsense knowledge has focused on reproducing the \"background\" or context of knowledge. In fact, AI research in general has moved away from high level symbol manipulation or \"GOFAI\", towards new models that are intended to capture more of our \"unconscious\" reasoning . Historian and AI researcher Daniel Crevier wrote that \"time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier.\"\n\nThis is a philosophical question, related to the problem of other minds and the hard problem of consciousness. The question revolves around a position defined by John Searle as \"strong AI\":\nSearle distinguished this position from what he called \"weak AI\":\nSearle introduced the terms to isolate strong AI from weak AI so he could focus on what he thought was the more interesting and debatable issue. He argued that \"even if we assume\" that we had a computer program that acted exactly like a human mind, there would still be a difficult philosophical question that needed to be answered.\n\nNeither of Searle's two positions are of great concern to AI research, since they do not directly answer the question \"can a machine display general intelligence?\" (unless it can also be shown that consciousness is \"necessary\" for intelligence). Turing wrote \"I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness… [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think].\" Russell and Norvig agree: \"Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis.\"\n\nThere are a few researchers who believe that consciousness is an essential element in intelligence, such as Igor Aleksander, Stan Franklin, Ron Sun, and Pentti Haikonen, although their definition of \"consciousness\" strays very close to \"intelligence.\" (See artificial consciousness.)\n\nBefore we can answer this question, we must be clear what we mean by \"minds\", \"mental states\" and \"consciousness\".\n\nThe words \"mind\" and \"consciousness\" are used by different communities in different ways. Some new age thinkers, for example, use the word \"consciousness\" to describe something similar to Bergson's \"élan vital\": an invisible, energetic fluid that permeates life and especially the mind. Science fiction writers use the word to describe some essential property that makes us human: a machine or alien that is \"conscious\" will be presented as a fully human character, with intelligence, desires, will, insight, pride and so on. (Science fiction writers also use the words \"sentience\", \"sapience,\" \"self-awareness\" or \"ghost\" - as in the \"Ghost in the Shell\" manga and anime series - to describe this essential human property). For others , the words \"mind\" or \"consciousness\" are used as a kind of secular synonym for the soul.\n\nFor philosophers, neuroscientists and cognitive scientists, the words are used in a way that is both more precise and more mundane: they refer to the familiar, everyday experience of having a \"thought in your head\", like a perception, a dream, an intention or a plan, and to the way we \"know\" something, or \"mean\" something or \"understand\" something . \"It's not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness\" observes philosopher John Searle. What is mysterious and fascinating is not so much \"what\" it is but \"how\" it is: how does a lump of fatty tissue and electricity give rise to this (familiar) experience of perceiving, meaning or thinking?\n\nPhilosophers call this the hard problem of consciousness. It is the latest version of a classic problem in the philosophy of mind called the \"mind-body problem.\" A related problem is the problem of \"meaning\" or \"understanding\" (which philosophers call \"intentionality\"): what is the connection between our \"thoughts\" and \"what we are thinking about\" (i.e. objects and situations out in the world)? A third issue is the problem of \"experience\" (or \"phenomenology\"): If two people see the same thing, do they have the same experience? Or are there things \"inside their head\" (called \"qualia\") that can be different from person to person?\n\nNeurobiologists believe all these problems will be solved as we begin to identify the neural correlates of consciousness: the actual relationship between the machinery in our heads and its collective properties; such as the mind, experience and understanding. Some of the harshest critics of artificial intelligence agree that the brain is just a machine, and that consciousness and intelligence are the result of physical processes in the brain. The difficult philosophical question is this: can a computer program, running on a digital machine that shuffles the binary digits of zero and one, duplicate the ability of the neurons to create minds, with mental states (like understanding or perceiving), and ultimately, the experience of consciousness?\n\nJohn Searle asks us to consider a thought experiment: suppose we have written a computer program that passes the Turing test and demonstrates \"general intelligent action.\" Suppose, specifically that the program can converse in fluent Chinese. Write the program on 3x5 cards and give them to an ordinary person who does not speak Chinese. Lock the person into a room and have him follow the instructions on the cards. He will copy out Chinese characters and pass them in and out of the room through a slot. From the outside, it will appear that the Chinese room contains a fully intelligent person who speaks Chinese. The question is this: is there anyone (or anything) in the room that understands Chinese? That is, is there anything that has the mental state of understanding, or which has conscious awareness of what is being discussed in Chinese? The man is clearly not aware. The room cannot be aware. The \"cards\" certainly aren't aware. Searle concludes that the Chinese room, or \"any\" other physical symbol system, cannot have a mind.\n\nSearle goes on to argue that actual mental states and consciousness require (yet to be described) \"actual physical-chemical properties of actual human brains.\" He argues there are special \"causal properties\" of brains and neurons that gives rise to minds: in his words \"brains cause minds.\"\n\nGottfried Leibniz made essentially the same argument as Searle in 1714, using the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a mill. In 1974, Lawrence Davis imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 Ned Block envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called \"the Chinese Nation\" or \"the Chinese Gym\". Ned Block also proposed his Blockhead argument, which is a version of the Chinese room in which the program has been re-factored into a simple set of rules of the form \"see this, do that\", removing all mystery from the program.\n\nResponses to the Chinese room emphasize several different points. \n\nThe computational theory of mind or \"computationalism\" claims that the relationship between mind and brain is similar (if not identical) to the relationship between a \"running program\" and a computer. The idea has philosophical roots in Hobbes (who claimed reasoning was \"nothing more than reckoning\"), Leibniz (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas), Hume (who thought perception could be reduced to \"atomic impressions\") and even Kant (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules). The latest version is associated with philosophers Hilary Putnam and Jerry Fodor.\n\nThis question bears on our earlier questions: if the human brain is a kind of computer then computers can be both intelligent and conscious, answering both the practical and philosophical questions of AI. In terms of the practical question of AI (\"Can a machine display general intelligence?\"), some versions of computationalism make the claim that (as Hobbes wrote):\nIn other words, our intelligence derives from a form of \"calculation\", similar to arithmetic. This is the physical symbol system hypothesis discussed above, and it implies that artificial intelligence is possible. In terms of the philosophical question of AI (\"Can a machine have mind, mental states and consciousness?\"), most versions of computationalism claim that (as Stevan Harnad characterizes it):\nThis is John Searle's \"strong AI\" discussed above, and it is the real target of the Chinese room argument (according to Harnad).\n\nAlan Turing noted that there are many arguments of the form \"a machine will never do X\", where X can be many things, such as:\nBe kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humor, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.\nTuring argues that these objections are often based on naive assumptions about the versatility of machines or are \"disguised forms of the argument from consciousness\". Writing a program that exhibits one of these behaviors \"will not make much of an impression.\" All of these arguments are tangential to the basic premise of AI, unless it can be shown that one of these traits is essential for general intelligence.\n\nIf \"emotions\" are defined only in terms of their effect on behavior or on how they function inside an organism, then emotions can be viewed as a mechanism that an intelligent agent uses to maximize the utility of its actions. Given this definition of emotion, Hans Moravec believes that \"robots in general will be quite emotional about being nice people\". Fear is a source of urgency. Empathy is a necessary component of good human computer interaction. He says robots \"will try to please you in an apparently selfless manner because it will get a thrill out of this positive reinforcement. You can interpret this as a kind of love.\" Daniel Crevier writes \"Moravec's point is that emotions are just devices for channeling behavior in a direction beneficial to the survival of one's species.\"\n\nHowever, emotions can also be defined in terms of their subjective quality, of what it \"feels like\" to have an emotion. The question of whether the machine \"actually feels\" an emotion, or whether it merely \"acts as if\" it is feeling an emotion is the philosophical question, \"can a machine be conscious?\" in another form.\n\n\"Self awareness\", as noted above, is sometimes used by science fiction writers as a name for the essential human property that makes a character fully human. Turing strips away all other properties of human beings and reduces the question to \"can a machine be the subject of its own thought?\" Can it \"think about itself\"? Viewed in this way, a program can be written that can report on its own internal states, such as a debugger. Though arguably self-awareness often presumes a bit more capability; a machine that can ascribe meaning in some way to not only its own state but in general postulating questions without solid answers: the contextual nature of its existence now; how it compares to past states or plans for the future, the limits and value of its work product, how it perceives its performance to be valued-by or compared to others.\n\nTuring reduces this to the question of whether a machine can \"take us by surprise\" and argues that this is obviously true, as any programmer can attest. He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways. It must be possible, even trivial, for a computer that can represent ideas to combine them in new ways. (Douglas Lenat's Automated Mathematician, as one example, combined ideas to discover new mathematical truths.) Kaplan and Haenlein suggest that machines can display scientific creativity, while it seems likely that humans will have the upper hand where artistic creativity is concerned.\n\nIn 2009, scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U.K's University of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently come up with new scientific findings. Also in 2009, researchers at Cornell developed Eureqa, a computer program that extrapolates formulas to fit the data inputted, such as finding the laws of motion from a pendulum's motion.\n\nThis question (like many others in the philosophy of artificial intelligence) can be presented in two forms. \"Hostility\" can be defined in terms function or behavior, in which case \"hostile\" becomes synonymous with \"dangerous\". Or it can be defined in terms of intent: can a machine \"deliberately\" set out to do harm? The latter is the question \"can a machine have conscious states?\" (such as intentions) in another form.\n\nThe question of whether highly intelligent and completely autonomous machines would be dangerous has been examined in detail by futurists (such as the Singularity Institute). (The obvious element of drama has also made the subject popular in science fiction, which has considered many differently possible scenarios where intelligent machines pose a threat to mankind.)\n\nOne issue is that machines may acquire the autonomy and intelligence required to be dangerous very quickly. Vernor Vinge has suggested that over just a few years, computers will suddenly become thousands or millions of times more intelligent than humans. He calls this \"the Singularity.\" He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans. This is discussed by a philosophy called Singularitarianism.\n\nIn 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved \"cockroach intelligence.\" They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.\n\nSome experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions. The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.\n\nThe President of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence has commissioned a study to look at this issue. They point to programs like the Language Acquisition Device which can emulate human interaction.\n\nSome have suggested a need to build \"Friendly AI\", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.\n\nFinally, those who believe in the existence of a soul may argue that \"Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul.\" Alan Turing called this \"the theological objection\". He writes\nIn attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates.\n\nSome scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental. In the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\", some philosophers argue that the role of philosophy in AI is underappreciated. Physicist David Deutsch argues that without an understanding of philosophy or its concepts, AI development would suffer from a lack of progress.\n\nThe main bibliography on the subject, with several sub-sections, is on PhilPapers\n\nThe main conference series on the issue is \"Philosophy and Theory of AI\" (PT-AI), run by Vincent C. Müller\n\n"}

Propaganda in The Islamic Republic of Iran is also about the information that is not broadcast to the masses due to censorship.\n\nOne of the biggest issues Iran is criticized for is censorship. Aided by Western technology from Nokia and Siemens, the Iranian government has created one of the most sophisticated censorship platforms created in modern times.\n\nThe flags of nations are considered propaganda. Not only is the flag itself a representation of propaganda, but the flags of other nations, such as the United States and Israel, are used in Iranian Propaganda. Burning of the U.S. flag and Israeli Flag seem to occur at rallies against each. Flag burning is a propaganda tool, such as burning Effigies of world leaders.\n\nOn October 8, 2006, cleric Seyyed Hossein Kazemeini Boroujerdi was arrested for opposing Velaayat-e Faghih, advocating the separation of religion from state, and defending the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\\n\nIranian Justice System has also been known to espouse propaganda. This is especially true in the prison system of Iran where Political prisoners were \"incessantly bombarded with propaganda from all sides ... radio and closed-circuit television ... loudspeakers blaring into all cells even into solitary cells and `the coffins` [where some prisoners were kept] ... ideological sessions.\" Any reading material of a secular nature such as Western novelists, or even religious material that didn't agree ideologically with the Islamic Republic such as work by Ali Shariati was banned.\n\nThe Basij are the local and grassroot supporters of the Iranian government. \"The mission of the Basij as a whole can be broadly defined as helping to maintain law and order; enforcing ideological and Islamic values and combating the \"Western cultural onslaught\"; assisting the IRGC in defending the country against foreign threats; and involvement in state-run economic projects.\"\n\nWith the IRGC's help and support, Basij members are trained in propaganda and political warfare techniques using media outlets. There are about 21,000 volunteer \"reporters\" that have trained with the IRGC on multiple waves of communication and media, which include social networks, television, radio, print media, and the internet.\n\nAccording to Reporters Without Borders, \"In Iran, the Revolutionary Guards recently announced their ambition to build their own spinternet by launching 10,000 blogs for the Basij, a paramilitary force under the Guards. This comes at a time when the Internet has become a major force in exposing corruption in the highest ranks of the Iranian leadership.\" As well, cyber-police \"are here to create a cyber police force inside the people’s mind,” said Hesamedin Mojtahed, the officer in charge of the booth. “People want to be informed of the dangers on the Internet,” he said. “We are here for them.”\n\nThe Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a special unit within the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran has practiced for Psychological Operations against military targets. According to Ayatollah Khamenei, \"the main priority of the country is to confront (enemy's) soft warfare which is aimed at creating doubt, discord and pessimism among the masses of the people,\" Ayatollah Khamenei said last year, addressing a large and fervent congregation of Basij (volunteer) forces.\"\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting is the sole, official provider, of broadcast news to both the Iranian people and the rest of the world. IRIB operates many channels in a multitude of languages and is known to broadcast propaganda. IRIB is the main hub for which all Iranian propaganda is created, and disseminated, throughout the world. The multiple channels that make up IRIB all have a specific purpose.\n\nAhmadinejad's visit to Cornell was exclusively for propaganda purposes. Ahmadinejad firmly believes he can convince global opinion and the American people of the rightness of his cause.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran held an anti-terrorism conference which featured representatives from \"neighboring countries Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan as well as Sudan, Tajikistan, Mauritania and the Vice-President of Cuba and Ministers and other high-level delegates from 60 States, representatives of the United Nations (Officer in Charge of CTITF), the OIC, and other regional organizations as well as distinguished scholars and researchers and peace activists from all around the world participated in the Conference.\" With Iran being a state-sponsor of terrorist activities, and many of the nations in attendance, including many of the African representatives, users of terrorism, the anti-terrorism conference is propaganda. It was quite successful as well because the United Nations endorsed the meeting and sent a delegation to partake in the event. During the event, \"Iran's Supreme leader Ali Khamenei took the opportunity to excoriate western nations for \"terrorist behaviors,\" and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed his doubts about the September 2001 terrorist attacks on America – outrageously claiming that the U.S has benefited from those attacks, as it has, he added, from the Holocaust.\"\n\nIran has created a Cyber Police unit in January 2011, known by the acronym FATA. Since then it has arrested several bloggers critical of Iran’s leaders, as well as a group of youths who had created a “hot or not” contest on Facebook rating profile pictures of boys and girls The unit was created to \"control which sites Iranians are able to visit, to prevent spying and protect the public from `immoral` material. The United States, they charge, is waging a `soft war` against Iran by reaching out to Iranians online and inciting them to overthrow their leaders \". From the Iranian regime's standpoint, any free information is a threat to power. The internet was a major factor for organizing and showing the world what was happening during the 2009 presidential election. The United States asked Twitter to postpone online maintenance in 2009 so that it would be available for Iranian protesters. On 1 December 2012, General Saeed Shokrian, commander of FATA, was dismissed by Iranian’s national police chief, Ismael Ahmadi-Moqaddam, for negligence in death of blogger Sattar Beheshti while in FATA custody one month earlier. The dismissal followed international outcry over the death. Shokrian stated “Tehran’s FATA should be held responsible for the death of Sattar Beheshti”.\n\nThe Alavi Foundation is the successor organization to the Pahlavi Foundation, a nonprofit group used by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to advance Iran's charitable interests in America. Most of the charities income is from rent collected on the New York Fifth Avenue skyscraper the Piaget Building, which was built in 1978 under the Shah, who was overthrown in 1979.\n\nThe FBI laid out a case against the Alavi Foundation that it was being used as a front group for the Iranian government. It was built in the 1970s by the Pahlavi Foundation to further the interest of then Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Some of the tenants of the foundation's properties are Islamic centers and schools.\n"}

In many countries, the bush jacket is known as a guayabera. In Africa, the bush jacket is known as a safari shirt and is worn in the same manner as the safari jacket.\n\nThe quadrille is only danced in Jamaica and Trinidad today as a show. Dancers will usually wear the Jamaican folk costume, which consist of a gathered skirt of red madras bandana worn with a white peasant blouse. A matching head scarf is often worn tied in a sort of turban fashion. This costume is unlikely to be \"bespoke\" as it is only worn as a costume, for dancers, folk singers, tour guides etc. It represents the clothing worn by the ordinary folk in roughly the eighteenth century. Sometimes beauty pageant contestants wear creative evening dresses inspired by the national costume. \n\nThe bush jacket is hardly traditional. It was introduced for political reasons in the 1970s and some men continue to wear it as a matter of taste. Traditional attire for weddings, funerals, court dates etc. is an ordinary suit. Office attire is either a suit or shirt and tie. The bush jacket is an option one sees occasionally. \n\nOne would not expect to see the folk costume at a wedding. The groom would wear a conventional suit, the bride a fashionable white gown. Guests would wear suits and semi-formal dresses. One or two of the men may wear bush jackets. \n\nThe only occasion where a man would wear a madras shirt and white trousers would be if he were performing on the stage, either singing traditional folk songs or some sort of calypso or mento in the tourist circuit.\n\nIn Haiti, the quadrille dress is called a karabela dress. Traditional male attire for dances, weddings, and other formal wear is the linen shirt jacket.\n\nIn St. Lucia, the name of the dress is spelled Kwadril dress.\n\n"}

{"id": "615209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=615209", "title": "Speaking clock", "text": "Speaking clock\n\nA speaking clock or talking clock is a live or recorded human voice service, usually accessed by telephone, that gives the correct time. The first telephone speaking clock service was introduced in France, in association with the Paris Observatory, on 14 February 1933.\n\nThe format of the service is similar to that of radio time signal services. At set intervals (\"e.g\". ten seconds) a voice announces (for example) \"At the third stroke, the time will be twelve forty-six and ten seconds...\", with three beeps following. Some countries have sponsored time announcements and include the sponsor's name in the message.\n\nIn 1995, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has set up nine speaking clocks.\n\n\nThe voice is computer-generated in ten languages: Chinese (Singapore), English (every country), Indonesian (Indonesia), Khmer (Cambodia), Lao (Laos), Malay (Malaysia, Brunei), Tagalog (Philippines), Tamil (Singapore), Thai (Thailand) and Vietnamese (Vietnam).\n\nThis service replaced services in Malaysia (owned by F3), Philippines, Singapore and Thailand (owned by the navy), which already had speaking clock services.\n\nIn Argentina, users can reach the automatic time service dialing 113 from almost every fixed line operator.\n\nIn Australia, the number 1194 gives the speaking clock in all areas and from all providers. It is always the current time from where the call originates. A male voice, often known by Australians as George, says \"At the third stroke, it will be (hours) (minutes) and (seconds) seconds/precisely. (three beeps)\" e.g. \"At the third stroke, it will be three thirty three and forty seconds ... beep beep beep\". These are done in 10 second increments and the beep is 1 kHz.\nPrior to automatic systems, the subscriber rang an operator who would quote the time from a central clock in the exchange with a phrase such as \"The time by the exchange clock is...\". This was not precise and the operator could not always answer when the subscriber wanted. In 1954, British-made systems were installed in Melbourne and Sydney. The mechanical speaking clock used rotating glass discs where different parts of the time were recorded on the disc. A synchronous motor drove the disc with the driving source derived from a 5 MHz quartz oscillator via a multi stage valve divider. This was amplified to give sufficient impetus to drive the motor. Because of the low torque available, a hand wheel was used to spin the motor on start up. The voice was provided by Gordon Gow. The units were designed for continuous operation. Both units in Melbourne and Sydney were run in tandem (primary and backup). For daylight saving time changes, one would be on line while the second was advanced or delayed by one hour and at the 02:00:00 Australian Eastern Standard time, would be switched over to the standby unit.\n\nAs well as the speaking clocks, there was ancillary equipment to provide timing signals, 1 pulse per second, 8 pulses per minute and 8 pulses per hour. The Time and Frequency Standards Section in the PMG Research Laboratories at 59 Little Collins Street, Melbourne maintained the frequency checks to ensure that the system was \"on time\". From a maintenance point of view, the most important part of the mechanical clocks was to ensure that they were well oiled to minimise wear on the cams and to replace blown bulbs in the optical pickups from the glass disk recordings. When Time & Frequency Standards moved from 59 Collins Street to Clayton, the control signals were duplicated and a second bank of Caesium Beam Primary standards installed so the cutover was transparent with no loss of service.\n\nThis mechanical system was replaced with a digital system in 1990. Each speaking clock ensemble consisted of two announcing units (Zag 500), a supervisory unit (CCU 500), two phase-locked oscillators, two pulse distribution units, a Civil Time Receiver (plus a spare), and two or four Computime 1200 baud modems. The voice was provided by Richard Peach, a former ABC broadcaster. The various components were sent for commercial production after a working prototype was built in the Telstra Research Laboratory (TRL). Assmann Australia used a German announcing unit and built a supervisory unit to TRL specifications. Design 2000 incorporated TRL oscillators in the phase locked oscillator units designed at TRL and controlled by two tone from the Telstra Caesium beam frequency standards. Ged Company built civil time receivers. The civil time code generators and two tone generators were designed and built within TRL. The changeover occurred at 11:59:52, September 12, 1990.\n\nEach state capital had a digital speaking clock for the local time of day with one access number for all Australia, 1194. In 2002 the Telstra 1194 service was migrated to Informatel (which uses its own digital technology, in conjunction with the National Measurement Institute — but kept the original voice of Richard Peach), whilst the other time services (e.g. hourly pips to radio stations) were retained as a service by Telstra. In May 2006 the remaining Telstra services were withdrawn and the digital hardware was decommissioned. The 1194 service, though no longer provided by Telstra, is still operated by Informatel in partnership with Telstra.\n\nIn Austria, the speaking clock (\"Zeitansage\", which literally means \"time announcement\") can be reached at 0810 00 1503 since 2009. A recorded female voice says (for instance): \"Es wird mit dem Summerton 15 Uhr, 53 Minuten und 10 Sekunden\", meaning \"At the buzzing tone, the time will be 15 hours, 53 minutes and 10 seconds\", followed by a short pause and a 1 kHz, 0.25 seconds long beep (even though the announcement \"buzzing tone\" suggests otherwise). The time is announced in 10 second intervals.\nBefore 2009, the speaking clock was available by dialing 1503. Until there, the voice was generated by an Assmann ZAG500, which was also used in Australia. This has been replaced by a voice server.\n\nIn Barbados, daily time and temperature conditions are provided by the firm Accuweather and can obtained by the number +1.246.976.8463. Daily weather conditions are now at a separate number +1.246.976.2376.\n\nIn Belgium, the speaking clock used to be reachable on the numbers 1200 (Dutch language), 1300 (French language), and 1400 (German language). Starting September 2012, the service is only reachable on the numbers +32 78 05 12 00 (Dutch Language), +32 78 05 13 00 (French language) and +32 78 05 14 00 (German language). At the time of the number change, the service received 5000 calls per day. \n\nIn Brazil, the user can access a non-free Speaking clock service, dialing the \"130\" number.\n\nIn Cambodia, the speaking clock number is 107 for Phnom Penh and 023-107 for other provinces. The call rate is KHR 300 per minute in Phnom Penh.\n\nIn Canada, the National Research Council (NRC) is the federal agency responsible for official time.\n\nNRC time is referred to its primary cesium atomic clocks designed, built, and maintained at the NRC time standards laboratory in Ottawa.\n\nThe NRC provides a Telephone Talking Clock service; voice announcements of Eastern Time are made every 10 seconds, followed by a tone indicating the exact time. This service is available to the general public by dialing +1 613 745-1576 for English service and +1 613 745-9426 for French service. Long-distance charges apply for those calling from outside the Ottawa/Gatineau area. The voices of the time announcements are Harry Mannis in English and Simon Durivage in French.\n\nThe NRC also offers CHU as a continuous shortwave time broadcast, and an FM broadcast time signal once daily at 1:00 pm EST on the main CBC Radio One and Première Chaîne networks.\n\nThe Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy provides a toll-free speaking clock at +56 (800) 800 780.\n\nDialing 117 in any city connects to a speaking clock that tells you the current Beijing Time. If you dial 117 via a landline or mobile phone in the country, you will still be charged for communication. Rates are charged according to the ordinary local number, generally around 0.25 RMB/minute. . Please note that despite the vast area of China, all areas keep the same time.\n\nIn Bogotá, ETB provides a speaking clock service which can be reached by dialing 117 from a landline phone\n\nIn the Czech Republic, the speaking clock can be reached by dialing 14112.\n\nThe Danish telephone company KTAS introduced the automated time service \"Frøken Klokken\" (Miss Clock) in 1939, originally voiced by telephonist Anna Edith Sommer-Jensen (1918–2008). In 1970, a new system used the voice recordings of Marianne Germers. The service was digitised in 1993.\n\nThe TDC Speaking Clock can be heard by calling +45 70 10 11 55 outside Denmark and on 70 10 11 55 within Denmark.\n\nIn Finland the speaking clock service is known as \"Neiti Aika\" in Finnish or \"Fröken Tid\" in Swedish, both of which mean \"Miss Time\". The first Neiti Aika service was started in 1936 and was the first automated phone service in Finland. The service is provided by regional phone companies and can be reached by dialling 10061 in the whole country. The voice of the speaking clock can be male or female depending on whose phone company service you are using. Nowadays the use of the Neiti Aika service has decreased pretty much to null and the press officer of Auria, the regional phone company of Turku, stated in an article of the \"Turun Sanomat\" newspaper that when the company started the service in 1938 it was used 352,310 times in its starting year compared to 1300 times in September 2006.\n\nIn France, the speaking clock (\"horloge parlante\") has been in service since 14 February 1933. It is available on 36.99 from within France, and was formerly available from overseas by dialing +33 8.36.99.xx.xx (where x could be anything). However, since September 2011 a call placed from outside France or its territories yields only a recording indicating that the number is no longer available.\n\nIn Germany, the speaking clock from Deutsche Telekom is available by dialling 0180 4 100 100. At the beginning of the call, the date is announced.\n\nAnother speaking clock service based in Hamburg is available by dialling 040 42 89 90 within Germany and +49 40 42 89 90 from abroad. Just the normal fixed line phone rate applies. This services just announces what the time will be at the tone in German, in a similar style to the English language services.\n\nIn Greece, the speaking clock can be heard by calling 14814.\n\nThe Icelandic speaking clock service (\"klukkan\"), provided by Síminn, can be reached by dialing (+354) 155.\n\nAll over the country, calling 20119 will connect people to the speaking clock in Persian language.\n\nThe Eir speaking clock was permanently closed down on 27 August 2018. The standardised service, introduced in July 1970, ran for some 48 years. It was originally reached by dialling the short code 191, later changed to 1191.\n\nThe format used was an announcement at 10 second intervals saying: \"At the signal it will be, HH:MM and XX seconds\" followed by a short high-pitched tone.\n\nAll over the country calling 1455 will connect to the speaking clock in Hebrew or English provided by Bezeq.\n\nThe Japanese telephone company NTT provides a non-free speaking clock on the nationally universal number 117.\n\nThe non-free Lattelecom speaking clock is provided in both Latvian and Russian languages and can be reached by dialing either (+371) 82154 or 82174, respectively. The precise time is given immediately upon connection, rather than after a certain signal.\n\nIn Malaysia, there are two speaking clock services. The first one is obtained by dialling 1051, which is owned by SIRIM Berhad, another one can ve heard by calling 181, which is owned by LKS Group, a private group of companies. Both are available only in Malay language.\n\nOn 1 October 1930, a system was installed in the Haarlem telephone exchange (automated in 1925) which indicated the time using series of tones, with number 15290.\n\nIn 1934, electronic engineer and inventor F.H. Leeuwrik was requested to build a speaking clock for the municipal telephone service of The Hague. His experience with sound film made him decide to use optically recorded speech, looping on a large drum. There were loops for the hours and for the minutes, each one read with a photodetector. Every minute the clock gave an electric pulse, causing the mechanism to shift to the next minute. Every hour, the minute mechanism was reset (and every day the hour mechanism), the clock was accurate within one minute only. The female voice was provided by the then 24-year-old school teacher Cor Hoogendam, hence the machine was nicknamed \"Tante Cor\" (Aunt Cor). The speaking clock came into service at November 9, 1934 and could be reached by dialing 393131. The service became so popular, that in 1935 a second machine was ordered and built. In total F.H. Leeuwrik built 19 machines, one for each telephone district. Starting with the 's-Hertogenbosch exchange in 1941, the number was gradually harmonized nationwide to 002 (or K 02) for all automated exchanges. Even during the Nazi occupation in World War II, the speaking clock was called over two million times a year. During World War II, 12 machines were destroyed and rebuilt after the War by the inventor himself.\n\nIn 1969 this system was decommissioned and replaced by a machine that looked like a record player with three pick-up arms. The speaking clock was now much more accurate, telling the time at 10 second intervals followed by a beep, indicating the precise moment. The text was spoken by actress Willie Brill and had the following format: \"Bij de volgende toon is het .. uur, .. minuten en .. seconden\" (at the following tone, it is .. hour, .. minutes and .. seconds). The service was now called over 130 million times a year.\n\nFinally, in April 1992, all of this machinery was replaced by a digital device with no moving parts. The (digitized) voice was provided by actress Joke Driessen and the clock's accuracy is maintained by linking it to the German longwave radio transmitter DCF77. To comply with international guidelines limiting double-zero to use as an international prefix, the 002 number was changed on 3 December 1990 to 06-8002, and later to 0900-8002. Even though many people today have access to accurate time displays from digital wristwatches, mobile phones, and computers, the service still receives approximately four million calls a year, especially around New Year's Eve and whenever the clocks change in connection with daylight saving time.\n\nThe speaking clock in New Zealand is run by the Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand. The service is reached by dialling 0900 45 678 (calls are 99c per minute). MSL has been running the service since 1989.\n\nThe speaking clock (, meaning \"Miss Clock\") in Norway was in service between 1932 and 15 January 2007 14h00 local time. The service could be reached by dialling 09170 \"(1999–2007),\" and 170 \"(until 1999).\" Among the women who contributed with their voices for the service were actress Randi Brennes (–1992) and Kristin Johnson (1992–2007). When the service ceased it still got about 2000–3000 calls per month.\n\nThe speaking clock in Poland is known as \"Zegarynka\" which means \"the clock girl\".\nThe service became first available in 1936 and it was using a device invented and patented in Poland. It was speaking with the recorded voice of actress Lidia Wysocka. The first cities to be equipped with this device were Katowice, Warszawa (dialing number 05), Gdynia, Toruń and Kraków (July 1936).\n\nFor many years the number was 926, but due to the EU regulations reserving all 3-digit numbers for emergency services only, it was changed in the early 2000s. The connection is charged on a per-minute basis. In 2009 the number was changed to 19226.\n\nSince 1936, the voiced has been changed twice.\n\nTo hear the current time in Russia you dial 100 or 060, depending on the city where this service is available. These calls are free if made from non-mobile phones.\nIn Moscow, the Speaking Clock number is 100 if dialed from within the city, or +7-495-100-xxxx from other countries (where x can be anything).\nAt one time in Moscow there were advertisements before and after the announcement of the current time; this practice has since ceased.\n\nThe speaking clock in South Africa is reached by dialling 1026 from fixed or mobile networks and consists of a female voice reading the time in 24-hour format, alternating between Afrikaans and English. All of South Africa is in the time zone UTC+2 without any daylight saving time so the speaking clock is the same all over the country.\n\nIn Spain, the speaking clock could be heard by calling 093.\n\nSri Lanka Telecom provides a Speaking Clock service in three languages.\nMore details can be found on SLT telephone directories.\n\nThe speaking clock (, literally \"Miss Clock\") in Sweden has been in service since 6 October 1934, and can be reached by dialling 90510 (+46 33 90510 or +46 8 90510 from outside Sweden). Four women have contributed with their voices for the service: Eva Ulvby (1934–1956), Berit Hofling (1956–1968), Ebba Beckman (1968–2000), Johanna Hermann Lundberg (2000-).\n\nThe speaking clock can be reached under 161 and is bilingual in French and German with the voices alternating between the two languages, the time in German being announced at 0, 20 and 40 seconds and the time in French announced at 10, 30 and 50 seconds past the minute.\n\nIn Taiwan, the speaking clock can be reached by dialing 117.\n\nTo hear the local current time in Ukraine, a person can reach a service of the exact time by dialing 121 from any city in that country.\n\nIn Thailand, the number of the speaking clock is 181.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the speaking clock can be reached by dialling 123 on a BT phone line; the number may vary on other networks. \nEvery ten seconds, a voice announces:\n\nFor times that are an exact minute, \"precisely\" is substituted for the seconds portion of the announcement. Similarly, announcements for times between the hour and one minute past the hour substitute \"o'clock\" for the (zero) minutes. Other operators run their own speaking clocks, with broadly similar formats, or redirect to BT's service. Virgin Media have their own service available by dialling 123 from a Virgin Media line. . Sky also have their own service accessible from dialling 123 from a Sky telephone line. \n\nA speaking clock service was first introduced in the United Kingdom on July 24, 1936. The mechanism used was an array of motors, glass discs, photocells and valves which took up the floorspace of a small room. The voice was that of London telephonist Ethel Jane Cain, who had won a prize of 10 guineas in a competition to find the right voice. Cain's voice was recorded optically onto the glass disks in a similar way to a film soundtrack. The service was obtained by dialling the letters TIM (846) on a dial telephone, and hence the service was often colloquially referred to as \"Tim\". However this code was only used in the telephone systems of the cities of London, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. Other areas initially dialled 952 but with the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling it was changed to 80 and later 8081 as more 'recorded services' were introduced and was standardised to 123 by the early 1990s.\n\nThe time announcements were made by playing short, recorded phrases or words in the correct sequence. In an interview with Manchester Radio in 1957 Miss Cain said:\n\nIn 1963, the original device was replaced by more modern recording technology using a magnetic drum. The company that manufactured the rotating magnetic drum part of the Speaking Clock was Roberts & Armstrong (Engineers) Ltd of North Wembley. They took on the licence from the British Post Office to manufacture complete clocks for the telecommunications authorities of Denmark, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland, and a third (spare) clock for the British Post Office. This latter was installed in Bow Street, London. The European clocks were modified for the 24-hour system by lengthening the drum and adding extra heads. Roberts & Armstrong subcontracted the electronic aspects to the Synchronome Company of Westbury. The clocks were designed to run non-stop for 20 years. This system gave way to the present digital system in 1984, which uses a built-in crystal oscillator and microprocessor logic control. The complete apparatus comprises solid-state microchips, occupies no more shelf space than a small suitcase and has no moving parts at all. The BT service is assured to be accurate to five-thousandths of a second.\n\nIn 1986, BT allowed Accurist to sponsor its franchise, the first time a sponsor had been used for the service. In the latter years of this sponsorship, it cost 30 pence to call the speaking clock. Accurist announced its withdrawal from the deal and the launch of an online \"British Real Time\" website on 24 August 2008.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the British Telecom speaking clock network was designed to be used in case of nuclear attack to broadcast messages from Strike Command at RAF High Wycombe to HANDEL units at regional police stations. From there, automatic warning sirens could be started and alerts sent to Royal Observer Corps monitoring posts and other civil defence volunteers equipped with manual warning devices. The rationale for using an existing rather than a dedicated system was that it was effectively under test at all times, rather than being activated (and possibly found to be faulty) only in the event of war. The signals to automatic sirens were sent down the wires of individual (unaware) subscribers for the same reason — a customer would report any fault as soon as it occurred, whereas a problem with a dedicated line would not be noticed until it was needed.\n\nA version of the speaking clock was also used on recordings of proceedings at the Houses of Parliament made by the BBC Parliament Unit, partly as a time reference and partly to prevent editing. On a stereo recording, one track was used for the sound and the other for an endless recording of the speaking clock – without the pips, as these were found to cause interference.\n\nOn the occasion of a leap second, such as at 23:59:60 on December 31, 2005, there is an extra second pause between the second and third beeps thus keeping the speaking clock in sync with Coordinated Universal Time. So it will sound like this: “At the third stroke, the time from BT will be, twelve o’clock precisely. Beep, Beep, <pause> Beep.” The current source of UK time is provided, though not monitored, by the National Physical Laboratory, UK. Since 2003, the British speaking clock has changed voices four times. Almost all changes have occurred on days when the clocks have switched from standard time to daylight saving time or vice versa. This is due to the fact that 123 is most commonly dialled on these days.\n\nThe speaking clock service is not available on the 3 and Orange mobile telephone networks, as they use 123 as the number for their voicemail services.\n\nThe BT Speaking Clock receives around 70 million calls a year.\n\nA separate, non-BT service to access a speaking clock using the voice of Pat Simmons, is available at 0871 976 2819. However, the number of calls it can receive at any one time is limited. Another service, available at 0871 976 2839, announces the time in different voices from the past British, American and Australian services. The service always announces UK time regardless of the voice used.\n\nThere have been five permanent voices for the speaking clock. Temporary voices have been used on special occasions, usually with BT donating the call fees collected to charity.\n\n\n\nThe first automated time service in the United States began in Atlanta, Georgia in 1934 as a promotion for Tick Tock Ginger Ale. Company owner John Franklin modified Western Electric technology to create the machine that would become known as the Audichron. The Audichron Company became the chief supplier of talking clocks in the US, maintained by local businesses and, later, the regional Bell System companies.\n\nThe service became typically known as the \"Time of Day\" service, with the term \"speaking clock\" never being used. Occasionally it would be called \"Time and Temperature\" or simply \"Time\". However, the service had been phased out in most states (Nevada and Connecticut still maintain service). AT&T discontinued its California service in September 2007, citing the widespread availability of sources such as mobile phones and computers.\n\nFor all area codes in Northern California, and on the West Coast generally, the reserved exchange was 767 which was often indicated by its phoneword, POPCORN; the service was discontinued in 2007. In other locations, different telephone exchanges are or were used for the speaking clock service.\n\n\n\nMany shortwave radio time signal services provide speaking clock services, such as WWV (voiced by John Doyle) and WWVH (voiced by Jane Barbe), operated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology from the United States of America. To avoid disruption with devices that rely on the accurate timings and placement of the service tones from the radio, the voice recording is \"notched\" clear of some of the tones.\n\nThe time as provided by WWV is also available by telephone, by calling +1 303 499-7111. WWVH (an auxiliary location in Hawaii) is available at +1 808 335-4363.\n\nIn addition, the United States Naval Observatory operates two speaking clocks: in Washington, D.C. at +1 202 762 1401 or +1 202 762 1069, and in Colorado Springs, Colorado at +1 719 567 6742. These use the voice from Fred Covington (1928–1993) since 1978 and still do today. \n\nElectronic speaking clocks and wristwatches are available, many marketed to the visually impaired.\n\nMany telephone answering machines and similar devices include a speaking clock capability so they can announce the time when a message was received.\n\n\n"}

It was also carved on his seal and stamped on the coins minted during his reign. Very elaborate decorated versions were created for important documents that were also works of art in the tradition of Ottoman illumination, such as the example of Suleiman the Magnificent in the gallery below.\n\nThe tughra was designed at the beginning of the sultan's reign and drawn by the court calligrapher or \"nişancı\" on written documents. The first tughra belonged to Orhan I (1284–1359), the second ruler of the Ottoman Empire and it evolved until it reached the classical form in the tughra of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent (1494–1566).\n\nTughras served a purpose similar to the cartouche in ancient Egypt or the Royal Cypher of British monarchs. Every Ottoman sultan had his own individual tughra.\n\nThe tughra has a characteristic form, two loops on the left side, three vertical lines in the middle, stacked writing on the bottom and two extensions to the right. Each of these elements has a specific meaning, and together they make up the form that is easily recognizable as a tughra. \n\nThe name of the sultan is written out in the bottom section, called a \"sere\". Depending on the period, this name can be as simple as Orhan, son of Osman in the first tughra in 1326. In later periods honorifics and prayers are also added to the name of the tughra holder and his father.\n\nThe loops to the left of the tughra are called \"beyze\", from Arabic meaning \"egg\". Some interpretations of tughra design claim that the beyzes are supposed to symbolize the two seas the sultans held sway over: the outer larger loop signifying the Mediterranean and the inner, smaller loop signifying the Black Sea.\n\nThe vertical lines on the top of the tughra are called \"tuğ\", or flagstaff. The three tugs signify independence. The S-shaped lines crossing the tugs are called \"zülfe\" and they, together with the tops of the tugs that also look to the right, signify that the winds blow from the east to the west, the traditional movement of the Ottomans.\n\nThe lines to the right of the tughra are called \"hançer\" and signify a sword, symbol of power and might.\n\nAlthough the tughra is largely identified with the Ottoman Sultans, they have also sometimes been used in other Turkic states, such as the Qajar dynasty, Safavid Empire and the Khanate of Kazan. Later, tughras were used among the Tatars of Imperial Russia.\n\nThe Mughal Emperors are also known to have used calligraphic symbols, alongside the Ottomans, the Mughal \"Tughra\" was circular in shape with three points at its tip, beside the calligraphic signature of the emperor.\nThere are modern artists of calligraphy that use the characteristic tughra form today. Examples are the tughras of Russian president Vladimir Putin and Akihito, the Emperor of Japan, created by artist Vladimir Popov.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4244012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4244012", "title": "Tübatulabal language", "text": "Tübatulabal language\n\nTübatulabal is an extinct Uto-Aztecan language, traditionally spoken in Kern County, California, United States. It is the traditional language of the Tübatulabal, who have now shifted to English. The language originally had three main dialects: Bakalanchi, Pakanapul and Palegawan.\n\nIn English, the name Tübatulabal refers to both the Tübatulabal people and their language. However, in the language itself, the term Tübatulabal refers only to the Tübatulabal people. Its origin is unclear, but it may be related to the noun stem \"\" \"pine nuts\". The Tübatulabal term for the Tübatulabal language is \".\"\n\nThere are six phonemic vowels in Tübatulabal:\n\nContrastive short and long versions of each vowel are found in both stressed and unstressed syllables. The vowels have various allophones which occur in different environments, most notably more central lax allophones when the vowels are short and occur in unstressed syllables. \"i\" and \"u\" can occur as the second member of a diphthong with any other vowel, resulting in ten possible diphthongs (Voegelin reports that \"ɨu\" is rare). Phonologically, the members of a diphthong are treated as distinct segments. For example, the common initial reduplication process, which copies the first stem vowel, copies only the first member of a diphthong, e.g.:\n\n\" 'the sucker fish'\n\n\" 'the many suckers in one place'\n\nVowel length is contrastive. However, according to , in the suffixing morphology length is typically predictable. In most cases, the first suffix is short, the second suffix is long, the third suffix is short, and so on. For example, the verbal stem ' 'to eat' can be expanded to ' 'let us go and pretend to eat'. In this word, each suffix alternates in length compared to its neighbors. When arranged differently, the same suffixes will have different lengths. Thus compare ' 'let us' with the realization of the same morpheme in ' 'let us go eat'.\n\nTübatulabal consonants show a basic voicing distinction, with a corresponding alternately voiced phoneme present for almost every obstruent. Unlike English, Tübatulabal voiceless consonants are not aspirated.\n\nNon-contrastive allophones of all vowels occur, usually when a vowel follows a nasal consonant, and especially when it also precedes a glottal consonant.\n\nAll consonants except the glottal stop can occur as geminates. Gemination is often phonologically predictable. In particular, all consonants except the voiced stops and the glottal stop geminate when following a short vowel. All stops and affricates are geminated in word-final position, regardless of the length of the preceding vowel.\n\nTübatulabal has predictable word stress, which is tied to morphological constituency and syllable weight. Primary stress falls on the final syllable of the stem. Secondary stress is assigned right to left from the final syllable, falling on every other mora:\n\n\"\" \"he is wanting to roll string on his thigh\" \n\n\"\" \"the fruit is mashing\"\n\nWords with the form VːCVCV will be stressed as ˌVːCVˈCV:\n\n\"\" \"the pine-nut pole\"\n\nFor the purposes of stress assignment, two identical short vowels that are separated only by a glottal stop are treated as a single vowel if and only if they belong to the same morpheme:\n\n\"\" \"the little one\"\n\nThere are three basic word types in Tübatulabal: verbs, nouns, and particles. Verbs may be formed from verbal stems or from noun stems with verbalizing morphology; similarly, nouns can be formed from noun stems or from verbal stems with nominalizing morphology. Particles have their own stems, but they have comparatively little inflection, whereas both verbs and nouns tend to be very morphologically complex.\n\nThere are four word-formation processes in Tübatulabal: suffixation, reduplication, conjunction and compounding.\n\nSuffixation is the most common and productive process in agglutinative word-formation. Suffixes form a closed class and occur in a fixed order according to the word type.\n\nThere are two kinds of reduplication: full reduplication and partial reduplication. Full reduplication is the less common type and marks the iterative aspect in verbs.\n\nPartial reduplication can occur as initial or final reduplication. Final reduplication is very rare and always expresses the idea of plural allegiance. It is also apparently limited to occurring with noun stems or suffixes that end in \". Voegelin illustrates with an example:\n\n\" 'his hunting partner'\n\n\" 'his hunting partner (in the sense that the partner referred to, being very proficient, has many companions in hunting)'\n\nInitial reduplication is far more productive. It is used to express collective plurality in nouns\nand to express aspect reversal in verbs. Initial reduplication prefixes a copy of the first vowel of the stem (as well as any immediately following nasal), preceded by a fixed \". The underlying stem-initial consonant (if any) may also undergo changes, particularly in voicing and length. Some examples illustrate the reduplication process:\n\nConjunction involves the combination of a particle with a word of another type. According to Voegelin, the behavior of particles is similar to that of enclitics in other Uto-Aztecan languages but distinct enough from them that it should not be considered to be a kind of cliticization.\n\nCompounding appears to have been a much more productive process at an earlier stage of the language. It now has very limited productivity, and in many cases, it appears to have been completely lexicalized if it occurs.\n\nEach verb stem has an unpredictable inherent aspect value (either telic or atelic; by default, a bare stem is inherently atelic), and an inherent value for transitivity (transitive, intransitive or impersonal). The inherent values can be changed by morphological addition to yield a verb stem with any of the other possible values. Aspect reversal is indicated by initial reduplication. Transitivity change is indicated by the use of one (or more) of a number of derivational suffixes with which verbs are constructed.\n\nThe full verb structure can be summarized as (A) + B + (C) + (D), where B is the verb root, and the other positions (all optional) represent classes of morphemes. A indicates initial reduplication, which can occur only once per word. C indicates a class of derivational morphemes, which can be divided into ten ordered positions, each of which allows at most one morpheme per word. D is the final position; there are nine possible morphemes in final position, but only one can occur in any single word.\n\nThe C class morphemes are given with examples in the table below. When these morphemes co-occur in a word, they must occur in the order given. Transitivity changing morphemes are marked with *. They have a different effect depending on the inherent transitivity of the verb root, as well as the presence of other transitivity-changing morphology.\n\nThe possible verbal final morphemes (class D) are shown below. Unlike the class C morphemes, only one of these final-position morphemes can occur in any single word. Therefore, the ordering of morphemes in this table does not indicate anything about a linear relationship among the morphemes.\n\nAll nouns (whether derived from verb stems or noun stems) are obligatorily marked as absolute or relative. Nouns must also be marked with one of the three basic cases: subject, object, or genitive. Relative nouns make a finer distinction between suus and ejus objects and genitives. In addition to this obligatory morphology, nouns may also receive suffixes indicating several secondary cases (inessive, ablative, allative and instrumental) as well as many other derivational suffixes.\n\nNouns may be divided into three basic classes according to their stem shape and morphological behavior and sometimes according to their semantic contribution as well. The basic test for classification is how the noun occurs when it is absolute. The absolute suffix has a different allomorph when it occurs with a noun from each of these classes. Class A nouns all have vowel-final stems, and add the absolute suffix as -\"l\". Class B noun stems may be vowel-final or consonant-final, but in either case the absolute suffix is -\"t\". Class C is a small class of nouns, many of which are kinship terms or other inalienable nouns. The absolute noun is phonologically null when it occurs with class C nouns.\n\nEach of the classes can be subdivided into two or more classes, depending on phonological differences in the noun stem that lead to divergent behavior in certain case forms. Specifically, class A is divided into A1 nouns (stems end with a long vowel) and A2 nouns (stems end with a short vowel). Class B is divided into five subclasses, depending on whether the stem ends in a short vowel, a long vowel, \"n\", \"m\", or a voiceless consonant. Class C is divided into C1 (nouns which take an overt relative suffix) and C2 (nouns with no overt relative suffix).\n\nThe following table illustrates each of the noun classes and subclasses, with all obligatory cases:\n\nMorphemes belonging to the particle class are distinguished by the fact that they undergo little or no inflection and suffixation, unlike verbs and nouns. The particle class includes two subclasses of morphemes which behave quite differently: conjunctive particles and independent particles.\n\nConjunctive particles resemble clitics in that they never appear independently but always lean on another word. However, unlike clitics, conjunctive particles typically bear their own stress, and they do not alter the stress of the word on which they lean. Conjunctive particles include various discourse and modal morphemes as well as the typical pronominal agreement morphemes that occur with verbs.\n\nIndependent particles are fully independent words. They include prepositional, modal and exclamatory morphemes, numerals, and one class of pronouns.\n\nThe table below shows the pronominal morphemes of Tübatulabal. Like nouns, pronouns distinguish between three cases: subject, object and possessive. (Pronouns do not make a distinction between absolute and relative entities.) Different forms exist for first-, second- and third-person entities. Second- and third-person forms distinguish only singular and plural numbers, but first-person forms distinguish between singular, dual inclusive, dual exclusive, and plural numbers. All pronouns may be expressed bu conjunctive particles. The subject pronouns are unique in that they can also be expressed by an independent particle.\n\nThe first-person subject conjunctive forms have special allomorphs when they occur with the exhortative suffix -\"ma\":\n\nThe third-person conjunctive form is usually null, but it is expressed by -\"d͡za\" after the exhortative or permissive suffixes. (The suffix often undergoes syncope and devoicing, yielding -\"t͡s\".) The second-person conjunctive plural subject form may also syncopate, and medial vowel then shortens as well: -\"bum\". The first-person conjunctive singular subject form may also syncopate, triggering devoicing but no irregular phonology: the suffix then has the form -\"k\".\n\nSubject pronouns typically lean on verbs (if conjunctive) and correspond to grammatical subject: \"iwikkːɨki\" \"I discarded (it)\" (with devoicing); \"anabaːhaʃta\" \"they can throw it\" (with metathesis of the components of the affricate and a change of \"s\" > \"ʃ\").\n\nObject pronouns also lean on verbs and indicate any non-possessive oblique function, including transitive objects, ditransitive objects or benefactives, objects of imperative verbs, and subjects of subordinate verbs if not equivalent to the subject of the matrix verb.\n\nPossessive pronouns typically lean on the possessum: ' \"my house\"; ' \"his wife\".\n\nWord order is generally flexible. According to , \"Word-order in general is stylistic rather than obligatory.\" (p. 185)\n\nTranscriptions in this article follow the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Much published material concerning Tübatulabal uses the Americanist orthography. In addition, the most important linguistic work on Tübatulabal, the original grammatical description of the language, uses a somewhat different orthography.\n\nVoegelin writes ' as \"ï\" and ' as \"ô\". He also writes ' as \"c\", ' as \"tc\", ' as \"‘\", ' as \"dž\" and ' as \"y\". He also uses a number of special symbols for vocalic allomorphs. \"ι\" is an allomorph of \"i\", \"μ\" is an allomorph of \"u\", \"o\" is an allomorph of \"ô\" (IPA '), and \"ŏ\" is an allomorph of both \"a\" and \"ô\".\n\nThe letter \"ü\" in the name Tübatulabal represents the central unrounded vowel \"\".\n\n\n"}

It retells incidents from the life of the Brythonic seer Merlin, and is based on traditional material about him.\n\nMerlin is described as a prophet in the text. There are a number of episodes in which he loses his mind and lives in the wilderness like a wild animal, like Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel, or the Welsh wild man of the woods. It is also the first work to describe the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay, as \"Morgen\".\n\nGeoffrey had written of Merlin in his two previous works, the \"Prophetiae Merlini\", purporting to be a series of prophecies from the sage, and the \"Historia Regum Britanniae\", which is the first work presenting a link between Merlin and King Arthur. The \"Vita Merlini\" presents an account of Merlin much more faithful to the Welsh traditions about Myrddin Wyllt, the archetype behind Geoffrey's composite figure of Merlin. Whereas the \"Historia\" had Merlin associating with Arthur, his father Uther Pendragon, and his uncle Ambrosius in the 5th century, the \"Vita\"'s timeframe is during the late 6th century, and includes references to various figures from that period, including Gwenddoleu and Taliesin. Geoffrey attempts to synchronize the \"Vita\" with his earlier work by having Merlin mention he had been with Arthur long before.\n\n"}
