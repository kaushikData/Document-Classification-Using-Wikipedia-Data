{"id": "2548920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2548920", "title": "Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos", "text": "Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos\n\nAustralia's Naughtiest Home Videos is an Australian television comedy programme which was broadcast on Nine Network on 4 September 1992. It was a one-off special spin-off of \"Australia's Funniest Home Video Show\", depicting videos of sexual situations and other sexually explicit content. The programme was notably taken off the air partway through the broadcast of its first and only episode on the order of network owner Kerry Packer.\n\n\"Australia's Funniest Home Video Show\" premiered in 1990, and was similar in concept to the 1989 American special (and later series) \"America's Funniest Home Videos:\" viewers would send in amateur-shot videos that were unintentionally humorous, and the video deemed the \"funniest\" by the studio audience was awarded a prize at the end of the show. \n\nThe producers often received racy or risqué videos that couldn't be included into the programme due to its family-friendly nature, and since the show's policy stated that videos sent in by viewers couldn't be sent back, videos that didn't make it to the program were still kept by the station. The producers decided to compile these videos into a one-off special aimed at an adult audience.\n\nIt differed from \"Australia's Funniest Home Video Show\" in more than just the content of the videos. It had a different opening, a modified version of the \"Australia's Funniest Home Video Show\"'s theme song, and a slightly modified set. It was hosted by Australian radio personality Doug Mulray. Due to the difference in content, the show aired at 8:30 PM and was preceded by a short message warning viewers of the show's content, and informing them that it was a one-off special that was different from \"Australia's Funniest Home Video Show\".\n\nThe show followed the same structure of \"Australia's Funniest Home Video Show\", in which the videos were shown in short blocks, interspersed with humorous monologues written and delivered by Mulray. Mulray often poked fun at the content of the videos, which he described as \"The most sensational collection of home videos since Rodney King nicked out for a pizza recently.\" Mulray also did humorous voice overs as the videos were shown, similar to Lisa Patrick's on \"Australia's Funniest Home Video Show\".\n\nThe content of the videos included shots of animal genitalia, humans or animals humorously engaging in sexual intercourse, people who get accidentally and humorously disrobed, and other situations that often relied on ribald humour, including a child grabbing a kangaroo's testicles, a man lifting a barbell with his penis, a man getting his head squeezed between an erotic dancer's large breasts, an elderly woman removing an envelope from a stripper's undergarments with her dentures, two people running into water with flaming pieces of toilet paper hanging from their buttocks, and two people filmed having sex in the middle of a park.\n\nKerry Packer, the owner of the Nine Network at the time, was informed of the show's content by friends while having dinner. He tuned in to watch the show, which was being transmitted on TCN-9, and was so offended by its content that he phoned the studio operators and angrily shouted, \"Get that shit off the air!\" \n\nWithin minutes, the series was pulled. After the break, the Nine Network announced that it failed to continue airing the show, purportedly due to technical difficulties, and aired reruns of the American sitcom \"Cheers\" immediately afterwards to fill in the remaining airtime. In 2008, Bert Newton justified the broadcast explanation: \"It's \"technically\" very \"difficult\" to keep a show on air with Mr. Packer on the phone, yelling at you.\"\n\nAlthough the same bumper and announcement interrupted the show during every broadcast across Australia, it occurred in different parts of the programme depending on the area it was airing in, due to time differences: In the eastern states, the station simply started airing an episode of \"Cheers\" after a scheduled commercial break, but in other areas, the last part of the show broadcast was of Mulray giving a monologue about \"bosoms\" or the aforementioned clip of a child grabbing a kangaroo's scrotum. The show was cancelled before it was scheduled to air in Perth, and thus its Nine Network affiliate showed a brief message mentioning that the special wouldn't be aired before beginning an episode of \"Cheers\".\n\nDespite Packer's objections to the series' content, it was popular among viewers. The special was recorded to a record studio audience. After the announcement, Nine reportedly received \"thousands\" of phone calls from viewers, with 65 percent of callers upset with the programme being pulled, in contrast to the 60 callers who called in during the show's broadcast, complaining about the show. Viewers were generally bewildered by the sudden interruption and the cut to \"Cheers\", not knowing about the show's cancellation until it was widely reported by the Australian media outlets the next day.\n\nThe day after the special aired, a furious Packer showed up at Nine's headquarters and held meetings in which he loudly berated Nine's managers and censors, referring to the program as \"disgusting and offensive shit.\" After these meetings, Mulray and many of the staff who were involved with the creation of the special were fired, with Mulray being banned for life from Channel Nine. \n\nOn his radio show the next day, Mulray commented, \"I am the first man in Australian history to be pulled off by Kerry Packer.\" \n\nMulray returned to Nine to be a judge on the 2005 series \"StarStruck\" shortly after Packer's death on December 26 of that year.\n\nIn 2008, a full copy of the show was located by Nine's head of factual television. \n\nIt was aired in its entirety at 8:30 PM on 28 August 2008, one week short of sixteen years after the original special, and at the same time. Promoted as \"the show Kerry Packer didn't want you to see\", it featured commentary from Bert Newton; Packer had died in December 2005, and Mulray refused Nine's request to host the special.\n\nThe special was interrupted by the Channel Nine bumper and \"technical difficulties\" announcement 36 minutes in, cutting to the \"Cheers\" opening credits before resuming to a monologue by Newton, and the latter part of the special that never aired. The re-airing was censored, with portions of Mulray's monologues (including jibes about \"fat kids\") being cut from the special as they were deemed to be \"no longer acceptable\".\n\n"}

{"id": "51291561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51291561", "title": "Candle Cove", "text": "Candle Cove\n\nCandle Cove is a creepypasta online horror story written by webcartoonist and author Kris Straub in 2009. The story centers on a fictional television series, also titled Candle Cove, that could only be viewed by a small group of people, predominantly children, who later recall the disturbing show on a web forum. \n\nStraub has stated that he was inspired to write the creepypasta after reading \"Area 36-Year-Old Still Has Occasional \"Lidsville\" Nightmare\", an article published via the satirical news outlet \"The Onion\". Straub's story quickly became popular, inspiring numerous YouTube videos, and fan-fictions. In 2015 Straub self-published \"Candle Cove\" in a collection of short stories entitled \"Candle Cove and Other Stories\". The Verge commented that \"Candle Cove\" differed from other creepypastas in that while most creepypasta have an \"anonymous folkloric quality\", \"Candle Cove\"'s originated from a known source and author.\n\nA television adaptation, \"\", premiered on Syfy on October 11, 2016.\n\nThe story is told via a thread on a forum called the \"NetNostalgia Forums\", where a group of users discuss an unusual television show, \"Candle Cove\". The show is about a young girl named Janice, who imagines herself to be friends with pirates. The pirate characters are said to be portrayed by puppets. \n\nAs the users continue to reminisce they begin to recall more disturbing details about the show, such as a character known as the \"Skin-Taker\", a skeleton pirate who wears clothing made out of children's skin, and an episode that consisted entirely of the puppets flailing and screaming. The story closes with a user stating that they had recently visited their mother, who revealed that during the times the user said they were watching \"Candle Cove\", all the mother saw on the TV was static.\n\nIn 2015 the SyFy Channel announced their intent to adapt the \"Candle Cove\" story as the first season of a newly announced series, \"Channel Zero\". The season, named after the creepypasta, expands on the story and centers on a child psychologist who has returned home in order to investigate the 1980s disappearances of his brother and other children. \"Channel Zero: Candle Cove\" stars Paul Schneider and Fiona Shaw, and premiered on October 11, 2016.\n\nWill Wiles of \"Aeon\" wrote that \"Candle Cove\" was \"among the best creepypastas out there\" and a good example of using the messageboard and forum format as a storytelling tactic. The Verge has written praise for the creepypasta, stating that it was \"a perfectly dark spin on our nostalgia for the half-remembered stories of our childhood, that realization that the things we liked as kids were much, much creepier than we thought.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "19775880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19775880", "title": "Congress of the People (South African political party)", "text": "Congress of the People (South African political party)\n\nThe Congress of the People (COPE) is a South African political party formed in 2008 by former members of the African National Congress (ANC). The party was founded by former ANC members Mosiuoa Lekota, Mbhazima Shilowa and Mluleki George to contest the 2009 general election. The party was announced following a national convention held in Sandton on 1 November 2008, and was founded at a congress held in Bloemfontein on 16 December 2008. The name echoes the 1955 Congress of the People at which the Freedom Charter was adopted by the ANC and other parties, a name strongly contested by the ANC in a legal move dismissed by the Pretoria High Court.\n\nIn the 2009 general election, the party received 1,311,027 votes and a 7.42% share of the vote. Following the 2009 elections, COPE experienced a leadership dispute between factions supporting Mosiuoa Lekota and others supporting Mbhazima Shilowa, that led to a 2013 court battle, and continued into 2014. After the 2014 election, COPE was left with only three seats in the National Assembly, down from 30 seats in 2009.\n\nDespite its reduced stature, the party has joined with the much larger Democratic Alliance (DA) and several other smaller parties to co-govern Nelson Mandela Bay, Johannesburg and Tshwane after the 2016 municipal elections. \n\nThe birth of the party can be traced back to the 52nd ANC national conference held at Polokwane in December 2007. The conference resulted in the election of Jacob Zuma and his supporters, ahead of Thabo Mbeki and his supporters, to the ANC's governing body, the National Executive Committee. Zuma was elected ANC president ahead of Mbeki. The conference highlighted the different factions within the ANC and brought to the fore the diametrically opposed philosophies between Mbeki and Zuma. This included differences in both style and economic policy – the former pursued neoliberal economic policies and was known for an aloof personality and plotting against his political opponents, while his successor is more left-wing and populist, and has a closer relationship with the South African Communist Party and Congress of South African Trade Unions. The split also revealed underlying ethnic tensions between Zulu and Xhosa speakers, represented by Jacob Zuma and Thabo Mbeki respectively, as they jostled for political predominance.\n\nJacob Zuma, now elected president of the ANC and ANC candidate for President in the South Africa at the 2009 election, was facing corruption charges in relation to a multi-billion rand arms deal with French manufacturer Thint. Zuma had previously been dismissed by Mbeki as South Africa's vice-president at the start of the arms deal trial.\n\nIn 2008 a landmark ruling by high court judge Chris Nicholson found that the re-charging of Zuma by the National Prosecuting Authority was illegal and was unduly influenced by Mbeki due to political motives. The case against Zuma was thus dismissed. As a consequence of the judge's findings of political interference, the ANC's National Executive Committee requested the recall of Mbeki as the country's president. Mbeki tendered his resignation on 21 September 2008 and the resignation became official on 25 September. Many members of Mbeki's cabinet resigned their posts at the same time in solidarity, including vice-president Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and other senior cabinet ministers.\n\nThe recall of Mbeki brought to the fore simmering tensions within the ANC. On 23 September Mosiuoa Lekota announced that he had served the ANC with \"divorce papers\" and on 8 October announced that a national convention would be held to discuss the future of South African politics and the possible formation of a new political movement.\n\nLekota's call resounded with many Mbeki supporters who started handing in their resignations to the ANC to join Lekota's movement. Notable resignations include those of former Gauteng premier Mbhazima Shilowa, former Western Cape minister of safety and security Leonard Ramatlakane and Mluleki George. Across the country many regular ANC members also handed in their resignations in public demonstrations, burning their ANC membership cards. The resignation movement resounded particularly in provinces in which there were already splits in the ANC structure, such as the Western Cape.\n\nThe convention called by Lekota was held in Sandton on 1 November 2008. Planned for 4,000 delegates over two days, the conference eventually hosted over 5,000, with some people not able to get into the venue, and was shortened to one day to avoid inconvenience to those delegates who had nowhere to stay overnight.\nThe conference was attended by major political figures, including delegates from other political parties. The ANC did not send a delegation to the conference.\n\nFollowing the conference Lekota announced that a new party would be formed on 16 December. In Western Cape municipal by-elections on 11 December 2008, COPE won 10 of 27 wards (with its candidates running as independents, as it was not yet registered); the ANC won only three wards, with twelve of its candidates disqualified due to missing the registration deadline. The DA won nine seats.\n\nThe party was formally launched at a three-day conference from 14 to 16 December 2008, at which Lekota was named president.\n\nThe party faced its first general election in 2009. Their election manifesto was launched on 24 January 2009 and included calls for electoral reform to have the president, provincial premiers and municipal mayors directly elected. South Africa currently has a pure proportional representation system with parties submitting lists of candidates in order of preference. The president and provincial premiers and mayors (after municipal elections) are subsequently elected by the members of the relevant assembly.\n\nOn 20 February 2009, they announced clergyman Mvume Dandala as their presidential candidate. A COPE official was murdered in the Eastern Cape, and COPE supporters, from the Eastern Cape, were driven out of their shacks in Durban. The party achieved the leadership of the opposition in the legislatures of Eastern Cape, Free State, Limpopo and Northern Cape and representation in all nine provinces.\n\n!Election\n!Total votes\n!Share of vote\n!Seats \n!Government\n!2009\n!2014\n\n!rowspan=2|Election\n!colspan=2|Eastern Cape\n!colspan=2|Free State\n!colspan=2|Gauteng\n!colspan=2|Kwazulu-Natal\n!colspan=2|Limpopo\n!colspan=2|Mpumalanga\n!colspan=2|North-West\n!colspan=2|Northern Cape\n!colspan=2|Western Cape\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!%!!Seats\n!2009\n!2014\n\n!Election\n!Votes\n!2011\n!2016\n\nThe elected leadership of the party consists of the following:\n\nCOPE's list of provincial premiership candidates was announced in the Sunday Sun newspaper on 2 March 2009. The list was:\n\n\nThe premiership candidate for Limpopo was announced at a later date:\n\n\nThe ANC leadership reacted by offering a reconciliation meeting between treasurer Mathews Phosa and Lekota and his former deputy defense minister Mluleki George on 13 October. However, the meeting ended without resolution. On 14 October, Lekota and George were suspended from membership in the ANC by the National Executive Committee, with threats of suspension against any other members who sought to join Lekota and George. Both Zuma and then ANC Youth League president Julius Malema ridiculed Lekota for the announcement.\n\nOn 15 October, former Gauteng premier Mbhazima Shilowa, who resigned from his position soon after Mbeki and the cabinet resigned, announced that he had resigned his membership from the ANC and thrown his support behind Lekota's convention, which he announced would be held on 2 November. The partnership between Lekota and Shilowa led the press to nickname the proposed new party \"Shikota\". Former Western Cape community safety minister Leonard Ramatlakane resigned from the ANC on 22 October to join Lekota's initiative. On 3 November, former Eastern Cape premier Nosimo Balindlela announced her resignation from the ANC in order to join the proposed new party.\n\nOn 13 November 2008, Smuts Ngonyama, the former head of communications for ANC, joined the breakaway movement.\n\nHelen Zille of the Democratic Alliance, Bantu Holomisa of the United Democratic Movement and Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom Party all welcomed the announcement, saying that a new party in opposition to the ANC would diversify the political landscape and pull South Africa from being an effectively dominant-party system.\n\nCOPE has attracted the support of a wide range of well-known South Africans from various sectors, including Sipho Ngwema, former head of communications for the Scorpions who is now the party's media liaison chief, and cleric Allan Boesak who ran in the 2009 election as COPE's Western Cape premier candidate. Other prominent supporters include the wife of Vusi Pikoli, the former head of the National Prosecuting Authority, and Simon Grindrod, former deputy president of the Independent Democrats.\n\nPhumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, former deputy president under Thabo Mbeki, and Saki Macozoma, a prominent South African billionnaire and close ally of Mbeki, joined COPE in late February 2009. Macozoma's affiliation to the party was accidentally leaked by Mbhazima Shilowa himself in London, United Kingdom, in the third week of January 2009 Mlambo-Ngcuka who is best known for her statement that South Africa could learn from Zimbabwe with regard to land reform.\n\nIn an interview with \"The Sunday Times\", Lekota stated that the ideology of the party will be one that embraces multiracial and multicultural participation in governance, promoting of the free market and disavowed themselves from any connection to Marxism. He has also indicated that the party would be willing to ally itself with the Democratic Alliance, a historically liberal party, in the case that the DA ever enters government.\n\nAccording to the party's manifesto flyer, COPE's campaign topics for the 2009 elections are maintaining the constitutional status quo, unemployment, job satisfaction, poverty, the environment, secondary and tertiary education, health care in general, crime, women empowerment, youth development, family values, and future non-racialism.\n\nA main distinction between COPE and the ruling ANC party is that COPE favours a system in which top-level government officials are elected directly, by public election, and officials can be removed only by courts of justice, whereas the current situation in South Africa is that top-level government officials are appointed and can be removed from office by the political parties themselves.\n\nBefore settling on the name \"Congress of the People\" and the abbreviation \"COPE\", several possible names were used or suggested by the party founders themselves and through speculation in the media.\n\nDuring a public meeting on 12 October 2008 in Langa, where Lekota was the speaker, membership forms for a possible new party, bearing the name \"African National Congress of South Africa (ANCSA)\", were distributed.\n\nOn 31 October 2008, one day prior to the new party's convention in Sandton, the ANC made an urgent application to the high court to prevent the new party from using names such as \"South Africa National Convention\", \"South Africa National Congress\", \"SANC\" or any other name or trademark that is similar to its own. The judge ruled that the convention may go ahead, but did make a ruling on the names issue until 6 November.\n\nAt the new party's Sandton convention, the name \"South African Democratic Congress (SADC)\" was also proposed, but it was later discovered by them that this was already being used by another party that was due to contest the 2009 election.\n\nBy 15 November, the name \"Congress of the People\" was chosen, and its official abbreviation was chosen to be \"COPE\", not \"COP\".\n\nWhen the name settled on was the \"Congress of the People\", the ANC announced they would challenge this name as well. The ANC's application to the Pretoria Provincial Division of the High Court for an interdict to prevent COPE from using the name Congress of the People, cited that the ANC itself was affiliated to the 1955 Congress of the People, held in Kliptown. On 12 December 2008, the court ruled that COPE would not be barred from using its present name.\n\nThe elevation of Boesak to the COPE leadership, given his record as a convicted malefactor, drew considerable censure from press and public alike. It was intimated that the party's self-projection as a morally pure alternative had been sullied. On 5 February 2009, on his Facebook page, Lekota urged supporters:\n\nWe should also not be distracted now by who serves in the interim leadership, because ultimately the people's voice will be heard. They will vote for their leaders, and everyone else will apply for a job and be interviewed to obtain any position. So, you see, I am not bothered by who joins COPE, or if the individual has a criminal record, or not. Is it not so, that if a gangster goes to church, he expects to dance to gospel music, not kwaito?

Vogel identifies the roots of the pious fraud in the conflict between members of the Smith family, who were divided between the skepticism and universalism of Joseph Smith, Sr., and the more mainstream Protestant faith of Lucy Mack Smith. Vogel interweaves the history of Joseph Smith with interpretation of the Book of Mormon, which is read as springing from the young man's psychology and experiences.\n\nVogel's scholarship on the topic has been debated by Mormon apologists and scholars who have stated that he is critical of Mormon faith claims. He has also been criticized by ex-Mormons and anti-Mormons for not being sufficiently critical of Joseph Smith. Larry Morris praised his efforts to produce the multi-volume \"Early Mormon Documents\".\n\nVogel has also edited volumes skeptical of the possibility of receiving the future through the word of God. \n\nMany of Vogel's books have been critically reviewed by members of FARMS.

And secondly, they can see themselves passively looking from the house at the person outside the fence, doing nothing to remove this segregation.\n\nThe concept of this project is to bring to the attention of people living in the 'free' world that many of the boundaries that segregate others in a 'non free' world, are created by themselves.

{"id": "2234574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2234574", "title": "Epilogue", "text": "Epilogue\n\nAn epilogue or epilog (from Greek ἐπίλογος \"epílogos\", \"conclusion\" from ἐπί \"epi\", \"in addition\" and λόγος \"logos\", \"word\") is a piece of writing at the end of a work of literature, usually used to bring closure to the work. It is presented from the perspective of within the story. When the author steps in and speaks indirectly to the reader, that is more properly considered an afterword. The opposite is a prologue—a piece of writing at the \"beginning\" of a work of literature or drama, usually used to open the story and capture interest. Some genres, for example television programs and video games, call the epilog an \"outro\" patterned on the use of \"intro\" for \"introduction\".\n\nAn epilogue is the final chapter at the end of a story that often serves to reveal the fates of the characters. Some epilogues may feature scenes only tangentially related to the subject of the story. They can be used to hint at a sequel or wrap up all the loose ends. They can occur at a significant period of time after the main plot has ended. In some cases, the epilogue is used to allow the main character a chance to \"speak freely\".\n\nAn epilogue can continue in the same narrative style and perspective as the preceding story, although the form of an epilogue can occasionally be drastically different from the overall story. It can also be used as a sequel.\n\nIn films, the final scenes may feature a montage of images or clips with a short explanation of what happens to the characters. A few examples of such films are \"9 to 5\", \"American Graffiti\", \"National Lampoon's Animal House\", \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2\", \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\", \"Remember the Titans\", and \"Changeling\".\n\nThere are many films which do not only include a few glimpses of the character's future, but also are based on an epilogue. Most epilogues in films are shown in a dramatic fashion, usually in silence, to commemorate an important happening, for example, the fate of a character in the film.\n\nThe epilogue of \"La La Land\" shows a happy ending, an alternative to the actual ending. \n\nIn many documentaries and biopics, the epilogue is text-based, explaining what happened to the subjects after the events covered in the film.\n\nIn video gaming, epilogues can occur at the end of the story, usually after the credits have rolled. An epilogue in a game functions similarly to an epilogue in film and literature, providing closure to the end of a story.\n\nHowever, the way in which an epilogue is interacted with in a video game can then determine how a story ends, in works of fiction that contain multiple endings. For example, there are four possible endings to \"\", and three of the endings are chosen by what the player does in the epilogue.\n\nIn games that feature the permanent death of playable characters, an epilogue can chronicle what has happened to the various characters that have survived the events of the game, depicting how their situation has changed after the story has come to a conclusion. For example, the 2015 video game \"Until Dawn\" features those who survived recounting their experiences to the Police after being rescued. This system can also be expanded on. In most games of the \"Fire Emblem\" series, relationships can be built between characters, allowing for unique outcomes to happen for characters depending on the actions of the player throughout the campaign.\n\nA visual novel can also feature a type of epilogue, which will wrap up all of the scenarios encountered by a player, most often after the game has been fully completed by reaching all of the multiple endings; as is the case with \"Tsukihime\", featuring an epilogue that expands on the endings of all completable routes, as well as providing context for the rest of the game by explaining events in the prologue.\n\nFor many years \"The Epilogue\", a reflective 5-minute sermonette, was the last programme of the day broadcast on a Sunday evening by BBC radio and later television. The format was picked up by the independent broadcaster ITV in 1956 and was adopted across its various franchises until 1988.\n\n"}

{"id": "302776", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=302776", "title": "Float glass", "text": "Float glass\n\nFloat glass is a sheet of glass made by floating molten glass on a bed of molten metal, typically tin, although lead and various low melting point alloys were used in the past. This method gives the sheet uniform thickness and very flat surfaces. \n\nModern windows are made from float glass. Most float glass is soda-lime glass, but relatively minor quantities of specialty borosilicate and flat panel display glass are also produced using the float glass process. The float glass process is also known as the Pilkington process, named after the British glass manufacturer Pilkington, which pioneered the technique (invented by Sir Alastair Pilkington) in the 1950s at their production site in St Helens, Merseyside.\n\nUntil the 16th century, window glass or flat glass was generally cut from large discs (or rondels) of crown glass. Larger sheets of glass were made by blowing large cylinders which were cut open and flattened, then cut into panes. Most window glass in the early 19th century was made using the cylinder method. The 'cylinders' were long and in diameter, limiting the width that panes of glass could be cut, and resulting in windows divided by transoms into rectangular panels.\n\nThe first advances in automating glass manufacturing were patented in 1848 by Henry Bessemer, an English engineer. His system produced a continuous ribbon of flat glass by forming the ribbon between rollers. This was an expensive process, as the surfaces of the glass needed polishing. If the glass could be set on a perfectly smooth, flat body, like the surface of an open pan of calm liquid, this would reduce costs considerably. Attempts were made to form flat glass on a bath of molten tin—one of the few liquids denser than glass that would be calm at the high temperatures needed to make glass—most notably in the US. Several patents were granted, but this process was unworkable at the time.\n\nBefore the development of float glass, larger sheets of plate glass were made by casting a large puddle of glass on an iron surface, and then polishing both sides, a costly process. From the early 1920s, a continuous ribbon of plate glass was passed through a lengthy series of inline grinders and polishers, reducing glass losses and cost.\n\nGlass of lower quality, drawn glass, was made by drawing upwards from a pool of molten glass a thin sheet, held at the edges by rollers. As it cooled the rising sheet stiffened and could then be cut. The two surfaces were of lower quality i.e. not as smooth or uniform as those of float glass. This process continued in use for many years after the development of float glass.\n\nBetween 1953 and 1957, Sir Alastair Pilkington and Kenneth Bickerstaff of the UK's Pilkington Brothers developed the first successful commercial application for forming a continuous ribbon of glass using a molten tin bath on which the molten glass flows unhindered under the influence of gravity. The success of this process lay in the careful balance of the volume of glass fed onto the bath, where it was flattened by its own weight. Full scale profitable sales of float glass were first achieved in 1960.\n\nIn 1964, CH3 Tank, the first purpose-built float line in the world, was built after the conversion of CH4 Tank. CH1 Tank closed down in 1977 as CH2 Float Line started up. The Pilkington's production line at Cowley Hill, St Helens, the birthplace of float glass, is no longer in operation as of 2014 although Pilkington continue to operate other float glass facilities within the town.\n\nFloat glass uses common glass-making raw materials, typically consisting of sand, soda ash (sodium carbonate), dolomite, limestone, and salt cake (sodium sulfate) etc. Other materials may be used as colourants, refining agents or to adjust the physical and chemical properties of the glass. The raw materials are mixed in a batch process, then fed together with suitable cullet (waste glass), in a controlled ratio, into a furnace where it is heated to approximately 1500 °C. Common flat glass furnaces are 9 m wide, 45 m long, and contain more than 1200 tons of glass. Once molten, the temperature of the glass is stabilised to approximately 1200 °C to ensure a homogeneous specific gravity.\n\nThe molten glass is fed into a \"tin bath\", a bath of molten tin (about 3–4 m wide, 50 m long, 6 cm deep), from a delivery canal and is poured into the tin bath by a ceramic lip known as the spout lip. The amount of glass allowed to pour onto the molten tin is controlled by a gate called a \"tweel\".\n\nTin is suitable for the float glass process because it has a high specific gravity, is cohesive, and is immiscible with molten glass. Tin, however, oxidises in a natural atmosphere to form tin dioxide (SnO). Known in the production process as dross, the tin dioxide adheres to the glass. To prevent oxidation, the tin bath is provided with a positive pressure protective atmosphere of nitrogen and hydrogen.\n\nThe glass flows onto the tin surface forming a floating ribbon with perfectly smooth surfaces on both sides and of even thickness. As the glass flows along the tin bath, the temperature is gradually reduced from 1100 °C until at approximately 600 °C the sheet can be lifted from the tin onto rollers. The glass ribbon is pulled off the bath by rollers at a controlled speed. Variation in the flow speed and roller speed enables glass sheets of varying thickness to be formed. Top rollers positioned above the molten tin may be used to control both the thickness and the width of the glass ribbon.\n\nOnce off the bath, the glass sheet passes through a lehr kiln for approximately 100 m, where it is cooled gradually so that it anneals without strain and does not crack from the temperature change. On exiting the \"cold end\" of the kiln, the glass is cut by machines.\n\nToday, float glass is the most widely used form of glass in consumer products. Due to both its high quality with no additional polishing required and its structural flexibility during production, it can easily be shaped and bent into a variety of forms while in a heated, syrupy state. This makes it ideal for a variety of applications such as\n\n\nMost forms of specialized glass such as toughened glass, frosted glass, laminated safety glass and soundproof glass consist of standard float glass that has been further processed.\n\nAs of 2009, the world float glass market, not including China and Russia, is dominated by the four companies: Asahi Glass, NSG/Pilkington, Saint-Gobain, and Guardian Industries. Other companies include Sise Cam AS, PPG, Central Glass, Hankuk (HanGlas), Zeledyne, and Cardinal Glass Industries.\n\n\n"}

For an approximately forty-year period he worked in the Upper-Tonkin Vicariate, Hainan, and Laos. He studied the Hmong people of northern Vietnam and Laos as he was asked to spread Christianity to them. Nicholas Tapp, author of \"The Impossibility of Self: An Essay on the Hmong Diaspora\", described Savina as \"One of our earliest informants who is at all frank about the nature of his day-today encounters with the Hmong\". Charles Keith, author of \"Catholic Vietnam: A Church from Empire to Nation\", wrote that Savina was \"[t]he most notable\" missionary ethnographer of Southeast Asia of his era.\n\nTapp wrote that \"Savina spoke Hmong but we do not know how much\". Savina also had studied Chinese. Robert Entenmann, author of \"The Myth of Sonom, the Hmong King,\" wrote that Savina \"was unfamiliar with Chinese history and the subtleties of Chinese vocabulary\".\n\nHe was born in Brittany, France. In 1901 he arrived in Tonkin after having joined the Société des Missions-Etrangères de Paris (MEP). He was 25 years old at the time.\n\nInitially Savina worked with Hmong in Lào Cai, Vietnam. From 1906 to 1925 Savina worked with the Hmong people in Yunnan, China, and also with Hmong in northern French Indochina. From 1918 to 1921 Savina had an official assignment in Laos. Beginning in 1925 he worked as an ethnographic field research representative of the École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO). During that assignment he was based in Hainan and made frequent trips to Hong Kong where he interacted with a printing house of the MEP. This assignment ended in 1928.\n\nHe resumed his missionary activities in 1939 and moved to Ha Giang in Upper Tonkin. He was hospitalized in Hanoi after he came down with pneumonia in March 1941. At age 65 he died on July 23 of that year.\n\nSavina collected his own data to build eight dictionaries of languages of Southeast Asia, including those in highland and lowland areas. The dictionaries and four lexicons he wrote combined have a total of over 5,000 pages; these were published from 1911 to 1939. Savina also wrote histories and ethnographic texts. Many of his works are about the Hmong people. Savina's publications discuss the Ao, Be, Chinese, Day, Hiai, Hoklo, Miao, Nung, Tay, and Vietnamese languages. His works appeared in academic journals of the era.\n\nSavina wrote \"Histoire des Miao\", published in 1924, and \"Monographie de Hainan\" (\"Monograph of Hainan Island\"), published in 1929. Of Savina's writings, \"Histoire des Miao\" is the most well-known and the most often cited.

William Skinner\n\nGeorge William Skinner (; February 14, 1925 – October 26, 2008) was an American anthropologist and scholar of China. Skinner was a proponent of the spatial approach to Chinese history, as explained in his Presidential Address to the Association for Asian Studies in 1984. He often referred to his approach as \"regional analysis,\" and taught the use of maps as a key class of data in ethnography.\n\nSkinner was born on February 14, 1925, in Oakland, California. His father, John James Skinner was a pharmacologist and his mother, Eunice Engle Skinner, taught music and became the director of music education for the Berkeley school system. Skinner spent two years at Deep Springs College, a small college founded to educate small cohorts of young men into the life of the mind in a self-sufficient, disciplined manner. After Deep Springs, he joined the Navy V-12 Program in 1943, then attended the U.S. Navy Oriental Language School for 18 months at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where he studied Chinese. In 1946, Skinner headed for Cornell University to complete his B.A. degree. He graduated in the following year with his B.A. (with distinction) in Far Eastern Studies, and remained there for his Ph.D. in anthropology (1954) under the supervision of Lauriston Sharp.\n\nSkinner’s first job was as instructor in sociology at Cornell in 1949. Late in that year he flew to Chengdu, in China's Sichuan province, to conduct doctoral dissertation research on the structure of markets in the Chengdu Plain. Skinner's research was cut short by the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, which confiscated his notes, but the experience became the basis of his later work on spatial modelling. Skinner proceeded to Bangkok, Thailand, where he researched a substitute doctoral topic, the social structure of the Chinese community in Thailand. This research was published in his first two books, \"Chinese Society in Thailand\" (1957) and \"Leadership and Power in the Chinese Community of Thailand\" (1958) \n\nBetween 1951 and 1955, he was field director of the Cornell Southeast Asia Program, then a research associate at Cornell. He became assistant professor of anthropology at Columbia University in 1958. Two years later, Skinner was hired back at Cornell as associate professor and then promoted to full professor in 1962 — an unusually fast track to that status. In 1965, he left for Stanford University, moving again in 1990 to the University of California, Davis, which had hired his wife, China historian Susan L. Mann. Skinner retired from teaching in 2005 but maintained an active research program until his death three years later.\n\nPerhaps his best-known influence on Chinese Studies was his delineation of the Physiographic macroregions of China. In later years he was instrumental in the establishment of the China Historical Geographic Information Systems project at Harvard and Fudan Universities. His papers and maps are archived in the library collections of Harvard, Cornell, the University of Washington, and Fudan University.\n\nBooks and monographs\n\nArticles and book chapters\n\n"}

It corresponds to the latest stages of the Natufian culture. Like the Natufian, it is characterized by semi-subterranean houses. These are often more elaborate than those found at Natufian sites. For the first time arrowheads are found among the stone tool kit. \n\nAndy Burns states \"The Harifian dates to between approximately 10,800/10,500bp and 10,000/10,200bp. It is restricted to the Sinai and Negev, and is probably broadly contemporary with the Late Natufian or Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. \n\nMicrolithic points are a characteristic feature of the industry, with the Harif point being both new and particularly diagnostic – Bar-Yosef (1998) suggests that it is an indication of improved hunting techniques. Lunates, isosceles and other triangular forms were backed with retouch, and some Helwan lunates are found. This industry contrasts with the Desert Natufian which did not have the roughly triangular points in its assemblage.\n\nThere are two main groups within the Harifian. One group consists of ephemeral base camps in the north of Sinai and western Negev, where stone points comprise up to 88% of all microliths, accompanied by only a few lunates and triangles. The other group consists of base camps and smaller campsites in the Negev and features a greater number of lunates and triangles than points. These sites probably represent functional rather than chronological differences. The presence of Khiam points in some sites indicates that there was communication with other areas in the Levant at this time.\"\n\nHarifian has close connections with the late Mesolithic cultures of Fayyum and the Eastern Deserts of Egypt, whose tool assemblage resembles that of the Harifian. Fusion with animal domestication elements of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) culture is hypothesised by Juris Zarins, to have led to the Circum Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, a group of cultures that invented nomadic pastoralism, and may have been the original culture which spread Proto-Semitic languages throughout the region.\n\n"}

They are referred to as the twins, without letting the audience know their gender. The twins get mentioned several times over two years, when Helena arrives at Castle Königsbrunn and gives one of the twins a face and a name. With her appearance it has been declared that she has a twin brother named Tristan (Jens Hartwig). Before Helena comes to Königsbrunn a box with Asian art has been sent to the Lahnstein family. While wondering what is in the box, Helena opens the door and is welcomed by her brother Sebastian and younger sister Rebecca. When the butler of the aristocratic family looks a little bit lost at the situation Elisabeth von Lahnstein is the first to introduce Helena as Sebastian and Rebecca's sibling.\n\nHelena is described as a happy and cheerful person. She studies archeology at the University of Heidelberg and comes after a long time abroad to meet her siblings at Königsbrunn. From the beginning it is mentioned that she is extremely close to her twin brother Tristan and cannot be anywhere long without him. The relationship between brother and sister seems almost incestuous. It is mentioned by Rebecca that Tristan and Helena can not be without each other and that they forget the world around them when they are together. Not long after Helena's arrival she has to call Tristan and tell him that she misses and loves him. When it is mentioned that Tristan is spending time with Tanja, Helena seems almost jealous and tells Rebecca that it will not last for long anyway.\n\nHelena was born to Ludwig von Lahnstein and is one of his five children. Ludwig married a maid, Madeleine, which upset his father deeply. This leads to Ludwig being disowned and his brother Johannes becoming the heir to the Lahnstein fortune. Ludwig, his wife and his children leave Königsbrunn, while Johannes tries to stop his brother and giving him his heritage. But an angry Ludwig leaves and breaks off contact with his family. It has been mentioned that Ludwig and his family moved abroad. When Ludwig and his wife both die, Ludwig's good friend Adrian Degenhardt takes care of his children. He finances their education and becomes a surrogate father to them. Helena and Tristan travel abroad, while Sebastian and Rebecca have been staying in the United States, before the family reunite after years at Castle Königsbrunn.\n\nHelena has not been to Königsbrunn since she was a little girl. She's welcome by Rebecca and Sebastian, and wants to spend as much time as possible with her sister since it has been a long time since they last saw each other. Helena discovers that Rebecca has been lying about her job, and actually she has money troubles and is unemployed. Helena tries to comfort Rebecca, when Elisabeth mentions an article about Helena's latest success in her career; leading Rebecca to be jealous of her sister's success.\n\nHelena quickly falls in love with Andi Fritzsche and they become a couple. Their relationship survives several tests, behind of most of which is Tristan, who can't accept that his sister is close to another man. However, they break up for good after Helena discover Andi had a drunk one-night stand with Jessica Stiehl, who had previously accused him of rape trying to break them up.\n\nLater, Helena hits Philipp zu Hohenfelden with her car and is sentenced to do community service in a Düsseldorf hospital, where she meets Andi's brother Daniel, and they start a relationship.

Campbell bibliography\n\nThis is a bibliography of works by American writer John W. Campbell, Jr.\n\nThe bibliography is in chronological order of first publication of the books. In most cases only first editions are shown for each title, with the following exceptions. Both British and US editions are shown for \"Who Goes There?\" as the title was changed. \"The Moon is Hell\" was released both as a novel and a short story collection; both versions are shown. Some confusing variants are shown in full for the \"Astounding Science Fiction Anthology\" and its derivatives; the situation is explained more fully in that section. Some other variant titles are listed separately, with notes indicating what the original titles were.\n\nThe main bibliographic sources are footnoted from this paragraph and provided much of the information in the following sections. Some footnotes annotating specific points are provided at the appropriate places below.\n\n\nThe Nicholls Encyclopedia mentions a 1952 chapbook, published in Australia, as the first edition of \"Who Goes There?\" as a standalone novel, but provides no bibliographic details. The story itself first saw book form in the 1948 Shasta collection; see below.\n\n\n\n\nThe situation with regard to \"The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology\" and its reprints is confusing enough to warrant a separate discussion. The original anthology, published by Simon & Schuster in 1952, contained 23 stories, and an introduction by Campbell. There have been three separate reissues of these stories in two volumes. The first was done by Grayson & Grayson, in 1954, as \"The First Astounding Science Fiction Anthology\" (seven stories) and \"The Second Science Fiction Anthology\" (eight stories). This selection omitted the introduction (as did all the later editions) and also omitted eight of the stories. Then in 1956 and 1957 Berkley issued two paperback selections. The first, with serial number G-41, had the same title as the original, 'The Astounding Science Fiction Anthology', but included only eight stories. This was re-released in 1967 under the title \"Selections From the Astounding Science Fiction Anthology\". The second Berkley anthology, which had serial number G-47, was \"Astounding Tales of Space and Time\"; this selected another seven stories; again eight stories were omitted, although not the same eight as omitted by the Grayson books: Berkley included five stories not printed in the Grayson versions of the anthology, and omitted five that Grayson did print. Finally, in 1964 and 1965, Four Square printed a third version, again in two volumes, and with the same titles as the Grayson books: \"The First Astounding Science Fiction Anthology\" and \"The Second Astounding Science Fiction Anthology\". The first volume contained eleven stories, and the second twelve stories; this version reprinted everything from the original 1952 one-volume edition except for Campbell's introduction.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35035141", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35035141", "title": "Language deprivation", "text": "Language deprivation\n\nLanguage deprivation is associated with the lack of linguistic stimuli that are necessary for the language acquisition processes in an individual. Research has shown that early exposure to a first language will predict future language outcomes. Experiments involving language deprivation are very scarce due to the ethical controversy associated with it. Roger Shattuck, an American writer, called language deprivation research \"The Forbidden Experiment\" because it required the deprivation of a normal human. Similarly, experiments were performed by depriving animals of social stimuli to examine psychosis. Although there has been no formal experimentation on this topic, there are several cases of language deprivation. The combined research on these cases has furthered the research in the critical period hypothesis in language acquisition.\n\nThe most well-documented case of a language-deprived child was that of Genie. Genie was discovered in 1971 in the family home, where she was recognized as highly abnormal. A social welfare agency took her into custody and admitted Genie into a hospital. Before discovery, Genie had lived strapped and harnessed into a chair. Genie, 13 years of age upon discovery, was malnourished, insensitive to tactile senses, and silent even upon being evoked; however she had proper social skills and she was able to maintain eye contact with caregivers, giving the impression that she understood instruction. After being discharged from the hospital she was put in foster care where she received \"informal\" training.\n\nThe first tests of language were taken three years after her discovery. She was given a variety of language test measures to test her sound skills, comprehension skills, and grammatical skills. She was able to discriminate between initial and final consonants. However, she lacked pitch and volume control, her speech was described as high pitched and breathy with sound distortions, consonant clusters, neutralizing vowels, dropping final consonants, and reducing consonants. She was able to comprehend instructions but was dependent on pantomime and gesture. Genie was capable of discriminating affirmation from negative, comparative adjectives, and colour words. After four years of language stimulation, her linguistic performance was similar to that of a normal two-year-old infant. She had poor performance in complex sentences, interchangeably used the pronouns \"you\" and \"me\", and lacked the question form of sentence structure. Further studies were conducted focusing on the physiological state of Genie. She was right-handed but neurological tests showed that she processed her language in the right hemisphere. Normally right-handed people process language in the left hemisphere. She excelled in right-hemisphere processed tasks, such as face perception, holistic recall of unrelated objects, and number perception. Genie's language skills were deemed as poor, and this was linked to the notion that she began to learn language when she was 13½.\n\nAnother case of language deprivation was of Kaspar Hauser, who was kept in a dungeon in Germany until the age of 17. He did have some contact with humans during his isolation. Sources stated that he had a small amount of language; other sources state that upon discovery he spoke a garbled sentence. He was able to learn enough language to attempt to write an autobiography and to also become a legal clerk. However, five years after discovery he was stabbed to death.\n\nAnna was born March 6, 1932, and was an illegitimate child. She was put in isolation by her mother because of this. Anna was kept tied to a chair and was malnourished due to being fed milk only. Upon discovery on February 6, 1938, she was sent to a county home. Further examination of Anna determined that she was very poor physiologically but that her senses were intact. During her stay at the county, she gained some body weight and began to build muscle in her body. She lived at the county home for nine months until she was moved to a foster home. Upon leaving she was still very unsocial, because there was no predetermined caregiver in the county home, which consisted of over 300 inmates and one nurse; often she was taken care of by inmates. The caregiver at the foster home used the same method to talk to Anna by which a mother would talk to their infant. During her tenure at the foster home she underwent some mental development and was similar to a one-year-old. After a year at the foster home she was sent to a school for defective children. Although she could not speak at the time, she had a comprehension of instructions.\n\nAnother case of a child deprived at a young age is that of Isabelle. Confined to a room with a deaf and mute mother, she spent 6½ years in silence without any language stimulation. Upon discovery she was sent to a hospital where she was monitored for her apathetic behaviour. Now in a ward with children, she began to imitate other children in the ward to request attention. She had also begun language training. Eighteen months into her training her repertoire of words was estimated to be 1500–2500 words; she was also able to produce complex sentence structures. Throughout her training she began to use correct inflectional morphology, pronouns, and prepositions.\n\nFeral children are children discovered by society to be living in the wild with the assumption that they were raised by animals. It is stated that such children are deprived of human associations and are too strongly conditioned with animal behaviours, such that the human development is permanently inhibited and the animal inhibitions are never lost throughout life. There are several known cases of feral children relearning language, the most well-known is Victor. Victor was found at the age of 13 and was given to Dr. Itard, who \"experimented\" on the child. Victor was also known as the \"wild boy of Aveyron\". He was characterized to be insensitive to temperature, uncivilized and to run on all fours. Dr. Jean Marc Gaspard Itard conducted training over a period of 5 years, during which time Victor was able to recover some speech.\n\nScientists suggest that the best guarantee of good language outcomes for Deaf children is to establish Sign Language as a secure first language before a cochlear implant program (CIP) is considered.\n\nBecause new hearing parents of deaf children are frequently advised by professionals without training in the field of language acquisition in deaf children, they are often advised to use sign as a last resort, only after the child has failed to learn spoken language. This subjects these children to language deprivation in the time before they are exposed to accessible language input, which has been shown to increase the likelihood of permanent, irreversible effects to their brains. These effects include not only a detrimental impact on language acquisition, but other cognitive and mental health difficulties as well.\n\nThe effects of language deprivation in deaf children, like hearing children, can include permanently affecting their ability to ever achieve proficiency in a language. Deaf children who do not learn to sign until later in life are more likely to process signed languages not as linguistic input, but as visual input, contrasting with children exposed from birth, who process signed language in the same region of the brain in which hearing people process spoken language. Additionally, studies show a notable decrease in sign language grammar skills of deaf adults who were not exposed to sign until after age 5 when compared to those exposed from birth, and an even greater decrease in those who were not exposed until after age 8, in some cases being so poor as to have near-coincidence levels of accuracy.\n\nThis effect extends to spoken language as well. One study comparing English-as-a-second-language speakers showed that while deaf children who are signed to from birth have similar proficiency in spoken English to hearing ESL speakers, Deaf children who were not exposed to sign until entering school show a marked reduction in English proficiency. Note that this last group had been exposed to spoken English from birth; however, since auditory input was inaccessible to them, they failed to acquire spoken English as their first language, and therefore did not acquire language at all until learning ASL upon entering school.\nWhile Cochlear implants may help in making spoken first language acquisition more possible, this effect is unreliable; children with Cochlear implants exposed only to spoken language can still show a serious lack of spoken language ability when compared to hearing peers. In contrast, implanted children exposed to signing from birth, a more accessible medium of language, do not show this deficiency, despite having spoken language as their second language. This suggests that even when implanted, the period of language deprivation prior to implantation is enough to seriously impact a child's language development.\n\nTo further understand the language deprivation within the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, two personal videos collected based on two Deaf people's experiences with being deprived of language have been included on this page with subtitles. In one video, Dan Foley explains how he was deprived of language outside of his immediate family members, especially at school. It was not until later when he had access to a language that he could understand and apply to his education. His story helps us to get a better perspective on where language deprivation can happen, even at school. In another video, Timothy Skaggs explains his experience being deprived of language at home and school. He explains how deprived he was from incidental learning because he had no direct communication with anyone except for his interpreters at school. He missed out on family gatherings, social cues, and a normal childhood in general because he was always the last to know everything because of his limited access to spoken English. For more extended information on both stories, refer to the videos on this page. If you want to learn more about language deprivation in deaf and hard-of-hearing children, refer to this page: Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children.\n\nThe \"critical period of learning\" hypothesis states that a person must be exposed to language by a certain age to acquire language. It is said to be associated with a period of increased neuroplasticity. It is also thought to end around the onset of puberty.\n\n"}

{"id": "38360894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38360894", "title": "Mood (literature)", "text": "Mood (literature)\n\nIn literature, mood is the atmosphere of the narrative. Mood is created by means of setting (locale and surroundings in which the narrative takes place), attitude (of the narrator and of the characters in the narrative), and descriptions. Though atmosphere and setting are connected, they may be considered separately to a degree. Atmosphere is the aura of mood that surrounds the story. It is to fiction what the sensory level is to poetry. Mood is established in order to affect the reader emotionally and psychologically and to provide a feeling for the narrative.\n\nMood is generally created through several different things.\nSetting, which provides the physical location of the story, is used in order to create a background in which the story takes place. Different settings can affect the mood of a story differently, and usually supports or conflicts with the other content of the story in some way. For example, the desert may be a setting for a cowboy story, and may generate a mood of solitude, desolation, and struggle, among other possible associations.\nThe attitude of the narrator is another element that helps generate mood. As the reader is dependent on the narrator's perspective of the story, they see the story through their lenses, feeling the way the narrator feels about what happens or what is being described. Embedded in the attitude of a narrator are the feelings and emotions which make it up. A similar element that goes into generating mood is diction, that is, the choice and style of words the writer uses. Diction conveys a sensibility as well as portrays the content of a story in specific colors, thus affecting the way the reader feels about it.\n\nTone and mood are not the same. The tone of a piece of literature is the speaker's or narrator's attitude towards the subject, rather than what the reader feels, as in mood. Mood is the general feeling or atmosphere that a piece of writing creates within the reader. Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, voice and tone. Tone can indicate the narrator's mood, but the overall mood comes from the totality of the written work, even in first-person narratives. The effect a literary work has upon the reader is subjective and produces different associations, while the text made by the author is presented to the reader as an objective thing. The mood is suggested by the elements utilized by the author, but relies on the subjective response from the reader.\n"}
{"id": "16741897", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16741897", "title": "Muraqqa", "text": "Muraqqa\n\nA Muraqqa (, , ) is an album in book form containing Islamic miniature paintings and specimens of Islamic calligraphy, normally from several different sources, and perhaps other matter. The album was popular among collectors in the Islamic world, and by the later 16th century became the predominant format for miniature painting in the Persian Safavid, Mughal and Ottoman empires, greatly affecting the direction taken by the painting traditions of the Persian miniature, Ottoman miniature and Mughal miniature. The album largely replaced the full-scale illustrated manuscript of classics of Persian poetry, which had been the typical vehicle for the finest miniature painters up to that time. The great cost and delay of commissioning a top-quality example of such a work essentially restricted them to the ruler and a handful of other great figures, who usually had to maintain a whole workshop of calligraphers, artists and other craftsmen, with a librarian to manage the whole process. An album could be compiled over time, page by page, and often included miniatures and pages of calligraphy from older books that were broken up for this purpose, and allowed a wider circle of collectors access to the best painters and calligraphers, although they were also compiled by, or presented to, shahs and emperors. The earliest \"muraqqa\" were of pages of calligraphy only; it was at the court in Herat of the Timurid prince Baysunghur in the early 15th century that the form became important for miniature painting. The word \"muraqqa\" means \"that which has been patched together\" in Persian.\n\nThe works in an album, typically of different original sizes, were trimmed or mounted on standard size pages, often with new border decoration being added. When the compilation was considered complete it was bound, often very luxuriously, with an Islamic book-cover that might be highly decorated with lacquered paint, gold stamping on leather, or other techniques. Other \"muraqqa\" might be bound in a special concertina-like form. Many were arranged with pages of calligraphy facing miniatures, the matching of verse to image allowing some scope for the creativity of the compiler. Albums containing only calligraphy tended to be arranged chronologically to show the development of a style. The bindings of many albums allowed items to be added and removed, or they were just removed from the centre of the page, and such changes were often made; some albums had marks which allow changes to be traced. The grandest albums had specially written prefaces which are the source of a high proportion of surviving contemporary writing on the arts of the book, and the biographies of painters and calligraphers; these tended to be written by calligraphers. For calligraphers too the single page for an album became the \"bread and butter\" source of income, using mostly texts from poetry, whether extracts from a long classic or ghazal lyrics, but sometimes an extract from the Qur'an, perhaps given the place of honour at the start of the album. Album pages often have areas of decorated illumination (as in the illustration) that share their motifs with other media, notably book-covers and carpet designs, the best of which were in fact probably mostly produced by the same type of artist at court, and sent to the weavers.\n\nWhile the classic Islamic illuminated manuscript tradition had concentrated on rather crowded scenes with strong narrative content as illustrations in full texts of classic and lengthy works like the \"Shahnameh\" and the \"Khamsa of Nizami\", the single miniature intended from the start for a \"muraqqa\" soon developed as a simpler scene with fewer, larger, figures, often showing idealized beauties of either sex in a garden setting, or genre figures from nomadic life, usually with no real or fictional identities attached to them. In Mughal India realistic portraiture, nearly always of rulers or courtiers, became a very common feature, and in Ottoman Turkey portraits of the Sultans, often very stylised, were a particular speciality. Fully coloured scenes tended to give way to part-drawn and part-painted ones, or to figures with little or no background. The album to some extent overlaps with the anthology, a collection of different pieces where the main emphasis is on the texts, but which can also include paintings and drawings inserted from different sources.\n\nThe dominant tradition of miniature painting in the late Middle Ages was that of Persia, which had a number of centres, but all usually dependent on one key patron, whether the shah himself, or a figure either governing a part of the country from a centre such as Herat, where Baysunghur was an important patron in the early 15th century, or the ruler of a further part of the Persianate world in a centre like Bukhara. As the Safavid dynasty centralized Persian rule in the 16th century the number of potential partrons of a full-size atelier declined, but the atelier of the shah expanded and produced a number of superb illustrated books, using a variety of very talented artists on each. However, in the 1540s Shah Tahmasp I, previously a keen patron, lost interest in commissioning books, and thereafter the Persian miniature painting tradition lacked a steady source of commissions for books in the old style. After a gap of some years, Tahmasp's nephew Ibrahim Mirza established an atelier at Mashad, which produced the Freer Jami in the 1560s, and which Shah Ismail II took over after having its former patron killed in 1577. But Ismail's reign was very brief, and thereafter consistent large-scale patronage was lacking. It was in this period that the single miniature designed for inserting in an album came to be dominant; such works had long been produced, but now they became the main source of income for many artists, who probably often produced them speculatively with no commission, and then looked to sell them (little is known about the market for album miniatures).\n\nThe artist who epitomises the Persian album miniature is Riza Abbasi, active from the 1580s until his death in 1635, whose early single miniatures of groups are somewhat like those in narrative scenes, but lacking any actual narrative attached to them. He soon turned to, and developed, subjects mostly of one or two figures, often portrait-like, although very few identities are given or were probably ever intended to be recognised. There are a large number of beautiful youths, to whose clothes great attention is paid.\n\nThe best Ottoman painting was heavily concentrated in the capital, which from 1453 was Istanbul, and the most important patron was always the Sultan. The royal library remains very largely intact in Turkey, mostly at Topkapi Palace, and was greatly enriched by Persian manuscripts, initially taken during the several Ottoman invasions of eastern Persia, and later, after a treaty in 1555, often received as diplomatic gifts. Many of these manuscripts were broken up to use the miniatures in albums. Persian artists were imported from virtually the start of the Ottoman tradition, but especially in the 16th century; sixteen artists were brought back just from the brief Ottoman conquest of Tabriz in 1514, though by 1558 the palace records list only nine foreign artists of all kinds, against twenty-six Turks. But a distinctively Ottoman style can be seen from the start of the 16th century, with pictures showing simpler landscape backgrounds, more sea and ships, neatly tented army camps, distant cityscapes, more individual characterization of faces, but also a less refined technique. There was strong European influence, mostly from Venice, but this was restricted to portraiture.\n\nTurkish albums include mixtures of collected miniatures similar to those in Persia, and often including Persian pieces, with the addition of rather more greatly elaborated pen drawings of an essentially decorative nature, of a foliage motif, or a bird or animal treated largely as such. Albums dedicated to the sultans, with portraits and laudatory pieces of text, are a distinctive Turkish type, and there were also albums of scenes of Turkish life, showing the relatively uniform costume of different ranks in society, methods of torture and execution, and other scenes of interest to the mostly Western foreigners they were produced for, matching similar prints made in contemporary Europe.\n\nOne very distinctive type of miniature is found only in Ottoman albums, though they may have been brought from Persia as booty, and perhaps were not intended for albums originally. These are eighty or so the mysterious and powerful images grouped under the name of Siyah Qalam, meaning \"Black Pen\" (or drunk or evil pen), full of demons and scenes which suggest nomadic life in Central Asia, though it has also been suggested that they come from a single Persian court artist letting himself go. They are perhaps from the early 15th century, reaching Turkey in the 16th.\n\nAnother distinctive type of Ottoman work is the découpage or cut paper miniature, where different colours of paper, cut with minute detail then pasted together, are used to create the image. This technique was used for book-covers in Timurid Persia, which were then varnished over for protection, but in Turkey the images were treated as miniatures and went inside albums; the technique was also much used for page border decoration.\n\nThe Mughal dynasty in the Indian subcontinent was rather later in establishing a large court atelier, which did not begin until after the exile in Persia of the second emperor, Humayun, who on his return was joined from about 1549 by Persian artists including Abd as-Samad. The Mughal style developed under the next emperor, Akbar, who commissioned some very large illustrated books, but his artists produced single miniatures for albums as well. In the case of the Jahangirnama, the emperor Jahangir kept a diary and commissioned paintings separately, which were most likely held in the Kitabkhana (किताबखाना), until his official contribution to the court chronicle genre could be assembled. From fairly early the Mughal style made a strong feature of realistic portraiture, usually in profile, and perhaps influenced by Western prints, which were available at the Mughal court. For a long time portraits were always of men, often accompanied by generalized female servants or concubines; but there is scholarly debate about the representation of female court members in portraiture. Some scholars claim there are no known extant likenesses of figures like Jahanara Begum and Mumtaz Mahal, and others attribute miniatures, for example from the Dara Shikoh album or the Freer Gallery of Art mirror portrait, to these famous noblewomen. Another popular subject area was realistic studies of animals and plants, mostly flowers; from the 17th century equestrian portraits, mostly of rulers, became another popular borrowing from the West. The single idealized figure of the Riza Abbasi type was less popular, but fully painted scenes of lovers in a palace setting became popular later. Drawings of genre scenes, especially showing holy men, whether Muslim or Hindu, were also popular.\n\nAkbar had an album, now dispersed, consisting entirely of portraits of figures at his enormous court which had a practical purpose; according to chroniclers he used to consult it when discussing appointments and the like with his advisors, apparently to jog his memory of who the people being discussed were. Many of them, like medieval European images of saints, carried objects associated with them to help identification, but otherwise the figures stand on a plain background. There are a number of fine portraits of Akbar, but it was under his successors Jahangir and Shah Jahan that the portrait of the ruler became firmly established as a leading subject in Indian miniature painting, which was to spread to both Muslim and Hindu princely courts across India.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries Indian artists working in the hybrid Indo-European Company style produced albums of miniatures for Europeans living in India as part of the British Raj and its French and Portuguese equivalents. Some Europeans collected or were given earlier Indian miniatures; the Large and Small Clive albums were presented to Lord Clive, and are now in the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. Others created albums of new work, tending to concentrate on animal portraits and the houses, horses and other possessions of this wealthy group. In the 19th century images of Indians and their costumes, often categorized by regional and ethnic type, or occupation, became very popular. Large-scale patrons included Colonel James Skinner of Skinner's Horse fame, who had a Rajput mother, and for natural history paintings, Mary Impey, wife of Elijah Impey, who commissioned over three hundred, and the Marquess Wellesley, brother of the first Duke of Wellington, who had over 2,500 miniatures.\n\nAlbums were often presented as gifts to mark a milestone in life. Chroniclers record that when the Persian Prince Ibrahim Mirza was killed in 1577, on the orders of Shah Tahmasp I, his wife, Tahmasp's sister, destroyed artworks including an album containing miniatures by Behzad among others, which her husband had compiled and given her for their wedding, washing the miniatures in water. Perhaps she did not want anything to fall into the hands of her brother, who had ordered his death, and who did take over the prince's atelier. Albums were often presented to rulers on their accession, or in Turkey at New Year. They could also be given as diplomatic gifts between rulers.\n\nA muraqqa was created for Sultan Murad III in 1572 when he ascended to the throne, which is unusual because the dedication is very detailed, including the date and place of creation, namely Istanbul, 980 AH/1572-73 AD. The dedication is to Murad III, also naming his compiler Mehmed Cenderecizade. The Murad III muraqqa was designed much more extravagantly than other Islamic muraqqa and with original nakkashane (Ottoman painting studio) border paintings. This muraqqa contained miniature paintings, ink drawings, and calligraphy, including ghazals. The Murad III muraqqa has twenty-four miniatures created in the cities of Bukhara to the east of Persia, Tabriz, Isfahan, and Qazvin in Persia, and Istanbul between the late fifteenth and seventeenth centuries. It has a two-page introduction written in Persian, which is similar in structure to Timurid and Safavid album prefaces, and indicates that this muraqqa was compiled in Istanbul less than two years before Murad III became Sultan.\n\nAnother album in the Ottoman royal collection contains only Western images, mostly prints but including a drawing in pen of an \"Ornamental Scroll with Putti and Penises\", \"for the merriment of adult guests at a dinner in Pera\". The collection was probably assembled for a Florentine in the late 15th century, probably a merchant living in Istanbul (where Pera was the quarter for Westerners). The other 15 images are a mixed group of Florentine engravings, mostly unique impressions (i.e. otherwise unknown), with some religious subjects and a coloured print of Mehmet II, who apparently acquired the album. It is of interest to art historians because only a small handful of early albums of Western prints survive anywhere, having been broken up by later collectors or dealers; they were probably common among collectors in Europe at the time.\n\n\nAbdur Rahman Chughtai was a painter who was responsible for the revival of the muraqqa in Pakistan in 1928 after publishing his Muraqqa-I Chughtai. When he started painting in the 1910s his major influence was Hindu mythology, but by the 1920s he was inspired by Islamic artwork including the muraqqa, ghazals, and Ottoman miniatures.\n\nUsing the emergent tools of digital humanities, Sumathi Ramaswamy at Duke University has recreated the form of a Mughal muraqqa’ to track the itineraries of the terrestrial globe in early modern India.\n\n\n\n"}

Often created to achieve a specific purpose related to another belief system, a parody religion can be a parody of several religions, sects, gurus, cults, or new religious movements at the same time or even a parody of no particular religion, instead parodying the concept of religious belief itself. In some parody religions, the emphasis is on having fun; the faith may be a convenient excuse for pleasant social interaction among the like-minded.\n\nOne approach to parody religion aims to highlight deficiencies in particular pro-religious arguments — the thinking being that if a given argument can also be used to support a clear parody, then the original argument is clearly flawed. An example of this is the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which parodies the equal time argument employed by intelligent design and creationism.\n\nOccasionally, a parody religion may offer ordination by mail or on-line at a nominal fee, seeking equal recognition for this clergy under freedom of religion provisions, including the 1st and 14th amendments to the United States Constitution. A few US states have permitted The Church of the Latter-Day Dude or Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster officiants to legally solemnise marriage. Parody religions also have sought the same reasonable accommodation legally afforded to mainstream religions, including religious-specific garb or headgear.\n\nSeveral religions that are classified as parody religions have a number of relatively serious followers who embrace the perceived absurdity of these religions as spiritually significant, a decidedly post-modern approach to religion. For instance, in Discordianism, it can be hard to tell whether even these \"serious\" followers are not just taking part in an even bigger joke.\n\nThe following were created as parodies of particular religious beliefs:\nThe following are post-modern religions that may be seen as elaborate parodies of already-existent religions:\nMany atheists, including Richard Dawkins, use parody religions such as those of the Flying Spaghetti Monster and the Invisible Pink Unicorn — as well as ancient gods like Zeus and Thor — as modern versions of Russell's teapot to argue that the burden of proof is on the believer, not the atheist.\n\nDawkins also created a parody of the criticism of atheism, coining the term \"athorism\", or the firm belief that the Norse deity Thor does not exist. The intention is to emphasize the claim that atheism is not a form of religious creed, but instead merely denial of beliefs.\nA common challenge against atheism is the idea that atheism is itself a form of \"faith\", a belief without proof. The theist might say \"No one can \"prove\" that God \"does not\" exist, therefore an atheist is exercising faith by asserting that there is no God.\" Dawkins argues that by replacing the word \"God\" with \"Thor\" one should see that the assertion is fallacious. The burden of proof, he claims, rests upon the believer in the supernatural, not upon the non-believer who considers such things unlikely. Athorism is an attempt to illustrate through absurdity that there is no logical difference between disbelieving particular religions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "358780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358780", "title": "Plain of Jars", "text": "Plain of Jars\n\nThe Plain of Jars (Lao: ທົ່ງໄຫຫິນ ) is a megalithic archaeological landscape in Laos. It consists of thousands of stone jars scattered around the upland valleys and the lower foothills of the central plain of the Xiangkhoang Plateau. The jars are mostly arranged in clusters ranging in number from one to several hundred.\n\nThe Xieng Khouang Plateau is located at the northern end of the Annamese Cordillera, the principal mountain range of Indochina. French researcher Madeleine Colani concluded in 1930 that the jars were associated with prehistoric burial practices. Excavation by Lao and Japanese archaeologists in the intervening years has supported this interpretation with the discovery of human remains, burial goods and ceramics around the jars. The Plain of Jars is dated to the Iron Age (500 BC to AD 500) and is one of the most important prehistoric sites in Southeast Asia.\n\nMore than 90 jar sites have been identified within Xiangkhouang Province. Each site has from one to 400 stone jars. The jars vary in height and diameter between 1m and 3m and are all hewn from rock. Their shape is cylindrical with the bottom always wider than the top. The stone jars are undecorated, with the exception of a single jar at Site 1. This jar has a human \"frogman\" bas-relief carved on the exterior. Parallels between the \"frogman\" and the rock painting at Huashan in Guangxi, China have been drawn. The Chinese paintings, which depict large full-frontal images of humans with arms raised and knees bent, are dated to 500 BC–200 AD.\n\nSince most of the jars have lip rims, it is thought that the jars originally supported lids, although few stone lids have been recorded; this may suggest that the bulk of lids were fashioned from perishable materials. Stone lids with animal carvings have been found at few sites such as Ban Phakeo (Site 52). The bas-relief carvings are thought to depict monkeys, tigers and frogs. \nStone discs have also been found. The discs, which differ from the lids, have at least one flat side and are grave markers which were placed on the surface to cover or mark a burial pit. These grave markers appear more infrequently than jars, but are found in close proximity. Similar are stone grave markers; these stones are unworked, but have been placed intentionally to mark a grave. To the north of Xieng Khouang an extensive network of intentionally placed largely unworked stones marking elaborate burial pits and chambers are known as \"standing stones of Huaphan\". These have been dated to the Bronze Age.\n\nThe jars lie in clusters on the lower footslopes and mountain ridges of the hills surrounding the central plateau and upland valleys. Several quarry sites have been recorded, usually close to the jar sites. Five rock types have been identified: sandstone, granite, conglomerate, limestone and breccia.\n\nThe majority of the jars are sandstone. It is assumed that Plain of Jars' people used iron chisels to manufacture the jars, although no conclusive evidence for this exists. Regional differences in jar shape have been noted. While the differences in most cases can be attributed to choice and manipulation of rock source, some differences in form (such as variations in the placement of jar apertures) appear to be unique to specific sites.\n\nA cave located at Site 1 is a natural limestone formation with an opening to the northwest and two man-made holes at the top. These holes are thought to be chimneys for a crematorium. French geologist and amateur archaeologist Madeleine Colani excavated inside the cave in the early 1930s and found material to support a crematorium theory. Colani also recorded and excavated at 12 Plain of Jars sites and published two volumes with her findings in 1935. Colani concluded that the Plain of Jars was an Iron Age burial site. Inside the jars she found, embedded in black organic soil, coloured glass beads, burnt teeth and bone fragments, sometimes from more than one individual. Around the stone jars, she found human bones, pottery fragments, iron and bronze objects, glass and stone beads, ceramic weights and charcoal. The bone and teeth inside the jars show signs of cremation, while the burials surrounding the jars yield unburnt secondary burial bones.\nNo further archaeological research was conducted until November 1994, when Professor Eiji Nitta of the Kagoshima University and Lao archaeologist Thongsa Sayavongkhamdy surveyed and mapped Site 1. Nitta claimed that the surrounding burial pits were contemporaneous to the jars, as they had been cut into the surface on which the jars had been placed. Nitta believed the jars were symbolic monument to mark the surrounding burials. He dated the Plain of Jars to the late second or early first millennium B.C. based on the burial urn and associated grave goods. Sayavongkhamdy undertook surveys and excavations between 1994 and 1996, supported by the Australian National University. Sayavongkhamdy and Peter Bellwood interpreted the stone jars as a central person's primary or secondary burial, surrounded by secondary burials of family members. Archaeological data collected during bomb clearance operations supervised by UNESCO archaeologist Julie Van Den Bergh in 2004–2005 and again in 2007 provided similar archaeological results. Like Nitta, Van Den Bergh concluded that the jars and surrounding burials were contemporaneous.\n\nVariations in the practices of cremation inside jars and secondary burial outside jars, as noted by Colani, have proven difficult to explain. The cremated remains seem to mainly belong to adolescents. While the bomb clearance operations did not involve emptying of jars and thus no additional evidence could be gathered, Van Den Bergh claimed that the stone jars initially may have been used to distil the dead bodies and that the cremated remains within the jars represent the most recent phase in Plain of Jars. The jars with smaller apertures may reflect the diminishing need to place an entire body inside.\n\nThe suggestion that the jars, in a similar fashion to traditional Southeast Asian Royal mortuary practices, functioned as 'distilling vessels', was put forward by R. Engelhardt and P. Rogers in 2001. In contemporary funerary practices followed by Thai, Cambodian and Laotian royalty, the corpse of the deceased is placed into an urn during the early stages of the funeral rites, at which time the soul of deceased is believed to be undergoing gradual transformation from the earthly to the spiritual world. The ritual decomposition is later followed by cremation and secondary burial.\n\nIncidentally, the megalithic Dravidians of South India used giant burial urns called Mudhumakkal Thazhi (burial-pots-of-the-old-people) or EemaThazhi. These funerary urns were buried with the bodies of the deceased or soon-to-die in a sitting posture, along with their personal goods and ornaments. This practice was in vogue until 200 AD.\n\nThe royal burials are located across watercourses from the habitation areas in a geographically high, prominent area. Among the Black Thai people who have been in the region at least since the 11th century, the upper classes are cremated in the belief that it will release their spirits to heaven, while commoners are buried, leaving their spirits to remain on Earth.\n\nColani connected the location of the jars sites to ancient trade routes, in particular with the salt trade. She assumed that salt was a commodity sought after by the Plain of Jars people, which brought traders to the Xieng Khouang Plateau. The Xieng Khouang area is rich in metallic minerals, mainly due to granite intrusions and associated hydrothermal activity.\n\nTwo principal iron ore deposits exist in Laos, both in Xieng Khouang. The presence and locations of the numerous jar sites in Xieng Khouang may relate to trading and mining activities. History has shown that Xieng Khouang, at the northern end of the Annamite Range, provides relative easy passage from the north and east to the south and west.\n\nWithin the geographic setting of Xieng Khouang, the jar sites may reflect a network of intercultural villages, whereby the locations of the jars are associated with long-distance overland routes which connect the Mekong basin and the Gulf of Tonkin System. The jar sites show superficial regional differences, such as jar form, material, and the number of jars per site. But all share common setting characteristics such as burial practices, elevated locations, and commanding views over the surrounding area.\n\nThe most investigated and visited Jar site is located close to the town of Phonsavan, and is known as Site 1. Seven jar sites have now been cleared of unexploded bombs and are open to visitors. These are currently sites 1, 2 and 3, and Site 16 near the Old Capital Xieng Khouang; Site 23, near the big hot spring in Muang Kham; Site 25 in the largely unvisited Phou Kout District; and Site 52, the largest known jar site to date with 392 jars near a traditional Hmong village only accessible by foot.\n\nLao legends tell of a race of giants who inhabited the area and who were ruled by a king, named Khun Cheung, who fought a long and ultimately victorious battle against an enemy. He supposedly created the jars to brew and store huge amounts of \"lau hai\" (\"lau\" means \"alcohol\", \"hai\" means \"jar\"—So \"lau hai\" means rice beer or rice wine in the jars) to celebrate his victory. Another local story states that the jars were molded from natural materials including clay, sand, sugar, and animal products in a type of stone mix. This led the locals to believe the cave at Site 1 was actually a kiln, and that the jars were fired there and are not actually hewn from stone.\n\nAnother suggested explanation for the jars' use is to collect monsoon rainwater for caravan travelers along their journey at times when rain may have been seasonal and water was not readily available on the easiest footpaths. Rainwater would then be boiled, even if stagnant, to become potable again, a practice long understood in Eastern Eurasia. The trade caravans that camped around these jars could have placed beads inside them as offerings, accompanying prayers for rain. Or the beads might simply have been unassociated lost items.\n\nBetween 1964 and 1973, the Plain of Jars was heavily bombed by the U.S. Air Force (see Secret War) operating against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao communist forces. The U.S. Air Force dropped more bombs on Laos, primarily the Plain of Jars, than it dropped during the whole of World War II. This included 262 million anti-personnel cluster bombs. An estimated 80 million of these did not explode and remain a deadly threat to the population.\n\nThe large quantity of unexploded bombs in the area, especially cluster munitions, limits free movement. Evidence of the bombing raids can be seen in the form of broken or displaced jars and bomb craters. Sightseeing on the Plain of Jars can only be done safely on cleared and marked pathways.\n\nThe Mines Advisory Group, a non-governmental organization, in collaboration with UNESCO and funded by the New Zealand government (NZAID), cleared unexploded bombs from the three most visited sites from July 2004 until July 2005. A second phase of bomb clearance at the sites also funded by NZAID was undertaken in 2007; four more jar sites were made safe.\n\nThe Lao PDR government and NZAID built a visitors centre that was opened on 13 August 2013 at the Plain of Jars Site 1. It is at the bottom of a hill 200m before a car park. The centre provides English language information panels on the history of the Plain of Jars culture, as well as its modern history during the 1964–1975 conflict.\n\nThe Lao PDR government is considering applying for status as a UNESCO World Heritage site for the Plain of Jars. The Lao-UNESCO Program for \"Safeguarding the Plain of Jars\" has been an ongoing effort by UNESCO and the Lao government to document and rehabilitate the Plain of Jars. Clearing the remaining bomb hazards must be done before the sites can be further studied and developed for tourism. One of the main objectives is community-based involvement in the management and conservation of the jar sites, which has been largely successful. However, tourism at the most visited sites has resulted in damage to some of the jars.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "221737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=221737", "title": "Political history", "text": "Political history\n\nPolitical history is the narrative and analysis of political events, ideas, movements, organs of government, voters, parties and leaders. It is interrelated to other fields of history, especially diplomatic history, as well as constitutional history and public history.\n\nPolitical history studies the organization and operation of power in large societies. By focusing on the elites in power, on their impact on society, on popular response, and on the relationships with the elites in other social history, which focuses predominantly on the actions and lifestyles of ordinary people, or people's history, which is historical work from the perspective of the common people.\n\nIn two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, and the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%. In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with social history, and political history came next at 841 (25%) faculty members.\n\nThe political history of the world is the history of the evolution of the political events, ideas, movements, leaders and entities, and the way these elements shape society as a whole; Special importance is their crystallisation into political entities such as republics, empires and so on; and the study of the international relations between them. Together with this descriptive analysis, the history of political thinking narrates the evolution of the political ideas and philosophy, and goes back to antiquity. Political history, and thus the history of political thinking throughout human existence stretches though up to Medieval period and the Renaissance. In the Age of Enlightenment, political entities expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and communist systems that exist of the Industrialied and the Modern Era, in parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the definite boundaries existing today.\n\nThe first \"scientific\" political history was written by Leopold von Ranke in Germany in the 19th century. His methodologies profoundly affected the way historians critically examine sources; see historiography for a more complete analysis of the methodology of various approaches to history. An important aspect of political history is the study of ideology as a force for historical change. One author asserts that \"political history as a whole cannot exist without the study of ideological differences and their implications.\" Studies of political history typically centre around a single nation and its political change and development. Some historians identify the growing trend towards narrow specialization in political history during recent decades: \"while a college professor in the 1940s sought to identify himself as a \"historian\", by the 1950s \"American historian\" was the designation.\"\n\nFrom the 1970s onwards, new movements challenged traditional approaches to political history. The development of social history shifted the emphasis away from the study of leaders and national decisions, and towards the role of ordinary people, especially outsiders and minorities. Younger scholars shifted to different issues, usually focused on race, class and gender, with little room for elites. After 1990 social history itself began to fade, replaced with postmodern and cultural approaches that rejected grand narrative.\n\nTraditional political history focused on major leaders and had long played a dominant role among academic historians in the United States. These studies accounted for about 25% of the scholarly books and articles written by American historians before 1950, and about 33% into the 1960s, followed by diplomacy. The arrival in the 1960s and 1970s of a new interest in social history led to the emergence of the \"new political history\" which saw young scholars put much more emphasis on the voters' behavior and motivation, rather than just the politicians. It relied heavily on quantitative methods to integrate social themes, especially regarding ethnicity and religion. The new social science approach was a harbinger of the fading away of interest in Great Men. The eclipse of traditional political approaches during the 1970s was a major shock, though diplomatic history fell even further. It was upstaged by social history, with a race/class/gender model. The number of political articles submitted to the \"Journal of American History\" fell by half from 33% to 15%. Patterson argued that contemporary events, especially the Vietnam War and Watergate, alienated younger scholars away from the study of politicians and their deeds. Political history never disappeared, but it never recovered its dominance among scholars, despite its sustained high popularity among the reading public. Some political historians made fun of their own predicament, as when William Leuchtenburg wrote, \"the status of the political historians within the profession has sunk to somewhere between that of a faith healer and a chiropractor. Political historians were all right in a way, but you might not want to bring one home to meet the family.\" Others were more analytical, as when Hugh Davis Graham observed:\n\nReadman (2009) discusses the historiography of British political history in the 20th century. He describes how British political scholarship mostly ignored 20th century history due to temporal proximity to the recent past, the unavailability of primary sources, and the potential for bias. The article explores how transitions in scholarship have allowed for greater interest in 20th century history among scholars, which include less reliance on archival sources, methodological changes in historiography, and the flourishing of new forms of history such as oral history.\n\nIn the course of the 1960s, however, some German historians (notably Hans-Ulrich Wehler and his cohort) began to rebel against this idea, instead suggesting a \"Primacy of Domestic Politics\" (\"Primat der Innenpolitik\"), in which the insecurities of (in this case German) domestic policy drove the creation of foreign policy. This led to a considerable body of work interpreting the domestic policies of various states and the ways this influenced their conduct of foreign policy.\n\nThe French \"Annales School\" had already put an emphasis on the role of geography and economics on history, and of the importance of broad, slow cycles rather than the constant apparent movement of the \"history of events\" of high politics. It downplayed politics and diplomacy. The most important work of the \"Annales\" school, Fernand Braudel's \"The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II\", contains a traditional Rankean diplomatic history of Philip II's Mediterranean policy, but only as the third and shortest section of a work largely focusing on the broad cycles of history in the \"longue durée\" (\"long term\"). The \"Annales\" were broadly influential, leading to a turning away from political history towards an emphasis on broader trends of economic and environmental change.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, an increasing emphasis on giving a voice to the voiceless and writing the history of the underclasses, whether by using the quantitative statistical methods of social history or the more postmodern assessments of cultural history, also undermined the centrality of politics to the historical discipline. Leff noted how social historians, \"disdained political\nhistory as elitist, shallow, altogether passe, and irrelevant to the drama of everyday lives.\"\nMaxRange is a dataset defining level of democracy and institutional structure(regime-type) on a 100-graded scale where every value represents a unique regimetype.

{"id": "40605472", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40605472", "title": "Social Democratic Party (UK)", "text": "Social Democratic Party (UK)\n\nThe Social Democratic Party (SDP) was a centrist political party in the United Kingdom. The party supported a mixed economy (favouring a system similar to the German social market economy), electoral reform, European integration and a decentralized state while rejecting the possibility of trade unions being overly influential within the industrial sphere. \n\nThe SDP was founded on 26 March 1981 by four senior Labour Party moderates, dubbed the \"Gang of Four\": Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams, who issued the Limehouse Declaration. Owen and Rodgers were sitting Labour Members of Parliament (MPs); Jenkins had left Parliament in 1977 to serve as President of the European Commission, while Williams had lost her seat in the 1979 general election. The four left the Labour Party as a result of the January 1981 Wembley conference which committed the party to unilateral nuclear disarmament and withdrawal from the European Economic Community. They also believed that Labour had become too left-wing, and had been infiltrated at constituency party level by Trotskyist factions whose views and behaviour they considered to be at odds with the Parliamentary Labour Party and Labour voters.\n\nFor the 1983 and 1987 General Elections, the SDP formed a political and electoral alliance with the Liberal Party, the SDP–Liberal Alliance. The party merged with the Liberal Party in 1988 to form the Social and Liberal Democrats, now the Liberal Democrats, although a minority left to form a continuing SDP led by David Owen.\n\nThe origin of the party can be traced back to the ideological divisions in the Labour Party in the 1950s (with its forerunner being the Campaign for Democratic Socialism established to support the Gaitskellites), but publicly lies in the 1979 Dimbleby Lecture given by Roy Jenkins as he neared the end of his presidency of the European Commission. Jenkins argued the necessity for a realignment in British politics, and discussed whether this could be brought about from within the existing Liberal Party, or from a new group driven by European principles of social democracy.\n\nThere were long-running claims of corruption and administrative decay within Labour at local level (the North East of England was to become a cause célèbre), and concerns that experienced and able Labour MPs could be deselected (i.e., lose the Labour Party nomination) by those wanting to put into a safe seat their friends, family or members of their own Labour faction. In some areas, the Militant tendency were held to be systematically targeting weak local party branches in safe seat areas in order to have their own candidates selected, and thus become MPs.\n\nEddie Milne at Blyth (Northumberland) and Dick Taverne in Lincoln were both victims of such intrigues during the 1970s, but in both cases there was enough of a local outcry by party members – and the electorate – for them to fight and win their seats as independent candidates against the official Labour candidates.\n\nIn Taverne's case, he had been fighting efforts by the Lincoln Constituency Labour Party to deselect him largely over his support for British membership of the European Communities. In October 1972 he resigned his seat to force a by-election in which he fought as a Democratic Labour candidate against the official party candidate. Taverne won by an unexpectedly large margin. He founded the short lived Campaign for Social Democracy (CFSD) thereafter, and wrote a book about events surrounding the by-election called \"The Future of the Left – Lincoln and After\" (1972). But the CFSD failed to gain nationwide support, and Taverne lost the seat at the October 1974 General Election. Some independent Social Democrats contested the October 1974 and 1979 General Elections, but none were elected.\n\nTaverne's Lincoln by-election campaign was also helped to a lesser degree by problems with the Conservative and Unionist Party candidate, Conservative Monday Club chairman Jonathan Guinness. His suggestion during the by-election that murderers should have razor blades left in their cells so they could decently commit suicide resulted in him being nicknamed \"Old Razor Blades\" during the campaign. This, combined with considerable Conservative grassroots disquiet over the Monday Club's links to the National Front, persuaded some Conservative voters to switch to Taverne in protest as much as tactically to ensure Labour suffered an embarrassing loss. (Guinness had been elected as Chairman specifically to eradicate such links.)\n\nOn 25 January 1981, leading figures from the Labour Party (Roy Jenkins, David Owen, Shirley Williams and Bill Rodgers, known collectively as the \"Gang of Four\") launched the Council for Social Democracy, which later became the Social Democratic Party in March, after outlining their policies in what became known as the Limehouse Declaration. The \"Gang of Four\" were centrists, who had defected from the Labour Party due to what they perceived to be the influence of the Militant tendency and the \"hard left\" within the party,\n\n\"Democratic\", \"Democratic Labour\", and \"Radical\" were all mentioned as possible names for the new party, as well as \"New Labour\" (which future Labour Party leader and eventual Prime Minister Tony Blair would use to successfully promote the Labour Party more than a decade later) but eventually \"Social Democratic\" was settled on because the \"Gang of Four\" consciously wanted to mould the philosophy and ideology of the new party on the social democracy practised on mainland Europe.\n\nThe opening statement of principles contained in the preamble of the party's constitution stated that: \"The SDP exists to create and defend an open, classless and more equal society which rejects prejudices based upon sex, race, colour or religion\". The constitution set out the establishment of a \"Council for Social Democracy\" (CSD) which was, in effect, the party's standing conference. Each area party was entitled to elect delegates to the CSD. A number of internal groups flourished within the new party, the most notable of which was the Tawney Society (mirroring the function of the Fabian Society within the Labour Party).\n\nTwenty-eight Labour MPs eventually joined the new party, along with one member of the Conservative Party, Christopher Brocklebank-Fowler, MP for North West Norfolk. Williams and Jenkins were not at the time Members of Parliament, but were elected to the House of Commons at by-elections in Crosby and Glasgow Hillhead respectively.\n\nThe defecting Labour MPs were:\n\nMuch of the party's initial membership came from the Social Democratic Alliance. The party also received a boost with the recruitment of former student leaders from outside the Labour Party. These included former Communist Party of Great Britain member Sue Slipman as well as Conservative Party members including: Adair Turner and Tom Hayhoe.\n\nAlthough the SDP was seen as being largely a breakaway from the right-wing of the Labour Party, an internal party survey found that 60% of its members had not belonged to a political party before, with 25% being drawn from Labour, 10% from the Conservatives and 5% from the Liberals.\n\nThe party enjoyed a considerable honeymoon period with the press, who made much mileage out of their quirk for proffering claret at their functions. Claret is an \"agreeable\" wine, and a metaphor for the party's harmonious internal relations compared to those of the strife-torn Labour Party of the period.\n\nThe policies of the SDP emphasised a middle position between perceived extremes of Thatcherism and the Labour Party. Its constitution argued for \"the fostering of a strong public sector and a strong private sector without frequent frontier changes\". The SDP favoured some neoliberal Thatcherite reforms during the 1980s, such as legislation aimed at reforming the trade unions (although the parliamentary SDP actually split three ways on Norman Tebbit's 1982 Industrial Relations Bill, most voting for, some against, and others abstaining), but took a more welfarist position than the Conservative Party, being more sceptical of Conservative welfare reforms (particularly regarding the National Health Service).\n\nAt the party's first electoral contest, Jenkins narrowly failed to win a by-election at Warrington in July 1981, describing it as his \"first defeat, but by far (his) greatest victory\". At the Glasgow Hillhead by-election in March 1982, another candidate called Douglas Parkin, nominated by a party called the Social Democratic Party which had been formed in Manchester in 1979, changed his name to Roy Harold Jenkins to contest the seat. SDP polling agents were given special dispensation by the Returning Officer to have placards outside of polling stations to state which one on the ballot papers was the real Roy. Ultimately, the SDP's Jenkins was elected.\n\nA leadership election was held later in the year, Jenkins beating Owen in the ballot to become the first leader of the new party. Later in the year, Shirley Williams defeated Bill Rodgers in the ballot to become SDP president.\n\nThe SDP formed the SDP–Liberal Alliance with the Liberal Party in June 1981, under the joint leadership of Roy Jenkins (SDP) and Liberal leader David Steel. The Liberal Party, and in particular its leader, David Steel, had applauded the formation of the SDP from the sidelines from the very start. Senior Liberal MP for Rochdale Cyril Smith caused some embarrassment, however, by publicly stating that the SDP \"should be strangled at birth\". During an era of public disillusionment with the two main parties – Labour and the Conservatives – and widescale unemployment, the Alliance achieved considerable success at parliamentary by-elections. At one point in late-1981, the party had an opinion poll rating of over 50%.\n\nAlso in 1981, David Steel was able to address the Liberal Party conference with the phrase \"Go back to your constituencies, and prepare for government!\"\n\nIn early-1982, after public disagreements over who could fight which seats in the forthcoming election, the poll rating dipped, but the party remained ahead of both Labour and the Conservatives. However, following the outbreak of the Falklands War on 2 April 1982, the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher soared from third to first place in the public opinion polls. The standing of the SDP–Liberal Alliance and Labour Party declined. By this stage, however, the SDP–Liberal Alliance already 30 MPs in parliament - virtually all of them defectors from Labour, joined by just the one Conservative MP.\n\nLabour lost Bermondsey, one of their ten safest seats, at a by-election in February 1983 to Liberal candidate Simon Hughes: the sitting Labour MP Robert Mellish resigned to work for the London Docklands Development Corporation but, being opposed to the selection by his left-wing Constituency Labour Party of Peter Tatchell, supported the former leader of Southwark council John O'Grady as \"Real Bermondsey Labour\" giving an impression of Labour division and in-fighting.\n\nAt the 1983 general election, the SDP–Liberal Alliance won more than 25% of the national vote, close behind Labour's 28%, but well behind the 44% secured by the Conservatives. However, because of the limitations of the first-past-the-post electoral system used in the United Kingdom, only 23 Alliance MPs were elected, six of whom were members of the SDP. The party's leader, Roy Jenkins, managed to retain his seat at Glasgow Hillhead, but SDP President Shirley Williams was defeated at Crosby (which she had won at a by-election in November 1981) as a result of unfavourable boundary changes. Labour Party leader Michael Foot, who resigned within days of the election, was critical of the SDP–Liberal Alliance for siphoning support away from Labour, allowing the Conservatives to win more seats and secure a triple-digit majority, while Labour was left with 209 seats in Parliament.\n\nThe MP for Plymouth Devonport, Dr. David Owen (who had been a Labour Government Minister under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan between 1974-79), took over as SDP leader after the 1983 general election. He was more sceptical about close relations with the Liberals than his predecessor Roy Jenkins, and favoured retaining the party's distinct identity. Owen's influence ensured that proposals for a merger between the two parties were shelved after a lengthy debate at the 1983 SDP conference.\n\nDuring the 1983-87 parliament, some SDP members started to become unsettled at what appeared to be the increasingly right-wing course taken by SDP leader David Owen. This resulted in some members launching the Limehouse Group in an attempt to keep the party on the centre-left course that was first propounded in the Limehouse Declaration.\n\nTwo more SDP MPs were elected at by-elections during the 1983-87 parliament, but at the 1987 general election, the Alliance's share of the vote fell to 23%, and the SDP's parliamentary party was reduced from eight members to five. Roy Jenkins was among those who lost their seats. Mike Hancock had won a by-election at Portsmouth South in 1984 from the Conservatives which was lost in 1987, but Rosie Barnes, who had won the bitterly contested Greenwich by-election in February 1987 from Labour; managed to hold on at the general election in June that year.\n\nFrom the outset, the formation of the Alliance had raised questions as to whether it would lead to a merged party, or the two parties were destined to compete with each other. This in turn led to grassroots tensions in some areas between Liberal and SDP branches that impaired their ability to mount joint campaigns successfully. Such cross-party feuding was part of the reason for Jenkins losing his Glasgow Hillhead seat to George Galloway of the Labour Party in 1987.\n\nLiberal pride was further damaged by the sustained lampooning of the Alliance by ITV's popular \"Spitting Image\" satirical puppet comedy programme, which portrayed Steel as the craven lickspittle of Owen; One sketch had Owen proposing to a simpering Steel that the parties merged under a new name: \"and for our side we'll take 'Social Democratic', and from your side, we'll take ‘Party'\"; and indeed a new leader \"from your side we will take 'David' and from ours 'Owen'\", to which a hesitant Steel agreed.\n\nAfter the disappointment of 1987, Steel proposed a formal merger of the two parties. Jenkins and Steel had believed this to be eventually inevitable after the party failed to break through at the 1983 election. The proposal, also supported by Williams and Rodgers, was fiercely opposed by Owen, who argued that such a merger would not be accepted by the electorate, and would not reverse their declining share of the vote. Jenkins denied that a merger had been his original intent.\n\nBut the majority of the SDP's membership (along with those of the Liberals) voted in favour of the union. Owen resigned as leader and was replaced by Robert Maclennan. Steel and Maclennan headed the new \"Social and Liberal Democrats\" party from 3 March 1988. An interim working name for the party, the \"Democrats\", was adopted by conference on 26 September 1988. This proved to be unpopular, and the party was renamed the Liberal Democrats in October 1989, as had been originally proposed at the September 1988 conference by the party's Tiverton branch.\n\nMost SDP members, including SDP MP and future Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, joined Maclennan in the merged party, but Owen created a continuing SDP, along with two other MPs, John Cartwright and Rosie Barnes. This party performed poorly at the May 1990 by-election in Bootle, behind the Monster Raving Loony Party. It subsequently disbanded, although a third SDP was formed, though currently operates on a much less influential scale. There was also a continuing Liberal Party, led by Michael Meadowcroft and David Morrish, mainly based on Liverpool and West Country Liberals who feared a dilution by the former SDP members of the Liberal tradition within the merged party.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the SDP, a number of members endorsed Conservative Prime Minister John Major for the 1992 general election.\n\n"}
{"id": "1627451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1627451", "title": "Starhawk (comics)", "text": "Starhawk (comics)\n\nStarhawk (Stakar of the House of Ogord) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He was created by Steve Gerber (writer) and Sal Buscema (artist). He is an antihero in the Earth-691 timeline of the Marvel Comics universe.\n\nStakar was fated to eventually re-inhabit his infant body, reliving his life over countless times. Because of the knowledge of things to come, he manipulated events to affect what he felt would be the best outcome, referring to himself as \"One Who Knows\". He made many enemies in doing so, but his tampering and guidance also led to the formation of the Guardians of the Galaxy in the 31st Century.\n\nUpon receiving his power from the Hawk God, Starhawk identified himself and summarized his purpose by saying \"I am the wisdom and the glory of your ancestors. I am the light and the giver of light. I am your heritage and your destiny! I am the POWER that was Arcturus!\"\n\nSylvester Stallone plays Stakar in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with his first appearance being in \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\".\n\nA character called Starhawk appeared in an advertisement on the last page of \"Marvel Super-Heroes\" #20 (May, 1969) as the feature that would appear in the next issue. That next issue, though, and all subsequent issues of the title, were reprints of older Marvel material. The unused cover of the Starhawk feature from \"Marvel Super-Heroes\" was used as the cover of the third issue of \"Marvelmania\", Marvel's in-house fanzine, and the first part of the unused story itself, by Roy Thomas and Dan Adkins, was printed in \"Marvelmania\" #6. Though the serialization was to continue in the next issue, the title was cancelled before that happened.\n\nThe in-continuity Starhawk first appeared in a cameo appearance in \"The Defenders\" #27 (Sep 1975),with his first full appearance in \"The Defenders\" #28 (Oct 1975). The character was created by Steve Gerber and Sal Buscema. It is unclear whether this Starhawk has any connection to the \"Marvel Super-Heroes\" character.\n\nStarhawk appeared along with the rest of the original Guardians of the Galaxy team in the 2014 series \"Guardians 3000\". Writer Dan Abnett described him as \"the soul\" of the team.\n\nA male child was born to the superheroes Quasar and Kismet in about the year 2002 of the Earth-691 timeline. As such, he was half human and half-artificially created being. Just as soon as he was born on the planet Vesper, he was kidnapped and deposited on the planet Arcturus IV. The baby was discovered by an Arcturian couple who were among the last of their planet's mutants; for much of his life, Stakar would believe that these mutants were his birth parents. The mutants were found and slain by the Reavers of Arcturus, Arcturian military cadres dedicated to eradicating the mutants of their race. The Reaver Ogord discovered the infant and, assuming him to be a normal Arcturian, adopted the child and raised him as his own with his wife Salaan, naming the boy Stakar.\n\nStakar cultivated an interest in science and archaeology and explored ruins containing the Hawk God. Around the year 2020, he and his adoptive sister Aleta Ogord reanimated the dormant deity and were physically transformed. They took turns occupying the same physical space, while the other stayed in a type of \"limbo\". They were given extraordinary power and left Arcturus IV for the stars; when dominant, Stakar adopted the costumed identity of Starhawk. Developing romantic feelings for one another, Stakar and Aleta petitioned the Hawk God to temporarily separate them. During this time, they had three children together: Sita, John and Tara.\n\nAs an adventurer and protector, Starhawk revealed himself to the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Defenders in the year 3014. He aided them in overthrowing the Badoon occupation of Earth. Starhawk joined the Guardians of the Galaxy in a space mission, and helped defeat the Topographical Man. It is later revealed he manipulated events to bring the Guardians together; for example, when Charlie-27 teleported from Jupiter to escape the Badoon, Starhawk caused him to be transported to Pluto where he met Martinex.\n\nDuring this time, Stakar's three children (Tara, John and Sita) were changed into energy vampires by Aleta's father and sent to kill Stakar. They died of accelerated old age. Aleta thereafter blamed Stakar (rather than her father) for the deaths of their children, and their relationship never recovered.\n\nStarhawk teamed with the time-traveling Thor, and battled Korvac and his Minions of Menace. Starhawk later traveled to the 1970s alongside his fellow Guardians, and assisted the Avengers in battle against Korvac. Alongside the Guardians, the Fantastic Four, Dargo, and Keeper, Starhawk battled manifestations of Korvac's power in various eras.\n\nIn 3017, Starhawk accompanied the Guardians on a quest to find the lost shield of Captain America. He battled Taserface and the Stark, and was physically separated from Aleta in an accident. Aleta was the stronger of the pair, and Stakar forcibly reabsorbed her to sustain himself. The two struggled for dominance of their physical space, and Stakar metemorphosed into a 'dark' version of himself, projecting 'black light'.\n\nBecause of Stakar's assault on their teammate, the Guardians chose to expel him from the team. Eventually, Aleta became dominant, and reverted Stakar's body to an infant state. Aware of his destiny, she sent him back in time to begin his life cycle again.\n\nWhen the Guardians traveled back in time to the 20th century of Earth-616, their native timeline was altered – to the extent that Starhawk had lived his entire life over again and was waiting for their arrival. Stakar and Aleta had harsh words for each other, and the Hawk God appeared and intervened, attaching the two ex-lovers by bonding their fingers together. After being forced to work together for a time, the Hawk God again granted them audience, allowing them to plead their cases. He separated them and allowed only Stakar to retain his power, while Aleta was given back her former power to manipulate light.\n\nAleta then chose to stay with the Guardians, while the Hawk God told Stakar the truth about his ancestry. He then went on a quest to learn more. During this quest he found the wounded Silver Surfer, whom he healed and equipped his Quantum Bands for a short time. Eon then reveals to Stakar that his biological father Quasar once wore the bands. Starhawk is then consumed by Abrogate, a place where all former Quantum-Band wielders go after death. Quasar tells him about his lover and Stakar's mother Kismet. Stakar finds her alive and living in a secluded religious retreat on the planet Vesper. After that, a creature who called himself Era, the son of Eon, revealed himself. It admitted having kidnapped Stakar at birth, along with other vile deeds.\n\nWith the encouragement of the Hawk God, Starhawk and Kismet dedicated themselves to locating and confronting Era.\n\nUsing some technology from his timeline, Starhawk teleports himself into the 21st century of the Earth-616 timeline, to meet up with that era's equivalent of the Guardians of the Galaxy on Knowhere. Vance Astro, aka Major Victory, was found by this new squad of Guardians, and Starhawk fights him before teleporting away. Starhawk again ventures to Knowhere, but this time appears as a woman. Claiming that there is not meant to be a Guardians of the Galaxy at this point in the timeline, and that Major Victory's appearance there has put the entire future in flux, she again attempts to kill Astro and the Guardians. She is detained by the Guardians, and held captive for a time, until Moondragon released her. She discovers that the anomaly that is disturbing the time stream is not Astro or the Guardians, but instead Black Bolt activating a bomb that will cause time and space to collapse. Starhawk sacrifices her life to save the Guardians, and instructs Star-Lord to stop Black Bolt, at any cost.\n\nThe true extent of Starhawk's powers is unknown, but they are said to be immense in nature. He has an incredibly long lifespan, possibly inherited from his mother or due to his empowerment by the Hawk God.\n\nStarhawk can manipulate light to create concussive force blasts of photonic energy, heat, and solid-light constructs. He can also fly at the speed of light by tapping anti-gravitons, and survive in the vacuum of space. By tapping into Aleta's powers (when merged with her), he can also generate solid constructs of light; it is unknown if he can do so since their separation. His natural senses, especially eyesight, are enhanced to a superhuman degree; in addition, his powers give him extrasensory sensitivity to energy patterns and fluctuations in his environment, and he can track energy trails across intergalactic distances.\n\nHe has superhuman strength and durability, and he can enhance these further by reinforcing his body with light energy; on one occasion, he was able to engage in hand-to-hand combat with the thunder god Thor. He has an immunity to most known diseases and radiation sickness.\n\nHe seemingly has precognition, designating himself as \"One-Who-Knows\", but this is actually an effect of remembering what happened in his previous life cycle. However, due to Starhawk's efforts to change events for the better in each cycle, as well as the manipulations of beings with greater understanding of the universe (such as Mephisto), these memories can become unreliable; the overall thrust of events may be the same, but vital details might differ from his previous incarnation.\n\nWhen he forced Aleta to re-merge with him after their second separation, Starhawk's power changed from light to dark, and he was able to create constructs out of solid darkness, and fire blasts of shadowy force. Valentino had initially decided to call him Shadowhawk, but Tom DeFalco convinced him to save the name for a brand new character.\n\nStakar has knowledge of the archaeology of the planet Arcturus IV. He also has extensive knowledge of various civilizations throughout the Milky Way Galaxy.\n\nHis costume is made of alien materials, including a retracting transparent facemask and life support system, and retractable solar wind collector wings.\n\n\nStarhawk appears in \"Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2\". He appears in the \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" DLC.\n\n"}
{"id": "1037383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1037383", "title": "The Knight of the Burning Pestle", "text": "The Knight of the Burning Pestle\n\nThe Knight of the Burning Pestle is a play in five acts by Francis Beaumont, first performed at Blackfriars Theatre in 1607 and published in a quarto in 1613. It is the earliest whole parody (or pastiche) play in English. The play is a satire on chivalric romances in general, similar to \"Don Quixote\", and a parody of Thomas Heywood's \"The Four Prentices of London\" and Thomas Dekker's \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\". It breaks the fourth wall from its outset.\n\nIt is most likely that the play was written for the child actors at Blackfriars Theatre, where John Marston had previously had plays produced. In addition to the textual history testifying to a Blackfriars origin, there are multiple references within the text to Marston, to the actors as children (notably from the Citizen's Wife, who seems to recognise the actors from their school), and other indications that the performance took place in a house known for biting satire and sexual double entendre. Blackfriars specialised in satire, according to Andrew Gurr (quoted in Hattaway, ix), and Michael Hattaway suggests that the dissonance of the youth of the players and the gravity of their roles combined with the multiple internal references to holiday revels because the play had a Shrovetide or midsummer's day first production (Hattaway xxi and xiii). The play is certainly carnivalesque, but the date of the first performance is purely speculative. The second quarto publication came in 1635, with a third the same year. The play was omitted from the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647 but included in the second folio of 1679. The play was later widely thought to be the joint work of Beaumont and John Fletcher.\n\nScene: London and the neighbouring Country, except Act IV Scene ii, set in Moldavia.\n\nAs a play called \"The London Merchant\" is about to be performed, a Citizen and his Wife \"in the audience\" of the play interrupt to complain that the play will misrepresent the middle-class citizens of the city. The Citizen, who identifies himself as a grocer, climbs onto the stage, and he brings his Wife up to sit with him on the stage next to some Gentlemen of the audience. The Citizen and his Wife demand that the players put on a play of their own choosing and suggest that one of them—in fact, their apprentice, Rafe—should have a part in the play. Rafe demonstrates his dramatic skills by quoting some lines of Shakespeare (Hotspur in Henry IV, Part 1). He then has a part created for him as a knight errant. He refers to himself as the \"Grocer Errant\" and has a burning pestle on his shield as a heraldic device.\n\nThis meta-fictional plot is intercut with the main plot of the interrupted play, \"The London Merchant\", where Jasper Merrythought, the merchant's apprentice, is in love with his master's daughter, Luce, and must elope with her to save her from the arranged marriage with Humphrey, a \"swell\" or City man of fashion. Humphrey is portrayed as a gullible weakling who often speaks in malapropisms indicating that his pretensions to learning and breeding are false. Luce pretends to Humphrey that she has made an unusual vow: she will only marry a man who has the spirit to run away with her. She knows that Humphrey will immediately inform her father of this plan. She intends to pretend to elope with Humphrey, knowing that her father will allow this to happen, but will then ditch him and meet up with Jasper.\n\nMeanwhile, Jasper's mother has decided to leave her husband Old Merrythought, who, in an apparent mid-life crisis, has spent all his savings in drinking and partying. Whenever he appears he turns every conversation into a song. When Jasper seeks his mother's aid, she rejects him in favour of his younger brother Michael. She tells Michael that she has kept jewellery they can use to live on while he learns a trade. They leave Merrythought, but they get lost in a wood where she loses her jewellery. Jasper arrives in the same wood to meet Luce and finds the jewels. Luce and Humphrey appear. Jasper, as planned, knocks over Humphrey and runs off with Luce. Rafe the \"grocer errant\" arrives. He believes he has met a damsel in distress when he sees the distraught Mrs Merrythought. He takes the Merrythoughts to an inn, expecting the Host to put them up for free because of a chivalric code of service. When the Host demands payment for the room and meal Rafe is perplexed. The host decides to tell Rafe there are more people in distress he must save from an evil barber named Barbaroso (in fact a barber surgeon who is attempting cures on various people with venereal diseases). Rafe effects a daring rescue of Barbaroso's patients.\n\nThe Citizen and his Wife demand more chivalric and exotic adventures for Rafe, so a scene is created in which Rafe must go to Moldavia, where he meets the Princess of Moldavia, who falls in love with him. But he says he has already plighted troth to his lady, Susan \"a cobbler's maid in Milk Street\". The Princess reluctantly lets him go, lamenting that she cannot come to England because she has always dreamed of tasting English beer.\n\nThings go awry for Jasper when he decides to \"test\" Luce's love by pretending he intends to kill her because of the way her father has treated him. She is shocked, but declares her devotion to him. At this point Humphrey and her father arrive with other men. They beat up Jasper, and drag Luce away from him. The merchant locks Luce in her room. Jasper decides to pretend he has died. He writes a letter, supposedly a dying apology for his behaviour. It is sent with the news of his death to the merchant. Jasper's coffin is carried to the merchant's house (as the merchant is responsible for his apprentice). Luce laments his death, but he gets up from the coffin and explains that he intends to save her from marriage to Humphrey. She is carried out in the coffin while Japser remains in the house. When the merchant enters Jasper pretends to be his own ghost and frightens the merchant into expelling Humphrey from the house and helping Jasper's near-bankrupt father. A chastened Mrs Merrythought\nreturns to her husband and by this point Luce has been delivered to the house in the coffin. Jasper appears and reveals he is still alive. Then the merchant also appears and asks for Old Merrythought's forgiveness. The merchant gives consent to Jasper's match with Luce. The Citizen and the Wife demand that Rafe's part of the drama should also have an appropriate ending, so Rafe is given a heroic chivalric dying scene, and everyone is satisfied.\n\nThe play hits a number of satirical and parodic points. The audience is satirised, with the interrupting grocer, but the domineering and demanding merchant class is also satirised in the main plot. Beaumont makes fun of the new demand for stories of the middle classes for the middle classes, even as he makes fun of that class's actual taste for an exoticism and a chivalry that is entirely hyperbolic. The Citizen and his Wife are bombastic, sure of themselves, and certain that their prosperity carries with it mercantile advantages (the ability to demand a different play for their admission fee than the one the actors have prepared).\n\nThe broader humour of the play derives from innuendo and sexual jokes, as well as joking references to other dramatists. The players, for example, plant a winking joke at the Citizen's expense, as the pestle of Rafe's herald is a phallic metaphor, and a burning pestle/penis implies syphilis, on the one hand, and sexual bravado, on the other. The inability of the Citizen and Wife to comprehend how they are satirised, or to understand the main plot, allows the audience to laugh at itself, even as it admits its complicity with the Citizen's boorish tastes.\n\nIf written for Blackfriars, \"The Knight of the Burning Pestle\" would have initially been produced in a small private theatre, with minimal stage properties. However, the private theatres were first to introduce the practice of having audience members seated on the stage proper (according to Gurr, \"op cit.\" in Hattaway ix), which is a framing device for this play's action. Additionally, the higher cost of a private theatre (sixpence, compared to a penny at some public theatres) changed the composition of the audience and would have suggested a more critically aware (and demanding) crowd. The play makes use of several \"interludes,\" which would have been spare entertainments between the acts (but which are integrated into the performance in this case), again emphasising the smallness and spareness of the initial staging (as interludes would have allowed for technicians to arrange the lights and scenery and to put actors in place).\nRevivals of the play are largely undocumented, but some are attested. Hattaway suggests that it was performed in the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane in 1635, at court the next year, and then after the Restoration at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane in 1662 and again in 1665 and 1667 (Hattaway xxix). The play \"has proved popular with amateur and university groups,\" according to Hattaway, but not with professional troupes.\n\nThe play was a failure when it was first performed, though it won approval over the next generation or two. In Richard Brome's \"The Sparagus Garden\" (1635), the character Rebecca desires to see it \"above all plays.\" Beaumont's comedy was performed at Court by Queen Henrietta's Men on 28 February 1636 (new style).\n\nThe play was revived in London in 1904, with Nigel Playfair in the principal role of Rafe. In 1920 the young Noël Coward starred as Rafe in a Birmingham Repertory Theatre production which transferred to the West End. \"The Times\" called the play \"the jolliest thing in London\". In 1932 the play was staged at the Old Vic, with Ralph Richardson as Rafe and Sybil Thorndyke as the Citizen's Wife. The Greenwich Theatre presented the play in 1975, with Gordon Reid as Rafe. The Royal Shakespeare Company performed it in 1981, with Timothy Spall in the lead. In a 2005 revival at the Barbican Theatre Rafe was played by Spall's son Rafe, who was named after the character in the play. The play was performed as part of the opening season of the Sam Wanamaker Theatre in 2014. It was performed in 1963 at Oxford University by The Queen's Players in the Provost's Gardens at The Queen's College.\n\nIn 1957 the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego presented \"The Knight of the Burning Pestle\". The American Shakespeare Center (then the Shenandoah Shakespeare Express) staged it in 1999 and revived it in 2003 at the Blackfriars Playhouse in Staunton, Virginia, a recreation of Shakespeare's Blackfriars Theatre. The American Shakespeare Center's \"Rough, Rude, and Boisterous tour\" of 2009 to 2010 also included the play. The Theater at Monmouth staged the play in the summer of 2013. In June 2016, Theatre Pro Rata, a small professional theater in St. Paul, Minnesota, staged a 90-minute version of the play with eight actors, four in the play–within–the–play playing multiple roles.\n\nA 90-minute television film version was broadcast by BBC Television on 19th and 30th December 1938. The film had music by Frederic Austin and starred Frederick Ranalow as Merrythought, Hugh E. Wright as The Citizen, Margaret Yarde as Wife, Manning Whiley as Tim and Alex McCrindle as George Greengoose.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "65771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65771", "title": "Theatre technique", "text": "Theatre technique\n\nTheatre techniques are procedures that facilitate a successful presentation of a play. They also include any practices that advance and enhance the understanding the audience brings to the action and the acting by the cast\non stage.\n\nTheatre technique is part of the playwright's creative writing of drama, as a kind of mimesis rather than mere illusion or imitation of life, in that the playwright is able to present a reality to the audience that is different, yet recognisable to that which they usually identify with in their everyday lives.<br> Another aspect of this is that of creating the kind of dialogue that makes the playwright's characters come alive and allows for their development in the course of his dramatization.\n\nThe playwright's art also consists in the ability to convey to the audience the ideas that give essence to the drama within the frame of its structure. \nFinally, the feeling for the natural divisions of a play—including acts, scenes, and changes of place—its entries and exits, and the positioning of the cast are integral to playwriting technique.\n\nOne of the playwright’s functions is that concerned with adaptations of existing traditional drama, such as Charles Marowitz’s collages of \"Hamlet\" and \"Macbeth\" and other re-interpretations of Shakespeare's works, as well as Tom Stoppard’s approaches in \"Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead\", \"Dogg's Hamlet\", and \"Cahoot's Macbeth\".\n\nThe director these days is responsible for the actual production of a play, as opposed to earlier days when it was the producer who, at least in Britain until the 1950s, had this task. In earlier centuries it was the author, an actor-manager, or a leading actor with whom the responsibilities of staging a drama were invested.\n\nThe director produces the play in the way he envisages how it ought to be seen as he interprets what the playwright intended within the drama; he takes care of the effectiveness of the rehearsals of the actors; and coordinates the work of designers and technicians in the production. \nHowever, the playwright’s work is still reflected in the director’s prompt copy, a separate form of stage instructions worked out in detail by the director, in which each actor is given details as to what is happening onstage, where exactly he has to be in relation to the back, front, left, or right of the stage, and what he is to do at any one time during the play.\n\nThe stage manager has to work with the director, and ascertain whether both the director’s objectives and the perceptions of the stage designers are compatible and realistic. They are usually the link between the director and the rest of the company, and are responsible for the director’s visions being passed down to each actor and member of the running crew. They are also responsible for safety and running an orderly backstage area. They maintain the prompt book and the call board, to which rehearsal schedule notes are affixed for the cast.\n\nStagecraft overall has to address the various shortcomings of the stage’s spatial and physical limitations. For example, the stage alone cannot be expected to provide wide and distant vistas, or vast spaces where armies gather or huge masses of people congregate. Natural phenomena such as thunderstorms or winds, that are often part of the drama, cannot be recreated in their original form. Furthermore, because of the distance involved, it is difficult for actors to portray the feelings, tensions and passions of their characters to the audience with much distinctiveness.\n\nIt is for these reasons that special technologies and techniques have been developed from classical times onward to supplement and augment the effects that are to be realised. Technical specialists help to implement these techniques by providing expertise in various areas of the production. The stage manager and their team must ultimately draw all these separate techniques together to create an effective and successful stage production.\n\n\nThe \"Classical unities\" of time, action and place were the main principles of French neo-classical drama during part of the 17th century.<br>They were introduced by Jean Mairet after a misreading of Aristotle's \"Poetics\", and the critic Castelvetro insisted that playwrights and directors adhere to the unities. In the \"Poetics\" Aristotle had merely recommended that action should consist only of the main plot without any subplots, and that the time represented by action should not stretch beyond the length of one day. Time merely entered into his recommendations as a hint as to the limits of the attention span the audience could be expected to have. The unity of place, that of the confinement of the action in a play to one locality only, was not mentioned at all.<br>The effect of the three unities on French drama during this period was that their presentation became very restrictive, and it was only when later dramatists began to avoid mentioning specific times and places that the presentation of plays became more creative again.\n\nSome dramatists and dramaturgists try to achieve particular effects that are not normally sought in a theatre presentation.\n\nBertolt Brecht coined the term \"defamiliarization effect\" (sometimes called \"estrangement effect\" or \"alienation effect\"; German \"Verfremdungseffekt\") for an approach to theater that focused on the central ideas and decisions in the play, and discouraged involving the audience in an illusory world and in the emotions of the characters. Brecht thought the audience required an emotional distance to reflect on what is being presented. See epic theater.\n\nOne of the oldest techniques that has been used often, is that of \"teichoscopy\" or the \"viewing from the wall\", in which actors observe events beyond the confines of the stage, such as a distant battle, and discuss it on stage while the battle is taking place, as opposed to the event being reported by messengers at a later time after the event has happened. Shakespeare uses this technique in the final scenes of the play Julius Ceasre\"Julius Caesar\".\n\n"}
{"id": "2562517", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2562517", "title": "United States anti-abortion movement", "text": "United States anti-abortion movement\n\nThe United States anti-abortion movement (or the pro-life movement or right-to-life movement) contains elements opposing elective or therapeutic abortion on both moral and sectarian grounds and supports its legal prohibition or restriction. Advocates generally argue that human life begins at conception and that the human zygote (or embryo or fetus) is a person and therefore has a right to life. The anti-abortion movement includes a variety of organizations, with no single centralized decision-making body. There are diverse arguments and rationales for the anti-abortion stance. Some anti-abortion activists concede arguments for permissible abortions, including therapeutic abortions, in exceptional circumstances such as incest, rape, severe fetal defects or when the woman's health is at risk.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court 1973 decisions in \"Roe v. Wade\" and \"Doe v. Bolton\", anti-abortion views predominated and found expression in state laws which prohibited or restricted abortions in a variety of ways. (See Abortion in the United States.) The anti-abortion movement became politically active and dedicated to the reversal of the \"Roe v. Wade\" decision, which struck down most state laws restricting abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy.\nIn the United States, the movement is associated with several Christian religious groups, especially the Catholic Church, and is frequently, but not exclusively, allied with the Republican Party. The movement is also supported by secular organizations (such as Secular Pro-Life) and non-mainstream anti-abortion feminists. The movement seeks to reverse \"Roe v. Wade\" and to promote legislative changes or constitutional amendments, such as the Human Life Amendment, that prohibit or at least broadly restrict abortion.\n\nOn the other side of the abortion debate in the United States is the abortion-rights movement (also called the pro-choice movement), which argues that pregnant women should have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.\n\nIn the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion against the legalization of abortion. In the United States, the National Right to Life Committee was formed in 1968, while in Australia, the National Right to Life formed in 1970.\n\nThe description \"pro-life\" was adopted by the right-to-life (anti-abortion) movement in the United States following the Supreme Court 1973 decision \"Roe v. Wade\", which held that a woman may terminate her pregnancy prior to the viability of the fetus outside of the womb and may also terminate her pregnancy \"subsequent to viability ... for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\" The term \"pro-life\" was adopted instead of \"anti-abortion\" to highlight their proponents' belief that abortion is the taking of a human life, rather than an issue concerning the restriction of women's reproductive rights. The first organized action was initiated by U.S. Catholic bishops who recommended in 1973 that the U.S. Constitution should be amended to ban abortion.\n\n\"Roe v. Wade\" was considered a major setback by anti-abortion campaigners. The case and the overturning of most anti-abortion laws spurred the growth of a largely religious-based anti-abortion political and social movement, even as Americans were becoming, in the 1970s and 1980s, increasingly pro-choice. The first major anti-abortion success since \"Roe's case\" came in 1976 with the passing of the Hyde Amendment prohibiting the use of certain federal funds for abortions. In \"Harris v. McRae\", anti-abortion advocates won a 1980 challenge to the Hyde Amendment. That same year, the anti-abortion movement gained control of the Republican Party's platform committee, adding anti-abortion planks to the Republican position, and calling for a Human Life Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, banning abortion. Four anti-abortion U.S. Presidents – Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump – were elected.\n\nSome in the media have noted a revitalization of the anti-abortion movement in the 21st century. In 2011, Fred Barnes of \"The Weekly Standard\" wrote:\n\nBarnes also discussed the rise in opposition to abortion among the younger generations, especially the millennials, the prevalence of crisis pregnancy centers, and the rejuvenation of old anti-abortion groups, such as Students for Life, and the rise of new ones, such as 40 Days for Life and Live Action. Lisa Miller of \"The Washington Post\" wrote about the younger, more feminine face of the anti-abortion movement with the rise of leaders such as Lila Rose of Live Action, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List, Charmaine Yoest of Americans United for Life, Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America, and Kristan Hawkins of Students for Life, all \"youngish Christian working mothers with children at home\" who seek to combat the image of the anti-abortion movement as made up of \"old white men\" who cannot relate to the experience of pregnant women.\n\nThe anti-abortion movement has been successful in recent years in promoting new laws against abortion within the states. The Guttmacher Institute said eighty laws restricting abortion were passed in the first six months of 2011, \"more than double the previous record of 34 abortion restrictions enacted in 2005—and more than triple the 23 enacted in 2010\".\n\nThe anti-abortion movement includes a variety of organizations, with no single centralized decision-making body. There are diverse arguments and rationales for the anti-abortion stance.\n\nThere are many socially conservative organizations in the U.S. that support the anti-abortion movement. Some groups focus solely on promoting the anti-abortion cause, such as American Life League, the Susan B. Anthony List, National Right to Life Committee, Americans United for Life, and Live Action, among many others. Other groups support not only the anti-abortion cause but the broader family values cause, such as Family Research Council, Focus on the Family, American Family Association, and Concerned Women for America, among many others.\n\nAbortion opponents generally believe that human life should be valued either from fertilization or implantation until natural death. The contemporary anti-abortion movement is typically, but not exclusively, influenced by conservative Christian beliefs, especially in the United States, and has influenced certain strains of bioethical utilitarianism. From that viewpoint, any action which destroys an embryo or fetus kills a person. Any deliberate destruction of human life is considered ethically or morally wrong and is not considered to be mitigated by any benefits to others, as such benefits are coming at the expense of the life of what they believe to be a person. In some cases, this belief extends to opposing abortion of fetuses that would almost certainly expire within a short time after birth, such as anencephalic fetuses.\n\nSome abortion opponents also oppose certain forms of birth control, particularly hormonal contraception such as emergency contraception (ECPs), and copper IUDs which prevent the implantation of an embryo. Because they believe that the term \"pregnancy\" should be defined so as to begin at fertilization, they refer to these contraceptives as abortifacients because they cause the embryo to starve. An embryo gets its nourishment off the uterine wall and dies if not attached. The Catholic Church endorses this view, but the possibility that hormonal contraception has post-fertilization effects is disputed within the scientific community, including some anti-abortion physicians.\nAttachment to an anti-abortion position is often but not exclusively connected to religious beliefs about the sanctity of life (see also culture of life). Exclusively secular-humanist positions against abortion tend to be a minority viewpoint among anti-abortion advocates; these groups say that their position is based on human rights and biology, rather than religion. Some holding the anti-abortion position also hold a complementarian view of gender roles, though there is also a self-described feminist element inside the movement.\n\nThe variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups. For example, the Catholic Church considers all procured abortions morally evil, while traditional Jewish teaching sanctions abortion if necessary to safeguard the life and well-being of the pregnant woman.\n\nThe only coordinated opposition to abortion in the United States during the early 1970s before the \"Roe v. Wade\" decision was from the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and its Family Life Bureau. Mobilization of a wide-scale anti-abortion movement began immediately after in 1973 with the creation of the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC).\n\nBefore 1980, the Southern Baptist Convention officially advocated for loosening of abortion restrictions. During the 1971 and 1974 Southern Baptist Conventions, Southern Baptists were called upon \"to work for legislation that will allow the possibility of abortion under such conditions as rape, incest, clear evidence of severe fetal deformity, and carefully ascertained evidence of the likelihood of damage to the emotional, mental, and physical health of the mother.\" W. Barry Garrett wrote in the \"Baptist Press\", \"Religious liberty, human equality and justice are advanced by the <nowiki>[Roe v. Wade]</nowiki> Supreme Court abortion decision.\" By 1980, conservative Protestant leaders became vocal in their opposition to legalized abortion, and by the early 1990s Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition of America became a significant anti-abortion organization. In 2005, Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, said that making abortion illegal is more important than any other issue.\n\nMuch of the anti-abortion movement in the United States and around the world finds support in the Roman Catholic Church, the Christian right, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, the Church of England, the Anglican Church in North America, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS). However, the anti-abortion teachings of these denominations vary considerably. The Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church consider abortion to be immoral in all cases, but may in some cases permit an act which indirectly and without intent results in the death of the fetus in a case where the mother's life is threatened. In Pope John Paul II's Letter to Families he simply stated the Roman Catholic Church's view on abortion and euthanasia: \"Laws which legitimize the direct killing of innocent human beings through abortion or euthanasia are in complete opposition to the inviolable right to life proper to every individual; they thus deny the equality of everyone before the law.\"\n\nThe National Association of Evangelicals has adopted a number of resolutions stating its opposition to abortion, but \"recognizes that there might be situations in which terminating a pregnancy is warranted – such as protecting the life of a mother or in cases of rape or incest.\" The position of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) is that \"elective abortion for personal or social convenience is contrary to the will and the commandments of God\" but that abortion may be justified where the pregnancy endangers life of the mother, or where the pregnancy is the outcome of rape or incest. The Taskforce of United Methodists on Abortion and Sexuality (TUMAS) was formed in 1987 to further the anti-abortion ministry in The United Methodist Church. The Southern Baptist Convention believes that abortion is allowable only in cases where there is a direct threat to the life of the woman.\n\nAmong Mainline Protestant denominations, the Episcopal Church recognizes a right of a pregnant woman to terminate a pregnancy, but opposes \"abortion as a means of birth control, family planning, sex selection or any reason of mere convenience.\" The United Church of Christ supports abortion rights, viewing it as a matter of reproductive health and justice. The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) adopts the view that abortion is a personal choice, but acknowledges \"diverse conclusions and actions\" within the church on the issue. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America's position is that abortion prior to the point of viability \"should not be prohibited by law or by lack of public funding\" but that \"abortion after the point of fetal viability should be prohibited except when the life of a mother is threatened or when fetal abnormalities pose a fatal threat to a newborn.\"\n\nSupporters of the consistent life ethic also oppose abortions as one of the acts that end human life. In 1979, Juli Loesch linked anti-abortion and anti-nuclear weapons arguments to form the group Pro Lifers for Survival. In 1987 this group defined an ethic of the sanctity of all life, and formed the group Seamless Garment Network. This group was against abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, militarism, poverty and racism. Beginning in 1983, American Catholic Cardinal Joseph Bernardin argued that abortion, euthanasia, capital punishment, and unjust war are all related, and all wrong. He said that \"to be truly 'pro-life,' you have to take all of those issues into account.\" Paul M. Perl studied 1996 voter statistics and found that the consistent life ethic is difficult for religious leaders to promote because it combines the generally conservative anti-abortion stance with a liberal social attitude.\n\nThe United States Republican Party platform advocates an anti-abortion position, though there are some pro-choice Republicans. The Republican group The Wish List supports pro-choice Republican women just as EMILY's List supports pro-choice Democratic women. The Susan B. Anthony List (SBA List) is dedicated to \"increasing the percentage of anti-abortion women in Congress and high public office,\" and seeks to eliminate abortion in the U.S. The Democrats for Life of America are a group of anti-abortion Democrats on the political left who advocate for an anti-abortion plank in the Democratic Party's platform and for anti-abortion Democratic candidates. Former vice-presidential candidate Sargent Shriver, the late Robert Casey, a former two-term governor of Pennsylvania, and former Rep. Bart Stupak (D-Mich), a former leader of the bipartisan anti-abortion caucus in the United States House of Representatives, have been among the most well-known anti-abortion Democrats. However, following his vote in favor of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Marjorie Dannenfelser of the SBA List reported that her organization was revoking an anti-abortion award it had been planning to give to Stupak, and anti-abortion organizations accused Stupak of having betrayed the anti-abortion movement.\n\n\"The New York Times\" reported in 2011 that the anti-abortion movement in the United States has been undergoing a disagreement over tactics. Since \"Roe v. Wade\" was decided in 1973, the movement has usually focused on chipping away at \"Roe\" through incremental restrictions such as laws requiring parental consent or women to see sonograms, restricting late-term abortions, etc., with the goal of limiting abortions and changing \"hearts and minds\" until there is a majority on the Supreme Court to overturn \"Roe\". However, some activists are calling for \"an all-out legal assault on \"Roe. v. Wade\"\", seeking the enactment of laws defining legal personhood as beginning at fertilization or prohibiting abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detectable at six to eight weeks in the hope that court challenges to such laws would lead the Supreme Court to overturn \"Roe v. Wade\". They believe that Justice Anthony Kennedy, who nearly decided to overturn \"Roe\" in \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\", is open to rethinking \"Roe\". Others fear that the Court would not only strike down the laws in question but other state laws as well, and take the opportunity to solidify the ruling in \"Roe\". Evangelical Christian groups tend to be in the former camp and Catholic groups in the latter.\n\nStudies indicate that activists within the American anti-abortion movement are predominantly white and educated, with a majority of anti-abortion activism constituted by women. Scholars continue to dispute the primary factors that cause individuals to become anti-abortion activists. While some have suggested that a particular moral stance or worldview leads to activism, others have suggested that activism leads individuals to develop particular moral positions and worldviews.\n\nA 1981 survey of dues paying members of the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) by sociologist Donald O. Granberg found that survey respondents held conservative views on sex, sex education, and contraception. Additionally, Granberg's survey provided basic demographic characteristics of his sample: 98% of survey respondents were white, 63% were female, 58% had a college degree, and 70% were Catholic. Granberg concluded that conservative personal morality was the primary mechanism for explaining an individual's involvement in the anti-abortion movement.\n\nA 2002 study by Carol J.C. Maxwell drawing on decades of survey and interview data of direct-action activists within the anti-abortion movement found that 99% of the sample was white, 60% was female, 51% had a college degree, and 29% were Catholic. Like Granberg's 1981 study, Maxwell concluded that anti-abortion and pro-choice activists held two different worldviews which in turn are formed by two different moral centers.\n\nMore recently, sociologist Ziad Munson studied the characteristics of both activists and non-activists who considered themselves anti-abortion. The anti-abortion activists of Munson's sample were 93% white, 57% female, 66% Catholic, and 71% had a college degree. Of non-activists who considered themselves anti-abortion, Munson found that 83% were white, 52% were female, 45% were Catholic, and 76% had a college degree. In Munson's analysis personal moralities and worldviews are formed as a consequence of participation in anti-abortion activism. Munson's analysis differs from previous scholarly work in its assertion that beliefs result from activism rather than causing activism. For Munson, life course factors make an individual more or less likely to become an activist.\n\nAccording to a 2013 Gallup poll, fifteen percent of Americans with no religious identity are anti-abortion and slight majorities of Catholics, Protestants, Southerners, seniors and nonwhites reported as anti-abortion.\n\nAnti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\", and see the medical terms \"embryo\", \"zygote\", and \"fetus\" as dehumanizing.\n\nBoth \"pro-choice\" and \"pro-life\" are examples of terms labeled as political framing: they are terms which purposely try to define their philosophies in the best possible light, while by definition attempting to describe their opposition in the worst possible light. \"Pro-choice\" implies that the alternative viewpoint is \"anti-choice\", while \"pro-life\" implies the alternative viewpoint is \"pro-death\" or \"anti-life\". Some right-to-lifers use the term \"pro-abort\" to refer to pro-choice organizations and individuals.\n\nThe Associated Press encourages journalists to use the terms \"abortion rights\" and \"anti-abortion\". In a 2009 Gallup Poll, a majority of U.S. adults (51%) called themselves \"pro-life\" on the issue of abortion—for the first time since Gallup began asking the question in 1995—while 42% identified themselves as \"pro-choice\", although pro-choice groups noted that acceptance of the \"pro-life\" label did not in all cases indicate opposition to legalized abortion, and that another recent poll had indicated that an equal number were pro-choice. A March 2011 Rasmussen Reports poll concluded that Americans are \"closely divided between those who call themselves pro-life\" and those who consider themselves as \"pro-choice\". In a February 2011 Rasmussen Reports poll of \"Likely U.S. Voters\", fifty percent view themselves as\n\"pro-choice\" and forty percent \"say they are pro-life\". In a July 2013 Rasmussen Reports poll of \"Likely U.S. Voters\", 46 percent view themselves as \"pro-choice\" and 43 percent \"say they are pro-life\".\n\n\n\nIn the United States, some states issue specialty license plates that have an anti-abortion theme. Choose Life, an advocacy group founded in 1997, was successful in securing an anti-abortion automobile tag in Florida. Subsequently, the organization has been actively helping groups in other states pursue \"Choose Life\" license plates.\n\nSome anti-abortion organizations and individuals disseminate false medical information and unsupported pseudoscientific claims about alleged physical and mental health risks of abortion. Many right-to-life organizations claim that abortion damages future fertility, or causes breast cancer, which is contradicted by the medical professional organizations. Some states, such as Alaska, Mississippi, West Virginia, Texas, and Kansas, have passed laws requiring abortion providers to warn patients of a link between abortion and breast cancer, and to issue other scientifically unsupported warnings.\n\nSome right-to-life advocacy groups allege a link between abortion and subsequent mental-health problems. Some U.S. state legislatures have mandated that patients be told that abortion increases their risk of depression and suicide, despite the fact that such risks are not supported by the bulk of the scientific literature, and are contradicted by mainstream organizations of mental-health professionals such as the American Psychological Association.\n\nViolent incidents directed against abortion providers have included arson and bombings of abortion clinics, and murders or attempted murders of physicians and clinic staff, especially the doctors that provide abortions. Acts of violence against abortion providers and facilities in North America have largely subsided following a peak in the mid-1990s which included the murders of Drs. David Gunn, John Britton, and Barnett Slepian and the attempted murder of Dr. George Tiller. Tiller was murdered in his church in 2009.\n\nAs of 1995, nearly all anti-abortion leaders said that they condemned the use of violence in the movement, describing it as an aberration and saying that no one in their organizations was associated with acts of violence. There is, however, a small extremist fringe element of the right-to-life movement in the USA, which supports, raises money for, and attempts to justify anti-abortion violence, including murders of abortion workers, which the fringe element calls \"justifiable homicides\".\n\nAnti-abortion activists have been the targets of criminal intimidation and violence, including the murder of Jim Pouillon.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49358830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49358830", "title": "Uwe Gustafsson", "text": "Uwe Gustafsson\n\nUwe Gustafsson (born 1938) is a Canadian Missionary, Scholar, Linguist and social worker who stayed at Araku Valley of Vishakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh, South India for more than 43 years and changed the lives of more than 250,000 indigenous primitive tribal population (PTG) of Paderu Agency areas. Gustafsson compiled and written an Aadivasi Oriya-Telugu-English Dictionary and few scholastic and resourceful books and contributed to the work on Bible translation into Adivasi Oriya language. He worked primarily living at Araku Valley, Vishakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, South India. He also was a social reformer and activist who lived with the primitive tribes (then, now they are not to be called by the name “primitive”) and changed them positively towards development, income, livelihood and empowerment in many life-basics and MDG indicators. He was associated with Summer Institute of Linguistics.\n\nUwe Gustafsson spent his early years of childhood in Canada where he completed his both secular and theological studies. He was ambitious and enthusiastic for social reform and learning the indigenous culture, language and doing gospel works. His passion brought him to India; especially to the border areas of the states Andhra Pradesh and Orissa (now Odisha) where there were deep forests part of Eastern Ghats and forest dwelling/depending primitive tribes. There is still primitive-natured people living in the forests and the fringe villages and thus one can understand the situation some 43 years back and the same also exemplifies his dedication towards his passion.\n\nIn the first half of the 1960s Gustafsson came to India along with a team of social reformers and missionaries. Finding the backwardness, pathetic conditions and need of the forest-dwelling and depending tribal populations and their habitations, the team travelled to the forest areas of Aaraku Valley and Paderu in Vishakhapatnam. Owing to the hardships of living in the forest areas and the difficulties arisen, almost all the companions and members in the team had returned to their own hometowns. But he had stayed back and decided to work among the tribes and to help them in to have development in their socio-educational, health, livelihood and economical backwardness.\n\nIn Aaraku Valley, he, along with his family (His wife Elke and son Andrew) stayed in one of the tribal families’ house and started to study the culture, nature and language of the tribes. His principle intension in staying at Aaraku Valley with the tribals, was to script the oral languages of the tribes. There are over a 13 types of tribes occupying the Agency areas of Aaraku Valley extending to Paderu and the borders of Odisha state like Khonds, Koya and almost all of them speak the Adivasi Oriya dialect. During his stays’ initial years the tribal population was experiencing a lot of issues and problems in health, income, basic needs, food, livelihood, illiteracy, ignorance and social struggles too. He and his wife used to help the people in many ways; Mrs. Gustafsson ran a 24-hour medical clinic in their home to help the people even in the night. As his book of study \"Can Literacy Lead to Development?: A Case Study in Literacy, Adult Education, and Economic Development in India\" says, he started a mobile schooling programme; a bilingual literacy programme. Under the programme, every year, they trained 100 Adivasi Oriya-speaking people to give night classes in 100 villages in and around the Araku Valley and thus both the Gustafssons’ effort reached a coverage of 5000 km area and total population of more than 12,000 men and women making them literate. Such activities became routine in both the Gustafssons’ life and along with that he separated time to study the Adivasi Oriya Language.\n\nThough the Adivasi Oriya-Telugu Language was the language for the tribes for thousands of years had been spoken and the other languages of the states in which they live have scripts; Telugu and Oriya, but they had no even script. So his next effort was to find a script for the Adivasi Oriya language, which is an Indo-Aryan language. So he studied the script and sounds of another local language to re-apply to Adivasi Oriya. With a vision to help the tribal peoples to coalescence with the wider population, he chose Telugu, the state language of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, in which states most of the Adivasi – Oriya language spoken tribes live. Thus it took 20 years of tremendous and hard work even without computers or any such advanced devices, but using only two old type writers and with the help of two tribal people to assist him. By 2002 he had written, compiled and published a variety of scholarly books including \"Adivasi Oriya Language Script (Using Telugu Script)\", \"Adivasi Oriya-Telugu-English Dictionary\", English–Adivasi Oriya vocabularies, and \"Kotiya–Oriya Phonetic Summary\". Among them the \"Adivasi Oriya-Telugu-English dictionary, a 1,047-page opus is the great work of Gustafsson in India, for it is the only basic for the tribal children and others’ study and reference and is the written preservation of a language or an oral tongue, spoken over thousands years as mother tongue of one of the major tribal populations in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.\n\nFinding the need for an exclusive participation, oneness, social bonding and common platform and the literacy, livelihood and other developmental activities further, it was he and his wife established the AASSAV (Aadivasi Abhivrudhi Samskrithika Sangam Aaraku Valley). Though the society AASSAV was started in the late 1980s, the income generation and livelihood activities of AASSAV was started much earlier onwards by Gustafssons. Major income generation activities introduced and carried out by ASSAV includes coffee cultivation, black pepper cultivation, cardamom, beekeeping, printing press etc. and a variety of additional activities too having a headquarters at Humbriguda, Araku valley over an eight-acre campus, where it has all basic infrastructure, shops and machineries too. It was he who introduced coffee and black pepper cultivation over the Agency areas and AASSAV's coffee-growing ventures expanded staff enrolling 1,000 tribal farmers in 80 different villages to use their one-acre plots to grow organic coffee thus restoring Aaraku Valley to once blanketed by lush green jungle. Besides providing jobs, the annual profit of the society is being shared among the tribal population. It also helped to develop and safe-guard the degraded, dessertified and eroded lands due to the “cut & carry” destruction of forests, trees, animals by the tribal population in ignorance. Now Aaraku Valley ranks as one of the main coffee-pepper growing areas in the south as well as the whole India AASSAV now directly provides works, income and livelihood to more than 900 tribal people through its income generation projects. And later AASSAV invited another organization (Naandi) to tie-up with them in coffee production, processing and marketing.\n\nSome of the major works and books of Gustafsson in India, besides his other numerous articles and publishing: \nOther areas of Uwe Gustafssons contributions in India is the translation of Bible into Adivasi Oriya Language for which he developed and compiled The Great and only Adivasi Oriya –Telugu-English Dictionary.

Lowdermilk\n\nWalter Clay Lowdermilk (July 1, 1888 – May 6, 1974) was a soil conservationist who worked in countries throughout the world to help protect and reclaim lands in order to better feed their population. Lowdermilk worked with the Belgian Relief Effort (B.R.E., active 1914-16 in Belgium and France) after World War I, in China in the 1920s to help avert famine, with the Soil Conservation Service, in fascist Italy in the 1930s, in the United States, and in Mandatory Palestine planning land and water use.\n\nIn the latter he was impressed by the advanced techniques that the Zionist settlers, and later the State of Israel, took to develop water efficient agriculture and land use. A 1944 outline of local water development became known as the \"Lowdermilk plan\" and was of importance for the later National Water Carrier of Israel.\n\nWalter Clay Lowdermilk was named a Rhodes Scholar in 1911, attending Oxford after his undergraduate education at the University of Arizona. He married Inez Marks in August 1922. They had two children: Winifred Esther Lowdermilk (married Wilmot N. Hess) and William Francis Lowdermilk (deceased). Lowdermilk received his PhD from the University of California in 1929.\nHe served in World War I as an engineer and in the Belgian Relief Commission (1917 - 1918). He has been active as Flood control engineer and scientist in China and was Assistant Chief of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, US Department of Agriculture. He served as a President of the American Geophysical Union (1941-1944).\n\nLowdermilk's assumptions about soil conservation had a strong focus on cultural background. He was a conservationist influenced by George Perkins Marsh.\n\nHis public speeches and popular books contained various allegation to religious and historical evidence and legends. Compare:\n\n\"Thou shalt inherit the holy earth as a faithful steward conserving its resources and productivity from generation to generation. Thou shalt safeguard thy fields from soil erosion, thy living waters from drying up, thy forests from desolation, and protect thy hills from overgrazing by the herds, that thy descendants may have abundance forever. If any shall fail in this stewardship of the land, thy fruitful fields shall become sterile stony ground or wasting gullies, and thy descendants shall decrease and live in poverty or perish from off the face of the earth.\n\n\"The Eleventh Commandment\" written and broadcast over the radio by Dr. Lowdermilk in Jerusalem during June 1939 was dedicated to the Palestinian Jewish villages whose good stewardship of the earth inspired this idea.\" \"Palestine, Land of Promise\" (1944) is one of his books. One of his pamphlets, \"Conquest of the Land Through Seven Thousand Years\", was copied in the millions.\n\nHe was quite positive about the Italian (fascist) land reclamation projects in the Pontine Marshes in Italy, which was, in the early stages of the New deal and before Italy–United States relations degradeted, rather common for especially democratic leaning Americans.\n\nIn 1940 he provided a rather critical review of the White Paper of 1939. He cited the dire fate of mostly Christian Assyrians in Iraq (compare Iraq Levies) after the British left the former mandate. Lowdermilk assumed, that the Jews in the then Palestine Mandate region 'would be massacred' similarly by Muslims, if left as a minority. Lowdermilk and his wife Inez, themselves gentiles, supported the Zionist cause and Jewish settlements in Palestine. He was quite optimistic about the absorptive capacity of the region for enhanced settlements.\n\nA water development project outlined by him became later known as the \"Lowdermilk plan\" The Plan was recommended by the United States in 1944 and is still of importance for the later National Water Carrier of Israel. Parts of it, as the use of the Litani River to irrigate the Negev desert have been controversial. As early as 1946 the Church of Scotland presbytery in Jerusalem submitted a memorandum against the plan, as they feared it would spoil the sanctity of the Sea of Galilee. The suggestion of refilling the Dead Sea through a Mediterranean–Dead Sea Canal was based on earlier approaches and is still of importance.\n\nLowdermilk Department of Agricultural Engineering at Technion University in Israel is named in his honor, \"the world-renowned American expert on soil conservation, who supported the development of the State of Israel, and guided and inspired this Department from its first days.\" He was Fellow of the American Geophysical Union, 1962.\n\n\n"}

The statue stands at around 2.09 m. It was discovered accidentally in 1934 by a labourer ploughing the field in the Italian town of Capestrano, along with a female statue in civilian attire, called \"Lady of Capestrano\".\n\n\"The Warrior\" statue has traces of pink paint, and features a warrior wearing a hat with a huge brim, and a disk-type armor (\"kardiophylax\") protecting his chest and back, a wide belt, necklace, and armlets. Additionally, the warrior bears a short sword, knife, axe, and a defensive device known to the Greeks as \"mitra\" (a short apron covering the back).\n\nA South Picene inscription incised on the pillar standing to the right of the warrior reads: \"Makupri koram opsút aninis rakinevíi pomp[úne]í\" (\"Aninis had this statue made most excellently for Rakinewis, the Pomp[onian]\").\n\nInvestigation subsequent to the statue's discovery revealed that the vineyard where the statue was found was situated above an Iron Age cemetery.\n"}
{"id": "54593999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54593999", "title": "Zbyněk Zbyslav Stránský", "text": "Zbyněk Zbyslav Stránský\n\nZbyněk Zbyslav Stránský (26 October 1926- 21 January 2016), was a Czech museologist, considered the “father of scientific museology”. Between the years 1960 and 1970, he was responsible for one of the first attempts to structure a theoretical basis for museology, when directing the Department of Museology of the Moravian Museum, in Brno. With the support of the museum director, Jan Jelínek, he founded a School of museological thinking in Brno, aiming to connect museum practice to a specific theoretical system. Zbyněk Z. Stránský, as he used to sign his texts, was the pioneer in the construction of a museology that is conceived as social science, creating an autonomous system of thought based on specific concepts.\n\nBorn in Kutná Hora, the old Czechoslovakia, in 26 October 1926, Zbyněk Z. Stránský studied history and philosophy at Charles University, in Prague, from 1946 to 1950. During the 1950s, he worked in several Czech museums and in 1962 he was appointed the head of the innovative Department of Museology of the Moravian Museum and the J. E. Purkyně University, in Brno, in which he has established, under the influence of Jan Jelínek  (1926-2004), the museum director, the first teaching school of museology devoted to museological theory in the world. Already in the 1960s and 1970s, Stránský was considered the leading person of the Central-European museological school.\n\nBetween 1980 and 1990, Stránský was an active participant of the International Committee for Museology – ICOFOM, of the International Council of Museums – ICOM, being in charge, from 1985, of the terminological project that aimed to create a Treaty of Museology and a \"Dictionarium Museologicum\". Until the beginning of the 1990s, ICOFOM has expressed its mission to “establish museology as a scientific discipline”. Stránský has continually influenced this committee and participated in several of its meetings, becoming an elected member of its executive board in 1986.\n\nThroughout his whole career, Zbyněk Z. Stránský worked to establish a complete and coherent training in museology, aiming to secure a place for museologists as thinkers and researchers. In 1962, a few professionals from the Moravian Museum created the Department of Museology, institutionally connected both to the museum and to J. E. Purkyně University, establishing a line of museological training that was going to be characterized as the “Brno School”. The craved transformation envisaged “making a real profession of museum work”.\n\nOn 20 June 1968, the students of the first class of museology received their university diplomas in Brno. As reported by Stránský, most of them were museum directors or professionals who already had a degree in another disciplinary field. The museology course had the duration of two years, with four sessions composed of one hundred lessons each, including theoretical courses and practical lessons. The themes of the classes were divided between general museology and special museology.\n\nIn the year of 1986, his training program in museology, in Brno, would gain an increasing number of new followers from every part of the world, with the creation of his International Summer School of Museology – ISSOM. Inside the structure of the so-called Masaryk University  and with the support of UNESCO, the ISSOM lasted until the year 1999, disseminating the theoretical knowledge of Museology. In 1998, Stránský leaves the city of Brno to live in Banská Bystrica, a city of Slovakia, where he has created the Department of Ecomuseology, which he would coordinate.\n\nStránský continued to teach Museology at the University of Matej Bel, in Banská Bystrica, until the year 2002. In the following years, he returned to Brno as an invited lecturer. Stránský continued to publish texts on the Theory of Museology, trying to reaffirm and adapt his structured system for this science until the first decade of this century. He passed away in Banská Bystrica, on the 21 January 2016.\n\nMuseology, a term that acquired different connotations throughout the 20th century and even before, thanks to the attempt to obtain academic legitimacy by some Czech museum professionals, it would gain a new dimension, from the 1960s, either as a science or as an autonomous disciplinary field, providing the necessary bases for museum work.\n\nIn his structural theory, Stránský was committed to the investigation of essential points considered by him as indispensable for the constitution of a scientific discipline:\n\n\nThe search for scientific legitimation, thus, should be followed by the concomitant construction of a theoretical system of museology accordingly to the framework of contemporary sciences.\n\nIn the context of the 1960s, Stránský has appointed that there were objective reasons for the “birth of museology as a science”, however, its internal prerequisite, i.e., the logical structure, was inexistent. His question on the character of museology, then, made him think on the theoretical base of the very theory. In other words, Stránský has built a metatheoretical problematic as the starting point for structuring the scientific discipline, introducing the notion of metamuseology.  The term designates “the theory whose subject is museology in itself”, in a certain way being strictly bound to museology, but also related to philosophy, to history and to the theory of science and culture.\n\nIn his metamuseological approach, the first problem raised concerned museology's subject of study. Stránský proposed some disconcerting questions for the field under development. With his initial declaration, in which he denies the museum as the scientific subject, the author opens the way towards a long process of self-reflection that marked museology in its bases in Eastern Europe.\n\nBy stating that the “subject of museology is not and cannot be the museum”, Stránský intended to separate the “instrument” – or the means, i.e., the museum – and the “end” to which it serves. He alleges, in effect, what could have been considered obvious in the context of post-war museums, which is the fact that the museum, as an institution that serves to a certain end, could not be the study subject of a science. Nevertheless, and in a tautological approach, according to some of his critics, he would propose that museology's subject of study should be searched in the very museum work, in the “systematic and critical” task of producing the museum object or \"musealia\", in Stranskian terminology.\n\nThis thinker was, then, responsible for the dislocation of museology's subject from the museum, as a historic institution, to museality – understood as a “specific documentary value”. This last concept, central to his theory, would lead Stránský to conceive the cognitive intention of museology as the scientific interpretation of an “attitude of man to reality”. In his opinion, this seizing of the museum character of things, which he called “museality”, must be “in the center of the gnoseological intention of museology” as this discipline's scientific task, delimiting its position within the system of sciences.\n\nHence, the concept of museality (\"“muzealita”\"), understood as the “quality” or “value” of musealia, appeared in Stránský's works in 1970, being proposed as museology's true subject of study. The first attempts to define the term, however, have presented logical problems.\n\nThe museologist from the ancient German Democratic Republic, Klaus Schreiner, for instance, hasn’t conceived museality as the property of an object as such but as something that is attributed to the object only in the context of a particular, specialized discipline. According to Schreiner, there cannot be a value “in itself” and the concept of museality in the Stranskian sense is the product of a “bourgeois-imperialist axiology”. He considers that the philosophical value propagated is “timeless, classness and generally not human” and that, as such, it “absolutizes the bourgeois class interests”. As noted by Peter Van Mensch, Stránský would modify the concept of museality over the years, changing its sense from a value category to the “specific value orientation” itself.\n\nThere can be appointed several influences to the work of Zbyněk Z. Stránský. However, not all of them can be attested with direct citation in his texts. Some authors will suppose, for instance, that the knowledge of studies by the Belgian Paul Otlet on Bibliology would have influenced Stranskian thinking on scientific museology. In his theoretical texts, it is possible to note, among the most quoted authors, the Czechs Jiři Neustupný and Josef Beneš, as well as the Russian Awraam M. Razgon. It must be acknowledged, still, the fundamental support of the Czechs Jan Jelínek and Vinoš Sofka who have contributed to the dialogues established between Stránský and the international context of museology through his insertion in ICOFOM and the creation of ISSOM.\n\nThe referencial thinking of Stránský for Central and Eastern Europe would be cited in publications mainly since the 1970s, by authors such as the Russian A. M. Razgon, the British Geoffrey D. Lewis, the German, from the GDR, Klaus Schreiner, the Czech Anna Gregorová, the Brazilian Waldisa Rússio, and the Dutch Peter van Mensch, among others.\n\nIn the years 1990, several museology authors, from the connection with Stránský and his works in ICOFOM and ISSOM, would take his own interpretations from the reflections he initiated assimilating their own ideas to the thinking in their respective countries; this would be the case, for instance, of Bernard Deloche, in France, and Tereza Scheiner, in Brazil.\n\nIn general, even if some Anglo-Saxon museologists try to reduce the discipline to a set of techniques, those from the countries located in the ancient Eastern Europe, such as Anna Gregorová and Klaus Schreiner, define it as a science under construction. In effect, the first critics to this conception are Kenneth Hudson (UK) and George E. Burcaw (United States), so that the more theoretical approach to museology, from Stránský, was followed by authors in countries with a bigger tendency to theorization: the German and Latin schools, as well as Latin America.\n\nAuthors such as the Dutch Peter van Mensch proposed to structure the discipline based on the model initiated by Stránský. He understood museology according to five aspects: general museology, theoretical museology (or matamuseology, for Stránský), special museology, historic museology and applied museology. To these five aspects Stránský would propose to include social museology, to study the phenomenon of musealization in current societies. Furthermore, Peter van Mensch would amplify his reflection on the professionalization of museology. He proposes the PRC model (Preservation, Research and Communication), based on the recognition of the discipline as a true science.\n\nAccording to the de spirit of the Declaration of Santiago of Chile (1972), and with the goal to decentralize the action of the International Committee for Museology, it is created in 1986, the Regional Subcommittee of ICOFOM for Latin America and the Caribbean – ICOFOM LAM, conceived by Nelly Decarolis (Argentina) and Tereza Scheiner (Brazil). The scientific profile of the field and the theoretical reflections would be reaffirmed, considered as central matters for the Region. However, Tereza Scheiner and Luciana Menezes de Carvalho (Brazil) pointed out that, differentiating itself from Stránský, “museology has the character of a theory, but not of a science”.\n\nParticularly in the context of Brazil, the theoretical perspective developed by Stránský was introduced in the country in the 1980s, mainly in the works of Waldisa Rússio (in São Paulo) and Tereza Scheiner (in Rio de Janeiro), both responsible for the creation of “schools” based on this author's thinking and marked by the configuration of museology as a science.\n\nIn 1993, with the work “De museologica” (manuscript), Stránský received the title of Associated Professor (in the Czech language, Docent).\n\nIn 1996, getting the title of regular professor, he rejected it with the justification that museology is not an official credential Science.\n\nIn 2006, Stránský was given the Silver medal of Masaryk University from the hands of the rector Petr Fiala.\n\nIn Brazil, with the support of ICOFOM, an homage for Stránský was organized by the Universidade Federal do Estado do Rio de Janeiro – UNIRIO, in the III Debates Cicle of the Museology School, organized in October, 2015, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of Stránský's declaration on museology's study subject, in 1965.\n\nIn 2015, the Regional Subcommittee of ICOFOM to Latin America and the Caribbean – ICOFOM LAM has dedicated the year for the work of Stránský and his influence in the Region, in the occasion of the XXIII Annual Meeting of ICOFOM LAM, in Panama City.\n\nAfter his death, in 2016, the Czech journal Museologica Brunensia is organizing a special issue dedicated to Zbyněk Z.
