This is distinct from grammatical gender as it does not involve marking nouns for gender; it is also distinct from gender-specific pronouns, such as English \"he/she\" or Japanese \"boku\" (\"I\", used by males) and \"atashi\" (\"I\", used by females). In Basque, allocutive agreement involves the grammatical marking of the gender of the addressee in the verb form itself.\n\nGrammatically this is done by introducing an additional second person marker in the verb form (marked ):\n\nversus\n\nEastern dialects have expanded on this by adding the polite (formerly plural) pronoun \"zu\" to the system; in some, hypocoristic palatalization converts this to \"-xu\":\n\nSome varieties have done away with the unmarked forms except in subordinate clauses: \"joanen nuk / nun / nuzu\" vs. \"joanen nizela\" 'that I go'\n\nBeja, a Cushitic language, has allocutive forms, marking the gender of a masculine addressee with the clitic \"=a\" and with \"=i\" for feminine addressees, for example \"rihja=heːb=a\" \"He saw me\" (said to a man) vs. \"rihja=heːb=i\" \"He saw me\" (said to a woman).\n\n\n"}

The site was inhabited mainly by Totonacs, Chinantecas and Zapotecs. It was one of the most important Totonac settlements during the postclassical Mesoamerican period and the capital of the kingdom of Totonacapan. It is located one kilometer from the shore of the Actopan River and six kilometres from the coast.\n\nAccording to some sources, the city was founded at least 1,500 years before the Spanish arrival, and there is evidence of Olmec influence. Although not much is known about the Preclassical and Classic Era, the Preclassical town was built on mounds to protect it from floods. The Totonacs moved into the area during the Toltec Empire peak, having been forced out of their settlements on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The Totonacs ruled the area of Totonacapan which consisted of the northern part of Veracruz together with the Zacatlán district of Puebla with a total population of approximately 250,000 and some 50 towns. At its peak, Cempoala had a population of between 25,000 and 30,000.\n\nThe word \"Cēmpoalli\" (from Nahuatl root \"Cēmpoal) means twenty and \"ā (tl)\", means water, hence \"twenty waters\". An alternative etymology suggests the name meant “Abundant Water”. Both versions imply that the city had many aqueducts which fed the numerous gardens and surrounding farmland fields. A third version conjectures that the name referred to commercial activities which, according to some sources, were performed every 20 days in pre-Hispanic times. \n\nResearch by Vincent H. Malmström (Dartmouth College) describes an interesting astronomical relationship between the three round rings found at Cempoala.\n\nThe Totonacs moved onto this coastal plain during the height of the Toltec Empire (A.D. 1000-1150). Archaeologists believe the Toltecs had pushed the Totonacs out of their settlements on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Madre Oriental and down to the coast.\n\nCempoala lies on the flat coastal plain about six kilometers from the Gulf and a little more than a kilometer from the banks of the Rio Actopan (also called the Rio Chachalacas).\n\nCempoala and other coastal Veracruz locations were defeated by the Aztec armies of Moctezuma I (mid-15th century). They were heavily taxed (goods and sacrifice prisoners) and forced them to send hundreds of people as a tribute for sacrifices and as slaves. This condition treatment at the hands of the Aztecs created the situation which led up to the defeat of the Aztecs by Cortez in the 16th century.\n\nWhen the Spaniards lead by Hernan Cortes arrived in 1519, the Totonacs had been suffering Aztec domination for several years.\n\nThe Spaniards heard of a town on the way named Zempoala while at their malaria-ridden camp of San Juan de Ulua. They marched over and sent word of their arrival, and upon their arrival were met by 20 Zempoalan dignitaries.\n\nIn town, they met with \"Fat Chief\" Xicomecoatl, who fed them and gave them quarters. The Totonac presented Cortez with numerous gifts, including gold jewelry.\n\nXicomecoatl made many complaints against the Aztec Empire and the great Montezuma.\n\nCortez promised alleviate his concerns. At Quiahuiztlan, the Spaniards and Totonacs forged their alliance against the Aztecs.\n\nSpaniards and Totonacs had the same fate. In August 1519, Cortés and 40 Totonac captains, which by a lower estimate equates to around 8000 soldiers, and 400 porters left for Tenochtitlan. The effort ended with the fall of Tenochtitlan and Moctezuma II, the Aztec Tlatoani, as hostage.\n\nThe site buildings show impressive squares and fortresses’ surrounded by vegetation which permanently covers this area, called \"Place of accounts\", as was called the Mexica rulers, because it was here where all taxes and tributes from the region were collected.\n\nWhat today is the archaeological site had been the most important political-religious center of the city, whose constructions were made with river stones, jointed with mortar and flattened with the lime produced from burning shells and snails, obtaining in this way that buildings shone from far away as if they were built in silver.\n\nThe urban Cempoala complex includes several buildings and major architectural structures, not only by its construction, but by its historic importance, often unknown, as for example, in the part of the site now known as walled system IV, Cortés successfully faced the forces of Pánfilo de Narváez, thus consolidating his leadership in the colonization of the Mexican territory.\n\nThe main structures at Cempoala, include the following:\n\nOr Sun Temple built on the same platform as the Templo Mayor, separated by an ample square. This is probably the most impressive structure on site. The great temple resembles the Sun Temple in Tenochtitlan. The Quetzalcoatl Temple, the Feathered Serpent God is a square platform, and the Ehécatl Temple, the wind God is round.\n\nThe top part is surrounded by battlements.\n\nOr chimney temple, has a series of semicircular pillars 1.5 meters high, because of this peculiar shape, the building is named.\n\nIt has a three bodied structure, its most notable feature is its exterior decor based on skulls representations.\n\nNo information\n\nOr cross temple, maintains some fresco mural sections with celestial motifs.\n\nThe so-called Temple of Charity standing about 200 meters to the east is a two-tier structure decorated with fragments of stucco reliefs. It is named for the hundreds of stucco skulls that once adorned the facade of a small structure at the base of the temple's staircase-archaeologists believe this complex was dedicated to the god of death.\n\nIt consists of two overlaid basements with top side elements, an open room, two decorative belts, the lower has murals depicting the sun, Moon and Venus, as early morning star, the higher section has a large amount of clay “little faces” or little skulls. The Structure is decorated with stucco faces on the walls and hieroglyphs painted in lower sections Gran Pirámide and the wind god Ehécatl worship altar.\nThere are other mounds, unexcavated, that cannot be visited, located within Cempoala current houses. Some of the structures there are probably built in the same style as were the residences of the prehispanic commoners.\n\nSome research by Vincent H. Malmström of Dartmouth College describes an interesting astronomical relationship that exists because of the three round rings found at Zempoala. We will quote a part of his discussion concerning the Three Ceremonial Rings of Zempoala.\n\nBeneath the massive pyramid (north eastern corner) in the central plaza of Zempoala, are three puzzling stone rings, each made from rounded beach cobbles jointed together to make small, stepped pillars. The largest rings has 40 stepped pillars, the middle ring has 28, and the smaller ring 13, around its circumference. It seems that three rings were used to calibrate different astronomical cycles, possibly by placing a marker or an idol from one pillar to the next, day after day.\n\nThe stone rings viewed from the top of the main pyramid, are surmounted by 13, 28, and 40 step like pillars, might have been counting devices to keep track of eclipse cycles, by Totonac priests.\n\nIt is possible that by using the rings, Totonacs priests were able to calibrate movements of the moon. There are reasons to believe these rings provide further evidence of the intellectual curiosity and architectural ingenuity of the early Mesoamericans.\"\n\nCempoala was a prosperous city in 1519, in which the Spaniards under Hernan Cortes arrived in Mexico and established alliances with some groups to go towards the capture of Tenochtitlan, the city of Cempoala then numbered approximately 20,000 inhabitants and was the most important ceremonial and commercial center of the Aztec empire, more so than Tlatelolco, the Spaniards called it in Villa Viciosa, meaning fertile village by the many festivals and vast orchards and gardens available and festive and joyful inhabitants character, was later known as new Seville for its resemblance, as per the spaniards, with the Iberian town. \n\nBetween 1575 and 1577 a smallpox (matlazahuatl) epidemic decimated the population, it is estimated that two million people lost their lives in Mesoamerica, the city was totally abandoned, and the few survivors moved to the city of Xalapa, eventually fell into oblivion, until archeologist Francisco del Paso and Troncoso rediscovered it.\n\nAfter the victory and conquest, the Cempoala Totonacs soon took their new destiny next to their foreign partners: were re-located and had to leave the city as they were Christianized, banned from practicing their ancient cults and were turned into slaves to work new Spanish sugar cane fields.\n\nCortés first arrived at Zempoala in 1519 with 500 conquistadores who then made a long trip up into the highlands using the same routes used to haul maize to Tenochtitlan. His was added by the lord of Cempoala, known by his extraordinary corpulence as the \"fat Cacique\". The town was settled around walled perimeters delimiting temples and palaces; dating back to the 11th to 16th centuries.\n\nArchaeology of Native North America, 2010, Dean R.

It is sometimes necessary in communication (for example, to avoid lexical gaps that would cause untranslatability), but it can also be undesirable (when an uncommon or easily misunderstood figure of speech is used). Roundabout speech is the use of many words to describe something that already has a common and concise term (for example, saying \"a tool used for cutting things such as paper and hair\" instead of \"scissors\"). Most dictionaries use circumlocution to define words. Circumlocution is often used by people with aphasia and people learning a new language, where simple terms can be paraphrased to aid learning or communication (for example, paraphrasing the word \"grandfather\" as \"the father of one's father\"). Euphemism, innuendo and equivocation are different forms of circumlocution.\n\n\"Euphemistic language\" often uses circumlocution to avoid saying words that are taboo or considered offensive. For example, \"Holy mother of Jesus!\" is a circumlocution of \"Mary!\", but \"heck\", while still euphemistic, is not a circumlocution of \"hell\".\n\nEuphemistic circumlocution is also used to avoid saying \"unlucky words\"—words which are taboo for reasons connected with superstition: for example, calling the devil \"Old Nick\", calling Macbeth \"the Scottish Play\" or saying \"baker's dozen\" instead of thirteen.\n\n\"Innuendo\" refers to something suggested but not explicitly stated.\n\n\"Equivocation\" is the use of ambiguous language to avoid telling the truth or forming commitments. \n\n\n"}

{"id": "12207045", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12207045", "title": "Foreclosure (psychoanalysis)", "text": "Foreclosure (psychoanalysis)\n\nForeclosure (also known as \"foreclusion\"; ) is the English translation of a term that the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan introduced into psychoanalysis to identify a specific psychical cause for psychosis. \n\nAccording to Élisabeth Roudinesco, the term was originally introduced into psychology 'in 1928, when Édouard Pichon published, in Pierre Janet's review, his article on \"The Psychological Significance of Negation in French\": \"...[and] borrowed the legal term \"forclusif\" to indicate facts that the speaker no longer sees as part of reality'.\n\nAccording to Christophe Laudou, the term was introduced by Damourette and Pichon. \n\nThe publication took part against the background of the Twenties dispute between Freud and René Laforgue over scotomization. 'If I am not mistaken', Freud wrote in 1927, 'Laforgue would say in this case that the boy \"scotomizes\" his perception of the woman's lack of a penis. A new technical term is justified when it describes a new fact or emphasizes it. This is not the case here'. Freud went on to suggest that if one wanted to 'reserve the word \"Verdrängung\" [\"repression\"] for the affect, then the correct German word for the vicissitude of the idea would be \"Verleugnung\" [\"disavowal\"]'.\n\nIn 1938 Lacan relates the origin of psychosis to an exclusion of the father from the family structure thereby reducing this structure to a mother-child relationship. Later on, when working on the distinctions between the real, imaginary and symbolic father, he specifies that it is the absence of the symbolic father which is linked to psychosis.\n\nLacan uses the Freudian term, \"Verwerfung\", which the \"Standard Edition\" translates as \"repudiation\", as a specific defence mechanism different from repression, \"Verdrängung\", in which \"the ego rejects the incompatible idea together with its affect and behaves as if the idea has never occurred to the ego at all.\" In 1954 basing himself on a reading of the \"Wolf Man\" Lacan identifies \"Verwerfung\" as the specific mechanism of psychosis where an element is rejected outside the symbolic order as if it has never existed. In 1956 in his Seminar on Psychoses he translates \"Verwerfung\" as \"forclusion\", that is foreclosure. \"Let us extract from several of Freud's texts a term that is sufficiently articulated in them to designate in them a function of the unconscious that is distinct from the repressed. Let us take as demonstrated the essence of my Seminar on the Psychoses, namely, that this term refers to psychosis: this term is \"Verwerfung\" (foreclosure)\".\n\nThe problematic Lacan sought to address with the twin tools of foreclosure and the signifier was that of the difference between psychosis and neurosis, as manifested in and indicated by language usage. It was common analytic ground that \"when psychotics speak they always have some meanings that are too fixed, and some that are far too loose, they have a different relation to language, and a different way of speaking from neurotics.\" Freud, following Bleuler and Jung had pointed to 'a number of changes in \"speech\"...in schizophrenics...\"words\" are subjected to the same process as that which makes the dream'. Lacan used foreclosure to explain why.\n\nWhen Lacan first uses the Freudian concept of \"Verwerfung\" (repudiation) in his search for a specific mechanism for psychosis, it is not clear what is repudiated (castration, speech). It is in 1957 in his article \"On a question preliminary to any possible treatment of psychosis\" that he advances the notion that it is the Name-of-the-Father (a fundamental signifier) that is the object of foreclosure. In this way Lacan combines two of his main themes on the causality of psychosis: the absence of the father and the concept of \"Verwerfung\". This ideas remains central to Lacan's thinking on psychosis throughout the rest of his work.\n\nLacan considered the father to play a vital role in breaking the initial mother/child duality and introducing the child to the wider world of culture, language, institutions and social reality — the Symbolic world — the father being \"the human being who stands for the law and order that the mother plants in the life of the child...widens the child's view of the world.\" The result in normal development is \"proper separation from the mother, as marked out by the Names-of-the-father.\" Thus Lacan postulates the existence of a paternal function (the \"Name of the Father\" or \"primordial signifier\") which allows the realm of the Symbolic to be bound to the realms of the Imaginary and the Real. This function prevents the developing child from being engulfed by its mother and allows him/her to emerge as a separate entity in his/her own right. It is a symbol of parental authority (a general symbol that represents the power of father of the Oedipus complex) that brings the child into the realm of the Symbolic by forcing him/her to act and to verbalise as an adult. As a result, the three realms are integrated in a way that is conducive to the creation of meaning and successful communication by means of what Lacan calls a Borromean knot.\n\nWhen the Name-of-the-Father is foreclosed for a particular subject, it leaves a hole in the Symbolic order which can never be filled. The subject can then be said to have a psychotic structure, even if he shows none of the classical signs of psychosis. When the foreclosed Name-of-the-Father re-appears in the Real, the subject is unable to assimilate it and the result of this collision between the subject and the inassimilable signifier of the Name-of-the-father is the entry into psychosis proper characterized by the onset of hallucinations and/or delusions. In other words, when the paternal function is \"foreclosed\" from the Symbolic order, the realm of the Symbolic is insufficiently bound to the realm of the Imaginary and failures in meaning may occur (the Borromean knot becomes undone and the three realms completely disconnected), with \"a disorder caused at the most personal juncture between the subject and his sense of being alive.\" Psychosis is experienced after some environmental sign in the form of a signifier which the individual cannot assimilate is triggered, and this entails that \"the Name-of-the-Father, is foreclosed, \"verworfen\", is called into symbolic opposition to the subject.\" The fabric of the individual's reality is ripped apart and no meaningful Symbolic sense can be made of experience. \"Absence of transcendence of the Oedipus places the subject under the regime of foreclosure or non-distinction between the symbolic and the real'; and psychotic delusions or hallucinations are the consequent result of the individual's striving to account for what he/she experiences.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1565418", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1565418", "title": "Geometric abstraction", "text": "Geometric abstraction\n\nGeometric abstraction is a form of abstract art based on the use of geometric forms sometimes, though not always, placed in non-illusionistic space and combined into non-objective (non-representational) compositions. Although the genre was popularized by avant-garde artists in the early twentieth century, similar motifs have been used in art since ancient times.\n\nGeometric abstraction is present among many cultures throughout history both as decorative motifs and as art pieces themselves. Islamic art, in its prohibition of depicting religious figures, is a prime example of this geometric pattern-based art, which existed centuries before the movement in Europe and in many ways influenced this Western school. Aligned with and often used in the architecture of Islamic civilations spanning the 7th century-20th century, geometric patterns were used to visually connect spirituality with science and art, both of which were key to Islamic thought of the time.\n\nThroughout 20th-century art historical discourse, critics and artists working within the reductive or pure strains of abstraction have often suggested that geometric abstraction represents the height of a non-objective art practice, which necessarily stresses or calls attention to the root plasticity and two-dimensionality of painting as an artistic medium. Thus, it has been suggested that geometric abstraction might function as a solution to problems concerning the need for modernist painting to reject the illusionistic practices of the past while addressing the inherently two dimensional nature of the picture plane as well as the canvas functioning as its support. Wassily Kandinsky, one of the forerunners of pure non-objective painting, was among the first modern artists to explore this geometric approach in his abstract work. Other examples of pioneer abstractionists such as Kasimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian have also embraced this approach towards abstract painting. Mondrian's painting \"Composition No. 10\" (1939–1942) clearly defines his radical but classical approach to the construction of horizontal and vertical lines, as Mondrian wrote, \"constructed with awareness, but not with calculation, led by high intuition, and brought to harmony and rhythm.\"\n\nJust as there are both two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries, the abstract sculpture of the 20th century was of course no less affected than painting by geometricizing tendencies. Georges Vantongerloo and Max Bill, for example, are perhaps best known for their geometric sculpture, although both of them were also painters; and indeed, the ideals of geometric abstraction find nearly perfect expression in their titling (e.g., Vantongerloo's \"Construction in the Sphere\") and pronouncements (e.g., Bill's statement that \"I am of the opinion that it is possible to develop an art largely on the basis of mathematical thinking.\") Expressionist abstract painting, as practiced by artists such as Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Clyfford Still, and Wols, represents the opposite of geometric abstraction.\n\nAbstract art has also historically been likened to music in its ability to convey emotional or expressive feelings and ideas without reliance upon or reference to recognizable objective forms already existent in reality. Wassily Kandinsky has discussed this connection between music and painting, as well as how the practice of classical composition had influenced his work, at length in his seminal essay \"Concerning the Spiritual in Art\".\n\n\n"}

Paul Getty Trust. It is headquartered at the Getty Center but also has facilities at the Getty Villa, and commenced operation in 1985. The GCI is a private international research institution dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. It \"serves the conservation community through scientific research, education and training, model field projects, and the dissemination of the results of both its own work and the work of others in the field\" and \"adheres to the principles that guide the work of the Getty Trust: service, philanthropy, teaching, and access.\" GCI has activities in both art conservation and architectural conservation.\n\nGCI conducts scientific research related to art conservation. It offers formal education and training programs, and it has published a number of scholarly books. GCI has supported field projects around the world to preserve cultural heritage.\n\nGCI scientists study the deterioration of objects and buildings, and how to prevent or stop such deterioration. One of many projects in this area involved the effect of outdoor and indoor air pollutants on museum collections. Another project analyzed the cause of deterioration of the sandstone in the original National Capitol Columns now at the United States National Arboretum.\n\nIn addition, GCI \"conducts scientific research on materials' composition.\" For example, a project on the conservation of photographs has as one of its objectives the creation of an \"Atlas of Analytical Signatures of Photographic Processes\" which will provide \"a precise chemical fingerprint of all the 150 or so ways pictures have been developed.\" As a part of that project, Getty scientists once examined the world's first photograph from nature by Nicéphore Niépce. Using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and other techniques during the 2002-2003 project, they found (for example) that bitumen of Judea was present in the image.\n\nScientists at GCI viewed the CheMin instrument aboard the Curiosity rover, currently exploring the Gale crater on Mars, as a potentially valuable means to examine ancient works of art without damaging them. Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. The CheMin on \"Curiosity\" directs a beam of X-rays at particles as small as 400 µm and reads the radiation scattered back to determine the composition of an object in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version, named the \"X-Duetto\". Fitting into a few briefcase-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum antiques and the Roman ruins of Herculaneum, Italy.\n\nTraining of interested parties around the world is important for the sustainability of GCI's work. For example, GCI collaborated with other organizations to create a course \"to assist museum personnel in safeguarding their collections from the effects of natural and human-made emergencies.\" Also, GCI developed a course on the \"Fundamentals of the Conservation of Photographs\" which is now taught in eastern Europe by the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Bratislava and the Slovak National Library. Besides courses and workshops, GCI has also been involved with long-term education programs, such as establishing a Master's degree program in Archaeological and Ethnographic Conservation in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nGCI's field projects are \"selected based on how they fit the institute's goals of raising public awareness, contributing new, broadly applicable information to the field, and supporting cultural heritage\" and \"must be executed in collaboration with partners… who must be serious about their efforts… so that projects are assured of continuing after the Getty's involvement ceases.\" Among other completed GCI field projects were efforts to preserve the Mogao Caves and Yungang Grottoes in China (announced in 1989); to restore prehistoric rock paintings of Sierra de San Francisco in Baja California Sur (1994); and to protect ancient buildings and archaeological sites in Iraq following the start of the Iraq War (2004).\n\nIt has been stated that \"perhaps the institute's most profound contribution to conservation is the dissemination of information and methods learned in the field.\" Methods of information dissemination include conferences; lectures; books; and online publications, newsletters, video, and audio.\n\nThe following are selected books published by GCI:\n\nHere is a selection of courses by GCI:\n\nSince GCI was established, it has had three directors. Besides the director, the GCI senior staff includes:\nIn 2009, GCI had a $33 million budget, down from $41 million in 2008.\n\nIn addition to the work of the GCI, the J. Paul Getty Trust contributes to the conservation field through the J. Paul Getty Museum conservation departments, the conservation collection located in the library at the Getty Research Institute, and conservation grants provided by the Getty Foundation.\n\n"}

The term was in common use in the United States at the end of the 19th century and the early decades of the 20th century, and is reflected in such popular songs of the era as \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\". It is now considered offensive.\n\n\"High\" is usually considered a reference to a social class system in which skin color (and associated ancestries) is a major factor, placing those of lighter skin (with more European ancestry) at the top and those of darker skin at the bottom. High yellows, while still considered part of the African-American ethnic group, were thought to gain privileges because of their skin and ancestry. \"Yellow\" is in reference to the usually very pale undertone to the skin color of members of this group, due to mixture with Europeans. Another reading of the etymology of the word \"high\" is that it is a slang word for \"very\", often used in Southern English, therefore \"very yellow\" (as opposed to brown).\n\nIn an aspect of colorism, \"high yellow\" was also related to social class distinctions among people of color. In post-Civil War South Carolina, according to one account by historian Edward Ball, \"Members of the colored elite were called 'high yellow' for their shade of skin\", as well as slang terms meaning snobbish. In New Orleans, the term \"high-yellow\" was associated with Creoles of colour \"brahmins\". In his biography of Duke Ellington, a native of Washington, D.C., David Bradbury wrote that Washington's\n\nIn some cases the confusion of color with class came about because some of the lighter-skinned blacks came from families of mixed heritage free before the Civil War, who had begun to accumulate education and property. In addition, some wealthier white planters made an effort to have their \"natural sons\" (the term for children outside of marriage who were produced with enslaved women) educated or trained as apprentices; some passed on property to them. For instance, in 1860, most of the 200 subscription students at Wilberforce College were the mixed-race sons of white planters, who paid for their education.\n\nThese social distinctions made the cosmopolitan Harlem more appealing to many blacks. The Cotton Club of the Prohibition era \"had a segregated, white-only audience policy and a color-conscious, 'high yellow' hiring policy for chorus girls\". It was common for lighter-skinned African Americans to hold \"paper bag parties,\" which admitted only those whose complexion was lighter than that of a brown paper bag.\n\nIn her 1942 \"Glossary of Harlem Slang\", Zora Neale Hurston placed \"high yaller\" at the beginning of the entry for colorscale, which ran:\n\nThe French author Alexandre Dumas, père was the son of a French mulatto general (born in Saint-Domingue but educated by his father in France) and his French wife. He was described as having skin \"with a yellow so high it was almost white\". In a 1929 review, \"Time\" referred to him as a \"High Yellow Fictioneer\".\n\nThe terminology and its cultural aspects were explored in Dael Orlandersmith's play \"Yellowman\", a 2002 Pulitzer Prize Finalist in drama. The play depicts a dark-skinned girl whose own mother \"inadvertently teaches her the pain of rejection and the importance of being accepted by the 'high yellow' boys\". One reviewer described the term as having \"the inherent, unwieldy power to incite black Americans with such intense divisiveness and fervor\" as few others.\n\nThe phrase survives in folk songs such as \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\", which originally referred to Emily West Morgan, a \"mulatto\" indentured servant apocryphally associated with the Battle of San Jacinto. Blind Willie McTell's song \"Lord, Send Me an Angel\" has its protagonist forced to choose among three women, described as \"Atlanta yellow\", \"Macon brown\", and a \"Statesboro blackskin\". Bessie Smith's song \"I've Got What It Takes\", by Clarence Williams, refers to \"a slick high yeller\" boyfriend who \"turned real pale\" when she wouldn't wait for him to get out of jail. Curtis Mayfield's song \"We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue\" makes reference to a \"high yellow girl\". In \"Big Leg Blues\", Mississippi John Hurt sings: \"Some crave high yellow. I like black and brown.\"\n\nOn the 1988 album Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm by Joni Mitchell, the song \"Dancin' Clown\" contains the lyrics \"Down the street comes last word Susie, she's high yellow, looking top nice.\"\n\nOn Ice Cube's album War and Peace Vol 2. released in 2000, the song \"Hello\" contains the lyrics \"I'm looking for a big yellow, in 6-inch stilettos\".\n\nAs recently as 2004, white R&B singer-songwriter Teena Marie released a song titled \"High Yellow Girl\", said to be about her daughter Alia Rose, who is biracial. The related phrase \"high brown\" was used in Irving Berlin's original lyrics for \"Puttin' on the Ritz\".\n\n"}
{"id": "56606679", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56606679", "title": "Housing insecurity in the United States", "text": "Housing insecurity in the United States\n\nHousing insecurity is the lack of security in an individual shelter that is the result of high housing costs relative to income, poor housing quality, unstable neighborhoods, overcrowding, and/or homelessness.\n\nHousing insecurity has been defined in a variety of ways. These methods have included income-based measures to other descriptive thresholds. Here are a few often cited definitions for housing insecurity.\n\nResearchers from the University of Southern California propose an all encompassing measure of housing insecurity that covers a variety of characteristics, including housing instability, housing affordability, housing safety, housing quality, neighborhood safety, neighborhood quality, and homelessness. They define housing instability as households living in overcrowded conditions as per the PSID. Each household head is allocated two rooms, and each additional married couple or single is allocated one room. Finally, one room is allocated for every two children and one bathroom for every four people.\n\nHousing affordability is defined as the ratio of annualized housing costs to annual income. Different income based measures use different thresholds; however most organizations use either the 30% or 50% threshold, meaning that an individual is housing insecure if they spend more than 30% or 50% of their annual income on housing. Housing safety is defined as a housing issue that presents an imminent health threat, such as inadequate heating capacity, faulty foundation, evidence of rodents, exposed electrical and more. Housing quality is defined as housing that is substandard but does not pose an imminent health risk, such as no cooking unit, no hot/cold water, no drinking water, faulty sewage, and more.\n\nNeighborhood safety is defined as living in a neighborhood that presents imminent health threats, such as a factory is located within half a block, unit is in a flood plain, unsatisfactory police presence, and more. Neighborhood quality is defined as households in neighborhoods with undesirable characteristics that do not pose an imminent health risk, such as poor city/county services, unit is boarded up, roads need repairs, no stores within fifteen minutes, and more. Homelessness in the United States is defined as \"households who define housing type at the time of interviews as either tent, cave, railroad car, unspecified housing unit, a boat, an RV, or an unoccupied site for a mobile home, trailer or tent.\" If an individual meets one of the above criteria, then they are considered housing insecure under this definition. \n\nThe United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, of which the United States is a signee, includes the right to adequate housing. They define adequate housing as having security of tenure, availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, accessibility, location, and cultural adequacy. Many of these tenants are similar to the ones above, such as availability of services (neighborhood quality), affordability, habitability (housing quality and housing safety), and location (neighborhood safety and neighborhood quality).\n\nThis definition does introduce some new factors, which are security of tenure, accessibility, and cultural adequacy. The UN defines security of tenure as having tenure security which guarantees legal protection against forced evictions, harassment, and other threats. They define accessibility as taking into account the specific needs of disadvantaged and marginalized groups. They define cultural adequacy as respecting and taking into account the expression of cultural identity. If housing does not meet any of these criteria, it is considerate inadequate, or housing insecure. \n\nVarious federal agencies have put forth different definitions of housing insecurity at different times. First, in studying the health effects of housing insecurity, the National Institute of Health has defined housing insecurity as high housing costs in proportion to income, poor housing quality, unstable neighborhoods, overcrowding, or homelessness. All of these factors are similar to those defined above. The Center for Disease Control has used their own definition of housing insecurity to study disease prevention. They studied housing insecurity through a survey question that asks, \"How often in the past 12 months would you say you were worried or stressed about having enough money to pay your rent/mortgage? Sometimes, Usually, or always?\" The Department of Housing and Urban Development distributes the American Housing Survey that deems that housing units which are affected by any of the descriptors below are considered to be extremely inadequate. \n\nThis list includes, \"unit does not have hot and cold running water\", \"unit does not have a bathtub or shower\", \"unit does not have a flush toilet\", \"unit shares plumbing facilities\", \"unit was cold for 24 hours or more and more than two breakdowns of the heating equipment have occurred that lasted longer than 6 hours', \"electricity is not used\", and the \"unit has exposed wiring, not every room has working electrical plugs, and the fuses have blown more than twice.\" Furthermore, HUD considers housing inadequate if the unit has five or six of the following structural conditions: \"unit has had outside water leaks in the past 12 months', \"unit has had inside water leaks in the past 12 months', \"unit has holes in the floor', \"unit has open cracks wider than a dime', \"unit has an area of peeling paint larger than 8 by 11 inches', and \"rats have been seen recently in the unit.\" \n\nThere have been calls for one unified national definition for housing insecurity, much like there is a definition of food insecurity. Researchers argue that it is difficult to study the effect of housing insecurity because it has been defined in so many different ways. A unified definition of housing insecurity will also help standardize the research on housing insecurity. Furthermore, a working definition for housing insecurity across the federal government could allow individuals who qualify for assistance to know that they qualify.\n\nThe various forms of housing insecurity have been studied in order to find which life circumstances lead families to housing insecurity. Associations between unreliable housing and factors such as race, income, and family type are especially clear. Housing insecure households are likely to consist of unmarried people. 57% of housing insecure households are made up of unmarried individuals that do not have children.\n\nThe second largest category is unmarried households with children, which makes up 21% of the distribution. 63% of housing insecure households are extremely low income, which means their annual income is less than the Federal Poverty Level or 30% of the Area Median Income. Most people facing housing insecurity are not seniors and are renters. A lack of education has an especially evident association with housing insecurity. Within housing insecure households, 18% of individuals have a bachelor's or graduate degree, while 50% have no college experience. 55% of housing insecure households are white.\n\nRates of housing insecurity are fairly consistent across the United States. For the majority of states, between 10% and 15% of households are housing insecure. Wyoming has the least housing insecurity while California and New York have the most housing insecurity; 20% of households face housing insecurity.\n\nIn regards to rates of housing inadequacy defined by the American Housing Survey, the number of housing units that were considered extremely inadequate fluctuated between 2005 and 2009.There were 2,021,050 extremely inadequate units that were occupied in 2005, 1,805,960 extremely inadequate units that were occupied in 2007, and 1,863,660 extremely inadequate units that were occupied in 2009. The average number of extremely inadequate units for these three years, 1,896,890 units, amounts to less than 2% of the total number of housing units in the United States. The characteristics that most frequently made units deemed extremely inadequate were shared plumbing facilities (55%) and unacceptably long cold periods (29%). 91.6% of extremely inadequate units experienced only one of the listed qualities of an extremely inadequate unit.\nWithin the last decade, researchers have found negative factors associated with housing insecurity in America. It is important to note that among these studies, many of which are cross-sectional analyses, researchers acknowledge that it is not currently possible to pinpoint the exact causes and effects. The absence of a valid measure or universal definition for housing insecurity may be a possible reason for lack of research. Despite these implications with research, findings across the board suggest housing insecurity is a negative risk factor when it pertains to health and educational attainment.\n\nIn a study that analyzed data from the 2011 Washington State Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System, 29.4% of the 8,416 respondents reported being housing insecure. Housing insecure respondents were approximately \"twice as likely to report poor or fair health status\" compared to those who did not report being housing insecure. Approximately one third of the housing insecure respondents reported delaying doctor visits due to the costs. 26.9% of the housing insecure respondents were current smokers and \"26.3% had poor or fair health\". \n\nAnother cross-sectional analysis focusing on children from low-income households reports similar findings about the association between housing instability and medical care. The study which looks at 12,746 subjects from 2002 National Survey of America's Families data reports that \"housing instability was independently associated with postponed medical care, postponed medications, and increased emergency department visits\". Researchers note that a possible explanation for these associations may be due to \"financial strain\" and the need to prioritize other needs such as housing and food. Other health outcomes that have been associated with housing insecurity by past studies include: probable GAD, depression, and PTSD.\n\nEvidence suggests there is link between housing insecurity and performance in school. A longitudinal study assessing the academic achievements of children in Minneapolis Public Schools reported that homeless and highly mobile children were \"at greater risk for low academic achievement relative to other low-income students as well as more advantaged students.\" It is unclear if being homeless or highly mobile are short-term or long-term risks due to few longitudinal studies and limited access to the needed data. \n\nSome scholars conclude the aforementioned achievement gaps with homeless and highly mobile students tend to be chronic and \"may worsen among older grade cohorts.\" Highly mobile students were also linked with having \"increased rates of grade retention\" and more \"school-related problems such as expulsion or suspension\", compared to other students. \n\nOne source of assistance is locally located public housing agencies (PHAs) that distribute section 8 vouchers. The vouchers are funded by the U.S. government, specifically the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. These vouchers help low income families or individuals pay for their rent. The PHA determines eligibility based on income, family size and citizenship. Most families that qualify are put on a waitlist, and once they get a voucher, they must be able to find their own housing, and it must meet the safety requirements of the PHA. Once the family meets all the standards, the PHA may partially pay the landlord for the family's rent, requiring the family to pay the difference, or depending on the situation, the PHA may pay for a reasonably priced home.\n\nThe National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC) aims to create housing stability in the U.S. by increasing affordable housing and supporting government funded homes. The organization consists of 5 teams: the Research Team, the Policy Team, the Field Team, the Communications Team, and the Administration Team. The Research Team looks at statistics of housing insecurity, and the Policy Team helps inform policy makers about these trends. The Field Team raises awareness and the Communications Team gathers input from the general population about their views of housing insecurity. Finally, the Administration Team oversees the organization and regulates progress. These 5 groups all come together to combat housing insecurity.\n\nEnterprise is another organization that has a plan to end housing insecurity by 2020. Their goal is not only to provide for low income families, but to also improve their psychological and physical well being. They have 5 pillars that they focus on: homes, systems, connections, resources, and foundation. Their objective is to provide affordable housing with systems that will provide equal opportunity for low income families. Enterprise also looks for opportunities to expand resources in the government to help those in need. Enterprise's 5 pillars come together to shape their main goal of becoming the foundation that will be strong enough to end housing insecurity.\n\n"}

It has branches in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.\n\nThe IFPO was created in 2003 by bringing together three existing French Institutes in the area : IFEAD (French Institute for Arab Studies in Damascus, established in 1922), IFAPO (French Institute of near Eastern Archaeology established in Syria and Lebanon in 1946) and CERMOC (Centre for Study and Research on the Contemporary Middle East, est. 1977 in Lebanon and 1988 in Jordan). The IFPO has the status of a \"Joint Entity of French Research Institutes Abroad\" (UMIFRE no6, Unité Mixte des Instituts français de recherche à l’étranger) and is under the aegis of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the CNRS (National Centre for Scientific Research).\n\nIFPO is active in Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, and hopes to be able to extend its activities to Iraq and the Palestinian Territories. Its Director-General, who is based in Damascus, is Eberhard Kienle, who was preceded by François Burgat (2008-2013), Jean-Yves L’Hôpital (June 2005-May 2008) and Christian Décobert (Jan. 2003-Aug. 2004). The Institute’s tasks are research, research training, the diffusion of knowledge and cooperation with local and international institutions. These tasks are carried out with the support of the local Ministries in charge of Research and Higher Education, and in close cooperation with both. \nThe Institute acts as a centre for study and research in all fields relating to the ancient and modern civilizations of the Near East. On the basis of the numerous activities and publications of its researchers, the institute aims at raising the French contribution to research to the highest academic standards in the various fields of research related to these civilizations, from the earliest times to the contemporary period. The Institute also trains young researchers for careers in teaching and research.\n\nThe Institute is organised into three scientific departments : Archeology and Ancient History (Director Frédéric Alpi) ; Arab, Medieval and Modern Studies (director : Bruno Lory) ; Contemporary Studies (director : Myriam Catusse). \nIn its different locations, the Institute recruits experienced researchers (at various levels in their careers) from France, from the three countries in which it is established, from Europe and from the rest of the world. They come for a maximum of four years and are selected to take part in the various academic projects initiated by the Institute. It also welcomes receives young researchers (PHD candidates, grant holders, etc.) of all nationalities to take part in its activities. The duration of their stay varies according to their individual situation.\nThe Institute also awards some short-term grants for limited projects. Since many of these researchers also belong to other research teams or programmes in France and elsewhere, the Institute hopes that these projects will strengthen and broaden its academic network.\n\n"}
{"id": "17169853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17169853", "title": "Inventory (museum)", "text": "Inventory (museum)\n\nAn inventory is an itemized list of objects that the museum has accessioned or received via loan(s) and must be physically located by an examiner. A complete, one-hundred percent inventory, or a random inventory of the collection must be carried out periodically to ensure the museum is operating under best practices and for security purposes. The museum is legally responsible and ethically obligated for the maintenance of up-to-date information detailing the location of all objects within the collection, including loaned items and objects that have yet to be accessioned; this is stipulated by many museum associations, including the American Association of Museums.\n\nAlthough inventories require a large amount of work and are not part of the more glitzy side of museum work, their value is nonetheless extremely important. The upkeep of the collections’ inventory record is needed for minimum collections accountability. Inventories provide the collections manager and or the registrar with information for insurance purposes, security, and alerts staff to possible conservation or preservation needs of the collection.\n\nThe completion and upkeep of and an inventory system helps to deter and aid in the early detection of theft of the collection. The International Council of Museums (ICOM) urges museums to complete and maintain their inventory systems because \"If a museum does not know what is in its collection, where the works are located, and the condition they are in, it, in effect, invites theft because it will have no immediate sense that an object has disappeared, and most important, it will have no descriptive information to aid the recovery of an object in the event of a theft.\" \n<br>\n\nThe type of inventory system used by a museum will be dictated by the Collections Management Policy (CMP). The CMP will determine how often items, what items, and how many items are to be inventory. Museums need to periodically complete a one-hundred percent inventory of their collection, but for the period in between the completion of such an inventory, a random sampling of the collection is sufficient. A random sampling of the collection serves as an indicator for the rest of the collection. If all the items are accounted for in a random sampling, then it can be assumed that rest of the collections’ records is just as reliable. However, a complete inventory provides the institution with the knowledge that the entire collection can be accounted for; the random sampling is used to check the consistency of the collections’ records.\n\nAn ongoing inventory method is a system that inventories on a regular basis high value items or items that are more susceptible to theft. This method resembles an iceberg, with the high value items being at the top of the iceberg. As the inventory method progresses further down the iceberg, items of lesser value can be found. Items found toward the center of the iceberg, need to be inventoried less than those found higher up on the berg, and more than items found below its position. Items at the lowest position of the iceberg, below the water’s surface, may only need to be inventoried annually. With this type of inventory system, the most important or most valued objects are accounted for on a regular basis.\n\nInventories serve several purposes, including the opportunity for review of the collections department. Such review includes: \nAn inventory provides a systematic review of the collections department’s records and helps to identify any problems. How smoothly an inventory goes is actually a reflection upon the institution. If an inventory is completed with little or no issues, then the collections department is running well; however, if many issues arise during the inventory process, this may be indicative of a collections department in need of review and change.\n\nEvery museum must complete an inventory on a regular basis and this requirement should be stated in the museum’s CMP. The CMP should also outline the steps that need to be carried out in the inventory process, including: \n\nSufficient time spent in planning must be devoted before beginning such a task as an inventory. A well thought out inventory procedure will efficiently utilize staff and their time. Such procedure should include:\n\nNow that inventory policy and procedure have been established, it is time to carry out the inventory. Conducting an inventory is the final step to the inventory process, it is relatively simple in that the actions are repetitive, but it can be one of the most time consuming parts of the inventory process depending upon the size of the collection and the intended scope of the inventory. \n<br>\n\nSelect a method of approach when beginning the inventory process. How will the collection be inventoried? Shelf by shelf; or in numerical order of the catalogue? Once the inventory method is decided, a uniformed and basic inventory record for each object needs to be created. Such a record might contain the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was later delayed to 2006, then to 2007/2008, then to 2010/2011, then to 2012, then to 2013, then to 2015, followed by 2015/2016. Currently the KEO website cites 2019 as its launch, however, no actual date is set and information about its launch is vague.\n\nIts name represents the three most frequently used sounds common to the most widely spoken languages today, , , and .\n\nEvery person is invited to contribute to the time capsule. The contribution deadline was originally 31 December 2009, but , it has been extended to end of 2014. Messages can be posted via the project's website or sent by postal mail. The organizers encourage everybody to gather messages from children, senior citizens, and the illiterate so that every culture and demographic on Earth is represented. The organization says, \"All the messages received, without undergoing any censorship, will be embarked aboard KEO.\" The satellite has enough capacity to carry a four-page message from each of the more than six billion (as of the original 2009 deadline) inhabitants on the planet. Once the satellite is launched, the messages will be made freely available on the web.\n\nKEO will also carry a diamond that encases a drop of human blood chosen at random and samples of air, sea water, and earth. The DNA of the human genome will be engraved on one of the diamond's facets. The satellite will also carry an astronomical clock that shows the current rotation rates of several pulsars, photographs of people of all cultures, and \"the contemporary Library of Alexandria\", an encyclopaedic compendium of current human knowledge.\n\nThe messages and library will be encoded in glass-made radiation-resistant DVDs. Symbolic instructions in several formats will show the future finders how to build a DVD reader.\n\nThe satellite itself is a hollow sphere 80 cm in diameter. The sphere is engraved with a map of Earth and surrounded by an aluminium layer, a thermal layer and several layers of titanium and other heavy materials intertwined with vacuum. The sphere is resistant to cosmic radiation, atmosphere re-entry, space junk impacts, etc. For its first few years in orbit, KEO will sport a pair of wings 10 meters across that will aid in its spotting from Earth. As the satellite enters the atmosphere, the thermal layer will produce an artificial aurora to give a signal of the satellite's re-entry. The passive satellite will not carry any communications or propulsion systems. It will be launched by an Ariane 5 rocket into an orbit 1,800 km high, an altitude that will bring it back to Earth in 500 centuries, the same amount of time that has elapsed since early humans started to draw on cavern walls.\n\nThe project KEO was conceived in 1994 by French artist-scientist Jean-Marc Philippe, a pioneer of space art. Messages began to be collected, and an initial launch date was set for 2001. Technical feasibility demonstration and other various delays have moved the launch date to 2015.\n\nSeveral previous spacecraft have included time capsules for humans (or aliens) in the far future. Part of the Apollo 11 Lunar Module, still on the moon, includes a plaque showing the arrangement of the Earth's continents in 1969.

They may be of many sizes, but are most often found in sizes similar to large handbags. Kete are traditionally woven from the leaves of New Zealand flax (\"Phormium tenax\", known in Māori as \"harakeke\"), with two handles at the top. Other materials are sometimes used, including the leaves of the nikau palm and cabbage tree.\n\nIn pre-European society, Māori had specific plantations of flax, which was their most important textile. It was prepared by cutting the green leaves close to the base before the leaves were split and woven. Various preparations of the leaves allowed the material to be used both as a hardy flat thick-woven material (as in kete and mats) and also as a fibrous twine, used for creating both rope and finely woven cloaks.\n\n\n"}

Such objects are sometimes appreciated in a knowingly ironic or humorous way. The word was first applied to artwork that was a response to certain divisions of 19th-century art with aesthetics that favored what later art critics would consider to be exaggerated sentimentality and melodrama. Hence, 'kitsch art' is closely associated with 'sentimental art'. Kitsch is also related to the concept of camp, because of its humorous and ironic nature.\n\nTo brand visual art as \"kitsch\" is generally pejorative, as it implies that the work in question is gaudy, or that it serves a solely ornamental and decorative purpose rather than amounting to a work of true artistic merit. The term is also sometimes applied to music or literature.\n\nAs a descriptive term, \"kitsch\" originated in the art markets of Munich in the 1860s and the 1870s, describing cheap, popular, and marketable pictures and sketches. In \"Das Buch vom Kitsch\" (\"The Book of Kitsch\"), Hans Reimann defines it as a professional expression \"born in a painter's studio\".\n\nThe study of kitsch was done almost exclusively in German until the 1970s, with Walter Benjamin being an important scholar in the field.\n\nModernist writer Hermann Broch argues that the essence of kitsch is imitation: kitsch mimics its immediate predecessor with no regard to ethics—it aims to copy the beautiful, not the good. According to Walter Benjamin, kitsch is, unlike art, a utilitarian object lacking all critical distance between object and observer; it \"offers instantaneous emotional gratification without intellectual effort, without the requirement of distance, without sublimation\".\n\nKitsch is less about the thing observed than about the observer. According to Roger Scruton, \"Kitsch is fake art, expressing fake emotions, whose purpose is to deceive the consumer into thinking he feels something deep and serious.\"\n\nTomáš Kulka in \"Kitsch and Art\" starts from two basic facts that kitsch \"has an undeniable mass-appeal\" and \"considered (by the art-educated elite) bad\" and then proposes three essential conditions: \n\nThe Kitsch movement is an international movement of classical painters, founded in 1998 upon a philosophy proposed by Odd Nerdrum and later clarified in his book \"On Kitsch\" in cooperation with Jan-Ove Tuv and others, incorporating the techniques of the Old Masters with narrative, romanticism, and emotionally charged imagery.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2501143", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2501143", "title": "Madea", "text": "Madea\n\nMabel \"Madea\" Simmons is a character created and portrayed by Tyler Perry. The character is a tough elderly black woman.\n\nVindictive in nature, Madea gets even in a bad way. When asked why she felt the need to get somebody all the time, Madea answered: \"Well when you gettin' got and somebody done got you and you go get them, when you get 'em, everybody's gon' get got.\" Additionally, Madea has a tendency to overreact and is willing to threaten to use deadly weapons, destroy property, use physical violence, take on the law, and use any and all means necessary to show up an offending party. Incorrigible in her overreactive ways, Madea has repeatedly landed herself in court (usually before Judge Mablean), anger management classes, house arrest, and even prison.\n\nDespite her questionable methods, she stands for what's right and has a nurturing side. As examples, Madea is often seen officiously involving herself in circumstances in which others have been wronged, offering self-defense tips, instruction, or avenging them on her own; by her very nature, Madea is more than willing to \"thug out\" on some of the sassiest and brattiest of children and teens, but also shows to care about their well-being in the end. The character combines an unusual pronunciation style with her locutions, such as \"Heller, how ya dern?\" or \"Halleluyer praise da lort!\"\n\nMadea is based on Perry's mother and his aunt, as well Eddie Murphy's performance in \"\". In Perry's own words Madea is \". . .exactly the PG version of my mother and my aunt, and I loved having an opportunity to pay homage to them. She would beat the hell out of you but make sure the ambulance got there in time to make sure they could set your arm back. . .\"\n\nMabel \"Madea\" Simmons was born in Greensburg, Louisiana, on June 26, 1931. (Madea was 68 in the first play, \"I Can Do Bad All by Myself\", as well as \"Madea's Class Reunion\". Her ages in the other plays are unknown because they take place between these two plays, and there's no continuity offered. In \"Madea Goes to Jail\", Madea was around 75). In \"I Can Do Bad All by Myself,\" she reveals she once lived in Cleveland, Ohio, but later returned to Atlanta.\n\nMadea was brought up in poverty and grew up living in shacks with her immediate family. Madea has stated that although her family didn't have much, they had love.\n\nAccording to \"Family Reunion\", Madea's mother, \"Big Mabel\" Murphy, was a hooker during Madea's childhood and wasn't at all religious. As a result, Madea grew up with little knowledge of Christianity (as an elderly woman, Madea has a tendency to misquote the Bible).\n\nShe attended Booker T. Washington High School, where she served as a cheerleader. When Madea was 16, her parents moved her and the rest of her immediate family to Atlanta, Georgia, in a shotgun house. It was reported in Madea's book, \"Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings\", that Madea's mother and father wouldn't allow her to go out at all until she turned 17 or 18.\n\nIn the films, it has been revealed that Madea used to be a stripper, and her stagenames were Magnitude and Delicious. It is heavily implied that she was a prostitute as well.\n\nMadea has a lifelong criminal record that began at age 9 with a charge of petty theft. It is also reported that Madea was charged with her first felony at this age, and her crimes began progressing to illegal gambling at age 18, which later evolved into check fraud, identity theft, insurance fraud (presumably related to her nine deceased husbands), assault, attempted murder, vehicle theft (mostly Lexus vehicles, the first vehicle she ever stole being a 1992 Lexus LS400), reckless driving (including smashing through objects, notably a mansion gate, a Cadillac CTS, and a fast food window in \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\", \"Goes to Jail\", and \"Big Happy Family\" respectively) and forklifting vehicles out of parking spaces (usually for taking spaces that she wants to park at, as she did to many Camrys and Scions, as well as a Pontiac Solstice that she ruined in \"Madea Goes to Jail\"). Throughout the series, she is a repeat offender.\n\nIn \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" alone, Madea and her granddaughter Helen McCarter were both charged with \"criminal trespassing, reckless endangerment, criminal possession of a handgun, assault with a deadly weapon, [driving on a] suspended license, expired registration, reckless driving, and a broken taillight\", which placed Madea on house arrest, while her granddaughter was bailed for $5,000.\n\nIn \"Family Reunion\", she violated the terms of house arrest by taking off her house arrest bracelet but was given the opportunity to avoid jail by becoming a foster mother.\n\nIn \"Meet the Browns\", Madea was stopped by police as a normal traffic stop, only to refuse to pull over (fearing that she'll be sent to jail again), which leads her into a high-speed car chase with several law enforcement officials and news helicopters.\n\nIn \"Goes to Jail\", Madea was about to get sent to jail, but was reluctantly released by Judge Mablean after learning the arresting officers did not read the Miranda rights warning when she was arrested (as the officers claimed that Madea was fighting with them), so she finally admits that her license was suspended indefinitely (implying that her license was suspended when she was 30 years old) and also gets ordered to anger management counseling, making it the very last opportunity for her to avoid jail. She, however, began driving as soon as Cora neglected her daughterly duties. Madea's brother Joe (also played by Perry) refers to her as a \"po-po ho\", meaning someone who is a professional at evading law enforcement.\n\nIn \"A Madea Christmas\", Madea confides in her niece Eileen that she sold \"trees\"; when Eileen asks if they were Christmas trees, Madea replies that \"when you smoke 'em, they make you feel like it's Christmas\", implying that she once was a marijuana dealer.\n\nScurrilous, wise cracking, and saucy in remarks and behavior, Madea is full of comical sass and vulgar and abusive language. She also has many catch phrases, such as \"You crazy as hell,\" and \"I oughta punch you in da face!\" In addition, she uses Ebonics and other various urban expressions. Madea also intentionally adds a mispronounced \"t\" sound to many of her words, such as \"Africant Americant\", \"cooking and cleanting\" and \"living for da Lort [Lord].\"\n\nMadea is mostly noted for her outrageous overreactions and thuggish toughness over which she has shown no shame. For example, the character has four general methods of attack:\n\nWhen using guns, Madea shoots around targets, using intimidation rather than actually killing or injuring anyone. As another form of intimidation, Madea frequently boasts of having killed in the past. As an example, she once claimed to have murdered Jimmy Hoffa over him insulting her. She also claimed to have shot Tupac Shakur while arguing over a parking space; although she claims not to have killed him in the shooting.\n\nIn spite of her outrageous and shocking behaviors, Madea is consultative, protective, loving, and motherly at heart. This is heavily evidenced in \"Gets a Job\", in which Madea provides life lessons, guidance, and direction to all the residents and staff members of a nursing home. Moreover, on numerous occasions, Madea has accepted family members who were without a place to stay into her home on her own accord. These family members have included her granddaughter Helen (\"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\" film), granddaughter Vianne (\"I Can Do Bad All by Myself\"), her great niece Vanessa and her two kids (\"Madea's Family Reunion\"), and ex-convict Bobby Mitchell (\"I Can Do Bad All by Myself\").\n\nQuite often, Madea has offered direction and guidance to those who were being abused within their romantic relationships. Though much of this direction and guidance tends to come in the form of extreme warmongering, Madea's heart is always in the right place.\n\nMadea also instructs troubled individuals about the mistakes they've made in their life choices and leads them down the path of forgiveness and improvement. While in prison in the film \"Madea Goes to Jail\", Madea attends an anger management church meeting under duress. During the meeting, Madea ends up lecturing all the women to stop playing victims, stop whining, and start taking action to improve their lives.\n\nMadea is mentally strong and offers nurturing advice to struggling individuals whom she cares for.\n\nMadea has a series of pet peeves: disrespectful youth, gum popping, rude people; lazy people; people who don't return shopping carts; adulterous people; and \"people who are just plain stupid.\" She is also a firm critic of men that sag their pants, believing that it looks cheap and sloppy.\n\nIn the book \"Tyler Perry's Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings\", Madea gives details on her mother, \"Big Mable\" Murphy, who was described as \"unusually large\". \"Big Mable\" is characterized as being very gentle, mild-mannered, kind and peaceful woman, with a long and very dangerous fuse. In \"Madea's Family Reunion\", Madea revealed that \"Big Mabel\" was a hooker during Madea's childhood and not at all religious.\n\nMadea's brothersAccording to \"Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings\", Madea has several brothers. Three of them are Frederick (revealed in the book), Joe, and Heathrow (revealed in \"Madea's Family Funeral\").\n\nMadea's sisterIn \"Madea's Family Reunion\", it was revealed that Madea has an older sister named Irene Andrews, who has a son named Sonny and a daughter named Victoria. The film begins with everyone leaving Irene's funeral. Madea was shown as not caring much for her sister; in fact, not only does Madea claim she's happy Irene's died, but she has also said Irene probably died on purpose to get out of repaying Madea a $20 loan. In \"Madea Goes to Jail\", Madea helps out Sonny by letting him stay at her home rent-free.\n\nIn \"Madea Goes to Jail\", it was revealed that Madea supported her children by stripping, pole dancing, and professional wrestling, among other things.\n\nMadea has buried nine husbands, among them Jimmy and Johnny. Madea claims to have shot some of them and poisoned others of them with her sweet potato pie. After each husband died, they were buried quickly and Madea collected their life insurance checks. Each time it's happened, Madea has stated \"I'm tryin' to get to the insurance company by five, and the casino by nine!\"\n\nFirst husband: Johnny SimmonsMadea killed her first husband Johnny Simmons (deceased), the father of Michelle and William. Madea implies that she was glad when he died and that their marriage wasn't good. Johnny's niece Vickie appears in \"Family Reunion\"; she is the mother of four sons.\nDaughter: Cora SimmonsMadea's daughter, Cora Simmons, is her most recognized and only child to appear in most of the plays and movies. Cora is 50 in \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\". She was born in 1953 when Madea was 18. Cora is a devout Christian and is often in the company of her father Leroy Brown.\n\nTina and Lisa only appear in \"Family Reunion\", but are the only granddaughters to be mentioned all the time.\n\nCora thought that Johnny was her father until \"Class Reunion\", in which Madea reminded Cora that she [Cora] was the product of a one-night stand with Leroy Brown during their prom in 1953. This suggests that Madea is 62 years old in her first appearance, as well as in \"Madea's Class Reunion\" when her parents attend their 50th class reunion. Once Cora learned the truth, she became closer to Mr. Brown, visiting his family (in \"Meet the Browns\") and taking him to the hospital in \"What's Done in the Dark\". Their father/daughter plotline is shown on movies in \"Meet the Browns\", the TV series \"Tyler Perry's House of Payne\", and its spin-off series \"Meet the Browns\". In the movie, \"Madea's Big Happy Family\", Cora enlists the help of Maury Povich to find out if Leroy Brown is in fact her father, after a blood test proves he is not. DNA tests reveal that Leroy Brown is not the father of Cora.\n\nIn \"Madea's Big Happy Family\" there is no apparent relation between Leroy Brown and Cora other than friends.\n\nSon: William SimmonsWilliam is Madea's youngest and only son. Depending on the chronological order of the plays, William could be older than Cora. William is married to Myrtle. As far as the plays, Myrtle only appears in the \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\". She is, however, mentioned in the \"I Can Do Bad All by Myself\" play. In the plays, Myrtle is in her 50s. In the film timeline, Myrtle is in her 70s, and is placed in a retirement home. This shows a natural propensity to disregard timelines humorously, because Madea herself is only in her mid-seventies.\n\nWilliam and Myrtle have three children: Helen, Jackie, and Gina, all of whom have either appeared or been mentioned in one of the plays (though only Helen is mentioned in the movie). William's oldest daughter, Helen, is in her mid to late 30s in \"Diary of a Mad Black Woman\", which makes William in his 50s.\n\nTyler Perry has confirmed that in \"A Madea Family Funeral\" (2018) Madea has another brother named Heathrow (also played by Perry), a Vietnam war veteran.\n\nMadea has appeared in several plays (some of which have been recorded for repeated viewing), fully produced films, a couple of television programs (guest appearances), one book and one animated film. The character made her first appearance in the 1999 play \"I Can Do Bad All by Myself\", later appearing in numerous other plays by Perry, then appearing in films based on those plays.\n\n\n\n\nIn the TBS comedy-drama \"House of Payne\" pilot episode \"Bully and the Beast\", Madea was the foster mother of Nikki. She factored into the plot through a school altercation between her adopted daughter and Curtis Payne's (the series' protagonist) great-nephew Malik. Curtis takes a particular disliking to Madea, who is not in the least bit intimidated by Curtis at all. Rather conversely, Curtis became intimidated by Madea and had nightmares about her.\n\nIn the episode \"The Wench Who Saved Christmas\", Curtis tries to discourage everyone from having the Christmas spirit. He later fell asleep and dreamt that Madea was the ghost of Christmas past, present, and future. In this form, she tried to teach him a lesson about his killjoy behavior.\n\nIn the episode \"Wife Swap\", Curtis' wife Ella chastises him for taking her for granted. That night, Curtis has an extended nightmare where he is married to Madea instead of Ella.\n\nOn another TBS series, \"Meet the Browns\", Madea is said to be the mother of Cora Simmons as a result of a one-night stand with the show's lead character, She is an unseen character throughout the series.\n\nOn January 21, 2015, Madea made a special guest appearance in the Oprah Winfrey Network comedy series, \"Love Thy Neighbor\". The episode titled \"Madea's Pressure Is Up\" aired as part of the 3rd season of \"Love Thy Neighbor.\"\n\n\"Don't Make a Black Woman Take Off Her Earrings\": Perry wrote the book in the character's persona. The book was published on April 11, 2006.\n\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" put the character on its end-of-the-decade, \"best-of\" list, saying, \"Whether she's going to jail or just opening up a can of whupass, Tyler Perry's Madea is the profane, gun-toting granny you never had but (maybe) wish you did.\"\n\n\nOn April 1, 2013, Orlando Jones pulled an April Fools' Day prank, informing the public via his \"Huffington Post\" account that he would be replacing Perry as Madea. Jones led the public to believe that the decision had come amid Perry's prior obligations, assisting Oprah Winfrey with her struggling OWN network. As part of the prank, Jones released a photo of himself to the public in which he was impersonating Madea. In addition, he incorporated several pretend quotes seemingly issued by Perry, both acknowledging the news and giving Jones his blessing to continue on with the character. Unaware of the prank, however, many fans responded with great outrage and criticism. As result of increasing outcries from fans, Perry informed the public on April 15, 2013, that the news was untrue. Perry was quoted as stating, \"That was an April Fool's joke that \"HE\" did. Not true. And not funny. When I'm done with Madea, she is done.\"\n\nPerry has been accused of minstrelsy and playing into black stereotypes with the Madea character, most notably by fellow black director Spike Lee. Perry's argument with Lee dates back to a 2009 interview in which Lee referred to Perry's films as \"coonery buffoonery\". Lee equated the Madea movies with the old-time minstrel shows which lampooned black people as dim-witted, lazy, buffoonish, superstitious and happy-go-lucky, and further stated that if a white director made a movie depicting black people in such a manner he would be ostracized.\n\nPerry responded by stating that his films were meant as entertainment and should not be taken so seriously. Stated Perry, \"I am sick of him talking about me. I am sick of him saying, 'This is a coon, this is a buffoon.' I am sick of him talking about black people going to see movies. This is what he said: 'You vote by what you see'—as if black people don't know what they want to see. I am sick of him. He talked about Whoopi, he talked about Oprah, he talked about me, he talked about Clint Eastwood. Spike needs to shut the hell up!\"\n\n"}

{"id": "38862518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38862518", "title": "Mediated quasi-interaction", "text": "Mediated quasi-interaction\n\nMediated quasi-interaction is a concept in communication science that describes a monological interaction between people, which is oriented towards an indefinite range of potential recipients. It involves a fundamental asymmetry between producers and receivers. Some examples of Mediated Quasi-Interaction are television, radio and newspapers and other forms of mass media.\n\nThe concept was developed by sociologist John Brookshire Thompson, a professor at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of Jesus College. The concept is first documented in his book “The Rise of Mediated Interaction”, which was published in 1995 in Cambridge, UK. Thompson developed a conceptual framework for the analysis of the forms of action and interaction created by the media. He wanted to focus the types of interactional situation created by the mass media. He also wanted the analytical framework to examine some of the interactional features of the social relationships established by the media.\n\nHe created the concept in part of his theory of interaction. The 3 steps theory consisted of Face-to-Face interaction, Mediated Interaction and Mediated Quasi-Interaction. Face-to- people share time and space, since they are co-present and mediated interaction the sending of the message and its reception are separated in time and space.\nThompson, 1995, Table 3.1\n\nMediated Quasi-interaction is monologicial in character and involves the production of symbolic forms for an indefinite range of potential recipients. Mediated Quasi-Interaction creates a certain kind of social situation in which individuals are linked together in a process of communication and symbolic exchange. It is a structured situation in which some individuals are engaged primarily in producing symbolic forms for others who are not physically present, while others are involved primarily in receiving symbolic forms produced to whom they cannot respond, but with whom they can form bonds of friendship, affection or loyalty.\n\nMediated quasi-interaction is based on social relations established by media of mass communications. With mass media being impossible to be genuine interactivity, Mediated quasi-interaction is simulated interaction. It is typical for the mass media to try to simulate interpersonal communication and to personalize their communication (ex. Call-ins). Another focus of Mediated Quasi-Interaction is also on its space-time constitution. It is described as a separation of contexts with extended availability in time and space.\n\nMediated Quasi-Interaction can also be combined with other interaction such as face-to-face. For example, people can sit in a room together and have a discussion while they are watching television. In a similar relation, a television program may involve face to face interaction with a panel and an audience, although the program remains primarily a form Mediated Quasi-Interaction.\n\n"}

In 1937 moved to USA, where he taught Irish in the University of Madison (his son John M. Dillon was born in Madison), in 1946-1947 taught in Chicago. On his return to Ireland worked in the School of Celtic Studies in Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies; was the director of the School from 1960 till 1968, edited Celtica. Volume 11 of Celtica is dedicated to his memory. From 1966 to 1967 he was President of the Royal Irish Academy.\n\nMyles Dillon is the author of a number of important scholarly books, handbooks and translations from Old Irish. Among his most notable works are \"The Cycles of the Kings\" (1946), \"Early Irish literature\" (1948), \"The Celtic realms\" (1967, with Nora Kershaw Chadwick). M.

Dehkhoda defines \"Nakhl\" as \"a big, tall bier (coffin) to which are attached daggers, swords, luxurious fabrics, and mirrors.\" \"Nakhls\" are constructed in various sizes, from a simple ones carried by two persons, to huge structures \"supported by hundreds of men\". According to Parviz Tanavoli, an Iranian sculptor, \"Nakhl\" is a \"freestanding\" sculpture.\n\nThe structure is called \"Nakhl\" since it's \"widely\" believed that Husayn ibn Ali's body was moved to the shade of a palm tree, after his death, or because his body was carried using a coffin made of branches of palm tree, \"the only material available in Karbala\" at that time.\n\nAs a \"symbol of social unity for a town, village, or district,\" many \"Nakhls\" and their associated rituals are seen in Yazd Province, located near the Kavir Desert, with every village having its own \"Nakhl\". \"Nakhl\" is often referred to as \"Naql\", i.e. \"to convey carry and transfer,\" in Yazd and neighboring towns and villages. Yazd is described as \"Iran’s museum of mourning tools\" by Jalal Al-e-Ahmad, and is the home to the largest \"Nakhl,\" which needs to be carried by \"several hundred men\". The 8.5 meters high structure, constructed in 1879, stands in Amir Chakhmaq square of Yazd city and is decayed and no longer used because of the safety concerns.\n\n\"Nakh-Gardani\" is the act of carrying \"Nakhl\", sometimes by \"several strong men\", on the Day of Ashura, as if it is Imam Husyan's coffin. The ritual, historically dating back to pre-Safavids (almost 450 years ago), is carried out at various places in Iran. People carrying the \"Nakhl\" on their shoulders are guided by the people standing on the Nakhl.\n\nThe ritual is so common in Iran that in most parts of the country, either people have the \"Nakhl\" in their community or at least they know about it.\n"}

{"id": "1471151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1471151", "title": "Nouveau réalisme", "text": "Nouveau réalisme\n\nNouveau réalisme (new realism) refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic Pierre Restany and the painter Yves Klein during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the \"Constitutive Declaration of New Realism,\" in April 1960, proclaiming, \"Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real.\" This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: Yves Klein, Arman, Martial Raysse, Pierre Restany, Daniel Spoerri, Jean Tinguely and the Ultra-Lettrists, Francois Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Jacques de la Villeglé; in 1961 these were joined by César, Mimmo Rotella, then Niki de Saint Phalle and Gérard Deschamps. The artist Christo showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.\n\nContemporary of American pop art, and often conceived as its transposition in France, new realism was, along with Fluxus and other groups, one of the numerous tendencies of the avant-garde in the 1960s. The group initially chose Nice, on the French Riviera, as its home base since Klein and Arman both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the movement.\n\nThe term \"new realism\" was first used in May 1960 by Pierre Restany, to describe the works of Omiros, Arman, François Dufrêne, Raymond Hains, Yves Klein, Jean Tinguely and Jacques Villeglé as they exhibited their work in Milan. He had discussed this term before with Yves Klein (who died prematurely in 1962), who preferred the expression \"today's realism\" (\"réalisme d'aujourd'hui\") and criticized the term \"New\". After the first \"Manifesto of New Realism\", a second manifesto, titled \"40° above Dada\" (\"40° au-dessus de Dada\") was written between 17 May and 10 June 1961. César, Mimmo Rotella, Niki de Saint-Phalle (then practicing \"shooting paintings\") Omiros with his \"free space\" and Gérard Deschamps then joined the movement, followed by Christo in 1963. Klein, however, started to distance himself from the group around 1961, disliking Restany's insistence on a Dadaist heritage. \n\nThe first exposition of the \"nouveaux réalistes\" took place in November 1960 at the Paris \"Festival d'avant-garde\". This exposition was followed by others: in May 1961 at the Gallery J. in Paris; \"Premier Festival du Nouveau Réalisme\" in Nice from July til September 1961 at the Muratore Gallery and the Abbaye de Roseland; \"International Exhibition of the New Realists\", a survey of contemporary American pop art and the Nouveau Réalisme movement at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York at the end of 1962; and at the Biennale of San Marino in 1963 (which would be the last collective show by the group). The movement had difficulty maintaining a cohesive program after the death of Yves Klein in June, 1962 and when Omiros abandonned it and decided to go in his own path experimenting with perspective and space.\n\nThe members of the nouveaux réalistes group tended to see the world as an image from which they could take parts and incorporate them into their works—as they sought to bring life and art closer together. They declared that they had come together on the basis of a new and real awareness of their \"collective singularity\", meaning that they were together in spite of, or perhaps because of, their differences. But for all the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct appropriation of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Pierre Restany, to a \"poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality\".\n\nThus the nouveaux réalistes advocated a return to \"reality\" in opposition to the lyricism of abstract painting. They also wanted to avoid what they saw as the traps of figurative art, which was seen as either petty-bourgeois or as Stalinist socialist realism. Hence the Nouveau Réalistes used exterior objects to give an account of the reality of their time. They were the inventor of the \"décollage\" technique (the opposite of collages), in particular through the use of lacerated posters—a technique mastered by François Dufrene, Jacques Villeglé, Mimmo Rotella and Raymond Hains. Often these artists worked collaboratively and it was their intention to present their artworks in the city of Paris anonymously.\n\nNouveau réalistes made extensive use of collage and assemblage, using real objects incorporated directly into the work and acknowledging a debt to the readymades of Marcel Duchamp. But the New Realism movement has often been compared to the pop art movement in New York for their use and critique of mass-produced commercial objects (Villeglé's ripped cinema posters, Arman's collections of detritus and trash), although Nouveau Réalisme maintained closer ties with Dada than with pop art.\n\n\"The new realists\" is also a term applied to a group of Australian architects determined to create a \"New Realism\" in architecture, based on the understanding of past developments in the discipline of architecture and modern day explorations of new technologies in the fields of design and building technology.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44111304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44111304", "title": "Overlapping markup", "text": "Overlapping markup\n\nIn markup languages and the digital humanities, overlap occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-hierarchical manner.\nA document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a tree.\nThis is also known as concurrent markup.\nOverlap happens, for instance, in poetry, where there may be a metrical structure of feet and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.\n\nThe problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving this problem against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an \"ordered hierarchy of content objects\" or \"OHCO\") was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.\nIn 2008, Jeni Tennison identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\".\n\nA distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical one. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (\"self-overlap\").\n\nA scheme may have a \"privileged\" hierarchy.\nSome XML-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;\nthese are said to be \"non-privileged\".\n\n identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: readability and maintainability, tool support and compatibility with XML, possible validation schemes, and ease of processing.\n\nTag soup is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup—it is malformed HTML, which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.\nSome web browsers attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical Document Object Models (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.\nHTML5 defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.\nWith XHTML and SGML-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.\nThe HTML standard defines a paragraph concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be discontiguous.\n\nSGML, which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.\nDTD validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR could not support self-overlap, and it interacted poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.\nThis feature was poorly supported by tools and saw very little actual use;\nusing CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.\n\nThere are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.\nThe Text Encoding Initiative, as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.\nAll four of the below approaches are suggested.\nThe Open Scripture Information Standard is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the Bible.\nIt uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of \"Richard III\" by William Shakespeare will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.\n\n\"Multiple documents\", which provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views. With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with data comparison and delta encoding techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.\n\nExample, with lines marked up:\nWith sentences marked up:\n\"Milestones\" are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure. The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability. CLIX is an example of such an approach.\n\nExample:\nPunctuation and inter-word spaces have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.\n\n\"Joins\" are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a linked list. A single non-privileged element is \"segmented\" into several \"partial\" elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult. While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements. A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.\n\nExample:\n\"Stand-off markup\" is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. Validation of stand-off markup is very challenging. In addition, maintenance is a problem.\n\nExample:\n\nAnother approach is to design an entirely new markup language.\nThese forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.\n\n\nRather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.\nAs an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed multigraphs, most notably the Resource Description Framework (RDF).\nEARMARK is an early RDF/OWL representation that encompasses GODDAGs.\n\nRDF provides different linearizations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes (RDFa). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of Linguistic Linked Open Data.\n\n\n"}

Many of them are very similar and overlap inconsistently in orthography, phonology, and vocabulary. Of the few known efforts, Folkspraak, in different incarnations, is probably the most commonly known pan-Germanic language today.\n\nThe idea behind a zonal constructed language as such is to be easily understood by the speakers of the Germanic languages. However, due to the diversity and variation even between dialects, the largest languages: English, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish usually take precedence to any others. Moreover, some of the pan-languages may attempt to unify subgroups such as the North or West Germanic languages.\n\nThe development of the languages are similar in its process to Interlingua—to create a word or a grammatical form samples are taken from all of the Germanic languages and the form common to most of the languages is selected. Reference is also made to previously existing and parallel Germanic zonal constructed languages.\n\nThe first known active and concise effort to unite the Germanic languages is Tutonish. It was developed by Elias Molee in 1901, and reformed in 1906 and 1915. It was extremely simplistic. The orthography, while straightforward, was not related to any of the existing natural Germanic languages.

It focuses on the extent to which colonialism was an important influence within British culture during the 19th and 20th centuries. The debate was characterised by disagreement between the academic historians Bernard Porter and John MacKenzie. Porter argued that British imperial expansion during the era of New Imperialism had little effect on ordinary people in the United Kingdom, while MacKenzie argued that colonialism dominated British popular culture for much of the period.\n\nThe debate began when Porter's book \"The Absent-Minded Imperialists\" appeared in print in 2004. The book argued that Empire had very little influence on British popular culture in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, arguing that this was the only explanation for the absence during a period of rapid imperial expansion. Porter argued that ordinary British people between 1800 and 1940 were largely indifferent to empire:\n\n\"Absent-Minded Imperialists\" argued against the conclusions of previous academic studies which had stressed the extent to which imperialism had shaped European culture, following Edward Said's \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993). Porter also attacked the conclusions of other works, like MacKenzie's 1984 \"Propaganda and Empire\" which looked at the influence of imperialist propaganda in British culture. Porter was critical of this \"MacKenzie school\" who argued that the influence of imperialist propaganda \"must have been overwhelming if there was so much of it\". According to Porter, \"an alternative reading, however, might be that it could not have been all that persuasive, if the propagandists felt they needed to propagandize so hard.\" Additionally, he critiqued the source base of MacKenzie's study, suggesting that MacKenzie had selected his texts arbitrarily.\n\nThe book received mixed reviews, with the American historian Antoinette Burton rejecting it as not \"worth arguing either with or about\". Some academics argued that the book, which was received well in the popular press, would appeal to British nationalists as absolving them of responsibility for empire; a claim which Porter rejected. In a 2008 article, MacKenzie accused Porter of sidestepping inconvenient evidence by refusing to address it directly, especially when it would affect his argument:\n\nHistorians who are considered to support the MacKenzie position are Catherine Hall, Antoinette Burton and Jeffrey Richards. Andrew Thompson notably supported Porter. Thompson argues that there was no one ‘imperial culture’ in the nineteenth century and that empire had a complicated position in British culture.\n\n\n\n"}

For a person to be residing \"under color of law,\" the USCIS must know of the person’s presence in the U.S., and must provide the person with written assurance that enforcement of deportation is not planned. A person residing under PRUCOL status cannot directly apply for U.S. citizenship or sponsor family members to obtain U.S. Citizenship. \nA person from any country, who resides in the United States without current legal immigration status including, but not limited to, citizenship, permanent residency, unexpired immigrant visa, is an undocumented person. Though they are not U.S. citizens, they are considered to have the same rights as legal residents ‘for welfare eligibility purposes’. \nUnder what came to be known as the \"PRUCOL\" doctrine, expounded by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Holley v. Lavine, even an alien who was unquestionably present in the United States contrary to law could be PRUCOL. In the statutes defining eligibility criteria for federal benefits, the U.S. Congress provided for payment of benefits, not only to lawful immigrants, but to aliens \"permanently residing under color of law.\" Thus, if the USCIS is aware of the alien's unlawful presence, but was not actively pursuing his or her deportation, the alien is eligible for benefits. Under this doctrine aliens with no legal right to remain in the United States are nevertheless eligible for public assistance. \n\nThe Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (\"PRWORA\") basically abolished the PRUCOL Doctrine by creating a new statutory definition of \"qualified alien.\" It is true that the expression \"permanently residing under color of law\" remains in many Federal, State and City statutes and regulations; but, with a few exceptions clearly specified by statute, an alien \"who is not a qualified alien is not eligible for any Federal public benefit.\" Congress has also made aliens ineligible for many public benefits available under State and local law.\n\nSection 153 of the Federal Immigration Act of 1990 provides Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (SIJS) to undocumented children who (1) are under 21, (2) are unmarried, (3) have been abandoned, neglected or abused by at least one birth parent, (4) have been declared dependent on the juvenile court (often through a guardianship proceeding) or deemed eligible for long-term foster care, and (5) for whom the court has declared that it is not in the child’s best interest to be returned to his country of origin. A grant of SIJS does not automatically confer lawful permanent resident status; instead, it makes the child eligible to apply for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent resident.\n\nSometimes the derogatory term \"anchor baby\" is wrongly used to describe a child under PRUCOL status. The confusion stems from the fact that, because children born in the U.S. of one or two undocumented parents are U.S. citizens; once they become adults they may petition for their parents to gain legal status. The person under PRUCOL status is the parent, not the baby.\n\nIf a sibling petitions for the family member who entered the US without a visa, a return to and wait in the country of origin is mandatory.\n\nIn general persons attain PRUCOL status by reason of a court decision of “stay of deportation”. In many cases it is left to the individual city or state benefits agency to decide if a person has this status. For additional information on one Agency’s definition of PRUCOL see Office of the New York City Mayor, Public Health Insurance Options \n\nUnder Florida law, only U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, or a someone holding PRUCOL status is eligible for a Homestead Exemption. A person in the U.S. with asylum or parole refugee status is considered PRUCOL. \nA person in the US under an E-, F-, H-, J-, L-, M-, N-, O-, P-, TC- or R-class visa is NOT eligible for Homestead, pursuant to Rule 12D-7.007(3), Florida Administrative Code, as they are all deemed \"temporary\" visas.

The area in which Qingdao is located today was named Jiao'ao () when it was administered by the Qing Dynasty on 14 June 1891.\n\nIn 1891, the Qing Empire decided to make coastal Tsingtao (Jiao'ao) a defense base against naval attack and began to improve its fortifications. Imperial German naval officials observed and reported on this activity during a formal survey of Jiaozhou Bay in May 1897. Subsequently, German troops seized and occupied the fortification. The unmodernised and ineffective Qing Empire was forced to concede the area to Germany the following year, and the Kiautschou Bay concession, as it became known, existed from 1898 to 1914 (Li 2005, p. 81). With an area of , it was located in the imperial province of Shandong (alternately romanised as Shantung or Shan-tung) on the southern coast of the Shandong Peninsula in northern China. Jiaozhou was romanised as Kiaochow, Kiauchau or Kiao-Chau in English and Kiautschou in German. Qingdao was its administrative center. \"The so-called \"Marktstrasse\" (Market street) was nothing more than the old main street of the Chinese village of Tsingtao, and the buildings lining it were the former homes of fishermen and farmers. Having sold their property, they resettled their homes and fields in the villages further east.\" Upon gaining control of the area, the Germans outfitted the impoverished fishing village of \"Tsingtao\" (Qingdao) with wide streets, solid housing areas, government buildings, electrification throughout, a sewer system and a safe drinking water supply, a rarity in large parts of Asia at that time and later. The area had the highest school density and the highest \"per capita\" student enrollment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Imperial German treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. Commercial interests established the Germania Brewery in 1903, which later became the world-famous Tsingtao Brewery. German cultural and commercial influences extended to other areas of Shandong Province, including the establishment of diverse commercial enterprises.\n\nIdentified by the German authorities as a strategically important port, Qingdao was administered by the Imperial Department of the Navy (\"Reichsmarineamt\") rather than the Imperial Colonial Office (\"Reichskolonialamt\"). The growing Imperial German Navy based their Far East Squadron there, allowing the warships to conduct operations throughout the western Pacific. Beginning January 1898, the marines of \"III. Seebataillon\" were based at Tsingtao. Construction of the Jiaoji Railway began on September 23, 1899, and was completed in 1904.\n\nBefore the outbreak of World War I (1914-1918), ships of the German naval forces under Admiral Count von Spee were located at central Pacific colonies on routine missions. The fleet then rendezvoused in the Marianas Islands to plan a transit back to Germany rather than be trapped in the Pacific by more powerful and numerous Allied fleets (British and Japanese).\n\nAfter a minor British naval attack on the German colony on Shandong in 1914, Japanese Empire troops occupied the city and the surrounding province during the Siege of Tsingtao after Japan's declaration of war on Germany in accordance with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. China protested Japan's violation of her neutrality but was not able to interfere in the military operations. The decision of the Paris Peace Conference and the Versailles Treaty negotiations not to restore Chinese rule over the previous foreign concessions in Qingdao after the Great War triggered the May Fourth Movement (May 4, 1919) of anti-imperialism, nationalism and cultural identity in China.\nThe city came under Chinese rule in December 1922, under control of the Republic of China (R.O.C.) established 1912 after the Chinese Revolution the year before. However, Japan maintained its economic dominance of the railway and the province as a whole. The city became a direct-controlled municipality of the ROC Government in July 1929.\n\nJapan re-occupied Qingdao in 1938, a year after its expansion of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945), (a precursor to World War II, 1939-1945) with its plans of territorial expansion into China's coast. Nationalist (Kuomintang) ROC forces returned after the Japanese surrender in September 1945. On June 2, 1949, shortly before the founding of the communist People’s Republic of China on October 1, 1949 the city was taken by Chairman Mao Zedong and his troops.\n\nThe development of the Tsingtao urban space during the German-occupation (1891–1914) originated from the port. Mass urban construction began in 1898 with the relocation of Chinese dwellers along the coast. With the completion of such series of projects as wharves, Tsingtao-Jinan Railway Line, Tsingtao Railway Station and locomotive works, a city was starting to take shape. The area had the highest school density and highest per capita student enrolment in all of China, with primary, secondary and vocational schools funded by the Berlin treasury and Protestant and Roman Catholic missions. In 1910, the Germans drew up for the second time the city planning of Tsingtao (Warner 2001, p. 33). The former urban area was extended for four times highlighted by the emphasis on the development of commerce and trade. Sun Yat-sen (1866–1925), leader of the Chinese Revolution of 1911 and subsequent first president of the Republic of China, visited the Tsingtau area and stated in 1912, \"I am impressed. The city is a true model for China's future\".\n\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the first Japan-occupation period (1914–1922). In 1914, Tsingtao was taken over by Japanese and served as a base for the exploitation of natural resources of Shandong and northern China. With the development of industry and commerce, a \"New City District\" was established to furnish the Japanese colonists with commercial sections and living quarters, which suggested a striking contrast to the shabby houses in the local Chinese zones(Li 2007, p. 133). In the meantime, a number of schools, hospitals and public buildings were constructed, followed by urban streets and intercity highways as well. The urban spatial layout continued to expand northward along the eastern bay area.\n\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the ROC-ruled period (1922–1938). This period saw the substantial progress of the urban development of Tsingtao. The government engaged itself in mass construction that gave birth to villa districts at the beach and bank groups in CBD. Plenty of public buildings and facilities for the purpose of entertainment and sports were completed. By the year of 1937, the urban population numbered 385,000(Lu 2001, p. 327). Tsingtao consequently distinguished itself as a prominent holiday resort and summer retreat.\n\nThe development of Tsingtao urban space during the second Japan-occupied period (1938–1945). Japan staged a comeback to Tsingtao in 1938 and started to strive for the construction of the Greater Tsingtao in the following June. Accordingly, they worked out the City Planning of the Greater Tsingtao and the City Planning of the Mother Town (Tsingtao City Proper), even though they had not had the opportunity to realise them respectively. The period in question did not witness much urban progress except for the logical construction of No. 6 Wharf, some Japanese residences and a small number of roads and streets(Lu 2001, p. 339).\n\nAfter World War II the KMT allowed Qingdao to serve as the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet of the US Navy in 1945. On 2 June 1949, the CCP-led Red Army entered Qingdao and the city and province have been under PRC control since that time.\n\nSince the 1984 inauguration of China's open-door policy to foreign trade and investment, western Qingdao developed quickly as a port city. It is now the headquarters of the Chinese navy's northern fleet. An early example of the open-door policy occurred on 5 November 1984, when three United States Naval vessels visited Qingdao. This was the first US port call in more than 37 years to China. , , and and their crews were officially hosted by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN).\n\nNorthern Qingdao, particularly Shibei, Licang, and Chengyang districts, are now major manufacturing centers. The city has recently experienced a strong growth period, with a new central business district created to the east of the older business district. Outside of the center of the city, there is a large industrial zone, which includes chemical processing, rubber and heavy manufacturing, in addition to a growing high-tech area. Numerous local and national service companies, rather than manufacturers, are based in the city's southern district; this, as well as local wind patterns, allows Qingdao to enjoy clean, clear air year round.\n\nThe sub-provincial city of Qingdao has 7 districts (区 \"qu\") and 3 county-level cities (市 \"shi\"):\n\nGeographically, there are four districts (Shinan, Shibei, Licang and Laoshan) constituting a peninsula on the east coast of the Jiaozhou Bay as the core urban area, one (Chengyang) on the north coast and one (Xihai'an) on the west coast of the Yellow Sea.\n\nQingdao is located on the south facing coast of the Shandong Peninsula (). It borders three prefecture-level cities, namely Yantai to the northeast, Weifang to the west, and Rizhao to the southwest. The city's total jurisdiction area occupies , and stretches in latitude from 35° 35' to 37° 09' N and in longitude from 119° 30' to 121° 00' E. The populated sections of the city are relatively flat while mountains spur up within city limits and nearby. The highest elevation in the city is above sea level. Of the total area of Qingdao, 15.5% is highland, while the foothill, plain and lowland areas constitute 25.1%, 37.8% and 21.7%. The city has a coastline. Five significant rivers that flow for more than can be found in the region.\n\nQingdao has a temperate, four-season, monsoon-influenced climate that lies in the transition between the humid subtropical (Köppen \"Cwa\") and humid continental (Köppen \"Dwa\") regimes, but favouring the former. Winter is cool to cold and windy, but generally dry, with a January average of . Summer is generally hot and humid, but very hot days are rare, with an August average of . Due to its proximity to the coast and being on a peninsula, it experiences a one-month delayed spring compared to most inland areas of China, and the annual diurnal temperature variation is only . Conversely, autumn is milder than inland areas in Shandong. The water temperature peaks at about in late August, with swimming possible two months on either side. The annual mean temperature is . Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 16 January 1958 to on 15 July 2002.\n\nDuring the summer months, the beaches of Qingdao are afflicted by massive algal blooms. The decomposing algae release large amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas, which gives off the odour of rotten eggs. The blooms of sea lettuce, which are partially caused by seaweed farming in Jiangsu Province, led local officials to declare a \"large-scale algae disaster\" in 2013.\n\nBy the end of 2006, Qingdao was estimated to be the home of about 8 million inhabitants, of which around 3 million reside in the Qingdao urban area. Another estimated 5 million live in other cities under Qingdao's jurisdiction. The annual birth rate is calculated around 76,507, with a birth rate of 10.15 per year per thousand, and a death rate of 6.32, both calculated on an annual basis. Living standards are among the highest of leading Chinese cities due to the strong export economy and relatively high family wages.\n\nQingdao is home to 38 Chinese ethnic minorities, which account for 0.14% of the city's total population.\n\nThere is a large Korean community in Qingdao. By 2009, there are approximately 100,000 Koreans working, studying and living in Qingdao, which makes Qingdao the second in terms of Korean population in China, following Beijing which has about 200,000 Koreans.\n\nAn important region in Eastern China, Shandong Province has seen substantial change in its economic landscape in recent years. Much of this development has been concentrated in Qingdao. Qingdao has seen rapid development. With an annual growth rate of 18.9 percent in 2006, the city's GDP reached 42.3 billion, ranking first in Shandong Province and tenth out of China's top 20 cities. GDP per capita comprised ¥52,895 (US$7,616) in 2008. The GDP has grown steadily at an average pace of 16% annually. In 2006, Qingdao was ranked one of six \"golden cities\" by the World Bank, out of 120 Chinese cities assessed on factors including investment climate and government effectiveness.\n\nInternationally, Qingdao is perhaps best known for its Tsingtao Brewery, founded by a German-British joint venture in 1903 that produces Tsingtao beer, the best-known Chinese export beer. It is also home to Haier, a large white goods manufacturer, and Hisense, a major electronics company. In 2002 guitar manufacturers Epiphone opened a factory in Qingdao.\n\nIn 1984 the Chinese government named a district of Qingdao a Special Economic and Technology Development Zone (SETDZ). Along with this district, the entire city had gone through amazing development of secondary and tertiary industries. As an important trading port in the province, Qingdao flourishes with foreign investment and international trade. South Korea and Japan in particular made extensive investment in the city. Approximately 80,000 South Korean citizens reside there. Construction proceeds at a relatively fast pace in Qingdao.\n\nIn terms of primary industry, Qingdao has an estimated of arable land. Qingdao has a zigzagging pattern coastline, and thus possesses an invaluable stock of fish, shrimp, and other sea resources.\n\nQingdao is also home to a variety of mineral resources. Up to thirty different kinds have been mined. \n\nQingdao's wind power electricity generation performs at among the highest levels in the region.\n\n\nThere are a total of of roads in the Qingdao area, with nearly of expressways. These National Trunk Highway System (NTHS) Expressways begin or pass through in Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\nSpur Route: G2011 Qingxin Expressway (Qingdao-Xinhe, Pingdu, Shandong)\n\nThese provincial expressways begin in or pass through Qingdao. Expressways that begin in Qingdao are in Bold:\n\n\nOther than Expressways, there are also National Highways that pass through or begin in Qingdao. National Highways that begin in Qingdao are in bold:\n\n\nOn June 30, 2011, the longest bridge over water opened in Qingdao. The bridge, Haiwan Bridge, is long and connects Qingdao to an offshore island, Huangdao. It would easily cross the English Channel and is almost three miles () longer than the previous record-holder, the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway in the American state of Louisiana. Haiwan Bridge is supported by more than 5,000 pillars and costs about 10 billion yuan which is about 1.5 billion dollars. The bridge was designed by the Shandong Gausu Group and the construction lasted for four years. Haiwan Bridge cut the commute between the city of Qingdao and the sprawling suburb of Huangdao by 30 minutes. At least 10,000 workers toiled in two teams around the clock to build the bridge, which was constructed from opposite ends. On the same day, the Jiaozhou Bay Tunnel opened.The tunnel brought much convenience to people by supporting public buses and making transport between the two areas more convenient.\n\n\"Also see Port of Qingdao\"\n\nQingdao (official name: Qingdao port international co. ltd.) hosts one of the world's busiest seaports. Cooperative relations have been established with 450 ports in 130 countries worldwide. In 2003, the annual cargo handling capacity exceeded 100 million tons for the first time. The number of containers reached of cargoes. By 2011, the port had become the world’s sixth-busiest by Total Cargo Volume, having handled 372 million tonnes of cargo in that year. As of 2016, it was the 8th in the world in terms of TEUs (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units).\n\nThe \"Orient Ferry\" connects Qingdao with Shimonoseki, Japan. There are two ferry lines connecting Qingdao with South Korea. The \"New Golden Bridge II\" operates between Qingdao and Incheon, and the \"Blue Sea Ferry\" operates between Qingdao and Gunsan.\n\nQingdao port also includes a number of large adjacent ports including Dongjiakou.\n\nThe Qingdao Liuting International Airport, away from city centre, is served by 13 domestic and international airlines, operating 94 routes, 12 of which are international and regional. In 2011, Qingdao Liuting International Airport was the 16th busiest airport in the People's Republic of China with 11,716,361 passengers. A new civil aviation airport with much larger capacities will be built in Jiaozhou District.\n\nQingdao's railway development was picked up during the late 1990s. It is at the beginning of the Jiaoji Railway. Qingdao's city proper has some major railway stations, Qingdao Station, Sifang Station, Cangkou Station, Great-Seaport Station, etc.\n\nD and G series High speed trains travel on the Jiaoji High Speed Railway and reach speeds of on the Jinan-Qingdao Section. Services go to Beijing, Shanghai, Hefei, Jinan and Tianjin.\n\nDomestic rail lines connect Qingdao with many cities in China including Beijing, Lanzhou, Chengdu, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Jinan and Jining.\n\nQingdao's public traffic owns 5283 large and medium-sized buses, CNG buses .There are also 136 trolleybuses . All of the buses and trolleybuses can be accessed using the Qingdao Public Traffic IC Card (), which uses radio frequencies so the card does not have to physically touch the scanner. Non air-conditioned busses cost 1 yuan, The volume of road passenger transport approaches 0.8 billion per year. The Public Transport Brand of 'Ri-Xin Bus ()' is also known in China.\n\nThere are a number of taxi companies in Qingdao including Yiqing Company, Zhongqing Company, Jiaoyun Company and, Huaqing Company.\n\nAfter getting the approval from the State Council, the government announced on 18 August 2009 that Qingdao is ready to spend more than 29 billion yuan ($4.2 billion) before 2016 on its subway construction. Construction of of subway line will be completed before 2016 with a total investment of 29.2 billion yuan ($4.3 billion). Metro Line 3 is the first line in function and opened on 16 December 2015. In the long term, the city plans to build eight subway lines in downtown and some suburban districts, which account for in future. As of June 2018, the system has an operating length of .\n\nQingdao is headquarters of the North Sea Fleet of the People's Liberation Army Navy.\n\nThere is a large number of German-style buildings in Qingdao city centre, remarkable considering the German colonial period only lasted 16 years (1898–1914). The unique combination of German and Chinese architecture in the city centre, combined with German demographic roots and a large Korean expatriate population, gives Qingdao a distinct atmosphere. An old saying described Qingdao as a city of \"red tiles green trees, blue sky and blue sea.\" This saying indeed gives a picture of birdview of Qingdao. A larger number of areas in former foreign styles are well preserved. Although the new city area is under large-scale reconstruction, the old city area (especially the western part of Shinan District) still retains many traditional buildings.\n\n\n\nDuring the city's colonial days, German was the official language and rigorously taught and promoted. Since the demise of Germany's colonial empire during World War I, the German language is virtually dead here and left little impact on the local languages. A local accent known as Qingdao dialect (青岛话, pinyin \"qingdao hua\") distinguishes the residents of the city from those of the surrounding Shandong province. Due to the efforts by the city government to promote standard Mandarin, most educated people can speak standard Mandarin in addition to their native dialect. With reform policies and English teaching, some young citizens have been taught English and many can converse with English-speaking foreigners. Business and traffic signs in English are becoming more and more common.\n\nSeafood is a typical delicacy of the coastal city, divided into two categories: \"Great Seafood\" including sea cucumbers, abalones, shark's fin, prawns, crabs, conch, and some big fish, and \"Little Seafood\" comprising squid, shrimps, octopus, oysters, razor clams, clams, periwinkles, yellow croakers, etc.\n\nThe distinctive cuisine of the area is Lu Cai, the Shandong regional style.\n\nNotable festivals include:\n\nQingdao previously had a large German community and a German garrison, so three German newspapers operated in Qingdao. German papers included \"Deutsch-Asiatische Warte\" (T: 泰東古今鑑, S: 泰东古今鉴, P: \"Tàidōng Gǔjīn Jiàn\"; weekly newspaper published until 1906, included \"Die Welt des Ostens, Altes und Neues aus Asiens drei Kaiserreichen\", a cultural supplement), the \"Tsingtauer Neueste Nachrichten\" and the \"Kiautschou Post\" (a daily paper published from 1908 to 1912, referring to the Kiautschou (Jiaozhou) Bay concession). German publishing in Qingdao ended after World War I and the beginning of the Japanese administration.\n\nA 1912 publication of the United States Department of Commerce, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce said that the \"Tageblatt für Nordchina\" of Tianjin was read in Qingdao, and that major newspapers from Shanghai were also read in Qingdao.\n\nQingdao attracts many tourists due to its seaside setting and temperate weather. Parks, beaches, sculptures and unique German and modern architecture line the shore. The central tourist information, the Qingdao Information Centre for International Visitors, is located on Middle Hong Kong Road (香港中路).\n\nQingdao's major attractions include:\n\n\n\n\n\nQingdao is home to a large number of higher education institutions. Ocean University of China, formerly called Ocean University of Qingdao, is the most important university of maritime sciences in China. In addition, the Qingdao University, the Qingdao University of Science and Technology as well as the Qingdao Technological University have also been integral parts of higher education in Qingdao for decades. Other institutions include:\n\n\nShandong University was located in Qingdao from 1909 to 1936. A new branch campus of the university is under construction in Aoshanwei Town, Jimo.\n\n\n\nQingdao has long been a hub of professional sports in The People's Republic of China.\n\n\nAlong with Beijing's hosting of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Qingdao was the host city for the Olympic Sailing competitions which took place along the shoreline by the city. These events were hosted at the Qingdao International Sailing Centre and held in Fushan Bay, near the city's central business district. A hotel and an international broadcasting centre were built.\n\nQingdao is recognized as one of the \"football cities\" in China, due to dozens of preeminent players it trained like Qu Bo, Zheng Long, Yu Dabao, Liu Jian and Jiang Ning .However, due to lack of money of the sponsors of football clubs in Qingdao, its football potential has reduced.\n\nQingdao Jonoon F.C. (previously named Qingdao Hainiu Football Club) was founded in 1993. It is one of the founding members of the second-division of Chinese professional football league. They got the championship in their first season in 1994 and were promoted to the Chinese Jia-A League. In 1995, they finished 11th (out of a total 12 teams) and were relegated from the top league. Only one year later, after finishing as runner-up in the second-division, they returned to the top league. They have been part of Chinese Super League from its inauguration in 2004.In 2013, they were relegated to the China League One and in 2016 relegated to the China League Two.\n\nQingdao Huanghai F.C. was established on 29 January 2013. In their first season in the Chinese Football Association Division Two League, they finished the first in league and got to the China League One. Up to June 13, 2016, they had been on the first and had a great chance to get into the Super League after the season. Fans in China called them \"Chinese Barcelona\".\n\nQingdao DoubleStar Eagles is a Chinese professional basketball team which plays in the North Division of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nQingdao Renzhou Badminton Club is a Chinese badminton club which plays in the China Badminton Super League.\n\nQingdao Clipper is a professional arena football team which is a member of the China Arena Football League(CAFL).\n\nThe IZOD IndyCar Series signed a contract with the Qingdao city council to hold an IndyCar race in Qingdao in 2012. The race was supposed to take place on a street circuit but it was cancelled.\n\nQingdao is one of the few cities in northern China where surfing is possible. The best surfing season is during the typhoon season (June–October). The south oriented beaches of Qingdao are the most appropriate to receive swells. Shinan and Laoshan districts are reported to have the best wave and wind orientation.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50222574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50222574", "title": "Semantic folding", "text": "Semantic folding\n\nSemantic folding theory describes a procedure for encoding the semantics of natural language text in a semantically grounded binary representation. This approach provides a framework for modelling how language data is processed by the neocortex.\n\nSemantic folding theory draws inspiration from Douglas R. Hofstadter's \"Analogy as the Core of Cognition\" which suggests that the brain makes sense of the world by identifying and applying analogies. The theory hypothesises that semantic data must therefore be introduced to the neocortex in such a form as to allow the application of a similarity measure and offers, as a solution, the sparse binary vector employing a two-dimensional topographic semantic space as a distributional reference frame. The theory builds on the computational theory of the human cortex known as hierarchical temporal memory (HTM), and positions itself as a complementary theory for the representation of language semantics.\n\nA particular strength claimed by this approach is that the resulting binary representation enables complex semantic operations to be performed simply and efficiently at the most basic computational level.\n\nAnalogous to the structure of the neocortex, Semantic Folding theory posits the implementation of a semantic space as a two-dimensional grid. This grid is populated by context-vectors in such a way as to place similar context-vectors closer to each other, for instance, by using competitive learning principles. This vector space model is presented in the theory as an equivalence to the well known word space model described in the Information Retrieval literature.\n\nGiven a semantic space (implemented as described above) a word-vector can be obtained for any given word Y by employing the following algorithm:\n\nFor each position X in the semantic map (where X represents cartesian coordinates)\n\nThe result of this process will be a word-vector containing all the contexts in which the word Y appears and will therefore be representative of the semantics of that word in the semantic space. It can be seen that the resulting word-vector is also in a sparse distributed representation (SDR) format [Schütze, 1993] & [Sahlgreen, 2006]. Some properties of word-SDRs that are of particular interest with respect to computational semantics are:\n\nSemantic spaces in the natural language domain aim to create representations of natural language that are capable of capturing meaning. The original motivation for semantic spaces stems from two core challenges of natural language: Vocabulary mismatch (the fact that the same meaning can be expressed in many ways) and ambiguity of natural language (the fact that the same term can have several meanings).\n\nThe application of semantic spaces in natural language processing (NLP) aims at overcoming limitations of rule-based or model-based approaches operating on the keyword level. The main drawback with these approaches is their brittleness, and the large manual effort required to create either rule-based NLP systems or training corpora for model learning. Rule-based and machine learning based models are fixed on the keyword level and break down if the vocabulary differs from that defined in the rules or from the training material used for the statistical models.\n\nResearch in semantic spaces dates back more than 20 years. In 1996, two papers were published that raised a lot of attention around the general idea of creating semantic spaces: latent semantic analysis from Microsoft and Hyperspace Analogue to Language from the University of California. However, their adoption was limited by the large computational effort required to construct and use those semantic spaces. A breakthrough with regard to the accuracy of modelling associative relations between words (e.g. \"spider-web\", \"lighter-cigarette\", as opposed to synonymous relations such as \"whale-dolphin\", \"astronaut-driver\") was achieved by explicit semantic analysis (ESA) in 2007. ESA was a novel (non-machine learning) based approach that represented words in the form of vectors with 100,000 dimensions (where each dimension represents an Article in Wikipedia). However practical applications of the approach are limited due to the large number of required dimensions in the vectors.\n\nMore recently, advances in neural networking techniques in combination with other new approaches (tensors) led to a host of new recent developments: Word2vec from Google and GloVe from Stanford University.\n\nSemantic folding represents a novel, biologically inspired approach to semantic spaces where each word is represented as a sparse binary vector with 16,000 dimensions (a semantic fingerprint) in a 2D semantic map (the semantic universe). Sparse binary representation are advantageous in terms of computational efficiency, and allow for the storage of very large numbers of possible patterns.\n\nThe topological distribution over a two-dimensional grid (outlined above) lends itself to a bitmap type visualization of the semantics of any word or text, where each active semantic feature can be displayed as e.g. a pixel. As can be seen in the images shown here, this representation allows for a direct visual comparison of the semantics of two (or more) linguistic items.\n\nImage 1 clearly demonstrates that the two disparate terms \"dog\" and \"car\" have, as expected, very obviously different semantics.\n\nImage 2 shows that only one of the meaning contexts of \"jaguar\", that of \"Jaguar\" the car, overlaps with the meaning of Porsche (indicating partial similarity). Other meaning contexts of \"jaguar\" e.g. \"jaguar\" the animal clearly have different non-overlapping contexts.\n\nNote also that the visualization of semantic similarity using Semantic Folding bears a strong resemblance to the fMRI images produced in a research study conducted by A.G. Huth et al., where it is claimed that words are grouped in the brain by meaning.\n"}

It is in the historic Glendower Street and Agincourt Street neighbourhood, within the medieval town walls. The building initially served as a gymnasium and was a gift from Lady Llangattock to the town of Monmouth. In 1924, after the benefactor's death, it reopened as the Nelson Museum, and showcased the collection of memorabilia related to Admiral Horatio Nelson that had been amassed by the baroness. The Nelson Museum moved to new quarters at the Market Hall in 1969. The former gymnasium and museum is now an apartment building.\n\nThe Nelson Rooms at 2 Glendower Street in Monmouth is a 19th-century, grade II listed building. It is located at the corner of Glendower Street and Agincourt Street, within the medieval town walls. The street on which it is situated was referred to as Grinders Street in the medieval period. The building was constructed in the late 19th century and has undergone little alteration of its exterior in the interim. It was built by Lady Llangattock (1837–1923) as the Working Men's Gymnasium.\n\nLady Llangatock, née Georgiana Marcia Maclean, was the wife of John Allan Rolls, 1st Baron Llangattock (1837–1912). Lord and Lady Llangattock were the parents of four children, including their youngest son Charles Stewart Rolls (1877–1910). Their son Charles co-founded Rolls-Royce Limited and was an aviation enthusiast. In 1910, he became the first Englishman to die in an aviation accident when his Wright biplane crashed at Bournemouth. Lady Llangattock lost her husband and all three of her sons in a six-year period. Lord Llangattock died in October 1912, and their two surviving sons, John Maclean Rolls and Henry Allan Rolls, both died in 1916 during World War I.\n\nGeorgiana Rolls donated the Working Men's Gymnasium to the town of Monmouth in the late 19th century. In 1901, Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire referred to the gym on Glendower Street as the Monmouth Gymnasium and revealed that it was staffed by John B. Hyam and Ernest William Hyam. The former, with the title Honorable Secretary, presumably was the John Benjamin Hyam who appeared on the same record as a manufacturer and merchant at Hyam's Mineral Water Works. While the connection of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson to Monmouth was somewhat tenuous, Georgiana, Lady Llangatock, became an avid collector of memorabilia related to the admiral. The Nelson Collection was a bequest to Monmouth from Lady Llangattock upon her death in 1923.\n\nThe Nelson Museum was established at the former Monmouth Gymnasium in 1924 and the collection amassed by Lady Llangattock formed the core of its offerings. One of the most renowned items in the museum's collection is the set of leather-bound volumes containing the letters of Horatio Nelson to his spouse, one of them holding the wedding ring of Lady Nelson. In 1934, the Misses F. and G. Thomas were the museum curators. The Nelson Museum moved from the former gymnasium on Glendower Street to its present quarters at the Market Hall on Priory Street in 1969, six years after a fire that had ravaged the Market Hall. In addition to the admiral's relics, the Monmouth Museum's collection includes information about Lady Llangattock's famed son Charles Stewart Rolls. After the museum's transfer to Priory Street, the history collections for Monmouth were included in the exhibits. Accordingly, the Monmouth Museum is also referred to as the Nelson Museum and Local History Centre.\n\nThe building at Glendower Street is thought to have been the design of Benjamin Lawrence, a Newport architect who designed the Working Men's Free Institute at 1 Monk Street for Lady Llangattock as well. Lawrence was also the architect of the Monmouth Baptist Church on Monk Street. The building derives its current name, The Nelson Rooms, from the Nelson Museum which was housed there before the museum's move in 1969. It was grade II listed on 8 October 2005.\n\nDuring the interval since the move of the museum, the building served for a time as an auction venue, and more recently has been converted to residential apartments. In February 2006, an application was submitted to the Monmouthshire County Council, requesting permission to convert the listed building to three flats; approval was granted the following August. In April 2008, another application was submitted to the Monmouthshire County Council, requesting that further renovation of the Glendower Street building be permitted for its continued use as apartments; the modifications were approved the following June.\n\nThe building is situated with one elevation along Glendower Street and its gable end facing Agincourt Street. The 19th-century, two storey building has a first floor which is of substantially greater height than the ground floor. It is constructed of red sandstone rubble, and has contrasting Bath Stone quoins and trim. The Glendower Street elevation features an oriel window with a castellated parapet and stone apron. The Agincourt Street facade features a canted bay and another window with castellated parapet and apron. Three band courses run the length of the circumference of the building.\n\n\n"}

Shortly after Alexander's death in Babylon, the possession of his body became a subject of negotiations between Perdiccas, Ptolemy I Soter, and Seleucus I Nicator. According to Nicholas J. Saunders, while Babylon was the \"obvious site\" for Alexander's resting place, some favored interring the ruler in the Argead burial at Aegae, modern Vergina. Aegae was one of the two originally proposed resting places, according to Saunders, the other being Siwa Oasis and in 321 BC Perdiccas presumably chose Aegae. The body, however, was hijacked en route by Ptolemy I Soter. According to Pausanias and the contemporary Parian Chronicle records for the years 321–320 BC, Ptolemy initially buried Alexander in Memphis. In the late 4th or early 3rd century BC, during the early Ptolemaic dynasty, Alexander's body was transferred from Memphis to Alexandria, where it was reburied.\n\nThe so-called Alexander Sarcophagus, unrelated to Alexander's body and once thought to be the sarcophagus of Abdalonymus, is now believed to be that of Mazacus, a Persian governor of Babylon.\n\nAccording to Quintus Curtius Rufus and Justin, Alexander asked shortly before his death to be interred in the temple of Zeus Ammon at Siwah Oasis. Alexander, who requested to be referred to and perceived as the son of Zeus Ammon, did not wish to be buried alongside his actual father at Aegae. Alexander's body was placed in a coffin of \"hammered gold\", according to Diodorus, which was \"fitted to the body\". The coffin is also mentioned by Strabo and Curtius Rufus (subsequently, in 89–90 BC the golden coffin was melted down and replaced with that of glass or crystal).\n\nAlexander's wish to be interred in Siwa was not honored. In 321 BC, on its way back to Macedonia, the funerary cart with Alexander's body was hijacked in Syria by one of Alexander's generals, Ptolemy I Soter. In late 322 or early 321 BC Ptolemy diverted the body to Egypt where it was interred in Memphis, the center of Alexander's government in Egypt. While Ptolemy was in possession of Alexander's body, Perdiccas and Eumenes had Alexander's armor, diadem and royal scepter.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, who visited Alexandria, Python of Catana and Seleucus were sent to a serapeum to ask the oracle whether Alexander's body should be sent to Alexandria and the oracle answered positively. In the late 4th or early 3rd century BC Alexander's body was transferred from the Memphis tomb to Alexandria for reburial (by Ptolemy Philadelphus in , according to Pausanias). Later Ptolemy Philopator placed Alexander's body in Alexandria's communal mausoleum. The mausoleum was called the Soma or Sema, which means \"body\" in Greek. By 274 BC Alexander was already entombed in Alexandria. The Tomb of Alexander became the focal point for the Ptolemaic cult of Alexander the Great.\n\nIn 48 BC Alexander's tomb was visited by Caesar. To finance her war against Octavian, Cleopatra took gold from the tomb. Shortly after the death of Cleopatra, Alexander's resting place was visited by Octavian, who is said to have placed flowers on the tomb and a golden diadem upon Alexander's head. According to Suetonius, Alexander's tomb was then partially looted by Caligula, who reportedly removed his breastplate. In AD 199 Alexander's tomb was sealed up by Septimius Severus during his visit to Alexandria. Later, in 215 some items from Alexander's tomb were relocated by Caracalla. According to chronicler John of Antioch, Caracalla removed Alexander's tunic, his ring, his belt with some other precious items and deposited them on the coffin.\n\nWhen John Chrysostom visited Alexandria in AD 400, he asked to see Alexander’s tomb and remarked, \"his tomb even his own people know not\". Later authors, such as Ibn 'Abd al-Hakam (b. AD 803), Al-Masudi (b. AD 896) and Leo the African (b. 1494), report having seen Alexander's tomb. Leo the African, who visited Alexandria as a young man, wrote: \"In the midst of the ruins of Alexandria, there still remains a small edifice, built like a chapel, worthy of notice on account of a remarkable tomb held in high honor by the Mahometans; in which sepulchre, they assert, is preserved the body of Alexander the Great... An immense crowd of strangers come thither, even from distant countries, for the sake of worshipping and doing homage to the tomb, on which they likewise frequently bestow considerable donations\". George Sandys, who visited Alexandria in 1611, was reportedly shown a sepulchre there, venerated as the resting place of Alexander.\n\nThe Egyptian Supreme Council for Antiquities has officially recognized over 140 search attempts for Alexander's tomb. Mahmoud el-Falaki (1815-1885), who compiled the map of ancient Alexandria, believed Alexander's tomb is in the center of Alexandria, at the intersection of the Via Canopica (modern Horreya Avenue) and the ancient street labeled R5. Since then several other scholars such as Tasos Neroutsos, Heinrich Kiepert and Ernst von Sieglin placed the tomb in the same area. In 1850 Ambroise Schilizzi announced the discovery of alleged Alexander's mummy and tomb inside the Nabi Daniel Mosque in Alexandria. Later, in 1879 a stone worker accidentally broke through the vaulted chamber inside the basement of that mosque. Some granite monuments with an angular summit were discerned there, but the entrance was then walled up and the stone worker was asked not to disclose the incident (the image on a Roman lamp in the National Museum of Poznań and others at the British Museum and the Hermitage Museum are interpreted by some scholars as showing Alexandria with the Soma Mausoleum pictured as a building with a pyramidal roof). In 1888 Heinrich Schliemann attempted to locate Alexander's tomb within the Nabi Daniel Mosque, but he was denied permission to excavate.\n\nIn 1993 Triandafyllos Papazois developed the theory that it is not Philip II of Macedon who is buried in the royal tomb II at Vergina, Greece, but it is Alexander the Great together with his wife Roxanne, while his son Alexander IV is buried in tomb III. Also based on the ancient historical sources he came to the conclusion that the breastplate, the shield, the helmet and the sword found in tomb II, belong to the armor of Alexander the Great.\n\nIn 1995 Greek archaeologist Liana Souvaltzi announced she identified one alleged tomb in Siwah with that of Alexander. The claim was put in doubt by the then-general secretary of the Greek Ministry of Culture, George Thomas, who said that it was unclear if the excavated structure is even a tomb. Thomas and members of his team said that the style of the excavated object was not, as Souvaltzi contended, Macedonian, and that the fragments of tablets they were shown did not support any of the translations provided by Souvaltzi as proof of her finding.\n\nAccording to one legend, the body lies in a crypt beneath an early Christian church.\n\nThe 2014 discovery of a large Alexander-era tomb at Kasta Tomb in Amphipolis in the region of Macedonia, Greece, has once again invited speculation about Alexander's final resting place. Some have speculated that it was built for Alexander but never used due to Ptolemy I Soter having seized the funeral cortege. They suggest that the Roman Emperor Caracalla, a great admirer of Alexander, may have had him re-interred in Amphipolis in the late second century AD. However, only future excavation at Amphipolis will reveal if there is any truth in the suggestion. In November 2014, a skeleton was discovered within the tomb, and its full examination is expected to last a few months in order to determine the characteristics of the deceased person in the effort to identify it.\n\nIn a 2011 episode of the National Geographic Channel television series \"Mystery Files,\" Andrew Chugg claimed that Alexander the Great's body was stolen from Alexandria, Egypt, by Venetian merchants who believed it to be that of Saint Mark the Evangelist. They smuggled the remains to Venice, where they were then venerated as Saint Mark the Evangelist in the Basilica Cattedrale Patriarcale di San Marco.\n\n\n\n"}

It is located in the Petén department of northern Guatemala.\n\nUcanal is located inside a bend of the Mopan River. It is accessed via the highway from Flores to Melchor de Mencos, and is near to the village of Tikalito. It is to the south of Tikal.\n\nUcanal was located in a strategic location near the source of the Belize River.\n\nThe ancient name of the Ucanal polity was K'anwitznal, and one of its first rulers was Ajaw K'uk' or Lord Quetzal. The city had strong ties with Tikal and, in the 7th century AD, with Caracol. Ucanal was attacked by the \"Kalomte\" queen-regent, Wac' Chanil Ahau or Lady Six Sky of Naranjo (Saal) in September and December of 693; and on 1 February 695 Ucanal's lord Kinich Cab (\"Shield-Jaguar\") was captured by the ruler of Naranjo. Kinich Cab was held at Naranjo until 22 June 712; Ucanal was reduced to the status of vassal of that city.\n\nIn 800 CE, lord Hok K'awil of Caracol captured the lord of Ucanal. Over the next decades, a Maya-speaking, Nahuat/Maya mestizo people from the Putun filled the power vacuum in Ucanal. These people did not worship the Feathered Serpent Kukulcan. In 830 CE, lord Chan Ek' Hopet installed Wat'ul Chatel as his vassal over Seibal, and commemorated it upon Stele 11 there.\n\nOne of the rulers of Ucanal was Itzamnaaj Bahlam of Ucanal.\n\nThe site has evidence of two artificial irrigation channels one is long and the other is long, both channels are wide. There are 114 structures in the main area and at least 150 residential groups. The protected area covers but does not include all the minor groups. There are several temples and palaces, and 2 ballcourts. Many of the stelae were destroyed by invaders from Naranjo (Saal). There are 22 stelae and 16 altars.\n"}
{"id": "630804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=630804", "title": "V-mail", "text": "V-mail\n\nV-mail, short for Victory Mail, was a hybrid mail process used by the United States during the Second World War as the primary and secure method to correspond with soldiers stationed abroad. To reduce the cost of transferring an original letter through the military postal system, a V-mail letter would be censored, copied to film, and printed back to paper upon arrival at its destination. The V-mail process is based on the earlier British Airgraph process.\n\nV-mail correspondence was on small letter sheets, , that would go through mail censors before being photographed and transported as thumbnail-sized image in negative microfilm. Upon arrival to their destination, the negatives would be printed. The final print was 60% of the original document's size, creating a sheet .\n\nAccording to the National Postal Museum, \"V-mail ensured that thousands of tons of shipping space could be reserved for war materials. The 37 mail bags required to carry 150,000 one-page letters could be replaced by a single mail sack. The weight of that same amount of mail was reduced dramatically from 2,575 pounds to a mere 45.\" This saved considerable weight and bulk in a time in which both were hard to manage in a combat zone.\n\nIn addition to postal censorship, V-mail also deterred espionage communications by foiling the use of invisible ink, microdots, and microprinting, none of which would be reproduced in a photocopy.\n\nThe airgraph was invented in the 1930s by the Eastman Kodak Company in conjunction with Imperial Airways (now British Airways) and Pan-American Airways as a means of reducing the weight and bulk of mail carried by air. The airgraph forms, upon which the letter was written, were photographed and then sent as negatives on rolls of microfilm. A General Post Office (GPO) poster of the time claimed that 1,600 letters on film weighed just 5oz, while 1,600 ordinary letters weighed 50 lbs. At their destination, the negatives were printed on photographic paper and delivered as airgraph letters through the normal Royal Engineers (Postal Section) - also known as the Army Postal Services (APS) - systems.\n\nIn 1940, the British Minister of Transport, Lieutenant Colonel John Moore-Brabazon, 1st Baron Brabazon of Tara, put forward the idea that airgraphs be used to reduce both the bulk and weight of mail travelling between the Middle East Force (MEF) and the UK. The matter was referred to the APS and the GPO, who jointly investigated the possibility of using airgraphs. This eventually led to a service being instituted between England and Egypt in 1941 when 70,000 airgraphs were sent in the first batch and took three weeks to reach their destination.\n\nKodak had offices in Cairo that were capable of processing airgraph negatives, but it was not until the appropriate equipment arrived from America to their Cairo office that the APS was able to provide a return service to the UK.\n\nIn the theatres of war, the whole airgraph operation was coordinated by the APS. Completed airgraph forms were collected by the A/FPOs and forwarded to the Kodak processing plants, which were co-located with the Base APOs.\n\nThe use of the airgraph was not rationed and its postage was also set at three pence (3d). Although the airgraph proved to be immediately popular, its use was limited because of its size (approx; 2ins × 3ins) and lack of privacy, so when sufficient aircraft capacity became available, its use declined in favour of the air letter.\n\nThe airgraph service was later extended to: Canada (1941), East Africa (1941), Burma (1942), India (1942), South Africa (1942), Australia (1943), New Zealand (1943), Ceylon (1944), and Italy (1944).\n\nThe U.S. military's V-mail was based on British Airgraphs, which were based on Eastman Kodak's patent obtained from New York City banker George McCarthy. Prior to that, a similar system was deployed during the Franco-Prussian War which used carrier pigeons to send primitive microfilm strips across German lines, developed from French optician René Dagron's first patent granted for microfilm in 1859. Dagron's microfilm patent was additionally based on British scientist John Benjamin Dancer, who created microfilm in 1839.\n\nThe narrator of \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" takes to going through the trash-basket outside his neighbour Holly Golightly's door:\n\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Curator of the Manchester Museum and Professor of Geology at Owens College, Manchester. He is noted for his research on fossils and the antiquity of man. He was involved in many projects including a tunnel under the Humber, a Channel Tunnel attempt and the proving of coal under Kent.\n\nDawkins was born at Buttington Vicarage in Montgomeryshire on 26 December 1837. He attracted attention at age five by collecting fossils from the local colliery spoil heaps. Soon after, his family moved to Fleetwood in Lancashire, where he attended Rossall School. He again attracted attention by adding fossils from the local boulder clay to his earlier collection. After leaving school, he attended Jesus College, Oxford. He graduated with a second in Classics and a first in Natural Sciences.\n\nOn leaving Oxford University in 1862, he joined the Geological Survey of Great Britain where he spent seven years working on the areas of Kent and the Thames Valley. In 1869, he was elected a member of the Geological Society and appointed Curator of the Manchester Museum, a position he held until 1890. In 1870, he took a further appointment as a lecturer at Owens College, Manchester. eventually becoming the first Professor of Geology in 1874.\n\nDawkins became involved with the Manchester Geological and Mining Society and was its President on three occasions: 1874–75, 1876–77 and 1886–87. He was also President of the Lancashire and Cheshire Antiquarian Society from 1885 to 1887 and again from 1900 to 1902. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1867 and acted as President of the Anthropological Section of the British Association in 1882 and the Geological Section in 1888. He was President of the Cambrian Archaeological Association in 1911–12 and, covering the First World War years, from 1913–1919. Dawkins was knighted for \"services to geology\" in the 1919 Birthday Honours. He died in 1929, aged 91.\n\nDawkins achieved many distinctions in the field of archaeology. In 1859 he moved to Somerset to study classics with the vicar of Wookey. On hearing of the discovery of bones by local workmen he led excavations in the area of the hyena den at Wookey Hole Caves. He also excavated Aveline's Hole, expanding its entrance and naming it after his mentor William Talbot Aveline. His work led to the discovery of the first evidence for use by Palaeolithic man in the Caves of the Mendip Hills.\n\nHe spent a great deal of time researching in Derbyshire, especially at Creswell Crags and Windy Knoll near Castleton. At Windy Knoll (NGR SK126830), he proved the existence of exotic animals that lived in England prior to the ice ages. With Rooke Pennington and J. Tym, he discovered bones from bison, cave hyena, cave bear and a large cat, possibly a relative of the sabre tooth tiger. The bison bones were more recently dated at 37 300bp (OxA – 4579). Many of the finds are located in the museums of Buxton, Derbyshire and Manchester.\n\nIn 1882, following from his work with the Geological Survey, Dawkins was appointed as the official surveyor by the Channel Tunnel Committee. He made a geological survey of the English and French coasts along the Dover and Calais areas, however the project was abandoned due to lack of money.\n\nIn 1886, the South Eastern Railway Company approached Dawkins asking him if his Channel Tunnel work has shown any coal under Kent. The finding of coal under Kent would have given the company great financial benefits. Together with Henry Willett and the French geologist Pigou, Dawkins presented a paper in 1887 proving the existence of coal under the Cretaceous deposits of Kent.\n\nDawkins was a fighter for workers' rights especially in the coal mining industry. He lobbied hard to get a better education system for miners similar to the ones established in Germany. He donated undisclosed amounts of money to this cause.\n\nAmong his other donations was one to the Manchester Museum. The museum wanted to build an extension and started an appeal. The appeal raised £1015 2s 9d, of which Dawkins donated £500. Later in life he fought for compensation for people whose homes had been affected by subsidence from the salt mines and workings near Northwich, Cheshire.\n\nOn his death in 1929, his widow Lady Boyd Dawkins presented his library of some 400 works to the town of Buxton, Derbyshire. These books, together with other personal items such as a bronze bust, photographs and his Lyell and Prestwich medals, are housed at Buxton Museum and Art Gallery in the Boyd Dawkins Reference Room.
