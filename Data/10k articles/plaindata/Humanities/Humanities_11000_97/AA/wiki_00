By 1984 AVANT had produced thousands of acrylic on paper paintings and plastered them on walls, doors, bus-stops and galleries citywide. Principal artists were Christopher Hart Chambers, David Fried, and Marc Thorne.\n\nAVANT was a group of five young New York artists working collectively who wheat pasted handmade original poster sized works of non-calligraphic art in the streets of NYC. While the members of Avant assert that they began in the winter of 1980, the earliest available press documentation of their street art or art exhibitions is found in the New York Native from June 1982, wherein a later article published in the Villager places their origins at January 1981. By 1984 avant had produced thousands of acrylic on paper paintings and plastered them on walls, doors, bus-stops, galleries and museums citywide, concentrated mostly in lower Manhattan. As a group, they were capable of producing hundreds of individual paintings per week, and deployed them in the streets on a regular basis. They also mounted three-dimensional artworks to street sign poles and commandeered bus stop advertising light boxes, replacing the contents with their own original works of art, then relocking the cabinets. Over 40 exhibitions of AVANT's work were held in New York galleries and nightclubs between 1981 and 1984. Over a typical artist-gallery financial dispute, they actually managed to commandeer a gallery in Soho to open the 1982 September season with a self curated exhibition. Another fresh concept was to start an exhibition in the street that would continue into a gallery. They called this the “Drive-In Show,” which started with a dozen numbered oversized paintings pasted high up on a parking lot wall in Soho, and continued up the block in Gabrielle Bryers Gallery starting with painting number 13.\n\n"}

The construction began under the emperor Trajan in the 2nd century AD and destroyed twice by earthquakes in the 6th and 10th centuries. It is the largest amphitheatre ever built in the Balkan Peninsula with once having a capacity of 20,000 people. \n\nThe amphitheatre is included on the tentative list of Albania for inscribing it as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It was discovered in the late 1966 and has become a popular tourist attraction in the city as well as in the country. \n\nThe amphitheatre was built in the beginning of the 2nd century AD. \nThe amphitheatre was used for performances until the 4th century AD. The earthquake of 345/346 likely damaged the monument and closed the 'ludii gladiatorii'.\nAn early Christian chapel was constructed on the amphitheatre in the second half of the 4th century. The chapel was initially decorated with frescoes; in the 6th century, mosaics were added. A medieval chapel was built in the 13th century, also decorated with frescoes.\nThe amphitheatre was covered over in the 16th century, after the Ottoman occupation, when the wall was built nearby. Marin Barleti described the monument as 'well constructed'.\n\nAbout one third of the site was discovered and excavated in the 1960s by Vangjel Toci; the rest was excavated in the 1980s by Lida Miraj. After excavation the amphitheater slowly deteriorated, as no conservation efforts were undertaken prior to the 2000s, and construction continued to take place around the site.

{"id": "11390534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11390534", "title": "Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)", "text": "Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)\n\nThe Annunciation is an oil painting by the Early Netherlandish master Jan van Eyck, from around 1434-1436. The panel is housed in the National Gallery of Art, in Washington D.C. It was originally on panel but has been transferred to canvas. It is thought that it was the left (inner) wing of a triptych; there has been no sighting of the other wings since before 1817. The annunciation is a highly complex work, whose iconography is still debated by art historians.\n\nThe picture depicts the Annunciation by the Archangel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary that she will bear the son of God (Luke 1:26-38). The inscription shows his words: or \"Hail, full of grace...\". She modestly draws back and responds, or \"Behold the handmaiden of the Lord\". The words appear upside down because they are directed to God and are therefore inscribed with a God's-eye view. The Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit descend to her on seven rays of light from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolizing the Holy Spirit following the same path; \"This is the moment God's plan for salvation is set in motion. Through Christ's human incarnation the old era of the Law is transformed into a new era of Grace\".\n\nThe setting develops this theme. Mary was believed in the Middle Ages to have been a very studious girl who was engaged by the Temple of Jerusalem with other selected maidens to spin new curtains for the Holy of Holies. The book she is reading here is too large to be a lady's Book of Hours; as in other paintings she is engaged in serious study in a part of the Temple (one medieval authority specified that she was reading the Book of Isaiah when Gabriel arrived). The van Eycks were almost the first to use this setting in panel painting, but it appears earlier in illuminated manuscripts, and in an altarpiece of 1397 from the same monastery for which this painting was probably ordered.\n\nThe architecture moves from older, round Romanesque forms above, to (slightly) pointed Gothic arches below, with the higher levels largely in darkness, and the floor level well-lit. The gloom of the Old Covenant is about to be succeeded by the light of the New Covenant. The flat timber roof is in poor repair, with planks out of place. The use of Romanesque architecture to identify Jewish rather than Christian settings is a regular feature of the paintings of van Eyck and his followers, and other paintings show both styles in the same building in a symbolic way. \nThe decoration of the Temple is naturally all derived from the Old Testament, but the subjects shown are those believed in the Middle Ages to prefigure the coming of Christ the Messiah. In the floor tiles David's slaying of Goliath (centre front), foretells Christ's triumph over the devil. Behind this, Samson pulls down the Temple of the Philistines, prefiguring both the Crucifixion and the Last Judgement, according to medieval authorities. To the left, Delilah is cutting Samson's hair (Betrayal of Christ), and behind he slays the Philistines (Christ's triumph over sin). The death of Absalom and possibly that of Abimelech are identified by some art historians, although only tiny sections are visible. Erwin Panofsky, who developed much of this analysis, proposed a scheme for the significance of the astrological symbols in the round border tiles, and other versions have been suggested.\n\nThe rear wall has a single stained glass window, where Jehovah stands, above triple plain-glazed windows below, which perhaps suggest the Christian trinity. On either side of the single window are dim wall-paintings of the \"Finding of Moses\" by Pharaoh's daughter (left, pre-figuring the Annunciation itself), and Moses receiving the Ten Commandments (right, paralleling the New Covenant Christ would bring). Below them are roundels with Isaac and Jacob, for which various symbolic functions have been proposed. The lilies are a traditional attribute of Mary, standing for purity. The empty stool may be an \"empty throne\", a symbol for Christ going back to early Byzantine art.\n\nIt has been suggested that Mary has been given the features of Isabella of Portugal, wife of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, who may well have commissioned the painting from van Eyck, his (part-time) court painter. Mary wears a robe in her usual blue, which is trimmed in ermine, reserved for royalty, which would suit this theory, although the Middle Ages placed great emphasis on Mary's royal descent in any case. As is usual, especially in the North, Mary's features are less attractive than those of Gabriel; being a sexless angel there was considered to be no possibility of his beauty causing inappropriate thoughts in the onlooker. Neither figure has a halo; these were being dispensed with in Early Netherlandish art in the interests of realism - eventually the Italians would follow. Mary's posture is ambiguous; it is not clear if she is standing, kneeling or sitting.\n\nMany writers, including Hand, call the figures over-large compared to the architecture. This is certainly a feature of some of van Eyck's depictions of Mary in a Church setting, with a particular theological meaning. In \"Madonna in the Church\" in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin where this theme is most developed: the figure of Mary is some sixty feet high, filling much of the height of a tall Gothic church. It is not so clear that any effect of this type is intended here; there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. If, for example, the setting were a first floor room, or one giving on to a courtyard, the windows might be lower than is normal in a medieval church. The size of the plain glass roundels does not seem disproportionate with the figures.\n\nAnother of van Eyck's themes, and that of other Early Netherlandish painters, is indicated by the large cope over a dalmatic worn by Gabriel. This would, in a human, mark him as a celebrant or attendant at a High Mass. Mary is facing a table with a book upon it about the right size to be a Gospel Book or Missal, and has her hands raised in a gesture known as the \"expansis manibus\". This is certainly to convey the alarm and uncertainty with which she usually greets the surprising apparition of Gabriel and his news, but is also a gesture used by a priest at certain points of a Mass. The painting has been connected with the \"Golden Mass\" (\"Missa Aurea\"), a liturgical drama, or dramatised Mass, popular in the Netherlands at the time, which included a staging of the Annunciation as the Gospel reading. More generally, this is part of a common theme in Early Netherlandish art where Mary, as intermediary between the faithful and God, is compared to, or seen as, a priest celebrating Mass. Her personal sacrifice of her son is compared to the ritual sacrifice enacted by the priest in the Mass. In a surviving extreme example in the Louvre she is shown clearly wearing vestments and celebrating mass at an altar; more often, as here, the comparison is made more subtly.\n\nNo more has been heard of the rest of the triptych since the mentions below in the Provenance. It would presumably have been an altarpiece, for a side-altar or small chapel. The subjects of the other missing panels remain uncertain; a \"Nativity\" or \"Adoration of the Magi\" are considered most likely for the central panel, at least twice as wide as this one, with a \"Visitation of Mary\" or \"Presentation of Jesus\" on the right-hand wing matching this one. The outer sides of the wings would probably have been painted in some fashion, but if there was a full scene, or even a figure in grisaille on the back of this, it is unlikely it would have been discarded when the painting was transferred to canvas in the 19th century. No doubt the themes of this wing would originally have related to those in the other wings in ways we cannot now guess.\n\nA cleaning in 1998, and examination by modern technical methods such as infrared reflectograms, has revealed much about van Eyck's technique here, which is consistent with other works of his such as the Arnolfini Portrait. His underdrawing has been revealed, and so have many changes made in the course of painting the work.\n\nVan Eyck's superb oil painting technique is evident throughout. Gold leaf is only used for the seven rays coming in from the left; paint is used for all the gold on Gabriel, often worked wet-on-wet to achieve the textural effects of his brocaded clothes. In a shadowy area behind the stool van Eyck worked a glaze with his fingers. The play of light over the many different textures in the painting is brilliantly rendered, and the illusionistic detail, especially in Gabriel's rich costume, is exceptional.\n\nApart from several small changes in the position of hands and faces, the under-drawing shows that the small pilasters on the left wall were originally planned to be repeated on the rear wall, and to be much taller, reaching nearly to the roof, on both. The paint on the rear wall is thicker than on the left wall, so he may have painted the pilasters before changing his mind. In the underdrawing the ceiling planks are all in place, and there was also a light source to the right, for which the shadows are drawn.\n\nThe narrative scenes on the tiles replace a simpler decorative plan in the underdrawing, and the stool has become much larger. The vase of lilies was not only absent in the underdrawing, but was not reserved, that is to say that a space was not left for it in the paint for the Virgin's robe or the floor. This suggests it was only added late in the course of painting.\n\nExamination of other major van Eyck works reveals similar developments from the underdrawing, and in the course of painting, in these works. It seems van Eyck, perhaps acting with clerical advisers, although he appears to have been a considerable reader himself, liked to add further complexity to his compositions in the course of work on them.\n\nThe painting was transferred from panel to canvas in the 19th century. It received a major cleaning in 1998, when varnish and some overpaint was removed, and a technical study undertaken. Writing before this, the NGA catalogue described the painting as extensively restored. Craquelure (fine cracking to the surface) had been painted over, especially in the background. Repainted areas included parts of Gabriel's face and hair, and the Virgin's robe, which appeared to have also lost a layer of glaze.\n\nThe range of dates given for the painting was previously from 1428-29 (Panofsky and others) to 1436-37, but the discovery in 1959 of a date of 1437 on an altarpiece in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden has considerably changed all van Eyck dating, and \"makes it all but impossible to continue dating the \"Annunciation\" before 1432\" (Hand). The painting appears stylistically to come between the Ghent Altarpiece and late works such as the Berlin \"Virgin in a church\".\n\nTwo authorities have considered the painting to belong to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck, who died in 1426. It is thought that the recent cleaning or technical investigation has tended to confirm the majority view that it is an autograph work by Jan.\n\nThe provenance of the painting, as far as it is known, is:\n\n\n"}

Beginning in the 1980s, Vergara applied the technique of rephotography to a series of American cities, photographing the same buildings and neighborhoods from the exact vantage point at regular intervals over many years to capture changes over time. Trained as a sociologist with a specialty in urbanism, Vergara turned to his systematic documentation at a moment of urban decay, and he chose locales where that stress seemed highest: the housing projects of Chicago; the South Bronx of New York City; Camden, New Jersey; and Detroit, Michigan, among others.\n\nVergara received a B.A. (1968) in sociology from the University of Notre Dame and an M.A. (1977) in sociology from Columbia University, where he also completed the course work for his Ph.D. (not yet awarded).\n\nVergara began as a humanistic New York street photographer in the early '70s, when he moved to the city. This work changed significantly in the middle 1970s, when graduate work in sociology at Columbia University increasingly sensitized him to the complexities of environmental influences on social behavior.\nThe advent of Kodachrome 64 film in 1974 alerted Vergara to the possibilities of permanent color photographic records of changing urban landscapes and their features.\nHe began at that time to work systematically, using techniques adapted from sociological methodologies; traveling from one subway stop to the next, he would emerge onto the street and then photograph the surrounding blocks, fanning steadily outward.\nBy 1977, he had come upon a rough approximation of his lifelong working method, returning to the same locales over time to photograph changes in the makeup of the communities in question.\n\nWith more than a decade of photographs to document the extraordinary phenomenon of de-urbanization (including the conversion of buildings from one function to a second, then a third, before their abandonment, and the process by which nature recolonized long-urban areas), Vergara published \"The New American Ghetto\" with Rutgers University Press, for which he received the Robert E. Park Award of the American Sociological Association in 1997.\n\nThe advent of sophisticated internet combinations of mapping, visual archiving, and hyperlinking have enabled Vergara to present his work in ways that can combine both the vertical (change over time) and the horizontal (change across space) and link the visual images to texts and databases. Since 2004, Vergara's main work has been conveyed in a website called \"Invincible Cities.\" Upon the news that Google Earth would allow users to compare historical street scenes, Quartz (publication) likened the development to Vergara's website and oeuvre.\n\nHis projects include a continuing series of exhibitions, books, and magazine projects, including a collection of pictures of Chicago's public housing for the new literary magazine Granta. \"Slate\" and \"Time\" magazines have also commissioned him to produce \"mines\" of his work—collections that feature topics or themes, from GM automobiles to distant traces of the World Trade Towers. His eight and most recent book is \"Harlem: The Unmaking of a Ghetto\", published in December 2013 by the University of Chicago Press. The book combines Vergara's early humanistic photographs with his long-running rephotography series of the iconic Manhattan community.\n\nIn 1995, Vergara made a controversial proposal that 12 square blocks of downtown Detroit be declared a \"skyscraper ruins park,\" an \"American acropolis,\" for the preservation and study of the deteriorating and empty skyscrapers:\n\nThe proposal launched a public conservation about representations of the city's built environment and is considered an important statement in the debates surrounding deindustrialization and ruins photography.\n\nIn 2010, Vergara was rewarded a Berlin Prize fellowship and spent the academic spring semester 2010 at the American Academy in Berlin.\n\nOn July 10, 2013, Vergara received the National Humanities Medal from President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House.\n\nOn Friday, May 18, 2018, Vergara was awarded an honorary degree from The New School.\n\nVergara has authored nine published books:\n\n\n"}

The films mainly focus on Chucky (voiced by Brad Dourif), a notorious serial killer known as the \"Lakeshore Strangler\" whose soul is transferred inside a Good Guy doll following a voodoo ritual in order to avoid the afterlife and possibly avoid going to Hell. The original film, \"Child’s Play\", was released on November9, 1988. The film has spawned six sequels and has gone into other media, such as comic books, a video game, tie-in merchandise, and an upcoming television show. The first, second, and fourth films were box office successes with all of the films earning over $182 million worldwide. Including revenues from sales of videos, DVDs, VOD and merchandise, the franchise has generated over $250 million. It also won a Saturn Award for Best Horror Franchise.\n\nThe film series originally started out as straight horror with the first installment \"Child’s Play\", which appears to have more psychological horror elements, while its successors are straightforward slasher films with elements of dark humor. As the films progressed, they became satirical and campy, until the series briefly became a horror comedy, with 1998's \"Bride of Chucky\" and 2004's \"Seed of Chucky\". In 2012, it was confirmed that a new film would be made under the title \"Curse of Chucky\" and be released direct-to-video. Unlike \"Bride\" and \"Seed\", \"Curse of Chucky\" is a full-fledged horror film much like the original three installments. However, it does maintain the campy humor to a small degree. Since \"Bride of Chucky\", titles have no longer been released under the \"Child's Play\" brand name and now use \"Chucky\" and will continue to do so with future films. The latest installment to the series, titled \"Cult of Chucky\", was released on October3, 2017.\n\nSeveral short films have been made featuring the Chucky character: on the DVD release of \"Seed of Chucky\", a short film entitled \"Chucky's Vacation Slides\", set during the events of the film, was included, and a series of short films inserting Chucky into the events of other horror films entitled \"Chucky Invades\" was released in the run-up to the release of \"Curse of Chucky\". On television, Chucky has appeared in commercials and also on \"Saturday Night Live\", with a separate voice actor voicing the character. Chucky appeared in a pretaped segment during an October 1998 episode of World Championship Wrestling's \"Monday Nitro\" program as a heel, taunting wrestler Rick Steiner who was a face at the time and promoting \"Bride of Chucky\".\n\n\"Child’s Play\" is the first and only in the series to be distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists (until \"Seed of Chucky\" which is distributed by Rogue) before the franchise was sold by Universal Pictures. The film is directed by Tom Holland, written by Holland, John Lafia, and Don Mancini, and starring Catherine Hicks, Chris Sarandon, Alex Vincent, and Brad Dourif. The film was released on November 9, 1988. Set in 1988, a serial killer and voodoo practitioner named Charles Lee \"Chucky\" Ray is mortally wounded and transfers his soul via a voodoo ritual into a child-sized \"Good Guy\" doll. The doll is found by a homeless peddler and sold to Karen Barclay, who gives it to her son Andy as a birthday gift. As time goes on Chucky has to get his soul out of the doll before it turns human and the transfer becomes permanent, and thus has to possess the first person he told his secret to - Andy. Desperate to leave his doll body, Chucky terrorizes the Barclays in order to restore his soul.\n\n\"Child’s Play 2\" is the second film in the series and the first film distributed by Universal Pictures. The film is directed by John Lafia, written by Mancini, Vincent and Dourif reprise their roles as Andy Barclay and the voice of Chucky. The film was released on November 9, 1990. The movie takes place in 1990, two years after the events of the first film. While Andy is living in foster care, the doll's manufacturer has taken a positive corporate stance and remade it to prove there is nothing wrong with the Good Guy brand. After a freak electrical malfunction brings Chucky back to life in a new Good Guy doll, he continues to follow Andy in order to transfer his soul from his doll body before it will once again becomes his permanent form.\n\n\"Child's Play 3\", also known as \"Child’s Play 3: Look Who’s Stalking!\", is the third film in the series, and the last film to be titled as \"Child's Play\", before the title change as \"Chucky\". The film is directed by Jack Bender, written by Mancini, and had Dourif reprise once again his role as Chucky, Alex Vincent replaced as Andy Barclay by Justin Whalin as an older version of Andy and a supporting cast of Perrey Reeves and Jeremy Sylvers. The film was released on August 20, 1991. Set in 1998, eight years after the events of the second film, the Good Guy factory has re-opened after the negative publicity, and as Chucky's remains are removed, some blood from his destroyed human-doll body drips into a vat of melted plastic used to re-mould the Good Guy line. Chucky returns in a new body, going on a hunt for the now 16-year-old Andy Barclay, who has left to attend a military academy after the results of the first two films. While attempting to reach Andy, Chucky finds a new boy, Ronald Tyler, who he shares his \"secret\" with. With a new \"Good Guy\" doll body brings the possibility of possessing a new human body, Chucky attempts to restore his soul to human form through Tyler as Andy attempts to stop the killer Good Guy doll once and for all.\n\nThe film picks up a month after the events of \"Child's Play 3\". Unlike the first three films, this film focuses entirely on Chucky and Tiffany. Charles Lee Ray's former girlfriend and his accomplice, Tiffany, acquires Chucky's remains, stitches them together and via a voodoo ritual revives Charles Lee Ray, albeit in a much different form. Chucky kills Tiffany, transferring her soul into a bride doll, and the two maniacs force a young couple to bring them to Ray's grave, where Chucky plans to use a voodoo amulet to finally get a new body. In the end, the Tiffany doll gives birth to a new form of life (Glen/Glenda) as it flies out of a now dead Tiffany and attacks a detective. No one knows whether the detective is dead or alive as the screen cuts to black and closing credits roll.\n\n\"Seed of Chucky\" is the fifth installment, and the first film other than the original \"Child's Play\" not to be distributed by Universal Pictures. Chucky and Tiffany's child Glen finds his parents six years later, in 2004, and brings them back to life, but is horrified by their murders. Chucky and Tiffany force a pregnancy on actress Jennifer Tilly, which is accelerated by voodoo magic. Glen suffers a split personality disorder, having both a male and female soul in his/her body, and dismembers his father. Tiffany uses the ritual to take over Tilly's body and as Tilly bears twins, Glen's dual personality now has a body each of its own. In an epilogue set five years later, in 2009, one of Chucky's severed arms is mailed to the home of his family, where it attacks the now-human Glen.\n\n\"Curse of Chucky\" is the first direct-to-video film in the series. In 2013, Nine years after the events of the fifth film and four years after its epilogue, Chucky is delivered to the family home of Nica and Sarah Pierce, where Chucky terrorizes and kills the family one by one. Chucky is driven by revenge, as Sarah was the one who called the police on him while he was still human, leading to his original death in the first film by detective Mike Norris. Nica survives, but is institutionalized, and blamed for the murders. Chucky is collected by Tiffany, who delivers him to Alice. Chucky successfully transfers his soul into Alice's body which will be explained in Cult of Chucky, as he does the soul ritual the camera moves to reveal Alice's grandmother emerging from the basement, with a plastic bag around her head, slowly dying. Six months later, Chucky is mailed to his next victim, who just so happens to be none other than his longtime original nemesis from the original first three films, Andy Barclay, who points a shotgun at Chucky and shoots him through the head.\n\nIn 2017, Four years after \"Curse of Chucky\", Chucky returns to terrorize Nica at the mental institution where she is admitted. Chucky goes on yet another murderous rampage, killing disbelieved employees & tenants at the institution with various dramatic tricks. When a now vigilante Andy Barclay figures out Chucky's plan, he breaks into the institution in an attempt to disarm his newly created voodoo plot. But in the end, Nica ends up being possessed by Chucky, which causes her to gain the ability to walk and leaves with Tiffany.\n\nIn July 2018, \"Collider\" reported that a modern-day version of \"Child's Play\", a reboot, is in development at MGM without the involvement of Mancini or Kirschner. Lars Klevberg will direct the film, with a script from Tyler Burton Smith (of \"Polaroid\" and \"Quantum Break\" fame, respectively). David Katzenberg and Seth Grahame-Smith will serve as producers. The plot will reportedly feature a group of kids, similar to \"Stranger Things\", and a hi-tech version of the Good Guy Doll. Production will begin in September, later that year.\n\nLater, in September 2018, Gabriel Bateman, Aubrey Plaza and Brian Tyree Henry were cast as Andy Barclay, and Karen Barclay, and Detective Mike Norris, respectively.\n\nIn October 2017, Don Mancini stated that he intends in having Glen and Glenda from \"Seed of Chucky\" return in a future film, and acknowledged that most references to that character had been cut from \"Cult of Chucky\". In February 2018, it was announced that a \"Child's Play\" television series will be a continuation of the film's story arc. Mancini also stated that following the TV show, feature films will continue to be developed in the future.\n\nIn an interview with \"Bloody Disgusting\" Mancini discussed the potential of a \"Child's Play\" film set on a train as well as revealing plans for a crossover film with the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" franchise, tentatively referred to as \"Child’s Play on Elm Street\".<br>\n\nI would like to do Freddy and Chucky, just because I think they would be a fun double act,\" he explains. \"I’m more really interested in the characters. My pitch for Freddy vs. Chucky is Child’s Play on Elm Street. Chucky ends up in some kid’s house on Elm Street, and Chucky and Freddy inevitably meet in the dreamscape. Chucky sleeps. Why not? Chucky sleeps, Chucky dreams. And they have this admiration for each other. But they realize quickly that Elm Street isn’t big enough for the two of them, so in a riff on Dirty Rotten Scoundrels they have a contest: who can kill the most teenagers before the sun comes up? \n\nIn September 2017 in a separate interview with Cinema Blend, Mancini confirmed his intent to make the crossover film, describing it as \"cool and doable\", confirming that the film would be titled \"Child’s Play on Elm Street\" and that he was currently in discussion with New Line Cinema about the film. The foundation for a crossover film was previously laid in \"Bride of Chucky\", in which Freddy Krueger's bladed glove had appeared in the Lockport police evidence depository at the beginning of the film.\n\nIn February 2018, it was announced that a television series titled \"Child's Play: The TV Series\", is in development with involvement from franchise creator Don Mancini, and producer David Kirschner. The show will share continuity with the original film series, and be a continuation of that story. Mancini stated that besides the TV series, feature films will still continue to be developed. By June of the same year, it was confirmed that Brad Dourif would return for the 8-part series to voice Charles Lee \"Chucky\" Ray.\n\nOn the home media DVD and Blu-ray release of \"Seed of Chucky\" in 2005, a short film entitled \"Chucky's Vacation Slides\" was included in the special features. The short, set during the events of \"Seed of Chucky\", follows Chucky, Tiffany, and Glen after having returned from a family vacation. The film implies that the events of \"Seed of Chucky\" take place over the course of 5–10 years. While browsing through their photographs of their vacation on a slide projector, Tiffany notices various corpses in the background of certain photographs, realizing that Chucky has been killing people again. Tiffany leaves, with a distraught and sickened Glen, while Chucky continues to view the photographs. After a delivery man arrives with a pizza, Chucky leads him to his garage and kills him off-screen. Brad Dourif, Jennifer Tilly and Billy Boyd all reprise their roles from the films.\n\nLeading up to the DVD release of \"Curse of Chucky\" in 2013, a series of short film videos were released. The clips showed Chucky interrupting the events of several other horror films. Brad Dourif and Edan Gross reprised their roles as Chucky and the Good Guy Doll, respectively. \n\n\n\nJoe Renzetti composed the first \"Child’s Play\", followed by Graeme Revell, who composed the soundtrack for \"Child’s Play 2\" and \"Bride of Chucky\". John D'Andrea and Cory Lerios wrote the score for \"Child’s Play 3\", while Pino Donaggio composed \"Seed of Chucky\". Joseph LoDuca composed the score for \"Curse of Chucky\" and \"Cult of Chucky\".\n\nThe following crimes have been associated with the \"Child’s Play\" films:\n\nIn December 1992 four people who tortured and killed 16-year-old Suzanne Capper were said to be influenced by one of the \"Child's Play\" movies. During the torturing of the girl, the perpetrators taunted her by playing her a song, (\"Hi, I'm Chucky (Wanna Play?)\" by 150 Volts, featuring samples from the movie \"Child's Play\".\n\nIn 1993, two youths who abducted and murdered a toddler named James Bulger were said to have been influenced by the film \"Child’s Play 3\". The supposed link between the murder and the film was denied by film censor James Ferman.\n\nAccording to a relative of two boys aged 10 and 12 who brutally attacked a nine-year-old and 11-year-old boy in Edlington, South Yorkshire in April 2009, the attackers watched horror movies, including \"Chucky\" films, from the age of about six or seven. Elena Lobacheva, a Russian serial killer arrested in 2015, was reportedly obsessed with the film \"Bride of Chucky\", which she cited as being an inspiration for the murders that she and her gang committed throughout Moscow.\n\nBeginning in 1992, Innovation Publishing released the first comic books based on the films, in the form of a three-issue adaptation of \"Child’s Play 2\". It was later collected in a trade paperback. The success of the adaptation led to a monthly series of new stories starting in 1991. The series, titled \"Child’s Play: The Series\", ended in 1992 after only five issues. This was followed by a three-issue adaptation of \"Child’s Play 3\".\n\nIn 2007, Devil's Due Publishing obtained the license to publish \"Child's Play\" comics and released a one-shot crossover with Hack/Slash titled \"Hack/Slash vs. Chucky\" which takes place after the events of the \"Seed of Chucky\" film. This was followed by a four-issue series called \"Chucky\". A second volume began in early 2009 but ceased publication after only one issue.\n\nSlimstown Studios announced an endless runner video game titled \"Chucky: Slash & Dash\". The game is scheduled to be released on iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch and Android devices. It is the result of an agreement with Universal Partnerships & Licensing to develop and publish the first officially licensed smartphone and tablet \"Child’s Play\" video game. The gameplay is actually inspired by the second film's climax.\n\nIn the game, Chucky is stuck in a never-ending nightmare in which he's endlessly running through the factory that produces Good Guys dolls. Players control Chucky while sprinting through the factory floor, the catwalks, the warehouse, or even outside, and need to avoid conveyor belts, forklifts, acid pools, barrels and other obstacles. Chucky can also eliminate security guards patrolling the factory using his classic knife or other more outlandish weapons like a cleaver, screwdriver, or hatchet. As they play, gamers collect batteries that can be used to purchase in-game items or power-ups, such as a double battery bonus, a fast start, or extra lives that can extend a run after dying.\n\nThe app was released on November 1, 2013.\n\nSince 1992, Chucky has starred in his own shows at Universal Studios \"Halloween Horror Nights\", entitled, \"Chucky's In-Your-Face Insults\" and \"Chucky's Insult Emporium\".\n\nIn 2009, the climax of \"Child’s Play 3\" received its own maze, entitled \"Chucky's Fun House\". \"Curse of Chucky\" has also received its own scarezone in the 2013 lineup.\n\nIn 2017, Chucky played host to the Titans of Terror Tram which featured iconic horror villains Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, and Jason Voorhees.\n\n"}

{"id": "45560521", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45560521", "title": "Conservation and restoration of wooden furniture", "text": "Conservation and restoration of wooden furniture\n\nThe conservation and restoration of wooden furniture is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of wooden furniture objects of historical and personal value. When applied to cultural heritage this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer. Furniture conservation and restoration can be divided into two general areas: structure and finish. Structure generally relates to wood and can be divided into solid, joined, and veneered wood. The finish of furniture can be painted or transparent.\n\nFurniture has existed throughout all the years of human existence. Furniture that is very dated or is an antique can be conserved or restored so that future generations may also enjoy them for cultural, educational and personal benefit. There are many organizations and guidebooks that can be used to understand the techniques that are used to conserve and restore furniture.\n\nThe conservation of furniture is the synthesis of three major endeavors, according to the Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute:\nPreventive conservation is the form of conservation recognized here with furniture care. The American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works declares that stripping and refinishing furniture is no longer standard practice. An early finish is as important to historic furniture as are any of the other original elements. The finish coating offers important data to researchers and is part of the history of the object and once it is removed, it cannot be recovered. The removal and replacement of a surface finish is considered a last ditch effort after other conservation methods have failed.\n\nIn France, conservators specialized in furniture are trained at the Institut National du Patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration. \n\nAntiques restoration can be an arduous process if the goal is total and complete authenticity. For conservators, authentic material is the actual original material of the object. For example: A chair with its original upholstery, even if it is faded and shredded, is authentic for the conservator and possesses historic value even though it may not be exhibitable. The same chair can be \"restored\" and looking as it did when new, with replacement fabric copied from the original weave and colors, and upholstered according to the known design of that particular piece of furniture; this would represent the other kind of authenticity.\n\nFurniture can be divided into periods dominated by the use of a particular wood.\n\nFurniture can consist of many different, and extra, components:\n\nDusting upholstered furniture can be achieved by placing a soft screen on the surface and using a brush attachment on a HEPA vacuum with gentle suction. For further cleaning of upholstered furniture, such as stains, this may most likely require a textile conservator, in addition to a conservator with knowledge of wooden furniture.\n\nWhen a conservator-restorer is working on upholstered furniture it is important for them to consider innovative approaches to reversibility, the maximum preservation of information, and the use of chemically stable materials. Treatments can produce objects that \"appear\" indistinguishable from furniture upholstered in traditional ways, but the actual means of attachment does not include any nails or staples that pierce wood. Velcro makes it possible to examine the carcass of the furniture without undoing any part of the treatment. When furniture is treated using these techniques, stuffing is typically replaced by Ethafoam carved to the appropriate shape. The resulting object has a seat that looks like the original one, but is not \"sittable.\"\n\nAmerican furniture from the mid-nineteenth century probably received new upholstery about every thirty years. Sometimes new fabric was placed on top of the old, and at other times worn upholstery was entirely removed before the new covering was applied. Conservator-restorers can sometimes find threads of original fiber evidence on the chair frame, usually around tack holes. This can guide them to the creation of a reproduction of the original upholstery if an original fabric is not available.\n\nThe Victoria and Albert Museum has a case study on their website on the description of the conservation treatment that was carried out on Marie Antoinette's chair in preparation for its display in the new Europe galleries due to open later in 2015. The chair was made in 1788 by Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748–1803). The chair has been re-upholstered several times, re-gilded and over-painted. The last intervention was in the 1970s when it was upholstered in blue swagged fabric and partially painted a greyish blue.\n\nA synthetic varnish, cellulose nitrate, was developed in the 1850s but was not available in a formulation suitable for commercial furniture until the late 1920s. Unfortunately, cellulose nitrate discolors and becomes brittle as it ages, so over time, the coating on furniture can turn yellow and opaque. It can also crisscross in some places by a fine network of cracks or the varnish can fall off completely. The early date and rarity of this original coating makes it important to retain the varnish on furniture despite these problems.\n\nIn a case study of an armoire with this condition from the 1930s from The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts:\n\"Conservators used a more stable synthetic resin, a type of acrylic copolymer dissolved in a solvent, to consolidate weakened areas of the original varnish without significantly changing the glossiness of its finish or its color. To provide a consistent overall finish, they tinted a portion of that solution the same color as the aged cellulose nitrate to fill some of the more jarring losses. In the future, the new varnish will not be easy to remove, if it can be removed at all, but the synthetic resin used by the conservators is known to have good aging properties.\" \n\nThe following is a list of Wood Terms to describe conditions, as suggested by \"MRM5: Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition:\"\n\nAlligatoring: Series of hairline cracks in old varnish, creating the appearance of alligator hide.\n\nChecking: Slight gapping between wood cells that creates a checkerboard-like pattern. Found where wood is cut straight across the grain for carving, such as in a ball-and-claw foot.\n\nDry rot: Decay of seasoned timber caused by fungi that consume the cellulose of wood, leaving a soft skeleton that is readily reduced to powder.\n\nShrinkage: A loss of mass or size in response to dry relative humidity conditions.\n\nPreventive conservation is the best form of conservation that you can do for furniture without a scientific conservation degree.\n\nA poorly controlled environment can cause detached veneer, cracks, and flaking paint.\n\nLight easily causes color fading. Light is a major concern for furniture because the stains and color of wood are very susceptible to both natural and artificial light.\n\nTo prevent cracks and veneer cleavage, avoid placing furniture near radiators, heat vents or other areas where temperature and relative humidity (RH) fluctuate widely. A stable relative humidity is particularly important to furniture since rapid changes cause different parts of the object to expand and contract at different rates and to different degrees. If the relative humidity is over 60% fungi, such as molds and mildews, will become rampant on wooden furniture. The recommended range for wooden furniture is 45%–55% RH.\n\nImpacts of change in RH on wooden furniture:\n\n\"Low RH\"\n\n\"High RH\"\n\nFast and constant cycling of RH fluctuations causes the most damage for all of the above to create rapid structural weakening.\n\nA common furniture pest is the powderpost beetle, less than a quarter-inch long, which lays its eggs in small crevices. The insect larvae burrow into the wood, creating networks of tunnels as they eat their way along the grain. As they mature to adults, they bore out of the wood leaving an “exit” or “flight” hole and fly off to lay their eggs, completing the cycle. \"Photo to the right—\"\n\nHere is another case study of an early 19th-century bed with an infestation of woodworms from The Museum of Fine Arts in Boston:\n\n\"To protect the bed from damage and prevent pests from spreading to other works of art, it was critical to treat the new acquisition before it entered the building. Conservators completely sealed the bed in a giant impermeable bag and placed an oxygen scavenger inside. In this case, the scavenger was made of fine iron particles. Iron reacts rapidly with oxygen, binding the gas itself and thereby removing it from the air. With the appropriate amount of scavenger in the sealed environment, the conservators brought the oxygen down from normal air levels of 20 percent to less than 0.1 percent. After about four weeks in containment, all of the bed's woodworms in all life stages suffocated. Then the object could be safely brought into the Museum. No toxic chemicals were involved in the treatment, and the conservators disposed of the spent scavenger safely.\"\n\nPerhaps the greatest cause of damage to furniture is people due to misuse and mishandling, creating physical damage. \"Always\" wear clean cotton gloves and handle objects as little as possible. Check furniture for damage or loose joins before moving it. Remove objects from the surface and then remove drawers, shelves, and doors. Elements that cannot be removed should be secured with soft cloth (cotton) straps.\n\nAs well as structural damage, dents, surface wear, scratches, stains and wax from candles are all evidence of past use. Water splashed from repeated floor washing, or spilt from flower displays damages bare or polished surfaces, most commonly leaving white marks. Cups and glasses leave 'rings' on polished surfaces. Alcohol spilt will remove the polished surface almost instantly.\n\nFor the most part, maintaining furniture simply means keeping it clean, carefully.\n\nFurniture oils are not recommended for maintenance as many of them contain linseed oil or other drying oils, and when used repeatedly will create a gummy, insoluble surface coating that darkens and obscures the grain of the wood. Other furniture polishes contain non-drying oils such as lemon oil, but attract and entrap dirt and grime. Silicone polishes are also not recommended as they leave a film that is difficult to remove and can interfere with future finish treatments.\n\nThe Hammond-Harwood House and City of Bowie Museums Collector’s Corner Workshop Series provides a resource on Furniture Cleaning and Care which addresses the tools and techniques of furniture cleaning. \n\nThe Canadian Conservation Institute recommends that Micro-crystalline wax (a scent- and colour-free white paste wax that is available at specialty tool supply stores) can be used to increase the gloss of the finish, which will make it easier to remove fingerprints. Do this only once a year and only to the surfaces that are handled, being careful to avoid wax build-up around metal fittings.\n\nThe Smithsonian Museum Conservation Institute has a graduate-level course of study Furniture Conservation Training Program that was established in 1986.\n\nWinterthur Museum, Garden and Library sponsors two graduate programs with The University of Delaware. The Winterthur program in American Material Culture, founded in 1952, and the Winterthur-University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation founded in 1974.\n\n\n\nVideo: Winterthur Museum, Care in Handling, Chapter 6, Furniture and Wooden Objects Published on Oct 30, 2013.\nWinterthur Museum's in-house training video demonstrates how to safely handle and work with antique furniture in the museum environment.\n\nUsing a basic keyword search for \"furniture,\" Met Publications on the Metropolitan Museum of Art's website is a very instantaneous resource for ready to read or download publications on furniture.\n\nOne can access The National Park Service Museum Handbook through their website.

Restricted by the modern village of Ancient Corinth, which directly overlies the ancient city, the main focus of School investigations has been on the area surrounding the mid-6th century B.C. Temple of Apollo. This dominating monument has been one of the only features of the site visible since antiquity. Archaeologists such as Bert Hodge Hill, Carl Blegen, William Dinsmoor, Sr., Oscar Broneer, and Rhys Carpenter worked to uncover much of the site before WWII. Since then, under the leadership of directors Henry Robinson (1959-1965), Charles K. Williams II (1965-1997) and Guy D. R. Sanders (1997–present), excavation has clarified the archaeological history of the city. Investigations have revealed remains extending from the Early Neolithic period (6500-5750 B.C.) through to early modern times.\n\nArchaeological work has also been done outside the immediate area of the village center including at the Sanctuary of Demeter and Kore on the slopes of Acrocorinth, in the Potters’ Quarter, at the sites of the Sanctuary of Asklepios and the Kenchreian Gate Basilica. Current investigations focus on the area of the Panayia Field, located to the southeast of the Forum. School excavations and projects affiliated to the ASCSA have also intensively explored the wider area of the Corinthia including the surrounding settlements of Korakou, Kenchreai and Isthmian Games. Finds from these works are housed in the Archaeological Museum of Ancient Corinth.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3453673", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3453673", "title": "Cultural heritage management", "text": "Cultural heritage management\n\nCultural heritage management (CHM) is the vocation and practice of managing cultural heritage. It is a branch of cultural resources management (CRM), although it also draws on the practices of cultural conservation, restoration, museology, archaeology, history and architecture. While the term cultural heritage is generally used in Europe, in the USA the term cultural resources is in more general use specifically referring to cultural \"heritage\" resources. CHM has traditionally been concerned with the identification, interpretation, maintenance, and preservation of significant cultural sites and physical heritage assets, although intangible aspects of heritage, such as traditional skills, cultures and languages are also considered. The subject typically receives most attention, and resources, in the face of threat, where the focus is often upon rescue or salvage archaeology. Possible threats include urban development, large-scale agriculture, mining activity, looting, erosion or unsustainable visitor numbers. The public face of CHM, and a significant source of income to support continued management of heritage, is the interpretation and presentation to the public, where it is an important aspect of tourism. Communicating with government and the public is therefore a key competence.\nCHM has its roots in the rescue archaeology and urban archaeology undertaken throughout North America and Europe in the years surrounding World War II and the succeeding decades. Salvage projects were hasty attempts to identify and rescue archaeological remains before they were destroyed to make room for large public-works projects or other construction. In the early days of salvage archaeology, it was nearly unheard-of for a project to be delayed because of the presence of even the most fascinating cultural sites, so it behooved the salvage archaeologists to work as fast as possible. Although many sites were lost, much data was saved for posterity through these salvage efforts.\n\nIn more recent decades, legislation has been passed that emphasizes the identification and protection of cultural sites, especially those on public lands. In the United States, the most notable of these laws remains the National Historic Preservation Act. The administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson was most instrumental in passing and developing this legislation, although it has been extended and elaborated upon since. These laws make it a crime to develop any federal lands without conducting a cultural resources survey in order to identify and assess any cultural sites that may be affected. In the United Kingdom, PPG 16 has been instrumental in improving the management of historic sites in the face of development.\n\nThe subject has developed from an emphasis on preservation of material culture (by record if not by physical remains), to encompass the broader concepts of culture, which are inseparable from the local communities. Modern thinking takes the view that cultural heritage belongs to the people, therefore access to cultural heritage has to be ensured. The public reaction to the proposed destruction of the Newport ship shows the importance of heritage to local communities.\n\nThe legislation of individual nations is often based upon ratification of UNESCO conventions, such as the 1972 World Heritage Convention, the Valletta treaty and the 2001 Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. Specific legislation is sometimes needed to ensure the appropriate protection of individual sites recognized as World Heritage Sites.\n\nWhile archaeological sites remain the primary focus for many CRM professional, others research historical records or on ethnohistorical projects. Public outreach also falls within their purview. A recent concept is Traditional Cultural Property or TCP. These are places with cultural importance to a group that may not be either particularly historical or an archaeological site. An example would be a location used for contemporary Native American religious events that has no archaeological remains.\n\nA phase of evaluation is considered important in assessing the significance of a possible cultural heritage site. This can comprise a desk-based study, interviews with informants in the community, a wide-area survey, or trial trenching. In North America, survey normally includes either walking ploughed fields in 5–10-metre transects or digging shovel test pits at the same intervals. The soil from the test pits is sifted through 6 mm mesh to look for artifacts. If artifacts are found, the next stage of investigation is usually digging and sifting a spaced grid of test pits (1 m by 1 m trenches) to determine how large or significant the site is.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Canada, all forms of development, public and private, are subject to archaeological requirements, while in the United States this work can only be undertaken in federally funded projects or those on government-owned land, except in a few states that have laws that apply also to private land.\n\nWhere archaeological requirements apply to a site of proposed development, if no significant archaeological or other cultural property sites are found in the impacted area, construction may proceed as planned, often with the requirement that archaeologists are on-site providing a watching brief. If potentially significant remains are found, construction may be delayed to allow for evaluation of the site or sites found within the impacted area. This is done to determine the archaeological site's true significance. If archaeologists determine the site contains important/significant cultural remains, the adverse effects on the site must be mitigated. Site mitigation can involve avoiding the site through redesigning the development or excavating only a percentage of the site. In the U.S., these restrictions involve any federal project involving the possible disturbance of cultural resources and can also extend to state and private developments if they involve public waterways or federal funds.\n\nIf archaeologists determine the site contains highly significant cultural remains, the adverse development effects on the site must be mitigated through a structured programme that is often long and expensive. Mitigation can include preservation by record i.e. the site is destroyed by archaeological excavation rather than by the development and meticulous recording transfers the physical traces in the earth to information in archives. Mitigation also includes construction techniques which ensure that archaeological remains are protected in undisturbed parts of the site or even underneath the development. An example of this type of mitigation is the Viking remains at York.\n\nImportant sites are designated as being protected by the state so that no development at all can take place, and governments also recommend the most important sites to be recognised as World Heritage Sites.\n\nCHM has been a mixed blessing for archaeology. Preservation legislation has ensured that no valuable site will be destroyed by construction without study, but the work of rescue archaeologists is sometimes controversial. Some academic archaeologists do not take archaeological rescue or salvage work seriously because of its emphasis on site identification and preservation rather than intensive study and analysis. Where archaeology is motivated by proposed development, the archaeological contracts are placed through a bidding process. The choice of archaeological contractor typically lies with the developer and there is little incentive to prevent the company responsible for construction selecting the bid with the lowest price estimate, or shortest investigation time, regardless of the archaeological merits of the submitted bids.\n\nThe impact of archaeological rescue and salvage work has been considerable; given the large amount of construction, and that the bulk of archaeological work in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom is developer led. Unfortunately, the large number of reports written on the thousands of sites dug each year are not necessarily published in public forums. So-called grey literature is sometimes difficult for even archaeologists outside the developer or the CRM organisation that performed the work to access. Some initiatives, notably the OASIS project of the Archaeological Data Service in the UK, are beginning to make the reports available to everyone.\n\nCuration refers to the long-term preservation and retention of heritage assets and to providing access to them in a variety of forms. Fragile heritage assets may need to be preserved in a special environment, and protected from light (especially ultra-violet), humidity, fluctations in temperature and in some cases, oxygen from the air. Large museums generally employ specialist conservators as well as education officers, archivists and researchers. \n\nMuseums vary in their approach to interpretation ranging from traditional museums that display collections of artefacts behind glass, with labels identifying each item and giving provenance, to living museums which attempt to recreate a historical place or period so that people can experience it. \n\nWithin a single museum, a range of approaches may be used including interpretative panels, presenting artefacts in a realistic setting as they would have been experienced, and creating interactive and virtual exhibits. Museums also have processes to loan artefacts to other institutions or exhibitions. Interpretative panels, and other signage, such as Blue plaques in the UK are important in ensuring that cultural heritage is understood in the context of the local community.\n\nPreservation and restoration usually refers to architectural or engineering heritage assets such as heritage buildings or other structures and Heritage railways. The UK has a number of different forms of protection for buildings and structures, including listed buildings, conservation areas and Scheduled Ancient Monuments. In France a building or other structure can be protected as a Monument historique. Successful heritage management for a building generally requires that the building continues to be used, as disused buildings are likely to deteriorate quickly. If the purpose for which the building was originally constructed is no longer viable, then other uses, often requiring sympathetic modification must be found.\n\nHeritage machinery, such as antique or vintage cars and heritage railways can best be understood and are best accessed and experienced by the public when they are in an operational condition. Moreover, the heritage skills associated with such heritage assets, such as driving a steam locomotive, can only be maintained if the machinery is used. Restoration to a working, if not pristine condition, and creation of exact working replicas are therefore part of the practice of heritage management.\n\nThe intangible cultural heritage consists of traditional skills, beliefs, traditions, oral traditions, music, songs, dance, drama etc. These cannot be stored in a museum but are constantly reinterpreted by the people in a particular cultural region. The management of intangible cultural heritage is difficult as it requires consideration of the lives and living conditions of local communities. Some countries such as India and the members of the African union have recognised the importance of cultural resources and established government departments to manage them.\n\n\n\n"}

It flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the Consulate and the First French Empire periods, although its life span lasted until the late-1820s. From France it spread into much of Europe and the United States. \n\nThe style originated in and takes its name from the rule of the Emperor Napoleon I in the First French Empire, when it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The previous fashionable style in France had been the Directoire style, a more austere and minimalist form of Neoclassicism, that replaced the Louis XVI style. The Empire style brought a full return to ostentatious richness. The style corresponds somewhat to the Biedermeier style in the German-speaking lands, Federal style in the United States, and the Regency style in Britain. \n\nThe style developed and elaborated the Directoire style of the immediately preceding period, which aimed at a simpler, but still elegant evocation of the virtues of the Ancient Roman Republic:\n\nThe stoic virtues of Republican Rome were upheld as standards not merely for the arts but also for political behaviour and private morality. \"Conventionels\" saw themselves as antique heroes. Children were named after Brutus, Solon and Lycurgus. The festivals of the Revolution were staged by David as antique rituals. Even the chairs in which the committee of \"Salut Publique\" sat were made on antique models devised by David. ...In fact Neo-classicism became fashionable.\n\nThe Empire style \"turned to the florid opulence of Imperial Rome. The abstemious severity of Doric was replaced by Corinthian richness and splendour\".\n\nTwo French architects, Charles Percier and Pierre Fontaine, were together the creators of the French Empire style. The two had studied in Rome and in the 1790s became leading furniture designers in Paris, where they received many commissions from Napoleon and other statesmen.\n\nArchitecture of the Empire style was based on elements of the Roman Empire and its many archaeological treasures, which had been rediscovered starting in the eighteenth century. The preceding Louis XVI and Directoire styles employed straighter, simpler designs compared to the Rococo style of the eighteenth century. Empire designs strongly influenced the contemporary American Federal style (such as design of the United States Capitol building), and both were forms of propaganda through architecture. It was a style of the people, not ostentatious but sober and evenly balanced. The style was considered to have \"liberated\" and \"enlightened\" architecture just as Napoleon \"liberated\" the peoples of Europe with his Napoleonic Code.\n\nThe Empire period was popularized by the inventive designs of Percier and Fontaine, Napoleon's architects for Malmaison. The designs drew for inspiration on symbols and ornaments borrowed from the glorious ancient Greek and Roman empires. Buildings typically had simple timber frames and box-like constructions, veneered in expensive mahogany imported from the colonies. Biedermeier furniture also used ebony details, originally due to financial constraints. Ormolu details (gilded bronze furniture mounts and embellishments) displayed a high level of craftsmanship.\n\nGeneral Bernadotte, later to become King Karl Johan of Sweden and Norway, introduced the Napoleonic style to Sweden, where it became known under his own name. The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared from other parts of Europe. France paid some of its debts to Sweden in ormolu bronzes instead of money, leading to a vogue for crystal chandeliers with bronze from France and crystal from Sweden.\n\nAfter Napoleon lost power, the Empire style continued to be in favour for many decades, with minor adaptations. There was a revival of the style in the last half of the nineteenth century in France, again at the beginning of the twentieth century, and again in the 1980s.\n\nThe most famous Empire-style structures in France are the grand neoclassical Arc de Triomphe of Place de l'Étoile, Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel, Vendôme column, and La Madeleine, which were built in Paris to emulate the edifices of the Roman Empire. The style also was used widely in Imperial Russia, where it was used to celebrate the victory over Napoleon in such memorial structures as the General Staff Building, Kazan Cathedral, Alexander Column, and Narva Triumphal Gate. Stalinist architecture is sometimes referred to as Stalin's Empire style.\n\nThe style survived in Italy longer than in most of Europe, partly because of its Imperial Roman associations, partly because it was revived as a national style of architecture following the unification of Italy in 1870. Mario Praz wrote about this style as the Italian Empire. In the United Kingdom, Germany, and the United States, the Empire style was adapted to local conditions and gradually acquired further expression as the Egyptian Revival, Greek Revival, Biedermeier style, Regency style, and late-Federal style.\n\n\n"}

The term was coined during the late nineteenth century as European powers indulged in the 'Scramble for Africa' in the name of national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during the 20th century including Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany, the Japanese empire, and the Balkans countries of Albania (Greater Albania), Bulgaria (Greater Bulgaria), Croatia (Greater Croatia), Hungary (Greater Hungary), Romania (Greater Romania) and Serbia (Greater Serbia).\n\nWhat distinguishes expansionist nationalism from liberal nationalism is its acceptance of chauvinism, a belief in superiority or dominance. Nations are thus not thought to be equal to their right to self-determination; rather some nations are believed to possess characteristics or qualities that make them superior to others. Expansionist nationalism therefore asserts the state's right to increase its borders at the expense of its neighbours.\n\n"}

{"id": "238285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=238285", "title": "Frank P. Ramsey", "text": "Frank P. Ramsey\n\nFrank Plumpton Ramsey (; 22 February 1903 – 19 January 1930) was a British philosopher, mathematician and economist who made fundamental contributions to abstract algebra before his death at the age of 26. He was a close friend of Ludwig Wittgenstein and was instrumental in translating Wittgenstein's \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" into English, as well as persuading Wittgenstein to return to philosophy and Cambridge. Like Wittgenstein, he was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, the intellectual secret society, from 1921.\n\nRamsey was born on 22 February 1903 in Cambridge where his father Arthur Stanley Ramsey (1867–1954), also a mathematician, was President of Magdalene College. His mother was Mary Agnes Stanley (1875–1927). He was the eldest of two brothers and two sisters, and his brother Michael Ramsey, the only one of the four siblings who was to remain Christian, later became Archbishop of Canterbury. He entered Winchester College in 1915 and later returned to Cambridge to study mathematics at Trinity College. While studying mathematics at Trinity College, Ramsey became a student to John Maynard Keynes, and an active member in the Apostles, a Cambridge discussion group. In 1923, he received his bachelor's degree in mathematics, passing his examinations with the result of first class with distinction. He was named Senior Wrangler. Easy-going, simple and modest, Ramsey had many interests besides his scientific work. Even as a teenager Ramsey exhibited both a profound ability and, as attested by his brother, an extremely diverse range of interests:\n\nIn 1923, Ramsey was befriended by Geoffrey and Margaret Pyke, then on the point of founding the Malting House School in Cambridge; the Pykes took Ramsey into their family, taking him on holiday and asking him to be the godfather of their young son. Margaret found herself to be the object of his affection, Ramsey recording in his diary: \n\nOne afternoon I went out alone with her on Lake Orta and became filled with desire and we came back and lay on two beds side by side she reading, I pretending to, but with an awful conflict in my mind. After about an hour I said (she was wearing her horn spectacles and looking superlatively beautiful in the Burne Jones style) ‘Margaret will you fuck with me?’\nMargaret wanted time to consider his proposition and thus began an uncomfortable dance between them, which contributed to Ramsey's depressive moods in early 1924; as a result he travelled to Vienna for psychoanalysis. He, like many of his contemporaries, including his Viennese flatmate and fellow Apostle Lionel Penrose (also in analysis with Siegfried Bernfeld), was intellectually interested in psychoanalysis. Ramsey's analyst was Theodor Reik, a disciple of Freud. As one of the justifications for undertaking the therapy, he asserted in a letter to his mother that unconscious impulses might even affect the work of a mathematician. While in Vienna, he visited Wittgenstein in Puchberg, was befriended by the Wittgenstein family and visited A.S. Neill's experimental school four hours from Vienna at Sonntagsberg. In the summer of 1924, he continued his analysis by joining Reik at Dobbiaco (in South Tyrol), where a fellow analysand was Lewis Namier. Ramsey returned to England in October 1924; with John Maynard Keynes's support he became a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. He joined a Psychoanalysis Group in Cambridge with fellow members Arthur Tansley, Lionel Penrose, Harold Jeffreys, John Rickman and James Strachey, the qualification for membership of which was a completed psychoanalysis.\n\nRamsey married Lettice Baker in September 1925, the wedding taking place in a Register Office since Ramsey was, as his wife described him, a ‘militant atheist'. After Ramsey's death, Lettice Ramsey opened a photography studio in Cambridge with photographer Helen Muspratt. The marriage produced two daughters. Despite his atheism, Ramsey was quite tolerant towards his brother when the latter decided to become a priest in the Church of England.\n\nIn 1926 he became a university lecturer in mathematics and later a Director of Studies in Mathematics at King's College.\nThe Vienna Circle manifesto (1929) lists three of his publications in a bibliography of closely related authors.\n\nWhen I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden, both Fellows of Magdalene, first met Ramsey, he expressed his interest in learning German. According to Richards, he mastered the language \"in almost hardly over a week\", although other sources show he had taken one year of German in school. Ramsey was then able, at the age of 19, to make the first draft of the translation of the German text of Wittgenstein's \"Tractatus Logico Philosophicus\". Ramsey was impressed by Wittgenstein's work and after graduating as Senior Wrangler in the Mathematical Tripos of 1923 he made a journey to Austria to visit Wittgenstein, at that time teaching in a primary school in the small community of Puchberg am Schneeberg. For two weeks Ramsey discussed the difficulties he was facing in understanding the \"Tractatus\". Wittgenstein made some corrections to the English translation in Ramsey's copy and some annotations and changes to the German text that subsequently appeared in the second edition in 1933.\n\nRamsey and John Maynard Keynes cooperated to try to bring Ludwig Wittgenstein back to Cambridge (he had been a student there before World War I). Once Wittgenstein had returned to Cambridge, Ramsey became his nominal supervisor. Wittgenstein submitted the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\" as his doctoral thesis. G.E. Moore and Bertrand Russell acted as examiners. Later, the three of them arranged financial aid for Wittgenstein to help him continue his research work.\n\nIn 1929 Ramsey and Wittgenstein regularly discussed issues in mathematics and philosophy with Piero Sraffa, an Italian economist who had been brought to Cambridge by Keynes after Sraffa had aroused Benito Mussolini's ire by publishing an article critical of the Fascist regime in the \"Manchester Guardian\". The contributions of Ramsey to these conversations were acknowledged by both Sraffa and Wittgenstein in their later work.\n\nSuffering from chronic liver problems, Ramsey developed jaundice after an abdominal operation and died on 19 January 1930 at Guy's Hospital in London at the age of 26.\n\nHe is buried in the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge; his parents are buried in the same plot.\n\nRamsey's notes and manuscripts were acquired by Nicholas Rescher for the Archives of Scientific Philosophy and the University of Pittsburgh. This collection contains only a few letters but a great many drafts of papers and book chapters, some still unpublished. Other papers, including his diary and letters and memoirs by his widow Lettice Ramsey and his father, are held in the Modern Archives, King's College, Cambridge.\n\nThe Decision Analysis Society annually awards the Frank P. Ramsey Medal to recognise substantial contributions to decision theory and its application to important classes of real decision problems.\n\nOne of the theorems proved by Ramsey in his 1928 paper \"On a problem of formal logic\" now bears his name (Ramsey's theorem). While this theorem is the work Ramsey is probably best remembered for, he only proved it in passing, as a minor lemma along the way to his true goal in the paper, solving a special case of the decision problem for first-order logic, namely the decidability of what is now called the Bernays–Schönfinkel–Ramsey class of first-order logic, as well as a characterisation of the spectrum of sentences in this fragment of logic. Alonzo Church would go on to show that the general case of the decision problem for first-order logic is unsolvable (see Church's theorem). A great amount of later work in mathematics was fruitfully developed out of the ostensibly minor lemma, which turned out to be an important early result in combinatorics, supporting the idea that within some sufficiently large systems, however disordered, there must be some order. So fruitful, in fact, was Ramsey's theorem that today there is an entire branch of mathematics, known as Ramsey theory, which is dedicated to studying similar results.\n\nHis philosophical works included \"Universals\" (1925), \"Facts and propositions\" (1927) (which proposed a redundancy theory of truth), \"Universals of law and of fact\" (1928), \"Knowledge\" (1929), \"Theories\" (1929), \"On Truth\" (1929), and \"General propositions and causality\" (1929). Wittgenstein mentions him in the introduction to his \"Philosophical Investigations\" as an influence.\n\nKeynes and Pigou encouraged Ramsey to work on economics as \"From a very early age, about sixteen I think, his precocious mind was intensely interested in economic problems\" (Keynes, 1933). Ramsey responded to Keynes's urging by writing three papers in economic theory all of which were of fundamental importance, though it was many years before they received their proper recognition by the community of economists.\n\nRamsey's three papers, described below in detail, were on subjective probability and utility (1926), optimal allocation (1927) and optimal one-sector economic growth (1928). The economist Paul Samuelson described them in 1970 as \"three great legacies – legacies that were for the most part mere by-products of his major interest in the foundations of mathematics and knowledge.\"\n\nThis significant paper was published in \"The Economic Journal\", and involved \"a strategically beautiful application of the calculus of variations\" (Paul Samuelson) to determine the optimal amount an economy should invest (save) rather than consume so as to maximise future utility, or in Ramsey's words \"how much of its income should a nation save?\" (Ramsey, 1928).\n\nKeynes described the article as \"one of the most remarkable contributions to mathematical economics ever made, both in respect of the intrinsic importance and difficulty of its subject, the power and elegance of the technical methods employed, and the clear purity of illumination with which the writer's mind is felt by the reader to play about its subject. The article is terribly difficult reading for an economist, but it is not difficult to appreciate how scientific and aesthetic qualities are combined in it together.\" The Ramsey model is today acknowledged as the starting point for optimal accumulation theory although its importance was not recognised until many years after its first publication.\n\nThe main contributions of the model were firstly the initial question Ramsey posed on how much savings should be and secondly the method of analysis, the intertemporal maximisation (optimisation) of collective or individual utility by applying techniques of dynamic optimisation. Tjalling C. Koopmans and David Cass modified the Ramsey model incorporating the dynamic features of population growth at a steady rate and of Harrod-neutral technical progress again at a steady rate, giving birth to a model named the Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model where the objective now is to maximise household's utility function.\n\nIn this paper Ramsey's contribution to economic theory was the elegant concept of Ramsey pricing. This is applicable in situations where a (regulated) monopolist wants to maximise consumer surplus whilst at the same time ensuring that its costs are adequately covered. This is achieved by setting the price such that the markup over marginal cost is inversely proportional to the price elasticity of demand for that good. Like its predecessor this paper was published in The Economic Journal in 1927. Ramsey poses the question that is to be solved at the beginning of the article: \"a given revenue is to be raised by proportionate taxes on some or all uses of income, the taxes on different uses being possibly at different rates; how much should these rates be adjusted in order that the decrement of utility may be a minimum?\" (Ramsey 1927). The problem was suggested to him by the economist Arthur Pigou and the paper was Ramsey's answer to the problem.\n\nKeynes in his \"A Treatise on Probability\" (1921) argued against the subjective approach in epistemic probabilities. For Keynes, subjectivity of probabilities doesn't matter as much, as for him there is an objective relationship between knowledge and probabilities, as knowledge is disembodied and not personal.\n\nRamsey in his article disagrees with Keynes's approach as for him there is a difference between the notions of probability in physics and in logic. For Ramsey probability is not related to a disembodied body of knowledge but is related to the knowledge that each individual possesses alone. Thus personal beliefs that are formulated by this individual knowledge govern probabilities, leading to the notions of subjective probability and Bayesian probability. Consequently, subjective probabilities can be inferred by observing actions that reflect individuals' personal beliefs. Ramsey argued that the degree of probability that an individual attaches to a particular outcome can be measured by finding what odds the individual would accept when betting on that outcome.\nRamsey suggested a way of deriving a consistent theory of choice under uncertainty that could isolate beliefs from preferences while still maintaining subjective probabilities.\n\nDespite the fact that Ramsey's work on probabilities was of great importance again no one paid any attention to it until the publication of \"Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\" of John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in 1944 (1947 2nd ed.)\n\nHoward Raiffa was made the first Frank P. Ramsey Professor (of Managerial Economics) at Harvard University. He is now emeritus. Richard Zeckhauser was made the Frank P. Ramsey Professor of Political Economy at Harvard University in 1971. Raiffa's chair was joint between the Harvard Business and Kennedy Schools. Zeckhauser's chair is in the Kennedy School.\nPartha Dasgupta was made Frank Ramsey Professor of Economics in 1994 and Frank Ramsey Professor Emeritus of Economics in 2010 at the University of Cambridge.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12229", "title": "Government", "text": "Government\n\nA government is the system or group of people governing an organized community, often a state.\n\nIn the case of its broad associative definition, government normally consists of legislature, executive, and judiciary. Government is a means by which organizational policies are enforced, as well as a mechanism for determining policy. Each government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy. Typically the philosophy chosen is some balance between the principle of individual freedom and the idea of absolute state authority (tyranny).\n\nWhile all types of organizations have governance, the word \"government\" is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments on Earth, as well as subsidiary organizations.\n\nHistorically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy and tyranny. The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession.\n\nA government is the system to govern a state or community.\n\nThe word \"government\" derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb κυβερνάω [\"kubernáo\"] (meaning \"to steer\" with gubernaculum (rudder), the metaphorical sense being attested in Plato's Ship of State).\n\nThe Columbia Encyclopedia defines government as \"a system of social control under which the right to make laws, and the right to enforce them, is vested in a particular group in society\".\n\nWhile all types of organizations have governance, the word \"government\" is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments on Earth, as well as their subsidiary organizations.\n\nIn the Commonwealth of Nations, the word \"government\" is also used more narrowly to refer to the ministry (collective executive), a collective group of people that exercises executive authority in a state or, metonymically, to the governing cabinet as part of the executive.\n\nFinally, \"government\" is also sometimes used in English as a synonym for governance.\n\nThe moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time; however, history does record the formations of early governments. About 5,000 years ago, the first small city-states appeared. By the third to second millenniums BC, some of these had developed into larger governed areas: Sumer, Ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, and the Yellow River Civilization.\n\nThe development of agriculture and water control projects were a catalyst for the development of governments. For many thousands of years when people were hunter-gatherers and small scale farmers, humans lived in small, non-hierarchical and self-sufficient communities. On occasion a chief of a tribe was elected by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe, sometimes with a group of elder tribesmen as a council. The human ability to precisely communicate abstract, learned information allowed humans to become ever more effective at agriculture, and that allowed for ever increasing population densities. David Christian explains how this resulted in states with laws and governments:\n\nStarting at the end of the 17th century, the prevalence of republican forms of government grew. The Glorious Revolution in England, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution contributed to the growth of representative forms of government. The Soviet Union was the first large country to have a Communist government. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, liberal democracy has become an even more prevalent form of government.\n\nIn the nineteenth and twentieth century, there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level. This included the regulation of corporations and the development of the welfare state.\n\nIn political science, it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of polities, as typologies of political systems are not obvious. It is especially important in the political science fields of comparative politics and international relations. Like all categories discerned within forms of government, the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined.\n\nSuperficially, all governments have an official or ideal form. The United States is a constitutional republic, while the former Soviet Union was a socialist republic. However self-identification is not objective, and as Kopstein and Lichbach argue, defining regimes can be tricky. For example, elections are a defining characteristic of an electoral democracy, but in practice elections in the former Soviet Union were not \"free and fair\" and took place in a one-party state. Voltaire argued that \"the Holy Roman Empire is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire\". Many governments that officially call themselves a \"democratic republic\" are not democratic, nor a republic; they are usually a dictatorship \"de facto\". Communist dictatorships have been especially prone to use this term. For example, the official name of North Vietnam was \"The Democratic Republic of Vietnam\". China uses a variant, \"The People's Republic of China\". Thus in many practical classifications it would not be considered democratic.\n\nIdentifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by parties naming themselves after those movements; all with competing political-ideologies. Experience with those movements in power, and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government, can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.\n\nOther complications include general non-consensus or deliberate \"distortion or bias\" of reasonable technical definitions to political ideologies and associated forms of governing, due to the nature of politics in the modern era. For example: The meaning of \"conservatism\" in the United States has little in common with the way the word's definition is used elsewhere. As Ribuffo notes, \"what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism\". Since the 1950s conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the Republican Party. However, during the era of segregation many Southern Democrats were conservatives, and they played a key role in the Conservative Coalition that controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963.\n\nEvery country in the world is ruled by a system of governance that combines at least three or more political or economic attributes. Additionally, opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist. \"Shades of gray\" are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification. Even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for \"pigeonholing\" governments into narrow categories. Examples include the claims of the United States as being a plutocracy rather than a democracy since some American voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy Super PACs.\n\nThe Classical Greek philosopher Plato discusses five types of regimes: aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny. Plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for. The tyrannical man would represent tyranny for example. These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom.\n\nOne method of classifying governments is through which people have the authority to rule. This can either be one person (an autocracy, such as monarchy), a select group of people (an aristocracy), or the people as a whole (a democracy, such as a republic).\n\nThe division of governments as monarchy, aristocracy and democracy has been used since Aristotle's Politics. In his book Leviathan, Thomas Hobbes expands on this classification.\n\nAn autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection).\n\nA despotism is a government ruled by a single entity with absolute power, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regular mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for implicit threat). That entity may be an individual, as in an autocracy, or it may be a group, as in an oligarchy. The word despotism means to \"rule in the fashion of despots\".\n\nA monarchy is where a family or group of families (rarely another type of group), called the royalty, represents national identity, with power traditionally assigned to one of its individuals, called the monarch, who mostly rule kingdoms. The actual role of the monarch and other members of royalty varies from purely symbolical (crowned republic) to partial and restricted (constitutional monarchy) to completely despotic (absolute monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the post of the monarch is inherited, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected.\n\nAristocracy (Greek ἀριστοκρατία \"aristokratía\", from ἄριστος \"\" \"excellent\", and κράτος \"\" \"power\") is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class.\n\nMany monarchies were aristocracies, although in modern constitutional monarchies the monarch himself or herself has little real power. The term \"Aristocracy\" could also refer to the non-peasant, non-servant, and non-city classes in the Feudal system. \n\nAn oligarchy is ruled by a small group of segregated, powerful or influential people who usually share similar interests or family relations. These people may spread power and elect candidates equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or monarchic. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler but several rulers.\n\nSome historical examples of oligarchy are the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Some critics of representative democracy think of the United States as an oligarchy. The Athenian democracy used sortition to elect candidates, almost always male, Greek, educated citizens holding a minimum of land, wealth and status.\n\nA theocracy is rule by a religious elite; a system of governance composed of religious institutions in which the state and the church are traditionally or constitutionally the same entity. The Vatican's (see Pope), Iran's (see Supreme Leader), Tibetan government's (see Dalai Lama), Caliphates and other Islamic states are historically considered \"theocracies\".\n\nIn a general sense, in a democracy, all the people of a state or polity are involved in making decisions about its affairs. Also refer to the rule by a government chosen by election where most of the populace are enfranchised. The key distinction between a democracy and other forms of constitutional government is usually taken to be that the right to vote is not limited by a person's wealth or race (the main qualification for enfranchisement is usually having reached a certain age). A democratic government is, therefore, one supported (at least at the time of the election) by a majority of the populace (provided the election was held fairly). A \"majority\" may be defined in different ways. There are many \"power-sharing\" (usually in countries where people mainly identify themselves by race or religion) or \"electoral-college\" or \"constituency\" systems where the government is not chosen by a simple one-vote-per-person headcount.\n\nIn democracies, large proportions of the population may vote, either to make decisions or to choose representatives to make decisions. Commonly significant in democracies are political parties, which are groups of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems.\n\nLiberal democracy is a variant of democracy. It is a form of government in which representative democracy operates under the principles of liberalism. It is characterised by fair, free, and competitive elections between multiple distinct political parties, a separation of powers into different branches of government, the rule of law in everyday life as part of an open society, and the protection of human rights and civil liberties for all persons. To define the system in practice, liberal democracies often draw upon a constitution, either formally written or uncodified, to delineate the powers of government and enshrine the social contract. After a period of sustained expansion throughout the 20th century, liberal democracy became the predominant political system in the world. A liberal democracy may take various constitutional forms: it may be a republic, such as France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Taiwan, or the United States; or a constitutional monarchy, such as Japan, Spain, or the United Kingdom. It may have a presidential system (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, or the United States), a semi-presidential system (France, Portugal, or Taiwan), or a parliamentary system (Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, India, Italy, New Zealand, or the United Kingdom).\n\nA republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a \"public matter\" (Latin: \"res publica\"), not the private concern or property of the rulers, and where offices of states are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed rather than inherited. The people, or some significant portion of them, have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people. A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch. Montesquieu included both democracies, where all the people have a share in rule, and aristocracies or oligarchies, where only some of the people rule, as republican forms of government.\n\nOther terms used to describe different republics include Democratic republic, Parliamentary republic, Federal republic, and Islamic Republic.\n\nRule by authoritarian governments is identified in societies where a specific set of people possess the authority of the state in a republic or union. It is a political system controlled by unelected rulers who usually permit some degree of individual freedom. Rule by a totalitarian government is characterised by a highly centralised and coercive authority that regulates nearly every aspect of public and private life.\n\nIn contrast, a constitutional republic is rule by a government whose powers are limited by law or a formal constitution, and chosen by a vote amongst at least some sections of the populace (Ancient Sparta was in its own terms a republic, though most inhabitants were disenfranchised). Republics that exclude sections of the populace from participation will typically claim to represent all citizens (by defining people without the vote as \"non-citizens\"). Examples include the United States, South Africa, India, etc. \n\nFederalism is a political concept in which a \"group\" of members are bound together by covenant (Latin: \"foedus\", covenant) with a governing representative head. The term \"federalism\" is also used to describe a system of government in which sovereignty is constitutionally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units (such as states or provinces). Federalism is a system based upon democratic rules and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a federation. Proponents are often called federalists.\n\nHistorically, most political systems originated as socioeconomic ideologies. Experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.\n\n\nCertain major characteristics are defining of certain types; others are historically associated with certain types of government.\n\nThis list focuses on differing approaches that political systems take to the distribution of sovereignty, and the autonomy of regions within the state.\n\n\n\n"}

Throughout history lunar eclipses have been held to be responsible for lost battles, and have helped make possible extraordinary escapes.\n\nThe first mention of a lunar eclipse was found in the Chinese book Zhou-Shu, a book of the Zhou Dynasty. The book was discovered in 280 AD, in a tomb of a king or noblemen. The eclipse mentioned in this book took place many centuries before that time. Professor S.M. Russell believes that the eclipse described in the book may refer to the event that happened on 29 January 1137 BC (-1136).\n\nWhen eclipses were not well understood, they were sometimes associated with unnatural forces. Witches from the Greek region of Thessaly claimed the ability to extinguish the moon's light and draw it down from the sky. In his famous comedy \"The Clouds\" (419 BC), Aristophanes describes the eclipse that took place two years prior to that.\n\nThis eclipse happened during Second Battle of Syracuse. Just as the Athenians were preparing to sail home, there was a lunar eclipse, and Nicias, described by Thucydides as a particularly superstitious man, asked the priests what he should do. The priests suggested the Athenians wait for another 27 days, and Nicias agreed. The Syracusans took advantage of this, and 76 of their ships attacked 86 Athenian ships in the harbor. The Athenians were defeated and Eurymedon was killed. Many of the ships were pushed up on to the shore, where Gylippus was waiting. He killed some of the crews and captured 18 beached ships, but a force of Athenians and Etruscans forced Gylippus back. Plutarch described this eclipse and the superstitious response:\n\nThis partial lunar eclipse was seen during the Fall of Constantinople (the capture of the capital of the Byzantine Empire), during the siege that lasted from Thursday, 5 April 1453 until Tuesday, 29 May 1453), after which the city fell to the Ottomans. The lunar eclipse was considered to be fulfilling a prophecy for the city's demise. It is said a blood moon took place during the eclipse.\n\nOn 30 June 1503, Christopher Columbus beached his two last caravels and was stranded in Jamaica. The indigenous people of the island welcomed Columbus and his crew and fed them, but Columbus' sailors cheated and stole from the natives. After six months, the natives halted the food supply.\n\nColumbus had on board an almanac authored by Regiomontanus of astronomical tables covering the years 1475–1506; upon consulting the book, he noticed the date and the time of an upcoming lunar eclipse. He was able to use this information to his advantage. He requested a meeting for that day with the Cacique, the leader, and told him that his god was angry with the local people's treatment of Columbus and his men. Columbus said his god would provide a clear sign of his displeasure by making the rising full Moon appear \"inflamed with wrath\".\n\nThe lunar eclipse and the red moon appeared on schedule, and the indigenous people were impressed and frightened. The son of Columbus, Ferdinand, wrote that the people:\n\nColumbus timed the eclipse with his hourglass, and shortly before the totality ended after 48 minutes, he told the frightened indigenous people that they were going to be forgiven. When the moon started to reappear from the shadow of the Earth, he told them that his god had pardoned them.\n\nIn 1885 H. Rider Haggard used an altered version of the real story of the rescue of Columbus in his novel, \"King Solomon's Mines\". In that novel, Allan Quatermain and his fellow Englishmen use their foreknowledge of a solar eclipse to claim that they will black out the sun as proof of their powers, and save captive girls from an unjust death sentence.\n\nIn 1889 Mark Twain used a similar plot device in his novel, \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\". In that novel, Hank Morgan, a 19th-century resident of Hartford, Connecticut, after a blow to the head, awakens to find himself inexplicably transported back in time to early medieval England at the time of the legendary King Arthur. When Morgan is about to be burned at the stake, he pretends to conjure a solar eclipse that he knew was about to happen; this prediction saves Morgan's life.\n\nAnother novel that used a solar-eclipse scene modeled after Columbus' lunar eclipse was Bolesław Prus' historical novel, \"Pharaoh\".\n\nA similar plot also features in \"The Adventures of Tintin\" comic \"Prisoners of the Sun\".\n\nThe Ross Sea party was a component of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914–17. Five men were stranded not far away from Cape Evans. There was sea ice between them and the relative safety of the hut on Cape Evans. On 8 May two of the men, Aeneas Mackintosh and Victor Hayward, decided to make an attempt to reach the hut. Soon after they set out a blizzard hit. When the weather cleared up, the remaining men tried to look for them, but realized that the ice was far too thin to cross, and that their friends had been lost. Now they knew that they should wait for a thicker ice and for the full moon to attempt the crossing. Having the full moon was essential, because during polar night the Moon is the only source of natural light other than the extremely dim light of the stars.\n\nThe weather did not cooperate during the full moon of June, but on 15 July, everything seemed to be just right: calm weather, thick ice, clear skies and a full Moon. The men started their journey in the morning. When the Moon rose, however, the men were surprised to find it was about to be eclipsed. Ernest Wild wrote later: \nAlthough the eclipse continued for few hours, the men were fortunate because it was only a partial eclipse. They reached Cape Evans later on the same day.\n"}

How do you regard MEDVED?\" However, the hosts did not ask him the question.\n\nIn 2007, it was revived to be the number one most frequently asked question in a similar conference with the president of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. Nazarbayev answered the question seriously by describing the developments in the IT industry of Kazakhstan and the possible use of open-source software in it.\n\nIn December 2007, the question again became the most popular one preceding the Internet conference of Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko.

He also recommended the adoption of newer software (a possible reference to the existence of KDE3 at the time).\n\nIn February 2014, an OpenBSD ports developer gave an overview at the Linux Vacation / Eastern Europe conference in Belarus on how to patch KDE4 under OpenBSD, reviving the long-lived meme once again under a new light.\n\n"}

The festival now attracts over 60,000 people from all over the world and is seen as one of the 'Top 5 comedy festivals in the world' (The Guardian)\n\nSince then many top stand-up comedians have performed in the festival including Jo Brand, Jack Dee, Dave Gorman, Rory Bremner, Simon Pegg, Alan Davies, Bill Bailey, The Mighty Boosh, Johnny Vegas, Rich Hall, Jimmy Carr, Dara Ó Briain, Russell Howard, Dave Spikey, Harry Hill, Greg Davies, Sarah Millican and Romesh Ranganathan. The main programme is also complemented by workshops and outdoor street events to encourage the development of comedy skills. Every year towards the end of the Festival the Leicester Mercury Comedian of the Year is announced.\n\n2014 saw the inaugural UK Pun Championships, at the festival, hosted by Lee Nelson. The winner was Darren Walsh. The competition included the line \"My computer's got a Miley Virus. It's stopped twerking.\" Walsh went on to take part in the O. Henry Pun-Off World Championships in Austin, Texas.\n\nIn 2015, Leo Kearse beat off competition from fellow comedians Rob Thomas and reigning champion Darren Walsh to become the UK Pun Champion. Leo won the contest with such jokes as \"\"I was in hospital last week. I asked the nurse if I could do my own stitches. She said “suture self”\" and \"Growing up on a farm, my dad was always telling me to use the indoor toilet. But I preferred to go against the grain\" \n\n2016 saw the return of the UK Pun Championships hosted again by Lee Nelson. This year the winner was West Midlands comedian Masai Graham, with jokes such as \"What's the difference between a hippo and a zippo? One's really heavy and the other is a little lighter\" and \"I love playing PGA Golf, but to say I have a weak shot on the greens would be putting it mildly\" \n\nThe 2017 UK Pun Championships saw a new location in De Montfort Hall and host in Jason Byrne. It also saw the introduction of a new layout for the show, with the \"Pun Off's\" taking place within a boxing ring that had been constructed within the centre of the stalls. Lovdev Barpaga aka \"The 'Pun'jabi Warrior'\" won against Julian Lee in the final. Lovdevs jokes included \"Pakistani Pirates. Urdu they think they argh?\" and \"I think my Colombian neighbour's a drug lord, but I just car tell.\"\n\nThe 2018 UK Pun Championships returned to De Montfort Hall in the boxing ring with host Jason Byrne on the 13th of February. After being beaten in the 2015 by Leo Kearse, Rob Thomas returned and beat 2nd time finalist Julian Lee to the title. Rob Thomas' puns included: \"When Leicester won the league, my mum bought a candle to celebrate. Now it just languishes in the middle of the table\" and \"Brexit. It's like a catheter for Britain.

Since early 1983, various companies in the Americas, Europe and Israel have published books based on the franchise. In the United States, the Care Bears' books have been available through Random House, Parker Brothers and Scholastic Books.\n\nParker Brothers, a board game company then owned by General Mills, launched its book publishing division in February 1983; its first series consisted of six books featuring the Care Bears. Various authors contributed to the resulting series, \"Tales from the Care Bears\"; Tom Cooke illustrated most of the stories. At the time of publication, various trade publications took note of Parker Brothers' unique marketing strategy for the books. On October 30, 1987, Great Britain's Octopus Books released a book under this title (), containing Amelia Hubert's \"Sweet Dreams for Sally\" and Evelyn Mason's \"A Sister for Sam\".\n\nParker Brothers spent US$1 million in advertising on the original six-book series, which was made to promote the Care Bears characters. According to a company spokesperson, the stories would demonstrate \"love, caring, dreams, happiness, friendship, wishes, and feelings\". The series made its debut at the 1983 American International Toy Fair, along with other Care Bears products. John Keller, editorial director for the books, commented on their creation:\n\nIn 1983, the U.S. publishing company Random House was granted paperback rights to books in the Care Bears franchise through American Greetings and General Mills, as Parker Brothers was unable to secure the exclusive publishing rights at the time. Bruce Jones, a Parker Brothers staffer, could not secure the exclusive publishing rights, and had to settle for a split license with Random House. During the mid-1980s, Dorsey Laboratories promoted its Triaminic cough medicine through a Random House publication, \"The Care Bears Help Chase Colds\"; this promotion helped sell over two million units of the product, along with a free copy of said book.\n\nA few months after the 2002 relaunch of the Care Bears franchise, Scholastic Books published its first titles featuring the characters.\n\nIn 1984, Parker Brothers' \"Tales from the Care Bears\" made their appearance in Spain as the \"Un Cuento de Los Osos Amorosos\" series. The titles in this version were published by that country's division of General Mills, and translated from the original English by Leopoldo Rodríguez Regueira.\n\nIn 1987, Montena D.L. published two books featuring the Care Bears: \"Juego con los Osos Amorosos\" () and \"Dónde, cómo, qué\". That same year, Madrid's Mondadori published \"Feliz cumpleaños, Osos Amorosos\".\n\nFrance's division of General Mills published Danièle Laufer's translations of the \"Tales\" in 1984.\n\nThe \"Tales from the Care Bears\" were also published in German in 1984.\n\nThese titles were published by Brazil's Fundamento, under the local franchise name \"Ursinhos Carinhosos\".\nThese were published in 2004 by Denmark's K.E. Media, and translated by Søren Lampe.\nAround 1987, Israel's Modan published Hebrew versions of selected \"Tales from the Care Bears\", marketed for this country as \"Sipur mi-sipure Dube'khpat li\". ʻIvri Shafrirah Zakai and Tom Ḳuḳ served as the translators.\n\nShafrirah Zakai wrote another four books featuring the characters, also from Modan: \"Dube'khpat li ṿe-taḥarut ha-kishronot\", \"Dubeʼkhpat li ṿeha-beʻayah ha-ḳeṭanah\", \"Dubeʼkhpat li ṿe-tahalukhat ha-ḳarnaval\" and \"Dubeʼkhpat li ṿeha-mirdaf aḥare ha-otsar\".\n\n\"Urodziny urwisa\", an Ewa Ziółkowska translation of an earlier French work by Imelda Heuschen, was published in 1994 by Warsaw's RTV ().\n\n\n"}

The term was coined by linguist Malcolm Ross.\n\nRoss (1999: 7, 1) gives the following definition:\n\n[Metatypy is a] \"change in morphosyntactic type and grammatical organisation\" [and also semantic patterns] \"which a language undergoes as a result of its speakers’ bilingualism in another language. This change is driven by grammatical calquing, i.e. the copying of constructional meanings from the modified language and the innovation of new structures using inherited material to express them. A concomitant of this reorganisation of grammatical constructions is often the reorganisation or creation of paradigms of grammatical functors... Usually, the language undergoing metatypy (the modified language) is emblematic of its speakers’ identity, whilst the language which provides the metatypic model is an inter-community language. Speakers of the modified language form a sufficiently tightknit community to be well aware of their separate identity and of their language as a marker of that identity, but some bilingual speakers, at least, use the inter-community language so extensively that they are more at home in it than in the emblematic language of the community.\"\n\nRoss (2002) identifies the following metatypic changes:\n\n\nRoss finds that semantic reorganization occurs before syntactic restructuring. The syntactic changes occur in the order of (i) sentence/clause, (ii) phrase, and (iii) words.\n\nHere are some languages that have undergone metatypy:\n\nThe example given by Ross (1999) is the \"Papuanisation\" of the Takia language (of the Oceanic family, western branch) because of influence from the neighbouring Waskia language (of the Madang family, Trans–New Guinea). In Ross' terminology, Takia is the \"modified language\" and Waskia is the \"inter-community language\". Waskia, however, does not seem to have been significantly influenced by Takia. Both languages are spoken on Karkar Island. \n\nThe end result of the metatypic change leaves Takia usually having a word-for-word Waskia translation such as the following:\n\nThe pairing of syntactic and semantic structures makes this word-for-word translation possible. Some of the grammatical changes that Takia has undergone include the following:\n\nThe diffusional changes of Takia are only in terms of metatypy: Takia has not altered its phonology and has virtually no loanwords borrowed from Waskia.\n\n"}

It was initially incorporated in California as a private organization with Ferguson in charge of fund-raising. The first project by the NWAF was headed by Pedro Armillas with archaeological studies along the Grijalva River.\n\nAs early as 1953, the NWAF received funding from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after Ferguson approached church leaders.

Three years after receiving his PhD in philosophy at the University of La Plata in 1975, thanks to a scholarship awarded from CONICET (The National Scientific and Technical Research Council), García Canclini also received another PhD in philosophy from the Paris Nanterre University. He taught at the University of La Plata between 1966 and 1975 and at the University of Buenos Aires in 1974 and 1975. Throughout his academic career he has also served as a visiting professor at University of Naples, UT Austin, Stanford University, University of Barcelona and São Paulo. Since 1990 García Canclini has been working as a professor and researcher at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana in Mexico City and until 2007 he directed the university’s program studies on urban culture. He is also a researcher emeritus of the National System of Investigators under the National Council of Science and Technology (Conacyt) of Mexico.\n\nIn the text \"Comunicación y consumo en tiempos neoconservadores\" (Communication and Consumerism in Neoconservative Times), the theorist affirms that communications research, centered in the social sciences, has made areas of Latin American cultural development visible, in which the relationship between consumerism and citizenship is established. Consumerism, a product of globalization, has generated a new conception of the citizen, while the quantity of goods that a person can acquire determines the social status that they have and therefore the role of the common citizen, in terms of political participation (mainly) depends on how the consumer is.\n\nThe principal cause of the aforementioned phenomenon is globalization. For Canclini, this concept does not have its own definition, rather, it depends on the circumstances and the contexts which are presented. In the Latin American case, globalization is not a perceptible fact, instead an imagined concept, that is to say, it constitutes a paradigm in Latin American society that governs the relations between different individuals (there is a notion that it “exists,” but in reality it is the product of a series of values that Latin American society has imposed upon itself to resemble the first world).\n\nThe previous can be seen reflected in the critique of marketing studies that only counts the economic figures of Latin America’s entry into world trade, but do not take into account the symbolic-social change that this generates, in his book \"La globalización imaginada\" (The Imagined Globalization), chapter ‘Mercado e Interculturalidad: América Latina entre Europa y Estados Unidos’ (Market and Interculturality: Latin America between Europe and the United States). In respect to the last main idea of the investigation, Canclini suggests that the Latin American cultural space and transitional circuits are immersed in imagined constructions about the identity of us and of others; the Latin American elite constructs the city in resemblance to the great European and American metropolises, while the rest of the town seeks to survive with its traditions in the modernizing process.\"La industria cultural es analizada como matriz de desorganización y reorganización de una experiencia temporal mucho más compatible con las desterritorializaciones y relocalizaciones que implican las migraciones sociales y las fragmentaciones culturales de la vida urbana que la que configuran la cultura de élite o la cultura popular, ambas ligadas a una temporalidad “moderna”; esto es, una experiencia hecha de sedimentaciones, acumulaciones e innovaciones. Industria cultural y comunicaciones masivas designan los nuevos procesos de producción y circulación de la cultura, que corresponden no sólo a innovaciones tecnológicas sino a nuevas formas de la sensibilidad, a nuevos tipos de recepción, de disfrute y apropiación.\"English Translation:The cultural industry is analyzed like a matrix of disorganization and reorganization of a temporary experience much more compatible with the deterritorializations and relocations that imply social migrations and cultural fragmentations of urban life that configure the elite culture and popular culture, both bound to a temporary “modernity,” this is, an experience made of sedimentations, accumulations and innovations. Cultural industry and massive communications design new processes of production and circulation of culture, that correspond not only to technological innovations but also new forms of sensibility, new forms of reception, of enjoyment and appropriation. In the book \"Lectores, espectadores e internautas\" (Readers, Spectators, and Internet Users), Canclini asks us: What does it mean to be a reader, spectator, and internet user? What are the cultural habits of a person that concurs in these three activities? Canclini speaks of the reader in two sentiments, the first making reference to the literary field like Hans Robert Jauss and the second through the editorial system like Umberto Eco does. Canclini accuses the system of wanting to generate new readers only through printed media, without taking into account digital media. The concept of the spectator is linked to the types of shows that they attend, cinema, television, recitals etc. And the internet-user is \"un actor multimodal que lee, ve, escucha y combina materiales diversos, procedentes de la lectura y de los espectáculos\" (a multimodal actor that reads, sees, listens, and combines diverse materials, from readings and entertainment).\n\nThe book develops in the form of a dictionary, starting with A for ‘apertura’(aperture) and the Z for zipping. He describes new concepts that have brought the digital age. The reader - spectator - and internet user read more on the internet than on paper. This book shows us both the benefits of technology and its negative aspects that are familiar to us all.\n\nCanclini has been one of the principal anthropologists that has treated Modernity, Postmodernity, and Culture from the Latin American perspective. One of the principal terms he has coined is “cultural hybridization,” a phenomenon that “materializes in multi-determined scenarios where diverse systems intersect and interpenetrate.” An example of this is contemporary music groups that mix or juxtapose global trends such as pop with indigenous or traditional rhythms. One of his best-known works, \"Consumidores y ciudadanos\" (Consumers and Citizens) defines consumption as \"the set of socio-cultural processes in which the appropriation and uses of products are carried out.\"\n\nThis text is foundational to Latin American Cultural Studies and is now considered a classic. Canclini takes an interdisciplinary approach to social thought to critically reimagine Latin American issues pertaining to modernity and democracy, \"Néstor García Canclini explores the tensions, verging on contradictions, between modernization and democratization in Latin American nation-states. These states regard themselves caught between traditions that have not yet gone and a modernity that has not yet arrived. From its hybrid position between tradition and modernity, the challenge for Latin America is to construct democratic culture and knowledge without succumbing either to the temptations of elite art and literature or to the coercive forces of mass media and marketing. In a work of committed scholarship the author both interrogates and advocates the development of democratic institutions and practices in Latin America.\"Canclini analyzes and synthesizes the theories of Bourdieu, Gramsci, Weber, elite literary works and popular culture to envision a Latin American praxis that celebrates hybridization “as an ongoing condition of all human cultures, which contains no zones of purity because they undergo continuous processes of transculturation (two-way borrowing and lending between cultures).\" Thereby imagined cultural borders are actually very porous.\n\n\n\nIn 1996 Canclini received a Diploma of Merit from the Konex Foundation in the category of «Aesthetic, Theory and Art History». He also received the Guggenheim Scholarship, the Essay Award granted by Casa de las Américas and the Book Award from the Latin American Studies Association for his book \"Hybrid Cultures\" as the best book in Spanish about Latin America.\n\nIn 2012 Canclini received from National University of Cordoba the University Prize for Culture “400 years” during the opening of the Third International Congress of the Argentine Association of Cinema and Audiovisual Studies of which he was inaugural speaker. In 2014 the Ministry of Public Education awarded him the National Prize for Science and Arts in the area of History, Social Sciences and Philosophy. In 2017 at the close of the VIII National and Latin American V: The University as an Object of Study \"The University Reform between two centuries,\" Canclini received the 33rd Honoris Causa of the National University of the Coast.\n\nGarcía Canclini, Néstor (1995).

She is also known as the cousin of the famous writer Boris Pasternak; their correspondence has been published and studied.\n\nOlga Freidenberg was born to Anna Osipovna Pasternak and Mikhail Filippovich Freidenberg in Odessa. The family moved to St Petersburg in 1903 and Freidenberg graduated from a gymnasium there in 1908. Restricted in her ability to pursue university education as a woman and a Jew, she travelled through Europe studying foreign languages on her own and living in Germany, Sweden, Italy, and Switzerland. As World War I broke out, she returned to Russia and became a military nurse.\n\nFreidenberg returned to her studies at Petrograd University in 1923 and wrote a Ph.D. thesis in 1924, titled \"The Origins of the\" \"Greek Novel\". The University had only started accepting women as students in 1917, and Friedenberg was the first woman to defend her thesis in classical philology. In 1935 she was awarded the Russian highest scientific degree of Doctor of Science. Since all of the Classics Departments in Russia had been shut since 1921, Freidenberg played a key role in founding the new Classical Department at Petrograd University. Freidenberg also founded the chair of classical philology and was head of the Classical Department from 1932–1950.\n\nIn her work, Freidenberg drew comparison between pagan erotic novels and both Acts (Apocryphal and Canonical) and Gospels. She defined a narrative genre of ‘Acts and Passions’ of a hero as their common basis. Freidenberg was the first in Europe to conclude that the ‘Greek’ novel was Oriental in its origin. She noted that the archetypal patterns in the plots of its different narratives were versions of the \"legomenon\" which can be traced back to the \"dromenon\" of fertility cults.\n\nDuring the Stalin era she was persecuted and her brother was arrested. In 1950, as part of the persecution of \"rootless cosmopolitans\" she was fired from Petrograd University. For example, Freidenberg's 1935 dissertation \"The Poetics of Plot and Genre: The Classical Period of Ancient Literature\" was the only book published in her lifetime (in 1936) but was denounced by the Soviet authorities and taken out of circulation shortly afterwards. It was republished in 1997.\n\nMany of Freidenberg's works were not published in her lifetime and some still remain unpublished. Modern scholars, such as Nina Perlina and Nina Braginskaya, are now publishing new editions of Freidenberg's works in English. Freidenberg's work is now being reviewed and reassessed, particularly in examinations of early Greek thought.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24277", "title": "Paul Bunyan", "text": "Paul Bunyan\n\nPaul Bunyan is a giant lumberjack in American folklore. His exploits revolve around the tall tales of his superhuman labors, and he is customarily accompanied by Babe the Blue Ox. The character originated in the oral tradition of North American loggers, and was later popularized by freelance writer William B. Laughead (1882–1958) in a 1916 promotional pamphlet for the Red River Lumber Company. He has been the subject of various literary compositions, musical pieces, commercial works, and theatrical productions. His likeness is displayed in several oversized statues across North America.\n\nThere are many hypotheses about the etymology of the name \"Paul Bunyan\". Much of the commentary focuses on a Franco-Canadian origin for the name. Phonetically Bunyan is similar to the Québécois expression \"bon yenne!\" expressing surprise or astonishment. The English surname Bunyan is derived from the same root as bunion in the Old French \"bugne\", referring to a large lump or swelling. Several researchers have attempted to trace Paul Bunyan to the character of Bon Jean of French Canadian folklore.\n\nMichael Edmonds states in his 2009 book \"Out of the Northwoods: The Many Lives of Paul Bunyan\" that Paul Bunyan stories circulated for at least thirty years before finding their way into print. In contrast to the lengthy narratives abundant in published material, Paul Bunyan \"stories\" when told in the lumbercamp bunkhouses were presented in short fragments. Some of these stories include motifs from older folktales, such as absurdly severe weather and fearsome critters. Parallels in early printings support the view that at least a handful of Bunyan stories hold a common origin in folklore. The earliest recorded reference to Paul Bunyan is an uncredited 1904 editorial in the \"Duluth News Tribune\" which recounts:\n\nEach of these elements recurs in later accounts, including logging the Dakotas, a giant camp, the winter of the blue snow, and stove skating. All four anecdotes are mirrored in J. E. Rockwell's \"Some Lumberjack Myths\" six years later, and James MacGillivray wrote on the subject of stove skating in \"Round River\" four years before that. MacGillivray's account, somewhat extended, reappeared in \"The American Lumberman\" in 1910. \"The American Lumberman\" followed up with a few sporadic editorials, such as \"Paul Bunyan's Oxen,\" \"In Paul Bunyan's Cook Shanty,\" and \"Chronicle of Life and Works of Mr. Paul Bunyan.\" Rockwell's earlier story was one of the few to allude to Paul Bunyan's large stature, \"eight feet tall and weighed 300 pounds,\" and introduce his big blue ox, prior to Laughead's commercialization of Paul Bunyan, although W .D. Harrigan did refer to a giant pink ox in \"Paul Bunyan's Oxen,\" circa 1914. In all the articles, Paul Bunyan is praised as a logger of great physical strength and unrivaled skill.\n\nK. Bernice Stewart, a student at the University of Wisconsin, was working contemporaneously with Laughead to gather Paul Bunyan stories from woodsmen in the Midwest. Stewart was able to make a scholarly anthology of original anecdotes through a series of interviews. These were published in 1916 as \"Legends of Paul Bunyan, Lumberjack\" in \"Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts and Letters\" and coauthored by her English professor Homer A. Watt. The research relates traditional narratives, some in multiple versions, and goes on to conclude that many probably existed in some part before they were set to revolve around Bunyan as a central character. Stewart argued in her analysis that Paul Bunyan belongs to a class of traveler's tales.\n\nCharles E. Brown was the curator of the Museum of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin and secretary of the Wisconsin Archaeological Society. He was another principal researcher who recorded early Paul Bunyan stories from lumberjacks. He published these anecdotes in short pamphlet format for the use of students of folklore. Much of his research was financed through the government-funded Wisconsin Writers' Program.\n\nIn 2007, Michael Edmonds of the Wisconsin Historical Society began a thorough reinvestigation of the Paul Bunyan tradition, publishing his findings in \"Out of the Northwoods: The Many Lives of Paul Bunyan\". Edmonds concluded that Paul Bunyan had origins in the oral traditions of woodsmen working in Wisconsin camps during the turn of the 20th century, but such stories were heavily embellished and popularized by commercial interests.\n\nLaughead, in 1916, devised the original advertising pamphlet for the Red River Lumber Company utilizing the Paul Bunyan folk character. Laughead reworked original folklore while adding some tales of his own. This has led to significant confusion as to Paul Bunyan's legitimacy as a genuine folkloric character. Laughead took many liberties with the original oral source material. While still a lumberjack of gigantic stature and size with extreme power and strength, Laughead increased Paul Bunyan's height to tower over trees as well attributed him to the creation of several American landscapes, landmarks and natural wonders. Laughhead noted that Paul Bunyan and Babe are said to have created the 10,000 lakes of Minnesota by their footprints. Later commenters would elaborate in more detail pointing out bodies of water such as Lake Bemidji. Some observers have noted that Lake Bemidji, itself, has a shape resembling something of a giant footprint when viewed from high above. Furthermore, latter authors, and possibly tourist agents, would add other geographic features to those Paul Bunyan was suppose to have created. Among others, Paul Bunyan has been credited with creating the Grand Canyon by pulling his ax behind him, and Mount Hood by putting stones on his campfire.\n\nRunning at variance to his origins in folklore, the character of Paul Bunyan has become a fixture for juvenile audiences since his debut in print. Typical among such adaptations is the further embellishment of stories pulled directly from William B. Laughead's pamphlet, and with very few elements from oral tradition adapted into them. Nearly all of the literature is presented in long narrative format, exaggerates Paul Bunyan's height to colossal proportions, and follows him from infancy to adulthood.\n\nSome of the more enduring collections of stories include \"Paul Bunyan\" by James Stevens, \"Paul Bunyan Swings His Axe\" by Dell J. McCormick, \"Paul Bunyan\" by Esther Shephard, \"Paul Bunyan and His Great Blue Ox\" by Wallace Wadsworth, and \"The Marvelous Exploits of Paul Bunyan\" by William Laughead.\n\n\" Legends of Paul Bunyan\" (1947) was the first book published by the prolific tall tale writer Harold Felton.\n\nIn 1958, Walt Disney Studios produced \"Paul Bunyan\" as an animated short musical. The feature starred Thurl Ravenscroft, perhaps best known as the voice of Tony the Tiger for The Kellogg Company, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.\n\nIn 2017, an animated film based loosely on the folktale titled \"Bunyan and Babe\" was released, starring John Goodman as Paul Bunyan.\n\nCommentators such as Carleton C. Ames, Marshall Fitwick, and particularly Richard Dorson cite Paul Bunyan as an example of \"fakelore,\" a literary invention passed off as an older folktale. They point out that the majority of books about Paul Bunyan are composed almost entirely of elements with no basis in folklore, especially those targeted at juvenile audiences. Modern commercial writers are credited with setting Paul Bunyan on his rise to a nationally recognized figure, but this ignores the historical roots of the character in logging camps and forest industries.\n\nAt the same time, several authors have come forward to propose alternative origins for Paul Bunyan. D. Laurence Rogers and others have suggested a possible connection between Paul Bunyan tales and the exploits of French-Canadian lumberjack Fabian Fournier (1845 – 1875). From 1865 to 1875, Fournier worked for the H. M. Loud Company in the Grayling, Michigan area. James Stevens in his 1925 book \"Paul Bunyan\" makes another unverified claim that Paul Bunyan was a soldier in the Papineau Rebellion named Paul Bon Jean, and this is occasionally repeated in other accounts.\n\nStewart and Watt acknowledge that they have not yet succeeded in definitively finding out whether Bunyan actually lived or was wholly mythical. They have noted, however, that some of the older lumberjacks whom they interviewed claimed to have known him or members of his crew, and the supposed location of his grave was actually pointed out in northern Minnesota. Bunyan's extreme gigantism was a later invention, and early stories either do not mention it or, as in the Stewart and Watt paper, refer to him as being about seven feet tall.\n\nIncluded in this section is a comparison chart between early Paul Bunyan references, the Stewart and Watt paper, and the Laughead advertisement.\n\nWilliam B. Laughead, an independent adman, was the first to utilize Paul Bunyan for commercial use in a series of campaigns for the Red River Lumber Company. His first endeavor was a pamphlet entitled \"Introducing Mr. Paul Bunyan of Westwood, California,\" but it did not prove effective. It was not until \"Tales about Paul Bunyan, Vol. II\" appeared that the campaign gained momentum. Embellishing older exploits and adding some of his own, Laughead's revamped Paul Bunyan did not stay faithful to the original folktales. Among other things, Laughead gave the name \"Babe\" to the blue ox, increased Paul Bunyan's height to impossible proportions, and created the first pictorial representation of Bunyan. This has led to significant confusion regarding the validity of Paul Bunyan as a genuine folkloric character. Nevertheless, the Laughead pamphlets are regarded as one of the most popular collections, often appearing in a single, unabridged volume entitled: \"The Marvelous Exploits of Paul Bunyan.\" The Red River ad campaign ingrained Paul Bunyan as a nationally recognized figure, and it also affirmed his massive marketing appeal. Throughout the better part of the century, Paul Bunyan's name and image continued to be utilized in promoting various products, cities, and services. Across North America, giant statues of Paul Bunyan were erected to promote local businesses and tourism. A significant portion of these were produced from the 1960s through the 1970s by the company International Fiberglass as part of their \"Muffler Men\" series of giant fiberglass sculptures.\n\nThe statue of Paul Bunyan is regularly mentioned in the novel \"IT\" by Stephen King.\n\n"}

Lewis' edited \"Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft\" anthology, Siân Reid described Luhrmann's work as \"a solid ethnography\". Nevertheless, she felt that the study \"occasionally rings hollow\" because Luhrmann failed to take into account the \"subjective motivations for magical practice\".\nIn her anthropological study of the U.S. Pagan community, \"Witching Culture\" (2004), the American academic Sabina Magliocco noted that her work both built upon and departed from Luhrmann's.\n"}

It was organised by a coalition of 260 non-profit organisations at Pune's Shaniwarwada Fort, and had approximately 35,000 people in attendance. The program consisted of a number of cultural performances, speeches and slogans.\n\n\"Elgaar\" means loud invitation or loud declaration.\n\nThe event was organised at the Shaniwarwada Fort in Pune on the eve of the bicentennial anniversary of the Battle of Bhima Koregaon. The Shaniwarwada Fort was the seat of power of the Peshwas, the de-facto rulers of the Maratha Empire. Under the Peshwas, the caste system was practiced rigidly, and oppression of the lower castes was severe. In the Battle of Bhima Koregaon, a regiment of Mahar Dalits under the British Army had defeated the Peshwa's army. This victory is very important to Dalits, who see it as a victory over their oppressors. Organising the Parishad at the Shaniwarwada Fort was thus seen as a symbol of Dalit assertion.\n\nBefore the event, two marches were organised through several districts of Maharashtra and culminating in Pune with artists, activists, theatre performers and musicians among others. These marches held public meetings to rally support for Dalit victims of atrocities and collect donations for the Elgar Parishad.\n\nThe event began at 2 PM under six tents pitched in front of the Shaniwarwada Fort. After the tents filled up at 2.30, police refused to let more people in, fearing stampede. The stage seated the organisers and speakers of the event, including Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, Dalit activist Radhika Vemula, Adivasi activist Soni Sori, Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar, Bhim Army President Vinay Ratan Singh, retired Bombay High Court Justice BG Kholse-Patil, and student leader Umar Khalid.\n\nA number of cultural performances with anti-caste themes were staged. Shahirs performed songs in tribute of Tukaram, Jotirao Phule, Shivaji and Shahu. A dance troupe performed actobatics and hip-hop groups also performed. Before Radhika Vemula made her speech, she was invited to smash a stack of pots signifying the varna system in a symbolic gesture of annihilating caste. Vadgam MLA and anti-caste activist, Jignesh Mevani read out an extract from Narendra Modi's book, Karmyog, which said that the work of cleaning excreta, a task mostly performed by Dalits due to caste compulsions, is an experience in spirituality. He later had an FIR filed against him. \n\nOn 1 January 2018, violence broke out at Bhima Koregaon, where lakhs of Dalits had converged to commemorate the battle. One person was killed, and three others injured.\n\nIn the months following the event, a number of people present at the event were arrested under laws such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). This included Surendra Gadling, Rona Wilson, Mahesh Raut, Sudhir Dhawale and Shoma Sen. Pune Police alleged that the event was sponsored by Maoists. An FIR was filed against Jignesh Mevani for promoting enmity on grounds of religion.\n\nIt was alleged by the Pune Police that the event was organised by members of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist). They said that it instigated violence at Bhima Koregaon. However, Justices BG Kolse-Patil and PB Sawant refuted their claims. The Justices said that it was the two of them who were the main organisers and sole funders of the event, and that they had held a similar event against communalism and Hindutva in October 2015 at the same venue.\n\n \n"}

It comes from roots \"aza\" (عزو and عزى) which means mourning.\n\nDepending on the region, time, occasion, religion, etc. the word can signify different cultural meanings and practices:\nTa'zieh, primarily known from the Persian tradition, is a shi'ite Muslim ritual that reenacts the death of Hussein (the prophet Muhammad's grandson) and his male children and companions in a brutal massacre on the plains of Karbala, Iraq in the year 680 A.D. His death was the result of a power struggle in the decision of control of the Muslim community (called the caliph) after the death of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nToday, we know of 250 Ta'zieh pieces. They were collected by an Italian ambassador to Iran, Cherulli, and added to a collection which can be found in the Vatican Library. Various other scripts can be found scattered throughout Iran.\n\nTa'zieh as a kind of passion play is a kind of comprehensive indigenous form considered as being the national form of Iranian theatre which have pervasive influence in the Iranian works of drama and play. It originates from some famous mythologies and rites such as Mithraism, Sug-e-Siavush (Mourning for Siavush) and Yadegar-e-Zariran or Memorial of Zarir. The Ta'zieh tradition originated in Iran in the late 17th century.\n\nThere are two branches of Islam; the Sunni and the Shi'i. The Sunnis make up about 85-90% of Muslims, but the Ta'zieh tradition is performed by Shi'i Muslims during the first month of the Muslim calendar, Muharram, one of the four sacred months of the Islam calendar. Muharram means forbidden. The Ta'Zieh is performed each year on the 10th day of Muharram, a historically significant day for the Shi'i Muslims because that was the day of Hussein's slaughter. Each year the same story is told, so the spectators know the story very well and know what to expect. However, this does not negatively affect audience levels. In fact, the Ta'zieh welcomes large crowds and the audience members are known to cry each time the story is told in mourning and respect for Hussein.\n\nA strong belief in the Muslim community was that nothing created by regular people could be better than the way Allah created it, so all other creation was deemed disrespectful. Because of this, there are not many accounts-visually or otherwise- of this religious tradition. During the tradition it was very important that all spectators knew the actors were not disrespecting Allah, so most often, the actors had their scripts on stage with them so it was clear that they were not trying to depict another person that Allah did not create. The ritual was eventually banned by the authorities in Iran because the ritual was being exploited for political advances. Ta'zieh is not performed regularly in Iran and has not been seen at all in certain provinces of the region since 1920. France was the first non-Muslim country that Ta'zieh was performed in 1991. Since then, the tradition has been seen in non-Persian cities like Avignon and Paris in France, Parma and Rome in Italy, and New York City.\n\nIn Persian culture it refers to condolence theater and Naqqali which are traditional Persian theatrical genres in which the drama is conveyed wholly or predominantly through music and singing. It dates from before the Islamic era and the tragedy of Saiawush in Shahnameh is one of the best examples.\n\nIn Persian tradition, Ta'zieh and Parde-khani, inspired by historical and religious events, symbolize epic spirit and resistance. The common themes are heroic tales of love and sacrifice and of resistance against the evil.\n\nWhile in the West the two major genres of drama have been comedy and tragedy, in Persia, Ta'zieh seems to be the dominant genre. Considered as Persian opera, Ta'zieh resembles European opera in many respects.\n\nPersian cinema and Persian symphonic music have been influenced by the long tradition of Ta'zieh in Iran. Abbas Kiarostami, famous Iranian film maker, made a documentary movie titled \"A Look to Ta'zieh\" in which he explores the relationship of the audience to this theatrical form. Nasser Taghvaee also made a documentary on Ta'zieh titled \"Tamrin e Akhar\".\n\nThe appearance of the characteristic dramatic form of Persia known as the \"ta'zïye\" Mu'izz ad-Dawla, the king of Buyid dynasty, in 963. As soon as the Safavid Dynasty was established in Persia in 1501 and the Shiism of the Twelvers adopted as the official sect, the state took interest in theater as a tool of propagating Shiism.\n\nWomen were not considered active members of the Ta'zieh performance ritual. Almost all women in these rituals were played by young males, however on some occasions little girls under the age of nine were able to fulfill small roles. Women were traditionally played by males who would wear all black and veil their faces. During the festival period, the tekyehs were lavishly decorated by the women of the community that the performance took place, with the prized personal possessions of the local community. Refreshments were prepared by women and served to the spectators by the children of well-off families. Society women were invited to watch the performance from the boxes above the general viewing area. Generally the audience consisted of the more well-off families as they regarded Ta'zieh as entertainment, while the lower-class community members thought of it as an important religious ritual. The Ta'Zieh gained popularity during the 19th century and women painted scenes from Ta'Zieh performances on the stage on canvases and recorded history. This was a huge step in the history of islamic art.\n\nIn Persian Ta'Zieh, the space is very important. Originally, Ta'zieh dramas, like other Western Passion Plays, were performed in a public arena, allowing large audiences to convene. They later moved to smaller spaces like courtyards and spaces within the homes of private citizens, but eventually ended up being performed in temporarily constructed performance spaces called tekyehs or husseiniyehs. The most famous tekyeh is called the Tekyeh Dowlat. It was built by the King of Persia, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar and was situated in the capital of Iran, Tehran. Tekyehs (with the exception of the Tekyeh Dowlat) were almost always constructed for temporary use and then demolished at the end of Muharram. The Tekyeh Dowlat was a permanent space built in 1868, but was torn down 79 years later in 1947 due to lack of use and replaced by a bank. Its capacity was 4,000. They varied in size fitting anywhere between a dozen to thousands of spectators. Tekyehs were somewhat open-air, but almost always had awnings of sorts atop the building to shield the spectators and actors from sun and rain. All performers in a Ta'Zieh ceremony never leave the stage. The stage is elevated between one and two feet from the ground and split into four areas: one for the protagonists, antagonists, smaller subplots, and props.\n\nUnlike most other theater traditions, especially Western theater traditions, the Ta'Zieh stage and its use of props were minimalist and stark. All tekyehs are designed so that the Ta'Zieh performance happens in-the-round to create a more intense experience between the actors and the audience. This enabled spectators to feel like they were part of the action on stage and sometimes encouraged them to become physically active members of the performance.\n\nCostumes for a Ta'Zieh ritual are what is considered representational in terms of theater. They are not meant to present reality. The main goal of the costume design was not to be historically accurate, but to help the audience recognize which type of character they were looking at. Villains were the Sunni opponents of Imam Hussein. They are always dressed in red. The protagonists, family members of Hussein, were dressed in green if they were male characters. Anyone about to die was in white. Women were always portrayed by men in all black. One way to distinguish character besides the color of their costume is how they deliver their lines. The protagonists or family of Imam Hussein sing or chant their lines and the villains will declaim their lines. If a person is traveling in a circle on or around the stage, that meant they were going a long distance (usually represented the distance between Mecca and Karbala). Traveling in a straight line represented a shorter distance traveled.\n\nOften animals were used in the performance of a Ta'zieh. Often performers of Ta'zieh were on horseback. Most men from the time they were young would train to be able to ride a horse because it was an honor in Persian culture to be part of the Ta'zieh, especially to play a character who rode horseback. There were often other animals used in the tradition as well. These other animals were: camels, sheep or sometimes even a lion. Usually the lion is not real, and is just represented by a man wearing a mask of some sort.\n\nShia Muslims take out a Ta'zīya (locally spelled Tazia, Tabut or Taboot) procession on day of Ashura in South Asia.\n\nThe artwork is a colorfully painted bamboo and paper mausoleum. This ritual procession is also observed by south Asian Muslims in, \nIn the Caribbean it is known as Tadjah and was brought by Shia Muslim who arrived there as indentured labourers from the Indian subcontinent.\n\nTabuik made from bamboo, rattan and paper is a local manifestation of the Remembrance of Muharram among the Minangkabau people in the coastal regions of West Sumatra, Indonesia, particularly in the city of Pariaman culminates with practice of throwing a \"tabuik\" into the sea has taken place every year in Pariaman on the 10th of Muharram since 1831 when it was introduced to the region by Shia Muslim \"sepoy\" troops from India who were stationed and later settled there during the British Raj.\nDuring the colonial era in British India, the \"ta'zīya\" tradition was not only practiced by Shia Muslims and other Muslims but joined by Hindus. Along with occasions for Shia Muslims and Hindus to participate in the procession together, the Tazia procession have also been historic occasions for communal conflicts between Sunni and Shia Muslims and between Hindu and Muslim communities since the 19th century. These Tazia processions have traditionally walked through streets of a town, with mourning, flagellation and wailing, ultimately to a local lake, river or ocean where all the Tazia would be immersed into water.\n\nLike Western passion plays, ta'zia dramas were originally performed outdoors at crossroads and other public places where large audiences could gather. Much like in Iranian performances, these performances in other countries also began taking place in the courtyards of inns and private homes, but eventually unique structures called takias (referred to as tekyehs in Persian Ta'zieh) were constructed for the specific purpose of staging the plays. Community cooperation was encouraged in the building and decoration of the takias, whether the funds for the enterprise were provided by an individual philanthropist or by contributions from the residents of its particular locality. The takias varied in size, from intimate structures which could only accommodate a few dozen spectators to large buildings capable of holding an audience of more than a thousand people. All takias, regardless of their size and geographic location, are constructed as theaters-in-the-round to intensify the dynamic between actors and audience. the spectators are literally surrounded by the action and often become physical participants in the play. In unwalled takias, it is not unusual for combat scenes to occur behind the audience.\n\n\n\n"}

It was published in \"Dealings with the Fairies\" (1867).\n\nIt is particularly noted for the intensity of the suggestive imagery, which implies a spiritual meaning to the story without providing a transparent allegory for the events in it.\n\nA young boy listens to his Great-aunt's stories about a magical golden key found at the end of a rainbow. One day, he sees an immense rainbow and sets out to find its end in an enchanted forest. As the forest is in Fairyland where everything has an opposite effect, the rainbow only glows brighter when the sun sets. He finds the key, then it dawns on him that he does not know where the lock is.\n\nIn the same village on the border of this forest, a merchant's neglected daughter is frightened by the fairies. Their first attempt fails but when they make her think the three bears are coming into her bedroom, she flees into the woods.\n\nA tree tries to trap her, but a feathered airborne fish frees her, then leads her to a wise woman's cottage. A pot is boiling there, and the air fish flies into it. The lady asks her name; the girl says that the servants always called her Tangle, and the lady decides that although her tangled hair was their fault for not looking after her, Tangle is a pretty name. She says she is called Grandmother, and that it has been three years since Tangle ran away from the \"bears\". She has the girl washed by fish and dresses her. Then they eat the air fish for dinner after the lady assures her that the air fish had voluntarily gone into the pot to be their food, and the cooking pot produces a little-winged figure, who flies off.\n\nThe lady sends another air fish after the young man at the foot of the rainbow. At supper the next day, the young man, Mossy, arrives. The lady tells Mossy that if he searches for the keyhole, he will find it, and sends Tangle with him.

His recurring subjects include literary and film noir, the Hollywood studio system and the American comics industry. De Haven is noted for his comics-themed novels, including the \"Derby Dugan\" trilogy and \"It's Superman\".\n\nDe Haven was born in Bayonne, New Jersey. He attended Catholic School, where he was a classmate of fellow author George R. R. Martin, though he notes that they weren't friends, even though Martin was an editor of the school newspaper where he was a cartoonist.\n\nDe Haven originally wanted to be cartoonist before attending college, but by the time he graduated from the university, he realized that he would never be a professional cartoonist, and considers the realization \"the First Great Disappointment Of My Life\". He received a Sociology degree from Rutgers University in 1971 and an MFA from Bowling Green State University in 1973.\n\nAn avid reader of comic books and graphic novels, De Haven considers himself a narrative writer, and considers the storytelling style of comics to have been a major influence on his writing since he was a child of almost six or seven.\n\nHe began teaching creative writing part-time at Hofstra University in 1981, before moving in 1987 to Rutgers to teach American Studies (including one of the first college courses on American comics) before relocating to Richmond, Virginia to become a full-time teacher.\n\nDe Haven is currently a full professor of Creative Writing at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia in the MFA program, and often teaches at least one American Studies course, including \"The Graphic Novel\", De Haven is also the co-creator with author Laura Browder of the VCU's First Novelist Award, honoring the best debut novel published during a calendar year. He is also a licensed private investigator. He considers himself a Democrat, and has been criticized for anti-Republican statements he has made over the years.\n\nThe author noted in an interview that he agreed with Robert Crumb's observation that the Thirties was the pinnacle of American culture. He also notes in the same interview that he finds truth to Art Spiegelman's statement \"that we are, for whatever reason, most nostalgic for the decade before the one we were born in\", as he was born in the Forties.\n\nAs a freelance journalist, he has written criticism for publications such as the \"New York Times Book Review\" and \"Entertainment Weekly\". De Haven’s novels include the \"Funny Paper\" trilogy (consisting of \"Funny Papers\" (1985), \"Derby Dugan’s Depression Funnies\" (1996) and \"Dugan Under Ground\" (2001)). The trilogy's storyline stretches from the beginnings of the newspaper comic strips in the 1890s to the 1970s.\n\nThe \"New York Times Book Review\" called the \"Derby\" books \"a mighty accomplishment: John Dos Passos’s U.S.A. trilogy for comic geeks.\" The Boston Globe hails the trilogy as a \"wild ride\" \n\nIn 2005, his novel \"It’s Superman\" reinvented the early years of the well-known superhero of the same name amidst the Great Depression. The author noted his initial apprehension when he was contacted by DC Comics in 1997 in regards to writing a novel about Superman: \"[S]hould I do a novel with a character that I don’t own? So I had to think about it, but I didn’t think about it very long, really. I just thought...this is too good to let go...they were giving me carte blanche.\" He states that his prior novels about comic strips are what prompted DC to contact him about writing the period piece. For the novel, he took as his inspiration the early Superman stories of the thirties through the fifties; wherein the hero is not fighting super-villains and Lex Luthor, but clearing slums in the New Deal era and expose corrupt politicians. De Haven says he was aiming for his hero to develop a social conscience during the Great Depression. He states in the interview that only real departure from the Superman that Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster originally created is that while their original hero lived in Cleveland, De Haven places his hero in the real \"Metropolis\" of New York.\n\nDe Haven's awards include a fellowship from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, and he has twice won fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. His novel, \"Depression Funnies\", received an American Book Award in 1997. \"Dugan Under Ground\" received the Library of Virginia Fiction Award (also called the Library of Virginia Literary Awards.\n\n\n"}

In Latin, \"vesica piscis\" literally means \"bladder of a fish\", reflecting the shape's resemblance to the conjoined dual air bladders (\"swim bladder\") found in most fish. In Italian, the shape's name is \"mandorla\" (\"almond\").\nThis figure appears in the first proposition of Euclid's \"Elements\", where it forms the first step in constructing an equilateral triangle using a compass and straightedge. The triangle has as its vertices the two disk centers and one of the two sharp corners of the vesica piscis.\n\nMathematically, the vesica piscis is a special case of a lens, the shape formed by the intersection of two disks.\n\nThe mathematical ratio of the height of the vesica piscis to the width across its center is the square root of 3, or 1.7320508... (since if straight lines are drawn connecting the centers of the two circles with each other and with the two points where the circles intersect, two equilateral triangles join along an edge). The ratios 265:153 = 1.7320261... and 1351:780 = 1.7320513... are two of a series of approximations to this value, each with the property that no better approximation can be obtained with smaller whole numbers. Archimedes of Syracuse, in his \"On the Measurement of the Circle\", uses these ratios as upper and lower bounds:\n\nformula_1\n\nThe area of the vesica piscis is formed by two equilateral triangles and four equal circular segments. In the drawing one triangle and one segment appear in blue.\n\nOne triangle and one segment form a sector of one sixth of the circle (60°).\nThe area of the sector is then: formula_2.\n\nSince the side of the equilateral triangle has length , its area is formula_3.\n\nThe area of the segment is the difference between those two areas:\nformula_4.\n\nBy summing the areas of two triangles and four segments, we obtain the area of the vesica piscis:\n\nThe two circles of the vesica piscis, or three circles forming in pairs three vesicae, are commonly used in Venn diagrams. Arcs of the same three circles can also be used to form the triquetra symbol, and the Reuleaux triangle.\n\nIn Christian art, some aureolas are in the shape of a vertically oriented vesica piscis, and the seals of ecclesiastical organizations can be enclosed within a vertically oriented vesica piscis (instead of the more usual circular enclosure). Also, the icthys symbol incorporates the vesica piscis shape.\n\nEcclesiastical heraldry of the Catholic Church appeared first in seals, nearly all vesica-shaped.\n\nThe cover of the Chalice Well in Glastonbury (Somerset, United Kingdom) depicts a stylized version of the vesica piscis design (see picture).\n\nThe vesica piscis has been used as a symbol within Freemasonry, most notably in the shapes of the collars worn by officiants of the Masonic rituals. It was also considered the proper shape for the enclosure of the seals of Masonic lodges.\n\nThe vesica piscis is also used as proportioning system in architecture, in particular Gothic architecture. The system was illustrated in Cesare Cesariano's Vitruvius (1521), which he called \"the rule of the German architects\".\n\nThe vesica piscis is a leitmotif of architect Carlo Scarpa and is used as a “viewing device” in Tomba Brion (Brion Cemetery) in San Vito d'Altivole, Italy.\n\n"}

It was created in 1925 and is among the first protected areas in Africa. In altitude, it ranges from in the Semliki River valley to in the Rwenzori Mountains. From north to south it extends about , largely along the international borders with Uganda and Rwanda in the east.\nIt covers an area of and is listed in the List of World Heritage in Danger since 1994.\n\nTwo active volcanoes are located in the park, Mount Nyiragongo and Nyamuragira.\nThey significantly shaped the national park's diverse habitats and wildlife. More than 3,000 faunal and floral species were recorded, of which more than 300 are endemic to the Albertine Rift including eastern gorilla (\"Gorilla beringei\") and golden monkey (\"Cercopithecus kandti\").\n\nIn the early 1920s, several proponents of the European conservation movement championed the idea of creating a protected area in northeastern Belgian Congo, among them Victor van Straelen, Jean Massart and Jean-Marie Derscheid. When Albert National Park was established in April 1925 as Africa’s first national park, it was conceived as a science-oriented nature reserve with the aim of studying and preserving wildlife and so-called ‘primitive’ hunter-gatherer African Pygmies. In 1926, Derscheid headed the first Belgian mission to cartograph Albert National Park, which encompassed an area of around the extinct volcanoes Mount Karisimbi and Mount Mikeno. The protected area was extended in 1929 by Virunga National Park, which encompassed the Virunga Mountains, parts of the Rutshuru Territory and the plains south of Lake Edward. Its initial size of was enlarged step by step in subsequent years. Indigenous people, foremost Hutus and Tutsis lost their traditional land rights in this process, and were evicted from the protected area.\n\nIn 1934, the \"Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo Belge\" was founded as the governing body for national parks in the Belgian Congo.\nBetween the early 1930s and 1961, several expeditions to Albert National Park were carried out by Belgian scientists, the second headed by Gaston-François de Witte. They studied and collected zoological specimens of wildlife for the \"Musée Royal d'Histoire Naturelle de Belgique\"; explored the ethnic groups in this area; studied volcanic activity, and fossils.\n\nIn the late 1950s, encroaching Tutsi herders and their cattle destroyed natural habitat inside the park up to an altitude of , threatening the food base of the park’s gorillas.\n\nLand laws were reformed in the 1960s after the country became independent, and the land declared property of the state, much to the disadvantage of local people. Illegal hunting inside protected areas increased.\nIn 1969, the two parks were merged under the name Virunga National Park and enlisted as UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979.\nSince the early 1990s, the protected area was impacted by political turmoil in the African Great Lakes region. Following the Rwandan genocide, thousands of refugees fled to the Kivu region and presence of military increased. The First and Second Congo Wars further destabilised the region. Anti-poaching patrols inside the park were obstructed, park personnel and wildlife killed. About 850,000 refugees lived around the national park in 1994. Up to 40,000 people entered the park daily in search of firewood and food, and deforested huge areas. In 1994, Virunga National Park was entered into the List of World Heritage in Danger.\nIn 1996, the national park was enlisted as a Ramsar site of international importance.\n\nIn 2005, the European Commission (EC) recommended a public-private partnership between the country’s government and the British non-governmental organisation African Conservation Fund. Latter organisation is responsible for park management since 2010; about 80% of management costs are subsidised by the EC. Park protection efforts were militarized in the following years to deter armed rebel groups and poachers from operating inside the park.\n\nIn 2011, the British company Soco International was granted a concession for extracting crude oil in the surroundings of and in large parts of the national park. Government officials supported exploration activities by Soco International mission members, whereas park management opposed. In the course of increasing tensions, the park's chief warden Emmanuel de Mérode was assailed in April 2014.\nFollowing international protests, the company stopped exploring activities and consented to refrain from starting similar operations in the vicinity of World Heritage sites.\n\nBy 2016, four hydropower dams were constructed that provide electricity to small businesses and benefit more than 200,000 rural people.\n\nAfter the Second Congo War was over, confrontations between park personnel and rebel groups continued; 80 park staff were killed between 1996 and 2003.\nSeveral armed rebel groups operate in the park, including Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and National Congress for the Defence of the People.\nLatter controlled the Mikeno sector of Virunga National Park between December 2006 and January 2009.\nThey generate income by levying fees from local people for protecting prohibited activities inside the national park like poaching and clandestine fishing, logging, producing and smuggling charcoal, but also through armed robberies and kidnapping. In 2010, the United Nations Security Council estimated that the charcoal trade represents an annual value of US$ 28–30 million. Clashes also occur between park personnel and Mai-Mai militias in illegal settlements.\n\nFive rangers were killed in August 2017 near Lake Edward in a militia attack. Five rangers and a driver were killed in April 2018.\nSince beginning of the armed conflict, armed groups killed 175 park rangers until April 2018.\nIn May 2018, three tourists were kidnapped.\nThe hostages were subsequently released unharmed. The park remains closed to visitors since June 2018.\n\nVirunga National Park is located in the Congo − Nile watershed area. Its northern sector encompasses part of the Semliki River basin, as well as savanna and montane forest of the Albertine Rift.\nIn altitude, this sector ranges from in the Puemba River valley to the highest peak of Mount Stanley at within . The national park’s central sector encompasses about two third of Lake Edward up to the international border with Uganda in the east. A narrow corridor of width along the lake’s western bank connects the northern and southern sectors of the national park. The southern sector stretches to the shores of Lake Kivu and encompasses Nyamulagira, Nyiragongo and Mikeno volcanoes with montane forests on their slopes.\n\nThe northern sector of Virunga National Park is contiguous with Uganda’s Semuliki and Rwenzori Mountains National Parks, and the central sector with Queen Elizabeth National Park.

{"id": "24581735", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24581735", "title": "War of the Languages", "text": "War of the Languages\n\nThe war of the languages (; \"Milhemet HaSafot\") was a heated debate in Ottoman Palestine over the language of instruction in the country's new Jewish schools. This \"language war\" was a cornerstone event in the history of the revival of the Hebrew language.\nIn 1913, the German Jewish aid agency \"\", which had maintained schools for Jewish immigrants in Palestine since 1905, sought to establish German as the language of instruction at the first technical high school, the Technikum, in Haifa (later, the Technion), which it was sponsoring. This sparked a public controversy between those who supported the use of German and those who believed that Hebrew should be the language spoken by the Jewish people in their homeland. The issue was not just ideological: until then, Hebrew was primarily a liturgical language and lacked modern technical terms.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "48640146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48640146", "title": "Youth in the Dominican Republic", "text": "Youth in the Dominican Republic\n\nYouth in the Dominican Republic constitutes just over 30% of the total population. The Dominican Republic's population at roughly eleven million people has grown tremendously with the help of the youth population. In 1960, the youth population was at 3.3 million, and by 2008, it had reached 9.5 million, with two thirds of them in urban areas of the country.\n\nThe Dominican Republic is considered a middle-income country, and thrives economically through tourism and telecommunications. Tourism is the single best revenue earner and over 25,000 youth are employed in this sector. Although tourism generates large revenues, some scholars and activists argue that the development of tourism has negative impacts on youth by keeping them from pursuing higher education.\n\nPrimary and secondary education are free to all citizens of the Dominican Republic. Higher education is free in the public sector, most notably at the Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo, which enrolls 44% of the total tertiary student population.\n\nThe Dominican Republic is the only country that has a youth-only secretariat. In 2000, the country approved its General Youth Law, which allocates a budget of 1% of the national budget for the youth secretariat. The General Youth Law helps with youth development programs that promote education and development. The country also has multiple governmental laws that protect minors younger than eighteen years old from being arrested, legally processed, and going to jail.\n\nYouth in the Dominican Republic face challenges to participating fully and positively in society. The Ministry of Youth and the General Youth Law of 2000 pinpoints Youth Civic Participation as an important part of promoting youth development and well-being. The General Youth Law has a national education-based policy that requires high school students to complete sixty hours of service as a prerequisite of graduation.\n\nThe Law for the System of Protection regulates the treatment of minors from birth to age 18. This law states that children under the age of 13 are not criminally liable, while youth ages 13–18 are. The electoral participation rate in the Dominican Republic is higher than the Latin America average, as over 77.3 percent indicated they had voted in the last election. Younger residents between the ages of 18-25 had a 29.2 percent voting rate, compared to 75.6 percent in the 26-35 year age range.\n\nYouth Civic Participation Programs attempt to foster youths' positive civic participation and reduce negative and illegal behaviors. Other programs are available to help youth obtain birth certificates and identity documents. As of 2006, there were 17,000 children and youth who have been issued birth certificates, allowing them to attend school and vote in elections.\n\nYouth in the Dominican Republic tend to distrust government officials and institutions because they feel exploited. They tend to fear the judicial process; afraid jail will hinder them from reaching adulthood. Young adults in the Dominican Republic say that they believe they have a negative image in society, but ultimately just want their voices heard by older members of the community.\n\nSome organizations that seek to empower young people with the specific intent that they will go out and further empower their communities are Fundacion Sur Adelante and the Callegjera-Action Educational Foundation. These organizations work with the youth population to mobilize them to become change agents. They also provide them with access to libraries, computers, and law services to allow them the awareness they need to better organize themselves for the future. There are also set policies that help youth improve their creative and innovative skills for the workforce and reducing barriers that could limit their access to the labor market. These policies are responsible for detecting and removing children from child labor, while also ensuring compliance with labor rights.\n\nYouth face difficulties when entering the labor market and have unemployment rates considerably higher than adults. In 2008, youth ages 10–24 represented 24% of the total labor force in the Dominican Republic, and 43% of the total unemployed population. Unemployment in the Dominican Republic appears to be in a slight but steady increase of 14.3 percent since 2010. An unbalanced market of supply and demand limits the number of jobs available to youth. Skill gaps prove to be another obstacle to the youth and jobs are too complex for youth just out of high school or college. The lack of counseling services available to youth often prohibit them from obtaining jobs.\n\nAgriculture is the primary source of employment for youth in rural areas while wholesale and retail trade is the primary source of employment for youth in urban areas. Over 75% of the youth labor force is concentrated in five activities: wholesale and retail trade, other services, manufacturing, hotels, bars and restaurants, and agriculture. Self-employment is also a popular option among all age groups in the Dominican Republic. It has increased from 34% in 1991 to about 43% in 2011, leading to a measured increase in familiarity and comfort when working. The labor force participation is lower among young women due to gender stereotypes, which causes them to rely on self-employment. In 2007, the average wage for women was 87% of the average wage for men.\n\nOne program available for youth trying to find employment is \"Quesqueya believes in you\" or NEO in the Dominican Republic, which is a program designed to increase job opportunities for low-income people, aged 15–29, living in urban areas of thirteen of the country's provinces. Another program available is Espacios para Emprender (EpE), which is designed to equip 14-17 year old adolescents with the strategies required to find a job or establish a micro-enterprise.\n\nWork and education, combined early in life, often burden youth. Some youth believe that relocating to a larger city would benefit them and provide more opportunity in the work force.\n\nIn 2011, poverty levels were around 40.4%, compared to 32% in 2000. The World Bank 2006 study conducted a study on youth violence in the Caribbean and the primary motivation identified for committing a crime was the desire to escape poverty. The scarcity of resources may push young people into unsustainable and dangerous survival activities often creating violent neighborhoods. In Latin America and the Caribbean, it is estimated that over 50% of the population between 12–24 years is at-risk in participating in illegal and dangerous activities.\n\nYouth in the Dominican Republic can find a sense of social support in gangs. Many youth experiencing poverty can be excluded by the wider Dominican society, and gangs are sometimes the only option of acceptance. In the 2012 Latin American Public Opinion Project survey, the Dominican Republic was ranked first of all the Latin American countries, as 48.6% of neighborhoods reported to being affected by gangs. Members of gangs often participate in drug use and fight out of boredom. For many young people, a gang is a social participation space, a system of values in which individual and group identities are affirmed through new communication codes and forms of authority that are different from those that exist in the world of formal institutions.\n\nEducation in the Dominican Republic is free and compulsory at the elementary level, and free but not mandatory at the secondary level. Basic education enrollment is 89%, while secondary education enrollment is lower at 50%, as some youth face different constraints to accessing education at this level. Around 55% of children and adolescents do not attend school because their right to enter the system is denied. This restricted access to education affects children who do not have documents, which includes children who were born in the country to undocumented Dominican parents and children of Haitian parents.\n\nMany Haitians migrate to the Dominican Republic increasing the youth population in the school systems. There was an increase of Haitians in the Dominican Republic after an earthquake struck the island in 2010, killing over 200,000 people.\n\nOvercrowding is one problem that schools face, especially in urban settings. In public schools with 500 students or more (accounting for 68% of total enrollment), the student-teacher ratio is 78:1 (clarify this). Teachers are not able to work with individual students. Youth spend almost ten years in school, but make progress very slowly because they have to repeat grades. 12.4% of youth repeat the first three grades in urban areas, while 7.7% repeat grades in rural areas. Nearly 25,000 youth ages 15–19 characterized themselves as unable to read or write. Teachers in the Dominican Republic may only understand around 40% of the material they are teaching.\n\nIn the Dominican Republic, the population ages 15–24 are documented as the healthiest age group. One issue in the health sector is sexual health. 15% of females and 24% of males ages 15–24 reported have their first sexual relation before age 15. The proportion of youth who have sex at a young age was inversely related to both education and income. Youth that were sexually active early in life had dropped out of school earlier that those who had waited to engage in sexual activity.\n\nFewer than half of the female population that were sexually active used contraception. Because of the limited use of contraception, the Dominican Republic has one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates outside the country of Africa. Females are more susceptible to HIV and AIDS given that they are more likely to engage in commercial sex work compared to males.\n\nThe Code for the System of Protection and Fundamental Rights of Children and Adolescents guarantees the rights to health and health services for children and adolescents. The General Law of Health ensures that these rights are preserved for youth, women, senior citizens, and the disabled.\n\n82% of males ages 15–19 and 73.5% of females reported having consumed alcohol sometime in the prior three months. Although the legal drinking age is eighteen, many young adults begin consuming before that.\n"}
