Adult adoption may be done for various reasons including: to establish intestate inheritance rights; to formalize a step-parent/step-child relationship or a foster parent/foster child relationship; or to restore the original legal relationship between adult adoptees and their natural families.\n\nIn Japan, adult adoption may be used in order to facilitate the continuance of a family business. This form of adoption is known as \"mukoyōshi\" (“son-in-law adoption”). Adult adoption may also be used in some jurisdictions by same-sex couples in order to establish inheritance rights.\n\nDepending on the laws of the jurisdiction, adult adoption may not be available as a legal option. In the United Kingdom, only children may be adopted. The \"Adoption and Children Act (2002)\" states, \"An application for an adoption order may only be made if the person to be adopted has not attained the age of 18 years on the date of the application.\"\n\nIn places where adult adoptions exist, it may or may not transfer filiation in addition to inheritance rights. For example, in Colorado, one can adopt an adult of age 21 or older for inheritance purposes, but filiation will remain unaffected. However, adoption of a person between the ages of 18 and 20 (inclusive) transfers both inheritance rights and filiation. \n\n\n"}

AALL's mission is to promote and enhance the value of law libraries to the legal and public communities, to foster the profession of law librarianship, and to provide leadership in the field of legal information and information policy.\"\nAALL was founded in 1906. The American Association of Law Libraries' vision is to be \n\"a thriving professional association whose members and libraries-whether physical or virtual legal information services-are recognized as critical to the success of their organizations and as central to society. AALL members possess the knowledge and skills to maintain effectiveness in a constantly changing legal environment. Since the ready availability of legal information is a necessary requirement for a just and democratic society, AALL and its members advocate and work toward fair and equitable access to authentic current and historic legal information, and educate and train library users to be knowledgeable and skilled legal information consumers.\" The first president of the AALL was Arthur James Small (1869-1937), who was elected at the association's formation on July 2, 1906. Small was a law librarian at the Iowa State Library, and it was his idea to create an organization separate from the American Library Association specifically for law librarianship. Small never graduated high school or attended college, yet he successfully served the Iowa State Library for over forty years.\n\nFrederick C. Hicks (1875-1956) was another early president who greatly contributed to the AALL's vision. Hicks was a law librarian at both Yale and Columbia. In 1919, Hicks was first elected president of the AALL. He served two terms as president, 1919-1920 and 1920-1921. In 1923, Hicks authored \"Materials and Methods of Legal Research\". Prior to the publication of this book, there were very few legal research texts keeping pace with the explosive growth in casebooks and legal literature. Hicks was also a major proponent of expanding the scope of the AALL's \"Law Library Journal\". Prior to Hicks's input, the \"Journal\" mostly served as a depository for AALL committee reports. Hicks believed an expanded \"Journal\" could cover multiple aspects of law librarianship, ranging from scholarly articles to industry news.\n\nThe first woman to be elected AALL president was Rosamond Parma (1884-1946). She served two terms from 1930 to 1932. Parma was also the first law librarian for the University of California, serving as director of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall library from 1911 to 1935. She also managed the \"California Law Review\".\n\nHarry Bitner (1916-2001), who served as president for 1963-1964, helped elevate the position of law librarian from an under-educated service position to today's highly skilled specialists. Bitner outlined his thoughts in a \"Law Library Journal\" essay titled \"The Educational Background of the University's Law Librarian\" where he advocated college, library school, and law school degrees for new law librarians. In 1953, Bitner, along with Miles O. Price, authored \"Effective Legal Research\". This work updated and advanced many of the themes first presented in Hick's \"Materials and Methods of Legal Research\". As president, Bitner was instrumental in establishing a permanent headquarters for the AALL.\n\nThe AALL and its members have a long history of proactively influencing policy initiatives in the legal information field. The 1970s were the beginning of the modern era of AALL advocacy. This decade saw the association helping to provide input and shape several important policy issues such as the 1975 Federal Trade Commission's \"Guides for the Law Book Industry\", the \"Copyright Act of 1976\", and the 1972 and 1978 amendments to Title 44 of the United States Code.\n\nIn 2013, AALL's Government Relations Office staff, along with local chapters and AALL members, held the first Local Advocate Lobby Day. This event consists of visits to House and Senate offices to raise the profile of information policy issues pertinent to the AALL.\n\nAALL took a strong position against the Federal Register Modernization Act (H.R. 4195; 113th Congress), a bill that would require the \"Federal Register\" to be published (e.g., by electronic means), rather than printed, and that documents in the \"Federal Register\" be made available for sale or distribution to the public in published form. AALL argued that the bill \"undermines\" citizens' \"right to be informed\" by making it more difficult for \"citizens to find their government's regulations.\" According to AALL, a survey they conducted \"revealed that members of the public, librarians, researchers, students, attorneys, and small business owners continue to rely on the print\" version of the \"Federal Register\". AALL also argued that the lack of print versions of the \"Federal Register\" and \"CFR\" would mean the 15 percent of Americans who don't use the internet would lose their access to that material.\n\nThe primary publication produced by AALL is the quarterly Law Library Journal. In 1907, Frederick W. Schenk made the recommendation for both a quarterly journal and index. The \"Law Library Journal\" has been the official publication of AALL since 1908 and contains scholarly articles on law, legal materials, legal research, and librarianship. The AALL also produces a monthly magazine, The \"AALL Spectrum\". Furthermore, the AALL was the first publisher of the \"Index to Legal Periodicals\", including it with the \"Law Library Journal\" beginning in 1908. Printing of the \"Index to Legal Periodicals\" was passed to the H.W. Wilson Company in April 1912, and the company assumed business management duties of the \"Index\" in 1914. The AALL publishes a monthly eNewsletter, as well as periodic eBriefings. Many current AALL publications, such as \"AALL Biennial Salary Survey\", \"AALL Price Index for Legal Publications\", and \"Guide to Fair Business Practices\" are focused on law librarianship advocacy. AALL also produces the \"Index to Foreign Legal Periodicals\", an index providing multilingual coverage of foreign, international, and comparative legal journals.\n\n\n"}

The term \"antiquarian\", in general, refers to antiquities and collectible items usually considered old and rare, usually in reference to books, but is not limited to books. The word antiquarian could also be used to describe a person who collects rare books or other antique items. \n\nTwo key figures who have written a great deal on the U.S. antiquarian book trade specifically are Leona Rostenberg (1908–2005) and Madeleine B. Stern (1912–2007), both of whom were also in the business of collecting and selling rare books. Other histories having covered the topic include Isaiah Thomas, writing in 1810 his \"History of printing in America\"; Henry Walcott Boynton’s \"Annals of American Bookselling, 1638-1850\", first published in 1932; Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt’s \"The Book in America: A History of the Making, the Selling, and the Collecting of Books in the United States\" (1939).\n\nThe antiquarian book trade has roots in Colonial America, and may be considered in the study of American history and literature, print culture, and book history. Antiquarian book fairs have long been an important aspect of the trade. Today, the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America (ABAA) is the primary organization of the trade in the United States. Other organizations include the Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing (SHARP). The Rare Book School at the University of Virginia is the premier institution for those seeking an advanced education in the field.\n\nThe beginnings of the antiquarian book trade can be traced to British North America, specifically Boston of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. There is no established date of when this business of book collecting actually begins, however Stern attributes the beginnings to John Dunton’s visit to Boston in 1686, in which he brought along numerous books from his native England. Printed materials and books however were already available in Boston, the first book shop having been opened in 1647 by Hezekiah Usher. The act of collecting and selling books as a form of business increases later in seventeenth century, with 1693 being the date of the earliest printed catalogue of books in the American colonies. \n\nEvents in Boston during the eighteenth century proved both difficult and advantageous for the antiquarian book trade. For example, a fire broke out in 1711 that consumed nearly every bookshop then in existence in Boston. In the next two decades antiquarian booksellers rebuilt and gradually began to thrive, with the presence of Harvard College, as well as a certain literary and educational milieu in Boston allowing the development of the antiquarian book trade.\n\nIn the later eighteenth century, the heart of the antiquarian trade shifted to Philadelphia and New York City, growing with an increasingly educated public and independence from Britain. With the movement of people westward bookselling spread, and soon, small cities like Cincinnati become known in the book trade. The trade spread to Richmond and New Orleans, then to Texas, St. Louis, Chicago, and eventually, following the gold rush, to California.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33917476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33917476", "title": "Assyrian continuity", "text": "Assyrian continuity\n\nAssyrian continuity is the claim by modern Assyrians and supporting academics that they are \"at root\" the direct descendants of the Semitic inhabitants who spoke originally Akkadian and later Imperial Aramaic of ancient Assyria, Babylonia and their immediate surrounds. Modern Assyrians are accepted to be an indigenous ethnic minority of modern Iraq, southeast Turkey, northeastern Syria and border areas of northwest Iran, a region that is roughly what was once ancient Assyria.\n\nThey are a Semitic-speaking people who still speak, read and write Akkadian-influenced Eastern Aramaic dialects. They are Christians, with most being members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Pentecostal Church, Assyrian Evangelical Church and Ancient Church of the East\n\nThere has been a contingent of contemporary Western scholars supporting Assyrian continuity, including Simo Parpola, Richard N. Frye, Mordechai Nisan, Tom Holland, H.W.F Saggs and Robert D. Biggs. Supporters of Assyrian continuity point to the continued existence of Assyria as a name for a geopolitical entity long after its empire fell and that Assyrian religion and Akkadian-Mesopotamian names persisted until the Christian period. There is a complete absence of evidence that the population of Assyria was wiped out of existence after its fall, the continual documented use of the term \"Assyrian\" and its derivatives, and that the Indo-European words \"Syria\", \"Syriac\" and \"Syrian\" derive from Assyria and Assyrian and for many centuries referred to only Assyrian.\n\nA major argument used by the promoters of Assyrian continuity is that \"Syrian\" and \"Syriac\", the names used in many languages to refer to Syriac Christians, are ultimately derived from \"Assyrian\". The terms \"Syrian\" and \"Syriac\" were also in past times used by deniers of continuity as a major reason for their position.\n\nHowever, the 21st century discovery of the Çineköy Inscription appears to conclusively prove the already largely prevailing position that the term \"Syria\" derives from the Assyrian term 𒀸𒋗𒁺 𐎹 Aššūrāyu. The Çineköy inscription is a Hieroglyphic Luwian-Phoenician bilingual, uncovered from Çineköy, Adana Province, Turkey (ancient Cilicia), dating to the 8th century BC. This Indo-European corruption of Assyrian was later adopted by the Seleucid Greeks from the late 4th century BC or early 3rd century BC and also then applied (or misapplied) to non-Assyrian peoples from the Levant, causing not only the true Assyrians (Syrians), but also the largely Aramean, Phoenician and Nabatean peoples of the Levant to be collectively called \"Syrians\" or \"Syriacs\" in the Greco-Roman world.\n\nIn Classical Greek usage, \"Syria\" and \"Assyria\" were used almost interchangeably. Herodotus's distinctions between the two in the 5th century BC were a notable early exception, Randolph Helm emphasizes that Herodotus \"never\" applied the term Syria to Mesopotamia, which he always called \"Assyria\", and used \"Syria\" to refer to inhabitants of the coastal Levant. While himself maintaining a distinction, Herodotus also claimed that \"those called \"Syrians\" by the Hellenes (Greeks) are called \"Assyrians\" by the barbarians (non-Greeks).\n\n'The Greek historian Thucydides reports that during the Peloponnesian wars (c. 410 BC) the Athenians intercepted a Persian who was carrying a message from the Great King to Sparta. The man was taken prisoner, brought to Athens, and the letters he was carrying were translated \"from the Assyrian language\", which of course was Aramaic.\n\nThe first century prior to the dawn of Christianity, the geographer Strabo (64 BC–21 AD) writes that whom historians (most likely Greek ones) call Syrian were actually Assyrian;\n\n\"When those who have written histories about the Syrian empire say that the Medes were overthrown by the Persians and the Syrians by the Medes, they mean by the Syrians no other people than those who built the royal palaces in Ninus (Nineveh); and of these Syrians, Ninus was the man who founded Ninus, in \"Aturia\" (Assyria) and his wife, Semiramis, was the woman who succeeded her husband... Now, the city of Ninus was wiped out immediately after the overthrow of the Syrians. It was much greater than Babylon, and was situated in the plain of Aturia.\" Although the mention of Ninus as having founded Assyria is inaccurate, as is the claim that Semiramis was his wife, the salient point in Strabo's statement is the recognition that the Greek term Syria historically meant Assyria. It was the Assyrian Empire, not the \"Syrian Empire\", that was overthrown by the Medes and built palaces in Ninevah. However, while this statement provides insight into how \"Syrian\" was used \"by the Greeks\" (supporting the \"lost a\" theory), claims that Syria and Assyria were considered synonymous \"to non-Greeks\", including Syrians themselves, as alleged by Herodotus, are cast in doubt considering his remark in \"Geographika\": \"Poseidonius (a celebrated polymath and native of Apamea, Syria) conjectures that the names of these nations also are akin; for, says he, \"the people whom we call Syrians are by the Syrians themselves called Arameans... for the people in Syria are Aramaeans\"\".\n\n\"Syria\" and \"Assyria\" were not fully distinguished by Greeks until they became better acquainted with the Near East. Under Macedonian rule after Syria's conquest by Alexander the Great, \"Syria\" was restricted to the land west of the Euphrates. While the Romans mostly corrected their usage as well they continued to conflate the term in some cases.\n\nFlavius Josephus, Roman Jewish historian writing in the 1st century AD describes the inhabitants of the state of Osroene as Assyrians. Osroene was a Syriac speaking state based around Edessa in Upper Mesopotamia, a key center of early Syriac Christianity. He also points out the Greek misapplication of the term \"Syrian\"; In referring to Aramea in the \"Antiquities of the Jews\", Josephus states that \"Aram had the Arameans, which the Greeks called Syrians.\"\n\nJustinus, the Roman historian wrote in 300 AD: \"The \"Assyrians\", who are afterwards called \"Syrians\", held their empire thirteen hundred years\".\n\nIn the 380s AD, the Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus during his travels in Upper Mesopotamia with Jovian states that; \"Within this circuit is Adiabene, which was formerly called Assyria;\" Ammianus Marcellinus also refers to an extant region still called Assyria located between the Tigris and Euphrates.\n\nMichael the Syrian mentions a 9th-century AD dispute between Jacobite Syrians with Greek scholars, in which the Jacobites claimed Assyrian continuity.\n\"That even if their name is now \"Syrian\", they are originally \"Assyrians\" and they have had many honourable kings... Syria is in the west of Euphrates, and its inhabitants who are talking our Aramaic language, and who are so-called \"Syrians\", are only a part of the \"all\" (the all meaning Aramaic speaking Christians), while the other part which was in the east of Euphrates, going to Persia, had many kings from Assyria and Babylon and Urhay... Assyrians, who were called \"Syrians\" by the Greeks, were also the same Assyrians, I mean \"Assyrians\" from \"Assur\" (Ashur) who built the city of Nineveh\"\n\nUnlike the later non-indigenous Indo-European languages, what is today the modern Syrian Arab Republic was always distinct from Assyria, and the Levant never held the name Syria/Assyria for over two thousand years of written history, only having the name bestowed upon it during the early part of the Seleucid Empire (312–150 BC).\n\nDuring the Akkadian Empire (2335–2154 BC), Neo-Sumerian Empire (2119–2004 BC) and Old Assyrian Empire (1975–1750 BC) and Babylonian Empire the region which is now Syria was called \"The Land of the Amurru\" and later \"Mitanni\", referring to the Amorites and the Hurrians who were the most prominent populations. During the Middle Assyrian Empire (1365-1020 BC), and continuing throughout the Neo Assyrian Empire (935-605 BC) and the succeeding Neo-Babylonian Empire (605–539 BC) and Achaemenid Empire, (539–323 BC) Syria was known as Aramea and later Eber Nari.\n\nThe 10th-century AD Arab scholar Ibn al-Nadim, while describing the books and scripture of many people defines the word \"Ashuriyun\" (Arabic for Assyrians) as \"a sect of Jesus\" inhabiting northern Mesopotamia.\n\nIn the mid-16th century AD, Pope Julius III initially named the church of converts from the Assyrian Church to Catholicism as \"The Church of Athura (Assyria) and Mosul\", and its first Patriarch Yohannan Sulaqa as \"Patriarch of the Eastern Assyrians\". This was later changed to \"The Chaldean Catholic Church\".\n\nDuring the 16th century AD, according to the \"Chronicle of the Carmelites in Persia\", Pope Paul V, in a letter to the Persian Shah Abbas I (1571–1629) of 3 November 1612 mentions that the Jacobites endorsed an \"Assyrian\" identity.\n\nSharaf Khan Al-Bedlissi, a 16th-century AD Kurdish historian mentions \"Asuri\" (Assyrians) as being extant in northern Mesopotamia\n\nPoutrus Nasri, an Egyptian theologian, claims that The Church of the East had many adherents who espoused an Assyrian identity during the Parthian and Sassanid periods.\n\nProponents of continuity such as Stephanie Dalley point out that as late as the 18th and 19th centuries, the region around Mosul was known as Athura by the native Christian population, which means \"Assyria\".\n\nAccording to Christian missionary Horatio Southgate, \"Syrian\" and \"Assyrian\" were self-identifications among Jacobites (Syriac Orthodox) he met in 1841, before the Ancient Assyrian sites were rediscovered by archaeologists in 1894:\n\"I began to make inquiries for the Syrians. The people informed me that there were about one hundred families of them in the town of Kharpout, and a village inhabited by them on the plain. I observed that the Armenians did not know them under the name which I used, \"Syriani\"; but called them \"Assouri\", which struck me the more at the moment from its resemblance to our English name \"Assyrians\", from whom they claim their origin, being sons, as they say, of Ashur who \"out of the land of Shinar went forth, and build Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resin between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.\" \n\nEnglist priest Henry Burgess, writing in the early 1850s, states that Upper Mesopotamia was known as Assyria/Athura by the Semitic Christian population of the region.\n\nA number of 19th-century Assyriologists such as Austen Henry Layard, the Assyrian archaeologist Hormuzd Rassam and the Anglican missionary and Orientalist George Percy Badger supported Assyrian continuity.\n\nE.B. Soane wrote in 1892, \"The Mosul people, especially the Christians are very proud of their city and the antiquity of its surroundings; the Christians, regard themselves as direct descendants of the great rulers of Assyria\".\n\nSidney Smith argued in 1926 that poor communities continued to perpetuate some basic Assyrian identity after the fall of the empire through to the present. Efram Yildiz echoes this view also.\n\nAnglican missionary, Rev. W. A. Wigram, in his book \"The Assyrians and Their Neighbours\" (1929), writes, \"The Assyrian stock, still resident in the provinces about the ruins of Nineveh, Mosul, Arbela, and Kirkuk, and seem to have been left to their own customs in the same way.\"\n\nR. S. Stafford in 1935 describes the Assyrians as descending from the Ancient Assyrians, surviving the various periods of foreign rule intact, and until World War I of having worn items of clothing much like the ancient Assyrians.\n\nSome Academics including John Joseph, largely reject the modern Assyrian claim of descent from the ancient Assyrians of Mesopotamia, and their succeeding the Sumero-Akkadians and the Babylonians as one continuous civilization.' He criticizes modern Assyrian writers who \"eager to establish a link between themselves and the ancient Assyrians, conclude that such a link is confirmed whenever they come across a reference to the word Assyrians during the early Christian period, to them it proves that their Christian ancestors always 'remembered' their Assyrian forefathers. Nationalist writers often refer to Tatian's statement that he was 'born in the land of the Assyrians', and note that the Acts of Mar Qardagh trace the martyr's ancestry to Ancient Assyrian kings\". He claims that while \"The name Assyrian was certainly used prior to the nineteenth century\", it \"was a well known name throughout the centuries and wherever the Bible was held holy, whether in the East or West,\" thanks to the Old Testament.\n\nAdam H. Becker of New York University disagrees with an Assyrian continuity and writes that the special continuity claims \"must be understood as a modern invention worthy of the study of a Benedict Anderson or an Eric Hobsbawm rather than an ancient historian.\" (both study the origins of invented traditions in nationalism) Becker describes Assyrians as a people he calls \"East Syrians\" in his writings.\n\nDavid Wilmshurst, a historian of the Church of the East, believes that Assyrian identity only emerged as a consequence of the earlier archaeological discovery of the ruins of Nineveh in 1845. Any continuity, he argues, is insignificant, if it exists at all.\n\nHowever, these arguments appear to be contradicted by the observations made by Horatio Southgate whilst travelling in northern Mesopotamia in the early 1840s in the period \"prior\" to these Assyrian archaeological discoveries show that the Armenians of southeastern Anatolia and northern Mesopotamia were at that period clearly using the term 'Assyrian' in preference to the term 'Syrian', and that the Assyrians in these regions clearly regarded themselves as Assyrians descendant from their ancient namesakes.\n\nAnother argument is based on the etymology of \"Syria\". The noted Iranologist Richard Nelson Frye supports ethnic continuity from ancient times to the present, arguing successfully that the term 'Syrian' originating from 'Assyrian' supports continuity, particularly when applied to the Semites in northern Mesopotamia and its surrounds. In a response to John Joseph, Frye writes \"I do not understand why Joseph and others ignore the evidence of Armenian, Arab and Persian sources in regard to usage with initial a-, including contemporary practice.\" Robert Rollinger also uses this line of argumentation to support continuity. Joseph was long skeptical about the initial a-theory, but has since been forced to accept it following the discovery of the Cinekoy Inscription which proved his assertions wrong. \n\nProminent Assyriologist H. W. F. Saggs in his \"The Might That Was Assyria\" points out that the Assyrian population was never wiped out, bred out or deported after the fall of its empire, and that after Christianisation the Assyrians have continued to keep alive their identity and heritage. However, Saggs disputes an extreme \"racial purity\", he points out that even at its mightiest, Assyria deported populations of Jews, Elamites, Arameans, Neo-Hittites, Urartians and others into Assyria, and that these peoples became \"Assyrianised\" and were absorbed and blended into the native population.\n\nAssyriologist J. A. Brinkman argues that there is absolutely no historical evidence or proof to suggest the population of Assyria was wiped out, bred out of existence or removed at any time following the destruction of its empire. He puts the burden of proof upon those arguing against continuity to prove their case with strong evidence. Brinkman goes on to mention that the gods of the Assyrian Pantheon were certainly still being worshiped even 900 years after the fall of the Assyrian Empire. He also indicated that Assur and Calah, among other cities, were prosperous and still occupied by Assyrians, which he claims indicates a continuity of Assyrian identity and culture well into the Syriac Christian period.\n\nJohn Curtis strongly disputes assumptions based on biblical interpretations that Assyria became an uninhabited wasteland after its fall, pointing out its wealth and influence during the various periods of Persian rule. It is known that Achaemenid Assyria flourished; and Assyrians soldiers were a remnant of Achaemenid armies, holding important civic positions, with their agriculture providing a breadbasket for the empire. Imperial Aramaic and Assyrian administrative practices were also retained by the Achaemenid kings In addition, it is known that a number of important Assyrian cities such as Arbela, Guzana and Harran survived intact, and others, such as Assur and Arrapha recovered from their previous destruction. For those cities that remained devastated, such as Nineveh and Calah, smaller towns were built nearby, such as Mepsila.\n\nGeorges Roux notes that Assyrian culture and national religion were alive into the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, with the city of Assur possibly being independent for a while in the 3rd century AD, and that the Neo-Assyrian kingdom of Adiabene was a virtual resurrection of Assyria, but emphasizes that \"the revived settlements [in ancient Assyria] had very little in common architecturally with their earlier precursors\". Roux also states however that, \"After the fall of Assyria, however, its actual name was gradually changed to 'Syria'; thus, in the Babylonian version of Darius I inscriptions, Eber-nari (\"across-the-river,\" i.e. Syria, Palestine and Phoenicia) corresponds to the Persian and Elamite Athura (Assyria); besides, in the Behistun inscription, Izalla, the region of Syria renowned for its wine, is assigned to Athura.\"\n\nRoux, as well as Saggs, note that a time came when Akkadian inscriptions were meaningless to the inhabitants of Assyria, and ceased to be spoken by the common people. Critics of Assyrianism take this same line of argumentation in explaining that, even though the Assyrians were not wiped out ethnically, their original culture changed.\n\nW. W. Tarn states also that Assyrians and their culture were still extant well into the Christian period.\n\nPatricia Crone and Michael Cook note that Assyrian consciousness did not die out after the fall of its empire, asserting that a major revival of Assyrian consciousness and culture took place between the 2nd century BC and 4th century AD.\n\nSome continuity-supporters, though not all, argue that Assyrian culture is continuous from ancient times until today. The Assyriologist Simo Parpola echoes Saggs, Brinkman and Biggs, says that there is strong evidence that Assyrian identity and culture continued after the fall of the Assyrian Empire. Parpola asserts that traditional Assyrian religion remained strong until the 3rd and 4th centuries AD, surviving among small communities of Assyrians up to at least the 10th century AD in Upper Mesopotamia, and as late as the 18th century AD in Mardin. Parpola asserts that the Neo-Assyrian Upper Mesopotamian kingdoms of Adiabene, Assur, Osrhoene, Beth Nuhadra, Beth Garmai and to some degree Hatra which existed between the 1st century BC and 5th century AD in Assyria, were distinctly Assyrian linguistically, as they wrote in the Syriac language, a dialect of Aramaic which began in geographic Assyria.\n\nSimilarly, J.B Segal argues that \"Although the Assyrian empire had fallen, the Assyrians continued to retain the Assyrian culture\" in Edessa, Urhay and Upper Mesopotamia, with gods such as Sin, Shamash, Ashur, Hadad and Ishtar of Nineveh being worshipped until Eastern Rite Christianity took hold. He also states that \"Within the Abgar dynasty, there were kings named Mannu, the Akkadian name that was found in the Assyrian inscriptions from the assyrian city of Tushan\" (southeastern Turkey).\n\nRobert D. Biggs supports genealogical/ethnic continuity without prejudicing cultural continuity, asserting that the modern Assyrians are the \"ethnic\" descendants of their ancient ancestors but became \"culturally\" different from them with the advent of Christianity. \"Especially in view of the very early establishment of Christianity in Assyria and its continuity to the present and the continuity of the population, I think there is every likelihood that ancient Assyrians are among the ancestors of modern Assyrians.\"\n\nBritish historian Tom Holland in an article in \"The Daily Telegraph\" of 2017 clearly links the modern Assyrians to the ancient Assyrians, stating that they are the Christianized ancestors of the ancient Assyrians.\n\nGeorge V Yana asserts that the Assyrians continue to exist to this day, and shared their culture with Aramaic speaking populations\n\nSilvio Zaorani differentiates between Levantine Aramean and Mesopotamian Assyrian populations, stating that; \"even if \"Syrian\" were derived from \"Assyrian\", it does not mean that the people and culture of \"geographical Syria\" are identical to those of \"geographical Assyria\".\"\n\nThe United Nations organization, Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) recognises Assyrians as the Indigenous people of northern Iraq.\n\nThe governments of Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey and Armenia recognise Assyrians as a distinct ethnic group.\n\nA series of modern Genetic Studies have shown that the modern Assyrians from Northern Iraq, Southeastern Turkey, Northwestern Iran and Northeastern Syria are in a genetic sense one homogenous people, \"regardless\" of which church they belong to (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic, Syriac Orthodox, Assyrian Protestant). Furthermore, their collective genetic profile differs from neighbouring Syrians, Levantine Syriac Christians, Kurds, Iranians, Arabs, Turks, Armenians, Jews, Yezidis, Shabakis, Greeks, Georgians, Circassians, Turcomans, Maronite Christians, Egyptians and Mandeans.\n\nLate 20th century DNA analysis conducted on Assyrian members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Orthodox Church by Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza, \"shows that Assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population.\" Genetic analysis of the Assyrians of Persia demonstrated that they were \"closed\" with little \"intermixture\" with the Muslim Persian population and that an individual Assyrian's genetic makeup is relatively close to that of the Assyrian population as a whole. Cavalli-Sforza \"et al.\" state in addition, \"[T]he Assyrians are a fairly homogeneous group of people, believed to originate from the land of old Assyria in northern Iraq\", and \"they are Christians and are probably bona fide descendants of their namesakes.\" \"The genetic data are compatible with historical data that religion played a major role in maintaining the Assyrian population's separate identity during the Christian era\".\n\nA 2008 study on the genetics of \"old ethnic groups in Mesopotamia,\" including 340 subjects from seven ethnic communities (Assyrian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, Armenian, Turkmen, Kurdish and Arab peoples of Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait) found that Assyrians were homogeneous with respect to all other ethnic groups sampled in the study, regardless of each Assyrians religious affiliation.\n\nA study by Dr Joel J. Elias found that Assyrians of \"all denominations\" were a homogenous group, and genetically distinct from all other Near Eastern ethnicities.\n\nIn a 2006 study of the Y-chromosome DNA of six regional populations, including, for comparison, Assyrians and Syrians, researchers found that \"the Semitic populations (Assyrians and Syrians) are very distinct from each other according to both [comparative] axes. This difference supported also by other methods of comparison points out the weak genetic affinity between the two populations with different historical destinies.\"\n\nIn 2008 Fox News in the United States ran a feature called \"Know your Roots\". As part of the feature, an Assyrian reporter, Nineveh Dinha was tested by GeneTree.com. Her DNA profile was traced back to the region of Harran in south-eastern Anatolia in 1400 BC, which was a part of ancient Assyria.\n\nIn a 2011 study focusing on the genetics of Marsh Arabs of Iraq, researchers identified Y chromosome haplotypes shared by Marsh Arabs, Arabic speaking Iraqis, Mandeans and Assyrians, \"supporting a common local background.\"\n\nMordechai Nisan, the Israeli Orientalist, also supports the view that Assyrians should be named specifically as such in an ethnic and national sense, are the descendants of their ancient namesakes, and denied self-expression for political, ethnic and religious reasons.\n\nDr. Arian Ishaya a historian and Anthropologist of UCLA states that the confusion of names applied to the Assyrians, and a denial of Assyrian identity and continuity, is on one hand borne out of 19th and early 20th century imperialistic, condescending and arrogant meddling by \"westerners\", rather than by historical fact, and on the other hand by long held Islamic, Arab, Kurdish, Turkish and Iranian policies, whose purpose is to, divide the Assyrian people along false lines and deny their singular identity, with the aim of preventing the Assyrians having any chance of unity, self-expression and potential statehood.\n\nNaum Elias Yaqub Palakh (better known as Naum Faiq), a 19th-century advocate of Assyrian nationalism from the Syriac Orthodox Church community in Diyarbakir, encouraged Assyrians to unite regardless of tribal and theological differences\n\nAshur Yousif, an Assyrian Protestant from the same region of south eastern Turkey as Faiq also espoused Assyrian unity during the early 20th century, stating that the Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic and Syriac Orthodox were one people, divided purely upon religious lines.\n\nFreydun Atturaya (Freydon Bet-Abram Atoraya) also advocated Assyrian unity and was a staunch supporter of Assyrian identity and nationalism and the formation of an ancestral Assyrian homeland in the wake of the Assyrian genocide.\n\nFarid Nazha an influential Syrian born Assyrian nationalist deeply criticised the leaders of the various churches followed by the Assyrian people, accusing the Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church of creating divisions among Assyrians, when their joint ethnic and national identity should be paramount.\n\nGeorge Habash, the founder of the Palestinian militant group PFLP asserts that the Assyrian people have been denied representation due to a betrayal by Western powers and by policy of deliberately denying their heritage and rights by Muslim Arab, Turkish, Iranian and Kurdish regimes.\n\nBy the 3rd century AD at the very latest, Akkadian was extinct, although some loaned vocabulary and grammatical features still survives in the Eastern Aramaic dialects of the Assyrians to this day.\n\nJ. A Brinkman theorises that the Aramaic language took over because of its simple alphabet and structure as opposed to the 600-700 syllables of the unwieldy Assyro-Babylonian language.\n\nAs linguist Geoffrey Khan points out that a number of vocabulary and grammatical features in the colloquial modern neo-Aramaic dialects spoken by the Assyrians shows similarities with the ancient Akkadian language, whereas significantly, the now near extinct Western Aramaic dialects of the Arameans (\"Oromoyo\"), Phoenicians, Nabateans, Jews and Levantine Syriacs of Syria and the Levant do not. This indicates that the Assyrian Eastern Aramaic dialects gradually replaced Akkadian among the Assyrian populace, and that they were both influenced by and overlaid the earlier Assyrian Akkadian tongue of the region, unlike Aramaic dialects spoken in the Levant.\n\nOne example is the use of the prefixed article k- or other variants of it such as ki- and či- which does not appear in classical Syriac. Evidence of the existence of an earlier language which differs from Classical Syriac can be found in other medieval texts such as an Arabic medical book that was composed by Ibn Baklarish in Spain. The book lists a number of medical elements in a variety of languages including one designated as \"al-suryāniyya\" which would presumably correspond with Syriac. The words listed under it are not Classical Syriac however, but correspond to forms found only in the modern Assyrian dialects spoken to the east of the Tigris.\n\nAnother distinguishing grammatical feature of modern Assyrian which differs from Syriac is the inflection of past verbs by a series of suffixes that contain the preposition \"l-\", e.g. \"grišle\" 'he pulled' and \"grišli\" 'I pulled' compared with the Syriac \"graš\" and \"gerešt\" respectively. The use of this suffix has been attested to Aramaic documents dating back to the 5th century B.C. This verbal form is originally a passive construction consisting of a passive participle and an agentive phrase. Examples of this passive construction has been later found in Mandaic and Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic and even in Syriac. All these forms of Aramaic are however far more frequently expressed by the active verbal form \"graš\", and the passive types are likely to be reflections of the contemporary spoken vernacular that have infiltrated the standard literary language.\n\nThere is also a number of Akkadian words mostly connected with agriculture that have been preserved in modern Syriac vernaculars. One example is the word \"miššara\" 'rice paddy field' which is a direct descendant of the Akkadian \"mušāru\". A number of words in the dialect of Bakhdida (Qaraqosh) shows the same origin, e.g. \"baxšimə\" 'storeroom (for grain)' from Akkadian \"bīt ḫašīmi\" 'storehouse' and \"raxiṣa\" 'pile of straw' from \"raḫīṣu\" 'pile of harvest produce'.\n\nSome grammatical features that are found in the modern Assyrian dialects are typologically more archaic than the corresponding features in classical Syriac. In the dialect of Qaraqosh, for example, the infinitive of all verbal stems does not have an initial \"m-\", by contrast with Syriac infinitives, which have acquired this prefix by analogy with the participles.\n\nSimo Parpola asserts that Eastern Aramaic had become so entrenched in Assyrian identity that the Greeks regarded the Imperial Aramaic of the Achaemenid Empire during the 5th and 4th centuries BC as \"The Assyrian Language\". During the 3rd century BC composition of the Septuagint, a translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek for the Hellenized Jewish community of Alexandria, \"Aramaic language\" was translated into \"Syrian tongue\", and \"Arameans\" into \"Syrians\".\n\nAmong Assyrians, numbers of fluent speakers range from approximately 600,000 to 1,000,000, with the main dialects being Assyrian Neo-Aramaic (250,000 speakers), Chaldean Neo-Aramaic (216,000 speakers) and Surayt/Turoyo (112,000 to 450,000 speakers), together with a number of smaller closely related dialects with no more than 10,000 speakers between them. Contrary to what their names suggest, these mutually intelligible dialects are \"not\" divided upon Assyrian Church of the East/Chaldean Catholic church/Syriac Orthodox church lines.\n\nOne of the main arguments against the continuity hypothesis is the scarcity of Assyrian and Mesopotamian (East Semitic) pagan personal names among the Assyrian Christian priests, bishops and other religious figures. This argument has been put forward by John Joseph, Jean Maurice Fiey and David Wilmshurst.\n\nDominican Syriac scholar J.-M. Fiey noted that while Eastern Christian writers wrote extensively about Assyrians and Babylonians, they did not identify with them. Fiey comments, 'I have made indices of my \"Assyrie chretienne\", and have had to align some 50 pages of proper names of people; there is not a single writer who has an 'Assyrian' name.' Wilmshurst comments, 'The names of thousands of Assyrian and Chaldean Catholic bishops, priests, deacons and scribes between the third and nineteenth centuries are known, and there is not a Sennacherib or Ashurbanipal among them.'\n\nDefenders of the continuity hypothesis have argued that it is usual and common for peoples to adopt \"Biblical names\" after undergoing \"Christianisation\", particularly as names such as \"Sennacherib\" and \"Ashurbanipal\" have clear pagan connotations, and thus unlikely to be used by Christian priests, and many were in fact throne names or eponyms. Fred Aprim has claimed that distinct Assyrian names continued in an unbroken line from ancient times to the present, giving examples of Assyrian personal names used as late as late as 238 AD.\n\nSimilarly, Odisho Gewargis explained the general scarcity of autochthonous personal names as a process taking place only after Christianization, when peoples generally replace native names with Biblical Names; giving as an example of this the scarcity of traditional \"English names\" such as \"Wolfstan\", \"Redwald\", \"Aethelred\", \"Offa\" and \"Wystan\" among modern Englishmen, compared to the commonality of \"non English biblical names\" such as John, Mark, David, Paul, Thomas, Daniel, Michael, Matthew, Benjamin, Elizabeth, Mary, Joanne, Josephine, Paula, Rebecca, Simone, Ruth etc. In response Jon Joseph strongly criticizes this argument as contradictory with Gewargis's other arguments, \"Contradicting himself, Mr. Gewargis notes that centuries ago, monks and ecclesiastics of the Eastern churches had 'great praise and exaltation for the Assyrians and their kings, their clergy and their judges and obvious downgrading of the prophets, clergy, kings and the elders of Israel. Thus one can say,' he concludes, that Sabhrisho, and monk Yaqqira and patriarch Ishoyabh 'were Assyrians filled with national pride.' We have here an unusual situation: 1. The Church fathers proudly calling themselves 'Aturaye'; 2. The common people, members of the church, for centuries calling themselves 'Suryaye'; 3. And Mr. Gewargis, an Aramaic-language expert who won't tell us the difference between these two Aramaic words, Aturaye and Suryaye.\" Many Old English personal names, such as Edward and Audrey, remain popular in England.\n\nKelly L. Ross notes that the oldest reference to the 'Christians' of Iraq is as \"Nestorians\", a term used by Cosmas Indicopleustes in 525 AD, though she acknowledges that this is a 'doctrinal' term and not an ethnic one. Hannibal Travis, in contrast, argues that \"Assyrian\" is the \"oldest\" name for this community, a majority opinion among modern scholars. Artur Boháč ehoes Hannibal Travis in arguing that the confusion of later names applied to the Assyrians were introduced by Western theologians and missionaries, and others arose out of doctrinal rather than ethnic divisions.\n\nAssyrians often reject the label of \"Nestorian\" even in a theological sense, the Assyrian Church both predating Nestorianism and being doctrinally distinct. Philip Hitti stated that it is an inaccurate term both chronologically and theologically and has no ethnic meaning.\n\nIn recent times, a small and mainly United States-based minority within the Chaldean Catholic Church have begun to espouse a separate Chaldean ethnic identity. They assert that they are a different and separate race to the modern Assyrians, and are the direct descendants of the Chaldeans of southeast Mesopotamia. This is only a minority viewpoint among Chaldean Catholics.\n\nChaldean Catholics were former members of the Assyrian Church of the East, who entered into communion with the Roman Catholic Church between the 16th and 18th centuries, after failing to gain acceptance into the Syriac Orthodox Church. Most Chaldo-Assyrian communities consider the term Chaldean to be purely doctrinal, the name of a church only, with no implication or meaning in an ethnic, cultural or historical sense. Acute Assyrian nationalism began shortly after the Assyrian Genocide in World War I, with Assyrian groups seeking a state of their own in the Assyrian homeland. Meanwhile, a \"Chaldean\" nationalism is largely non-existent, and if a Chaldean state were established it would not reasonably be in historic Chaldea which was in the extreme south east of Iraq, a different region to where the Chaldean Catholic church emerged.\n\nThe Chaldean Catholic Church was pointedly originally named the \"Church of Assyria and Mosul\" and its first leader \"Patriarch of the Eastern Assyrians\" circa 1550 AD, and was changed to distinguish its members from the Assyrian Church of the East in 1683 AD, with the modern Chaldean Catholic Church only coming into being in 1830 AD. Its founders and members were all from the Assyrian Homeland in northern Mesopotamia (what was Assyria), rather than the far south east of Mesopotamia where the Ancient Chaldeans migrated to in the 9th century BC, and where they also disappeared from history in the 6th century BC, and no link has been provided linking these people to the Chaldea or Chaldeans of old.\n\nIn an interview with Raphael I Bidawid, head of the Chaldean Catholic Church between 1989 and 2003, published in 2003, he commented on the Assyrian name dispute and distinguished between what is merely the name of a church and an actual ethnicity:\n\nProponents of a Chaldean continuity or separateness from Assyrians sometimes claim that they are separate because they speak Chaldean Neo Aramaic rather than Assyrian Neo Aramaic. However, both of these appellations are only 20th century labels applied by modern linguists to regions where one \"church\" was seen to be more prevalent than another for convenience, with no historical continuity or ethnic context implied in either. They are also wholly inaccurate; many speakers of Chaldean Neo Aramaic are in fact members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Assyrian Pentecostal, Evangelical Churches or Syriac Orthodox Church, and equally, many speakers of Assyrian Neo Aramaic are members of the Chaldean Catholic Church or Syriac Orthodox Church. This is also true of the Surayt/Turoyo dialect, and minority dialects such as Hértevin, Koy Sanjaq Surat, Bohtan Neo-Aramaic and Senaya. Furthermore, each of these dialects originated in Assyria, evolving from the 8th century BC Imperial Aramaic of the Assyrian Empire and 5th century BC Syriac of Achaemenid Assyria.\n\nThe term \"Chaldeans\" has been misapplied to other peoples with no link to ancient Chaldea, having been previously officially used by the Council of Florence in 1445 as a new name for a group of Greek Christians of Cyprus who entered in Full Communion with the Catholic Church. Rome followed to use the term \"Chaldeans\" to indicate the members of the Church of the East in Communion with Rome, mainly not to use the terms \"Assyrian\", \"Syrian\" and \"Nestorian\" that had connotations to theologically unacceptable doctrines. Rome had also long previously misapplied the name to Chaldia, a people and region in Anatolia, and The term \"Chaldean\" was also used in a similar generic fashion in the 10th century by Liutprand of Cremona.\n\n"}

The party had been established as a conservative political activist group in July 2016, as response to the results of the 2016 federal election. It was formed as a political party after Bernardi's resignation from the Liberals, following disagreements with the Liberal/National Coalition, its policies and leadership under Malcolm Turnbull. The Family First Party and their two state incumbents Dennis Hood and Robert Brokenshire joined and merged with the Australian Conservatives in April 2017. Brokenshire was not re-elected at the 2018 state election; Hood left the Conservatives to join the Liberal Party of Australia on 26 March 2018.\n\nThe Australian Conservatives were established by Senator Bernardi as a conservative political activist group on 6 July 2016. The group was announced by Bernardi on his personal blog as a conservative \"movement\" to \"help change politics and to give common sense a united voice\". Bernardi cited the results of the 2016 federal election as a motivator for the group's establishment, stating that \"over 1.7m votes were cast for right-of-centre or conservative parties rather than the Liberals\", and that \"the clear mission now is to bring people together for the good of the country.\" Despite contemporary media speculation when he created the group, following numerous public expressions of disappointment towards the Liberals, its policies, and leader Malcolm Turnbull, he stated that its establishment did not signal any breakaway from the Liberals, of which he was a Senator, and that its intent was to \"make the Liberals stronger\". Within a month, the group's online newsletter reached over 50,000 subscribers.\nQueensland Liberal National Party of Queensland MP George Christensen was one of the first Coalition members of Parliament to support Bernardi and the Australian Conservatives, following his shared dissatisfaction with the election results. Despite this, Bernardi hinted otherwise in the months following, often going against Coalition policy and criticising the government, in particular over the Racial Discrimination Act debate, especially 18C. In late December 2016, Bernardi held controversial meetings with members of the United States presidential campaign of Donald Trump, allegedly in preparation for forming a breakaway party after continued dissatisfaction with the party and its policies, While he refrained from commenting on renewed speculation that he would split, he was met with negative reception from fellow party colleagues, including former Prime Minister and Liberal leader Tony Abbott.\n\nOn 7 February 2017, Bernardi announced his resignation from the Liberals through a speech in the Senate, opting to advance the Australian Conservatives as a political party, and sit on the Senate crossbench as its leader. In his speech, Bernardi claimed that \"the level of public disenchantment with the major parties, the lack of confidence in our political process and the concern about the direction of our nation is very, very strong,\" and rationalised the creation of the Conservatives as a political party with the \"need to find a better way\". Bernardi also cited the resurgence and rise of conservative parties such as Pauline Hanson's One Nation as proof of such. Although dissatisfaction with the leadership of the Coalition was still shared by many in Parliament, numerous members have since denied any intention to join the Australian Conservatives, with most of them strongly criticising Bernardi — some described his move as a \"betrayal\". Tony Pasin, in particular, described Bernardi's move as unsurprising, \"given the way that conservatives from South Australia are treated by the leadership of the Liberals\".\nOn 7 April 2017, Kirralie Smith — a former candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance and a member of the Q Society of Australia and Senate candidate for New South Wales in 2016—joined the party. The Australian Liberty Alliance discussed the prospect of merging with the Australian Conservatives, but ultimately declined the offer. Australian Conservatives was registered as a political party with the Australian Electoral Commission on 12 April 2017. Later that month, the party formed a Senate voting bloc with the Liberal Democratic Party Senator David Leyonhjelm. The party issued a policy release in April, 2017 urging party members to petition major chocolate companies to oppose Easter Eggs being renamed Holiday Eggs. The release caused confusion on the grounds that there was no evidence any major chocolate company had ever done that in Australia, or that anyone had ever asked them to.\nIn May 2017, Bernardi met the national and Victorian state leadership of the Australian Christians to discuss a merger between the two parties. On 26 June 2017 it was revealed that Victorian MLC Rachel Carling-Jenkins was leaving the Democratic Labour Party to join the Australian Conservatives. The Democratic Labour Party declined an offer to merge with the Australian Conservatives. On 11 August 2017, former federal Liberal MP Dennis Jensen announced that he was defecting to the Australian Conservatives, and urged Liberal Party members in Western Australia to join him. In September 2017, the Victoria state leadership of the Australian Christians merged between the two parties.\n\nIn February 2018, Lyle Shelton (lobbyist) resigned from his lobbying position at Australian Christian Lobby to enter party politics, joining the Australian Conservatives as federal communications director. It has been speculated that he will be one of the party's candidates at the next federal election. Later that month, former One Nation Senator Fraser Anning joined the party's voting bloc in the Senate, but remained an independent Senator.\n\nOn 25 April 2017, it was announced that the Family First Party would merge with the Australian Conservatives, with its two members of the South Australian Legislative Council joining the party. Newly-appointed Family First senator Lucy Gichuhi did not join the Conservatives, and became an independent senator when Family First was disbanded. Gichuhi was invited to join the Australian Conservatives' voting bloc in the Senate, but ultimately chose to join the Liberal Party.\n\nFamily First was generally considered to be part of the Christian right. Though it had no formal affiliation with any particular religious organisation, Family First was strongly linked to the Pentecostal church in South Australia, and nationally with smaller Christian denominations. Family First in South Australia was viewed as an infusion of ex-Liberals via Robert Brokenshire and Bob Day. The party advocated a moral and family values agenda, but Day, who would become Family First's major donor, later reoriented Family First to emphasise issues such as industrial relations reform, free speech and smaller government, which brought Family First closer to Bernardi's Conservatives.\n\nHowever,according to John Macaulay, an executive of the Australian Conservatives Board, and the dissolution document of Family First, the Party did not merge with the Australian Conservtives. The Family First executive voted to dissolve the party, and in accordance with Australian law, they donated all their assets to the Australian Conservative Party. \n\nThe party made modest showings at the 2017 Bennelong and 2018 Batman by-elections, achieving primary vote of 4.29% and 6.41%, respectively, the latter in the absence of Liberal Party candidate, failing to elect a candidate in either instance. In March 2018, the party lost both upper house representatives in the South Australian Legislative Council, with the failure to reelect Robert Brokenshire, and the defection of parliamentary leader Dennis Hood to the Liberal Party, which nine days prior had won government in the state election. At the election, the Australian Conservatives suffered a −3.2% swing (from a Family First vote of 6.2% in 2014) for a lower house primary vote of 3.0%, and a −0.9% swing (from a Family First vote of 4.4% in 2014) for an upper house primary vote of 3.5%.\n\nFederal\n\nState\n\nThe Australian Conservatives' policies include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

These trade barriers may take the form of import or export taxes on products that have a large carbon footprint or are imported from countries with lax environmental regulations.\n\nThere has been debate on the role that increased international trade has played in increasing pollution. While some maintain that increases in pollution which result in both local environmental degradation and a global \"tragedy of the commons\" are intimately linked to increases in international trade, others have argued that as citizens become more affluent they'll also advocate for cleaner environments. According to a World Bank paper:\nProponents of environmental tariff implementation have highlighted that if implemented correctly, the tariff could serve to stop strategic behavior of foreign nations and return efficient economic policy in the foreign country. Additionally, environmental standards will be harmonized between the trading nations as a result of the environmental tariff.\n\nOne of the major issues that are raised when discussing environmental tariffs, is the issue of a reduction in trade. The argument raised is that tariffs reduce trade and may not actually be targeting the actual source of the pollution. They argue that pollution is not just as a result of imported goods but a large part of pollution suffered occurs within the borders of a country, therefore trade would merely harming trade without actually addressing the root cause effectively.\n\nAlthough the United States has in the past been accused of dragging its feet on implementing tough new anti-pollution measures, it was the originator of a legislative proposal suggesting an environmental tariff be applied against exporting countries whose exports gained significant cost advantages due to less stringent environmental regulations. The proposed legislation was tabled as the International Pollution Deterrence Act of 1991 and was introduced in its Senate in April of that year.\n\nNegotiations took place in 2001 Doha, Qatar towards the improvement of work related issues concerning the implementation of present agreements. This was a mandated conference dubbed the Fourth Ministerial Conference. One of the issues discussed concerned the issues of trade barriers on environmental goods and services. The result of which was ministers agreeing to a reduction or complete removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services such as catalytic converters and air filters to name a few.\n\nA notable feature of the proposed U.S. \"International Pollution Deterrence Act\" was the international pollution control index it cited within its Section 5, which read:INTERNATIONAL POLLUTION CONTROL INDEX\nSection 8002 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6982) is amended by adding the following new subsections at the end thereof:\n\nEnvironmental tariffs may result in the movement in production of goods to areas in which stricter environmental standards are enforced. Environment tariffs were not implemented in the past, in part, because they were not sanctioned by multilateral trade regimes such as the World Trade Organization and within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a fact which generated considerable criticism and calls for reform.\n\nMoreover, the GATT does condone the use of tariffs as market interventions, so long as the interventions do not discriminate products, both foreign and domestic. A disputed case relating to this policy was brought forth to the GATT/WTO, involving the U.S. and Canada over Canadian environmental regulations on beverage containers.\n\nAdditionally, many foreign factory owners in newly industrialized countries and underdeveloped countries saw the attempts to impose pollution controls on them as suspicious...\nMoreover, the problem of what the ideal tariff level is also a cause for concern when implementing environmental tariffs.\n\nFurther implementation problems have been as a result of what some developing nations may view as green protectionism.

Entrepreneurial leadership does this by employing leadership practices that \"develop the ability in employees to self-generate, self-reflect, and self-correct in their workplace\".\n\nEntrepreneurial leadership is effectively using the skills associated with successful individual entrepreneurs and applying those within the environment of a larger organisation. This especially means within an organisation where those skills have been lost and replaced with a \"corporate\" mindset that focuses on process, systems and risk minimisation rather than on entrepreneurial behaviour.\n\nOther definitions of entrepreneurial leadership have also emerged:\n\nAn entrepreneurial leader will proactively identify opportunities to gain advantage through creativity, innovation and market understanding and then hoion and the customer.j\n\nThe entrepreneurial leader will work within a formalised organisational structure, but use the approaches normally expected of an entrepreneur to identify opportunities. Once an opportunity has been identified, they work towards creating a value proposition which will enable a rapid testing of their key assumptions. Next to an effective management of risk (rather than the minimisation of risk often sought within corporate environments), they are required to operate with contextual awareness in order to create a value proposition that delivers value to the customer while taking into account the organisational requirements and strategic aims. The entrepreneurial leader must have the ability to learn fast and within environments of ambiguity and change, while providing clarity and coherence for those around them.\n\nThe entrepreneurial leader takes responsibility for their actions and those actions must be more proactive than reactive. They think about achieving organisational outcomes in an innovative way and working with a diverse group of people and resources to achieve these goals.\n\nPerhaps the best known and most widely considered example of an entrepreneurial leader is Steve Jobs, but there are many real life examples in the world of business and other industries, such as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson.\n\nThe search for the characteristics or traits of leaders has been ongoing for centuries. History's greatest philosophical writings from Plato's \"Republic\" to Plutarch's \"Lives\" have explored the question \"What qualities distinguish an individual as a leader?\". Underlying this search was the early recognition of the importance of leadership and the assumption that leadership is rooted in the characteristics that certain individuals possess. This idea that leadership is based on individual attributes is known as the \"trait theory of leadership\".\n\nThe concept of entrepreneurial leadership was introduced in 2000 by McGrath and MacMillan who suggested that in dynamic markets where there is increased uncertainty and competitive pressure a new type of leader is required. They described this as the \"entrepreneurial leader\". These fast changing markets or situations give those with an \"entrepreneurial\" approach the ability to exploit opportunities to gain advantage for their organisation faster than others.\n\nA number of organisations have sought to develop the concept of entrepreneurial leadership within the business world. A good example is UBS, the global bank, which in the period 2002 to 2006 proactively developed entrepreneurial leadership amongst its top 500 leaders. The success of this was demonstrated by improvements in individual, team and financial performance, the project becoming a key element in the Harvard Business School Case study, \"UBS Aligning the Integrated firm\". The bank was subsequently awarded the title Best Company for Leaders (Europe) 2005. The implementation of this project over a multi divisional bank spread globally was complex and took a number of years. This is reviewed in a case study by Chris Roebuck, Visiting Professor of Transformational Leadership at Cass Business School in London. Roebuck was one of the leaders of the team who implemented entrepreneurial leadership in UBS.\n\nThe principles of entrepreneurial leadership can be applied to a number of sectors and to a wide variety of organisations. The success of this approach has confirmed the compatibility of entrepreneurial leadership to the majority of organisations seeking to improve client/customer service and overall performance.\n\nProf Chris Roebuck notes that in recent examples of applying entrepreneurial leadership to organisations, the link to employee engagement has increasingly become as a key success factor. This has also allowed development of the concept of entrepreneurial support functions, such as Entrepreneurial HR and Entrepreneurial IT, to support the customer or client facing parts of organisations.\n\nEntrepreneurial Leadership is not so much a style of leadership as a focus of leadership and employees' efforts on specific actions that either maximise the effectiveness of service delivery currently or seek to improve it in the future.\n\nLeadership style refers to a leader's behavior. It is the result of the philosophy, personality, and experience of the leader. Rhetoric specialists have also developed models for understanding leadership (Robert Hariman, \"Political Style\", Philippe-Joseph Salazar, \"L'Hyperpolitique. Technologies politiques De La Domination\").\n\nThe democratic leadership style favors decision-making by the group. Such a leader gives instructions after consulting the group. They can win the cooperation of their group and can motivate them effectively and positively. The decisions of the democratic leader are not unilateral as with the autocrat because they arise from consultation with the group members and participation by them.\n\nUnder the autocratic leadership style, all decision-making powers are centralized in the leader, as with dictators.\n\nLeaders do not entertain any suggestions or initiatives from subordinates. The autocratic management has been successful as it provides strong motivation to the manager. It permits quick decision-making, as only one person decides for the whole group and keeps each decision to him/herself until he/she feels it needs to be shared with the rest of the group.\n"}

{"id": "617121", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617121", "title": "Game semantics", "text": "Game semantics\n\nGame semantics (, translated as \"dialogical logic\") is an approach to formal semantics that grounds the concepts of truth or validity on game-theoretic concepts, such as the existence of a winning strategy for a player, somewhat resembling Socratic dialogues or medieval theory of Obligationes.\n\nIn the late 1950s Paul Lorenzen was the first to introduce a game semantics for logic, and it was further developed by Kuno Lorenz. At almost the same time as Lorenzen, Jaakko Hintikka developed a model-theoretical approach known in the literature as \"GTS\". Since then, a number of different game semantics have been studied in logic.\n\nShahid Rahman (Lille) and collaborators developed \"dialogic\" into a general framework for the study of logical and philosophical issues related to logical pluralism. Beginning 1994 this triggered a kind of renaissance with lasting consequences. This new philosophical impulse experienced a parallel renewal in the fields of theoretical computer science, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence and the formal semantics of programming languages, for instance the work of Johan van Benthem and collaborators in Amsterdam who looked thoroughly at the interface between logic and games, and Hanno Nickau who addressed the full abstraction problem in programming languages by means of games. New results in linear logic by J-Y. Girard in the interfaces between mathematical game theory and logic on one hand and argumentation theory and logic on the other hand resulted in the work of many others, including S. Abramsky, J. van Benthem, A. Blass, D. Gabbay, M. Hyland, W. Hodges, R. Jagadeesan, G. Japaridze, E. Krabbe, L. Ong, H. Prakken, G. Sandu D. Walton, and J. Woods who placed game semantics at the center of a new concept in logic in which logic is understood as a dynamic instrument of inference.\n\nThe simplest application of game semantics is to propositional logic. Each formula of this language is interpreted as a game between two players, known as the \"Verifier\" and the \"Falsifier\". The Verifier is given \"ownership\" of all the disjunctions in the formula, and the Falsifier is likewise given ownership of all the conjunctions. Each move of the game consists of allowing the owner of the dominant connective to pick one of its branches; play will then continue in that subformula, with whichever player controls its dominant connective making the next move. Play ends when a primitive proposition has been so chosen by the two players; at this point the Verifier is deemed the winner if the resulting proposition is true, and the Falsifier is deemed the winner if it is false. The original formula will be considered true precisely when the Verifier has a winning strategy, while it will be false whenever the Falsifier has the winning strategy.\n\nIf the formula contains negations or implications, other, more complicated, techniques may be used. For example, a negation should be true if the thing negated is false, so it must have the effect of interchanging the roles of the two players.\n\nMore generally, game semantics may be applied to predicate logic; the new rules allow a dominant quantifier to be removed by its \"owner\" (the Verifier for existential quantifiers and the Falsifier for universal quantifiers) and its bound variable replaced at all occurrences by an object of the owner's choosing, drawn from the domain of quantification. Note that a single counterexample falsifies a universally quantified statement, and a single example suffices to verify an existentially quantified one. Assuming the axiom of choice, the game-theoretical semantics for classical first-order logic agree with the usual model-based (Tarskian) semantics. For classical first-order logic the winning strategy for the verifier essentially consists of finding adequate Skolem functions and witnesses. For example, if \"S\" denotes formula_1 then an equisatisfiable statement for \"S\" is formula_2. The Skolem function \"f\" (if it exists) actually codifies a winning strategy for the verifier of \"S\" by returning a witness for the existential sub-formula for every choice of \"x\" the falsifier might make.\n\nThe above definition was first formulated by Jaakko Hintikka as part of his GTS interpretation. The original version of game semantics for classical (and intuitionistic) logic due to Paul Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz was not defined in terms of models but of winning strategies over \"formal dialogues\" (P. Lorenzen, K. Lorenz 1978, S. Rahman and L. Keiff 2005). Shahid Rahman and Tero Tulenheimo developed an algorithm to convert GTS-winning strategies for classical logic into the dialogical winning strategies and vice versa.\n\nFor most common logics, including the ones above, the games that arise from them have perfect information—that is, the two players always know the truth values of each primitive, and are aware of all preceding moves in the game. However, with the advent of game semantics, logics, such as the independence-friendly logic of Hintikka and Sandu, with a natural semantics in terms of games of imperfect information have been proposed.\n\nThe primary motivation for Lorenzen and Kuno Lorenz was to find a game-theoretic (their term was \"dialogical\" \"Dialogische Logik\") semantics for intuitionistic logic. Andreas Blass was the first to point out connections between game semantics and linear logic. This line was further developed by Samson Abramsky, Radhakrishnan Jagadeesan, Pasquale Malacaria and independently Martin Hyland and Luke Ong, who placed special emphasis on compositionality, i.e. the definition of strategies inductively on the syntax. Using game semantics, the authors mentioned above have solved the long-standing problem of defining a fully abstract model for the programming language PCF. Consequently, game semantics has led to fully abstract semantic models for a variety of programming languages and, to new semantic-directed methods of software verification by software model checking.\n\nShahid Rahman and Helge Rückert extended the dialogical approach to the study of several non-classical logics such as modal logic, relevance logic, free logic and connexive logic. Recently, Rahman and collaborators developed the dialogical approach into a general framework aimed at the discussion of logical pluralism.\n\nFoundational considerations of game semantics have been more emphasised by Jaakko Hintikka and Gabriel Sandu, especially for independence-friendly logic (IF logic, more recently \"information\"-friendly logic), a logic with branching quantifiers. It was thought that the principle of compositionality fails for these logics, so that a Tarskian truth definition could not provide a suitable semantics. To get around this problem, the quantifiers were given a game-theoretic meaning. Specifically, the approach is the same as in classical propositional logic, except that the players do not always have perfect information about previous moves by the other player. Wilfrid Hodges has proposed a compositional semantics and proved it equivalent to game semantics for IF-logics.\n\nJaparidze’s computability logic is a game-semantical approach to logic in an extreme sense, treating games as targets to be serviced by logic rather than as technical or foundational means for studying or justifying logic. Its starting philosophical point is that logic is meant to be a universal, general-utility intellectual tool for ‘navigating the real world’ and, as such, it should be construed semantically rather than syntactically, because it is semantics that serves as a bridge between real world and otherwise meaningless formal systems (syntax). Syntax is thus secondary, interesting only as much as it services the underlying semantics. From this standpoint, Japaridze has repeatedly criticized the often followed practice of adjusting semantics to some already existing target syntactic constructions, with Lorenzen’s approach to intuitionistic logic being an example. This line of thought then proceeds to argue that the semantics, in turn, should be a game semantics, because games “offer the most comprehensive, coherent, natural, adequate and convenient mathematical models for the very essence of all ‘navigational’ activities of agents: their interactions with the surrounding world”. Accordingly, the logic-building paradigm adopted by computability logic is to identify the most natural and basic operations on games, treat those operators as logical operations, and then look for sound and complete axiomatizations of the sets of game-semantically valid formulas. On this path a host of familiar or unfamiliar logical operators have emerged in the open-ended language of computability logic, with several sorts of negations, conjunctions, disjunctions, implications, quantifiers and modalities. \n\nGames are played between two agents: a machine and its environment, where the machine is required to follow only effective strategies. This way, games are seen as interactive computational problems, and the machine’s winning strategies for them as solutions to those problems. It has been established that computability logic is robust with respect to reasonable variations in the complexity of allowed strategies, which can be brought down as low as logarithmic space and polynomial time (one does not imply the other in interactive computations) without affecting the logic. All this explains the name “computability logic” and determines applicability in various areas of computer science. Classical logic, independence-friendly logic and certain extensions of linear and intuitionistic logics turn out to be special fragments of computability logic, obtained merely by disallowing certain groups of operators or atoms.\n\n\n\n\n"}

With a length of , the route runs from Hanau in central Germany to Bremen in the north. Tourist attractions along the route are focused around the brothers Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, including locations where they lived and worked at various stages in their life, as well as regions which are linked to the fairy tales found in the Grimm collection, such as The Town Musicians of Bremen. The \"Verein Deutsche Märchenstraße\" society, headquartered in the city of Kassel, is responsible for the route, which travellers can recognize with the help of road signs depicting the heart-shaped head of a pretty, fairylike creature.\n\nThe German Fairy Tale Route passes through various scenic regions, which include eight nature parks including the Hessian Spessart Nature Park, Hoher Vogelsberg Nature Park, Kellerwald-Edersee Nature Park, Meißner-Kaufungen Forest Nature Park, Habichtswald Nature Park and the Weser Uplands Nature Park.\nThe towns and cities associated with the Brothers Grimm and located along the route are Hanau, Steinau, Marburg and Kassel. The original \"Children’s and Household Tales\" (German: \"Kinder- und Hausmärchen\"), edited and published by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in 1812 and known today as \"Grimm’s Fairy Tales\" (German: \"Grimms Märchen\"), can be found in Kassel. In 2005, this collection was added to the UNESCO World Document Heritage List. Several places along the Fairy Tale Route are connected with the fairy tales themselves. In the town of Alsfeld, visitors can see what is known as the House of Little Red Riding Hood (\"Rotkäppchenhaus\"); the spa Bad Wildungen offers a Snow White Museum (\"Schneewittchen Museum\"); and Dorothea Viehmann, from whom the Grimms learned about many of the fairy tales found in their collection, was born in what today is the community of Baunatal. According to legend, the hill Hoher Meissner is where Mother Hulda is said to have resided; Sababurg Castle, located in Reinhardswald Park, is referred to as the Sleeping Beauty Castle. Further attractions include the town of Hamelin, of Pied Piper fame; the spa of Bad Oeynhausen, which has a museum devoted to fairy tales and local legends (\"Deutsches Märchen- und Wesersagenmuseum\"); and the city of Bremen, which is famous for the tale of the Town Musicians of Bremen.\n\nNumerous picturesque medieval towns can be found among the Route's attractions as well. In 1975, the Council of Europe awarded Alsfeld the status of a model European community for the conservation of historic buildings. The old centre of the town of Hann. Münden comprises roughly 700 half-timbered houses; the 1300-year-old town of Fritzlar is famous for its imperial cathedral; and Hamelin contains beautiful examples of Weser Renaissance architecture.\n\nThe baroque grounds of Philippsruhe Castle in Hanau, the fountain displays in the Hillside Park of Kassel-Wilhelmshöhe, as well as the Bremen Town Hall with the adjacent statue of Roland (both of which are on the UNESCO World Heritage List) are also of particular interest. The 200th anniversary of the first publication of Children's and Household Tales by the Brothers Grimm was observed in 2012-2013 with a series of events. Many other events, open-air festivals, exhibits, and performances dealing with the topic of fairy tales are held annually.\n\nThe German Fairy-Tale Route runs from south to north and passes the following places of interest:\n\nBetween Kassel and Fürstenberg, the Route offers two alternatives:\n\n\n\nTo the north of Fürstenberg, the Route’s two forks rejoin:\n\n\n Hamelin 2011. \n\nPlaces along the route:\n"}

A light novel was published by Nitroplus titled \"Guilty Crown: Princess of Deadpool\" in April 2012. A spin-off visual novel named \"Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas\" was also developed by Nitroplus which came bundled with a 15-minute original video animation (OVA) named \"Guilty Crown: Lost Christmas\".\n\nBefore the events of the main story, on December 24, 2029, a biological hazard known as the Apocalypse Virus brought on by an impact event plunges Japan into a state of chaos. This event is later named the Lost Christmas incident. Unable to contain the threat, Japan sought international help and the United Nations dispatches an organization known as the GHQ to their aid. The GHQ successfully contains the outbreak and restores a level of normalcy at the cost of Japan's independence. Ten years later, a resistance organization known as the Funeral Parlor wages a campaign against the GHQ to liberate Japan once more.\n\nHigh school student Shu Ouma encounters a wounded girl named Inori Yuzuriha, the vocalist of a popular internet group Egoist, taking refuge at his film club's workshop. The GHQ Anti Bodies storm the workshop and arrest her for involvement with Funeral Parlor. Shu follows the coordinates of Inori's robot to a drop zone where he meets Funeral Parlor's leader, Gai Tsutsugami, who asks him to safeguard a vial. As GHQ begins attacking the Ruppongi area looking for the vial, it shatters as Shu goes to rescue Inori when she becomes threatened by GHQ Endlave mechs. The vial contains the Void Genome, a powerful genetic weapon derived from the Apocalypse Virus that grants Shu the \"Power of the King\", an ability that allows his right hand to extract Voids, weapons of people's psyche given physical form. Shu then extracts Inori's Void and destroys the attacking Endlaves.\n\nEventually, Shu falls in love with Inori and reluctantly joins Funeral Parlor. During one operation, Inori is taken by a boy named Yuu, who possesses the second Void Genome. Shu's repressed memories return to him, revealing his sister Mana had been the first to be infected with the Apocalypse Virus years earlier and caused a massive explosion which spread the Apocalypse Virus across Japan: the Lost Christmas. Inori was created to hold Mana's soul to create a new race of humans after the Apocalypse Virus annihilates the current human population. Gai and Shu work together and Shu stabs Mana's stasis pod, knowingly killing Gai in the process.\n\nTwo weeks later, the GHQ seals off the area surrounding Roppongi in Tokyo, now called Loop 7, leaving a large number of teenagers to take refuge at Tennouzu High School along with Funeral Parlor members Shu, Inori, Ayase and Tsugumi. With food and Apocalypse Vaccine supplies running low, Shu is elected the new student council president and eventually becomes a tyrant, after Hare's death. Shu and the others eventually break out of Loop 7, though in the process a resurrected Gai appears and severs Shu's right arm, transferring the Void Genome to him.\n\nGai protects Japan from being destroyed by the United Nations in an attempt to stop of the Apocalypse Virus. The mastermind behind the events in Japan is an ancient organization known as \"Daath\" whose purpose was to obtain Shu's power and Inori. Inori later lets herself get captured by Daath in order to protect Shu. Haruka Ouma, Shu's stepmother, betrays the GHQ and steals the third Void Genome which Shu later injects himself with. As events progress, Gai intends to cause the Lost Christmas event on a global scale. Funeral Parlor surrounds GHQ Headquarters at Tokyo Bay and attack. The Apocalypse Virus begins spreading across the planet from the GHQ Tower.\n\nShu defeats Gai who explains that the only way to stop the Fourth Apocalypse was to let Mana fulfill her destiny of starting it, after which she would finally be able to rest in peace, which is why he aided Daath. Gai then dies with Mana as the Virus envelops them both. Shu embraces Inori and activates his Void, absorbing everyone's Voids and taking all of the Apocalypse Virus onto himself. As he is about to be consumed, Inori sacrifices her own life to the virus, saving Shu. With the virus finally eradicated, the GHQ Tower collapses and everyone escapes. Some years later, Ayase, Tsugumi, Yahiro, Kanon, Souta and a now blind Shu celebrate Hare's birthday in a rebuilt Tokyo.\n\nIn the making of the series, the staff wanted to make \"the next generation of anime with this show.\" For this they wanted it to be an original anime rather than an adaptation. The staff also wanted it to be a \"two-season show\" regardless of possible difficulties. The basic concept of the show is in a \"Japanese style, a Japanese concept, and that is what makes it more original than other shows.\" When asked about similarities between Shu and \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\"s lead Shinji Ikari, the staff answered they are both passive characters although they found Shinji more passive.\n\nWhen asked what circumstances led to his involvement, Redjuice responded that the production staff's illustrators and animators felt that his concept art exhibited a sense of compatibility with the final product. While Ryo of Supercell was providing the insert songs for the show, Redjuice himself was not participating in the project as a member of Supercell. Besides liking Inori, the main heroine of \"Guilty Crown\", Redjuice stated that he had done many drawings of Tsugumi. The staff had no qualms with the cat-like ears of Tsugumi so Redjuice feels that he has slipped his personal tastes into the series. Redjuice also likes Kanon although she was not originally written into the scenario. As Redjuice has not worked with 3D CG much, he was able to learn a lot from the staff at Production I.G.\n\nThe music used in the \"Guilty Crown\" anime is composed by Hiroyuki Sawano. Both the opening and ending themes of \"Guilty Crown\" are written by Supercell. The first opening theme is titled \"My Dearest\" and is performed by Koeda. The CD single for \"My Dearest\" was released on November 23, 2011. The first ending theme is titled and is performed by Egoist, a fictional band from the series. The single for \"Departures (Anata ni Okuru Ai no Uta)\" was released on November 30, 2011. A 17-year-old artist named Chelly provided the vocals. Chelly was picked by Ryo of Supercell after an audition of 2,000 candidates. Chelly also sang the insert songs in \"Guilty Crown\". The second opening theme is \"The Everlasting Guilty Crown\" by Egoist and the second ending theme is by Supercell.\n\n\"Guilty Crown\" was directed by Tetsuro Araki with the series' script supervision being handled by Hiroyuki Yoshino and assisted by Ichirō Ōkouchi. Jin Hanegaya from Nitroplus will also be assisting with the screenplay. The mechanical designs were done by Atsushi Takeuchi and prop designs handled by Yō Moriyama. The original character designs were drawn by Redjuice, with Hiromi Katō providing the character designs for the anime. Yusuke Takeda was the anime's art director. The animation production was done by Production I.G's Division 6.\n\nAn Internet radio show named \"Guilty Crown Radio Council\" to promote \"Guilty Crown\" began airing every other Friday starting on October 7, 2011. The show is hosted by Yūki Kaji, the voice actor of Shu Ouma, and Ai Kayano, the voice actress of Inori Yuzuriha.\n\nNew York Anime Festival screened the first two episodes of \"Guilty Crown\" on October 15, 2011. The screening of the second episode was a world premiere as the episode did not air in Japan until October 20, 2011. At Anime Weekend Atlanta 2011, Funimation announced that it would simulcast the series in October, followed by a DVD and Blu-ray release in 2012.\n\nA manga adaptation titled \"Guilty Crown\", written by Yōsuke Miyagi and illustrated by Shion Mizuki, was serialized in Square Enix's \"Monthly Shōnen Gangan\" between the November 2011 and December 2013 issues. Square Enix released seven \"tankōbon\" volumes between January 21, 2012 and December 21, 2013. A second manga titled \"Guilty Crown: Dancing Endlaves\", written by Gan Sunaaku and illustrated by Ryōsuke Fukai, was serialized in ASCII Media Works' \"Dengeki G's Magazine\" between the July 2012 and May 2014 issues. Three volumes were released between January 26, 2013 and May 27, 2014.\n\nA side story novel titled \"Guilty Crown: Princess of Deadpool\" was written by Gan Sunaaku from Nitroplus, with illustrations done by a Production I.G and Nitroplus collaboration. A special version that came along with a special book cover was first sold at Anime Contents Expo 2012 in between March 31 and April 1, while the official release was on April 25. The first chapter was put up for public reading.\n\nNitroplus developed a spin-off visual novel named . The visual novel was previously known as \"Lost X\". The scenario writer for this game is Jin Hanegaya, who also penned \"Demonbane\". The game focuses on the \"Lost Christmas\" incident. The full version of the game includes a short 10-minute anime.\n\nThe series received mixed critical reaction. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network commended the series' bravery on reinventing its plot but described the plot as jumbled and continued the trend of weak characters and clichés. Aiden Foote of THEM Anime Reviews agreed with Kimlinger on the presentation and plot and added that the characters are unsympathetic with back stories that do not add depth to them. On the other hand, Foote remarks the aesthetics and the musical appeal, stating that \"Guilty Crown is its own jewel in terms of music, visual flare and design from the characters to the setting, to the set pieces.\" Chris Beveridge from The Fandom Post commented \"While it goes big and throws a lot at us, the end result that defines the rest of the season is one that works fantastically well for me because it introduces radical change into the series.\" He praised Shu's character development as well as the setting chosen for its second half.\n\nDVD Talk's Kyle Mills gave the series more praise, noting that despite small criticism \"the 1st 11 episodes of the series are great.\" He praised the story and setting but criticized the development of certain characters comparing them to \"flaws\" \"Gurren Lagann\" made. UK Anime Network commented on the series' second half that the series \"bites off more than it can chew, and at times the fervent mastication that comes from this leaves certain aspects of its narrative as something of a sloppy mess, but there's still an interesting story being told here and much of it is delivered in an enjoyable fashion thanks to a superb soundtrack, slick action set pieces, and some strong ideas that make good use of the show's cast of characters.\" Despite criticism, Andy Hanley of UK Anime Network praised the animation as \"visually eye-catching.\"\n\n"}

Excavated in Chencang District of Baoji, Shaanxi during the Daoguang era (1821–1851) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), it is on display in the National Museum of China in Beijing.\n\nThe Guoji Zibai \"pan\" is the largest known bronze plate in the world. It enjoys the reputation of the best bronzeware in the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 BC–771 BC). The Guoji Zibai \"pan\", the San Family Plate (), and the Mao Gong \"ding\", are known as the \"Three Important Bronzewares in the Western Zhou dynasty\".\n\nThe rectangular Guoji Zibai \"pan\" resembles a bathtub. It is high, long, and wide. It weighs . The four corners are regular fillets and the four feet are all in rectangular shape, and hidden at the bottom of the plate making the mouth of the plate appear large while the bottom small. On each wall outside of the plate, there are two beast heads with rings in the mouths, and decorative patterns in the shape of ware band.\n\nAccording to the inscription, the Guoji Zibai \"pan\" was cast by Guoji Zibai (), a nobleman in the Western Guo State (1046 BC–687 BC) in the Western Zhou dynasty (1046 BC–771 BC). The plate was cast in 816 BC, the 12th year of King Xuan of Zhou. Guoji was a major branch of the Guo lineage that ruled the Western Guo, and Zibai was his courtesy name.\n\nAccording to the inscription on the plate, in the 12 year of King Xuan of Zhou, also the year of 816 BC, Guoji Zibai was appointed by King Xuan to lead the army to battle with the nomadic tribe Xianyun in the north shore of Luo River, and gained a complete victory. Guoji Zibai cut the enemy's ears off and offered it to the King Xuan, King Xuan held a grand ceremony to honor his achievement and bestowed him a lot of horses and weapons to praise him. Guoji Zibai specially cast the bronze ware to memorize the military operation and honor.\n\nThe plate was cast in 816 BC, and the writing technique of the inscription on the plate was very similar to those of the \"Classic of Poetry\", which was the earliest collection of poetry in China.\n\nIn ancient China, water held in small plates was used for washing hands and faces, and in large plates it was used for baths. The rings on the outside walls of the plate were probably designed for carrying the plate to pour water conveniently. the Guoji Zibai \"pan\" was large, heavy and inconvenient to use in daily life. It seemed that it was more suitable to hold things in a large volume, just like \"Jian\" (), which was used to hold ice cube in ancient China. According to the set of etiquette at that time, when a high-ranking official died, his body should stay in the mortuary for seven days. In summer, ice was a must to prevent the body from decaying. Therefore, maybe the plate was a container used for holding ice cubes. But there has been no authoritative final conclusion about the exact usage of the plate in the academic circle.\n\nAccording to \"Prefecture Records of Luzhou\" (), the Guoji Zibai \"pan\" was unearthed at Guochuansi of Baoji, Shaanxi, in the Daoguang period (1821–1851) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911). Xu Xiejun (), the then magistrate of Mei County, purchased the plate for silver from a local peasant. And he brought the plate to his house \"Tianyou Hall\" (). In April 1860, it fell into the hands of Chen Kunshu and became the treasure of the Mansion of Prince Protector.\n\nIn May 1864, namely the 3rd year of Tongzhi period of Qing dynasty, Liu Mingchuan (1836–1896), general of the Huai Army, led the troops of Qing Empire to fight with the Taiping Army, and finally liberated Changzhou. When Liu moved into the mansion, his soldiers didn't know the plate and used it as a manger. One night when reading a book under the oil lamp, Liu heard clear metal clanks from out of the window. All was quiet at dead of night, so the clanks sounded clear and loud. Liu came to the stable following the sounds, and saw that a horse was eating grass with the bronze rings on the headstall hitting the manger from time to time to make the clanks. Liu was so curious that he bent to look carefully with the lantern, and found the manger wide and deep with fuzzy decorative patterns on its four sides. Liu tired to push the manger but failed. It was very unusual and he decided to check it out after the dawn. The next day he ordered his attendants to carry out the manger and wash it. The bronze ware was very exquisite and Liu was very fond of it. He immediately sent his trusted followers to transport the manger to his hometown, Hefei in Anhui. Liu specially invited Huang Congmo () who was familiar with ancient Chinese characters to help him research the bronze ware. Huang told him that most of bronze plates discovered in the past were round, and rectangular bronze ware was very rare, and such a large and rectangular plate was even more scarce and, or even might be the only one of its kind. And the inscription clearly showed that the bronze plate was casted by Guoji Zibai of the Western Guo State. After Liu understood the story of the manger he decided to protect it. Liu specially built an exquisite pavilion in his house, which he named \"Plate Pavilion\" () to preserve the plate. Huang made a piece of rubbing from its inscription and copied a lot of copies. Huang sold it on the market. Weng Tonghe (1830–1904), a collector and teacher of Guangxu Emperor, wanted to buy the plate but Liu refused. Weng told the Empress Dowager Cixi on Liu Mingchuan and complained about that. But Liu's superior Li Hongzhang explained that. Empress Dowager Cixi decreed to bestow the plate on Liu Mingchuan. In 1885 he was appointed the first provincial governor of Taiwan by the Qing government, a position he held for almost ten years until his retirement. From then on he lived a retiring life and didn't care about national affairs any more. The plate became his spiritual ballast in his declining years. In 1894, the Qing army were routed in the First Sino-Japanese War and the Qing government was forced to sign the \"Treaty of Shimonoseki\". When hearing the news, Liu was furious that he became illness suddenly and died with indignation. Before he died, he told his children again and again that the plate was a national treasure and they should protect it even risking their lives.\n\nIn 1911, the Xinhai Revolution was broke out, China was torn by warlords. Some warlords began to covet all kinds of national treasures that they knew heard of. The Guoji Zibai \"pan\" in the Liu Family was no exception. In May 1933, the then governor of Anhui Liu Zhenhua came to Liu's home in the name of visiting the descendant of Liu Mingchuan. When meeting Liu Suzeng (), the fourth generation-son of Liu Mingchuan. Liu Zhenhua first flattered him with a beaming face, then he changed the topic, saying that he want to see the plate. Liu Suzeng said calmly that his ancestors did actually collect a plate, but they had never seen it. Liu Zhenhua suddenly turned hostile and commanded his soldiers to search the house. They searched everywhere but found nothing there. Liu Zhenhua sent spies to watch every movement of the Liu Family in the hope of finding where the plate was. The Liu Family spent the next four year in fear and trembling.\n\nIn 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident was broke out, the Japanese army soon colonised the north China. After occupying Hefei, the Japanese army set a stronghold less than away from the Liu Family. Soon after, they sent a message to the Liu Family that they would like to change a golden plate of the same size for the Guoji Zibai \"pan\". Liu Suzeng answered immediately that they didn't have any treasure and if they had, they didn't want to be unworthy descendant, or the bad apples of the country to sell it to foreigners. Liu Suzeng thought it over and over and finally hit upon a good idea, they dug a big hole in their yard, and buried the plate in the hole and planted a little locust tree on it. In order to avoid the danger, the Liu Family moved to other places with same personal belongings at night to seek asylum. When the Japanese heard this, they made a wide and sweeping search of the Liu's house but found nothing. Finally, they set a fire on more than 30 buildings and than left.\n\nAfter the surrender of Japan, the Liu Family returned to home. Li Pinxian (1892–1987), a KMT general and the then governor of Anhui, ordered Liu Suzeng to hand over the plate, but Liu refused. A few days later, Li Pinxian deliberately said that Liu had stolen the box full of gold bars, and forced Liu to write the iou. The Liu Family had to flee their home to seek asylum again. Li Pinxian came to Liu's house with his troops, they looked around the house and dug the yard to a depth of three feet but found nothing.\n\nIn October 1949, after the establishment of the Communist State, the Ministry of Culture asked official from all over the country to rescue the treasures of cultural relics scattered from the folk. Wu Guichang (), chief of the CPC Feixi County Committee, heard the news that the Guoji Zibai \"pan\" is preserved in the Liu Family. Wu went to Liu's house many times and asked Liu Suzeng to donate the cultural relic to the country. Guo Chongyi (), a local member of the Chinese Democratic League, came to Liu's home with a document of the Central Government. After reading the document and talking with Guo Chongyi, Liu Suzeng decided to donate the treasure to the new country with a bronze drum of the Three Kingdoms period (220–280) together. On February 28, 1950, the Liu Family officially donated the plate to the Ministry of Culture. The government awarded Liu a certificate of praise and honor. Till then, the Guoji Zibai \"pan\" had accompanied the Liu Family for 86 years and been passed down by four generations. The Ministry of Culture gave the treasure to the National Museum of Chinese History. Later, the National Museum of Chinese History gave the relic to the National Museum of China. The Guoji Zibai \"pan\" has always been kept there since that time.\n\n\n"}

Ravven (born 1952) is the Bates and Benjamin Professor of Classical and Religious Studies at Hamilton College, where she has taught her specialization, Jewish Philosophy, and general Jewish Studies since 1983. She is a Fellow in Neurophilosophy of the Integrative Neurosciences Research Program, which is co-directed by Vilayanur Ramachandran and Kjell Fuxe. She has been appointed Visiting Professor of Philosophy in the School of Marxism at Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China, for 2017-20.\n\nProfessor Ravven holds a Ph.D. from Brandeis University (1984), attended Smith College, and is a 1970 graduate of the Commonwealth School, Boston. Ravven was a founding member of the Society for Empirical Ethics, an organization devoted to promoting dialogue among philosophers, neurobiologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and other social and natural scientists about ethics.\n\nRavven is a neurophilosopher and specialist on the philosophy of the seventeenth century philosopher, Baruch Spinoza. She was the first to argue that Spinoza's moral philosophy is a systems theory of ethics. Ravven was also the first philosopher to propose that Spinoza anticipated central discoveries in the neuroscience of the emotions. Ravven has published widely on Spinoza's philosophic thought, on the twelfth century philosopher Moses Maimonides, on G.W.F. Hegel and feminism, and on Jewish ethics and Jewish feminism.\n\nShe has been active in the Academy for Jewish Philosophy, the International Neuroethics Society, the North American Spinoza Society, and is a member of the American Philosophical Association, the Association for Jewish Studies, the International Academy of Law and Mental Health, and the Society for Jewish Ethics. Ravven is a past member of the Advisory Editorial Board of the \"Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics\". She is responsible for advising and editorial activities in two areas: in Neurophilosophy and also in Ethics.\n\nIn 2004 Ravven received an unsolicited $500,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to write a book rethinking ethics. That book, \"The Self Beyond Itself: An Alternative History of Ethics, the New Brain Sciences, and the Myth of Free Will\" was published by The New Press in May, 2013. It is an extended and multidisciplinary inquiry into moral agency: why we are moral, why and when we are not, and how to get people to be more moral. Ravven concludes with her own theory of moral agency inspired by the philosophy of Spinoza, which she updates to reflect contemporary understandings of how the brain/mind works in moral thinking and action. The book is accessibly written for a generally educated audience rather than just for specialists.\n\nIn \"The Self Beyond Itself: An Alternative History of Ethics, the New Brain Sciences, and the Myth of Free Will,\" Ravven challenges the idea of free will. Attributing free will to human beings means that human beings have the capacity to rise above both nature and nurture and even current situation to be good people and choose to act ethically. This capacity to choose our actions—to rise above our genetic inheritance whatever it might be, above our upbringing no matter how terrible it was, and above our present situation despite its social pressures—is what is meant by \"free will.\" We do moral acts for moral reasons, for no other fully determining reasons, and out of no other fully determining causes—such as brain modules, group pressures, or upbringing. And that is why we can be held morally responsible. Ravven argues that this view is false and also that it is a cultural belief particular to the Western world. She traces the belief in free will to a theological myth and notion of human nature, and exposes the origins of the idea of free will in the Christian theology of the Latin West originating in the Church Father St. Augustine. She describes how that theology became secularized so that many today are unaware than free will presupposes a human person beyond nature and environment who can intervene as if from above (like an all-powerful God). \"The Self Beyond Itself\" was translated into Chinese under the direction of Professor Han Quihong of Northeast Normal University in Changchun, China, and published by the People's Publishing House in 2016.\n\nRavven turns to search the new brain sciences to discover new ways that moral agency could be rethought without free will. She concludes that there are three factors that together determine action: nature (biology, etc.), nurture (biography, history, culture, language, etc.), and present situation (social belonging and its demands, incentives, and disincentives, and the like). So the most effective way of changing individual behavior is to intervene in social and cultural and familial systems at every scale. Promoting and bolstering diversity and whistle blowing within all these systems is vital to combating the tendencies to Groupthink that human nature makes us all too prone to. For we are social and contextual beings—our brains have evolved that way. Nevertheless, as Spinoza anticipated, an arduous path of the education of desire can lead to independence of mind from the tyranny of the immediate local world for those who undertake it. We can learn to be good even if we cannot freely choose to be good.\n\nHeidi Ravven has written extensively on the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza. Her articles appear in a number of journals and several have been republished in anthologies. Ravven believes that Spinoza's philosophy is the best starting point for trying to integrate the evidence emerging from the new brain sciences into a viable model of the basic moral brain, the optimal route to its development, and the implications of such a view for how social, legal, political, and other institutions and practices might to be redesigned. Ravven is now engaged in writing a book accessible to a generally educated audience on the relevance of Spinoza, called \"The Return of Spinoza.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "51477023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51477023", "title": "History of electroconvulsive therapy in the United States", "text": "History of electroconvulsive therapy in the United States\n\nElectroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a somewhat controversial therapy used to treat certain mental illnesses such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, depressed bipolar disorder, manic excitement, and catatonia. These disorders are difficult to live with and often very difficult to treat, leaving individuals suffering for long periods of time. In general, ECT is not looked at as a first line approach to treating a mental disorder, but rather a last resort treatment when medications such as antidepressants are not helpful in reducing the clinical manifestations. \n\n“Electroconvulsive therapy entails deliberately inducing a modified generalized seizure under medically-controlled conditions to obtain a therapeutic effect” The therapeutic effect being reduced clinical manifestations of one’s mental disorder, therefore leading to less suffering. “ECT has been shown through various research trials to cause significant physiological and chemical changes at a molecular level of the brain; however, it is thought that the sustainability of ECT is threatened due to associated stigma and poor impression of the treatment itself”. In order to decrease the associated stigma and keep the treatment available to those who need it, the evidence on the efficacy needs to be publicized. \n\nBefore the 20century, observations of the relationship between mental health and the physical body began to take place in the world of psychiatry. Between 1917 and 1934, there were developments in treating mental illnesses by physical means. Eventually by 1938, ECT was first used by neurologist Ugo Cerletti to treat schizophrenia. ECT’s popularity grew after it was observed that it was safer and more effective than previous somatic treatments, and it was noted that people with depression benefited more from ECT than those with schizophrenia.  \n\nUntil the end of the 1960s, the way in which ECT was performed could be considered, for lack of a better term, shocking. “In these early days clients might be ‘shocked’ in open, communal wards of psychiatric asylums, tied to beds, without anaesthetic or muscle-relaxing agents, often several times a week. As an unfortunate consequence, many of the patients who underwent ECT felt abused, oppressed, punished and damaged, all of which had a negative impact on the treatment itself and psychiatry as a whole”. \n\n“Aside from the therapy’s crude beginnings, controversy may have also been caused by a lack of information given when practitioners obtain informed consent before treatment, unknown mechanism of action, lack of knowledge about the cognitive adverse effects that can occur, divergent views of clinicians and consumers about ECT, and wide variations in official guidelines on minimal standards of ECT use”.  \n\nEssentially, the usage of ECT to treat mental disorder has been highly scrutinized by practitioners, and the general public as whole due to its controversial history in psychiatry, combined with its negative stigma in the modern world. This negative stigma in the modern world has created little importance in providing the adequate education for medical personal at all levels, including medical student and board-certified psychiatrists. “It should be standard practice for all medical students to learn the basics of ECT and for all psychiatric residents to know enough about it to refer patients for whom ECT is an appropriate treatment consideration”. The effectiveness of ECT is high compared to antidepressants and other antidepressant treatments such as vagus nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation; for this reason, clients, students, and medical professionals should be informed about the benefits and effectiveness that ECT can offer. \n\n“Some of the professional and popular ambivalence toward ECT is related to the fact that we still do not know exactly how it works”. The lack of awareness on the effectiveness of ECT and the poor understanding of the exact functionality behind the treatment leads others to believe that ECT is unscientific. “The precise mechanism underlying the efficacy of ECT remains unclear, but one theory is that it promotes neuroplasticity by optimizing or “resetting” existing brain networks”. ECT is thought to be morally wrong, just like other medical procedures that bring up controversy, such as abortion. However, “The best spokespeople for ECT are those patients and their family members who know from personal experience how debilitating depression can be and how effectively ECT can provide relief”.\n\n“Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for various psychiatric disorders since its introduction, it is one of the most controversial and scrutinized therapies in psychiatry”. Because it is highly controversial and scrutinized there is lack of importance given to educating students about ECT. “The negative connotations related to ECT tend to get reinforced from lack of knowledge and negative attitudes”. With the lack of knowledge students cannot provide client’s all alternatives to their entitled care. Educating students is important because they can go through their career understanding the many alternatives and they can provide patients with a knowledgeable background to support it. “Nurses play an essential role in ECT, because of their close involvement with patients before and after the procedure. The knowledge and attitude of the nursing staff working ECT rooms can have direct impact on the quality of their nursing practice”. In a study, published in the \"Journal of Neuroscience in Rural Practice\", there was a total of 183 nursing students that were surveyed on their knowledge about electroconvulsive therapy. “Only about half (53.6%) of the participants were aware that ECT cannot be given against the wishes of the patients”. This result has a lot to do with the associated stigma, that patients receive ECT against their will, no treatment is given against the patients wishes. Changing this stigma can happen with knowledge that starts at school. “The present study shows that there are gaps in knowledge about ECT among nursing students… To fill such gaps there is a need to develop more pro-ECT curriculum”.\n\nElectroconvulsive therapy is effectively used in major depressive patients to “increase the amount of nerve cells in the hippocampus, a region of the brain that is involved in mood regulation and memory. Antidepressants drugs have a similar effect but to a lesser extent than ECT” \n\nECT is prescribed by a psychiatrist. Indications for ECT use were initially for schizophrenia, and those who poorly respond to medications. ECT can be used in the treatment for those with major depressive disorder, depressed bipolar disorder, manic bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, manic excitement, and catatonia. “Decision to conduct ECT therapy usually comes after there has been failure in other forms of treatment, including medication and psychotherapy”. \n\nPrior to performing ECT, a set of tests are performed to ensure the patient fits the needs for ECT without further complication in their health status, that may prevent them from being eligible for treatment. Other medical screenings are performed to ensure that their depression is not caused by other medial illness, because that can have ECT be ineffective. “Before starting electroconvulsive therapy, all patients are screened for medical illnesses, for two reasons. First, a variety of medical illnesses are associated with depression or mania. The second reason for screening the patient is to establish that it is safe to proceed with ECT”. Once the patient passed those two screening, the patient then is evaluated on their medical history, physical exam, psychiatric history, mental status exam, blood count, chemistries, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram. Contraindications and risk include: cerebral aneurysms, heart attack, emphysema, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy.\n\nBefore performing ECT, clients are instructed to take nothing by mouth for 8 hours before the procedure to prevent aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs that could increase the risk of pneumonia. The client also has a secured peripheral intravenous (IV) access, blood pressure cuff around one extremity, and is connected to an electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG) and pulse oximetry. The ECG and EEG are used to monitor electrical currents of the induced seizure. The nurse then ensures, “the patient is fully informed about their illness, why ECT has been recommended for them, the treatment process initially and throughout the course, allaying fears of the patient or their family may have about ECT and directing their attention to scientific fact and evidence supporting its use” \n\nThe client is then given a short-acting anesthetic, such as methohexital, and also given a muscle relaxant, such as succinylcholine.  Once the determination of muscle paralysis is determined, a mild electrical current is administered to the patient’s brain. Paralysis is determined by observing the extremity that the blood pressure cuff is placed on. The blood pressure is inflated to stop the effects of the muscle relaxant to a specific part of the body, allowing muscle to contract from the electrical current that is administered to the patient’s brain. It is important to see the physical signs along with activity on EEG to determine the effectiveness of the procedure. “Small amounts of physical movement may be seen in the face, feet, or hands. These movements are not nearly as severe as those that occurred before the advent of muscle relaxants”. \n\nAfter receiving ECT, “nurses will ensure the patient’s airway is maintained, monitor observations and administer prescribed medications to counter adverse effects…”. After ensuring the patient is stable, the nurse would observe for normal side effects and document those side effects. “There is a period of confusion and disorientation that rapidly follows the treatment; it clears quickly. With each successive treatment, the patient is left with an ongoing loss of memory which will gradually clear after the course of therapy is finished”. “Patients usually receive 6 to 12 treatments for full therapeutic benefit, but the number of ECT applications is titrated individually for each case”. In many cases, the client receives ECT multiple times per week and a gradual decrease in treatments once the therapeutic effect is reached and noticed by client and physician.\n\n“There are no absolute reasons not to perform electroconvulsive therapy. There are certain conditions, however, that produce a significant increase risk with ECT”. The list of contraindications for receiving ECT is relatively short. Once the decision to undergo ECT is made collaboratively between the patient and physician, the patient is screened for any contraindications. These include a history of cerebral aneurysms, heart attack, emphysema, multiple sclerosis, and muscular dystrophy. \n\nThe client can exhibit side effects such as nausea, headache, muscle stiffness, transient confusion, and temporary memory loss. “The most disturbing and severe side effect of ECT is memory loss. It is believed that this side effect is attributable to the electricity that is passed through the brain”. “Most people return to reasonable function within the first month and to complete function after six months.” (Piotrowski and Guerra, 2013). These side effects are rare but commonly subside shortly after treatment. “For many people, the potential for adverse events outweigh the potential benefit of the treatment, even if the end result may be remission from depression”. \n\nAntidepressants are considered a first line treatment for depression. While these medications are assessable to most, and effective enough to reduce clinical manifestations and increase quality of life for many suffering from depression, they are often not effective for severe depression and they come with a large array of side effects. There are multiple types of antidepressant medications: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), noradrenaline uptake inhibitors (NRIs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as well as tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, all of which have a different list of unpleasant side effects. \n\nSide effects of MAOIs include tremors, insomnia, increased appetite leading to weight gain, blurred vision, urinary retention, headaches, acute hypertension and can even lead to intracranial hemorrhage when taken with food substances containing tyramine. As one could imagine, these side effects are not easy to live with, especially on top of the already crippling aspects of living with mental illnesses such as depression. “Side effects of SSRIs and NRIs include nausea, anorexia, insomnia, loss of libido, and when combined with MOAIs, tremors, cardiovascular collapse and hyperthermia.\n\nAside from the aforementioned side effects, perhaps the greatest side effect of pharmacological therapy is the efficacy in general-do they actually work? In some cases, “depression is considered “treatment-resistant,” meaning there is no clinical improvement in depressive symptoms after two trials of at least two antidepressants from two different classes and psychotherapy for 6-8 weeks; depression with psychotic features is considered “refractory” when it does not improve after one or two trials of antidepressant/antipsychotic combination”.When medication is simply not effective, ECT has been shown, through various research trials, to cause significant physiological and chemical changes at molecular level of the brain which accounts for its therapeutic effect. \n\nAs previously stated, ECT is not considered a first-line treatment for depression, but rather an intervention used when other interventions such as antidepressant medications do not help relieve one’s symptoms. According to \"Pakistan Armed Forces Medical Journal\", a descriptive case study conducted from April 2017 to October 2017 gathered a sample of 47 patients age 18-65 of either gender with treatment resistant depression with or without psychotic features. Each patient was prescribed ECT for treatment resistant depression when there was no clinical improvement with two trials of anti- depressants from different pharmacological groups along with psychotherapy for at least 6-8 weeks or no clinical response to one or two courses of an antidepressant/antipsychotic combination in case of psychotic symptoms. Participants in this study underwent 6 sessions (3 weeks) of ECT and were then assessed for clinical symptom improvement.  “The study concluded that efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy in patients with treatment-resistant depression was overall high with no major difference found in efficacy with respect to variables like age, gender, and psychosis”. \n\nWith the addition of multiple antidepressants and antipsychotics to treat mental disorders, ECT is not widely implemented in the U.S. today, despite the research that suggests it is an effective treatment for severe depression and other mental illnesses. The negative stigma surrounding ECT, thanks to its crude beginnings in psychology along with its perhaps not so accurate portrayal in movies and television, is still alive and well. However, because the methods used to perform ECT have drastically changed since it’s earlier days, individuals may be more open to trying ECT to relieve their symptoms of severe mental illnesses that have not responded to first line treatment. The fears surrounding the procedure are somewhat justified considering the history, but research and new implementation of ECT by trained physicians has proven that this is a safe and effective treatment that has the potential to help many individuals. Further education in medical and nursing schools will help to further promote the implementation of ECT and help those suffering in the vicious cycle of trying to relieve the symptoms of their mental illness. \n"}
{"id": "34517249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34517249", "title": "Information policy", "text": "Information policy\n\nInformation policy is the set of all public laws, regulations and policies that encourage, discourage, or regulate the creation, use, storage, access, and communication and dissemination of information. It thus encompasses any other decision-making practice with society-wide constitutive efforts that involve the flow of information and how it is processed.\n\nThere are several fundamental issues that comprise information policy. Most prominent are public policy issues concerned with the use of information for democratization and commercialization of social life. These issues include, inter alia, digital environment, such as intellectual property, economic regulations, freedom of expression, confidentiality or privacy of information, information security, access management, and regulating how the dissemination of public information occurs.\n\nInformation policy became a prominent field of study during the latter half of the 20th century as the shift from an industrial to an information society transpired. It has since then evolved from being seen as relatively unimportant to having a much more overarching strategic significance since it establishes the conditions “under which all other decision making, public discourse, and political activity occur.” The growing awareness in the importance of information policy has sparked an interest in various groups to further study and analyze its magnitude. The most common audience for information policy analysis includes undergraduate and graduate students, scholars, policymakers, policy analysts, as well as those members of the public who have taken an interest in understanding the effects of the laws and regulations involving information.\n\nAlthough information policy generally has a broader definition and encapsulates a multitude of components, its scope and impact can vary depending on the context. For example, in the context of an information lifecycle, information policy refers to the laws and policies that deal with the stages information goes through beginning with its creation, through its collection, organization, dissemination, and finally to its destruction. On the other hand, in the context of public administration, information policy is the means by which government employees, institutions, and information systems adapt themselves to an environment in rapid fluctuation and use information for decision-making (e.g., Andersen and Dawes, 1991; also see Bozeman and Bretschneider, 1986, and Stevens and McGowan, 1985). One can see how these two contexts offer varying scopes for the phrase “ information policy.”\n\nInformation policy is in fact, a combination of several varying disciplines including information science, economics, law, and public policy. Thus, its scope may differ when each of these disciplines analyses or uses it. The information sciences may be more concerned with technical advances and how this impacts information policy, while from a law perspective, issues such as privacy rights and intellectual property may be of greatest focus.\n\nThe earliest sight of information policy was present around the mid-1900s. The stages to begin evolving from an industrial society to an information society sparked several other transformations. The common industrial technologies were beginning to be replaced by informational meta-technologies. Organizations began changing their form, several new architectures of knowledge developed, and most importantly, the information economy replaced industrial and agricultural economies.\n\nBy the 1970s, the concept of national information policy was created to protect the data and information that was used in creating public policies. The earliest adopters of information policy included the United States, Australia, as well as several European countries who all recognized the importance for a more standardized governance of information.\n\nElizabeth Orna contributed to a paper on information policies by providing a brief history of the development of ideas surrounding national and organizational information policies, from the beginning when the United Kingdom Ministry of Information was established in the First World War to present day. The history of information policy is reflected in this chart.\n\nIn the 20th century, to cope with the privacy problems of databases, information policy evolved further safeguards. In the USA, the federal Privacy Act provides individuals the right to inspect and correct personal information in federal datafiles.\n\nThe types of information policy can be separated into two different categories. It can be discussed in the short-term focus exclusively on information science. It can also have a much broader context in relation to different subjects and be within a larger time period, for example dating back to Roman civilization, the Bill of Rights, or the Constitution.\n\nThe obvious reason for the need of information policy deals with the legal issues that can be associated with the advancement of technology. More precisely, — the digitization of the cultural content made the cost of the copy decreasing to nearly zero and increased the illegal exchange of files, online, via sharing web site or P2P technologies, or off line (copy of hard disks). As a result, there are many grey areas between what users can and cannot do, and this creates the need for some sort of regulation. Today, this has led to the creation of SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act). Information policy will mark the boundaries needed to evaluate certain issues dealing with the creation, processing, exchange, access, and use of information.\n\n1. for avoiding risks (financial losses from incomplete and uncoordinated exploitation of information, wasted time, failures of innovation, and reputation loss);\n\n2. for positive benefits, including negotiation and openness among those responsible for different aspects of information management\n3. productive use of IT in supporting staff in their use of information\n\n4. ability to initiate change to take advantage of changing environments\n\nThere are some issues around organizational information policies, which are the interaction between human beings and technology for using information, the issue to proceed information policy itself, whether top-down or middle-up-down, is the best way to approach information policy in an organization. Also, issues that information tends to be influenced by organization’s culture that result in complexity of information flow. Moreover, the concern about valuing information is discussed by Orna, the fact that value of information is dependant on the user, and it can’t be measured by price. Considering that information is an asset or intellectual capital that becomes valuable when it is used in productive ways.\n\nConvergence essentially combines all forms of media, telecommunications, broadcasting, and computing by the use of a single technology: digital computers. It integrates diverse technological systems in the hopes of improving performance of similar tasks. Convergence is thought to be the result of the need for expansion into new markets due to competition and technological advances that have created a threat of new entrants into various segments of the value chain. As a result, previously disparate technologies interact with one other synergistically to deliver information in new and unique ways and allow for inventive solutions to be developed.\n\nNearly every innovative trend in the social industry involves adding data or layers of connectivity. Social networking sites have begun interacting with e-mail functionalities, search engines have begun integrating Internet searches with Facebook data, Twitter along with various other social media platforms have started to play a prominent role in the emergency management framework (mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery) among several others.\n\nIn 2012 a prominent issue arose that deals with the convergence of social media with copyright infringement monitoring systems. The growing interest in this topic can be largely attributed to the recent anti-piracy bills: the Stop Online Piracy Act and the PROTECT IP Act. Various officials from all over the world have expressed an interest in forcing social networks to install and utilize monitoring systems to determine if users are illegally obtaining copyrighted material. For example, if implemented, these filters could prevent the illegal sharing of music over social networking platforms. The convergence of search engines and social networks could make this process even easier. Search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and Bing have begun to merge with social media platforms to link Internet searches to your social networking sites such as Facebook. This poses an even greater threat to users since their Internet searches can be monitored via their social networks.\n\nThe issue of converging social networks with piracy monitoring systems becomes controversial when it comes to protecting personal data and abiding by privacy laws. In order for a synergy such as this one to take place, regulatory convergence would need to be considered. Regulatory convergence is the merging of previously disparate industry-based laws and regulations into a single legal and regulatory framework.\n\nInternet governance has both narrow and broad definitions, thus, making it a complex concept to understand. When most people think of Internet governance, they think of the regulations of the content and conduct that are communicated and acted on through the Internet. Although this is certainly a broad component of Internet governance, additionally, there are more narrow elements to the definition that are often overlooked. Internet governance also encompasses the regulation of Internet infrastructure and the processes, systems, and institutions that regulate the fundamental systems that determine the capabilities of the Internet.\n\nArchitecture is the foundation of the Internet. The fundamental goal of the Internet architecture is to essentially create a network of networks by interconnecting various computer network systems globally. Protocols such as TCP/IP as well as other network protocols serve as the rules and conventions by which computers can communicate with each other. Thus, TCP/IP is often viewed as the most important institution of Internet governance. It serves as the backbone to network connectivity.\nOrganizations such as the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) coordinate the various systems within the Internet on a global level to help preserve the operational stability of the Internet. For example, coordination of IP addresses and managing the Domain Name System (DNS) ensure computers and devices can correctly connect to the Internet and can communicate effectively globally. If regulation of these crucial elements of the Internet such as TCP/IP and DNS were governed by disparate principles, the Internet would no longer exist as it does today. Networks, computers, and peripherals would not be able to communicate and have the same accessibility if these foundational elements varied.\n\nLike with any policy, there needs to be an agent to govern and regulate it. With information policy in a broader sense, the government has several roles and responsibilities. Some examples include providing accurate information, producing and maintaining information that meets the specific needs of the public, protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal and sensitive information, and making informed decisions on which information should be disseminated and how to distribute it effectively, among others. Although the government plays an active role in information policy, the analysis of information policy should not only include the formal decision making processes by government entities, but also the formal and informal decisions of both the private and public sector of governance.\n\nA persistent debate concerning the government role in information policy is the separation of security and freedom of information. Legislation such as the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USAPATRIOT or USAPA) Act of 2001 is an example of security taking precedence over civil liberties. The USAPA affected several surveillance and privacy laws to include: \nThe USAPA was passed in October 2001, not long after 9/11 and without much contention from congress. Civil liberties advocates argue that the changes made to the standing surveillance laws were done in an abrupt manner and without consideration to basic rights as outlined in the US constitution, specifically fourth amendment rights which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.\n\nThe five broad methodological strands that Rowlands (1996) identified are current tools for information policy study:\n\nClassification: The tool demonstrates a wide range of issues and subjects on information policy. It helps research to understand the breadth of the subject. The published materials are reasonably well documented and described. It is also good for start-up literature review and research purposes.\n\nIdentification of policy issues and options: This tool relies on inputs for information; for example, interviews and questionnaires targeting policy makers and other stakeholders. It is a commonly used in the studies of on-the-job policy makers in government or industry (Moore and Steele, 1991; McIntosh, 1990; Rowlands, 1997).\n\nReductionism: The reductionist approach control factors to reduce ambiguity. The factors include constraining data collection, analysis and interpretation within the framework of a specific discipline. It helps researchers to notice how a specific factor relates to the overall environment. \nForecasting and scenario-building: The commonly used model is STEEP framework. It helps in reducing uncertainties for a topic that is under studies.\n\nProcess-oriented research and cases studies: It provides detailed contextual analyses of particular events. It helps researcher to experience the policy process in semi-real situation and study its outcome.\n\nIn regards to the future of information policy, it should be flexible and changing to different circumstances as the ability to access, store, and share information grows. Galvin suggests that information policy might include setting a boundary to the uncertainty in this field. As information policy becomes a larger and more important topic, it will also become a greater subject to governmental regulation in regards to the future of technology as well. It will also include the studies of these subjects: information science, communications, library science, and technology studies.\n\nThe information policies will earn more advantages for national and organizational, such as getting the best from development of Web 2.0 nationally and in organization, influence people for paying attention to the socio aspect and socio-technical system, for securing preservation of digital content, bringing out information product, also respecting all users and making thinking time respectable.\n\nIn order to achieve this national organization, it will be important to focus not only on a domestic level but also nationally. Making domestic agencies cooperate internationally (and vice versa) though, will not be overly successful. A single nation can take the lead in establishing communication-based relationships specifically regarding the internet. These relations will need to be slowly and consistently established in order to truly unify any kind of information policy and decision-making. If information policy can be established and guided on a semi-national level, the degree of communication and cooperation throughout the world will increase dramatically. As information policy continues to shape many aspects of society, these international relations will become vital (Harpham, 2011).\n\nInformation policy is playing a greater role in the economy leading to the production of goods and services, as well as selling them directly to consumers (UCLA, 2009). The cost of information varies from a tangible good in that initial costs of the first unit are large and fixed; however, after that, marginal costs are relatively low (MacInnes, 2011). As an increase from the information services, information can be paralleled to that of manufacturing several years ago (UCLA, 2009). The digitalization of information allows businesses to make better justified business decisions (MacInnes, 2011).\n\n\n"}

Previously, the Commission on Higher Education supervises the legal education in the Philippines but was replaced by the Legal Education Board since 1993 after the enactment of Republic Act No. 7662 or the Legal Education Reform Act of 1993.\n\nThe legal education in the Philippines was first introduced during the Spanish occupation when, in 1734, the University of Santo Tomas established the Faculty of Civil Law. After the Malolos Constitution was ratified, the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas was established by Joaquin Gonzales in 1899; the said institution offered several courses including law. However, the Literaria's existence was short lived as a result of the eruption of the Filipino-American conflict. During the American occupation, specifically in 1911, the University of the Philippines College of Law was established, through the vision and efforts of George Malcolm. The said law institution continues to be the one of the oldest state college of law in the country.\n\nThe ratification of the 1935 Constitution paved the way for the establishment of law programs in various private colleges and universities in Manila (schools, at that time, were required to acquire license to operate from the Department of Public Instruction). At that time, there was hardly any kind of supervision of law schools, especially for private institutions. The Faculty of Civil Law of the University of Santo Tomas, the University of the Philippines–College of Law, the former Colegio de Ateneo de Manila and the Philippine Law School were the leading law institutions during those period. After World War II and in the contemporary time, more law schools were then established.\n\nThe Legal Education Board supervises all law schools and continuing legal education providers in the Philippines. The Board is headed by a Chairman who is a retired justice of a collegiate court (i.e., Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals, etc.). Regular members of the Board include a representative from each of the following:\n\n\nThe Board has made legal reforms which include—the stricter selection of law students and law professors; improvements in quality of instruction and facilities of law schools; provisions for legal apprenticeship of law students; and the requirement of attendance to continuing legal education seminars for practicing attorneys.\n\nLawyers with names appearing in the \"Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court\", unless disbarred, are all members of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP). However, to be IBP members of good standing, lawyers are required to complete, every three years, at least thirty-six hours of continuing legal education seminars approved by the Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Committee (MCLE). Members who fail to comply shall pay a non-compliance fee, and shall be listed as a delinquent member.\n\nThe Mandatory Continuing Legal Education Office, established by the Supreme Court, is the official government agency tasked to implement compliance with the MCLE requirement. The MCLE Office is headed by former Supreme Court Justice Carolina C. Grino-Aquino, widow of former Supreme Court Chief Justice Ramon Aquino. Its office is located at the fourth floor of the IBP Building in Ortigas Center.\n\nThe Philippine legal system is an amalgamation of the world's major systems. These systems include the Roman civil law which was inherited from Spain; the Anglo-American common law which were derived from the laws of the United States; and Islamic law otherwise known as the Shariah law of the Muslim world, Private law and legal codes are substantially patterned after the civil law of Spain, while the Public Law, including the Political law, is based on Anglo-American legal system.\n\nLaw degree programs are considered professional/post-baccalaureate programs in the Philippines. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas. Completion of a required course from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement in order to take the Philippine Bar Examination, the national licensure examination as precursor to admission to the practice of law in the country.\n\nLegal education in the Philippines normally proceeds along the following route:\n\nLaw degrees in the Philippines may be classified into three types—professional, graduate level, and honorary.\n\nIn order to be eligible to take the bar examinations, one must complete one of the two professional degrees: The Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) program or the Juris Doctor (J.D.) program. Advanced degrees are offered by some law schools, but are not requirements for admission to the practice of law in the Philippines.\n\n\nBeyond the J.D. or LL.B., members of the Philippine bar have the option of pursuing graduate degrees in law.\n\n\nSome Philippine universities also confer the honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree. It is given to famous individuals who, in the discretion of the awarding institution, were found to have made significant contributions to a certain field, or to the improvement of society or development of the conditions of mankind in general.\n\nA few Roman Catholic seminaries and graduate schools offer degree programs in canon law, an ecclesiastical program that is not required in the Philippine Bar Examinations.The University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Canon Law runs the oldest academic programs of this kind. Its Licentiate of Canon Law (J.C.L.) and Doctor of Canon Law (J.C.D.) programs are open to priests, nuns, theologians, and even to lay people (i.e., trial court judges, law deans, family lawyers etc.). Judges of the Roman Catholic Marriage Tribunal typically hold academic degrees in the field. Degrees in canon law, strictly speaking, are not considered law degrees in the Philippines.\n\nThere is a move among members of the Philippine Association of Law Schools (PALS) to convert their LL.B. programs into J.D. curricula. There are currently two possible directions for the change: First, the conversion of LL.B. programs through adopting a model substantially similar to the J.D. curriculum introduced by the Ateneo de Manila Law School (the J.D. Programs of the FEU-La Salle consortium and the University of Batangas Law School are of this mold), and second, simply changing the name of the degree conferred from \"LL.B.\" to \"J.D.\" while essentially retaining the same course offerings as those in the DECS Model Law Curriculum (DECS Order No. 27, series of 1989).\n\nThe 1987 Constitution of the Philippines has given the Supreme Court the sole power to admit individuals to the practice of law in the Philippines. This power is exercised through a Bar Examination Committee, an ad hoc academic group tasked to formulate questions, administer proceedings, grade examinations, rank candidates, and release the results of the Philippine Bar Examination.\n\nTo be eligible to take the national bar exam, a candidate must be a Filipino citizen, at least twenty-one years of age, and holder of a bachelor's degree and a law degree obtained from a government recognized law school in the Philippines. Graduates of law schools from other countries must obtain a law degree from the Philippines to qualify for the Philippine Bar. In March 2010 the Supreme court issued Bar matter 1153 allowing Filipino who are foreign law graduates to take the Bar exam provided that applicant complies with the following conditions: \n\nThe Philippine Bar Examinations is the national licensure exam for admission to the practice of law. It is conducted during the four Sundays of September, or October, or November of every year. It is arguably the hardest and the most media-covered of all government licensure examinations in the country. It is also reputedly one of the hardest bar examinations in the world.\n\nFor candidates intending to practice Islamic law in the Philippines, the \"Special Bar Exams for Shari'a Court Lawyers\" is given every two years. The Supreme Court Bar Office conducts the exam while the Office of Muslim Affairs determines the qualification and eligibility of candidates to the exams.\n\nTo be a full-fledged lawyer in the Philippines and be eligible to use the title \"Attorney\", a candidate must graduate from a Philippine law school, take and pass the Philippine Bar Examinations, the candidate who passed the bar examinations is entitled to take and subscribe before the Supreme Court special en banc session the corresponding Attorney's Oath, as follows:\n\nThe certificate to practice law will be granted by the Supreme Court after the lawyer sign his name in the \"Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court\". The full names of lawyers are found in the \"Rolls of Attorneys of the Supreme Court\", and in a similar list included in a Supreme Court publication entitled \"Law List.\"\n\nStarting from 2017, the Legal Education Board had started implementing the Philippine Law School Admission Test ; the failure to pass such admission test prohibits a person from enrolling to any law schools in the Philippines. It is a one-day aptitude test intended to measure the academic potential of an examinee who wishes to pursue the study of law.\n\n, there are 108 law schools legitimately operating throughout the Philippines. These include independent law schools, resident colleges, and affiliated units of much larger private and public universities:\n</small>\n\nThe following schools are the top performing law schools in the Philippines. Such ranking was based upon the cumulative performance from the recent results of the bar examinations from 2012 to 2014. In the list, 4 out 10 law schools are outside Metro Manila:\n"}

It is characterized by a variety of features, particularly among older speakers, including \"r\"-dropping (non-rhoticity), resistance to the horse–hoarse merger, a deletion or \"breaking\" of certain syllables, and some unique vocabulary. This traditional Maine accent is rapidly declining; a 2013 study of Portland speakers found the horse–hoarse merger to be currently embraced by all ages and the cot–caught merger to be resisted, despite being typical among other Eastern New England speakers, even reported in the 1990s in Portland itself. In the northern region of Maine along the Quebec border, Franco-Americans may show French-language influences in their English.\n\nMaine English often features phonetic change or phonological change of certain characteristics. One such characteristic is that, like in all traditional Eastern New England English, Maine English pronounces the \"r\" sound only when it comes before a vowel, but not before a consonant or in any final position. For example, \"car\" may sound to listeners like \"cah\" and \"Mainer\" like \"Mainah.\" \n\nAlso, as in much New England English, the final \"-ing\" ending in multi-syllable words sounds more like \"-in,\" for example, in \"stopping\" and \"starting\" .\n\nThe Maine accent follows the pronunciation of Eastern New England English, with the following additional features:\n\nThe traditional Maine dialect has a fairly rich vocabulary.

It is on the coastline south of the city of Chennai. An ancient historic town and a bustling seaport in the 1st millennium CE, now a beachside tourism center with a group of Tamil monuments declared as UNESCO world heritage site, it is one of the most visited towns in South India.\n\nMamallapuram was one of two major port cities by the 7th century within the Pallava kingdom. Along with economic prosperity, it became a center of a group of battle monuments carved out of rock. These are dated to the 7th and 8th centuries: rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), giant open-air rock reliefs such as the famous \"Descent of the Ganges\", and the Shore Temple dedicated to Shiva, Durga, Vishnu, Krishna and others. The contemporary town plan was established by the British Raj in 1827.\n\nNeolithic \nburial urn, cairn circles and jars with burials dating to the very dawn of the Christian era have been discovered near Mamallapuram. The Sangam age poem Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai relates the rule of King Thondaiman Ilam Thiraiyar at Kanchipuram of the Tondai Nadu port \"Nirppeyyaru\" which scholars identify with the present-day Mamallapuram. Chinese coins and Roman coins of Theodosius I in the 4th century CE have been found at Mamallapuram revealing the port as an active hub of global trade in the late classical period. Two Pallava coins bearing legends read as Srihari and Srinidhi have been found at Mamallapuram. The Pallava kings ruled Mamallapuram from Kanchipuram; the capital of the Pallava dynasty from the 3rd century to 9th century CE, and used the port to launch trade and diplomatic missions to Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.\nAn 8th-century Tamil text written by Thirumangai Alvar described this place as Sea Mountain ‘where the ships rode at anchor bent to the point of breaking laden as they were with wealth, big trunked elephants and gems of nine varieties in heaps’. It is also known by several other names such as MAMALLAPATINAM and Mamallapuram. Another name by which Mamallapuram has been known to mariners, at least since Marco Polo’s time is \"Seven Pagodas\" alluding to the Seven Pagodas of Mamallapuram that stood on the shore, of which one, the Shore Temple, survives.\n\nThe temples of Mapuram, portraying events described in the Mahabharata, were built largely during the reigns of Narasimhavarman and his successor Rajasimhavarman and show the movement from rock-cut architecture to structural building. The city of Mamallapuram was founded by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century AD. The mandapa or pavilions and the rathas or shrines shaped as temple chariots are hewn from the granite rock face, while the famed Shore Temple, erected half a century later, is built from dressed stone. What makes Mamallapuram so culturally resonant are the influences it absorbs and disseminates. The Shore Temple includes many reliefs, including one 100 ft. long and 45 ft. high, carved out of granite.\n\nMTC and TNSTC (Villupuram) Kanchipuram division buses are operating bus from Chennai, Chengalpattu, Kancheepuram, Thiruttani etc. Apart from TNSTC MTC operating buses to Mahabalipuram from various parts of the city with Deluxe and Air conditioned Deluxe buses\n\nMTC bus Routes towards Mahabalipuram\n\nMahabalipuram has a tropical wet and dry climate. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is Aw. The average annual temperature is 28.4 °C. The temperatures are highest on average in May, at around 32.6 °C. In January, the average temperature is 24.3 °C, the lowest of the year. The average temperatures vary during the year by 8.3 °C. In a year, the average rainfall is 1219 mm. In winter, there is much less rainfall than in summer. The variation in the precipitation between the driest and wettest months is 309 mm. \nThe town has a collection of 7th and 8th century religious monuments that has been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is on the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, about south of Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India.\n\nThe site has 40 ancient monuments and Hindu temples, including Descent of the Ganges or Arjuna's Penance – one of the largest open-air rock relief in the world. The site includes several categories of monuments: \"ratha\" temples with an architecture of monolith processional chariots built between 630 and 668 CE; the mandapa viharas with halls and stone roofs with narratives from the \"Mahabharata\", Shaktism and Vaishnavism; rock reliefs particularly bas-reliefs of Shaivism, Shaktism and Vaishnavism; stone cut temples particularly those dedicated to Shiva that also reverentially display Vishnu and others, built between 695 and 722 CE; and, archaeological excavations with inscriptions some dated to 6th century and earlier. The cave temples and monolithic temples were built during the Pallava Period. The site is managed by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\nSome important structures include:\n\n India census, Mahabalipuram had a population of 12,345. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Mahabalipuram has an average literacy rate of 74%, higher than the national average of 73%: male literacy is 82%, and female literacy is 66%. In Mahabalipuram, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "871470", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=871470", "title": "Mutual intelligibility", "text": "Mutual intelligibility\n\nIn linguistics, mutual intelligibility is a relationship between languages or dialects in which speakers of different but related varieties can readily understand each other without prior familiarity or special effort. It is sometimes used as an important criterion for distinguishing languages from dialects, although sociolinguistic factors are often also used.\n\nIntelligibility between languages can be asymmetric, with speakers of one understanding more of the other than speakers of the other understanding the first. When it is relatively symmetric, it is characterized as \"mutual\". It exists in differing degrees among many related or geographically proximate languages of the world, often in the context of a dialect continuum.\n\nLinguistic distance is the name for the concept of calculating a measurement for how different languages are from one another. The higher the linguistic distance, the lower the mutual intelligibility. One common metric used is the Levenshtein distance.\n\nFor individuals to achieve moderate proficiency or understanding in a language (called L2) other than their first language (L1) typically requires considerable time and effort through study and/or practical application. However, many groups of languages are partly mutually intelligible, i.e. most speakers of one language find it relatively easy to achieve some degree of understanding in the related language(s). Often the languages are genetically related, and they are likely to be similar to each other in grammar, vocabulary, pronunciation, or other features.\n\nIntelligibility among languages can vary between individuals or groups within a language population according to their knowledge of various registers and vocabulary in their own language, their exposure to additional related languages, their interest in or familiarity with other cultures, the domain of discussion, psycho-cognitive traits, the mode of language used (written vs. oral), and other factors.\n\nThere is no formal distinction between two distinct languages and two varieties of a single language, but some linguists use mutual intelligibility as one of the primary factors in deciding between the two cases.\n\nSome linguists claim that mutual intelligibility is, ideally at least, the primary criterion separating languages from dialects. On the other hand, speakers of closely related languages can often communicate with each other; thus there are varying degrees of mutual intelligibility, and often other criteria are also used. As an example, in the case of a linear dialect continuum that shades gradually between varieties, where speakers near the center can understand the varieties at both ends, but speakers at one end cannot understand the speakers at the other end, the entire chain is often considered a single language. If the central varieties then die out and only the varieties at both ends survive, they may then be reclassified as two languages, even though no actual language change has occurred.\n\nIn addition, political and social conventions often override considerations of mutual intelligibility. For example, the varieties of Chinese are often considered a single language even though there is usually no mutual intelligibility between geographically separated varieties. Another similar example would be varieties of Arabic. In contrast, there is often significant intelligibility between different Scandinavian languages, but as each of them has its own standard form, they are classified as separate languages. There is also significant intelligibility between Thai languages of different regions of Thailand.\n\nTo deal with the conflict in cases such as Arabic, Chinese and German, the term \"Dachsprache\" (a sociolinguistic \"umbrella language\") is sometimes seen: Chinese and German are languages in the sociolinguistic sense even though some speakers cannot understand each other without recourse to a standard or prestige form.\n\nAsymmetric intelligibility refers to two languages that are considered partially mutually intelligible, but where one group of speakers has more difficulty understanding the other language than the other way around. There can be various reasons for this. If, for example, one language is related to another but has simplified its grammar, the speakers of the original language may understand the simplified language, but less vice versa. For example, Dutch speakers tend to find it easier to understand Afrikaans than vice versa as a result of Afrikaans's simplified grammar.\n\nPerhaps the most common reason for apparent asymmetric intelligibility is that speakers of one variety have more exposure to the other than vice versa. For example, speakers of Scottish English have frequent exposure to standard American English through movies and TV programs, whereas speakers of American English have little exposure to Scottish English; hence, American English speakers often find it difficult to understand Scottish English or, especially, Scots (which differs significantly from standard Scottish English), whereas Scots tend to have few problems understanding standard American English.\n\nNorthern Germanic languages spoken in Scandinavia form a dialect continuum where two furthermost dialects have almost no mutual intelligibility. As such, spoken Danish and Swedish normally have low mutual intelligibility, but Swedes in the Öresund region (including Malmö and Helsingborg), across a strait from the Danish capital Copenhagen, understand Danish somewhat better, largely due to the proximity of the region to Danish-speaking areas (see \"Mutual intelligibility in North Germanic languages\"). While Norway was under Danish rule, the Bokmål written standard of Norwegian originates from Dano-Norwegian, a koiné that evolved among the urban elite in Norwegian cities during the later years of the union. Additionally, Norwegian assimilated a considerable amount of Danish vocabulary as well as traditional Danish expressions. As a consequence, spoken mutual intelligibility is not reciprocal.\n\nSimilarly, in Germany and Italy, standard German or Italian speakers may have great difficulty understanding the \"dialects\" from regions other than their own, but virtually all \"dialect\" speakers learn the standard languages in school and from the media.\n\nBelow is an \"incomplete\" list of fully and partially mutually intelligible varieties sometimes considered languages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the difficulty of imposing boundaries on a continuum, various counts of the Romance languages are given; in \"The Linguasphere register of the world’s languages and speech communities\" David Dalby lists 23 based on mutual intelligibility:\n\n\n\n"}

It was published posthumously, in 1855; three years after Azevedo's death. The book is structured as a frame story containing five tales (as well as a prologue and an epilogue, thus totaling seven chapters) told by a group of five men sheltering in a tavern. It is one of the most popular and influential works of Gothic fiction in Brazilian literature.\n\nIt is said that the book was largely inspired by Spanish author José Cadalso's 1790 work \"Noches lúgubres\".\n\nThe first chapter of the book, \"Uma Noite do Século\" (\"A Night of the Century\"), introduces its setting – a tavern in an undisclosed location filled with prostitutes, drunkards and libertines. At a nearby table, influenced by the alcohol, a group of five friends – Solfieri, Bertram, Gennaro, Claudius Hermann and Johann – decide to share with each other certain events of their lives. The five tales have, in common, aspects such as unsuccessful love stories, cannibalism, murders, sexual violence, heavy drinking, among others.\n\nWhen in Rome, on a rainy night, Solfieri sees a shadow crying over a window. He realizes it is a beautiful woman. She leaves the house and Solfieri decides to follow her, and they ultimately arrive at a nearby cemetery. There, the woman cries, kneeling before a headstone, as Solfieri falls asleep watching her from afar.\n\nOne year later, Solfieri, wandering the streets of Rome after taking part in an orgy, ends into a church inadvertently. He sees a coffin and, after listening to breathing noises inside, opens it, and sees the cemetery lady he met the year before inside it. After realizing that she is still alive (but in a catalepsic state), he carries her through the city. Arriving at his home, the woman dies two days later, of a very high fever. Solfieri buries her under the floorboards of his bedroom and pays a sculptor for a statuette built in the woman's likeness.\n\nBertram tells the story of his ill-fated love for a Spanish woman from Cádiz, named Angela. Amidst their romance, Bertram's sick father, living in Denmark, calls for him. He goes, returning two years later; however, during the time he was away, Angela marries another man, having a son with him. Despite this, Bertram tries to maintain his affair with her, but Angela's husband finds out everything. Before her husband kills her, she kills him and her child, and flees with Bertram.\n\nOne day, without further explanations, she leaves him. Bertram sinks into despair as he tries to forget Angela; subdued by woe, he faints in the middle of a street and is run over by a chariot. The passengers of the chariot, an old man and his 18-year-old daughter, help him and take him to their mansion so he can recover. Bertram gets in love with the lady and they flee together, but he ultimately gets bored with her and sells the lady to a pirate in a card game. Later, he would learn that the girl poisoned the pirate and threw herself in the sea.\n\nHaving moved to Italy, Bertram decides to kill himself there, but when he is about to do it, he is saved by a sailor whom he kills unintentionally. Bertram spends some time in the sailor's ship (a corvette), where he gets in love with the captain's wife, being requited.\n\nIn the midst of this affair, the ship is attacked by pirates and sinks, but not without making the other one sink too. The captain, his wife, Bertram and two other unnamed sailors are able to save themselves in a raft. Some time later, with no water or food, the two unnamed sailors being washed out by the sea, the three lot in order to discover who will be killed and serve as food for the others. The chosen one is the captain, but he does not accept his fate and fights for his life. He loses the fight however, and Bertram and the woman are obligated to eat him because of the lack of food, maintaining themselves for two days.\n\nArriving at a beach, both already weakened by hunger, the woman asks Bertram for a last moment of love before her death. Afraid of dying, Bertram strangles her and lives at the beach in complete solitude until he is found by a British brig that rescues him.\n\nThe painter Gennaro reminisces of when he was the young apprentice of the famous Godofredo Walsh. Walsh had a young, beautiful wife named Nauza (whom Gennaro loved) and a young, beautiful daughter named Laura (who loved Gennaro). One day, Laura gets pregnant of Gennaro, but when she proposes marriage to him, he declines. Displeased, she gradually sinks into depression and dies, taking the baby with her.\n\nThe old painter, not knowing anything, visits his daughter's bedroom every night and, because of this, Gennaro starts sleeping with his wife. However, the painter is able to make Gennaro confess everything in a certain night. Days later, Godofredo takes Gennaro to a cliff and tries to kill him; however, he survives the fall and decides to return to Godofredo's house – initially planning to apologize, but later he changes his mind and decides to take his revenge on the painter and murder him. However, when he arrives at the painter's house, he finds both Nauza and Godofredo dead.\n\nClaudius Hermann, an assiduous gambler, spots the beautiful Duchess Eleonora at a horse race and falls in love with her at first sight. He meets her once more in a theatre later on, and during an entire week he stalks her.\n\nIn a certain night, he bribes one of the duchess' lackeys for permission to enter her house for an hour, and also obtains a copy of her bedroom's keys. He puts sedative in the duchess' wine and has sex with her, returning for many nights.\n\nOne day, however, her husband, Duke Maffio, inadvertently drinks some of the sedative as well. Desperate and afraid of being caught, Claudius plans to kill him, but changes his mind and kidnaps Eleonora instead while she is still sleeping. Arriving in an inn, she wakes up, and Claudius tells her everything, forcing her to stay with him. Optionless, she accepts.\n\nSome days later, Claudius has to leave in order to take care of some affairs; when he returns home, he finds the duchess and her husband dead.\n\nJohann's story begins in a different tavern, located in Paris. He was playing a game of carambole with a blond-haired man named Arthur. Johann was losing the game, while Arthur only needed to score one point to win. When it is Johann's turn to play, Arthur bumps into the table (accidentally or not), detouring Johann's ball, thus making him lose the game. Infuriated, he defies Arthur to a duel, which he accepts. They stop at a hotel to get the guns, and the blond man writes two letters. They head to a deserted and dark street. In there, they choose their guns – but only one is loaded.\n\nThey shoot. It is revealed that Johann's gun was the loaded one, and Arthur, before supposedly dying, hands Johann the letters he wrote. The first letter is addressed to Arthur's mother, and the other one is addressed to his girlfriend; he also hands Johann her address and an engagement ring. Pretending to be Arthur, Johann then decides to steal his girlfriend.\n\nIn the morning after they sleep together, Johann is attacked by a mysterious man. After a short struggle, he kills the man. However, after a close inspection, he discovers that the man he killed was his own brother, and Arthur's girlfriend was his sister.\n\nIn the last chapter, \"Último Beijo de Amor\" (\"Last Love Kiss\"), the orgy ends; everyone is sleeping. A mysterious hooded figure walks into the tavern and kills Johann, and then heads toward a man named Arnold.\n\nThe figure is revealed to be Giorgia, Johann's sister, and Arnold is actually Arthur (who was saved by a passerby after the duel) under a false name. Giorgia reveals to Arthur that she wanted to get her revenge on Johann, and having done so, the honor Johann stole from her when they slept together is finally restored.\n\nAfter exchanging some love words with Arthur, both decide to commit suicide.\n\nAn independent short film based on the book received a limited release around some Brazilian film festivals and arthouse cinemas on March 6, 2014. Directed and written by Yghor Boy, it stars Renato Basilla as Solfieri, Renan Bleastè as Bertram, Hélcio Henriques as Gennaro, Raul Figueiredo as Claudius Hermann, Sérgio Siveiro as Johann, Ricardo Merini as Arnold/Arthur and Mayara Constantino as Giorgia. Intertwined between each tale are glimpses of the academic life of Álvares de Azevedo himself, who is portrayed by Victor Mendes.\n\nThe film won the Prêmio ABC de Cinematografia for Best Direction of Photography in a Student Film in May 2015.\n\n"}

{"id": "2770302", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2770302", "title": "Paris meridian", "text": "Paris meridian\n\nThe Paris meridian is a meridian line running through the Paris Observatory in Paris, France—now longitude 2°20′14.03″ east. It was a long-standing rival to the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian of the world. The Paris meridian arc or French meridian arc (French: \"la Méridienne de France\") is the name of the meridian arc measured along the Paris meridian. The French meridian arc was important for French cartography, inasmuch as the triangulations of France began with the measurement of the French meridian arc. Moreover, the French meridian arc was important for geodesy as it was one of the meridian arcs which were measured in order to determine the figure of the Earth. The determination of the figure of the earth was a problem of the highest importance in astronomy, inasmuch as the diameter of the earth was the unit to which all celestial distances had to be referred.\n\nIn the year 1634, France ruled by Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu decided that the Ferro meridian should be used as the reference on maps, since this island is the most western position of the Old World. It was also thought to be exactly 20 degrees west of Paris.\n\nA French astronomer, Abbé Jean Picard, measured the length of a degree of latitude along the Paris meridian and computed from it the size of the Earth during 1668–1670. In 1666, Louis XIV of France had authorized the building of an observatory in Paris. On Midsummer's Day 1667, members of the Academy of Sciences traced the future building's outline on a plot outside town near the Port Royal abbey, with Paris meridian exactly bisecting the site north-south. French cartographers would use it as their prime meridian for more than 200 years.\n\nOld maps from continental Europe often have a common grid with Paris degrees at the top and Ferro degrees offset by 20 at the bottom. Louis Feuillée also worked on this problem in 1724.\nIt was later found that the actual island of El Hierro itself is in fact 20° 31'  west of Paris, but the Ferro meridian was still defined as 20 degrees west of Paris.\n\nFour generations of the Cassini family headed the Paris Observatory. They directed the surveys of France for over 100 years.\n\nBetween 1684 and 1718 Giovanni Domenico Cassini and Jacques Cassini, starting from Picard’s base, carried a triangulation northwards from Paris to Dunkirk and southwards from Paris to Collioure. They measured a base of 7246 toises near Perpignan, and a somewhat shorter base near Dunkirk; and from the northern portion of the arc, which had an amplitude of 2° 12′ 9″, obtained for the length of a degree 56,960 toises; while from the southern portion, of which the amplitude was 6° 18′ 57″, they obtained 57,097 toises. The immediate inference from this was that, the degree diminishing with increasing latitude, the earth must be a prolate spheroid. This conclusion was totally opposed to the theoretical investigations of Newton and Huygens, and accordingly the Academy of Sciences of Paris determined to apply a decisive test by the measurement of arcs at a great distance from each other—one in the neighbourhood of the equator, the other in a high latitude. Thus arose the celebrated expeditions of the French academicians to the Equator and to Lapland, the latter directed by Pierre Louis Maupertuis.\nIn 1740 was published in the Paris \"Mémoires\" an account, by Cassini de Thury, of a remeasurement by himself and Nicolas Louis de Lacaille of the meridian of Paris. With a view to determine more accurately the variation of the degree along the meridian, they divided the distance from Dunkirk to Collioure into four partial arcs of about two degrees each, by observing the latitude at five stations. The results previously obtained by Giovanni Domenico and Jacques Cassini were not confirmed, but, on the contrary, the length of the degree derived from these partial arcs showed on the whole an increase with an increasing latitude.\n\nCesar-François Cassini de Thury completed the Cassini map, which was published by his son Cassini IV in 1790. Moreover, the Paris meridian was linked with international collaboration in geodesy and metrology. Cesar-François Cassini de Thury (1714-1784) expressed the project to extend the French geodetic network all around the world and to connect the Paris and Greenwich observatories. In 1783 the French Academy of Science presented his proposal to King George III. This led to the Paris and Greenwich observatories' connection by General William Roy and the first triangulation of Great Britain. France and Great Britain surveys' connection was repeated by French astronomers and geodesists in 1787 by Cassini IV, in 1823-1825 by François Arago and in 1861-1862 by François Perrier.\n\nBetween 1792 and 1798 Pierre Méchain and Jean-Baptiste Delambre surveyed the Paris meridian arc between Dunkirk and Barcelona. They extrapolated from this measurement the distance from the North Pole to the Equator which was 5 130 740 toises. As the metre had to be equal to one ten-million of this distance, it was defined as 0,513074 toises or 443,2936 lignes of the Toise of Peru (see below).\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Paris meridian's arc was recalculated with greater precision between Shetland and the Balearic Islands by the astronomer François Arago, whose name now appears on the plaques or medallions tracing the route of the meridian through Paris (see below). Biot and Arago published their work as a fourth volume following the three volumes of \"Bases du système métrique décimal ou mesure de l'arc méridien compris entre les parallèles de Dunkerque et Barcelone\" (Basis for the decimal metric system or measurement of the meridian arc comprised between Dunkirk and Barcelona) by Delambre and Méchain.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero directed the survey of Spain. From 1870 to 1894 the Paris meridan's arc was remeasured by Perrier and Bassot in France and Algeria. In 1879, Ibáñez de Ibero for Spain and François Perrier for France directed the junction of the Spanish geodetic network with Algeria. This connection was a remarkable enterprise where triangles with a maximum length of 270 km were observed from mountain stations over the Mediterranean Sea. The triangulation of France was then connected to those of Great Britain, Spain and Algeria and thus the Paris meridian's arc measurement extended from Shetland to the Sahara.\n\nThe fundamental co-ordinates of the Panthéon were also obtained anew, by connecting the Panthéon and the Paris Observatory with the five stations of Bry-sur-Marne, Morlu, Mont Valérien, Chatillon and Montsouris, where the observations of latitude and azimuth were effected.\n\nIn 1860, the Russian Government at the instance of Otto Wilhelm von Struve invited the Governments of Belgium, France, Prussia and England to connect their triangulations in order to measure the length of an arc of parallel in latitude 52° and to test the accuracy of the figure and dimensions of the Earth, as derived from the measurements of arc of meridian. In order to combine the measurements it was necessary to compare the geodetic standards of length used in the different countries. The British Government invited those of France, Belgium, Prussia, Russia, India, Australia, Austria, Spain, United States and Cape of Good Hope to send their standards to the Ordnance Survey office in Southampton. Notably the geodetic standards of France, Spain and United States were based on the metric system, whereas those of Prussia, Belgium and Russia where calibrated against the toise, of which the oldest physical representative was the Toise of Peru. The Toise of Peru had been constructed in 1735 for Bouguer and De La Condamine as their standard of reference in the French Geodesic Mission, conducted in actual Ecuador from 1735 to 1744 in collaboration with the Spanish officers Jorge Juan and Antonio de Ulloa.\n\nAlexander Ross Clarke and Henry James published the first results of the standards' comparisons in 1867. The same year Russia, Spain and Portugal joined the \"Europäische Gradmessung\" and the General Conference of the association proposed the metre as a uniform length standard for the Arc measurement and recommended the establishment of an International Metre Commission.\n\nThe \"Europäische Gradmessung\" decided the creation of an international geodetic standard at the General Conference held in Paris in 1875. The Metre Convention was signed in 1875 in Paris and the International Bureau of Weights and Measures was created under the supervision of the International Committee for Weights and Measures. The first president of the International Committee for Weights and Measures was the Spanish geodesist Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero. He also was the president of the Permanent Commission of the \"Europäische Gradmessung\" from 1874 to 1886. In 1886 the association changed name for the International Geodetic Association (German: \"Internationale Erdmessung\") and Carlos Ibáñez e Ibáñez de Ibero was reelected as president. He remained in this position until his death in 1891. During this period the International Geodetic Association gained worldwide importance with the joining of United States, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Japan. In 1883 the General Conference of the \"Europäische Gradmessung\" proposed to select the Greenwich meridian as the prime meridian in the hope that Great Britain would accede to the Metre Convention.\n\nThe United States passed an Act of Congress on 3 August 1882 authorizing the President to call an international conference to fix on a common prime meridian for time and longitude throughout the world. Before the invitations were sent out on December 1, the joint efforts of Abbe, Fleming and William Frederick Allen, Secretary of the US railways' \"General Time Convention\" and Managing Editor of the \"Travellers' Official Guide to the Railways\", had brought the US railway companies to an agreement which led to standard railway time being introduced at noon on 18 November 1883 across the nation. Although this was not legally established until 1918, there was thus a strong sense of \"fait accompli\" that preceded the International Meridian Conference, although setting local times was not part of the remit of the conference.\n\nIn 1884, at the International Meridian Conference in Washington DC, the Greenwich meridian was adopted as the prime meridian of the world. San Domingo, now the Dominican Republic, voted against. France and Brazil abstained. The United Kingdom acceded to the Metre Convention in 1884 and to the International Geodetic Association in 1898. In 1911, Alexander Ross Clarke and Friedrich Robert Helmert stated in the Encyclopædia Britannica :\n\n\"According to the calculations made at the central bureau of the international association on the great meridian arc extending from the Shetland Islands, through Great Britain, France and Spain to El Aghuat in Algeria, \"a\" [the equatorial radius of the earth] = 6377935 metres, the ellipticity being assumed as 1/299.15. [...] The net does not follow the meridian exactly, but deviates both to the west and to the east; actually, the meridian of Greenwich is nearer the mean than that of Paris (Helmert, \"Grösse d. Erde\").\"\n\nThe French clung to the Paris meridian as a rival to Greenwich until 1911 for timekeeping purposes and 1914 for navigation. To this day, French cartographers continue to indicate the Paris meridian on some maps.\n\nWith the arrival of wireless telegraphy, France established a transmitter on the Eiffel Tower in order to broadcast a time signal. The creation of the International Time Bureau, seated at the Paris Observatory, was decided upon during the 1912 \"Conférence internationale de l'heure radiotélégraphique\". The following year an attempt was made to regulate the international status of the bureau through the creation of an international convention. However, the convention wasn't ratified by its member countries due to the outbreak of World War I. In 1919, after the war, it was decided upon to make the bureau the executive body of the \"International Commission of Time\", one of the commissions of the then newly founded International Astronomical Union (IAU).\n\nFrom 1956 until 1987 the International Time Bureau was part of the Federation of Astronomical and Geophysical Data Analysis Services (FAGS). In 1987 the bureau's tasks of combining different measurements of Atomic Time were taken over by the BIPM. Its tasks related to the correction of time with respect to the celestial reference frame and the earth's rotation in order to realize UTC were taken over by the IERS.\n\nIn 1994 the Arago Association and the city of Paris commissioned a Dutch conceptual artist, Jan Dibbets, to create a memorial to Arago. Dibbets came up with the idea of setting 135 bronze medallions (although only 121 are documented in the official guide to the medallions) into the ground along the Paris meridian between the northern and southern limits of Paris: a total distance of 9.2 kilometres/5.7 miles. Each medallion is 12 cm in diameter and marked with the name ARAGO plus N and S pointers.\n\nAnother project, the Green Meridian (\"An 2000 — La Méridienne Verte\"), aims to establish a plantation of trees along the entire length of the meridian arc in France. Several missing Arago medallions appear to have been replaced with the newer 'An 2000 — La Méridienne Verte' markers.\n\nIn certain circles, some kind of occult or esoteric significance is ascribed to the Paris meridian; sometimes it is even perceived as a sinister axis. Dominique Stezepfandts, a French conspiracy theorist, attacks the Arago medallions that supposedly trace the route of \"an occult geographical line\"; to him the Paris meridian is a \"Masonic axis\" or even \"the heart of the Devil.\"\n\nHenry Lincoln, in his book \"The Holy Place\", argues that various ancient structures are aligned according to the Paris meridian. They even include medieval churches, built long before the meridian was established according to conventional history, and Lincoln finds it obvious that the meridian \"was based upon the 'cromlech intersect division line'.\" David Wood, in his book \"Genesis\", likewise ascribes a deeper significance to the Paris meridian and takes it into account when trying to decipher the geometry of the myth-encrusted village of Rennes-le-Château: The meridian passes about 350 meters (1,150 ft) west of the site of the so-called \"Poussin tomb,\" an important location in the legends and esoteric theories relating to that place. (A skeptical discussion of these theories, including the supposed \"alignments,\" can be found in Bill Putnam and Edwin Wood's book \"The Treasure of Rennes-le-Château - A mystery solved\".)\n\n\n\n"}

The village of Gorna Krepost (\"Upper Fortress\") is located at the foot of the hill and the gold-bearing Perpereshka River flows near it. Perperikon is the largest megalith ensemble in the Balkans.\n\nIt is thought that the famous Temple of Dionysius is located at this location. A visitor centre is being constructed at a cost of 2.4 million Euros funded by the EU.\n\nBulgarian archaeologist Nikolay Ovcharov started the excavation works at Perperikon in 2000, and revealed the remains of ancient architectural complex.\n\nHuman activity in the area dates back to 5000 B.C. The first traces of civilization on the hill date from the Bronze Age, while the ceramics found on the place date from the Early Iron Age, as well as the impressive round altar, almost 2 m in diameter, hewn out of the rocks. At Perperikon, a twelve days' journey from the sea, Medokos called himself king of Thrace after Sitalces's death in 424 BC, but failed to hold a throne.\n\nArchaeologists have uncovered a giant multi-story palace and an imposing fortress built around the hill, with walls as thick as 2.8 m. This dates from the time of the Roman Empire. Temples and residential quarters were also constructed in the fortress. The megalithic complex has been laid in ruins and re-erected many times throughout history.\n\nThe name Perperikon (originally Hyperperakion, shortened by scribes to Perperakion or Perperikon) dates from the Middle Ages. There are at least two theories about the origin and meaning of the name, both associating it with gold and the gold-mining done in the region.\n\nA church pulpit was found by Bulgarian archeologists at the peak of the Thracian rock sanctuary on 10 September 2005. It is thought to be the first finding of the kind in Bulgaria. The pulpit was probably built at the end of the 4th century AD or the early 5th century during the reign of Byzantine Arcadius and coincided with the period of the christening of the Thracians in the Rhodopes area.\n\nIt has the form of a single nave basilica of 16.5 m length, which is the most typical form of an early Christian religious temple. The pulpit, which is almost untouched by time, is richly decorated with stone-carved ornaments. An eagle with widespread wings is clearly seen on the rock. It also bears five inscriptions in Greek, which are yet to be explained but which archaeologists suppose are liturgical writings.\n\nOne hypothesis suggests the church existed until the 14th century when it was levelled by the Ottoman invaders. At about that time it was probably sealed up and abandoned.\n\nPerperek Knoll on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after the settlement of Perperek in connection with the Thracian holy city of Perperikon.\n\n\n"}

This later Midas was, however, also the last independent king of Phrygia before Cimmerians sacked the Phrygian capital, Gordium, around 695 BC. Phrygia then became subject to Lydia, and then successively to Persia, Alexander and his Hellenistic successors, Pergamon, Rome and Byzantium. Phrygians gradually became assimilated into other cultures by the early medieval era; after the Turkish conquest of Anatolia, the name \"Phrygia\" passed out of usage as a territorial designation.\n\nPhrygia describes an area on the western end of the high Anatolian plateau, an arid region quite unlike the forested lands to the north and west. Phrygia begins in the northwest where an area of dry steppe is watered by the Sakarya and Porsuk river system and is home to the settlements of Dorylaeum near modern Eskisehir, and the Phrygian capital Gordion. The climate is harsh with hot summers and cold winters; olives will not easily grow here and the land is mostly used for livestock grazing and the production of barley. South of Dorylaeum, there is another important Phrygian settlement, Midas City (Yazılıkaya, Eskişehir), situated in an area of hills and columns of volcanic tuff.\nTo the south again, central Phrygia includes the cities of Afyonkarahisar (ancient Akroinon) with its marble quarries at nearby Docimium (İscehisar), and the town of Synnada.\nAt the western end of Phrygia stood the towns of Aizanoi (modern Çavdarhisar) and Acmonia. From here to the southwest lies the hilly area of Phrygia that contrasts to the bare plains of the region's heartland. Southwestern Phrygia is watered by the Maeander (Büyük Menderes River) and its tributary the Lycus, and contains the towns of Laodicea on the Lycus and Hierapolis.\n\nInscriptions found at Gordium make clear that Phrygians spoke an Indo-European language with at least some vocabulary similar to Greek, and clearly not belonging to the family of Anatolian languages (such as Hittite) spoken by most of Phrygia's neighbors. One of the so-called Homeric Hymns describes the Phrygian language as not mutually intelligible with that of Troy.\nAccording to ancient tradition among Greek historians, the Phrygians anciently migrated to Anatolia from the Balkans. Herodotus says that the Phrygians were called Bryges when they lived in Europe. He and other Greek writers also recorded legends about King Midas that associated him with or put his origin in Macedonia; Herodotus, for example, says a wild rose garden in Macedonia was named after Midas. Some classical writers also connected the Phrygians with the Mygdones, the name of two groups of people, one of which lived in northern Macedonia and another in Mysia. Likewise, the Phrygians have been identified with the Bebryces, a people said to have warred with Mysia before the Trojan War and who had a king named Mygdon at roughly the same time as the Phrygians were said to have had a king named Mygdon. The classical historian Strabo groups Phrygians, Mygdones, Mysians, Bebryces and Bithynians together as peoples that migrated to Anatolia from the Balkans. This image of Phrygians as part of a related group of northwest Anatolian cultures seems the most likely explanation for the confusion over whether Phrygians, Bebryces and Anatolian Mygdones were or were not the same people.\n\nThe apparent similarity of the Phrygian language to Greek and its dissimilarity with the Anatolian languages spoken by most of their neighbors is also taken as support for a European origin of the Phrygians. Phrygian continued to be spoken until the 6th century AD, though its distinctive alphabet was lost earlier than those of most Anatolian cultures.\n\nSome scholars have theorized that such a migration could have occurred more recently than classical sources suggest, and have sought to fit the Phrygian arrival into a narrative explaining the downfall of the Hittite Empire and the end of the high Bronze Age in Anatolia. According to this \"recent migration\" theory, the Phrygians invaded just before or after the collapse of the Hittite Empire at the beginning of the 12th century BC, filling the political vacuum in central-western Anatolia, and may have been counted among the \"Sea Peoples\" that Egyptian records credit with bringing about the Hittite collapse. The so-called Handmade Knobbed Ware found in Western Anatolia during this period has been tentatively identified as an import connected to this invasion.\n\nHowever, most scholars reject such a recent Phrygian migration and accept as factual the \"Iliad\"'s account that the Phrygians were established on the Sakarya River before the Trojan War, and thus must have been there during the later stages of the Hittite Empire, and probably earlier. These scholars seek instead to trace the Phrygians' origins among the many nations of western Anatolia who were subject to the Hittites. This interpretation also gets support from Greek legends about the founding of Phrygia's main city Gordium by Gordias and of Ancyra by Midas, which suggest that Gordium and Ancyra were believed to date from the distant past before the Trojan War. Some scholars dismiss the claim of a Phrygian migration as a mere legend, likely arising from the coincidental similarity of their name to the Bryges.\n\nNo one has conclusively identified which of the many subjects of the Hittites might have represented early Phrygians. According to a classical tradition, popularized by Josephus, Phrygia can be equated with the country called Togarmah by the ancient Hebrews, which has in turn been identified as the Tegarama of Hittite texts and Til-Garimmu of Assyrian records. Josephus called Togarmah \"the Thrugrammeans, who, as the Greeks resolved, were named Phrygians\". However, the Greek source cited by Josephus is unknown, and it is unclear if there was any basis for the identification other than name similarity. Scholars of the Hittites believe Tegarama was in eastern Anatolia - some locate it at Gurun - far to the east of Phrygia. Some scholars have identified Phrygia with the Assuwa league, and noted that the \"Iliad\" mentions a Phrygian (Queen Hecuba's brother) named Asios. Another possible early name of Phrygia could be Hapalla, the name of the easternmost province that emerged from the splintering of the Bronze Age western Anatolian empire Arzawa. However, scholars are unsure if Hapalla corresponds to Phrygia or to Pisidia, further south.\n\nHerodotus also claims that Phrygian colonists founded the Armenian nation. This is likely a reference to a third group of people called Mygdones living in northern Mesopotamia who were apparently allied to the Armenians; Xenophon describes them in his \"Anabasis\" in a joint army with the Armenians. However, little is known about these eastern Mygdones, and no evidence of Phrygian language in that region has been found.\n\nEric P. Hamp in his 2012 Indo-European family tree classified the Phrygian language together with Italo-Celtic as a member of a \"Northwest Indo-European\" group. In Hamp's view, Northwest Indo-Europeans are likely to have been the first inhabitants of Hallstatt with the Pre-Phrygians moving east and south to Anatolia in the same manner as the Galatians did later on. In 2010, Raymund Carl mentions that the Lausitz culture was one such Hallstatt-associated culture.\n\nAccording to the Iliad, the homeland of the Phrygians was on the Sangarius River, which would remain the centre of Phrygia throughout its history. Phrygia was famous for its wine and had \"brave and expert\" horsemen.\n\nAccording to the Iliad, before the Trojan War, a young king Priam of Troy had taken an army to Phrygia to support it in a war against the Amazons. Homer calls the Phrygians \"the people of Otreus and godlike Mygdon\". According to Euripides, Quintus Smyrnaeus and others, this Mygdon's son, Coroebus, fought and died in the Trojan War; he had sued for the hand of the Trojan princess Cassandra in marriage. The name \"Otreus\" could be an eponym for Otroea, a place on Lake Ascania in the vicinity of the later Nicaea, and the name \"Mygdon\" is clearly an eponym for the Mygdones, a people said by Strabo to live in northwest Asia Minor, and who appear to have sometimes been considered distinct from the Phrygians. However, Pausanias believed that Mygdon's tomb was located at Stectorium in the southern Phrygian highlands, near modern Sandikli.\nAccording to the \"Bibliotheca\", the Greek hero Heracles slew a king Mygdon of the Bebryces in a battle in northwest Anatolia that if historical would have taken place about a generation before the Trojan War. According to the story, while traveling from Minoa to the Amazons, Heracles stopped in Mysia and supported the Mysians in a battle with the Bebryces. According to some interpretations, Bebryces is an alternate name for Phrygians and this Mygdon is the same person mentioned in the Iliad.\n\nKing Priam married the Phrygian princess Hecabe (or Hecuba) and maintained a close alliance with the Phrygians, who repaid him by fighting \"ardently\" in the Trojan War against the Greeks. Hecabe was a daughter of the Phrygian king Dymas, son of Eioneus, son of Proteus. According to the Iliad, Hecabe's younger brother Asius also fought at Troy (see above); and Quintus Smyrnaeus mentions two grandsons of Dymas that fell at the hands of Neoptolemus at the end of the Trojan War: \"Two sons he slew of Meges rich in gold, Scion of Dymas - sons of high renown, cunning to hurl the dart, to drive the steed in war, and deftly cast the lance afar, born at one birth beside Sangarius' banks of Periboea to him, Celtus one, and Eubius the other.\" Teleutas, father of the maiden Tecmessa, is mentioned as another mythical Phrygian king.\n\nThere are indications in the Iliad that the heart of the Phrygian country was further north and downriver than it would be in later history. The Phrygian contingent arrives to aid Troy coming from Lake Ascania in northwest Anatolia, and is led by Phorcys and Ascanius, both sons of Aretaon.\n\nIn one of the so-called Homeric Hymns, Phrygia is said to be \"rich in fortresses\" and ruled by \"famous Otreus\".\n\nDuring the 8th century BC, the Phrygian kingdom with its capital at Gordium in the upper Sakarya River valley expanded into an empire dominating most of central and western Anatolia and encroaching upon the larger Assyrian Empire to its southeast and the kingdom of Urartu to the northeast.\n\nAccording to the classical historians Strabo, Eusebius and Julius Africanus, the king of Phrygia during this time was another Midas. This historical Midas is believed to be the same person named as Mita in Assyrian texts from the period and identified as king of the Mushki. Scholars figure that Assyrians called Phrygians \"Mushki\" because the Phrygians and Mushki, an eastern Anatolian people, were at that time campaigning in a joint army. This Midas is thought to have reigned Phrygia at the peak of its power from about 720 BC to about 695 BC (according to Eusebius) or 676 BC (according to Julius Africanus). An Assyrian inscription mentioning \"Mita\", dated to 709 BC, during the reign of Sargon of Assyria, suggests Phrygia and Assyria had struck a truce by that time. This Midas appears to have had good relations and close trade ties with the Greeks, and reputedly married an Aeolian Greek princess.\n\nA system of writing in the Phrygian language developed and flourished in Gordium during this period, using a Phoenician-derived alphabet similar to the Greek one. A distinctive Phrygian pottery called Polished Ware appears during this period.\n\nHowever, the Phrygian Kingdom was then overwhelmed by Cimmerian invaders, and Gordium was sacked and destroyed. According to Strabo and others, Midas committed suicide by drinking bulls' blood.\nA series of digs have opened Gordium as one of Turkey's most revealing archeological sites. Excavations confirm a violent destruction of Gordium around 675 BC. A tomb from the period, popularly identified as the \"Tomb of Midas\", revealed a wooden structure deeply buried under a vast tumulus, containing grave goods, a coffin, furniture, and food offerings (Archaeological Museum, Ankara).\n\nAfter their destruction of Gordium, the Cimmerians remained in western Anatolia and warred with Lydia, which eventually expelled them by around 620 BC, and then expanded to incorporate Phrygia, which became the Lydian empire's eastern frontier. The Gordium site reveals a considerable building program during the 6th century BC, under the domination of Lydian kings including the proverbially rich King Croesus. Meanwhile, Phrygia's former eastern subjects fell to Assyria and later to the Medes.\n\nThere may be an echo of strife with Lydia and perhaps a veiled reference to royal hostages, in the legend of the twice-unlucky Phrygian prince Adrastus, who accidentally killed his brother and exiled himself to Lydia, where King Croesus welcomed him. Once again, Adrastus accidentally killed Croesus' son and then committed suicide.\n\nSome time in the 540s BC, Phrygia passed to the Achaemenid (Great Persian) Empire when Cyrus the Great conquered Lydia.\n\nAfter Darius the Great became Persian Emperor in 521 BC, he remade the ancient trade route into the Persian \"Royal Road\" and instituted administrative reforms that included setting up satrapies. The Phrygian satrapy (province) lay west of the Halys River (now Kızıl River) and east of Mysia and Lydia. Its capital was established at Dascylium, modern Ergili.\n\nIn the course of the 5th century, the region was divided in two administrative satrapies : Hellespontine Phrygia and Greater Phrygia.\n\nThe Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great passed through Gordium in 333 BC and severed the Gordian Knot in the temple of Sabazios (\"Zeus\"). According to a legend, possibly promulgated by Alexander's publicists, whoever untied the knot would be master of Asia. With Gordium sited on the Persian Royal Road that led through the heart of Anatolia, the prophecy had some geographical plausibility. With Alexander, Phrygia became part of the wider Hellenistic world. Upon Alexander's death in 323, the Battle of Ipsus took place in 301 BC.\n\nIn the chaotic period after Alexander's death, northern Phrygia was overrun by Celts, eventually to become the province of Galatia. The former capital of Gordium was captured and destroyed by the Gauls soon afterwards and disappeared from history.\nIn 188 BC, the southern remnant of Phrygia came under the control of the Attalids of Pergamon. However, the Phrygian language survived, although now written in the Greek alphabet.\n\nIn 133 BC, the remnants of Phrygia passed to Rome. For purposes of provincial administration, the Romans maintained a divided Phrygia, attaching the northeastern part to the province of Galatia and the western portion to the province of Asia. During the reforms of Diocletian, Phrygia was divided anew into two provinces: \"Phrygia I\", or Phrygia Salutaris, and Phrygia II, or Pacatiana, both under the Diocese of Asia. Salutaris with Synnada as its capital comprised the eastern portion of the region and Pacatiana with Laodicea on the Lycus as capital of the western portion. The provinces survived up to the end of the 7th century, when they were replaced by the Theme system. In the Byzantine period, most of Phrygia belonged to the Anatolic theme. It was overrun by the Turks in the aftermath of the Battle of Manzikert (1071). The Byzantines were finally evicted from there in the 13th century, but the name of \"Phrygia\" remained in use until the last remnant of the Byzantine Empire was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1453.\n\nThe ruins of Gordion and Midas City prove that Phrygia had developed an advanced Bronze Age culture. This Phrygian culture interacted in a number of ways with Greek culture in various periods of history.\n\nThe \"Great Mother\", Cybele, as the Greeks and Romans knew her, was originally worshiped in the mountains of Phrygia, where she was known as \"Mountain Mother\". In her typical Phrygian form, she wears a long belted dress, a \"polos\" (a high cylindrical headdress), and a veil covering the whole body. The later version of Cybele was established by a pupil of Phidias, the sculptor Agoracritus, and became the image most widely adopted by Cybele's expanding following, both in the Aegean world and at Rome. It shows her humanized though still enthroned, her hand resting on an attendant lion and the other holding the \"tympanon\", a circular frame drum, similar to a tambourine.\n\nThe Phrygians also venerated Sabazios, the sky and father-god depicted on horseback. Although the Greeks associated Sabazios with Zeus, representations of him, even in Roman times, show him as a horseman god. His conflicts with the indigenous Mother Goddess, whose creature was the Lunar Bull, may be surmised in the way that Sabazios' horse places a hoof on the head of a bull, in a Roman relief at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nThe earliest traditions of Greek music derived from Phrygia, transmitted through the Greek colonies in Anatolia, and included the Phrygian mode, which was considered to be the warlike mode in ancient Greek music. Phrygian Midas, the king of the \"golden touch\", was tutored in music by Orpheus himself, according to the myth. Another musical invention that came from Phrygia was the aulos, a reed instrument with two pipes. \n\nMarsyas, the satyr who first formed the instrument using the hollowed antler of a stag, was a Phrygian follower of Cybele. He unwisely competed in music with the Olympian Apollo and inevitably lost, whereupon Apollo flayed Marsyas alive and provocatively hung his skin on Cybele's own sacred tree, a pine. Phrygia was also the scene of another musical contest, between Apollo and Pan. Midas was either a judge or spectator, and said he preferred Pan's pipes to Apollo's lyre, and was given donkey's ears as a punishment. The two stories were often confused or conflated, as by Titian. \n\nClassical Greek iconography identifies the Trojan Paris as non-Greek by his Phrygian cap, which was worn by Mithras and survived into modern imagery as the \"Liberty cap\" of the American and French revolutionaries.\nThe Phrygians spoke an Indo-European language. (\"See Phrygian language.\") Although the Phrygians adopted the alphabet originated by the Phoenicians, only a few dozen inscriptions in the Phrygian language have been found, primarily funereal, and so much of what is thought to be known of Phrygia is second-hand information from Greek sources.\n\nThe name of the earliest known mythical king was Nannacus (aka Annacus). This king resided at Iconium, the most eastern city of the kingdom of Phrygia at that time; and after his death, at the age of 300 years, a great flood overwhelmed the country, as had been foretold by an ancient oracle. The next king mentioned in extant classical sources was called Manis or Masdes. According to Plutarch, because of his splendid exploits, great things were called \"manic\" in Phrygia. Thereafter, the kingdom of Phrygia seems to have become fragmented among various kings. One of the kings was Tantalus, who ruled over the north western region of Phrygia around Mount Sipylus. Tantalus was endlessly punished in Tartarus, because he allegedly killed his son Pelops and sacrificially offered him to the Olympians, a reference to the suppression of human sacrifice. Tantalus was also falsely accused of stealing from the lotteries he had invented. In the mythic age before the Trojan war, during a time of an interregnum, Gordius (or Gordias), a Phrygian farmer, became king, fulfilling an oracular prophecy. The kingless Phrygians had turned for guidance to the oracle of Sabazios (\"Zeus\" to the Greeks) at Telmissus, in the part of Phrygia that later became part of Galatia. They had been instructed by the oracle to acclaim as their king the first man who rode up to the god's temple in a cart. That man was Gordias (Gordios, Gordius), a farmer, who dedicated the ox-cart in question, tied to its shaft with the \"Gordian Knot\". Gordias refounded a capital at Gordium in west central Anatolia, situated on the old trackway through the heart of Anatolia that became Darius's Persian \"Royal Road\" from Pessinus to Ancyra, and not far from the River Sangarius.\nThe Phrygians are associated in Greek mythology with the Dactyls, minor gods credited with the invention of iron smelting, who in most versions of the legend lived at Mount Ida in Phrygia.\n\nGordias's son (adopted in some versions) was Midas. A large body of myths and legends surround this first king Midas. connecting him with a mythological tale concerning Attis. This shadowy figure resided at Pessinus and attempted to marry his daughter to the young Attis in spite of the opposition of his lover Agdestis and his mother, the goddess Cybele. When Agdestis and/or Cybele appear and cast madness upon the members of the wedding feast. Midas is said to have died in the ensuing chaos.\n\nKing Midas is said to have associated himself with Silenus and other satyrs and with Dionysus, who granted him a \"golden touch\".\n\nIn one version of his story, Midas travels from Thrace accompanied by a band of his people to Asia Minor to wash away the taint of his unwelcome \"golden touch\" in the river Pactolus. Leaving the gold in the river's sands, Midas found himself in Phrygia, where he was adopted by the childless king Gordias and taken under the protection of Cybele. Acting as the visible representative of Cybele, and under her authority, it would seem, a Phrygian king could designate his successor.\n\nThe Phrygian Sibyl was the priestess presiding over the Apollonian oracle at Phrygia.\n\nAccording to Herodotus, the Egyptian pharaoh Psammetichus II had two children raised in isolation in order to find the original language. The children were reported to have uttered \"bekos\", which is Phrygian for \"bread\", so Psammetichus admitted that the Phrygians were a nation older than the Egyptians.\n\nVisitors from Phrygia were reported to have been among the crowds present in Jerusalem on the occasion of Pentecost as recorded in . In the Apostle Paul and his companion Silas travelled through Phrygia and the region of Galatia proclaiming the Christian gospel. Their plans appear to have been to go to Asia but circumstances or guidance, \"in ways which we are not told, by inner promptings, or by visions of the night, or by the inspired utterances of those among their converts who had received the gift of prophecy\" prevented them from doing so and instead they travelled westwards towards the coast.\n\nThe Christian heresy known as Montanism, and still known in Orthodoxy as \"the Phrygian heresy\", arose in the unidentified village of Ardabau in the 2nd century AD, and was distinguished by ecstatic spirituality and women priests. Originally described as a rural movement, it is now thought to have been of urban origin like other Christian developments. The new Jerusalem its adherents founded in the village of Pepouza has now been identified in a remote valley that later held a monastery.\n\n\n\n"}

Lawrence moved from New Jersey to Palmyra, New York, with sister Fanny and her husband Abner Cole. Lawrence and Smith reportedly engaged in \"money-digging\" (or treasure hunting).\n\nLater Lawrence moved to Oswego, New York, where he died.\n\nLawrence was born in New Jersey to Sylvanus and Jemima Lawrence. He had an older brother, Daniel, and an adopted sister, Frances \"Fanny\" Wickham Darling, a biological first cousin who was adopted into the family and took the last name Lawrence.\n\nBy 1811, Lawrence and Rachel Bryant (born 1793) were married, and the two had at least one daughter, Frances Maria.\n\nAround 1820, Lawrence and his family moved to Palmyra. Samuel's sister Fanny and her husband Abner Cole had resided in Palmyra since 1812.\n\nIn Palmyra, Lawrence developed a reputation as a seer and a treasure-hunter.

Lawrence figures in some of the discovery narratives of the golden plates.\n\nWillard Chase recalled in 1833 that Smith had been told by a spirit \"to come again, in just one year, and bring a man with him\". According to Chase, Smith at one point \"believed that one Samuel T. Lawrence was the man alluded to by the spirit\" and reportedly took Lawrence \"to a singular looking hill, in Manchester, and showed him where the treasure was.\" According to the account, Smith later changed his mind and decided Lawrence was not the \"right man\".\n\nJoseph Knight, Sr. recalled that \"Joseph was some afraid of Samuel Lawrence that he might be a trouble to him.\" Therefore, prior to retrieving the golden plates on September 22, 1827, Smith sent his father to Lawrence's residence \"to see if there was any signs of his going away that night.\"\n\nIn her 1853 book, Lucy Mack Smith recalled her husband's visit to the Lawrence house, writing that \"he could overhear their conversation\" and they were \"devising many plans and schemes to find 'Joe Smith's gold bible'.\" Reportedly, Lawrence's wife warned her husband \"'Sam, Sam,' said she.

{"id": "43106703", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43106703", "title": "Signalism", "text": "Signalism\n\nSignalism ( / Signalizam; from: lat. Signum – \"sign, signal\") represents an international neo-avant-garde literal and art movement. It gathered wider support base both in former Yugoslavia and the world in the late 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s.\n\nThe beginning of Signalism dates back to 1959 when its founder and main theoretician Miroljub Todorović started with his linguistic experiments. His main belief was that there can be no significant leap forward in poetry without revolutionizing its main medium – the language.\n\nThe birth of Signalism in Serbian literature and culture, with its tendency to revolutionize other arts as well (visual, theater, comics, music and movies), came from the need to eliminate the spent models carried on by poetic and cultural traditions, as well as from the necessity to take on the challenges and spirit of the modern technological and electronic civilization. In its program (\"Manifesto\" and other guiding texts) as well as in its art pieces, Signalism made a clean break from the principles of neoromantism and late symbolism still governing Serbian literature. Its goal was set to radically change poetry both through content and form, and make it compatible with the contemporary times.\n\nRevolutionizing of the poetic language started with the introduction of the symbols, formulas and linguistic forms of the \"hard\" sciences (physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, biochemistry and astronomy). Furthermore, the language was made visual by dispersing words and sentences into syllables and letters forming visually recognizable patterns, as well as by introducing non-verbal symbols into the text (drawings, photographs, graphs…) for the purpose of creating a collage of verbal and visual elements. This first phase of Signalism is often referred to as \"Scientism\", with the most prominent examples including the books \"Planeta\" (Planet, 1965) and \"Putovanje u Zvezdaliju\" (A trip to Starland, 1971) as well as poetry cycles \"Belančevina\" (Protein), \"Kiseonik\" (Oxygen), \"Ožilište\" (Nursery) and others in which the topics are Space, Time and Matter.\n\nIn their for decade long research and creative pursuit that followed, Signalists significantly expanded cognitive boundaries and genre profile of modern Serbian poetry. Signalist poetry can be divided into two main forms: verbal and non-verbal. Verbal poetry consists of scientist, aleatoric (random), stochastic, technological, phenomenological, slang and apeironistic poetry. Non-verbal poetry subtypes include visual, object, sound and gestual poetry.\n\nSignalism made significant advances in prose (experimental novel and short story). There is also a number of significant Signalist children literature accomplishments. In visual art strides are made in body art, mail art, performance and conceptual art.\n\nThree manifestos helped define Signalism as a neo-avant-garde movement that negates literal, artistic and cultural heritage, poetic and aesthetic conventions and canonical ways of creativity by insisting on creative experimentation – \"Manifesto of scientific poetry\" (1968), \"Signalist manifesto (Regulae poesis)\" (1969) and \"Signalism\" (1970).\n\nThe movement was significantly boosted by the international magazine \"Signal\", inaugurated in 1970. Nine issues of \"Signal\" appeared between 1970 and 1973, presenting a number of domestic and international artists, as well as printing bibliographical data about the avant-garde publications all around the world. From 1973 until 1995 magazine could not be published, mainly for financial reasons. From 1995 to 2004 another 21 issues of \"Signal\" appeared. The new release of \"Signal\" revitalized the Signalist movement and brought an army of young artists into the movement in 21st century.\n\nOn the work of Miroljub Todorović and Signalism movement that he had founded, three doctoral dissertations have been defended: Dr. Julian Kornhauser, Jagiellonian University in Kraków, Poland, 1980; Dr. Živan Živković, Faculty of Philology in Belgrade, 1991 and Dr. Milivoje Pavlović, University of Kosovska Mitrovica, 2002. Twenty monographs have also been published on the same subject.\n\n\nThree anthologies were also published in Serbia: \"Signalist poetry\" (1971), \"Concrete, visual and signalist poetry\" (1975), \"Mail-Art Mail-Poetry\" (1980), as well as several collections and almanacs.\n\nMany poets, writers and painters accepted the basic concepts of Signalism, further developing and spreading the ideas of this Serbian (Yugoslav) neo-avant-garde movement.\n\nBesides the founder of Signalism Miroljub Todorović (\"Kyberno\", 1970; \"The Pig is an Excellent Swimmer\", 1971; \"Bumpkin Shows Off\", slang poetry, 1974; \"Insect on the Temple\", 1978; \"Algol\", 1980, \"Textum\", 1981; \"Chinese Erotism\", 1983; \"Knock-Out\", 1984; \"I Mount Rocinante Again\", 1987; \"Water-Snake Drinks Water\", 1988; \"The Diary of Avant-Garde\", 1990; \"Electric Chair\", slang poetry, 1998; \"I’ve Just Opened my Mail\", 2000; \"It Walked Into my Ear\", slang stories, 2005; \"Blue Wind\", 2006; \"Slang Stories\", 2007;) important contributors to the theory and practice of Signalism include Marina Abramović, Vlada Stojiljković, Zvonimir Kostić Palanski, Slobodan Pavićević (\"Flowers’ Silicates\", 1973; \"Roadworks\", 1984), Milivoje Pavlović (\"White Book\", 1974; \"The World In Signals\", 1996), Zoran Popović, Ljubiša Jocić (\"Moonshine in Tetrapack\", 1975; \"What’s the Time\", 1976: \"Essays on Signalism\", 1994), Jaroslav Supek, Zvonko Sarić (\"Overcoat until the Dawn\", 2001; \"Soul Catcher\", 2003), Bogislav Marković (\"Altai Dust\", 2006), Ilija Bakić (\"Prenatal Life\", 1997; \"New Babylon\", 1998; \"Protoplasm\", 2003; \"The Autumn of Gatherers\", 2007; \"To be Continued\", 2009), Slobodan Škerović (\"Indigo\", 2005; \"All Colors of Arcturus\", 2006; \"Chimera or Borg\", 2008), Žarko Đurović (\"The World of Signalism\", 2002), Dušan Vidaković, Dobrivoje Jevtić, Dejan Bogojević, Andrej Tišma, Dobrica Kamperelić, Milivoj Anđelković, Zoran Stefanović and others.\n\nNumerous domestic and international critics and theoreticians hold Signalism in high regard:\n\nProf. Miloš Bandić: \"Signalism is – after Zenitism, Surrealism and the movement of social literature – the next and autochthonous literary and artistic movement in Serbian literature of 20th century. At the same time, in contemporary Yugoslav literature and culture, Signalism is confirmed as an exclusive modern dimension and a separate artistic form and production. Without it all would probably be poorer and who knows how deprived.\"\n\nOskar Davičo, famous writer: \"For the first time from the appearance of Surrealism in the twenties, we can joyfully confirm that with exploration of Miroljub Todorović, Serbian poetry can again catch up with the genuine worldwide avant-garde explorations.\"\n\nZoran Markuš, visual arts critic: \"Signalism is our parallel phenomena within the brackets of the most extreme avant-garde and that explains its international expansion, approval and importance in certain artistic and intellectual circles.\"\n\nDave Oz, Canadian multimedia artist: \"True essence of Signalism is that it expects appearance of planetary consciousness.\"\n\nGillo Dorfles, Italian arts theoretician: \"Signalism means a step forward, in relation to concrete poetry, visual poetry and the art of the sign.\"\n\nProf. Milivoje Pavlović: \"Thanks to Miroljub Todorović and the group that follows him, Signalism with its mainstream represents the arc which connects in a creative manner avant-garde aims from the period between wars with the contemporary epoch, bringing valuable innovations and connecting Serbian art with the modern world’s processes.\" (From the book \"The Keys of Signalist Poetics\")\n\n\n\n"}

The project is under the academic auspices of Bar Ilan University and until 2017 was funded by the Ir David Foundation and Israel Exploration Society. \n\nIn April 2017, the project announced that the Ir David Foundation suddenly decided to stop funding the project and, as a result, the sifting part of the project would be closed. Also the funding that was promised to them by Benjamin Netanyahu has never been received. The project has since started to raise money using crowdfunding. The target is 250,000 Israeli new shekel in order to complete the study of the items that were already found.Since 2017 the project has been funded by the Israel Archaeology Foundation.\n\nThe renovation of Solomon's Stables, which is 18,000 square feet (1,700 m) and 36 feet (11 m) deep, entailed excavating layers of earth accumulated near its northern archways since medieval times.\nThe project necessitated the use of heavy earth moving equipment. About 60 truckloads full of stones and earth were taken to an organic garbage dump in nearby al-Eizariya, and could not be retrieved, but most of the debris (about 350 truckloads) was dumped in the Kidron Valley, near the north-eastern corner of the old city.\n\nUnder the supervision of Israeli archaeologists Gabriel Barkay and Zachi Dvira (Zweig) of Bar Ilan University, the soil is being sifted in search of artifacts.\n\nDore Gold has called the removal of archaeological material from the Temple Mount without archaeological supervision, by the Waqf, a physical form of Denial of the Temple in Jerusalem.\n\nThe work is being carried out at a site in the Emek Tzurim National Park, at the foot of Mt. Scopus. Hundreds of artifacts have been found, including coins and jewelry, some with biblical links dating back more than three millennia. The workers use a technique called \"wet sifting,\" similar to panning for gold. Every particle is examined, using wire filters that are rinsed under water. The work is being done inside a large greenhouse covered in plastic sheets. The contents of black plastic buckets filled with stones and pebbles are emptied onto wooden-framed screens, hosed down and sorted for items of potential importance.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2017 the sifting of material from the Temple Mount was stopped because of the shortage of funds. The Temple Mount Sifting project team is planning to resume the sifting as soon as they have procured the funding necessary to complete and publish the research on the half a million artifacts that have already been found. \n\nThough the team still does not have the government funding necessary to restart the sifting, everybody can still help. For supporters, the sifting project team is offering tours of their research laboratory where everyone can see all of their special finds and learn about them from one of the expert archaeologists.\n\nThese tours are a way of saying thank you to the Temple Mount Sifting project supporters. For these gifts, the donation collected goes to support their project’s research and the process of resuming the sifting itself.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Essays and Resources on the Experimentalization of Life, 1830-1930, located at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science, is dedicated to research in the history of the experimentalization of life. The term experimentalization describes the interaction between the life sciences, the arts, architecture, media and technology within the experimental paradigm, ca. 1830 to 1930. The Virtual Laboratory is a platform that not only presents work on this topic but also acts as a research environment for new studies.\n\nIn 1977, the first version of the Virtual Laboratory was presented, titled Virtual Laboratory of Physiology. At this time, the main focus lay on the development of technological preconditions of physiological research in the 19th century. Therefore, a database with relevant texts and images was created. In 1998, the concept still used today was created after a series of modifications, followed by the publication of a cd-ROM in 1999. At this time, the focus had been expanded from physiology to the life sciences in general, as well as the arts and literature. As the project had been extended from a sole database to a platform for historiographical research, it was presented at the conference \"Using the World Wide Web for Historical Research in Science and Technology\" organized by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation at Stanford University. In 2000, the project was incorporated into the research project \"The Experimentalization of Life\", funded by the Volkswagen Foundation. This was followed by another presentation at the conference \"Virtual Research? The impact of new technologies on scientific practices\" at the ETH Zurich. In 2002, the first version of the Virtual Laboratory went online. Since 2008, the Virtual Laboratory is listed as a journal under the ISSN number 1866-4784.\n\nThe Virtual Laboratory consists of two parts: The archive holds a large number of digitized texts and images as well as data sheets compiled from these resources, the laboratory holds historiographical work on the experimentalization of life as well as a working environment to enable new ways of writing history.\nThe Virtual Laboratory is composed of 8 sections:\nAll materials are available as pdf downloads.\n\nApart from these thematical sections, \"tools\" and \"myLab\" offer the possibility to use the Virtual Laboratory as a research environment. It is possible to create specific collections from the available materials, work on them and share them with other users.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "480905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=480905", "title": "Write-in candidate", "text": "Write-in candidate\n\nA write-in candidate is a candidate in an election whose name does not appear on the ballot, but for whom voters may vote nonetheless by writing in the person's name. The system is almost totally confined to elections in the United States. Some U.S. states and local jurisdictions allow a voter to affix a sticker, with the write-in candidate's name, to the ballot in lieu of actually writing in the candidate's name. Write-in candidacies are sometimes a result of a candidate being legally or procedurally ineligible to run under his or her own name or party; write-in candidacies may be permitted where term limits bar an incumbent candidate from being officially nominated for, or being listed on the ballot for, re-election. In some cases, write-in campaigns have been organized to support a candidate who is not personally involved in running; this may be a form of draft campaign.\n\nWrite-in candidates rarely win, and sometimes write-in votes are cast for ineligible people or fictional characters. Some jurisdictions require write-in candidates be registered as official candidates before the election. This is standard in elections with a large pool of potential candidates, as there may be multiple candidates with the same name that could be written in.\n\nMany U.S. states and municipalities allow for write-in votes in a partisan primary election where no candidate is listed on the ballot to have the same functional effect as nominating petitions: for example, if there are no Reform Party members on the ballot for state general assembly and a candidate receives more than 200 write-in votes when the primary election is held (or the other number of signatures that were required for ballot access), the candidate will be placed on the ballot on that ballot line for the general election. In most places, this provision is in place for non-partisan elections as well.\n\nThe term \"write-in candidate\" is used in elections in which names of candidates or parties are preprinted on a paper ballot or displayed on an electronic voting machine. The term is not generally used in elections in which all ballots are blank and thus all voters must write in the names of their preferred candidates. Blank ballot election systems reduce the cost of printing the ballots, but increase the complexity of casting and counting votes. Such systems are used in Japan, and used in the past in the French Second Republic, and in elections in the Philippines from World War 2 until the 2010 general election. Blank-ballot systems typically require candidates to be nominated in advance.\n\nGenerally, write-in candidates can compete in any election within the United States. Typically, write-in candidates have a very small chance of winning, but there have been some strong showings by write-in candidates over the years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2010, California voters passed Proposition 14 which set up a new election system for the United States Senate, United States House of Representatives, all statewide offices (governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, state treasurer, state controller, attorney general, insurance commissioner, and superintendent of public instruction), California Board of Equalization, and for the California State Legislature. In the system set up by Proposition 14, there are two rounds of voting, and the top two vote-getters for each race in the first round (the primary, normally held in June) advance to a second round (the general election, held in November). Proposition 14 specifically prohibits write-in candidates in the second round, and this prohibition was upheld in a court challenge. Another court challenge to the prohibition on write-in candidates in the second round was filed in July 2014.\n\nAlthough Proposition 14 prohibits write-in candidates in the second round of voting, it has made it easier for write-in candidates in the first round to advance to the second round. This generally happens in elections where only one candidate is listed on the ballot. Since in each race the top two vote-getters from the first round are guaranteed to advance to the second round, if only one candidate is listed on the ballot, a write-in candidate can easily advance to the second round, as the write-in candidate would only have to compete with other write-in candidates for the 2nd spot, not with any listed candidates. In some jungle primary systems, if the winner in the first round wins by more than 50% of the vote, then the second (runoff) round gets cancelled, but in the system set up by Proposition 14, a second (runoff) round is required regardless of the percent of the vote that the winner of the first round received. Proposition 14 therefore guarantees that if one candidate is listed on the ballot in the first round, a write-in candidate running against the one listed candidate can earn a spot for the second round with as little as one vote.\n\nThe first election in which Proposition 14 went into effect was the 2012 elections.\n\nAnother impact of Proposition 14 on write-in candidates is that since Proposition 14, candidates who are not affiliated with any party can be listed on the ballot for election to offices affected by Proposition 14. Prior to passage of Proposition 14, candidates who were not affiliated with any party, could not run in any party primaries, and were required to run in the general election as write-in candidates.\n\nWith a few exceptions, the practice of recognizing write-in candidates is typically viewed internationally as an American tradition.\n\n\n\n\n"}
