It is a pastiche or remaking of a well-known photographic portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono that was made by Annie Leibovitz a few hours before Lennon's murder.\n\nThe photo \"made a splash in the British art scene in 1993.\" The work was exhibited as part of the exhibition Brilliant! held at the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, USA, in 1995.\n\nIn his 2001 book \"High Art Lite\", art historian Julian Stallabrass states that the Bond/Taylor-Wood version offers a \"reversal of gender roles\" (however, the original also has Lennon and Ono in the same position). Stallabrass also states that:\nThe work refers to naïve 1960s idealism, though not entirely mockingly, rather asking the viewer to contrast the situation in the 1990s with the 1960s ... for such artists, it is clear we are living in a time of the twilight of ideals.\n\nCommenting on the photo-work in 2010, Taylor-Wood said: The bizarre thing is that I'd completely forgotten about that piece until it was brought up in an interview ... I don't remember what drove us to make it. Must have been high concept in there somewhere, but God knows what it was. I guess there's a running interest in male vulnerability in my work, so maybe it's just that.\n\nThe authorship of this artwork has been contested with both artists, at different times, assuming control of the image and asserting origination/intellectual property; indeed, it has been suggested that the photographer that the pair hired to shoot the photograph also later claimed authorship of it.\n\nThe photograph is 23in x 19in (58.5 x 48.5 cm.); on 23 October 2001, the photograph was offered at an art auction held by Christie's Auctioneers, \"work number five from an edition of five,\" sold for $15,059.\n\n"}
{"id": "3561968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3561968", "title": "A Corny Concerto", "text": "A Corny Concerto\n\nA Corny Concerto is a 1943 American animated collection of two musical segments produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions and distributed by Warner Bros. It was directed by Bob Clampett, written by Frank Tashlin, animated by Robert McKimson and released as part of the \"Merrie Melodies\" series on September 18, 1943. A parody of Disney's 1940 feature \"Fantasia\", the film uses two of Johann Strauss' best known waltzes, \"Tales from the Vienna Woods\" and \"The Blue Danube\", adapted by the cartoon unit's music director, Carl Stalling and orchestrated by its arranger and later, Stalling's successor, Milt Franklyn. Long considered a classic for its sly humor and impeccable timing with the music, it was voted # 47 of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation field in 1994. The title, in tune with the name of the unit's other cartoon series, \"Looney Tunes\", suggests another Disney titling parody, that of the pioneering series \"Silly Symphonies\".\n\nThis was the first WB cartoon ever to feature more than two of their major characters in starring roles (though not all appeared on screen at the same time). Elmer Fudd appears as the musicologist/composer (as Deems Taylor was in \"Fantasia\") introducing each segment. The first segment, \"Tales from the Vienna Woods\", stars Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig, the former as the prey and the latter (in his third color cartoon) as the hunter. This is one of only two cartoons in which both Bugs and Porky appear (the other, \"Dumb Patrol\" (1964) features Porky only briefly). In addition, a number of people consider the main character in the second segment, \"The Blue Danube\", to be a \"baby\" version of Daffy Duck. This is also the second time the Warner Bros. studio had lampooned \"Fantasia\"; \"Pigs in a Polka\" from 1942 had given a similar treatment to the works of Johannes Brahms, with the Three Little Pigs as the stars.\n\nThe film's name is explained in the first shot as Carnegie Hall, here called \"Corny-gie Hall\", becomes the setting for the stately appearance of a distinguished musicologist, most notably exemplified by Deems Taylor, who introduced \"Fantasia\". Pyotr Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1 is heard over the opening credits. The \"eminent personality\" here, presented in the same grandiose fashion as Taylor, turns out to be none other than Elmer Fudd (voiced by Arthur Q. Bryan) who, while wearing Deems Taylor-style eyeglasses, although notably oversized, exhibits all of his own familiar mannerisms, including the nervous giggle and characteristic rhotacism: \"And as we hear the whythmic stwains of the haunting wefwain, wisten to the wippwing whythm of the woodwinds, as it wolls awound and awound, and it comes out here...\"(quoting the lyrics to the popular song \"The Music Goes Round and Round\"). In a staple of cartoon humor, Elmer is unable to control his starched tuxedo shirt front, which keeps rolling up in the manner of a window shade into his face while he tries to introduce the \"Vienna Woods\" segment. He finally rips it away with one last giggle before the first segment. Returning for the introduction of the slightly-longer \"Blue Danube\" segment, he holds the ripped away tuxedo shirt front in place to cover himself in front, until he waves his arms to introduce the \"Blue Danube\", causing his trousers to fall down and eliciting a final giggle of embarrassment. The two introductions contain the only spoken words in the cartoon since, apart from a few isolated non-verbal vocal sounds and sound effects, the soundtrack of the musical segments consists of the Strauss waltzes.\n\nIn tune with the rhythm of Strauss' waltz, Porky Pig and his unnamed hunting dog are in the presumed woods of the title, as Porky, in the role usually reserved for Elmer Fudd's rabbit/duck hunter character, holds up the sign \"I'm hunting that @!!*@ rabbit!!\" (which turns out to be none other than Bugs Bunny) and the dog holds a sign of his own which simply states \"DITTO\". Other than the 1930s incarnation of Porky hunting a Bugs Bunny prototype in Ben \"Bugs\" Hardaway's and Cal Dalton's \"Porky's Hare Hunt\" (1938), this is Porky's sole outing as a \"rabbit hunter\", but since both Porky and Bugs are also bereft here of their familiar voices, the primary motivator of the plot becomes the expressiveness of the characters' \"balletic performance\". The \"@!!*@ rabbit\", to the beat of the music, chomps on his carrots, lifting his foot out of the hole to press the pedal to open the lid of his \"Rabbit Rubbish\" receptacle, tossing carrot stubs in and closing the lid. This alerts Porky's dog, who points to Bugs' hiding hole. Bugs' hands emerge from the hole, holding a book entitled Emily Post Etiquette, then turns to a page that states \"It ain't polite to point!\" at which he then slams the book shut on the spherical nose at the tip of the dog's snout. Bugs then emerges from his hole, standing on a theater-style elevated platform, pirouettes out like a ballerina, dance kicks the dog in the face and ties his tail to a tree, making the dog spring back and crash into the flimsy stump, breaking it over his head which knocks him senseless and causes him to burble his lips with his finger like a baby.\n\nPorky and the dog hide in a bush, only to find Bugs already there. Bugs confuses the duo and makes the dog jump in the bush, then runs out and pretends to be the dog, pointing to the bush. The dog pops out just before Porky pulls the trigger, followed by Bugs' grabbing the shotgun and throwing it into a tree's knothole, where a squirrel, irked by the entry of the object into his abode, fires the weapon. The impact of the gunshot causes each main character to assume his own fatal wounding. As Porky and the dog examine themselves and find no bullet mark, Bugs, appearing to be mortally hit, falls to the ground. Porky and the dog start mourning him, with the dog preparing a first aid kit while Porky tries to undo Bugs' fingers around his chest. However, once he does so, Bugs is revealed to have a baby blue bra underneath. Emitting a scream of feminine modesty, he rises as a ballerina wearing a tutu and pointe shoes that matches the same color of his bra, slapping Porky's face three times, ties them to each other with the bra, flipping his tutu to revealed his pink bloomers to the audience, and gracefully dances off into the distance, falling at the end of his dance, and leaving his two antagonists with puzzled and dismayed expressions on their faces.\n\nSet upon a cartoon representation of the title waterway, this parody of Disney's Silly Symphony cartoon, \"The Ugly Duckling\", is perfectly timed to the strains of the Strauss waltz. As the story opens, a mother swan is gliding with her brood, when a small black duck (which some animation historians have described as a possible representation of baby Daffy Duck, pre-dating \"Baby Looney Tunes\" by nearly 60 years) tries to join them. The mother angrily makes eyes at him and swats him away, and he swims away with a big red handprint on his backside. When the lonesome little duckling tries again, using his underwater bubble tactic, the mother becomes even angrier at the little pest, now floating encased in a big bubble, and slaps him back to the water.\n\nA large buzzard in a \"hep cat\" hairdo spots the troupe using his eyes which can extend and adjust to focus like binoculars. He hangs up an \"Out To Brunch\" sign and swoops down for his meal. Swimming behind them to the rhythm of the music, he sprinkles salt and pepper on one of the little swans, but the pepper makes the baby swan sneeze. Then, one by one, the buzzard picks off the baby swans (the third one propelled by a tiny outboard motor). He also picks up the little black duck, but immediately puts him back, stamping the apparently unpalatable creature with, as befits a World War II cartoon, a \"Rejected (unfit-for-military-service) 4F\" label. The mother swan turns around and, seeing her charges gone, panics, looks all over and lifts a rock and peers underneath it only to see the little duckling, and slams it back down on him, and then falls into a faint. The duckling tries to revive her by splashing her with a bucketful of the water she's already lying in, and sees the buzzard taking the baby swans away, and becomes enraged. Suddenly turning into a super-duck-fighter-plane, briefly shown morphed into a representation of the P-40 Warhawk fighter, he takes to the sky after the buzzard in hot pursuit, zooming past a clasp of trees which suddenly become alive as they react to the passing object. The buzzard sees the enraged duckling chasing him and literally turns yellow, dropping the baby swans, each of whom opens a little parachute on the way down, allowing them to drop safely. The duckling loops around and smashes head-on into the buzzard, now seemingly a symbolic representation of our wartime enemies and, as the buzzard is knocked out, hands him a drum of TNT and drops him from the sky. The impact with the ground causes the TNT drum to explode, killing the buzzard who is then seen strumming on a harp and floating towards some form of afterlife, held aloft by a balloon tied to his tail.\n\nThe final scene shows the heroic black duckling, savior of the family, as part of the mother swan's brood, quacking along to the rhythm of the waltz's finalé—with only his own little reflection in the water not paying attention. While the duckling himself turned off in another direction along with mother swan and her brood, his reflection happily quacks along with the music swimming straight, banging into a tree, then frantically zig-zags to catch up to him as the cartoon fades out.\n\n\"Fantasia\" was marketed to highbrow music fans; the Looney Tunes staff responded by violating the ivory tower of classical music and concert hall culture. The short parodies both \"Fantasia\"'s Silly Symphonies-derived balletic approach to storytelling. Elmer Fudd stands in for Deems Taylor and in an anti-highbrow gag, his starched shirtfront keeps erupting from his shirt to hit him on the face. This sets the stage for a comedic approach to storytelling.\n\nThe short can be seen on disc 4 of the \"\" DVD set and also appears in the documentary \"\". It can also be found on \"The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Vol. 1\" laserdisc, and the \"Looney Tunes Collectors Edition: Musical Masterpieces\" VHS.\n\nSince most of this cartoon has fallen into public domain (with the exception of the brief quotation of “The Music Goes Round and Round”), it has made frequent appearances on many gray-market VHS and DVD cartoon releases.\n\n"}

Gerteiny (born 1930) is an American author and scholar of Middle Eastern and African Studies, a specialist on the Islamic Republic of Mauritania, the Palestinian issue, and International Terrorism. Gerteiny posits that the \"imposition\" of Israel in Palestine by the International Community was an unprecedented historical blunder, and U.S. blind support of Israel, its strategy, policies and practices in the Occupied Territories as instrumental to the instability and chaos in the Middle East. Gerteiny shares with Richard Arens, Chaim Shatan, and Richard Falk—UN Special Rapporteur on Palestine Human Rights—among other, the belief that these practices may amount to genocide, based on the interpretive comments of the progenitor of the UN Genocide Convention, Raphael Lemkin. Gerteiny considers that the two states solution to the conflict in Palestine is fundamentally flawed, not only because of the intractable mutual claim to the whole former mandate by the warring parties, but also because of its fundamental meaning and importance to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the 3 branches of the Abrahamic Tradition. He has suggested that a more practical and equitable solution may be one patterned after the Helvetic model—an internationally neutralized \"Holy Land Confederation,\" with Jewish, Christian and Muslim cantons, and with Jerusalem as capital. In \"the Terrorist Conjunction,\" he further argues that \"bad foreign policy choices, when coupled with grievances in the Middle East, are a fuel that triggers terrorizing violence.\"\n\nBefore devoting his academic focus on the Middle East, Gerteiny was best known for his field work in, and expertise on the Islamic Republic of Mauritania hitherto unknown African territory, which mysteries he reported in books and journal articles.\n\nAs an academic, Gerteiny emphasized the fundamental importance of Tenure, Academic Freedom and Collegiality in the pursuit of truth, particularly at institutions of higher learning, and as president of the University of Bridgeport's Chapter of the American Association of University Professors, he led the longest higher education faculty strike in U.S. history in defense of these values, ultimately losing tenure and position, along with the striking faculty.\n\nGerteiny was born in Heliopolis, Egypt, where he was reared in the family’s French cultural tradition. He is the son of Officier d'Académie Georges J. Gerteiny, Secrétaire de l’Institut Français d’Archaéologie Orientale du Caire, and of Nabiha Sophie.\n\nAfter completing the primary education cycle at the Heliopolis Jesuit school, Gerteiny graduated from the Lycée Français du Caire, and in Europe, from Institut d'Etude et de Recherches Diplomatique de Paris (ILERI)http://www.ileri.fr/. He also took specialized courses at the Hague Academy of International Law. In New York, he attended Columbia University's Middle East Institute, and in 1963 was awarded a Ph.D. in Contemporary History from St. John's University. Gerteiny lectured and conducted graduate seminars at St. John's University's African Studies Center, as well as at the University of Bridgeport where he served as chairman of History; he also lectured worldwide.\n\nGerteiny was a research assistant to the late Charles Ammoun, Lebanon's Ambassador to UNESCO, on the Apartheid Project, a managing editor at Grolier, Inc., and he developed, produced and hosted \"As History Unfolds,\" a political discussion series on the University of Bridgeport (U.B-TV) public channel. Gerteiny served also as consultant on Mauritanian Affairs to the Peace Corps, to the PKNO-AURA, 1973 Solar Eclipse expedition to Mauritania, as well as to the Arizona State University's Meteoritic Institute, concerning their Chinguetti meteorite research planning project. He was a Senior Research Fulbright Scholar in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco where he studied the determinants of these nations foreign policies, and later served twice on the National Screening Committee for Fulbright Grants to the MENA region.\n\nHe was married in 1955 to Elizabeth Folsom Leppert, in Scarsdale, New York; they have 2 daughters and a son.\n\n"}

Gates, first published in 1931. The inventory of glyphs used in Gates' analysis was compiled and drawn from the Madrid, Dresden and Paris codices, rather than from monumental inscriptions and stelae. It was published at a time when the Maya script remained wholly undeciphered and the type of writing system the script represented was unknown and much debated among Mayanists. Gates' work represented one of the major attempts in this pre-decipherment era of Mayanist scholarship to catalogue and analyse Maya glyphs as a prelude to uncovering their meaning. In comprehensiveness it was later superseded by Günther Zimmermann's \"Die Hieroglyphen der Maya-Handschriften\" (1956), and then in particular by J. Eric S. Thompson's \"A Catalogue of Maya Hieroglyphs\" (1962), which became established as the \"de facto\" standard catalogue and analysis of its day.\n\nOnce it was realised in the latter half of the 20th century that the Maya script was largely logosyllabic in nature, Mayanist epigraphers beginning with Yuri Knorozov began a process of breakthroughs in the script's decipherment. Other key contributions and realisations—such as establishing that the stelae texts recorded actual history and real personages and events—led to the decipherment of a significant number of glyphs and texts, particularly from the 1970s onwards. While many of the interpretations put forward in the early catalogues by Gates \"et al.\" have been made redundant by the modern knowledge of the script, catalogues such as Gates' have retained their significance and utility as references and records—particularly for calendrical and astronomical data and interpretation.\n\nThe original edition was limited to 207 copies.

The Anti-Renters declared their independence from the manor system run by patroons, resisting tax collectors and successfully demanding land reform.\n\nThe incident began with the death of Stephen Van Rensselaer III in 1839. Van Rensselaer, who was described as having \"...proved a lenient and benevolent landowner\" was the patroon of the region at the time, and was a descendant of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, the first patroon of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. During his life, he preferred to allow rents to accumulate or to accept partial payment when tenants were in financial constraints. However, his leases also included a \"quarter-sale\" provision, which required tenants who sold their leases to pay Van Rensselaer one fourth of the sale price or one additional year's rent. The patroons owned all the land on which the tenants in the Hudson Valley lived, and used this feudal lease system to maintain control of the region. When he died, Van Rensselaer's will directed his heirs to collect outstanding rents and \"quarter sale\" payments to apply to the estate debts. When the heirs attempted to collect, tenants could not pay the amounts demanded, could not secure a favorable payment schedule from the heirs, and could not obtain relief in the courts, so they revolted. \n\nThe first mass meeting of tenant farmers leading to the Anti-Rent War was held at the top of the Helderberg mountains in Berne, New York on July 4, 1839. They issued a declaration of independence, promising: \"We will take up the ball of the Revolution where our fathers stopped it and roll it to the final consummation of freedom and independence of the masses.\"\n\nIn December 1839 the Anti-Renters repulsed a 500-man posse led by Albany County sheriff Michael Artcher and including William Marcy and John Van Buren. Governor William Seward threatened the rebels with 700 militiamen and obtained their surrender. However, an insurrection continued to smolder. Disguised \"Calico Indians\" resisted tax collection and law enforcement, sometimes tarring and feathering their enemies.\n\nIn January 1845, one hundred and fifty delegates from eleven counties assembled at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Berne to call for political action to redress their grievances.\n\nThe Anti-Rent War led to the creation of the Antirenter Party, which had a strong influence on New York State politics from 1846–51.\n\nNewly elected governor Silas Wright moved in 1845 to stamp out the Calico Indians, and pushed for a law which outlawed disguises. \n\nTrials of leaders of the revolt, charged with riot, conspiracy and robbery, were held in 1845. Participants as counsel in the trials included Ambrose L. Jordan, as leading counsel for the defense, and John Van Buren, the state attorney general, who personally conducted the prosecution. At the first trial, the jury came to no conclusion.\n\nDuring a re-trial in September 1845, the two leading counsels started a fist-fight in open court. Both were sentenced by the presiding judge, Justice John W. Edmonds, to \"solitary confinement in the county jail for 24 hours.\" At the conclusion of the trial, one defendant, Smith A. Boughton, was sentenced to life imprisonment. After the election of John Young as governor, who had the support of the Anti-Renters, he pardoned Boughton.\n\nThe New York Constitution of 1846 added provisions for tenants' rights, abolishing feudal tenures and outlawing leases lasting longer than twelve years. The remaining manors dissolved quickly as the patroons sold off the lands.\n\n\n\n"}

The theory identifies theoretical discrepancies between phonetics and phonology and aims to unify the two by treating them as low- and high-dimensional descriptions of a single system.\n\nUnification can be achieved by incorporating into a single model the idea that the physical system (identified with phonetics) constrains the underlying abstract system (identified with phonology), making the units of control at the abstract planning level the same as those at the physical level.\n\nThe plan of an utterance is formatted as a gestural score, which provides the input to a physically based model of speech production - the task dynamic model of Elliot Saltzman. The gestural score graphs locations within the vocal tract where constriction can occur, indicating the planned or target degree of constriction. A computational model of speech production developed at Haskins Laboratories combines articulatory phonology, task dynamics, and the Haskins articulatory synthesis system developed by Philip Rubin and colleagues.\n\n"}

When news of the Hatfields' preparations for war reached the McCoy side, the Hatfields were already en route to invade the McCoy territory, so Frank Phillips, the leader of the McCoy posse, rounded up every able man he could and led his posse to intercept the invading Hatfields. Both sides eventually met around the area of the Grapevine Creek on the West Virginia side of the Tug Fork River and began exchanging shots at each other. One group of the McCoy side managed to lure the Hatfields into one area of the battlefield while another group of McCoys moved to outflank them, which caused the Hatfields to suffer multiple casualties and made them retreat. A number of Hatfields did not manage to escape and were taken prisoner by the McCoys.\n\nAs a result of the McCoys scoring victory over the Hatfields and taking multiple prisoners both from the battle and prior to the battle, they put all of the Hatfield prisoners on trial with the permission of the Kentucky government for the various crimes they had committed during the feud, mainly the murder of the Randall McCoy's sons for killing Ellison Hatfield and the killing of one of his daughters during the New Year's Eve massacre.

This moves the important decision-making and planning powers within the center of the organisation.\n\nThe term has a variety of meanings in several fields. In political science, centralisation refers to the concentration of a government's power—both geographically and politically—into a centralized government.\n\n\"Centralisation of authority\" is defined as the systematic and consistent concentration of authority at a central point or in a person within the organization. This idea was first introduced in the Qin Dynasty of China. The Qin government was highly bureaucratic and was administered by a hierarchy of officials, all serving the First Emperor, Qin Shi Huang. The Qin Dynasty practised all the things that Han Feizi taught, allowing Qin Shi Huang to own and control all his territories, including those conquered from other countries. Zheng and his advisers ended feudalism in China by setting up new laws and regulations under a centralized and bureaucratic government with a rigid centralization of authority. Under this system, both the military and government thrived. This was because talented individuals were more easily identified and picked out to be trained for specialized functions.\n\n\nThe acts for the implementation are needed after delegation. Therefore, the authority for taking the decisions can be spread with the help of the delegation of the authority.\n\nThe centralisation of authority can be done immediately, if complete concentration is given at the decision-making stage for any position. The centralisation can be done with a position or at a level in an organisation. Ideally, the decision-making power is held by a few individuals.\n\nCentralisation of authority has several advantages and disadvantages. The benefits include:\n\n\nDisadvantages, on the other hand are as follows:\n\n\nAs written in V.I. Lenin’s book, \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism\", \"The remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism.\" He researched the development of production and decided to develop the concept of production as a centralised framework, from individual and scattered small workshops into large factories, leading the capitalism to the world. This is guided by the idea that once concentration of production develops into a particular level, it will become a monopoly, like party organisations of Cartel, Syndicate, and Trust.\n\nMost businesses deal with issues relating to the specifics of centralization or decentralization of decision-making. The key question is either whether the authority should manage all the things at the centre of a business (centralised), or whether it should be delegated far away from the centre (decentralised).\n\nThe choice between centralised or decentralised varies. Many large businesses necessarily involve some extent of decentralisation and some extent of centralisation when it begins to operate from several places or any new units and markets added.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3633214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3633214", "title": "Chimariko language", "text": "Chimariko language\n\nChimariko is an extinct language isolate formerly spoken in northern Trinity County, California, by the inhabitants of several independent communities. While the total area claimed by these communities was remarkably small, Golla (2011:87–89) believes there is evidence that three local dialects were recognized: \"Trinity River Chimariko,\" spoken along the Trinity River from the mouth of South Fork at Salyer as far upstream as Big Bar, with a principal village at Burnt Ranch; \"South Fork Chimariko,\" spoken around the junction of South Fork and Hayfork Creek, with a principal village at Hyampom; and \"New River Chimariko,\" spoken along New River on the southern slopes of the Trinity Alps, with a principal village at Denny.\n\nProposals linking Chimariko to other languages in various versions of the hypothetical Hokan family have been advanced. Roland Dixon suggested a relationship between Chimariko and the Shastan and Palaihnihan families. Edward Sapir's famous grouped Chimariko with Shastan, Palaihnihan, Pomoan, and the Karuk and Yana languages in a Hokan sub-grouping known as \"Northern Hokan\". A \"Kahi\" family consisting of Chimariko, Shastan, Palaihnihan, and Karuk has been suggested (appearing also within Sapir's 1929 \"Northern Hokan\"). Most specialists currently find these relationships to be undemonstrated, and consider Chimariko to remain best considered an isolate.\n\nStephen Powers collected the first word list from Chimariko speakers in 1875 (Golla, 2011, p. 89). Soon after, Jeremiah Curtin documented a substantial amount of information (p. 89). Roland Dixon began work on the Chimariko language in the early 1900s, when there were few remaining speakers. Dixon worked with two: Mrs. Dyer and a man who was named Friday. While doing work with nearby Hupa, Edward Sapir collected data and also commented on the earlier Dixon work (Golla, 2011, p. 89). Later, extensive documentation on the language was carried out by J.P. Harrington, who worked with Sally Noble, the last speaker of the language. None of this work has been published, but slides of all of Harrington's work can be viewed on the Smithsonian Institution's website. Harrington's assistant John Paul Marr also made recordings of the language with speaker Martha Zigler. George Grekoff collected previous works of linguistics intending to write a grammar, but died before it was completed (Golla, 2011, p. 89).\nThe last Chimariko speaker was Martha Ziegler who died in the 1950s (Golla, 2011, p. 89). According to Golla, \"[m]odern Chimariko descendants, organized as the Tsnungwe Tribe (from Hupa \"cʰe:niŋxʷe:\" 'Ironside Mountain people') and seeking federal acknowledgement, consider both Hupa and Chimariko to be their heritage languages, but emphasize Hupa for purposes of cultural revitalization\" (p. 89). There are no programs available to either teach or revitalize Chimariko from its current status of extinct (p. 89).\n\nThe consonant inventory of Chimariko is:\n\nThe vowel inventory of Chimariko is: i, e, a, o, u.\n\nChimariko shares syllabic similarities with other languages in Northern California. The most common syllable structures for Chimariko are CV and CVC, with the largest possible structures being CCVC or CVCC.\n\nNoun incorporation is present in Chimariko. The verbs have prefixes, suffixes and a circumfix.\n\nVerb templates:\n\nBecause the documentary corpus of Chimariko was limited, the description of the grammar of the language was not complete. However, general observations were made.\n\nAmong the recorded grammatical characteristics are the following: Chimariko had reduplication in many nominal forms, particularly in the names of fauna (e.g., \"tsokoko-tci\" \"bluejay\", \"himimitcei\" \"grouse\"). Like many American languages (such as Shasta, Maidu, Wintun, as well as Shoshoni, Siouan, and Pomo), Chimariko verbs had a series of instrumental and body-part prefixes, indicating the particular body part or object with which an action was carried out. Instrumentals are attached at the beginning of the verb root and often occur with a suffix which indicates the motion in the verb, such as \"-ha\" \"up\", \"-hot\" \"down\", and \"-usam\" \"through\".\n\nList of instrumentals from Dixon: \nChimariko does not use numeral classifiers. Also lacking is a clear pattern to indicate control.\n\nPronominal affixes by verb stem class:\nAccording to Carmen Jany, \"no other language has the exact same system as Chimariko\". Chimariko uses both a decimal and quinary numeral systems. Numerals appear in noun phrases, do not take affixes (except for the determinative suffix \"-lle\"), can either follow or precede the noun, and can appear without a noun.\n\nThere are two demonstrative pronouns in Chimariko indicating \"here\" and \"there\". \"Qè-\" indicates here, or near the speaker, and \"pa-\" indicates there, or a distance from the speaker. To indicate \"this\" and \"that\", the intensive suffix \"-ut\" is added: \n\nThere are many directional suffixes:\nThe modal system in Chimariko is abundant. Modal suffixes attach at the very end of a verb after all other suffixes are applied and generally don't occur with aspectual suffixes. The modal suffixes function as interrogatives, negatives, dubitatives, speculatives, conditionals, emphatics, potentials, potential futures, purposive futures, optatives, desideratives, imperatives, admonitives, intensives, inferentials, resultatives, and evidentials.\n\nThe research available indicates a variation in opinion about Chimariko's word order. Dixon claimed that usual word order is SVO or SOV, but in some cases the object precedes the subject, especially when the subject is pronominal. Jany claims that word order is not rigid but is mainly verb-final. The clauses are separated by brackets and the verbs are bolded in the following example:\nInside noun phrases, there is variation in order of modifiers and the noun; sometimes the noun comes before other elements of the phrase, sometimes after. When dealing with possession, the subject always precedes the object.\n\nChimariko has an agent/patient case system. For first persons, agent and patient are differentiated in both transitive and intransitive clauses, and third persons are not. Person hierarchy in the argument structure is present as well where speech act participants are favored over third persons.\n\nChimariko differentiates alienable and inalienable possession. Alienable possessions such as objects and kinship are marked by suffix, while inalienable possessions such as body parts are marked by prefix, on the possessed.\n\nExamples from JP Harrington field notes (Jany 2007) contrasting alienable and inalienable possession:\n\nIn Chimariko, there is no grammatical complementation, however there are a few strategies to convey semantic complementation including separate clauses, verbal affixes, the use of attitude words, and using the desiderative \"imiˀna\" 'to want'.\nExamples from Jany (2007):\n\nIn Chimariko, relativization can be done one of two ways - using a special verb suffix \"-rop/-rot\" to form internally headed clauses, and or by a headless relative clause. There is a relative pronoun \"map'un\" that is sometimes used.\nJP Harrington field note example found in Jany (2007):\n\n\n"}

The emperor commissioned the papal theologians to prepare a response. An initial version of the \"Confutatio\" was rejected by the emperor, as excessively polemic and verbose. In formulating the \"Confutatio\", the lead was taken by Johann Eck. On 3 August 1530, the final version was read at the Diet. The \"Confutatio\" clearly rejected the statements of the Augsburg Confession, and called for a return to the Roman doctrine.\n\nIn other respects, however, the \"Confutatio\" found common ground with the Augsburg Confession. Emperor Charles V refused to hand over the text to the Protestants, unless they agreed not to respond, which they refused. But the Protestants had transcribed it as it was read. Melanchthon responded with the \"Apology of the Augsburg Confession\", completed in 1531, but not presented to the emperor.\n\n"}
{"id": "530256", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=530256", "title": "De dicto and de re", "text": "De dicto and de re\n\nDe dicto and de re are two phrases used to mark a distinction in intensional statements, associated with the intensional operators in many such statements. The distinction is used regularly in metaphysics and in philosophy of language.\n\nThe literal translation of the phrase \"de dicto\" is \"about what is said\", whereas \"de re\" translates as \"about the thing\". The original meaning of the Latin locutions may help to elucidate the living meaning of the phrases, in the distinctions they mark. The distinction can be understood by examples of intensional contexts of which three are considered here: a context of thought, a context of desire, and a context of modality.\n\nThere are two possible interpretations of the sentence \"Peter believes someone is out to get him\". On one interpretation, 'someone' is unspecific and Peter suffers a general paranoia; he believes that it is true that a person is out to get him, but does not necessarily have any beliefs about who this person may be. What Peter believes is that the predicate 'is out to get Peter' is satisfied. This is the \"de dicto\" interpretation.\n\nOn the \"de re\" interpretation, 'someone' is specific, picking out some particular individual. There is some person Peter has in mind, and Peter believes that person is out to get him.\n\nIn the context of thought, the distinction helps us explain how people can hold seemingly self-contradictory beliefs. Say Lois Lane believes Clark Kent is weaker than Superman. Since Clark Kent is Superman, taken \"de re\", Lois's belief is untenable; the names 'Clark Kent' and 'Superman' pick out an individual in the world, and a person (or super-person) cannot be stronger than himself. Understood \"de dicto\", however, this may be a perfectly reasonable belief, since Lois is not aware that Clark and Superman are one and the same.\n\nConsider the sentence \"Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County\". It could be read either \"de dicto\" or \"de re\"; the meanings would be different. One interpretation is that Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County, whoever he might be. On this interpretation, what the statement tells us is that Jana has a certain unspecific desire; what she desires is that a certain situation should obtain, namely, \"Jana's marrying the tallest man in Fulsom County\". The desire is directed at that situation, regardless of how it is to be achieved. The other interpretation is that Jana wants to marry a certain man, who in fact happens to be the tallest man in Fulsom County. Her desire is for \"that man\", and she desires herself to marry \"him\". Again, the first interpretation, \"Jana desires that she marry the tallest man in Fulsom County\", is the \"de dicto\" interpretation. The second interpretation, \"Of the tallest man in Fulsom County, Jana desires that she marry him\", is the \"de re\" interpretation.\n\nAnother way to understand the distinction is to ask what Jana would want if the man who was the tallest man in Fulsom County, at the time the original statement was made, were to lose his accolade to a 9 foot tall immigrant, such that he was no longer the tallest man in Fulsom County. If she continued to want to marry that man – and, importantly, perceived this as representing no change in her desires – then she could be taken to have meant the original statement in a \"de re\" sense. If she no longer wanted to marry that man but instead wanted to marry the \"new\" tallest man in Fulsom County, and saw this as a continuation of her earlier desire, then she meant the original statement in a \"de dicto\" sense.\n\nThe number of discovered chemical elements is 118. Take the sentence \"The number of chemical elements is necessarily greater than 100\". Again, there are two interpretations as per the \"de dicto\"/\"de re\" distinction. According to the \"de dicto\" interpretation, even if the inner workings of the atom could differ, there could not be fewer than 100 elements. The second interpretation, \"de re\", is that things could not have gone differently with the number 118 turning out to be fewer than 100. Intuitively, this claim is true. Of all the ways the world could have turned out, presumably there are no possibilities wherein 118 is fewer than 100. That 118 is greater than 100 is a necessary fact. The \"de dicto\" interpretation seems to yield a false statement. The \"de re\" interpretation seems to yield a true statement.\n\nAnother example: \"The President of the USA in 2001 could not have been Al Gore\". This claim seems false on a \"de dicto\" reading. Presumably, things could have gone differently, with the Supreme Court not claiming that Bush had won the election. But it looks more plausible on a \"de re\" reading. After all, we might skeptically wonder of George W. Bush whether \"he\" could have been Al Gore. Indeed, assuming that \"being George Bush\" is an essential feature of George Bush and that this feature is incompatible with being Al Gore, a \"de re\" reading of the statement is true.\n\nIn modal logic the distinction between \"de dicto\" and \"de re\" is one of scope. In \"de dicto\" claims, any existential quantifiers are within the scope of the modal operator, whereas in \"de re\" claims the modal operator falls within the scope of the existential quantifier. For example:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3362029", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3362029", "title": "Extended projection principle", "text": "Extended projection principle\n\nThe extended projection principle (EPP) is a linguistic hypothesis about subjects. It was proposed by Noam Chomsky as an addendum to the projection principle. The basic idea of the EPP is that clauses must contain a noun phrase or determiner phrase in the subject position (i.e. in the specifier of a tense phrase or inflectional phrase or in the specifier of a verb phrase in languages in which subjects don't raise to TP/IP, e.g. Welsh).\n\nMost verbs require meaningful subjects—for example, \"kick\" in \"Tom kicked the ball\" takes the subject \"Tom\". However, other verbs do not require (and in fact, do not permit) meaningful subjects—for example, one can say \"it rains\" but not \"the sky rains\". The EPP states that regardless of whether the main predicate assigns a meaningful theta role to a subject, a subject must be present syntactically. As a result, verbs which do not assign external theta roles will appear with subjects that are either dummy pronouns (e.g. expletive \"it,\" \"there\"), or ones which have been moved into subject position from a lower position (e.g. subject of an embedded clause which comes after the verbs like \"seem\", \"appear\" etc. ).\n\nExamples which have been proposed to be the result of expletive subject insertion in accordance with the EPP:\n\n\nNotice that in all of these the overt subject has no \"referential\" reading.\n\nIn languages that allow pro-drop (such as Spanish or Italian), the empty category \"pro\" (not to be confused with Big PRO) can fulfill the requirement of the EPP.\n\nMcCloskey (1996) proposed that there is one group of languages that lacks the EPP: the VSO languages (like Irish), which appear not only to lack expletives, but also to lack movement operations triggered by the EPP.\n"}
{"id": "15039439", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15039439", "title": "Extrajudicial killing", "text": "Extrajudicial killing\n\nAn extrajudicial killing (also known as extrajudicial execution) is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process. Extrajudicial punishments are mostly seen by humanity to be unethical, since they bypass the due process of the legal jurisdiction in which they occur. Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures and are only those carried out by the state government or other state authorities like the armed forces or police, as extra-legal fulfillment of their prescribed role.\n\nSection 3(a) of the United States Torture Victim Protection Act contains a definition of extrajudicial killing:\n\nExtrajudicial killings and death squads are common in Syria, Iraq, Egypt, Libya, Central America, India, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Venezuela, Indonesia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, several nations or regions in Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi, Jamaica, Kosovo, Russia, Uzbekistan, parts of Thailand, Turkey, in the Philippines, Tajikistan,El Salvador, Papua New Guinea, and by Israeli forces. One of the most recent issues regarding extrajudicial killing has been the debate about the legal and moral status of targeted killing by unmanned aerial vehicles by the United States.\n\nArgentina's dictatorial government during the 1976–1983 period used extrajudicial killings systematically as way of crushing the opposition in the so-called \"Dirty War\" or what is known in Spanish as \"La Guerra Sucia\". During this violent period, it is estimated that the military regime killed between eleven thousand and fifteen thousand people and most of the victims were known or suspected to be opponents of the regime. These included intellectuals, labor leaders, human rights workers, priests, nuns, reporters, politicians, and artists as well as their relatives. Authorities Half of the number of extra-judicial killings were reportedly carried out by the murder squad that operated from a detention center in Buenos Aires called \"Escuela Mecanica de la Armada\". The dirty wars in Argentina sometimes triggered even more violent conflicts since the killings and crackdowns precipitated responses from insurgents.\n\nBangladeshi special security force Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) has long been known for extrajudicial killing. In a leaked WikiLeaks cable it was found that RAB was trained by the UK government. 16 RAB officials (sacked afterwards) including Lt Col (sacked) Tareque Sayeed, Major (sacked) Arif Hossain, and Lt Commander (sacked) Masud Rana were given death penalty for abduction, murder, concealing the bodies, conspiracy and destroying evidences in the Narayanganj Seven Murder case.\n\nBeside this lots of alleged criminals were killed by Bangladesh police by the name of Crossfire. In 2018, many alleged drug dealers were killed in the name of \"War on Drugs\" in Bangladesh.\n\nIn 1999 Belarusian opposition leaders Yury Zacharanka and Viktar Hanchar together with his business associate Anatol Krasouski disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President Alexander Lukashenko ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on “opposition scum”. Although the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist Dzmitry Zavadski in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated. Human Rights Watch claims that Zacharanka, Hanchar, Krasouski and Zavadski likely became victims of extrajudicial executions.\n\nWhen General Augusto Pinochet assumed power in 1973, he immediately ordered the purges, torture, and deaths of more than 3,000 supporters of the previous government without trial. During his regime, which lasted from 1973 to 1989, elements of the military and police continued committing extrajudicial killings. These included Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's National Intelligence Directorate (DINA), which served as Pinochet's secret police. He was behind numerous assassinations and human rights abuses such as the 1974 abduction and forced disappearance of Socialist Party leader Victor Olea Alegria. Some of the killings were also coordinated with other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the so-called Operation Condor. There were reports of United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement, particularly within its activities in Central and South America that promoted anti-Communist coups. While CIA's complicity was not proven, American dollars supported the regimes that carried out extrajudicial killings such as the Pinochet administration. CIA, for instance, helped create DINA and the agency admitted that Contreras was one of its assets. \n\nDuring the Salvadoran civil war, death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop Óscar Romero for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, four Americans—three nuns and a lay worker—were raped and murdered by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as Rutilio Grande. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the Carter administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the Reagan administration, although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.\n\nHonduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was Battalion 316. Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States Central Intelligence Agency.\n\nIn 1953 a regime was installed through the efforts of the American CIA and the British MI6 in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) Mohammad Reza Pahlavi used SAVAK death squads (also trained by the CIA) to imprison, torture and/or kill hundreds of dissidents. After the 1979 revolution death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran—Ayatollah Khomeini—information on KGB agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.\n\nIraq was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of King Faisal, though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. King Ghazi of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see Anglo-Iraqi War), for fear that the government of Rashid Ali al-Gaylani might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the Axis powers. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from Baghdad made up of Sunni ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.\n\nThe country has since become increasingly partitioned following the Iraq War into three zones: a Kurdish ethnic zone to the north, a Sunni center and the Shia ethnic zone to the south. The secular Arab socialist Baathist leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia (Prime Minister) and Kurdish (President of the Republic) peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish (Peshmerga).\n\nThere were death squads formed by members of every ethnicity. In the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now-Shia police department and army (and militia members posing as members of police or armed forces) formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long-tolerated death squads. They possibly had links to the Interior Ministry and were popularly known as the 'black crows'. These groups operated night or day. They usually arrested people, then either tortured or killed them.\n\nThe victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni insurgency. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed. Some of these killings have also been part of simple robberies or other criminal activities.\n\nA feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the \"New York Times\" claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the \"Wolf Brigade\", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in El Salvador.\n\nWestern news organizations such as \"Time\" and \"People\" disassembled this by focusing on aspects such as probable militia membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the United States-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.\n\nA form of extrajudicial killing called police encounters is common in India. Such encounters are being staged also by military and security forces.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has called the massacre the single deadliest event for journalists in history. Even prior to this, the CPJ had labeled the Philippines the second most dangerous country for journalists, second only to Iraq.\n\nFollowing the election of President Rodrigo Duterte in 2016, a campaign against illegal drugs has led to widespread extrajudicial killings. This follows the actions by then-Mayor Duterte to roam Davao in order to \"encounter to kill\".\n\nThe Philippine president has urged its citizens to kill suspected criminals and drug addicts, ordered the police to adopt a shoot-to-kill policy has offered bounties for dead suspects, and has even admitted to personally killing suspected criminals.\n\nThe move has sparked widespread condemnation from international publications and magazines, prompting the Philippine government to issue statements denying the existence of state-sanctioned killings.\n\nThough Duterte’s controversial war on drugs was opposed by the United States under President Barack Obama, the European Union, and the United Nations, Duterte claims that he has received approving remarks from US President Donald Trump.\n\nOn a news report of ABS-CBN dated September 26, 4:17 PM, Duterte issued guidelines that would enable the United Nations Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Killings to probe the rising death toll. On a news report of GMA News dated December 14, 10:24 PM, Duterte cancelled the planned visit of the Rapporteur for failure of the latter to accept the conditions for the probe.\n\nIn Soviet Russia since 1918 Cheka was authorized to execute \"counterevolutionaries\" without trial. Hostages were also executed by Cheka during the Red Terror in 1918–1920.\n\nThe successors of Cheka also had the authority for extrajudicial executions. In 1937–38 hundreds of thousands where executed extrajudicially during the Great Purge under the lists approved by NKVD troikas. In some cases the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, Solomon Mikhoels was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident. The Soviet special services also conducted extrajudicial killings abroad, most notably of Leon Trotskiy in 1940 in Mexico, Stepan Bandera in 1959 in Germany, Georgi Markov in 1978 in London.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, a number of journalist murders were attributed to public administration figures, usually where the publications would reveal their involvement in large corruption scandals.\n\nIt has been regarded that the Alexander Litvinenko murder was linked to Russian special forces.\n\nUSA and UK intelligence agents reportedly claim that Russian assassins, some possibly at orders of the government, are behind at least fourteen targeted killings on British soil that police called non-suspicious.\n\nIn a report, Amnesty International documented incidents that \"appear to have been extrajudicial executions\" against Palestinian civilians. Those incidents occurred after Palestinians attempted to attack, and murder, Israelis, but even though the attackers did not pose a serious threat due to soldiers' armor, they were shot without ensuring that the threat was real and without attempt to arrest suspects before resorting to the use of lethal force.\n\nReportedly thousands of extrajudicial killings occurred during the 2003 anti-drug effort of Thailand's prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.\n\nRumors still persist that there is collusion between the government, rogue military officers, the radical right wing, and anti-drug death squads.\n\nBoth Muslim and Buddhist sectarian death squads still operate in the south of the country.\n\nIn 1990 Amnesty International published its first report on extrajudicial executions in Turkey. In the following years the problem became more serious. The Human Rights Foundation of Turkey determined the following figures on extrajudicial executions in Turkey for the years 1991 to 2001:\nIn 2001 the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Ms. Asma Jahangir,\npresented a report on a visit to Turkey. The report presented details of killings of prisoners (26 September 1999, 10 prisoners killed in a prison in Ankara; 19 December 2000, an operation in 20 prisons launched throughout Turkey resulted in the death of 30 inmates and two gendarmes).\n\nFor the years 2000–2008 the Human Rights Association (HRA) gives the following figures on doubtful deaths/deaths in\ncustody/extra judicial execution/torture by paid village guards\nIn 2008 the human rights organization Mazlum Der counted 25 extrajudicial killings in Turkey.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, members of the British armed forces, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and British agents, on occasion killed without lawful excuse during The Troubles. Brian Nelson, an Ulster Defence Association member and British Army agent was convicted of sectarian murders.\n\nThe legality of killings such as in the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011 have been brought into question. In that case, the US defended itself claiming the killing was not an assassination but an act of \"National Self Defense\".\nThere had been just under 2,500 assassinations by targeted drone strike by 2015, and these too have questioned as being extrajudicial killings.\nConcerns about targeted and sanctioned killings of non-Americans and American citizens in overseas counter-terrorism activities have been raised by lawyers, news firms and private citizens. On September 30, 2011 a drone strike in Yemen killed American citizens Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan. Both individuals resided in Yemen at the time of their deaths. The executive order approving Al-Awlaki's death was issued by Barack Obama in 2010, was and challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights in that year. The U.S. president issued an order, approved by the National Security Council, that Al-Awlaki's normal legal rights as a civilian should be suspended and his death should be imposed, as he was a threat to the United States. The reasons provided to the public for approval of the order were Al-Awlaki's links to the 2009 Fort Hood Massacre and the 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot, the attempted destruction of a Detroit-bound passenger-plane. The following month, al-Awlaki's son was killed by mistake by another US drone strike.\n\nNguyễn Văn Lém (referred to as Captain Bay Lop) (died 1 February 1968 in Saigon) was a member of the Viet Cong who was summarily shot in Saigon during the Tet Offensive. The photograph of his death would become one of many anti-Vietnam War icons in the Western World.\n\nMany human rights organizations including Amnesty International along with the United Nations are campaigning against extrajudicial punishment.\n\n\n"}

It is part of Norton's \"Forerunner\" universe.\n\n\"Galactic Derelict\" continues the series’ premise, an encounter between Western heroes and a mysterious alien race that has used time travel to alter Earth. This novel shifts between present day and the time of Folsom Man, some 10,000 years ago.\n\n\"Kirkus Reviews\" comments for this novel “Andre Norton has no peer in his [​sic​] chosen field of science fiction for teenagers ... [here] there’s a hint of racial antagonism.” (The novel has pointed comments about racism against American Indians.)\n\nIn the 2000 republished version Norton changed the word Reds to Russians. No change was made in the story.\n\nWhile seeking water for his cattle Travis Fox enters a little known canyon in the Arizona desert and gets captured by three men, one of whom he recognizes as Dr. Gordon Ashe, an archaeologist. After discovering that Fox studied archaeology and had done some digging in the very canyon they now occupy, the men have him cleared through security and offer to make him part of their team. Then Ashe tells him that he will be joining an expedition 10,000 years into the past to look for a spaceship.\n\nDisguised as Folsom hunters, Fox, Ashe, and Ross Murdock travel into the past to scout out the area around the wreckage of an alien starship, a sphere perhaps 120 feet in diameter. They find the wreck near a lake and then, across a ridge, they find a smaller spaceship intact, its crew of Baldies dead. After receiving the scouts’ report via transtemporal telegraph, Major Kelgarries, the project’s director, and several technicians come into the past and examine the small ship, determining that they can shift it directly into the present.\n\nFox, Ashe, and Murdock serve as roving sentries in the area around the smaller globeship as technicians build a time transfer cage around it. The ash from a volcanic explosion and a stampede of mammoths drive the three men into the ship with Case Renfry, an electronics technician, on the day the transfer is to be made. An earthquake triggers the transfer, bringing the ship into the present, and then the ship’s preset autopilot, jolted into action, takes the ship into space.\n\nAfter carrying the men through hyperspace, the ship lands on a planet where faltering robots refuel the ship. Another leap through hyperspace brings the ship to the second planet of an alien solar system. The ship lands in a desert, sits for a couple of days, and then blasts off on a course that takes it to the system’s Earth-like third planet. Upon landing the ship indicates that the voyage has ended by ejecting a small discus from its autopilot.\n\nRenfry attempts to understand the autopilot and to rewind the course “tape” while the three time agents explore the jungle-draped ruins of a once-great city, in which they have landed. After several weeks Renfry believes that he has succeeded and he attempts to launch the ship. The ship runs its course in reverse, pausing on the desert planet and the refueling station, and brings the four men back to Earth, landing on the very spot from which they had blasted off.\n\nUnaware that Norton was a woman, the reviewer at \"Kirkus Review\" (1 October1959 issue) wrote: \nFloyd C. Gale of \"Galaxy Science Fiction\" rated the novel five stars out of five for children, stating that it had \"All the classic elements that make a good juvenile – or a good adult book, for that matter – are present in full measure in \"Galactic Derelict\"\". He concluded that it was \"a top-notch science-adventure yarn\".\n\n\nProject Gutenberg has two free novels from this series:\n\n"}
{"id": "368421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=368421", "title": "Garden-path sentence", "text": "Garden-path sentence\n\nA garden-path sentence is a grammatically correct sentence that starts in such a way that a reader's most likely interpretation will be incorrect; the reader is lured into a parse that turns out to be a dead end or yields a clearly unintended meaning. \"Garden path\" refers to the saying \"to be led down [or up] the garden path\", meaning to be deceived, tricked, or seduced.\n\nSuch a sentence leads the reader toward a seemingly familiar meaning that is actually not the one intended. It is a special type of sentence that creates a momentarily ambiguous interpretation because it contains a word or phrase that can be interpreted in multiple ways, causing the reader to begin to believe that a phrase will mean one thing when in reality it means something else. When read, the sentence seems ungrammatical, makes almost no sense, and often requires rereading so that its meaning may be fully understood after careful parsing.\n\n\nWhen reading a sentence, readers will analyze the words and phrases they see and make inferences about the sentence’s grammatical structure and meaning in a process called parsing. Generally, readers will parse the sentence chunks at a time and will try to interpret the meaning of the sentence at each interval. As readers are given more information they make an assumption of the contents and meaning of the whole sentence. With each new portion of the sentence encountered, they will try to make that part make sense with the sentence structures that they have already interpreted and their assumption about the rest of the sentence. The garden-path sentence effect occurs when the sentence has a phrase or word with an ambiguous meaning that the reader interprets in a certain way, and when they read the whole sentence there is a difference in what has been read and what was expected. The reader must then read and evaluate the sentence again to understand its meaning. The sentence may be parsed and interpreted in different ways due to the influence of pragmatics, semantics, or other factors describing the extralinguistic context.\n\nVarious strategies can be used when parsing a sentence, and there is much debate over which parsing strategy humans use. Differences in parsing strategies can be seen from the effects of a reader attempting to parse a part of a sentence that is ambiguous in its syntax or meaning. For this reason, garden-path sentences are often studied as a way to test which strategy humans use. Two debated parsing strategies that humans are thought to use are serial and parallel parsing.\n\nSerial parsing means that the reader makes one interpretation of the ambiguity, and continues to parse the sentence in the context of that interpretation. The reader will continue to use the initial interpretation as reference for future parsing until disambiguating information is given.\n\nParallel parsing means that the reader generates multiple interpretations of the sentence and stores them until disambiguating information is given, at which point only the correct interpretation is maintained.\n\nWhen ambiguous nouns appear, they can function as both the object of the first item or the subject of the second item. In that case the former use is preferred. It is also found that the reanalysis of a garden-path sentence gets more and more difficult with the length of the ambiguous phrase.\n\nA research paper published by Meseguer, Carreiras and Clifton (2002) stated that intensive eye movements are observed when people are recovering from a mild garden-path sentence. They proposed that people use two strategies, both of which are consistent with the selective reanalysis process described by Frazier and Rayner in 1982. According to them, the readers predominantly use two alternative strategies to recover from mild garden-path sentences. \n\nPartial reanalysis occurs when analysis is not complete. Frequently, when people can make even a little bit of sense of the later sentence, they stop analyzing further so the former part of the sentence still remains in memory and does not get discarded from it.\n\nTherefore, the original misinterpretation of the sentence remains even after the reanalysis is done; hence participants' final interpretations are often incorrect.\n\nOne way to determine the brain processes involved is the use of brain electrophysiology. Brain electrophysiology is used to study the impact of disfluencies in sentence processing by the brain, which specifically use event-related potentials (ERPs). ERPs are voltages generated by the brain that can be measured through a device placed on the scalp. It is also observed that specific components of the ERPs can be associated with the activation of different and specific linguistic processes of the brain. \nWithin ERPs, P600 is the most important component. Its activation occurs when the parser comes across a syntactic violation such as \"The broker persuaded to sell the stock\" or when the parser synthesizes an unsatisfactory disambiguation on an ambiguous string of words such as \"The doctor charged the patient was lying\". Hence the activation of P600 marks the parser's attempt to revise the sentence's structural mis-match or ambiguity. However it is also observed that the activation of P600 may be low or completely absent if the parser is asked to pay attention only to the semantic aspects of a sentence either through an explicit instruction or through the use of specific words as a way to force a semantic analysis of the sentence. The result of yet another study conducted by Osterhout in 1997 reveal that the activation of P600 varies with the parser's own attentions to the syntactic violations of the sentence.\n\nDisfluent sentences have a direct effect on the way a sentence structure is built in the parser's mind. Depending on its location within a sentence, a disfluency either aids in the computation of a sentence or forces the parser to linger on the sentence for a longer period of time. It is observed that the more an individual lingers on an incorrect parse, the more it is likely that the sentence will end up being interpreted incorrectly. It also appears that the presence of a disfluency in a sentence—caused by filled and long silent parses—does not elicit the P600. Instead, it elicits another ERP component, N400, which gets activated when people try to integrate a new word into the preceding sentence's context.\n\n\n\n"}

It was launched in 2005 by editor-in-chief Mirela Roznovschi, then NYU Law School's Foreign and International Law Reference Librarian, with the support of professor Joseph H. H. Weiler and dean Richard Revesz. Roznovschi conceived of the project while in Armenia as a guest instructor in legal research, and in 2003 after her return to NYU, she discussed the idea with Weiler, who came up with the name.\n\nGlobaLex publishes articles both on topical areas, such as treaty research (particularly \"travaux préparatoires\"), regional trade agreements in Africa, or the TRIPS Agreement, as well as guides to the laws of specific jurisdictions. By 2007, GlobaLex had coverage of more than 80 jurisdictions. By 2012, that had expanded to a total of 195 research guides, including 144 guides for specific jurisdictions, 15 comparative law guides, and 32 international law guides. As editor-in-chief, Roznovschi was responsible for finding authors who are experts in their topic areas to write guides to specific jurisdictions or topic areas, and to supervise the process of writing the article. Some authors write a guide in a foreign language and have it translated into English, with the whole process often taking as long as a year. GlobaLex pays a small honorarium to authors to offset basic expenses. In 2017, Lucie Olejnikova replaced Roznovschi as editor-in-chief following the retirement of the latter.\n\nBecause of GlobaLex's breadth, law librarians frequently recommend it as a valuable resource for legal research. Some commenters in 2007 noted that the depth of coverage varied greatly by jurisdiction and that greater standardization would be helpful. A 2016 review evaluated GlobaLex favorably under information search process criteria, though criticized it for its lack of current awareness tools. Roznovschi was the recipient of the American Association of Law Libraries' Reynolds & Flores Award in 2015 for her work on GlobaLex.\n\n"}

Hell Drivers provided audiences with a show filled with precision driving and deliberate crashes. \n\nFeatured stunts included driving cars on two wheels, crashing through flaming barricades, and jumping an automobile ramp to ramp through mid air. For many years, Hell Drivers were used to demonstrate the dependability of a manufacturer's automotive product. Major Hell Driver automotive sponsors have included Chevrolet, Dodge, Chrysler, Ford, AMC, Nash, and Toyota.\n\nLater thrill shows coining the phrase \"Hell Drivers\" were launched by such drivers and race promoters as Jack Kochman, John Francis \"Irish\" Horan, Danny Fleenor, Geoff Williams and Joie Chitwood. Chitwood bought Teter's Hell Drivers from Teter's widow after Teter was killed in a jump in 1943.

{"id": "2270693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2270693", "title": "Holger Pedersen (linguist)", "text": "Holger Pedersen (linguist)\n\nHolger Pedersen (; 7 April 1867 – 25 October 1953) was a Danish linguist who made significant contributions to language science and wrote about 30 authoritative works concerning several languages.\n\nHe was born in Gelballe, Denmark, and died in Hellerup, next to Copenhagen.\n\n\"(Principal source: Koerner 1983)\"\n\nPedersen studied at the University of Copenhagen with Karl Verner, Vilhelm Thomsen, and Hermann Möller. He subsequently studied at the University of Leipzig with Karl Brugmann, Eduard Sievers, Ernst Windisch, and August Leskien.\n\nIn the fall of 1893, Pedersen enrolled at the University of Berlin, where he studied with Johannes Schmidt. The following year he studied Celtic languages and Sanskrit with Heinrich Zimmer at the University of Greifswald.\n\nIn 1895 he spent several months in the Aran Islands in Ireland to study the conservative form of Gaelic spoken there.\n\nPedersen submitted his doctoral dissertation to the University of Copenhagen in 1896. It dealt with aspiration in Irish. It was accepted and published in 1897. The dissertation committee included Vilhelm Thomsen and Otto Jespersen.\n\nAlso in 1897, Pedersen took a position as a lecturer on Celtic languages at the University of Copenhagen. In 1900 he became a reader in comparative grammar there. In 1902 he was offered a professorship at the University of Basel, which he declined, but was able at the same time to persuade the University of Copenhagen to establish an extraordinary professorship for him (Koerner 1983:xii). Pedersen also turned down the offer in 1908 of a professorship at the University of Strassburg (ib.). Following the retirement of Vilhelm Thomsen in 1912, Pedersen acceded to Thomsen's chair at the University of Copenhagen. He remained at the University of Copenhagen for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 1893, Pedersen traveled to Corfu with Karl Brugmann to study Albanian in place. Subsequently, Pedersen published a volume of Albanian texts collected on this journey (1895). The publication was due to the recommendation of Brugmann and Leskien (Koerner 1983:x). He continued to publish work on Albanian for many years thereafter. Pedersen's work on Albanian is often cited in Vladimir Orel's \"Albanian Etymological Dictionary\" (1995).\n\nAmong students of the Celtic languages Pedersen is best known for his \"Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen\", 'Comparative Grammar of the Celtic Languages', which is still regarded as the principal reference work in Celtic historical linguistics.\n\nHis \"Hittitisch und die anderen indoeuropäischen Sprachen\", 'Hittite and the Other Indo-European Languages', represented a significant step forward in Hittite studies, and is often relied on in Friedrich's \"Hethitisches Elementarbuch\" (2d ed. 1960), the standard handbook of Hittite.\n\nAlso influential was his \"Tocharisch vom Gesichtspunkt der indoeuropäischen Sprachvergleichung\", 'Tocharian from the Viewpoint of Indo-European Language Comparison'. For example, André Martinet (2005:179n) states that his discussion of sound changes in Tocharian is \"\"fondé sur la présentation du tokharien par Holger Pedersen\",\" 'based on the presentation of Tocharian by Holger Pedersen'.\n\nIt was Pedersen who formulated the ruki law, an important sound change in Indo-Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic.\n\nHe is also known for the description of Pedersen's Law, a type of accentual shift occurring in Baltic and Slavic languages (1933a).\n\nPedersen endorsed the laryngeal theory (1893:292) at a time when it \"was regarded as an eccentric fancy of outsiders\" (Szemerényi 1996:123). In his classic exposition of the theory, Émile Benveniste (1935:148) credits Pedersen as one of those who contributed most to its development, along with Ferdinand de Saussure, Hermann Möller, and Albert Cuny.\n\nTwo of Pedersen's theories have been receiving considerable attention in recent times after decades of neglect, often known today under the names of the glottalic theory and the Nostratic theory.\n\nIn a work published in 1951, Pedersen pointed out that the frequency of \"b\" in Indo-European is abnormally low. Comparison of languages, however, shows that it would be normal if it had once been the equivalent voiceless stop \"p\", which is infrequent or absent in many languages.\n\nHe also posited that the Indo-European voiced aspirates, \"bh dh gh\", could be better understood as voiceless aspirates, \"ph th kh\".\n\nPedersen therefore proposed that the three stop series of Indo-European, \"p t k\", \"bh dh gh\", and \"b d g\", had at an earlier time been \"b d g\", \"ph th kh\", and \"(p) t k\", with the voiceless and voiced non-aspirates reversed.\n\nThis theory attracted relatively little attention until the American linguist Paul Hopper (1973) and the two Soviet scholars Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze and Vyacheslav V. Ivanov proposed, in a series of articles culminating in a major work by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov published in 1984 (English translation 1995), that the Indo-European \"b d g\" series had originally been a glottalized series, \"p' t' k'.\" Under this form, the theory has attracted wide interest. There seems to be a good chance that it will endure in one form or another.\n\nPedersen seems to have first used the term \"Nostratic\" in an article on Turkish phonology published in 1903. The kernel of Pedersen's argument for Nostratic in that article was as follows (1903:560-561; \"Indo-Germanic\" = Indo-European):\n\nPedersen’s last sentence should be understood as referring to the article he was writing, not the rest of his career. Although he defined the Nostratic family, he himself never produced the work of synthesis the concept seemed to call for. That would await the work of the Russian scholars Illich-Svitych and Dolgopolsky in the 1960s for its first iteration. Nevertheless, Pedersen did not abandon the subject. He produced a substantial (if overlooked) article on Indo-European and Semitic in 1908. He produced a detailed argument in favor of the kinship of Indo-European and Uralic in 1933. In effect, the three pillars of the Nostratic hypothesis are Indo-Uralic, Ural–Altaic, and Indo-Semitic. Pedersen produced works on two of these three, so the impression is incorrect that he neglected this subject in his subsequent career. His interest in the Nostratic idea remained constant amid his many other activities as a linguist.\n\nEnglish \"Nostratic\" is the normal equivalent of German \"nostratisch\", the form used by Pedersen in 1903, and Danish \"nostratisk\" (compare French \"nostratique\"). His 1931 American translator rendered \"nostratisk\" by \"Nostratian,\" but this form did not catch on.\n\nIn his 1931 book, Pedersen defined Nostratic as follows (1931:338):\n\nIn his view, Indo-European was most clearly related to Uralic, with \"similar, though fainter, resemblances\" to Turkish, Mongolian, and Manchu; to Yukaghir; and to Eskimo (1931:338). He also considered Indo-European might be related to Semitic and that, if so, it must be related to Hamitic and possibly to Basque (ib.).\n\nIn modern terms, we would say he was positing genetic relationship between Indo-European and the Uralic, Altaic, Yukaghir, Eskimo, and Afro-Asiatic language families. (The existence of the Altaic family is controversial, and few would now assign Basque to Afro-Asiatic.)\n\nHowever, in Pedersen's view the languages listed did not exhaust the possibilities for Nostratic (ib.):\n\n1893. \"Das Präsensinfix \"n\",\" in \"Indogermanische Forschungen\" 2, 285-332.\n\n1895. \"Albanische Texte mit Glossar.\" Leipzig: S.

{"id": "2015980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2015980", "title": "Indian logic", "text": "Indian logic\n\nThe development of Indian logic dates back to the \"anviksiki\" of Medhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BCE) the Sanskrit grammar rules of Pāṇini (c. 5th century BCE); the Vaisheshika school's analysis of atomism (c. 6th century BCE to 2nd century BCE); the analysis of inference by Gotama (c. 6th century BC to 2nd century CE), founder of the Nyaya school of Hindu philosophy; and the tetralemma of Nagarjuna (c. 2nd century CE). Indian logic stands as one of the three original traditions of logic, alongside the Greek and the Chinese logic. The Indian tradition continued to develop through to early modern times, in the form of the Navya-Nyāya school of logic.\n\nThe Nasadiya Sukta of the \"Rigveda\" (RV 10.129) contains ontological speculation in terms of various logical divisions that were later recast formally as the four circles of \"catuskoti\": \"A\", \"not A\", \"A and 'not A'\", and \"not A and not not A\".\n\nMedhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BCE) founded the \"anviksiki\" school of logic. The \"Mahabharata\" (12.173.45), around the 4th century BCE to 4th century CE, refers to the \"anviksiki\" and \"tarka\" schools of logic. (c. 5th century BCE) developed a form of logic (to which Boolean logic has some similarities) for his formulation of Sanskrit grammar. Logic is described by Chanakya (c. 350-283 BCE) in his \"Arthashastra\" as an independent field of inquiry \"anviksiki\".\n\nVaisheshika, also Vaisesika, (Sanskrit: वैशेषिक) is one of the six Hindu schools of Indian philosophy. It came to be closely associated with the Hindu school of logic, Nyaya. Vaisheshika espouses a form of atomism and postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to a finite number of atoms. Originally proposed by Kanāda (or Kana-bhuk, literally, atom-eater) from around the 2nd century BCE.\n\nIn the 2nd century, the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna refined the \"Catuskoti\" form of logic. The Catuskoti is also often glossed \"Tetralemma\" (Greek) which is the name for a largely comparable, but not equatable, 'four corner argument' within the tradition of Classical logic.\n\n\"Nyāya\" (\"ni-āyá\", literally \"recursion\", used in the sense of \"syllogism, inference\") is the name given to one of the six orthodox or \"astika\" schools of Hindu philosophy — specifically the school of logic.\n\nThe Nyaya school of philosophical speculation is based on texts known as the \"Nyaya Sutras\", which were written by Gotama in around the 2nd century CE. The most important contribution made by the Nyaya school to modern Hindu thought is its methodology. This methodology is based on a system of logic that has subsequently been adopted by most of the other Indian schools (orthodox or not), much in the same way that Western philosophy can be said to be largely based on Aristotelian logic.\n\nFollowers of Nyaya believed that obtaining valid knowledge was the only way to obtain release from suffering. They therefore took great pains to identify valid sources of knowledge and to distinguish these from mere false opinions. According to the Nyaya school, there are exactly four sources of knowledge (pramanas): perception, inference, comparison and testimony. Knowledge obtained through each of these can, of course, still be either valid or invalid. As a result, Nyaya scholars again went to great pains to identify, in each case, what it took to make knowledge valid, in the process creating a number of explanatory schemes. In this sense, Nyaya is probably the closest Indian equivalent to contemporary analytic philosophy.\n\nJainism made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of logic by also occupying itself with the basic epistemological issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable. Jain logic developed and flourished from 6th century BCE to 17th century CE. According to Jains, the ultimate principle should always be logical and no principle can be devoid of logic or reason. Thus one finds in the , deliberative exhortations on any subject in all its facts, may they be constructive or obstructive, inferential or analytical, enlightening or destructive. In the process, the Jains came out with their doctrines of relativity used for logic and reasoning:\n\nThese Jain philosophical concepts made most important contributions to the ancient Indian philosophy, especially in the areas of skepticism and relativity.\n\nFollowing is the list of Jain philosophers who contributed to Jain Logic:\n\nIndian Buddhist logic (called Pramana) flourished from about 500 CE up to 1300 CE. The three main authors of Buddhist logic are Vasubandhu (400–800 CE), Dignāga (480–540 CE), and Dharmakīrti (600–660 CE). The most important theoretical achievements are the doctrine of Trairūpya (Skrt. त्रैरूप्य) and the highly formal scheme of the Hetucakra (Skrt. हेतुचक्र) (\"Wheel of Reasons\") given by Dignāga. There is a still living tradition of Buddhist logic in the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, where logic is an important part of the education of monks.\n\nThe Navya-Nyāya or Neo-Logical darśana (school) of Indian philosophy was founded in the 13th century CE by the philosopher Gangesha Upadhyaya of Mithila. It was a development of the classical Nyāya darśana. Other influences on Navya-Nyāya were the work of earlier philosophers Vācaspati Miśra (900–980 CE) and Udayana (late 10th century).\n\nGangeśa's book Tattvacintāmaṇi (\"Thought-Jewel of Reality\") was written partly in response to Śrīharśa's Khandanakhandakhādya, a defence of Advaita Vedānta, which had offered a set of thorough criticisms of Nyāya theories of thought and language. In his book, Gangeśa both addressed some of those criticisms and – more importantly – critically examined the Nyāya darśana himself. He held that, while Śrīharśa had failed successfully to challenge the Nyāya realist ontology, his and Gangeśa's own criticisms brought out a need to improve and refine the logical and linguistic tools of Nyāya thought, to make them more rigorous and precise.\n\nTattvacintāmani dealt with all the important aspects of Indian philosophy, logic, set theory, and especially epistemology, which Gangeśa examined rigorously, developing and improving the Nyāya scheme, and offering examples. The results, especially his analysis of cognition, were taken up and used by other darśanas.\n\nNavya-Nyāya developed a sophisticated language and conceptual scheme that allowed it to raise, analyse, and solve problems in logic and epistemology. It systematised all the Nyāya concepts into four main categories: sense or perception (pratyakşa), inference (anumāna), comparison or similarity (upamāna), and testimony (sound or word; śabda).\n\nThis later school began around eastern India and Bengal, and developed theories resembling modern logic, such as Gottlob Frege's \"distinction between sense and reference of proper names\" and his \"definition of number,\" as well as the Navya-Nyaya theory of \"restrictive conditions for universals\" anticipating some of the developments in modern set theory. Udayana in particular developed theories on \"restrictive conditions for universals\" and \"infinite regress\" that anticipated aspects of modern set theory. According to Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti:\n\nIn the late 18th-century British scholars began to take an interest in Indian philosophy and discovered the sophistication of the Indian study of inference. This process culminated in Henry T. Colebrooke's \"The Philosophy of the Hindus: On the Nyaya and Vaisesika Systems\" in 1824, which provided an analysis of inference and comparison to the received Aristotelian logic, resulting in the observation that the Aristotelian syllogism could not account for the Indian syllogism. Max Mueller contributed an appendix to the 1853 edition of Thomson's \"Outline of the Laws of Thought\", in which he placed Greek and Indian logic on the same plane: \"The sciences of Logic and Grammar were, as far as history allows us to judge, invented or originally conceived by two nations only, by Hindus and Greeks.\"\n\nJonardon Ganeri has observed that this period saw George Boole (1815-1864) and Augustus De Morgan (1806-1871) make their pioneering applications of algebraic ideas to the formulation of logic (such as algebraic logic and Boolean logic), and has suggested that these figures were likely to be aware of these studies in xeno-logic, and further that their acquired awareness of the shortcomings of propositional logic are likely to have stimulated their willingness to look outside the system.\n\nIndian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and had an influence on pioneering 19th-century logicians such as Charles Babbage (1791-1871), Augustus De Morgan, and particularly George Boole, as confirmed by Boole's wife Mary Everest Boole in an \"open letter to Dr Bose\" titled \"Indian Thought and Western Science in the Nineteenth Century\" written in 1901:\n\nDe Morgan himself wrote in 1860 of the significance of Indian logic: \"The two races which have founded the mathematics, those of the Sanscrit and Greek languages, have been the two which have independently formed systems of logic.\"\n\nMathematicians became aware of the influence of Indian mathematics on the European. For example, Hermann Weyl wrote: \"Occidental mathematics has in past centuries broken away from the Greek view and followed a course which seems to have originated in India and which has been transmitted, with additions, to us by the Arabs; in it the concept of number appears as logically prior to the concepts of geometry. [...] But the present trend in mathematics is clearly in the direction of a return to the Greek standpoint; we now look upon each branch of mathematics as determining its own characteristic domain of quantities.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "710328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=710328", "title": "Jarmo", "text": "Jarmo\n\nAncient Assyria \nJarmo Ancient Assyria (Qal'at Jarmo) is a prehistoric archeological site located in Iraq on the foothills of the Zagros Mountains. It lies at an altitude of 800 m above sea-level in a belt of oak and pistachio woodlands. Excavations revealed that Jarmo was an agricultural community dating back to 7090 BC. It was broadly contemporary with such other important Neolithic sites such as Jericho in the southern Levant and Çatal Hüyük in Anatolia.\n\nThe site was originally discovered by the Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities in 1940, and later became known to archaeologist Robert Braidwood from the University of Chicago Oriental Institute. At the time, he was looking for suitable places to research the origins of the Neolithic Revolution. Braidwood worked as part of the Iraq-Jarmo programme for three seasons, those of 1948, 1950–51 and 1954–55; a fourth campaign, to be carried out in 1958-59 did not come about because of the 14 July Revolution. During the excavations in Jarmo in 1954-55, Braidwood used a multidisciplinary approach for the first time, in an attempt to refine the research methods and clarify the origin of the domestication of plants and animals. Among his team were a geologist, Herbert Wright, a palaeo-botanist, Hans Helbaek, an expert in pottery and radio-carbon dating, Frederic Mason, and a zoologist, Charles Reed, as well as a number of archaeologists. The interdisciplinary method was subsequently used in all serious field work in archaeology.\n\nThe excavations exposed a small village, covering an area of 12,000 to 16,000 m², and which has been dated (by carbon-14) to 7090 BC, for the oldest levels, to 4950 BC for the most recent. The entire site consists of twelve levels. Jarmo appears to be two older, permanent Neolithic settlements and, approximately, contemporary with Jericho or the Neolithic stage of Shanidar. The high point is likely to have been between 6,200 and 5,800 BC. This small village consisted of some twenty five houses, with adobe walls and sun-dried mud roofs, which rested on stone foundations, with a simple floor plan dug from the earth. These dwellings were frequently repaired or rebuilt. In all, about 150 people lived in the village, which was clearly a permanent settlement. In the earlier phases there is a preponderance of objects made from stone, silex- using older styles- and obsidian. The use of this latter material, obtained from the area of Lake Van, 200 miles away, suggests that some form of organized trade already existed, as does the presence of ornamental shells from the Persian Gulf. In the oldest level baskets have been found, waterproofed with pitch, which is readily available in the area.\n\nAgricultural activity is attested by the presence of stone sickles, cutters, bowls and other objects, for harvesting, preparing and storing food, and also by receptacles of engraved marble. In the later phases instruments made of bone, particularly perforating tools, buttons and spoons, have been found. Further research has shown that the villagers of Jarmo grew wheat of two types, emmer and einkorn, a type of primitive barley and lentils (it is common to record the domestication of grains, less so of pulses). Their diet, and that of their animals, also included species of wild plant, peas, acorns, carob seeds, pistachios and wild wheat. Snail shells are also abundant. There is evidence that they had domesticated goats, sheep and dogs. On the higher levels of the site pigs have been found, together with the first evidence of pottery.\n\nJarmo is one of the oldest sites at which pottery has been found, appearing in the most recent levels of excavation, which dates it to the 7th millennium BC. This pottery is handmade, of simple design and with thick sides, and treated with a vegetable solvent. There are clay figures, zoomorphic or anthropomorphic, including figures of pregnant women which are taken to be fertility goddesses, similar to the Mother Goddess of later Neolithic cultures in the same region.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36398168", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36398168", "title": "Jean de Menasce", "text": "Jean de Menasce\n\nJean de Menasce (1902–1973) was a French Catholic priest, of the Dominican Order, as well as an author and academic. He came from Jewish Egyptian and French parentage. Over his lifetime he mastered fifteen languages, including Hebrew, Syriac, and Pahlavi. He was in the Catholic contingent among Jewish and Protestant leaders at an important post-war interfaith conference. Menasce wrote as a theologian, and as a scholar of Middle Eastern studies, especially regarding Judaism, and the Zoroastrian religion.\n\nJean de Menasce was born in Alexandria on 24 December 1902 into a well-established family in the Jewish community of Egypt. His father, \"Baron\" Félix de Menasce, a banker with Austro-Hungarian links, was in fact the head of the Jewish community in Alexandria; he had been raised to the peerage by the Emperor of Austria. Jean's mother was French from a Spanish line. A cousin of Jean de Menasce was the writer and diplomat Georges Cattaui, six years his senior. A second cousin was the composer and pianist Jacques de Menasce.\n\nAfter the local lycée français, Jean de Menasce remained in Cairo studying at its French School of Law. Thereafter he continued his education in Europe, at Oxford University and at the Sorbonne. During the course of his student years, de Menasce had left behind his religious beliefs. \n\nAt Oxford's Balliol College, he was a classmate of the future novelist Graham Greene, who also would convert to Catholicism in 1926. Menasce translated into French works of the English poet T. S. Eliot, a friend. ln 1922 he made the French translation of a book by the philosopher Bertrand Russel, whom he knew as a fellow member of Lady Ottoline Morrell's salon at Oxford. From the poetry of John Donne, the 17th-century Anglican priest, he had also made French versions. Thus he already enjoyed some recognition when in 1926 he became a convert to Catholicism.\n\nIn the meantime, de Menasce had continued to study law and philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris. Then, while pursuing his nurtured interest in Zionism, Haim Weizman, a secular family friend and future President of Israel, appointed him secretary of the Zionist Bureau in Geneva. He then traveled to Jerusalem. \n\nReturning to Paris, de Menasce entered a period of personal spiritual crisis, and painful growth. He began his lifelong friendship with the Catholic philosopher Jacques Maritain and his Jewish wife Raissa, both converts from agnosticism twenty years earlier. Another decisive new friend was Louis Massignon, a scholar whose 4-volume study of the Islamic mystic Al-Hallaj had just been published. Massignon, also a convert, had met de Menasce at the \"La Revue juive\" [The Jewish Review].\n\nIn this learned milieu, in an atmosphere of intense spiritual awareness, de Menasce converted. During his inquiring approach to Christianity with Massignon he had discussed the mystics Theresa of Avila and Francis of Assisi. He had also followed the modern naisance of Jewish-Christian dialogue. After his baptism he spent the first months writing his book on Hassidism, \"Quand Israel aime Dieu\". According to Adrian Hastings:\n\nThe book was \"an exceptionally beautiful study of Jewish Hasidic holiness. It was, in a way, his farewell tribute to the religion of his ancestors, but one feels that he was able to make it only after he had rediscovered the God of Israel through the discovery of Jesus as Messiah.\"\n\nHe then spent two years in Cairo at his father's request. In 1930 he entered the Dominican Order. His formation for the priesthood was conducted in Belgium at de Kain, and he was ordained in 1935.\n\nFollowing an earlier suggestion of Massignon, Fr. Jean de Menasce pursued studies in the Syriac language. It led him into the academic world of religious studies, eventually becoming a professor. \"The relationship of Christianity to Judaism and Islam, and to all the great world religions was central to his missiology.\" Hence his scholarly affinity to the Islamists Massignon, Abd-el Jalil, and Louis Gardet, as well as Hendrik Kraemer. In this context de Menasce approached the theme of Catholic missions after the second world war. \"The relationship of Christianity to Judaism and Islam, and to all the great world religions was central to his missiology.\" \n\nThe priest and professor exerted an important influence within the wide horizons of French Catholic intellectual life. De Menasce was a close friend of the art critic , of the essayist Charles Du Bos, and of the ill-fated writer Maurice Sachs, in addition to the above philosopher Jacques Maritain. Menasce also participated in the neo-Thomist revival within his Church, following Cardinal Charles Journet and Professor Maritain among others.\n\nDe Menasce was continuously involved in fostering Jewish-Christian relations. He played a major role in its evolution during the painful yet persistently hopeful post-war years. During this period, de Menasce lectured on contemporary Jewish thought, e.g., that of philosopher Emmanuel Levinas.\n\nHe was one of nine Catholic participants among the seventy Jewish and Christian leaders at the Seelisberg Conference on the Shoah in 1947. This international religious gathering in Switzerland addressed the world of pain and grief left by the searing ideological conflict. Sponsored by the International Council of Christians and Jews (ICCJ), it faced antisemitism, seeking to heal wounds and to bridge divides, recent and ancient. \n\nIn Iranian studies de Menasce excelled. He became a recognized expert, a leader in the field. In the late 1930s he had studied with Émile Benveniste in Fribourg. During the war he prepared his translation of the Škand-Gumānīk Vičār by Mardan-Farrukk, a ninth century Zoroastrian. The book included transcriptions of the text in Pahlavi and in Pazand, a glossary, and his extensive annotations. He scrutinized the comparative theology of this polemical work, which consciously employs reason to criticize the monotheism of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Each of its chapters is introduced, translated into French, and followed by commentary. The clarity of his language was remarkable. The book was dedicated to his teacher and friend, Professor Benveniste. \n\nIn 1947 the University of Paris invited him to give a series of seminars at the Sorbonne on the Zoroastrian texts, the Denkart. His work here was published in 1958. Menasce was a leader in investigating the epigraphy of the Sasanian Empire. With Henry Corbin and Gilbert Lazard he was a founder of the Association pour l'advancement de études iraniennes. His academic production on Zoroastrian subjects accumulated, including an article on imperial Sasanid law. \n\nDe Menasce illustrated points of convergence between Zoroastrian theological reasoning and the Muslim philosophic school of Mu'tazila, whereby the deity Allah would be understood as divorced from \"all cause\" [\"toute causalité\"] of evil in the world. He probed Augustine's period as a Manichean, a dualist religion derived in part from Zoroastrianism; Augustine later converted to Christianity and became a Church Father. His continued study of the Denkart eventually resulted in further seminars at the Sorbonne in 1962-1964, and the posthumous publication of his work on the Denkart's third book.\n\nThe published works of de Menasce include books and articles on subjects including: theology, philosophy, law, history of religions, Zoroastrianism, and also Judaism, Zionism, and Hassidism. His reputation could rest on his translations alone, made into French from several different languages.\n\nStarting in 1936 he had served as professor at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. In 1939 in Paris he became research professor for the religions of ancient Iran. In 1945 de Menasce participated in founding the journal \"Nouvelle Revue de Science Missionaire/Neue Zeitschrift für Missionswissenschaft\". 1954-1955, he taught at Harvard, and at Princeton, where he renewed his friendship with Jacques Maritain. From 1949 until 1970 he was Director of Studies at l'École pratique des hautes études in Paris; here an academic chair had been created especially for him.\n\nA Muslim colleague said of him, \"[H]e made possible a degree of communication amongst us that would have been much more difficult in his absence.\" After suffering strokes in 1959 and 1969, Father de Menasce died at the age of 70 in 1973.\n\nBooks\n\nArticles\n\nTranslations\n\nBooks\n\n\nArticles\n\nThe initial version of this article was translated in July 2012 from French Wikipedia: .\n"}

{"id": "46427592", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46427592", "title": "List of cults of personality", "text": "List of cults of personality\n\nThis is a list of regimes of countries or individual leaders around the world which have been discussed in the media or academia as having created a cult of personality. A cult of personality uses various techniques, including mass media, propaganda, the arts, patriotism, and government-organized demonstrations and rallies to create an heroic image, of a leader, often inviting worshipful behavior through uncritical flattery and praise.\n\nNur Muhammad Taraki of the ruling communist party served as President of Afghanistan from 1978 to 1979, when he told people to refer to him titles such as the \"Great Leader\". In the 1990s, warlord general Abdul Rashid Dostum, who controlled most of northern Afghanistan, created a somewhat cult of personality in the region.\n\nLong time ruler of communist Albania Enver Hoxha had what the OECD called \"an overwhelming cult of personality and an ultra-centralised, authoritarian form of decision-making\". Hoxha was widely portrayed as a genius who commented on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Statues were erected in cities. Each schoolbook required quotations from him on the subjects being studied. The ruling party of the time, the Party of Labour of Albania, honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher. When Hoxha died in 1985, Ramiz Alia took power. Robert D. McFadden of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Alia's policies of liberalization were \"too little, too late\", and the country descended into violent anarchy. Alia served one year in prison for corruption, but the anarchy prevented further charges from being brought against the former Communist regime.\n\nJuan Domingo Perón, elected three times as President of Argentina, and his second wife, Eva Duarte de Perón, were immensely popular among many of the Argentine people, and to this day they are still considered icons by the leading Justicialist Party. Followers of the Peróns praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and dignify labor, while their detractors considered them demagogues and dictators. To achieve their political goals, the Peronists had to unite around the head of state. As a result, a personality cult developed around both Perón and his wife.\n\nHeydar Aliyev's cult of personality became a significant part of Azerbaijani politics and society after Heydar Aliyev came to power in 1993 and it continued after his death in 2003, when his son Ilham Aliyev succeeded him. Aliyev, a former Soviet politburo member and the leader of Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1987, became the President of Azerbaijan in 1993. He then began to carefully design an autocratic system, with heavy reliance on family and clan members, oil revenues and patronage.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev is presented as the \"Father of the Azeri nation\", often compared to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.\n\nDuring the Vargas Era, the Brazilian Department of Information and Propaganda (DIP) promoted a Messiah-style image of Brazilian dictator Getúlio Vargas by broadcasting propaganda every day and by showing him as \"saviour of the Brazilian people\".\n\nIn recent years there has been a growing cult of personality in modern Brazil around the former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, promoted by the Workers' Party and more recently, around Jair Bolsonaro, promoted by right-wing militants.\n\nA personality cult in the Republic of China was centered on the Kuomintang party founder Sun Yat-sen, and his successor, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The personality cult of Chiang Kai-shek went further after the republican government fled to Taiwan. He was usually referred to as \"Lord Chiang\" (蔣公) in public and a space between the characters of his name and title was required in printed materials. Articles in textbooks and songs glorifying him were commonly seen in Taiwan before 1987.\n\nThe People's Republic of China under Chairman Mao Zedong can also be considered a cult of personality, the most obvious symbol of which is his massive portrait situated on the north end of Tiananmen Square. The culture of the People's Republic of China before 1978 was highly influenced by the personality cult of Mao Zedong which reached its peak during the Cultural Revolution. Mao was referred to as \"the great leader Chairman Mao\" (伟大领袖毛主席) in public and he was entitled \"the great leader, the great supreme commander, the great teacher and the great helmsman\" (伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的导师、伟大的舵手) in Cultural Revolution. Badges and books of his quotations were mass-produced. Most people were required to recite the Quotations of Chairman Mao and printed material at that time usually quoted Mao's words in bold as well as in the preface. The Loyalty dance (忠字舞) was also introduced during the Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1976.\n\nThe cult of personality continued for a short time after Mao's death. His successor, Chairman Hua Guofeng also practiced the cult of personality and he was referred to as \"the brilliant leader Chairman Hua\" (英明领袖华主席). Reforms in 1978 led to a deconstruction of Mao's cult status and the Chinese Communist Party under Deng Xiaoping and his successors such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao were averse to a of personality style of rule lest it recreate the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.\n\nThe rise and consolidation of power under General Secretary Xi Jinping has given way to a return to Mao-style personality cult centered around General Secretary Xi in state media and propaganda messages, with a political theory bearing his name being enshrined into the Communist Party's constitution in the 19th National Congress in October 2017.\n\nFormer president Álvaro Uribe Vélez became the center of a Cult of Personality in Colombia in the later years of the country's armed conflict. Supporters refer to him as \"The Great Colombian\" in spite of his family's ties to the Medellín Cartel and the numerous human rights scandals that marred his presidency. After Uribe failed to amend the constitution that would allow him to stay in power for a third term in 2010, he founded a political party that uses the former president's silhouette as logo. The party's attempts to be named after its \"only leader\" were thwarted in 2012.\n\nAlthough it was reported that one of Fidel Castro's dying wishes was not to have buildings or streets named after him, and that statues of him not be erected, in order to avoid a cult of personality, it is generally believed that such a cult had already developed by the time of his death.\n\nThe Egyptian state practiced a Cult of Personality around Gamal Abdel Nasser during his rule. It has been alleged that the Egyptian media has created a personality cult around the current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.\n\nThe first president of Equatorial Guinea, Francisco Macías Nguema, was the centre of an extreme personality cult, perhaps fueled by his consumption of copious amounts of \"bhang\" and \"iboga\", and he assigned himself titles such as the \"Unique Miracle\" and \"Grand Master of Education, Science, and Culture\". The island of Fernando Pó had its name Africanized after him to Masie Ngueme Biyogo Island; upon his overthrow in 1979, its name was again changed to Bioko. The capital, Santa Isabel, had its name changed to Malabo. In 1978, he changed the national motto of the Coat of arms of Equatorial Guinea to \"There is no other God than Marcias Nguema\".\n\nThis tradition has been continued by Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo who has been accused of building his own personality cult. As evidence of this, in July 2003, the state-operated radio declared that Obiang was \"the country's god\" and that he had \"all power over men and things.\" It added that the president was \"in permanent contact with the Almighty\" and that he \"can decide to kill without anyone calling him to account and without going to hell.\" He personally made similar comments in 1993. Macías had also proclaimed himself a god.\n\nObiang has encouraged his cult of personality by ensuring that public speeches end with well-wishing for himself rather than end with well-wishing for the republic. Many important buildings have a presidential lodge, many towns and cities have streets commemorating Obiang's coup against Macías, and many people wear clothes with his face printed on them.\n\nLike his predecessor and other African dictators such as Idi Amin and Mobutu Sese Seko, Obiang has assigned to himself several creative titles. Among them are \"gentleman of the great island of Bioko, Annobón and Río Muni.\" He also refers to himself as \"El Jefe\" (the boss).\n\nUnder the , a puppet government installed by the Nazis, the leader, Marshal Philippe Petain, was known to have a cult of personality around himself. A song was made just for him called \"Maréchal nous voila!\" (lit. Marshal, Here We Are!) and was mandatory for all school children to learn.\n\nCambodian schoolchildren in French Indochina at one point in the early 1940s began their school-day with prayers to Marshal Philippe Pétain of Vichy France, opening with the words, \"Our father, which art our Leader, glorious be thy name... deliver us from evil.\"\n\nAdolf Hitler, Führer (\"leader\") of Nazi Germany, was referenced by Nazi propaganda in a number of honorary titles (\"Supreme Judge of the German People\", \"First Soldier of the German Reich\", \"First Worker of the New Germany\", \"Greatest Military Commander of All Time\", \"Military Leader of Europe\", \"High Protector of the Holy Mountain\", etc.). Numerous works in popular music and literature featured Adolf Hitler prominently. Hitler was usually depicted as a heroic, god-like figure, loved, feared and respected by the German people.\n\nDictator François Duvalier fostered a personality cult around himself and he claimed that he was the physical embodiment of the nation. He revived the traditions of \"vodou\", later on exploiting them in order to consolidate his power by claiming that he himself was a \"houngan\", or \"vodou\" priest. In an effort to make himself even more imposing, Duvalier deliberately modeled his image on that of Baron Samedi. The most celebrated image from the time shows a standing Jesus Christ with a hand on a seated Papa Doc's shoulder with the caption \"I have chosen him\". In 1986, the Haitian constitution outlawed Duvalier-type personality cults.\n\nMátyás Rákosi was surrounded by a cult of personality similar to that of Stalin. This peaked on his 60th birthday in 1952, which was commemorated with a series of nationwide celebrations. Many things were named after him, including:\nAfter de-Stalinization, his name was dropped from all institutions in 1956.\n\nIndia's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru was known to foster a personality cult around himself. Many leaders opposed Nehru's style of functioning, his economic policies and his socialist agenda. C Rajagopalachari criticized the personality cult surrounding Nehru, saying that there should be an opposition group within the Congress because it was running with \"accelerators and no brakes\" without a true opposition. Rajagopalachari later formed the liberal Swatantra Party because of his opposition to Nehru's style of functioning. The expression 'Nehruvian consensus' reflects the dominance of Nehruvian ideals, this dominance is considered to be a product of Nehru's personality cult and the statism that is associated with it, that is, the overarching faith in the state and the leadership. The Congress party, led by Nehru's kin has been accused of propagating his personality cult.\n\nDuring the Guided Democracy era, there was a personality cult around President Sukarno. He was made president for life by the MPRS in 1963. His ideological writings on Manipol-USDEK and NASAKOM became mandatory subjects in Indonesian schools and universities, while his speeches were to be memorized and discussed by all students. All newspapers, the only radio station (RRI, government-run), and the only television station (TVRI, also government-run) were made into \"tools of the revolution\" and functioned to spread Sukarno's messages. Sukarno developed a personality cult, with the capital of newly acquired West Irian renamed to Sukarnapura and the highest peak in the country was renamed from Carstensz Pyramid to Puntjak Sukarno (Sukarno Peak).\n\nSukarno was popularly referred to as \"bung\" (\"comrade\"), and he painted himself as a man of the people who carried the aspirations of Indonesia and dared to take on the West. Also, some other titles were given to him, like \"Great Leader of the Revolution\". When Suharto became president, Sukarno's cult and roles were erased by the new government in de-Soekarnoization policy.\n\nThe New Order government created some propaganda, in which President Suharto is depicted as the \"main hero\" during the 1949 General Offensive, as well as during the 30 September Movement. He was also granted the title of \"Bapak Pembangunan\" (Father of Development) in 1983. In September 1998, four months after the fall of Suharto, Information Minister Yunus Yosfiah declared that the \"Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI\" film would no longer be compulsory viewing material, reasoning that it was an attempt to manipulate history and create a cult with Suharto as the protagonist.\n\nFollowing the Iranian Revolution, a cult of personality developed around Supreme Leaders Ruhollah Khomeini and Ali Khamenei. This is most evident in the ubiquitous visual depictions of both men. According to Baqer Moin, as part of Khomeini's personality cult, he \"had been transformed into a semi-divine figure. He was no longer a grand ayatollah and deputy of the Imam, one who represents the Hidden Imam, but simply 'The Imam'.\" Khomeini's personality cult fills a central position in foreign- and domestically-targeted Iranian publications. The methods used to create his personality cult have been compared to those used by such figures as Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro, and it was encouraged by Khomeini himself (which was negatively noted by his enemies inside Iran). Regarding Khamenei, Amir Taheri has written, \"Like Khomeini before him, Khamenehi is the object of a massive cult of personality. Official flatterers describe him as a \"Divine Gift to Mankind\" or as the \"Shining Sun of the Imamate.\" In official discourse, he is quoted more often than either Prophet Muhammad or the Koran itself. Objects which he has touched during provincial visits are collected and sold as icons...\"\n\nAs a sign of his consolidation of power as Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein's personality cult pervaded Iraqi society. He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools and classrooms, airports, and shops, as well as on all denominations of Iraqi currency (the dinar). Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the Bedouin, the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even appeared in Kurdish clothing, but he also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout Muslim, wearing a full headdress and robe, praying towards Mecca, but most often he was depicted wearing a military uniform.\n\nAn international airport, a university, a bridge, a dam, a stadium, an art centre, a street, an urban district (Saddam-city), a rocket and other objects were named after him. Saddam even had many well-decorated (by golden flush toilets) palaces for his own private use. People brought many gifts to Saddam that were collected in a special palace. According to his order, every tenth brick of reconstructed ancient buildings (including Nebuchadnezzar's palace) was marked with his name or signature. His biography and his literary works were required reading in schools and Ba'ath party functioneers examined students' knowledge of them. Many written songs, novels, scientific and propaganda articles were devoted to him. State TV was broadcast with his image in the background and a mosque at the corner of the screen and it very often showed him, or his hands being kissed by children and other people.\n\nAfter the fall of his regime, made visible by the toppling of his statue on Firdous Square in Baghdad on April 9, 2003, all statues of Saddam were destroyed. All other aspects of his cult were dissolved as well.\n\nThe cult of Il Duce of fascist Italy Benito Mussolini was in many respects the unifying force of the fascist regime, acting as a common denominator for various political groups and social classes in both the fascist party and the wider Italian society. A basic slogan proclaimed that Mussolini was always right (). Endless publicity revolved around him. He was generally portrayed in a \"macho\" manner, although he could also appear as a Renaissance man, a military man, a family man, or even as a common man. This reflected his presentation as a universal man, expert in all subjects; a light was left on his office long after he was asleep as a part of fascist propaganda in order to present him as an insomniac owing to his driven to work nature. Mussolini himself oversaw which photographs could appear, rejecting some, for instance, because he was not sufficiently prominent in a group. Legends of Mussolini defying death during the First World War and surviving assassination attempts were circulated in order to give the dictator a mythical, immortal aura. In addition to depicting Mussolini as being chosen by God, the regime presented him as having omnipotent, godlike or superhuman powers. His image proclaimed that he had improved the Italian people morally, materially, and spiritually. Even before his seizure of power, he was proclaimed the Duce in song. The war on Ethiopia was presented as a revival of the Roman Empire, with Mussolini as Augustus.\n\nWith the entry of media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi into Italian politics in the 2000s, some critics claimed that a new kind of cult of personality was in place, favored by Berlusconi's three national television networks and newspapers. Moreover, the hymn of Berlusconi's movements Forza Italia and People of Freedom was \"Meno male che Silvio c'è\", literally \"Thank goodness for Silvio\". In addition to that, Berlusconi often described himself as the Jesus Christ of Italian politics. These attitudes were seen by public opinion as clear examples of the new political style that Berlusconi brought into Italy, focused on the leader's charisma, cult of personality and media domination. Silvio Berlusconi was Prime Minister of Italy for three terms and four governments. He governed the country for a total of almost ten years (less than one year in 1994–1995; five years in 2001–2006; and three and a half years in 2008–2011).\n\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev is the subject of a state sponsored personality cult in Kazakhstan, where he has assumed the title \"Leader of the Nation\".\n\nA cult of personality is centered around the founders of the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Kaysone Phomvihane and the less prominent Prince Souphanouvong since their deaths in the early 1990s as there were no personality cults bestowed to them during their time in power. Kaysone's portrait is displayed on public government buildings as well as on Laotian Kip bills. There is a museum built in Vientiane in order to honor Kaysone's life. Statues are also erected in his honor. Souphanouvong's name and face are also seen in memorials, museums, and statues all across Laos, with a university being named after him in Luang Prabang. Due to Souphanouvong's past position as only a figurehead president and leader of the communist Pathet Lao movement with Kaysone holding the real power over Laos, the display of Souphanouvong's personality cult are seen with much lesser prominence than Kaysone.\n\nA cult of personality devoted to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi existed in Libya during his rule. His face appeared on a wide variety of items, including postage stamps, watches, and school satchels. Quotations from \"The Green Book\" appeared on a wide variety of places, from street walls to airports and even on pens, and they were also put to pop music for public release.\n\nGaddafi claimed that he disliked the personality cult surrounding him, but he tolerated it because the Libyan people adored him. Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that he was \"a populist at heart\". Throughout Libya, crowds of supporters would turn up to public events at which he appeared; described as \"spontaneous demonstrations\" by the government, there are recorded instances of groups being coerced or paid to attend.\n\nHe was typically late to public events, and he would sometimes not show up at all. Although Bianco thought that he had a \"gift for oratory\", he was considered a poor orator by biographers Blundy and Lycett. Biographer Daniel Kawczynski noted that Gaddafi was famous for his \"lengthy, wandering\" speeches, which typically involved criticizing Israel and the U.S.\n\nThe peer-reviewed academic journal \"North Korean Review\", published by the Institute for North Korean Studies at the University of Detroit Mercy in Detroit, Michigan, United States, reports that \"Like his father [Kim Jong-Il] during his lifetime, Kim Jong-un has so far avoided a cult of personality around himself that would include statues, street and place names, or images in pins or in apartments. He inherited, however, a few titles such as 'Great Sun of the 21st century,' 'Marshal,' or his father's title 'Great Leader' [widaehan ryŏngdoja]. The other 'Great Leader' [widaehan suryŏng] is still exclusively used for Kim II-sung.\"\"\n\nIn the Philippines, many local politicians engage in some sort of cult of personality. The most famous are those of former President Ferdinand Marcos, who was dictator from 1972 to 1986 and the Aquino family. They are often branded as \"epalitiko\" by the media, which is a contraction of the words \"epal\" (slang for \"attention-grabber\"), and \"pulítiko\" (\"politician\"). They put their images and their names on billboards of government projects. They also print tarpaulins, usually with their images in order to establish a sense of connection with their constituents. Senate Bill No. 1967 or Anti-Signage of Public Works Act, colloquially known as the Anti-Epal Bill, was filed by Senator Miriam Defensor Santiago on November 2011, and refiled again in July 2013 in an effort to stop the practice.\n\nA cult of personality developed in Poland around the figure of Józef Piłsudski, a Polish military commander and politician, starting from the interwar period and continuing after his death in 1935 until the present day. During the interwar period, Piłsudski's personality cult was propagated by the state media, which described him as a masterful strategist and a political visionary, and associated him with his role in regaining Polish independence in the aftermath of World War I, and his leadership in the ensuing Polish–Soviet War. It has survived decades of repression, particularly during the era of communist rule.\n\nIn modern Poland, Piłsudski is recognized as an important and largely positive figure in Polish history. Polish Independence Day is commemorated on November 11, the date when Piłsudski assumed power in Poland after the First World War.\nThe Law and Justice party builds the cult of the deceased president Lech Kaczyński\n\nIn 1986 \"The New York Times\" reporter, David Binder stated that Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu presided over \"a cult of personality that has equaled, or even surpassed, those of Stalin's Russia, Mao's China and Tito's Yugoslavia.\"\n\nInspired by the personality cult surrounding Kim Il-sung in North Korea, it started with the 1971 July Theses which reversed the liberalization of the 1960s and imposed a strict nationalist ideology. Initially, the cult of personality was only focused on Ceaușescu himself; however, by the early 1980s, his wife Elena was also a focus of the cult even to the extent that she got credit for scientific achievements which she could never have accomplished. It remained in force until the overthrow of the regime in 1989 and the couple's execution.\n\nRussia has a very long history of worshiping rulers; as the Tsars were glorified as wise and gracious leaders, some historians take the line that the communist regime adapted this tradition. In the era of Stalinism, the Soviet state fostered an extreme cult of personality around Joseph Stalin.\n\nNikita Khrushchev recalled Marx's criticism in his 1956 \"Secret Speech\" denouncing Joseph Stalin and his cult of personality to the 20th Party Congress:\nSome authors (e.g., Alexander Zinovyev) have argued that Leonid Brezhnev's rule was also characterized by a cult of personality, though unlike Stalin, Brezhnev did not initiate large-scale persecutions in the country. One of the aspects of Leonid Brezhnev's cult of personality was his obsession with titles, rewards and decorations, leading to his inflated decoration with medals, orders and so on. This was often ridiculed by the ordinary people and led to the creation of many political jokes.\n\nSome journalists and Russian oppositionists argue that there is now a cult of personality around Vladimir Putin (see also Putinism). Currently, one-fourth of the Russian population believes that a cult of personality reminiscent of Soviet Union-era leaders has developed around Vladimir Putin, while another thirty percent believed that there were increasing signs of a personality cult surrounding Putin. Evidence of this includes food products named after him. Other evidence of Putin's personality cult includes the existence of the Army of Putin, his own female fan club as well as his involvement in action man publicity stunts. According to the United States Government-funded Radio Free Europe, in December 2015, a Russian youth group by the name of \"Network\" published a book titled \"World-Changing Words: Key quotes of Vladimir Putin\", which has been compared to Mao Zedong's Little Red Book.\n\nIn Chechnya, the head of the republic Ramzan Kadyrov has been accused of creating a cult of personality around himself.\n\nA cult of personality surrounded Francisco Franco during his Falangist regime. During his regime, he was depicted like a king, for example, he wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the king), resided in the royal Pardo Palace, appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a canopy, and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were Jefe del Estado (Head of State) and \"Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles\" (Generalissimo of the Spanish Armed Forces), he was referred to as \"Caudillo de España por la gracia de Dios,\" (By the Grace of God, the Leader of Spain). \"Por la Gracia de Dios\" is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in absolute monarchies, and it had only been used by monarchs before Franco used it himself. \n\nAs one of his strategies to maintain power over Syria, Hafez al-Assad developed a state-sponsored cult of personality. Portraits of him, often depicting him engaging in heroic activities, were placed in every public space. He named myriad numbers of places and institutions in Syria after himself, and other members of his family. At school, children were taught to sing songs of adulation for Hafez al-Assad. Teachers would begin each school day with the slogan \"Our eternal leader, Hafez al-Assad\". The personality cult that he developed portrayed him as a wise, modest and just leader of the country. This strategy of creating a cult of personality was continued by Hafez's son and the later Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThailand's former King Bhumibol Adulyadej (1946-2016) is officially venerated in a personality cult, both during his reign and after his death. The Kingdom is disseminated with huge portraits of him, his son and successor King Vajiralongkorn, and other members of the royal family. He was also protected by lèse majesté laws which allow critics to be jailed for three to fifteen years.\nPresident of the Togolese Republic Gnassingbé Eyadéma had a personality cult of titanic proportions, including, but not limited to, an entourage of one thousand dancing women who sang and danced in praise of him; schoolchildren beginning their day by singing his praises; portraits which adorned most stores; a bronze statue in the capital city, Lomé; $20 wristwatches with his portrait, which disappeared and re-appeared every fifteen seconds; and even a comic book that depicted him as a superhero with powers of invulnerability and superhuman strength. In addition, the date of a failed attempt on Eyadéma's life was annually commemorated as \"the Feast of Victory Over Forces of Evil.\" Eyadéma even changed his first name from Étienne to Gnassingbé to note the date of the 1974 plane crash of which he was claimed to be the only survivor.\n\nIn Turkey, founder of the Turkish Republic Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is commemorated by a myriad of memorials throughout the country, such as the Atatürk International Airport in Istanbul, the Atatürk Bridge over the Golden Horn (Haliç), the Atatürk Dam, and Atatürk Stadium. His titles include Great Leader (Ulu Önder), Eternal Commander (Ebedî Başkomutan), Head Teacher (Baş Öğretmen), and Eternal Chief (Ebedî Şef). Atatürk statues have been erected in all Turkish cities by the Turkish Government, and most towns have their own memorial to him. His face and name are seen and heard everywhere in Turkey; his portrait can be seen in all public buildings, in all schools and classrooms, on all school textbooks, on all Turkish lira banknotes, and in the homes of many Turkish families. At the exact time of his death, on every 10 November, at 09:05, most vehicles and people in the country's streets pause for one minute in remembrance. In 1951, the outlawing () or representing him, which is still in force. A government website was created to denounce the websites that violate this law, and the Turkish government as of 2011 has filters in place to block websites deemed to contain materials insulting to his memory.\n\nThe start of Atatürk's cult of personality is placed in the 1920s when the first statues started being built. The idea of Atatürk as the \"father of the Turks\" is ingrained in Turkish politics and politicians in that country are evaluated in relation to his cult of personality. The persistence of the phenomenon of Atatürk's personality cult has become an area of deep interest to scholars.\n\nAtatürk impersonators are also seen around Turkey much after Atatürk's death to preserve what is called the \"world's longest-running personality cult\".\n\nIn recent years there has been a growing cult of personality in modern Turkey around current President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nSaparmurat Niyazov, who was President of Turkmenistan from 1985 to 2006, is another oft-cited cultivator of a cult of personality. Niyazov simultaneously cut funding to and partially disassembled the education system in the name of \"reform\", while injecting ideological indoctrination into it by requiring all schools to use his own book, the Ruhnama, as their primary text, and like Kim Il-sung, there is even a creation myth surrounding him. During Niyazov's presidency there was no freedom of the press nor was there freedom of speech. This further meant that opposition to Niyazov was strictly forbidden and major opposition figures have been imprisoned, institutionalized, deported, or they have fled the country, and their family members are routinely harassed by the authorities. Additionally, a silhouette of Niyazov was used as a logo on television broadcasts, Krasnovodsk town was renamed \"Turkmenbashi\" after him, and schools, airports and even a meteorite are also named after him and members of his family. Statues and pictures of him were also \"erected everywhere\". For these, and other reasons, the US government said that by the time he died, \"Niyazov's personality cult … had reached the dimensions of a state-imposed religion.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch, in its \"World Report 2012\", says there is a cult of personality of President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow and that it is strengthening. Agence France-Presse reports a developing personality cult. Reporters Without Borders says the president is promoting a cult of personality around himself and that his portraits have taken the place of the ones of the previous president.\nA number of scholarly papers and peer-reviewed articles have assessed the personality cult that some claim has developed around U.S. president Donald Trump. One is in a paper that appeared in the 2016 American Political Science Association Annual Meeting. In the paper, Sarah Oates, from the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism, and Wendy W. Moe, from the University of Maryland Robert H. Smith School of Business, discussed the subject broadly and then stated that \"during the 2016 Presidential primaries, the 'cult of personality' candidate, Trump, won the primary.\" Another is in a book by University of Dayton distinguished professor of history Larry Schweikart and political commentator and author Joel Pollak. In their book, \"How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution\", they state that \"some conservatives looked forward to Trump's defeat as a chance to rid the GOP of the insufficiently conservative insurgents who were bringing it to defeat by choosing a candidate who was a mere reality-show Hollywood celebrity, a lifetime liberal who was hijacking their party and their cause with a vain cult of personality.\" A third was written by ethnologists Jonathan Rosa and Yarimar Bonilla who wrote, \"although we do not minimize the devastating impact that [Trump] administration's policies will have, or the new president's ominous behavior, we are wary of exceptionalizing the current moment. Our goal is thus to deprovincialize Trump, that is, to locate his election within broader historical, political, and economic assemblages of which it is but one part.\"...\"This effort might include [studying] Trump's xenophobia, bombast, and cult of personality, reminiscent of leaders in South Africa, Gambia, Uganda, Libya, and Zimbabwe.\" Also, stressing Trumps's own actions towards strengthening his own cult of personality, University of London U.S. Centre on American Politics and Policy's Daniel Kato noted that \"according to political theorist Hannah Arendt's thinking Trump may yet hunker down, drawing strength from the resistance to him, and continue to consolidate his cult of personality.\"\n\nMany articles, editorials, and even a number of elected officials on both ends of the political spectrum have noted Trump's emerging cult of personality, while others have cited in particular his repeated claim that \"the news media are the enemy of the people\" as one hallmark of such a central figure, deriving directly from Stalin's use of the phrase.\n\nIn Venezuela, a cult of personality has been created around the late President Hugo Chavez, in which his supporters venerate him. Chávez largely received his support through his charisma and by spending Venezuela's oil funds on the poor. Since his death, his followers, known as \"Chavistas\" refer to his death as a \"transition to immortality\", commonly calling Chávez the \"eternal commander\". Among his followers, Chávez has been compared to holy figures, especially by his successor Nicolás Maduro.\n\nAccording to Tomas Straka of Andres Bello University, Chávez's cult of personality began following the 1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts which Chávez led, with Straka explaining that some Venezuelans \"saw no solution to their most fundamental problems and they saw in Chávez a savior, or an avenger of those groups that had no hope\". Since the beginning of Chávez's tenure in 1999, the Venezuelan government manipulated the Venezuelan public with social programs depicting him as a great leader for the people. The struggles that Chávez endured throughout his presidency, such as the 2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt, also drew compassion from his followers which boosted his support. By the time of Chávez's death, speculation about potential Chavista reactions to his death were compared to the sorrow felt by those in North Korea who mourned the death of Kim Jong-il, with one scholar of Latin America from the University of California Santa Barbara, Juan Pablo Lupi, stating that the creation of Chávez's cult of personality was \"very well-staged, all this process of myth-making and appealing to the feelings and religious sentiment of the people. This is something that is quasi-religious\". The creation of Chávez's cult of personality was a strategy used by his government to maintain legitimacy before and after his death.\n\nThe Vietnamese communist regime has continually maintained a personality cult around Ho Chi Minh since the 1950s in the North, and it was later extended to the South after reunification, which it sees as a crucial part of its propaganda campaign surrounding Ho and the Party's past. Ho Chi Minh is frequently glorified in schools by schoolchildren. Opinions, publications and broadcasts that are critical of Ho Chi Minh or that identify his flaws are banned in Vietnam, and the commentators are arrested or fined for \"opposing the people's revolution\". Ho Chi Minh is even glorified to a religious status as an \"immortal saint\" by the Vietnamese Communist Party, and some people \"worship the President\", according to a BBC report.\n\nThe former capital of South Vietnam, Saigon, was officially renamed Ho Chi Minh City on 1 May 1975, one day after its capture, which officially ended the Vietnam War.\n\nJosip Broz Tito (in power from 1945 until 1980) developed cult of personality around himself. His cult is described as a combination of a \"peasant chief, protector and the legendary hero\". During his lifetime, his cult of personality included, among other things, naming places after him (including four cities), celebrations of his birthday (including Relay of Youth), widespread use of his portraits, writing his name in landscapes, so they can be seen from the air, etc.\n\nMobutu Sese Seko used his cult of personality to create a god-like public image of himself in Zaire, which today is the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mobutu created a totalitarian state, amassed massive wealth for himself and presided over the economic deterioration of his country and human rights abuses.\n\nHe used mass media communications to entrench his rule.\n\nMobutu embarked on a campaign of pro-African cultural awareness and in 1972, he formally changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga (\"The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.\")\n\nPeople's Mujahedin of Iran has built a vast cult of personality around its leaders Masoud and Maryam Rajavi.\n\n"}

Webster's definition states that the word \"régime\" refers simply to a form of government, while Oxford English Dictionary defines \"regime\" as \"a government, especially an authoritarian one\". \n\nContemporary academic usage of the term \"regime\" is broader than popular and journalistic usage, meaning \"an intermediate stratum between the government (which makes day-to-day decisions and is easy to alter) and the state (which is a complex bureaucracy tasked with a range of coercive functions).\" In global studies and international relations the concept of \"regime\" is also used to name international regulatory agencies (see International regime), which lie outside of the control of national governments. Some authors thus distinguish analytically between institutions and regimes while recognizing that they are bound up with each other:\n\nIn other words, regimes can be defined as sets of protocols and norms embedded either in institutions or institutionalized practices – formal such as states or informal such as the \"liberal trade regime\" – that are publicly enacted and relatively enduring.\n\n"}

In short, when pronouns are capitalized which usually are lowercase, this usually implies that the writer personally reveres and regards as a deity the antecedent of that pronoun.\n\nNouns, which are not proper names, can also be capitalized out of reverence of the entity they refer to. Such examples include \"the Lord\", \"the Father\", \"the Creator\".\n\nCapitalization, punctuation, and spelling were not well standardized in early Modern English; for example, the 1611 King James Bible has:\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, it became common to capitalize all nouns, as is still done in some other Germanic languages such as in German:\n\nIn languages that capitalize all nouns, reverential capitalization of the first two letters or the whole word can sometimes be seen. The following is an example from Danish, which capitalized nouns until 1948.\n\nNote that some instances are in all caps (' \"GOD\"), and some begin with two capital letters (' \"LOrd\", ' \"JEsus\"). Some words that could also be said to refer to an almighty being begin with a single capital (' \"Creator\", ' \"Christ\", ' \"the Father\"), but so do all other nouns (\"\" \"Things\"). This type of reverential capitalization varies within a single sentence and would also be dependent on the author and the publisher of a work.\n\nThe convention of capitalizing nouns was abandoned in English, and one of the people who were influential in this was Benjamin Blayney, who produced a 1769 edition of the Bible in which nouns were not capitalized—possibly simply to save space on the printed page. In the 19th century, it became common to capitalize pronouns referring to the Christian God, in order to show respect:\n\nIn the 20th century this practice became far less common:\n\nToday there is no widely accepted rule in English on whether or not to use reverential capitalization. Different house styles have different rules given by their style manuals. Reverential capitalization is not to be used, for example, according to the style guidelines set by the Chicago Manual of Style or the Associated Press Stylebook. It is prescribed, for example, by the US Government Printing Office Style Manual (2008).\n\nThis capitalization rule is also customarily applied in Tagalog and other languages of the Philippines, despite being considered nonstandard and inconsistent by purists who contend that this rule is applied only in English.\n"}
{"id": "34335401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34335401", "title": "Separation of powers in the United Kingdom", "text": "Separation of powers in the United Kingdom\n\nThe conception of the separation of powers has been applied to the United Kingdom and the nature of its executive (UK government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland Executive), judicial (England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) and legislative (UK Parliament, Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales and Northern Ireland Assembly) functions. Historically, the apparent merger of the executive and the legislature, with a powerful Prime Minister drawn from the largest party in parliament and usually with a safe majority, led theorists to contend that the separation of powers is not applicable to the United Kingdom. However, in recent years it does seem to have been adopted as a necessary part of the UK constitution.\n\nThe independence of the judiciary has never been questioned as a principle, although application is problematic. Personnel have been increasingly isolated from the other organs of government, no longer sitting in the House of Lords or in the Cabinet. The court's ability to legislate through precedent, its inability to question validly enacted law through legislative supremacy and parliamentary sovereignty, and the role of the Europe-wide institutions to legislate, execute and judge on matters also define the boundaries of the UK system.\n\nAlthough the United Kingdom recognises parliamentary sovereignty, writers have stressed the importance of the independence of the judiciary in establishing the rule of law, among them Trevor Allan. The role of the separation of powers has changed with the rise of judicial involvement in the affairs of government. Albert Venn Dicey, writing in 1915 in \"Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution\", described the separation of powers as \"the offspring of a double misconception\". More recently Sir Ivor Jennings has argued that it is of little relevance, and, faced with the role of the executive within the legislature, some authors describe only the independence of the judiciary as evidence that the model applies to the modern United Kingdom.\n\nFew critics of the applicability of the separation of powers to the United Kingdom question the basic division.\nThe separation of powers has come under the stress of increasing government intervention into social issues outside its former remit dominated by administration and foreign and military policy – the creation of big government. This has been seen by some as having led to a weakening of the concept of government, replaced with the concept of governance. This lends itself to a more flexible approach considering the wide variation in the sorts of things that the \"executive\" does. A similar approach is to take an approach of public choice theory. The self-interest of political actors, under this theory, bridges the separate sections of government, drawing upon the approach of the Committee on Standards in Public Life which applies the same rules to different organs, although heir approach to judges is separate. Either theory would accept that there are wider decision making processes which are not restricted to a single branch of government. Another important idea is that variations within each separate part of government are as significant as differences in approach between branches, and require similar consideration.\n\nHowever, Lord Mustill summarised the prevailing modern viewpoint in the 1995 judgment, \"R. v Home Secretary ex parte Fire Brigades Union\":\n\nIt is a feature of the peculiarly UK conception of the separation of powers that Parliament, the executive and the courts each have their distinct and largely exclusive domain. Parliament has a legally unchallengeable right to make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries on the administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred on it by law. The courts interpret the laws and see that they are obeyed.\nThe UK Parliament creates law through the authority of the Queen-in-Parliament, securing the support of at least the House of Commons, and usually the House of Lords as well – although since the passing act of the Parliament Act 1911 this has not been necessary. Under the European Communities Act 1972, the organs of the European Communities to legislate for the United Kingdom was recognised, by virtue of that Act. The power to create primary legislation has also been devolved to Scottish and Welsh parliaments and to government ministers and local authorities to create secondary legislation.\n\nThe executive comprises all official and public authorities (including local authorities) that govern the UK, from initiating and implementing legislation to the running of local and national services, such as rubbish collections and the police. The civil service remains non-partisan (having little in common with the Cabinet and Prime Minister in that respect). The executive also exercises a number of powers under the Royal Prerogative, including foreign relations; many other actions are taken in the sovereign's name, from whom executive power is derived. The Council and the Commission of the European Union also exercise executive power, as do devolved governments. Within the executive, there is no longer a clear elected–non-elected divide: decision-makers are of both sorts since the widening of the government's remit. The extent to which the Civil Service serves the government, rather than usurping it, is one character of the executive.\n\nThe judicial function determines the outcome of disputes and performs minor legislative and administrative functions. It oversees both public and private law through civil and criminal courts and a variety of tribunals. The Human Rights Act 1998 has placed a requirement that courts take into account the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nThe introduction of a tax is a legislative function; collecting tax is an executive and administrative function; settling tax disputes is a judicial function, as is judicial review of executive decisions. However, such an approach does not in itself enlighten what each role entails: the audit of public expenditure was a judicial function in the fourteenth century; an executive one in the eighteenth; and is now a legislative function. This is not in itself a measure of efficiency or good process, or what the function actually entails.\n\nThe separation of powers may require, depending on interpretation, that the membership of the three powers must be separate; that one of the three powers does not control the work of another; or that one organ of government should not exercise the powers of another. Keeping all three roles separate is seen as both theoretically and practically impossible.\n\nThe legislature and executive have a close relationship in the UK constitution. This led Walter Bagehot to declare the \"nearly complete fusion\" of the roles in the nineteenth century. Other writers have stressed that the harmonisation of the legislature and executive does not preclude their distinctiveness. By convention, government ministers are drawn from one of the two houses; the weight of democratic responsibility entails that most come from the House of Commons. There is, however, a limit on their number. Most other members of the executive are excluded from holding legislative office, including the Civil Service, the armed forces, and the police, some of whom are prevented from becoming involved in any political affairs. The crossover in personnel is effectively limited to ministers. The Prime Minister wields considerable power on behalf of the executive, as party leader and chief spokesperson for government policy.\n\nWhen the government has a clear majority it wields a lot of power to push through legislation. A 1978 Select Committee report suggested:\n\nThe balance of advantage between Parliament and Government is so weighted in favour of Government that it is inimical to the proper working of our parliamentary democracy.\n\nBetween 1979 and 2010, the government had a safe majority which made the scrutiny of the government more difficult, although not impossible. The government could rely on its legislation being passed, although in some cases this did not happen. The Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition complicated the party structure, since the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, served as Deputy Prime Minister under a Conservative Prime Minister. However, the legislature can oust a government through a vote of no confidence, as happened in 1979. This was driven by a growth in the political party structure, enforced through party discipline, as increased suffrage meant a far wider remit of government policy platforms.\n\nSecondary legislation – where Parliament passes limited legislative rights to the executive through an Act of Parliament – is also problematic, although necessary for the efficient working of government. Legal rules should be relatable to the Acts of Parliament on which they are based, but this is not always possible. Proper scrutiny of government actions under secondary legislation is needed to prevent abuse.\n\nThe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council remains an independent court, despite being organisationally part of the executive. The Lord Chancellor, a member of the Cabinet is no longer a judge since the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. The Attorney General (England and Wales) and the Lord Advocate (Scotland) have \"quasi-judicial roles\" but are part of the executive.\n\nIn terms of control, the independence of the judiciary is confirmed through statute, constitutional convention, and weight of opinion. In England and Wales, judges in superior courts cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by the executive, instead serving whilst in \"good behaviour\". Those in lower courts have similar protection from dismissal without due cause. Most members of tribunals cannot be dismissed by members of the government department of which they form part. This is important in cases of judicial review and other judicial methods of preventing government abuse of power.\n\nThe judiciary undertake minor legislative functions in the form of court procedure, which, whilst the performance of a conflicting power, strengthens their independence. Tribunals are tied, but remain independent from, the executive. Government departments adjudicate on many decisions, and are required to take principles such as fairness and transparency into account in return. The courts provide only one method of dispute resolution, albeit one that is important where the government is one party and independence is necessary. The picture of which decision-making processes should be assigned to which body is complicated. There remain problems with the scope of role of the Home Secretary in the penal system and judicial decisions with regard to sentencing. Nolan LJ, in \"M v Home Office\", noted that:\n\nThe proper constitutional relationship of the executive with the courts is that the courts will respect all acts of the executive within its lawful province, and that the executive will respect all decisions of the courts as to what its lawful province is.\nIn matters such as Extradition of British nationals, courts must first consent and the Home Secretary must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the individual cannot be extradited. A recent example of this is autistic computer-hacker Gary McKinnon being extradited to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be extradited and that it would not harm him. However the Home Secretary announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide.\n\nThe judges of the Supreme Court do not sit in the House of Lords. Until 2009, the judges appointed as Law Lords formed part of the House of Lords in Parliament. The creation of the Supreme Court ended confusion in name of both capacities. No Member of Parliament may hold a full-time position in the judiciary.\n\nThe departure of the judiciary from the House of Lords has led to greater tension between the government, Parliament and the courts, as the senior judges are no longer able to amend and speak on Bills and Peers are no longer able to question the judges and thereby hold them to account.\n\nThe legislature retains the right to impeach members of the judiciary by agreement of both houses, but this has only happened once in three hundred years. There are restrictions on the criticism of judges in parliament. Courts are bound to interpret Acts of Parliament, even retrospectively, and legislative supremacy dictates that they cannot declare properly enacted law invalid. They are not bound by other resolutions of either house. The European Communities Act 1972 places a legislature-imposed requirement on the judiciary to follow European case law in relevant matters. Although the Human Rights Act 1998 allows the courts to make a declaration of incompatibility, they cannot disapply legislation.\n\nEach House of Parliament retains the right to punish offenders within its walls (including exclusive cognisance), with the potential to cause conflict. However, \"R v Chaytor\" confirmed that right was limited in scope, and that it was the court that decided what that scope was. It was considered very unlikely that parliament would seek to protect those guilty of a crime unrelated to parliamentary business in this way. The courts have also exercised a quasi-legislative power through precedent – for example, ending the marital rape exemption in \"\". There is particular scope for the identification and application of personal liberties, and some cases have shaped the judiciary–legislature relationship.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27564743", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27564743", "title": "Status of the Irish language", "text": "Status of the Irish language\n\nIrish is a main home, work or community language for approximately 2% of the population of the Republic of Ireland; the population of the Republic of Ireland was shown as 4,761,865 in the 2016 census.\nThe 2011 census in Northern Ireland showed that Irish is the home language of 0.2% of people, with 6% of people able to speak Irish to varying degrees (see Irish language in Northern Ireland). One in four people (~1.7 million) on the island of Ireland claims to understand Irish to some extent. Estimates of fully native Irish language speakers range from 40,000 up to 80,000 people. Areas in which the language remains a vernacular are referred to as \"Gaeltacht\" areas.\n\nIrish is the least widely spoken among the 24 official languages of the European Union. The use of the language in the Irish diaspora has been declining steadily.\n\nIrish speakers outside the Gaeltacht include both second-language speakers and native speakers who were raised and educated through Irish. They are sometimes known as and constitute an expanding minority, though of uncertain size. They are predominantly urban dwellers. Present trends make it likely that they represent the future of the language and a guarantee of its survival.\n\nRecent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own and that Irish speakers from urban areas can find it difficult to understand Irish speakers from the Gaeltacht. This is related to an urban tendency to simplify the phonetic and grammatical structure of the language. The written standard remains the same for both groups, and urban Irish speakers have made notable contributions to an extensive modern literature.\n\nIt has been argued that tend to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers, and enjoy the benefits of language-based networking, leading to better employment and higher social status. Though this initial study has been criticised for certain assumptions, the statistical evidence supports the view that such bilinguals enjoy certain educational advantages; and the 2016 Republic of Ireland census noted that daily Irish language speakers were more highly educated than the population generally in Ireland. Of those daily Irish speakers who had completed their education, 49 per cent had a third level degree or higher at university or college level. This compared to a rate of 28 per cent for the state overall.\n\nWhile the number of fluent urban speakers is rising (largely because of the growth of urban Irish-medium education), Irish in the Gaeltacht grows steadily weaker. The 2016 census showed that inhabitants of the officially designated Gaeltacht regions of Ireland numbered 96,090 people: down from 96,628 in the 2011 census. Of these, 66.3% claimed to speak Irish, down from 68.5% in 2011; and only 21.4% or 20,586 people said they spoke Irish daily outside the education system. It was estimated in 2007 that, outside the cities, about 17,000 people lived in strongly Irish-speaking communities, about 10,000 people lived in areas where there was substantial use of the language, and 17,000 people lived in \"weak\" Gaeltacht communities. In no part of the Gaeltacht was Irish the only language. Complete or functional monolingualism in Irish is now restricted to a relatively small number of children under school age.\n\nA comprehensive study published in 2007 on behalf of Údarás na Gaeltachta found that young people in the Gaeltacht, despite their largely favourable view of Irish, use the language less than their elders. Even in areas where the language is strongest, only 60% of young people use Irish as the main language of communication with family and neighbours, and English is preferred in other contexts. The study concluded that, on current trends, the survival of Irish as a community language in Gaeltacht areas is unlikely. A follow-up report by the same author published in 2015 concluded that Irish would die as a community language in the Gaeltacht within a decade.\n\nIn 2010 the Irish government launched the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 which is designed to strengthen the language in all areas and greatly increase the number of habitual speakers. This includes the encouragement of Irish-speaking districts in areas where Irish has been replaced by English. The 2015 independent report on the Gaeltacht commissioned by Údarás na Gaeltachta, however, does not regard this strategy as likely to be successful without a radical change in policy at national level.\n\nOn 13 June 2005, the EU foreign ministers unanimously decided to make Irish an official language of the European Union. The new arrangements came into effect on 1 January 2007, and Irish was first used at a meeting of the EU Council of Ministers, by Minister Noel Treacy TD, on 22 January 2007.\n\nThe vast majority of Irish in the Republic are, in practice, monolingual English speakers. Habitual users of Irish fall generally into two categories: traditional speakers in rural areas (a group in decline) and urban Irish speakers (a group that is expanding). \nThe number of native Irish-speakers in Gaeltacht areas of the Republic of Ireland today is a smaller fraction of the population than it was at independence. Many Irish-speaking families encouraged their children to speak English as it was the language of education and employment; by the nineteenth century the Irish-speaking areas were relatively poor and remote, though this very remoteness helped the language survive as a vernacular. There was also continuous outward migration of Irish speakers from the Gaeltacht (see related issues at Irish diaspora).\n\nA more recent contributor to the decline of Irish in the Gaeltacht has been the immigration of English speakers and the return of native Irish speakers with English-speaking partners. The Planning and Development Act (2000) attempted to address the latter issue, with varied levels of success. It has been argued that government grants and infrastructure projects have encouraged the use of English: \"only about half Gaeltacht children learn Irish in the home... this is related to the high level of in-migration and return migration which has accompanied the economic restructuring of the Gaeltacht in recent decades\". In a last-ditch effort to stop the demise of Irish-speaking in Connemara in Galway, planning controls have been introduced on the building of new homes in Irish-speaking areas. New housing in Gaeltacht areas must be allocated to English-speakers and Irish-speakers in the same ratio as the existing population of the area. It was reported on Nuacht RTÉ and Nuacht TG4 in November 2017 that most councils with Gaeltacht areas have not implemented this policy though since it came in.\n\nAccording to the 2016 Republic of Ireland census 73,803 people speak the Irish language daily in the Republic of Ireland outside the education system including 20,586 people who speak it every day in the Gaeltacht outside the education system. However, only 8,068 census 2016 forms were completed in Irish. Some Irish speakers have called for the census form to be provided solely in bilingual format every five years to make the Irish language version easier for Irish-speaking citizens to avail of.\n\nThis is a List of Irish counties by the percentage of those professing some ability in the Irish language in the Republic of Ireland in the 2016 census. The census did not record Irish speakers living outside of the Republic of Ireland.\n\nAccording to Bank of Ireland fewer than 1% of their customers use the Irish language option on their pass machines.\n\nIn 2002 the Government of Ireland published the first draft of a bill aimed at providing more services of a higher quality through Irish in the public sector. The bill was passed unanimously by both the Dáil and the Seanad in summer 2003. On 14 July 2003, An tUachtarán (President) signed the Official Languages Act 2003 into law, and the provisions of the Act were gradually brought into force over a phased period of several years and are still not phased in fully. This was the first time the provision of services in general through Irish by the state system was placed on a statutory footing. It is hoped that the first Official Languages Act Amendments Bill will be brought before the Irish Houses of Parliament in 2018.\n\nThe aim of the Official Languages Act 2003 is to increase and improve in an organised manner, over a period of time, the quantity and quality of services provided for the public through Irish by public bodies. The Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga ( \"The Language Commissioner\") was established under the Official Languages Act as an independent statutory office operating as an ombudsman's service and as a compliance agency.\nIn 2006 the government announced a 20-year strategy to help Ireland become a substantially more bilingual country which was launched on 20 December 2010. This involves a 13-point plan and encouraging the use of language in all aspects of life. It aims to strengthen the language in both the Gaeltacht and the Galltacht (see 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030).\n\nArticle 8 of the Constitution states the following:\nThe interpretation of 8.3 has been problematical and various judgments have cast more light on this matter.\n\nIn 1983 Justice Ó hAnnluain noted that Irish is referred to in the present Constitution as 'the first official language' and that the Oireachtas itself can give priority to one language over the other. Until that time it should be assumed that Irish is the first official language, and that the citizen is entitled to require that it be used in administration.\nIn 1988 Justice Ó hAnnluain said it was fair to provide official forms in both Irish and English.\n\nIn 2001 Justice Hardiman said that \"the individual who seeks basic legal materials in Irish will more than likely be conscious of causing embarrassment to the officials from whom he seeks them and will certainly become conscious that his business will be much more rapidly and efficaciously dealt with if he resorts to English. I can only say that this situation is an offence to the letter and spirit of the Constitution\".\"\n\nIn 2009, however, Justice Charleton said that the State has the right to use documents in either language and that there is no risk of an unfair trial if an applicant understands whichever language is used.\n\nIn 2010 Justice Macken said that there was a constitutional obligation to provide to a respondent all Rules of Court in an Irish language version as soon as practicable after they were published in English.\n\nThe Irish text of the Constitution takes precedence over the English text (Articles 25.4.6° and 63). However, the second amendment included changes to the Irish text to align it more closely with the English text, rather than vice versa. The Constitution provides for a number of Irish language terms that are to be used even in English.\n\nThe Placenames Order/ 2004 requires the original Irish placenames to be used in the Gaeltacht on all official documents, maps and roadsigns. This has removed the legal status of those placenames in the Gaeltacht in English. Opposition to these measures comes from several quarters, including some people in popular tourist destinations located within the Gaeltacht (namely in Dingle) who claim that tourists may not recognise the Irish forms of the placenames.\n\nFollowing a campaign in the 1960s and early 1970s, most road-signs in Gaeltacht regions have been in Irish only. Most maps and government documents did not change, though Ordnance Survey (government) maps showed placenames bilingually in the Gaeltacht (and generally in English only elsewhere). Most commercial map companies retained the English placenames, leading to some confusion. The Act therefore updates government documents and maps in line with what has been reality in the Gaeltacht for the past 30 years. Private map companies are expected to follow suit.\n\nBeyond the Gaeltacht, only English placenames were officially recognised (pre 2004). But further placenames orders have been passed to enable both the English and Irish placenames to be used. An example of present inconsistency is the village of Straffan, designated variously as , and . In the 1830s John O'Donovan listed it as \"Srufáin\" The nearby village of Kilteel was \"Cill tSile\" for centuries, meaning \"The church of Saint Síle\", but since 2000 it has been shown as \"Cill Cheile\", which does not carry the same meaning.\n\nIrish vehicle registration plates are bilingual: the county of registration is shown in Irish above the plate number as a kind of surtitle, and is encoded from English within the plate number. For example, a Dublin plate is subtitled \"Baile Átha Cliath\" and the plate number includes D.\n\nConradh na Gaeilge has expressed concern over the proposed introduction of postcodes, which, similarly, may use abbreviations based on English language place names, although people sending mail would still be able to use addresses in Irish. It has advocated that postcodes should either consist solely of numbers, as in many other bilingual countries, or be based on Irish language names instead.\n\nThe cost of implementing a \"Bilingualism Policy\" has been queried both in Ireland and elsewhere. In Britain Lord Browne of Belmont asked the British Government what the cost was of implementing the Welsh Language Act 1993 throughout statutory agencies and departments in Wales. Lord Evans of Temple Guiting replied that \"Departments and public bodies varied in the level of Welsh language service which they were providing or planning to provide prior to the 1993 Act. Since they would have been accommodated within existing budgets, it is not possible to make an assessment of any additional costs flowing specifically from the requirements of the Act.\"\n\nIn a 2011 comment on Irish education, Professor Ed Walsh deplored the fact that the State spends about €1,000,000,000 p.a. on teaching Irish, although it was not specified how he arrived at this figure. He called for a\n\n…phased reallocation of part of the €1 billion committed each year to teaching Irish is a good place to start. All students should be introduced to the Irish language at primary level, but after that resources should be directed only to those who have shown interest and commitment. The old policies of compulsion that have so inhibited the restoration of the language should be abandoned.\n\nProfessor Walsh's remarks provoked further comment for and against his suggestion.\n\nMost private companies in Ireland have no formal Irish language provision. Tesco Ireland and some SuperValu stores have some in-store Irish signage. Top Oil garages have some Irish language signage in their garages and O'Briens sandwich cafés have Irish language \"Fáilte\" (\"Welcome\") signs in their cafés. Bank of Ireland ATMs in many places have an Irish Language option and AIB ATM's display some Irish. Samsung phones have an Irish Language option and Meteor has also begun to offer an Irish language voicemail option to its customers. People corresponding with state bodies can send and receive correspondence in Irish or English although this provision is not complete in some semi-state companies yet. The ESB, Irish Rail/Iarnród Éireann and Irish Water/Uisce Éireann have Irish-speaking customer support representatives and offer both Irish and English language options on their phone lines, along with written communication in both languages. These services are being phased in to all State organisations. The Emergency response number 112 or 999 also have agents who deal with emergency calls in both languages. Fuji Film have introduced an Irish language interface option to all Fuji Film kiosks around the world.\n\nAll state companies are obliged to have bilingual signage and stationery and have Irish language options on their websites with the Official Languages Act 2003 although these provisions have not been fully implemented in some state companies. InterCity (Iarnród Éireann) and Commuter (Iarnród Éireann) trains, Luas trams and Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus buses display the names of their destinations bilingually and their internal signage and automated oral announcements on their vehicles are bilingual and tickets can be ordered from Luas ticket machines in Irish along with in some other languages.\n\nMany of the main social media forum websites have Irish language options. These include Facebook, Twitter, Google, Gmail and Wordpress.\nSeveral computer software products also have an Irish language option. Prominent examples include Microsoft Office, KDE,\nMozilla Firefox,\nMozilla Thunderbird,\nOpenOffice.org,\nand Microsoft Windows XP.\n\nHiberno-English has been heavily influenced by the Irish language, and words derived from Irish, including whole phrases, continue to be a feature of English as spoken in Ireland: (\"goodbye\"), (\"get home safely\"), (\"good health\"; used when drinking like \"bottoms up\" or \"cheers\"). The term \"craic\" has been popularised in a Gaelicised spelling: \"How's the \"craic?\"\" or \"What's the craic?\" (\"how's the fun?\"/\"how is it going?\").\n\nAn Taibhdhearc based in Galway is the national Irish language theatre. There is also a theatre Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair based in the Donegal Gaeltacht. Sometimes plays through Irish are performed in other venues in Ireland.\n\nMost public bodies have Irish language or bilingual names. An Post, the Republic's postal service, displays Irish place names outside their offices along with most of their internal signage with equal prominence in both Irish and English and continue to have their stamps issued in Irish and display place names in Irish on their postmarks as well as recognise addresses printed or written in Irish. Other examples of State bodies or companies with Irish names include Bus Éireann and Bord na Móna. Traditionally, the private sector has been less supportive. Tesco Ireland have announced that their new main aisle signage will be bilingual when new shops of theirs open and when current monolingual English language signage is getting replaced and they are also considering bringing in an Irish language option on their self-service checkouts. Top Oil garages have Irish language signage in their garages and O'Briens sandwich cafés have \"Fáilte\" (\"Welcome\") signs on their doors. In contrast, the \"100% Irish\" SuperValu on the other hand have no Irish signs in many of their stores as do not many Lidl, Aldi, Marks & Spencer and most international retailers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and indeed even most Irish owned retailers or companies. In Galway the inaction of most businesses to incorporate the Irish language into their services e.g. on signage despite the county having a large Gaeltacht area led to the establishment of Gaillimh le Gaeilge (\"Galway with Irish\") in the city. They have had a lot of success in promoting the Irish language in the business and commercial sector in the city. There is now a Cill Dara le Gaeilge organisation in Kildare and Gnó Mhaigh Eo in Mayo working with the business sectors in those counties also and it is envisaged that there will be many other such organisations set up in other Irish counties.\n\nIn 2016 it was announced that Galway City, Dingle and Letterkenny would be the first recognised Bailte Seirbhísí Gaeltachta (Gaeltacht Service Towns) under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 subject to them adopting and implementing approved language plans. It is expected that more areas will be designated as formal Bailte Seirbhísí Gaeltachta in the future.\n\nIn 2018 it was announced that five areas outside the Gaeltacht on the island of Ireland are going to be formally recognised as the first Líonraí Gaeilge (Irish Language Networks) under the Gaeltacht Act 2012. The areas are Belfast, Loughrea, Carn Tóchair, Ennis and Clondalkin. \n\nSignage in Irish may be viewed as a gesture of goodwill towards the language. It does not necessarily imply that any of the staff in a particular establishment can speak Irish.\n\nThanks in large part to Gael-Taca and Gaillimh le Gaeilge a significant number of new residential areas are named in Irish today in a lot of counties in the Republic of Ireland. What may be surprising to many people is that these initiatives only really kicked off in a big way since the early 1990s when Galway City councillors passed a policy that all new residential areas in the Galway City Council area would be named solely in Irish. The initiatives spread to most other Irish counties during the Celtic Tiger 2000's property boom in Ireland in large part also thanks to the Gael-Taca free service to property developers to give them some optional choices of names in Irish for their developments. Over 500 new residential areas were named in Irish during the early-to-late 2000's property boom in Ireland. A lot of counties in Ireland have proportionally few solely Irish language named areas though including the capital Dublin and four counties in Northern Ireland have none. There have been few new residential areas built in Ireland outside the Greater Dublin Area since the Great Recession.\n\nIn an effort to increase the use of the Irish language by the State, the Official Languages Act was passed in 2003. This act ensures that state bodies have to have services through the medium of Irish for Irish speakers; bilingual signage, websites and stationery. Major publications issued by state and semi-state bodies must also be available in both official languages. In addition, the Office of An Coimisinéir Teanga (The Language Commissioner) has been set up to act as an ombudsman with regard to equal treatment for both languages. The Official Languages Act is being implemented on a phased basis. The Official Languages Amendment Bill (2015) was expected to be brought before the Irish houses of Parliament before the end of the Fine Gael-Labour Government's 2011-2016 term in office but now is expected to be left to the next Government to bring in. The bill has been drafted and it is expected that amongst other changes in future it will be legal for Government Departments and local Government major reports or publications to be exclusively available in Irish or English only.\n\nIrish has a significant presence in radio. RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta (Gaeltacht radio) has gone beyond its original brief, covering not only the Gaeltacht but also national and international news and issues. It broadcasts across the island of Ireland on FM, although the station and all of its studios are based in the Republic of Ireland. There are also two Irish language-medium community radio stations Raidió na Life in Dublin and Raidió Fáilte in Belfast, the former being an older more recognised important training station for those wishing to work in radio professionally. There is also an internet radio station for young people called Raidió Rí-Rá which is available in some areas on DAB which hopes to receive a national license on FM and there is an internet radio station in Galway Raidió na dTreabh which hopes to receive a community radio license to broadcast across Galway on FM.\n\nAll radio stations in the Republic of Ireland are obliged to have Irish language programming according to the Broadcasting Act 2009. Most commercial radio stations in the Republic have a weekly Irish language programme. RTÉ radio stations have daily Irish language programmes or reports- in most cases carrying Nuacht (News) reports through Irish.\n\nThe other community radio stations in Ireland usually have at least one Irish-language programme per week, depending on the number of employees or volunteers who speak it. Near FM, the community radio station covering north-east Dublin City, broadcasts \"Ar Mhuin na Muice\" five days a week.\n\nBBC Northern Ireland broadcasts an Irish-language service called \"Blas\".\n\nThe Irish-language television station TG4 offers a wide variety of programming, including dramas, rock and pop shows, a technology show, travel shows, documentaries and an award-winning soap opera called \"Ros na Rún\", with around 160,000 viewers per week. TG4 provides their Irish speakers with information while also giving them the opportunity to voice their opinions to the public. In 2015 TG4 reported that overall it has an average share of 2% (650,000 daily viewers) of the national television market in the Republic of Ireland. This market share is up from about 1.5% in the late 1990s. The Ofcom 2014 annual report for Northern Ireland said that TG4 had an average share of 3% of the market in Northern Ireland. TG4 delivers 16 hours a day of television from an annual budget of €34.5 million.\n\nCúla 4 is a children's television service broadcast in the mornings and afternoons on TG4. There is also a stand-alone children's digital television channel available with the same name with the majority of programmes in Irish and with a range of home-produced and foreign dubbed programmes.\n\nRTÉ News Now is a 24-hour digital television news service available featuring national and international news. It broadcasts mostly English language news and current affairs and also broadcasts Nuacht RTÉ the daily RTÉ 1 Irish language news television programme.\n\nThough Irish is the language of a small minority, it has a distinguished modern literature. The foremost prose writer is considered to be Máirtín Ó Cadhain (1906–1970), whose dense and complex work has been compared to that of James Joyce. Two major poets are Seán Ó Ríordáin (1907–1977) and the lyricist and scholar Máire Mhac an tSaoi (b. 1922). There are many less notable figures who have produced work as well.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century the best writers were from the Gaeltacht or closely associated with it. Remarkable autobiographies from this source include \"An tOileánach\" (\"The Islandman\") by Tomás Ó Criomhthain (1856–1937) and \"Fiche Bliain ag Fás\" (\"Twenty Years A'Growing\") by Muiris Ó Súilleabháin (1904–1950).\n\nIrish has also proved to be an excellent vehicle for scholarly work, though chiefly in such areas as Irish language media commentary and analysis; literary criticism and historical studies.\n\nThere are several publishing houses which specialise in Irish-language material and which together produce scores of titles every year.\n\nThe Bible has been available in Irish since the 17th century through the Church of Ireland. In 1964 the first Roman Catholic version was produced at Maynooth under the supervision of Professor Pádraig Ó Fiannachta and was finally published in 1981. The Church of Ireland Book of Common Prayer of 2004 is available in an Irish-language version.\n\nIrish has an online newspaper called \"Tuairisc.ie\" which is funded by Foras na Gaeilge and advertisers. This replaces previous Foras na Gaeilge-funded newspapers which were available both in print and online. The newspapers \"Foinse\" (1996-2013) and \"Gaelscéal\" (2010-2013) ceased publication in 2013. Between 1984 and 2003 there was a Belfast-based Irish language weekly newspaper \"Lá\" which relaunched as \"Lá Nua\" and ran as a daily national newspaper between 2003 and 2008 and had a readership of several thousand. The board of Foras na Gaeilge announced they were ending funding to the newspaper in late 2008 and the newspaper folded soon after.\n\nThe \"Irish News\" has two pages in Irish every day. The \"Irish Times\" has an Irish-language page called \"Bileog\" published on Mondays and they publish several other articles in Irish and some Irish language news in English on their Irish language \"Treibh\" page on their website. The \"Irish Independent\" publishes an Irish language supplement called \"Seachtain\" on Wednesdays and the \"Irish Daily Star\" publish an article in Irish on Saturdays. The immigrants' newspaper \"Metro Éireann\" also has an article in Irish every issue, as do many local papers throughout the country.\n\nSeveral magazines are published in the language. These include the \"flagship\" monthly review \"Comhar\", with an interest in new literature as well as current affairs and \"An tUltach\" a magazine by the Ulster branch of Conradh na Gaeilge. A quarterly magazine An Gael, similar to Comhar, is published in North America. The only culture and lifestyle magazine in Irish directed chiefly to a younger readership is Nós.\n\nThe revival of Irish traditional folk music in the sixties may initially have hindered the creation of contemporary folk and pop music in Irish. Traditional music, though still popular, now shares the stage with modern Irish-language compositions, a change due partly to the influence of Seachtain na Gaeilge. Yearly albums of contemporary song in Irish now appear. However, it should be pointed out that all of these latter songs are translations from the English and not original compositions. The artists have included Mundy, The Frames, The Coronas, The Corrs, The Walls, Paddy Casey, Kíla, Luan Parle, Gemma Hayes, Bell X1 and comedian/rapper Des Bishop. The Irish-language summer college Coláiste Lurgan has made popular video versions in Irish of English-language pop songs.\n\nThere are two Irish-language radio programmes series specialising in popular music that are broadcast on many of the generally English medium commercial radio stations in Ireland, both created by Digital Audio Productions: Top 40 Oifigiúil na hÉireann and Giotaí. Top 40 Oifigiúil na hÉireann (Ireland's Official Top 40) was first broadcast in 2007.\n\nIt has become increasingly common to hear Irish top 40 hits presented in Irish by radio stations normally associated with English: East Coast FM, Flirt FM, Galway Bay FM, LM FM, Midwest Radio, Beat 102 103, Newstalk, Red FM, Spin 1038, Spin South West and Wired FM.\n\nElectric Picnic, a music festival attended by thousands, features DJs from the Dublin-based Irish-language radio station Raidió na Life, as well as celebrities from Irish-language media doing sketches and comedy. Dara Ó Briain and Des Bishop are among the latter, Bishop (an American by origin) having spent a well-publicised year in the Conamara Gaeltacht to learn the language and popularise its use.\n\nThere are 127 Irish-language primary and 29 secondary schools in the Gaeltacht regions, with over 9,000 pupils at primary level and over 3,000 at secondary receiving their education through the medium of Irish. There are also around 1,000 children in Irish language preschools or \"Naíonraí\" in the regions.\n\nIn Gaeltacht areas education has traditionally been through Irish since the foundation of the state in 1922 but some schools are run through English today (in areas where there is not substantial community use of Irish). A certain number of students in the Gaeltacht areas are L1 (first language) Irish speakers, but even in the Gaeltacht areas the language was taught as an L2 (second) language while English was taught as an L1 language from 1922 until 2017. Professor David Little had commented:\n\nIn 2015 Minister for Education and Skills Jan O'Sullivan TD announced that there would be a comprehensive change in the instruction and teaching of Irish in Gaeltacht schools which would include an updated curriculum for students and more resources. In 2016 Taoiseach Enda Kenny launched the State 'Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022' which has come into operation on a phased basis since September 2017. The policy document is the first time the State and Department of Education have recognised the different linguistic needs of Gaeltacht primary and second-level L1 Irish-speaking students. The policy represents a fundamental change in education in the Gaeltacht, while also allowing current schools who teach through English in the regions to opt-out of continuing to be Gaeltacht schools. Since September 2017 new students in the majority of Gaeltacht schools are being taught a new Irish Junior Certificate subject tailored for L1 speakers of Irish. It is expected that a new Irish language Leaving Certificate subject directed at L1 speakers of Irish will come into the same schools in 2020.\n\nThere has been rapid growth in an alternative school system (mostly urban) in which Irish is the language of instruction. Such schools (known as \"Gaelscoileanna\" at primary level) enjoy strong support from elements of the urban professional class, but are also found in disadvantaged areas. Their success is due to limited but effective community support and a professional organisational administrative infrastructure.\nIn 1972, outside the Irish-speaking areas, there were only 11 such schools at primary level and five at secondary level. Now there are 180 Gaelscoileanna at primary level and 31 Gaelcholáistí and 17 Aonaid Ghaeilge (Irish language units) at second level. These schools educate over 50,000 students and there is now at least one in each of the 32 traditional counties of Ireland. There are also over 4,000 children in Irish-medium preschools or \"Naíonraí\" outside the Gaeltacht.\n\nThese schools have a high academic reputation, thanks to committed teachers and parents. Their success has attracted other parents who seek good examination performance at a moderate cost. The result has been termed a system of \"positive social selection,\" with such schools giving exceptional access to tertiary education and commensurate employment. An analysis of \"feeder\" schools (which supply students to tertiary level institutions) has shown that 22% of the Irish-medium schools sent all their students on to tertiary level, compared to 7% of English-medium schools.\n\nSince September 2017 new students in Irish language-medium secondary schools are taught a new L1 Irish language subject for their Junior Certificate which is specially designed for Irish language-medium schools. It is expected that a new L1 Irish language subject for Leaving Certificate students in Irish language-medium schools will be brought in in 2020.\n\nAn Foras Pátrúnachta are the largest patron body of gaelscoileanna in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nThere are 47 Irish-language summer colleges. These supplement the formal curriculum, providing Irish language courses, and giving students the opportunity to be immersed in the language, usually for a period of three weeks. Some courses are college-based but generally make use of host families in Gaeltacht areas under the guidance of a \"bean an tí\" for second level students. Students attend classes, participate in sports, art, drama, music, go to \"céilithe\" and other summer camp activities through the medium of Irish. As with conventional schools, the Department of Education establishes the boundaries for class size and teacher qualifications. Over 25,000 second level students from all over Ireland attend Irish-language summer colleges in the Gaeltacht every Summer. Irish language summer colleges for second level students in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented at national level by CONCOS. There are also shorter courses for adults and third level students in a number of colleges.\n\nThe Irish language is a compulsory subject in government-funded schools in the Republic of Ireland and has been so since the early days of the state. At present the language must be studied throughout secondary school, but students need not sit the examination in the final year. It is taught as a second language (L2) at second level, to native (L1) speakers and learners (L2) alike. English is offered as a first (L1) language only, even to those who speak it as a second language. The curriculum was reorganised in the 1930s by Father Timothy Corcoran SJ of UCD, who could not speak the language himself.\n\nIn recent years the design and implementation of compulsory Irish have been criticised with growing vigour for their ineffectiveness. In March 2007, the Minister for Education, Mary Hanafin, announced that more attention would be given to the spoken language, and that from 2012 the percentage of marks available in the Leaving Certificate Irish exam would increase from 25% to 40% for the oral component. This increased emphasis on the oral component of the Irish examinations is likely to change the way Irish is examined. Despite this, there is still a strong emphasis on the written word at the expense of the spoken, involving analysis of literature and poetry and the writing of lengthy essays and stories in Irish for the (L2) Leaving Certificate examination.\n\nExtra marks of 5–10% marks are awarded to students who take some of their examinations through Irish, though this practice has been questioned by the Irish Equality Authority.\n\nIt is possible to gain an exemption from learning Irish on the grounds of time spent abroad or a learning disability, subject to Circular 12/96 (primary education) and Circular M10/94 (secondary education) issued by the Department of Education and Science. Over half the students granted an exemption from studying Irish for the Leaving Certificate because of a learning difficulty in the three years up to 2010 sat or intended to sit for other European language examinations such as French or German.\n\nThe Royal Irish Academy's 2006 conference on \"Language Policy and Language Planning in Ireland\" found that the study of Irish and other languages in Ireland was declining. It was recommended, therefore, that training and living for a time in a Gaeltacht area should be compulsory for teachers of Irish. No reference was made to the decline of the language in the Gaeltacht itself. The number of second level students doing \"higher level\" Irish for the Irish Leaving Certificate increased from 15,937 in 2012 to 22,400 in 2018.\n\nThe abolition of compulsory Irish for the Leaving Certificate has been a policy advocated twice by Fine Gael, a major Irish party which more recently won power in the 2011 general election as part of a coalition with the Labour Party. This policy was the cause of disapproving comment by many Irish language activists before the election.\n\nIn 2005 Enda Kenny, leader of Fine Gael, called for the language to be made an optional subject in the last two years of secondary school. Kenny, despite being a fluent speaker himself (and a teacher), stated that he believed that compulsory Irish has done the language more harm than good. The point was made again in April 2010 by Fine Gael's education spokesman Brian Hayes, who said that forcing students to learn Irish was not working, and was actually driving young people away from real engagement with the language. The question provoked a public debate, with some expressing resentment of what they saw as the coercion involved in compulsory Irish. According to the incoming Tánaiste Eamon Gilmore from the Labour Party in this book \"Inside the Room\" published in 2015 Enda Kenny tried to persuade him in the government formation negotiations in 2011 for Irish to become optional for the Leaving Certificate but he would not agree to it. No other main parties in Ireland are in favour of Irish becoming optional for the Leaving Certificate and it is questionable if Fine Gael will advocate in favour of the policy again in future manifestos if no other parties whom they may share power with in Government are also in favour of the policy. Fine Gael now places primary emphasis on improved teaching of Irish, with greater emphasis on oral fluency rather than on the rote learning that characterises the current system. \nIn 2014 just over 7,000 students chose not to sit their Irish Leaving Cert exams, down from almost 14,000 in 2009.\n\nIn 2007 the Government abolished the requirement for barristers and solicitors to pass a written Irish language examination before becoming eligible to commence professional training in the Kings Inns or Blackhall Place. A Government spokesman said it was part of a move to abolish requirements which were no longer practical or realistic. The Bar Council and Law Society run compulsory oral Irish language workshops as part of their professional training courses.\n\nThere are third level courses offered in Irish at all universities (UCC, TCD, UCD, DCU, UL, NUIM, NUIG, UU, QUB). Many of these universities also have thriving Irish language departments, such as the NUI constituent universities, UL, UCC, DCU, UCD and TCD.\nThe national Union of Students in Ireland has a full-time Irish language officer. Most universities in the Republic have Irish-language officers elected by the students.\n\nUniversity College Cork (UCC) maintains a unique site where old texts of Irish relevance in several languages, including Irish, are available in a scholarly format for public use.\n\nAs in the Republic, the Irish language is a minority language in Northern Ireland, known in Irish as .\n\nThere are 36 Gaelscoileanna; 2 Gaelcholáistí and 3 Aonaid Ghaeilge in English-medium Post-Primary Schools in Northern Ireland.\n\nAttitudes towards the language in Northern Ireland have traditionally reflected the political differences between its two divided communities. The language has been regarded with suspicion by Unionists, who have associated it with the Roman Catholic-majority Republic, and more recently, with the Republican movement in Northern Ireland itself. Erection of public street signs in Irish were effectively banned under laws by the Parliament of Northern Ireland, which stated that only English could be used. Many republicans in Northern Ireland, including Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams, learned Irish while in prison, a development known as the \"Jailtacht\". Although the language was taught in Catholic secondary schools (especially by the Christian Brothers), it was not taught at all in the controlled sector, which is mostly attended by Protestant pupils. Irish-medium schools, however, known as \"Gaelscoileanna\", were founded in Belfast and Derry and the Gaelscoileanna movement has since expanded to across much of Northern Ireland similar to its expansion in the Republic of Ireland. An Irish-language newspaper called \"Lá\" (later called \"Lá Nua\") produced by The Andersonstown News Group (later called Belfast Media Group) was also established in Belfast in 1984 and ran as a daily newspaper between 2003 and 2008. The paper is no longer produced due to a decision by Foras na Gaeilge to cease funding it in late 2008. BBC Radio Ulster began broadcasting a nightly half-hour programme in Irish in the early 1980s called \"Blas\" (\"taste, accent\") and BBC Northern Ireland also showed its first TV programme in the language in the early 1990s. BBC Northern Ireland now have an Irish Language Department in their headquarters in Belfast.\n\nIn 2006 Raidió Fáilte Northern Ireland's first Irish language community radio station started broadcasting to the Greater Belfast Area and is one of only two Irish language community radio stations on the island of Ireland- the other being Raidió na Life broadcasting in Dublin. In October 2018 the station moved to a state-of-the-art new building on the junction of the Falls Road and the Westlink motorway.\n\nThe \"Ultach Trust\" was established with a view to broadening the appeal of the language among Protestants, although DUP politicians like Sammy Wilson ridiculed it as a \"leprechaun language\".\nUlster Scots, promoted by some loyalists, was, in turn, ridiculed by nationalists and even some Unionists as \"a DIY language for Orangemen\".\n\nIrish received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the Good Friday Agreement's provisions on \"parity of esteem\". A cross-border body known as \"Foras na Gaeilge\" was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic, taking over the functions of the previous Republic-only . The Agreement (and subsequent implementation measures and memoranda) also contained specific provisions regarding the availability of the Irish language television service TG4 signal in Northern Ireland. In 2001, the British government ratified the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect to Irish in Northern Ireland. In March 2005, TG4 began broadcasting from the Divis transmitter near Belfast, as a result of an agreement between the Department of Foreign Affairs in the Republic of Ireland and the UK Northern Ireland Office. Following Digital Switchover for terrestrial television transmissions in both parts of Ireland in 2012, TG4 is now carried on Freeview HD for viewers in Northern Ireland (channel 51) as well as to those households in Border areas that have spillover reception of the ROI Saorview platform (channel 104). TG4 also continues to be available on other TV delivery platforms across Northern Ireland: Sky (channel 163) and Virgin Cable customers in Belfast (channel 877).\nBelfast City Council has designated the Falls Road area (from Milltown Cemetery to Divis Street) as the Gaeltacht Quarter of Belfast, one of the four cultural quarters of the city. There are a growing number of Irish-medium schools throughout Northern Ireland (e.g. see photo above). Forbairt Feirste work with the business sector across Belfast to promote the Irish language in the business sector and have been very successful in Nationalist areas.\n\nIn February 2018 Foras na Gaeilge announced that Belfast and Carn Tóchair in Derry are going to be designated as being two of the first formal \"Líonraí Gaeilge\" (Irish Language Networks) outside the Gaeltacht. The other areas to be designated as the first formal Líonraí Gaeilge are Loughrea, Ennis and Clondalkin.\n\nUnder the St Andrews Agreement, the UK Government committed to introduce an Irish Language Act. Although a consultation document on the matter was published in 2007, the restoration of devolved government by the Northern Ireland Assembly later that year meant that responsibility for language transferred from London to Belfast. In October 2007, the then Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure, Edwin Poots MLA announced to the Assembly that he did not intend to bring forward an Irish language Bill. The debate over a proposed \"Acht na Gaeilge\" or Irish Language Act has been a central bone of contention between Sinn Féin and the DUP since early 2017 in their efforts to reestablish the Northern Ireland Executive. \n\nIrish speakers in Northern Ireland are represented by POBAL who are the umbrella organisation for the Irish language movement in Northern Ireland. POBAL work closely with other Irish language organisations across the island of Ireland. They share the same name with a Republic of Ireland State company but are a separate organisation.\n\nIrish is no longer used as a community language outside Ireland, but has retained a certain status abroad as an academic subject. It is also used as a vehicle of journalism and literature. A small number of activists teach and promote the language in countries to which large numbers of Irish have migrated.\n\nIrish is taught as a degree subject in a number of tertiary institutions in North America and northern Europe, and at the University of Sydney in Australia. The University of Auckland in New Zealand teaches it as an extension course.\n\nThe organisation Coláiste na nGael plays a major part in fostering the Irish language in Britain. North America has several groups and organisations devoted to the language. Among these are Daltaí na Gaeilge and the North American Gaeltacht. In the Antipodes the main body is the Irish Language Association of Australia, based in Melbourne. The websites maintained by these groups are supplemented by a number of sites and blogs maintained by individuals.\n\nIrish-language publications outside Ireland include two online publications: a quarterly American-based journal called \"An Gael\", and a fortnightly newsletter from Australia called \"An Lúibín\".\n\nIn 2009 the Irish government announced funding for third-level institutions abroad who offer or wish to offer Irish language courses. There are thirty such universities where the Irish language is taught to students. Furthermore, scholarships for international studies in the Irish language can be attained by the Fulbright Commission and Ireland Canada University Foundation.\n\nEngland:\n\nScotland:\n\nWales:\n\nAustria:\n\nCzech Republic:\n\nFrance:\n\nGermany:\n\nNetherlands:\n\nNorway:\n\nPoland:\n\nSweden:\n\nRussia:\n\n\nCanada:\n\nUnited States of America:\n\n\n\nChina:\n\nOn St. Patrick's Day 2014 the language learning app Duolingo announced the release of its new Irish language learning course. As of April 2018 the course had been downloaded by 4.27 million users. Data from 2016 showed 53% of learners were from the U.S; 23% were from Ireland; 10% were from the U.K and 5% were from Canada.\n\nIn 2016 Irish President Michael D. Higgins lauded the seven volunteers who worked with Duolingo to produce the curriculum, calling their contribution \"an act of both national and global citizenship.\" President Higgins went on to say that he hoped the impact of the Duolingo project would catch the attention of the rest of the Irish Government and boost its confidence in the success of language revitalization efforts.\n\n"}
{"id": "39635272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39635272", "title": "Sunset Overdrive", "text": "Sunset Overdrive\n\nSunset Overdrive is an action-adventure third-person shooter video game developed by Insomniac Games and published by Microsoft Studios. It was announced at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013, and released worldwide for Xbox One in October 2014 and for Microsoft Windows in November 2018. The game is set in 2027, in a fictional metropolis called Sunset City. The player controls an employee of FizzCo, who has to fight off the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers: humans who have turned into mutants after drinking FizzCo's energy drink beverage. In the dystopian Sunset City the player character can wall-run, use zip-lines, and grind rails to swiftly navigate through it, with a large arsenal of weapons to use. The game also has a cooperative multiplayer mode called \"Chaos Squad\", which tasks players to complete a series of missions with seven players. As the game puts emphasis on momentum, the game does not feature any cover system.\n\nThe development of the game began in 2010 when Insomniac completed \"Resistance 3.\" After the project was green-lit internally, the studio partnered with Microsoft Studios, which helped fund the game and allowed Insomniac to keep the rights to the franchise. Insomniac described the game as a \"celebration of games\", as the team took inspiration from different sources, including \"Prince of Persia\", \"Jet Set Radio\" and \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\", though at its early stage of development the team took inspirations from \"DayZ\" instead. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, but the team depicted it as an \"awesomepocalypse\" that turns the game's initial world depiction into a \"playground\" for players. \"Sunset Overdrive\" is powered by Insomniac's internal engine, previously used in \"Fuse\", one of their previous games.\n\nThe game received generally positive reviews, with praise for its visuals, traversal system, combat system, and humor. However, the game was criticized for the lack of a compelling story or innovative quest design. It received numerous nominations, including Best Xbox Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. The game was supported with multiple downloadable content, including the story-based \"The Mystery of the Mooil Rig\" and \"Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machine\", after the game's release.\n\n\"Sunset Overdrive\" is an action-adventure game set in a third-person perspective. Players navigate a metropolis called Sunset City in the year 2027. This dystopian world has been overrun by mutants called the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers. The player character is a former FizzCo employee, tasked with cleaning up the mess left behind from a party FizzCo had thrown to celebrate the launch of its new energy drink, Overcharge Delirium XT.\n\nAt the start of the game, players can customize the protagonist's gender, body type, hairstyle, and outfit using the character creator. Players may also alter the look of their customized character at any point during the game by approaching a vendor named Callista. After creating their characters, players proceed to the game's open world, which is free for players to explore at any time. A fast travel system is provided allowing players to reach different locations and to navigate the world quickly. The game features a main campaign with story elements and side-missions, which are triggered automatically when players enter certain locations in the city. These quests mainly involve players delivering objects to other non-playable characters and collecting items from the world. Some of these quests have time limits.\n\nThroughout the game, players encounter both human enemies, such as gang members, FizzCo's robots, OD'd humans who have mutated from drinking too much of the energy drink, and several bosses who are more difficult to defeat compared with other ordinary enemies. The game features a variety of weapons for players to use to combat enemies. These include the standard assault rifle AK-FU and the TNTeddy grenade launcher, which fires teddy bears strapped to sticks of dynamite, fireworks and toy helicopters. All weapons eventually run out of ammunition but do not need to be reloaded while being used. Players unlock more weapons by progressing through the story or purchasing them from shops. Weapons can be upgraded and modified by applying \"Amps\", which increases weapons' lethality, efficiency, and strength. The weapons can be leveled up when players earn enough experience points or defeat enough enemies with them.\n\nThe game's combat focuses on velocity, and encourages players to defeat enemies in a fast-paced way. As a result, players can employ different moves including wall running, air-dashing, zip lining, performing parkour, acrobatics, and water traversal. Players use grind rails to deftly navigate city streets, and are able to switch direction instantly at will. The city is also filled with items for players to bounce up into the air. Players may utilize their weapons while performing these movements and slow down time for players to take aim. On-foot, players cannot walk, take cover, or take out enemies silently, but instead must rely on agility to survive as they will be overwhelmed quickly by enemies if they choose to walk on the ground. The game also features a Style Meter. Shown in the head-up display (HUD) of the game, the Meter increases as players perform stylish moves like killing enemies and grinding on-rails without touching the ground. When players are killed, they do not have to wait for the game to load. Players can respawn and return to the world by different methods, such as descending with a rocket or exiting a golden sarcophagus. Insomniac named this system \"Next-Gen Respawning\".\n\nThe game features an eight-player co-operative multiplayer mode called the Chaos Squad, which tasks players to complete a series of missions, as decided by the players themselves. Players defend vats of Overcharge Delirium XT from waves of OD'd at night and stop their progression by setting up fortifications and barriers, in a manner similar to tower defense games. It is inter-connected with the single-player mode allowing players to transfer their story character, with all the weapons and gadgets they have already accumulated, to the mode. Although players work together, players also try to earn more Style points during play than their co-op partners.\n\nOn July 13, 2027, FizzCo releases its new energy drink, OverCharge Delirium XT (also known as OCD), exclusively in Sunset City. In an attempt to sell OCD faster, FizzCo skipped health regulation protocols, leading to the drink being so toxic that anyone who drinks it transforms into a violent, boil-covered mutant known as an Overcharge Drinker (OD). In order to cover up the deception, FizzCo claims that a viral outbreak has happened and quarantines the whole city, preventing anyone from entering or exiting. The player, a FizzCo employee who works in the sanitation division, is saved from an attacking OD by Walter, a fellow survivor; the player is unaffected by the drink, as they were not allowed to attend the launch party for OCD, later referred to as \"Horror Night\".\n\nUpon learning that Walter is creating a plane to escape the quarantine, the player obtains the aid of Sam and the Oxfords, a group of rich but lazy geniuses. After multiple errands, the Oxfords build a propeller to complete the plane. The player joins Walter in his plane to escape the city and reveal the truth about the outbreak. At the last second, Walter notices an invisible wall preventing their escape and pushes the player out of the plane before dying in the subsequent crash.\n\nStill planning to escape, the player aids Troop Bushido, scouts living in a samurai museum, and the Fargarths, a group of larpers. In thanks, the two groups design and build a ship out of garbage which tricks the FizzCo sensors and allow them past. As the player is about to escape, they learn that FizzCo robots are attacking the Oxfords and Troop Bushido in order to kill all witnesses. The player returns to Sunset City and rescues the survivors. Sam informs the player that there is a deadly superweapon in FizzCo headquarters, which the player is able to break into after obtaining the help of Las Catrinas, a trio of skeleton-themed Mexican American cheerleaders caring for the children's ward of a hospital, by recruiting a band fronted by King Buzzo (voiced and mocapped by the real Melvins singer) to perform for the children.\n\nThe player rallies the four factions to attack FizzCo headquarters, and attempts to destroy FizzCo HQ by riding a giant bottle of OCD into it (reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove). The player is killed in the blast, and the factions mourn them. However, the player stops the credits rolling after this scene to complain how depressing the ending is, and decides to change it. The player survives in this ending, and it is revealed that the FizzCo building is a robot that is meant to destroy the city to cover up the OCD outbreak. The player destroys the robot and has milk and crackers with the other survivors. After the credits, however, computers in the FizzCo headquarters automatically activate a protocol sending FizzCo helicopters full of OCD around the world.\n\n\"Sunset Overdrive\" was developed by Insomniac Games, which had mainly developed games for PlayStation consoles. Drew Murray and Marcus Smith, the game's creative directors, began brainstorming \"Sunset Overdrive\" after the completion of \"Resistance 3\" in 2011. They presented their ideas to Insomniac's owners and CEO Ted Price, outlining a project that would borrow influences from the documentary \"Hyena Men of Kenya\", \"Tank Girl\" comics, the novel \"I Am Legend\", the British television series \"The Young Ones\", Halloween masks from the 1960s, and Lego. The initial presentation failed to generate interest, but Murray and Smith were asked to come back a week later to explain how the game would actually be played. In their second presentation, they explained their vision of a game featuring fast-paced action that would be \"the rock and roll end times\". According to Smith this confused some team members who thought that they were making \"Brütal Legend\".\n\nThe team received approval after their second presentation. After \"Sunset Overdrive\" was green-lit internally, Insomniac had to pitch it to a number of publishers. Insomniac wanted to retain brand ownership, causing some firms to opt out of publishing it. Murray and Smith traveled to Microsoft Studios a number of times to pitch the game to them. The main pitch began with the playing of \"Kick Out the Jams\" by MC5, and ended with Murray: \"...on top of a chair, mimicking how the game was going to play, and the last minute heroics.\" Microsoft was eager to work with Insomniac and agreed to fund and publish the game. The team originally did not want to make it a console exclusive, but they were impressed by Microsoft's philosophy toward the development of Xbox One, and the capabilities of Xbox Live features, which allow the initiation of a \"two-way dialogue\" with players.\n\nChoosing a name for the game was the first thing the team did before starting development. They decided on the name \"Sunset Overdrive\" because they felt it was unique, and captured the feeling of the \"grindhouse\" from the 1970s. The project was originally conceived as an open world survival game similar to \"DayZ\". The initial version of the game did not feature the traversal system, nor the unusual weapons included in the final version, and was described as \"grounded\" by Murray. In this version, players were tasked with scavenging resources during daytime, and defending their base at night. This later evolved to become the game's cooperative multiplayer mode. It employed the animation model from Insomniac's previous game, \"Fuse\". The direction of the game changed after the team watched a video based on Gorillaz, and Murray gave up the idea of a realistic survival game. He then asked the team to start prototyping ideas for a game that they thought would work. Some team members came up with the idea of having skateboarding elements in the game, which led the development team to start working and experimenting with a new traversal system. In hindsight, Murray described the shift in focus as an \"organic, evolutionary process\". As the game's development progressed, the team began to draw on elements from other video game franchises such as \"Prince of Persia\", \"Jet Set Radio\", and \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\", and put the emphasis on momentum.\n\nIn 2013, the team had released \"Fuse\", which was a critical and commercial failure. The team now reflected on the reasons for its poor reception, and felt that they should go back to Insomniac's roots — developing unusual titles with vibrant visuals — instead of another dark shooter like \"Fuse\". They also thought that \"Sunset Overdrive\"'s stylization should reflect the personality of the company, and that building a world that has a sense of humor and irreverence was something the team was eager to do. Ted Price, CEO of Insomniac Games, described it as a game Insomniac had wanted to develop for a long time. The game's producer, Bryan Intihar, called it: \"...the game [they've] been meaning to make for 20 years.\" Microsoft supported it and shared the same vision and the idea of creating something new.\n\nAccording to Price, Insomniac wanted to \"break the rules of shooters\". He felt that the last generation of shooters had established a formula of staying behind cover for defense, and leaning out from it to attack. He wanted to change that pattern with \"Sunset Overdrive\" by encouraging players to attack in an aggressive manner and to focus on momentum. To accomplish this, the team developed a city that supported parkour and fast movements. They also hoped that with the introduction of a new generation of video game consoles, they could establish a new standard for the genre which would \"retrain\" shooter fans playing the game.\n\nSmith compared \"Sunset Overdrive\"s gameplay to pinball games, where a player's every movement has consequences, and the on-screen chaos created by players is based on their actions. The game's combat and traversal elements were originally separate from each other, but were later connected as the team began to think that: \"shooting while grinding was fun\". The combination of these aspects led the studio to adjust the game's world design. The team calculated how the city should be designed so that it could support both combat and traversal. As a result, they ensured that the world was built in modular 4x4 blocks, and that no surface featured an angle that was between 26 and 45 degrees. Furthermore, the team considered how long grinds should be, and decided that they should be at least 8 meters in length. The grinds were designed to be longer than usual in enemy-concentrated areas so as to allow additional time for players to consider both combat and traversal options. In order to encourage experimentation, the game features a vertical map-design, in which the difficulty the enemies' players face increases as they move towards higher ground.\n\nInsomniac described the game as \"a celebration of games\", in which the team pushed existing concepts in a new direction. Besides drawing influences from \"Prince of Persia\", \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\" and \"Jet Set Radio\" series of games for the game's traversal system, they drew influences from \"Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure\" for their \"Next-Gen Respawn\" system, \"Scott Pilgrim\" and \"The Omega Man\" for the game's setting, and \"Peggle\" when they were creating the game's weaponry. The game's humor was inspired by Insomniac's own game series \"Ratchet & Clank\" and \"Spyro the Dragon\". There are also references to other pop culture icons such as \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Portal\". Despite that, Smith said that the game would be completely different from \"The Last of Us\".\n\nThe game's character creator function allowed players to create different kinds of combinations in an avatar. The team ensured that there were many customization options, including allowing players to \"dress like a crazy person\". The developers felt that this feature would suit the story, because the game's city enters a state of anarchy, where social norms no longer exist. The team wanted the character creator to feature diversity, so that players could build an avatar based on their own choices. They found the process of introducing diversity challenging. As a result, a system was developed that broke the character creator down into three different categories: mainstream, street (emo and goth), and costume. The team originally added role-playing games-styled stats to the game's costumes, but later decided to scrap that so that players \"would just choose what they thought looked cool.\"\n\nThe game is set in a near-future, post-apocalyptic world. The team wanted to try something different, unwilling to return to a setting that was similar to \"Resistance 3\". Instead of depicting a world with a dark atmosphere and gritty environments, the catastrophe that occurs in the game's story line is referred to as an \"awesomepocalypse” that transforms the user's initial view of the game's world as a \"playground\" for players to explore and do whatever they want – \"emphasizing the fun of free during end times.\" The goal was to make players feel that the post-apocalyptic world in \"Sunset Overdrive\" is fun and limitless, delighting and lively, instead of a place that is dreadful and worrying. To achieve this, vibrant and vivid colors were used to create the game's world and the team hoped that by tweaking the nature of the setting, the game would be \"self-aware, humorous, and fun\". The team also intentionally avoided creating a very serious tone because the final product needed to be entertaining and comparable to games like \"Crazy Taxi\" and \"Jet Grind Radio\", instead of something too serious that looked like an interactive movie. The team emphasized \"fun trumps realism\" and reflected that through the \"Next-gen Respawn\" system, unrealistic weaponry, and the game's visual style.\n\nWhile the game features colorful graphics that appeal to a broad audience, it was intended for a mature audience which is reflected in the game's story, dialogue, and characters' portrayals. The story was designed to be casual, but compelling. The game's setting is inspired by both \"I Am Legend\" and imagining Iggy Pop as the last person surviving in a post-apocalyptic world. The team also wanted to create a satirical story, and explore the theme of anti-corporatism. The punk rock style was implemented in the game because the game's directors thought that it reflected a sense of \"aggression\", which suited the gameplay.\n\nWhen designing the cover art, the team collaborated with the English studio Ilovedust. They wanted it to be easily recognized and stand out from the cover art of other video games in stores. They also wanted it to represent the game's characteristics: \"intensity\", \"fun in the end times\" in a \"dynamic and vibrant world\". There were three different iterations of the cover art, with major changes made to the game's protagonist throughout its development, as the studio struggled with the protagonist's portrayal. Insomniac was ultimately satisfied with Ilovedust's finished art design.\n\nPrice called \"Sunset Overdrive\" the biggest game the studio had worked on. As it was the first open world game developed by Insomniac they had to deploy new design and development skills to produce it. The time and resources needed to develop the game also expanded significantly. While developing the game's world, the team broke it down into 10 to 11 hexes and zones. They are classified into three different types: low resolution zones, shadow zones, and mission zones, and they overlap each other so that they can keep all zones loaded at the same time. Sunset City had three different iterations. In the early stages, it was called Greenlight City, based on Burbank, California. This version of the city featured interior structures that could be explored by players, and existed when the game's core concept revolved around \"scavenge, craft, defend\". This city was replaced with \"Razor City\" when skateboarding, which later became oil slicks and trampolines, was introduced to the game. Razor City was \"Neo-Tokyo\"-styled, but was later replaced by Sunset City which was more organized. While designing the game's artificial intelligence, the team thought that the game's enemies must force players to use the traversal system while simultaneously engaging in combat with them. Because of the game's vertical design, the enemies were designed to adopt the game's vertical map-design. The team also developed a “nav position tracker”, which programmed these enemies to detect the location of players and find an ambush point.\n\nThe game is powered by an internal engine developed previously by Insomniac Games for its game \"Fuse\". The engine of the game was reworked and optimized for the Xbox One. The game runs on 900p at 30 frame rate per second. The game originally ran at a higher definition of 1080p, but it was decided to fix it at 900p so that more actions and enemies can appear on-screen.\n\nDevelopment of the game's music was led by Boris Salchow, who had composed scores for Insomniac's previous games \"\", \"Resistance 2\" and \"Resistance 3\". He collaborated with composers from Microsoft Studios, and Pyramind music studio. The design team wanted the composers to implement eight different styles of music for eight different sections featured in the game. However, this idea was dropped as being confusing and overly-chaotic. The team wanted to achieve a \"high energy vibe\" for this title and the resulting soundtrack features a lot of punk rock and electronic dance music. Fourteen different bands and artists were hired to perform the music often avoiding using musical instruments and writing lyrics for the game instead. The game's soundtrack was also inspired by works from FIDLAR, DZ Deathrays and Ty Segall.\n\nComposers tried to match beats-per-minute to the gameplay and traversal system. The game features a dynamic music system, in which in-game actions are reflected by the music. When there is more on-screen action, or when players perform kills, the music becomes more frantic and exciting to help players further immerse themselves in the game.\n\n\"Sunset Overdrive\" was among one of the first Xbox One exclusives revealed at Microsoft's press conference at E3 2013. The first gameplay details were revealed by gaming magazine \"Edge\" in May 2014. A gameplay demo and a release date announcement happened at E3 2014. Insomniac had worked solely for the PlayStation family for about twenty years, and the announcement of \"Sunset Overdrive\" being an Xbox exclusive led to speculation that the relationship between Sony and Insomniac had ended. Insomniac denied such rumors, saying the company would still be working with other publishers to produce titles and that petitions would not change \"Sunset Overdrive\"'s status as an Xbox exclusive. It was released on October 28, 2014. On November 15, 2018, it was announced that the title would released for both Windows 10 and Steam on November 16, 2018 without the multiplayer component. THQ Nordic published the game's retail version while Microsoft retained its digital publishing rights.\n\nIn addition to the game's standard edition, players can purchase the game's \"Season Pass\", which adds new in-game items, locations, quests, and bosses. There is also a \"Day One Edition\", which includes three different downloadable content items: \"Nothin' but the Hits\" gun, the Hardcore Hammer, and a Fizzie costume. Players who pre-ordered the game from Xbox Live Marketplace also got two additional weapons: the Accordes de la Muerte and the Hangover. A white Xbox One bundle was also released for the game. To promote the game, Insomniac organized a series of shows called the Sunset TV. They provided new information to players regarding the game prior to its release. Microsoft also launched a website called \"Sunset Overdrive: Walter's Workshop\", which is a browser game that allows players to use some of the weapons featured in the game with footage captured in real-life.\n\nA three-hour free trial of the game was available for players to download for a limited time. Once it was launched the game was supported with downloadable content (DLC). Insomniac released multiple packs which add new weapons to the game. A story-based DLC, titled \"The Mystery of the Mooil Rig\", was released on December 23, 2014. Another story DLC, \"Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machine\", was released on April 1, 2015.\n\n\"Sunset Overdrive\" received positive reviews. It received aggregated scores of 83% from GameRankings based on 63 reviews and 81/100 from Metacritic based on 89 reviews.\n\nThe game's tone was praised by reviewers. Daniel Bischoff from Game Revolution praised the game's comedic elements describing them as \"contemporary\". He added that the game is one of the rare few that made him laugh while playing. Sam Prell from Joystiq appreciated the humor, and thought that its quality was boosted by the performance of the voice-actors. His opinion was echoed by Peter Brown from GameSpot, who found the voice acting in the game entertaining and believable. However, Prell considered some humorous moments \"hit-or-miss\". Andrew Reiner from \"Game Informer\" described the game as a \"full circle\", in which Insomniac has incorporated all the elements from their previous game into this one. As a result, he thought that while the story emphasized comedy, it successfully reflected some pressing issues existing in society. Mollie L Patterson from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" appreciated the game's humor, but noted that it would not be able to satisfy every type of player. Arthur Gies from \"Polygon\" described the story as \"gleefully stupid\", and commended the self-aware narrative. Chris Carter from Destructoid praised the jokes featured in the game. However, he disliked the story, which he thought failed to offer motivation for players to complete the game.\n\n\"Sunset Overdrive\"s gameplay was also commended by many reviewers. Prell compared the game favorably to \"Jet Grind Radio\", \"Saints Row The Third\", \"Infamous\", and \"Ratchet & Clank\". He singled out the traversal system, which he thought was fluid and well-executed. He added that the fast travel system was not useful in this game, since players can find a lot of fun by simply traveling between different locations in the game's world. He thought that all of the game's systems intertwined with each other, and ultimately made the game a complete and worthwhile experience. Reiner echoed similar thoughts, and considered getting around \"Sunset City\" fun for players. He added that the traversal system increased the game's replay value. However, he was disappointed by the game's occasionally repetitive mission design. Sliva and Brown shared similar thoughts, with the latter saying that the game featured too many fetch quests. Patterson disliked the game's traversal; he found that the system was frustrating at times. However, he thought that this problem lessened as players unlocked new moves and skills. Gies felt overwhelmed by the traversal options. He added that Insomniac had successfully created a system that was accessible for ordinary players, while creating challenges for those who want to master the system. However, he noted the camera system may not able to track the movement of the character accurately. He further commended the game's world design, and described it as one of the most \"navigationally sophisticated\" worlds he had ever experienced in a game. Bischoff considered the shooting mechanic \"loose\", but thought that the problem was overshadowed by the game's forgiving aiming and steady difficulty curve. Lucas Sullivan also criticized the mechanic, calling it \"inconsistent\".\n\nThe customization options received acclaim. Bischoff praised the arsenal of weapons featured in the game, which he thought was deep, interesting, and creative, benefited by the Amps system, which added additional complexity to them. Prell described it as the \"king\" of the game. He praised the game's ability to allow players to customize their characters, and considered the weapons featured \"varied\", and thought they enhanced the game with personality. Reiner thought that all of the weapons featured in the game were fun to use, and that the amps system made experimenting with different weapons rewarding. Patterson also commended the game's weapons though he was initially skeptical about them. Gies thought that the customization options allowed players to play the game as they preferred, and described the character creator as \"flexible\". Marty Sliva from IGN praised the Amp upgrade system, which he felt encouraged players to try out unusual ways to experiment with it.\n\nThe game's art style was applauded. Bischoff praised the colorful graphics and the different graphical effects featured in the game. He further praised the game's presentation, which he thought would lead \"the Xbox One console’s personality this generation.\" Reiner compared the colorful graphics of the game to \"Sesame Street\", and thought the bright colors \"[electrified] the screen\". Reiner also praised the \"Next-Gen Respawn\" system, and the protagonist's animation. Sliva praised the design of the city, as he thought it featured a unique artistic style, and aided the traversal system. He added that the game's visuals \"pop\", and compared them to the \"Easter Bunny on an acid trip\". Carter praised the variety existing within the game's world, which he considered has prevented the game's world from being repetitive, and made landmarks easily recognizable. Brown thought that the game did not look realistic, but felt this did not stop the game from being one of the best-looking games available for the console. Sullivan also praised the use of colors, which he found was organic and vibrant. \n\nThe game's multiplayer received mixed reviews. Prell thought that the mission-design was varied, and the voting system kept the mode from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and multiplayer, noting that the items that could be carried over from multiplayer to campaign made the mode feel rewarding for players. Reiner thought that the action featured in this mode is satisfying, but thought that the system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players. Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to switch between the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the multiplayer mode a rewarding experience. Brown criticized the mode, saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.\n\nThe game was the second best-selling game in the UK on its release, and was outsold by \"FIFA 15\". In its second week of release, it was the eighth best-selling game.\n\nOn September 13, 2018, Insomniac Games expressed interest in making a sequel to \"Sunset Overdrive\". However, as the rights to the intellectual property is wholly owned by Insomniac, they would need to find a new publishing partner that can support the game's large scope.\n"}

{"id": "7443008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7443008", "title": "Transpersonal anthropology", "text": "Transpersonal anthropology\n\nTranspersonal anthropology is a subdiscipline of cultural anthropology and transpersonal studies. It studies the relationship between altered states of consciousness and culture.\n\nAccording to Walsh and Vaughan, who proposed several definitions of the transpersonal field in the early 1990’s, «Transpersonal anthropology is the cross-cultural study of transpersonal phenomena and the relationship between consciousness and culture.» Charles Laughlin, a founder of the field of Transpersonal anthropology, has defined the discipline as «the cross-cultural study of transpersonal experiences, including the sociocultural evocation, interpretation, and utility of transpersonal experiences, and their involvement in defining social roles».\n\nAs with transpersonal psychology, the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and transpersonal experience. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of myth, ritual, diet, and texts in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.\n\nSheppard has noted how transpersonal anthropology can be said to have begun in the USA in the 1970s. By the mid-eighties the discipline was described as a «young and growing field» by commentators. There was, by this time, also a development at the organizational level, in the form of the \"Association of Transpersonal Anthropology\", with its supporting publication, the \"Phoenix\". According to Hunter, the parallel field of Anthropology of Consciousness grew out of the transpersonal perspective, including Transpersonal anthropology.\n\nCentral to the development of the field has been the work of anthropologist Charles D. Laughlin, who is considered to be one of the primary founders of the discipline. However, Shepard also notes the contributions of Ihsan Al-Issa, and Edith Turner, wife of the anthropologist Victor Turner.\n\nOne of the contributions of Laughlin to anthropological theory is a differentiation between so-called monophasic and polyphasic cultures. According to this theory polyphasic cultures are open to altered states of consciousness, and tries to integrate these experiences into their worldview, while monophasic cultures, typical of technocratical societies, are largely closed to these alternative states of mind. Laughlin has published extensively on the topic of Transpersonal anthropology, and has addresses several issues within the field, including methodology.\n\nThe work of Al-Issa has dealt with the topic of hallucinations, and the cultural aspects of them. Here, Al-Issa notes how not all cultures have negative views on hallucinations. Cross-cultural differences are noted by Al-Issa in sensory modalities most commonly encountered in hallucinations.\n\nThe field also includes the theories of anthropologist Dennis Gaffin whose contribution is a re-conceptualization of fairyology and the fairy-faith within the context of anthropology.\n\nSheppard explains how Edith Turner's interpretations of her husband's field studies among the Ndembu in Zambia also can be interpreted as belonging to transpersonal anthropology, insofar as her interpretations of their healing rituals were transpersonal.\n\nSheppard has published an article criticising transpersonal anthropology, at least as it has typically been practiced in contemporary scholarship. Her criticisms include its lack of a systematic conceptual base; its over-emphasis on shamanism; the difficulty in studying non-Western cultures that have been truly immune to Western influences and the question of the extent to which transpersonal anthropology has really addressed altered states of consciousness.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43675485", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43675485", "title": "Water Tribunal of the plain of Valencia", "text": "Water Tribunal of the plain of Valencia\n\nThe Water Tribunal of the plain of Valencia, also known as the Tribunal of Waters () is an institution of Justice to settle disputes arising from the use of irrigation water by farmers in several Irrigation Communities () and canals (\"Quart\", \"Benàger i Faitanar\", \"Tormos\", \"Mislata\", \"Mestalla\", \"Favara\", \"Rascanya\", \"Rovella\" and \"Xirivella\") in the Horta de València.\n\nIn 2009 it was chosen along with the Council of Wise Men of the plain of Murcia as intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO.\n\nThe Tribunal is a customary court. It consists of one representative, called a trustee, from each of the Irrigation Communities—nine in total—and one among them is elected president for a period of two years. Every Thursday the Tribunal meets in public and an administrative session at the Casa Vestidor at the Plaça de la Mare de Déu of Valencia to discuss various issues, mainly the distribution of water. On public holidays that fall on a Thursday, the Water Court meets on the preceding Wednesday . That is when the bailiff, with the permission of the president, calls for cases from each of the canals in turn, with the traditional phrase \"denunciants de la sèquia de...!\" (\"claimants from the irrigation canal of...!\"). The trial takes place quickly and is completely in Valencian. \n\nEach complainant puts his case before the Tribunal, and then the accused defends himself and answers questions. It is then when the Tribunal, with the exception of the trustee of the canal in question (to ensure fairness) decides the guilt of the defendant, and if so found, it is the trustee of the canal who imposes the penalty for the offender, according to the \"Bylaws of the Irrigation Communities\" (). \nThe court is purely oral—there is nothing done in writing and no records are kept.\n\nThe Tribunal's origin is not fully known, although it is likely to have evolved from previous Andalusian traditions. Some historians such as José Vicente Gómez Bayarri placed its origins in Roman times.\n\nThe most widespread theory, but without any historical basis, is owed to Francisco Javier Borrull. His hypothesis is that there was already a precedent in Roman times, but its foundation as it operates today occurred during the reigns of the Caliphs Abd-ar-Rahman III and Al-Hakam II, specifically in 960. Borrull's reason was that during the reign of these two Caliphs was an era of complete peace on the Iberian peninsula, and therefore it must have been founded then. In fact, the millennial anniversary of the founding of the Water Tribunal took place in 1960, led by Vicente Giner Boira, legal adviser to the Tribunal at the time, and leading proponent of this theory in the twentieth century.\n\n\n"}
