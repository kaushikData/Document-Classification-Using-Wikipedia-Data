{"id": "16093921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16093921", "title": "24 Hours of LeMons", "text": "24 Hours of LeMons\n\nThe 24 Hours of Lemons is a series of endurance races held on paved road race courses across the United States and, since 2016, New Zealand. The series holds the Guinness World Record for the \"Most participants in one race\" (216 cars). \n\nThe title is a parody of the long running annual 24 Hours of Le Mans race, and lemon cars. Teams of 4 or more drivers compete for up to 24 hours in race-prepared cars that cost no more than US$500 for cars in the USA series (NZD$999 in New Zealand) as with folkracing there is a price limit. These races set themselves apart from the typical road race by the unusual penalties and punishments meted out by judges, as well as a blatant disregard for traditional motorsport politicking. The series is similar to the ChumpCar World Series which developed out of it, but retains a more carnival-like atmosphere.\n\nThe event is billed as a 24-hour endurance race. The event covers a weekend, and participants endure \"scrutiny\" and a number of qualifiers along with the main endurance race of varying total hours, depending on the venue (including resource consent/s and Licences). The organizers state that they will attempt to run at least one true 24-hour race (continuous) every year.\n\nThe 24 Hours of LeMons, founded by author/editor Jay Lamm (self appointed \"Chief Perp\"), began in 2006 as a progression of an earlier San Francisco, California event, the Double 500, which was a 500-kilometer road rally for US$500 vehicles. After several yearly Double 500s, the organizers deemed the event too easy, so the 24 Hours of Lemons endurance race was born.\n\nThe earliest LeMons races were held at Altamont Motorsports Park and other tracks in California. The series expanded in 2008 to include events in the eastern United States, with races held in Connecticut, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas in addition to the races in California and Nevada.\n\nIn May 2008, a LeMons race held at Altamont Motorsports Park was struck by tragedy when the driver of one of the cars died during the race. Court Summerfield, 47, suffered a heart attack or stroke during the race and crashed into a wall. Investigations revealed that there were no malfunctions with the car and that the driver was already dead upon impact.\n\nIn September 2016, New Zealand hosted its inaugural Lemons event at Hampton Downs Motorsport Park in Waikato. Race Director Dr. Jacob Simonsen (the \"Chief Lemon squeezer\") established 24 Hours of Lemons as a Nationwide series with 3 events per year and the inclusion of a unique 24 hour \"day/night\" race. In 2018, 24 Hours of Lemons became New Zealand's largest participation motorsport series, with 295 drivers in one event, which was also the country's first ever continuous 24 hour motorsport race.\n\nTo enter the event, participants must find a car where purchasing and prepping the car will not exceed US$500, AUD$999 and NZD$999 respectively.\n\nThe relatively low value of entrant's cars alludes to the name of the race as such a vehicle might be considered a \"lemon\". The event organizers set a complete set of safety rules that typically are on par with other road racing sanctioning bodies, including the Sports Car Club of America, National Auto Sport Association (USA), Australian Auto-sport Alliance, and Motorsport New Zealand. Additions to the rules (both serious and humorous, plus rules to discourage cheating) include:\n\nRequired safety equipment includes:\n\nIn the USA, most events are 14.5 hours long, with sessions on Saturday and Sunday running from six to ten hours long. There is usually one full 24 hour endurance race each year. In Australia and New Zealand, events average 20 hours over the 2 – 3 days.\n\nEach race begins with all cars being released onto the track under a full course yellow flag for lap-timing transponder checks. No passing is permitted under yellow, so all cars operational before the start (over 150 have been known to start) will circulate around the track in single file for up to 20 minutes until the officials are satisfied that the timing and scoring system is working properly. The race officially begins with the green flag being waved at a randomly chosen car.\n\nStandard racing flags are used by corner workers stationed around the track to communicate with drivers. The black flag is used liberally throughout the race to mandate an immediate pit stop for concerns with the driving or with the car. Driving infractions range from any contact with another vehicle or fixed barrier and overly aggressive driving to spinning or driving two wheels off of the track. Car problems that typically result in black flags are, most frequently, obvious safety problems such as any fluid leak, parts hanging off the car, or inoperative lights. Drivers must report to the penalty box immediately after being shown a black flag.\n\nRaces that are split into two days will have a checkered flag at the end of the first day, signifying the end of the racing session. The race is restarted on the next day, normally with the top ten cars being permitted to line up in order with the first-place car getting the green flag.\n\nLemons officials have an idiosyncratic penalty and punishment system where penalties for some infractions are meted out by a device called The Wheel of Misfortune. Various devices may be put onto the car in order to affect car performance; one device used is metal silhouettes of various farm animals welded to the roof by the \"Arc Angel\" to reduce aerodynamic efficiency. Also, any car that flips in the process of the race is slapped with the \"Why Am I Upside-Down?\" penalty: not only is that team disqualified for the current race, but the driver who flipped the car is barred from all other races for the rest of the season. Likewise, drivers and teams might also be forced to undertake physical acts in order to satisfy punishment conditions, such as the Marcel Marceau Memorial \"Mime Your Crime\" penalty, where a driver must put on white face paint and a beret and mime what they did wrong. In addition, penalties are often tailored to address current events or figures where the race is run. Examples of this include the \"Max Mosley S&M Penalty\", the \"Sheriff Joe Arpaio Penalty\" in Arizona (where drivers must don pink underwear, sit in a hot tent and eat stale bologna sandwiches, all punishments the Maricopa County sheriff has inflicted at his prisons), and the \"Mark Sanford 'Cry For Me, Argentina' Memorial Penalty\" at a race in South Carolina, in which a driver must write a lengthy love letter to his Argentine mistress on his car, à la the former governor of that state. All penalties are designed to waste a driver's time, while less aggressive and better drivers continue to race.\n\nThere are four main awards with one given midway through the race. Note that, in the USA, all prize money is typically awarded entirely in nickels (five-cent coins).\n\nThe midway award was aptly named People's Curse. One car was voted People's Curse, for being driven by the biggest jerks of the day as judged by the attending crowd. The offending car was crushed or otherwise destroyed typically by heavy equipment, but when none could be found, an angry mob with wire cutters and wrenches had been used. If there were not enough votes to destroy a car, it may have instead received nasty but non-fatal damage, or it may have been sent to the Penalty Box with a black flag. For 2013 the Curse was removed from the series.\n\nThe counterpoint to the People's Curse, Organizers Choice (originally People's Choice) is awarded to the team that best represents the friendly spirit of the race. A trophy and $500 prize is given.\n\nThe car that completes the most laps net of pre-race \"BS\" penalties is awarded the Win on Laps, and the team receives a trophy. Through 2011, the winner on laps also received a $1500 cash prize, typically in the form of nickels.\n\nThe grand prize (and considered by some to be the \"true\" winner) is the Index of Effluency award, presented to a car considered unlikely to finish the race at all, let alone finish with a respectable number of laps completed. The team that wins the Index of Effluency is given a larger trophy and a cash prize. The prize was $1501 through 2011, and was reduced to $501 beginning in 2012; in each case, the prize is $1 more than the team could win by winning the race or their class. Prizes, trophies and awards vary depending on the territory.\n\nIn the USA, prior to a race, every entry is assigned into a class, A, B, C, or X. The car in each class that completes the most laps net of pre-race \"BS\" penalties (with the exception of the winner on laps, which was previously recognized) is awarded the class win, and the team receives a trophy. Beginning in 2012, the winners of classes A, B, and C each also receive a $500 cash prize, typically in nickels.\n\nSeveral other trophies are given, typically: Most Heroic Fix, I Got Screwed, Grassroots Motorsports Magazine's Most from the Least, Least (or Most) Horrible Yank Tank, and trophies to the fastest cars of the three classes.\n\nOccasionally, Judges' Choice or Dangerous Homemade Technology awards are given.\n\nAt the end of each season, the organizers also recognize a group of Legends of LeMons for especially noteworthy themes, fabrication work, or other contributions to the series. Forty-one teams earned such recognition in 2009, the first year teams were so honored. In 2010, the number of teams earning \"Legend\" status increased to 58, but this time, four were singled out for the exceptional honor of a Unununium Medal, the next twenty were awarded a Ununquadium Medal, while the remaining 34 received a Ununhexium Medal. In 2011, the list of awards was pared down from previous seasons, as nine racers and teams were awarded a Gluon Medal for their feats.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a summer race and season-ending race are planned, but the location and/or date have not been set.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23225955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23225955", "title": "Art valuation", "text": "Art valuation\n\nArt valuation, an art-specific subset of financial valuation, is the process of estimating either the market value of works of art. As such, it is more of a financial rather than an aesthetic concern, however, subjective views of cultural value play a part as well. Art valuation involves comparing data from multiple sources such as art auction houses, private and corporate collectors, curators, art dealer activities, gallerists (gallery owners), experienced consultants, and specialized market analysts to arrive at a value. Art valuation is accomplished not only for collection, investment, divestment, and financing purposes, but as part of estate valuations, for charitable contributions, for tax planning, insurance, and loan collateral purposes. This article deals with the valuation of works of fine art, especially contemporary art, at the top end of the international market, but similar principles apply to the valuation of less expensive art and antiques.\n\nThe source of a work's artistic charisma has long been debated between artists who create and patrons who enable, but the charismatic power of artworks on those who would possess them is historically the initial driver of value. In the 1960s that charismatic power started edging over to accommodate commercialized culture and a new industry of art, when aesthetic value fell from prominence to parity with Pop art and Andy Warhol's idea of business art, a recognition that art has become a business and making money in business is an art. One of many artists to follow Warhol is Jeff Koons, a stockbroker turned artist who also borrowed imagery from popular culture and made millions.\n\nFor collectors, the emotional connection felt toward a work or collection creates subjective personal value. The weight assigned by such a collector to that subjective measure as a portion of a work's overall financial value may be greater than that by an art speculator not sharing the collector's emotional investment, however, non-economic value measures such as \"Do I like it?\" or \"Does it speak to me?\" still have economic effect because such measures can be deciding factors in a purchase.\n\nIn contrast, the Art Dealer's Association of America (ADAA) suggests that the key issues are authenticity, quality, rarity, condition, provenance and value. \n\nArt valuation activity concerns itself with estimating market demand, estimating liquidity capability of lots, works, and artists, the condition and provenance of works, and with valuation trends such as average sale price and mean estimates. As with other markets, the art market uses its own industry-specific terms of art or vocabulary, for example, \"bought-in\", describing the disadvantageous situation occurring when a work or lot at auction is returned to its owner having been passed over, withdrawn or otherwise unsold. Valuing art is also necessary when a piece is to be used as collateral. The art-lending market has expanded to an estimated $15 billion to $19 billion of loans outstanding in the USA.\nThe shift in Asia towards investment in western art is a factor that has allowed art lending companies to launch offices in Asia as western works are often easier to use as collateral.\n\nAs in the housing market, \"comparables\" are used to determine what level of demand similar items have in a current market. The freshness of the comparables is important because the art market is fluid and stale comparables will yield estimates that may have little relation to a work's current value. Subject matter and the medium of a work also affect market demand, as does rarity.\n\nLiquidity in the art market means having artworks in very high demand and being able to sell those works without impediment. Art sales slow in downturns resulting in the market becoming more illiquid. There is a greater degree of liquidity risk facing the art investor than with other financial assets because there is a limited pool of potential buyers, and with artworks not reaching their reserve prices and not being sold, this has an effect on the auction prices. In a divorce action between a couple who sought to divide a $102 million collection between them, the couple decided a sale would prove problematic because selling the entire collection and dividing the profit would saturate the market and drive down prices; in reporting on the case, \"The Seattle Times\" described the case as a study on how people measure the value of art, and which counts for more — pragmatism or sentiment. The newspaper reported that one of the two litigants had a more sentimental view of the value of the works, while the other had a more businesslike view, wanting balance and diversification. The newspaper attempted to calculate the value of the many artworks at issue in the case by determining a per-square-inch price based on each piece's value divided by its dimension, to end up with a per-square-inch price to apply to the amount of wall space the businesslike litigant wanted to cover with the available art. \"The Times\" ultimately concluded that using this formula as between the litigants, John Singer Sargent's \"Dans les Oliviers à Capri\" was valued at $26,666.67 per square inch, that the sentimental litigant received $3,082 of appraised value per square inch while the businesslike litigant received $1,942 per square inch, but could cover more wall space.\n\nTrends for values from the world's top auction houses are compared for study of market direction and how that direction affects given artists and works. Valuations for art sold at the market's top houses usually carry more weight than valuations from less established houses, as most of the top houses have hundreds of years of experience.\n\nLong term economic trends can have a great impact on the valuation of certain types of work. In recent decades the values of historic Russian and Chinese art have greatly benefited from increased wealth in those countries creating new and very rich collectors, as the values of Orientalist and Islamic art had earlier been boosted by oil wealth in the Arab world.\n\nOne of many factors in the primary market's price of a living artist's work is a dealer's contract with an artist: many dealers, as stakeholders in their artists' success, agree to buy their own stable of artists' work at auction in order to prevent price drops, to maintain price stability, or to increase perceived value, or all three, thus dealers bidding on their own artists at auction have a direct impact on the selling price for those artists' works and as a result, the valuation of those works.\n\nResearch data available from art auction houses such as Christie's, Sotheby's, Phillips, Bonhams, and Lyon & Turnbull are those tracking market trends such as yearly lot transactions, bought-in statistics, sales volume, price levels, and pre-auction estimates. There are also companies such as ArtTactic utilizing art auction data as providers of art market research analysis. Information available from internet-based art sale history databases generally does not include the condition of a work, a very important factor, therefore the prices quoted in those databases reflect auction hammer price without other, crucial valuation factors. Additionally, the databases of auctioned work do not cover private sales of works, and thus their use for art valuation is but one source among many needed for determining value.\n\nValuation estimates by auction houses are typically given in ranges of prices to offset uncertainty. Generally, estimates are made by looking at what a comparable piece of art sold for recently, with estimates given in a range of prices rather than one fixed figure, and in the case of contemporary art especially, having few comparables or when an artist is not well known and has no auction history, the risks of incorrect valuation are greatest.\n\nOne potential factor in valuation are the seller's reasons for selling a particular work and/or the buyer's reasons for buying, neither of which may have anything to do with the other. For example, a seller may be motivated by financial need, boredom with a particular artwork, or the desire to raise funds for a different purchase. Common motivations include the so-called three D's: death, debt and divorce. Buyers may be motivated by market excitement, may be acting in accord with a collection plan, or buying like buyers of stock: to drive value up or down either for themselves or for another person. \n\nOne method for pricing pieces by new artists of uncertain value is to ignore aesthetics and consider, besides market trends, three semi-commoditized aspects: \"scale\" - size and level of detail, \"intensity\" - effort, and \"medium\" - quality of the materials.\n\nValuing artworks in such a specialized market, therefore, takes into account a wide variety of factors, some indeed in conflict with each other.\n\nIn the United States, art bought and sold by collectors is treated as a capital asset for tax purposes, and disputes relating to the valuation of art or the nature of gain on its sale are usually decided by the federal Tax Court, and sometimes by other courts applying federal tax law to specific cases.\n\n\n"}

The Hebrew Bible mentions among other episodes that Rehoboam fortified it against Egyptian attack. After the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah the city of Maresha became part of the Edomite kingdom. In the late Persian period a Sidonian community settled in Maresha, and the city is mentioned in the Zenon Papyri (259 BC). During the Maccabean Revolt, Maresha was a base for attacks against Judea and suffered retaliation from the Maccabees. After Hasmonean king, John Hyrcanus I captured and destroyed Maresha in 112 BCE, the region of Idumea remained under Hasmonean control. In 40 BC the Parthians devastated completely the \"strong cite\", after which it was never rebuilt. \n\"Beth Gabra\" or \"Beit Guvrin\" succeeded Maresha as the main town of the area. Conquered by the Roman general Vespasian during the Jewish War (68 CE) and completely destroyed during the Bar Kochba revolt (132–135 CE), it was re-established as a Roman colony and in the year 200 it received the title of a city and the \"ius italicum\", under the new name of \"Eleutheropolis\", 'city of freemen'. Sources from the Byzantine Period mention both Christian and Jewish personalities living in the city.\n\nMaresha was first excavated in 1898-1900 by Bliss and Macalister, who uncovered a planned and fortified Hellenistic city encircled by a town wall with towers. Two Hellenistic and one Israelite stratum were identified by them on the mound. Many of the ancient city's olive presses, columbaria and water cisterns can still be seen.\nBoth Maresha and Beit Guvrin/Eleutheropolis were excavated after 1989 and 1992 respectively by the Israeli archaeologist Amos Kloner. Important finds at the latter site were the amphitheatre built by the Roman army units stationed there, a large Roman bath house, and from the Crusader period a fortress integrating the walls of the Roman amphitheatre and bath house, as well as an attached church.\n\nThe Sidonian burial caves were the family tomb of Apollophanes, the leader of the Sidonian community in Beit Guvrin. The Sidonian caves are the only ones that are painted inside. The caves were burial caves for the Greek, Sidonian and Edumite inhabitants of Beit Guvrin. The first and largest cave has paintings of animals, real and mythic, above the niches where the corpses were laid. A cock crows to scare away demons; the three-headed dog Cerberus guards the entrance to the underworld; a bright red phoenix symbolizes the life after death. The Tomb of the Musicians is decorated with a painting showing a man playing the flute and a woman playing the harp.\n\nThere are about 800 bell-shaped caves located in the area. Many of the caves are linked via an underground network of passageways that connect groups of 40–50 caves. \n\nThe largest bell caves are in the east part of the park. They were dug during the Early Arab Period for chalk to cover roads. The walls are beige-colored limestone. There are numerous bell caves within the park grounds and events are held in one of them. They are large (over high), airy and easily accessible.\n\nSaint Anne's church was first built in the Byzantine period and then rebuilt by the Crusaders in the 12th century. The ruin is known in Arabic as Khirbet (lit. \"ruin\") Sandahanna, the nearby tell (mound) of Maresha being called Tell Sandahanna. The freestanding remains of the apse are well preserved (see photo).\n\nThe remains of a Roman amphitheater were uncovered in the mid-1990s. The amphitheater was built in the 2nd century, on the northwestern outskirts of Beit Guvrin. This amphitheater, in which gladiatorial contests took place, could seat about 3,500 spectators. It had a walled arena of packed earth, with subterranean galleries. The arena was surrounded by a series of connected barrel vaults, which formed a long, circular corridor and supported the stone seats above it; staircases led from the outside and from the circular corridor to the tribunes. It was built for the Roman troops stationed in the region after the suppression of the Bar Kochba rebellion. The amphitheater is an elliptical structure built of large rectangular limestone ashlars. It was in use until destroyed in the Galilee earthquake of 363.\n\nByzantine mosaics depicting birds and animals were discovered on the hilltop in 1924. \n\n"}
{"id": "538415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=538415", "title": "Blackfoot language", "text": "Blackfoot language\n\nThe Blackfoot language, also called Siksiká (ᓱᖽᐧᖿ, its denomination in ISO 639-3), (; ], ), often anglicised as , is an Algonquian language spoken by the Blackfoot or \"Niitsitapi\" people, who currently live in the northwestern plains of North America. There are four dialects, three of which are spoken in Alberta, Canada, and one of which is spoken in the United States: \"Siksiká\" (Blackfoot), to the southeast of Calgary, Alberta; \"Kainai\" (Blood, Many Chiefs), spoken in Alberta between Cardston and Lethbridge; \"Aapátohsipikani\" (Northern Piegan), to the west of Fort MacLeod; and \"Aamsskáápipikani\" (Southern Piegan), in northwestern Montana. The name Blackfoot probably comes from the blackened soles of the leather shoes that the people wore.\n\nThere is a distinct difference between Old Blackfoot (also called High Blackfoot), the dialect spoken by many older speakers, and New Blackfoot (also called Modern Blackfoot), the dialect spoken by younger speakers. Among the Algonquian languages, Blackfoot is relatively divergent in phonology and lexicon. The language has a fairly small phoneme inventory; consisting of 11 basic consonants and three basic vowels that have contrastive length counterparts. Blackfoot is a pitch accent language. Blackfoot language has been declining in the number of native speakers and is classified as either a threatened or endangered language.\n\nLike the other Algonquian languages, Blackfoot is considered to be a polysynthetic language due to its large morpheme inventory and word internal complexity. A majority of Blackfoot morphemes have a one to one correspondence between form and meaning, a defining feature of agglutinative languages. However, Blackfoot does display some fusional characteristics as there are morphemes that are polysemous. Both noun and verb stems cannot be used bare but must be inflected. Due to its morphological complexity, Blackfoot has a flexible word order.\n\nBlackfoot is a member of the Algonquian language belonging to the Plains branch along with Arapaho, Gros Ventre, and Cheyenne. Blackfoot is spoken in Northwestern Montana and throughout Alberta, Canada, making it geographically one of the westernmost Algonquian languages.\n\nOnce, the Blackfoot people were one of a few Native American nations, that inhabited the Great Plains west of the Mississippi river. The people were buffalo hunters, with settlements in the northern United States. Forced to move because of wars with neighboring tribes, the Blackfoot people settled all around the plains area and up into Canada, eventually concentrating in Montana. Blackfoot hunters would track and hunt game, while the remaining people would gather food, and other necessities for the winter. The northern plains, where the Blackfoot settled, had incredibly harsh winters, and the flat land provided little escape from the winds. The Blackfoot Nation thrived, along with many other native groups, until the European settlers arrived in the late eighteenth century. The settlers brought with them horses and technology, but also disease and weapons. Diseases like smallpox, foreign to the natives, decimated the Blackfoot population in the mid-nineteenth century. Groups of Blackfoot people rebelled against the Europeans like Mountain Chief's tribe. But, in 1870, a tribe of peaceful Blackfoot were mistaken for the rebellious tribe and hundreds were slaughtered. Over the next thirty years, the settlers had eradicated the buffalo from the Great Plains. This took away the main element of Blackfoot life and took away the people's ability to be self-sustaining. With their main food source gone, the Blackfoot were forced to rely on government support.\n\nBlackfoot has eighteen consonants, of which all but , , and form pairs distinguished by length.\n\nBlackfoot has a vowel system with three monophthongs, .\n\nThe short monophthongs exhibit allophonic changes as well. The vowels and are raised to and respectively when followed by a long consonant. The vowel /i/ becomes in closed syllables.\n\nThere are three additional diphthongs in Blackfoot. The first diphthong ai is pronounced before a long consonant, (or , in the dialect of the Blackfoot Reserve) before or , and elsewhere is pronounced in the Blood Reserve dialect or in the Blackfoot Reserve dialect. The second diphthong ao is pronounced before and elsewhere. The third diphthong oi may be pronounced [y] before a long consonant and as elsewhere .\n\nLength is contrastive in Blackfoot for both vowels and consonants. Vowel length refers to the duration of a vowel and not a change in quality. The vowel /oo/ is therefore the same sound as /o/ only differing in the length of time over which it is produced.\nConsonants can also be lengthened with the exception of , , and .\n\nBlackfoot is a pitch accent language and it is a contrastive feature in the language. Every word will have at least one high pitched vowel or diphthong but may have more than one. Note that high pitch here is used relative to the contiguous syllables. Blackfoot utterances experience a gradual drop in pitch therefore if an utterance contains a set of accented vowels the first will be higher in pitch than the second but the second will be higher in pitch than the syllables directly surrounding it. Pitch is illustrated in the Latin-based orthography with an acute accent.\n\nBlackfoot is rich with morpho-phonological changes. Below is a limited sample of phonological rules.\n\nGlides are deleted after another consonant, except a glottal stop, or word initially but kept in other conditions.\n\nAccent will spread from an accented vowel to the following vowel across morpheme boundaries.\n\nAt the end of a word, non-high pitched vowels are devoiced, regardless of length.\n\nLexical categories in Blackfoot are a matter of debate in the literature, with the exception of nouns and verbs. Additional proposed categories, proposed by Uhlenbeck, are adjectives, pronouns, adverbs, and particles. Taylor classifies the Blackfoot language as having two major classes, substantives (nouns and pronouns) and verbs, with one minor class consisting of particles. Frantz classifies adjectives and adverbs as affixes but not independent classes.\n\nAgreement morphology is extensive in Blackfoot and agreement morphemes are often polysemous, i.e. animacy and number (nouns) or person and number (verbs) are indicated within the same affix.\n\nAll nouns are required to be inflected for animacy and are classified as either animate or inanimate. Verbs are inflected to match the animacy of its arguments. Animacy in Blackfoot is a grammatical construct for noun classification. Therefore, some semantically inherently inanimate objects, such as drums and knives are grammatically animate.\n\nVerbs are marked with a transitivity marker which must agree with the animacy of its arguments. Even in stories in which a grammatically inanimate object are markedly anthropomorphized, such as talking flowers, speakers will not use animate agreement markers with them.\n\nAll nouns are required to be inflected as either singular or plural. Verbal inflection matches the plurality of its arguments.\n\nBlackfoot has five grammatical persons – first, second, third (proximate), fourth (obviative), and fifth (sub-obviative).\n\nWord order is flexible in Blackfoot. Subjects are not required to precede the verb. Independent noun phrases may be included but these are typically dropped in Blackfoot due to the extensive person inflection on the verb they aren't necessary to interpret the meaning of the utterance. However, if first or second person pronouns are present it yields an emphatic reading. There is an ordering restriction if the Distinct Third Person (DTP) attached pronoun /-aawa/ is used in which the subject independent noun phrase must occur before the verb. If the independent noun phrase occurs after the verb then the DTP may not be used.\n\nBlackfoot nouns must be grammatically particular in order to be a subject of a verb. In transitive constructions the subject must be volitional to be interpreted as subject.\n\nIt has been asserted that Blackfoot, along with other Algonquian languages violates the Universal Person Hierarchy in verb complexes by ranking second person over first person. The hierarchy has traditionally been published as 2nd person > 1st person > 3rd person (proximate) > 4th person (obviative). However, alternative analyses of Blackfoot person hierarchy has been published that suggest the Universal Person Hierarchy is applicable to Blackfoot.\n\nThe Blackfoot verbal template contains a stem with several prefixes and suffixes. The structure of the verb stem in Blackfoot can be roughly broken down into the pre-verb, the root, the medial, and the final. The root and final are required elements.\n\nGenerally, information encoded in the pre-verb can include adverbs, most pronouns, locatives, manners, aspect, mood, and tense. Incorporated objects appear in the medial. The final includes transitivity and animacy markers, and valency markers.\n\nNoun classes are split based on grammatical gender into two categories: animate and inanimate. Additionally, all nouns must be marked for plurality. Plurality agreement are suffixes that attach to noun stems and take four forms, as shown in the table below.\n\nWhen a sentence contains two or more particular animate gender nouns as arguments proximate (major third person/3rd) and obviative (minor third person/4th) markings are used to disambiguate. There may only be one proximate argument in any given sentence but multiple obviates are permissible. Proximate arguments are more prominent in discourse. Redirectional markers, referred to as inverse and direct theme in the literature, can be applied to indicate that the fourth person is the subject argument.\n\nBlackfoot nouns must be grammatically particular, according to Frantz (2009), in order to be a subject of a verb. To be the subject of any verb in Blackfoot the noun must point to a specific referent in the world. In transitive constructions the subject must also be volitional to be interpreted as subject. If subject of a transitive verb is non-specific or non-volitional then verb must be inflected as having an unspecified subject.\n\nThere are four verb categories in Blackfoot: intransitive inanimate, intransitive animate, transitive inanimate, and transitive animate. The parameters of transitivity and animacy for verb selection are typically referred to as stem agreement in order to delineate it from person agreement. The animacy for intransitive verbs is determined by the subject of the verb whereas the transitive verbs are defined by the animacy of their primary object.\n\nThe only required component of a clause in Blackfoot is the verb, referred to as a verbal complex in the Algonquian literature, that must be appropriately inflected according to the standard template: \n\npreverb – root – medial – final\n\nPreverbs are prefixes which encode adverbs, most pronouns, locatives, manners, aspect, mood, and tense. Medials are suffixes which primarily encode manner and incorporated objects. Finals are suffixes which encode transitivity, animacy, and valency. Roots and finals are always required in a verbal complex whereas preverb and medials are not.\n\nWhen there are two animate arguments acting in a transitive animate verb stem one of the arguments must be acting on the other. Which argument is the actor (subject) and which is the acted upon (object) is indicated by the use of direct or inverse theme marking. If a subject argument is higher than the object argument on the person hierarchy then the direct suffix is used. Conversely, when an object outranks the sentences subject then the inverse suffix is used.\n\nBlackfoot voice alterations occur as suffixes on the verb and fall into the category of finals. Finals can include causative, benefactive, reciprocal, and reflexive affixes that either decrease or increase the valency of the stem they are attached too. Below is an example of the reflexive final suffix. It can only be added to a transitive animate stem and results in an animate intranstive stem. This is then interpreted as being a reflexive verb, where the subject of the AI stem is understood to be the both the underlying subject and object of the original verb stem.\n\nRelative clauses are rare in Blackfoot but they do occur. In order to embed a clause you first need to nominalize the clause. The reclassification strategy for nominalization is displayed here followed by a relative clause that uses a nominal formed by this strategy. Reclassification is done by adding nominal inflection to the verb stem instead of person inflection. This derived form then refers to the underlying subject and agrees in both number and animacy.\n\nExamples below show how a reclassifation nominalized clause is used in a relative clause. Note the nominal agreement morphology on the verb matches the subject, singular and plural, respectively.\n\nThe Siksiká, Kainai, and Aapátohsipikani reserves adopted a standardized roman-based orthography in 1975. The Blackfoot alphabet consists of 13 letters.\n\nVowels can be marked with an acute accent or underlined to illustrate pitch accent. Vowels and consonants that are long are written with a double letter (aa = a:).\n\nA syllabics script, ᑯᖾᖹ ᖿᐟᖻ ᓱᖽᐧᖿ \"pikoni kayna siksika,\" was created by Anglican missionary John William Tims around 1888. Although conceptually nearly identical to Western Cree syllabics, the letter forms are innovative. Two series \"(s, y)\" were taken from Cree but given different vowel values; three more \"(p, t, m)\" were changed in consonant values as well, according to the Latin letter they resembled; and the others \"(k, n, w)\" were created from asymmetrical parts of Latin and Greek letters; or in the case of the zero consonant, possibly from the musical notation for quarter note. The Latin orientation of the letters is used for the \"e\" series, after the names of the Latin letters, \"pe, te,\" etc.\n\nThe direction for each vowel is different from Cree, reflecting Latin alphabetic order. The \"e\" orientation is used for the diphthong . Symbols for consonants are taken from the consonant symbol minus the stem, except for diphthongs (\"Ca\" plus for \"Cau\", and \"Ca\" plus for \"Coi\", though there are also cases of writing subphonemic with these finals).\n\nThere are additional finals: allophones and , and three medials: \"ksa\", \"tsa\", \"kya\", \"kwa\".\n\nAlso sometimes it is written in Latin letters but with different spelling on computers because not all computers support the letters used in the Blackfoot language.\n\nIn the late 1900s, many tribes began a surge of revitalization efforts to encourage cultural awareness of indigenous customs and traditions. Of these, the Blackfoot revitalization effort has proven to be quite successful, producing various institutions, including a college dedicated to preserving and promoting Blackfoot traditions. Today, there are head-start programs in primary and secondary schools on the reservation to teach even infants and toddlers about the history of the tribe from an early age.\n\nIn 1987, Dorothy Still Smoking and Darrell Robes Kipp founded the Piegan Institute, a private 501 c 3 non-profit foundation in Montana dedicated to researching, promoting, and preserving the Native American Languages, particularly the Blackfoot language. Piegan Institute founded Nizipuhwahsin (also Nizi Puh Wah Sin or Niitsípuwahsin or Cuts Wood) School in 1995 as a Blackfoot language K–8 immersion school. Since its inception the school has grown and relocated to the center of Browning, Montana in a custom built school house. Recently, some of the school's first graduates have returned to teach the newest generation the Blackfeet language.\n\nBlackfoot Community College (BCC), founded in 1974, is a two-year, nationally accredited college that was made possible by the Indian Education Act of 1972 and the 1964 Act enacted by the Office of Economic Opportunity. BCC is a member of both the American Indian Higher Education Consortium and the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES). It allows teenagers and adults alike to take classes in a wide range of subjects, from classes in Psychology and Digital Photography to classes on Blackfoot language and tradition. They have beginning Blackfoot language classes with labs for members and non-members of the community to learn the language.\n\nIn order to create jobs for the Blackfoot people with real-world applications, the Blackfeet Tribal Business Council launched a company called Chief Mountain Technologies in 2009. This company gives tribal members the opportunity to work in the fields of computer science and business in Browning, Montana on behalf of various government organizations. The establishment of this company in the Blackfoot community allows the people to use their culture and their language in the modern world while maintaining their traditions.\n\nRadio station KBWG in Browning, Montana, broadcasts a one-hour show for Blackfoot language learners four times a week. The Voice of Browning, Thunder Radio, FM 107.5, or \"Ksistsikam ayikinaan\" (literally \"voice from nowhere\") went live in 2010, and focuses on positive programming. In 2011, John Davis, a 21-year-old Blackfeet Community College student explained \"I was the first Blackfeet to ever talk on this radio\", Davis said. \"This is my coup story.\" A story in the Great Falls Tribune noted, \"When the station was replaying programming that originated elsewhere, the radio was all 'tear in my beer' and 'your cheatin' heart.' They called it the suicide station for its depressing old country themes ...\" The station's offerings have now expanded beyond country to include AC/DC and Marvin Gaye, and \"on-the-air jokes they would never hear on a Clear Channel radio station, such as: 'The captain is as cool as commodity cheese.\n\n\"So far we have broadcasting Monday through Friday from around 6:30, Indian time\", quipped station manager Lona Burns, \"to around 11, Indian time.\" ... \"It's Indian radio\", agreed Running Crane. \"Where else can you hear today's hits with traditional music?\"\n\nThe Canadian government has provided support for the languages through funds and other financial resources. According to James Moore, the former Minister of Canadian Heritage and Official Languages, \"the Government of Canada is committed to the revitalization and preservation of Aboriginal languages.\" The funding was put to use in the form of digital libraries containing interviews with native speakers, online courses, and various other resources in the hopes of promoting Blackfoot language and passing it down to subsequent generations. On top of both of these government efforts, the Canadian Government has also provided over $40,000 through the Aboriginal Languages Initiative Fund to promote the use of Aboriginal languages in community and family settings.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9447014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9447014", "title": "Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination", "text": "Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination\n\nThe Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination or BDAE is a neuropsychological battery used to evaluate adults suspected of having aphasia, and is currently in its third edition. It was created by Harold Goodglass and Edith Kaplan. The BDAE evaluates language skills based on perceptual modalities (auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (writing, articulation, and manipulation). Administration time ranges from 20 to 45 minutes for the shortened version but it can last up to 120 minutes for the extended version of the assessment. There are five subtests which include: conversational & expository speech, auditory comprehension, oral expression, reading, and writing. In the extended version all questions are asked while in the shortened version only a few questions are asked within each subtest. Many other tests are sometimes used by neurologists and speech language pathologists on a case-by-case basis, and other comprehensive tests exist like the Western Aphasia Battery.\n\nThe Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) provides a comprehensive exploration of a range of communicative abilities. The results of the BDAE are used to classify patient's language profiles into one of the localization based classifications of aphasia: Broca's, Wernicke's, anomic, conduction, transcortical, transcortical motor, transcortical sensory, and global aphasia syndromes, although the test does not always provide a diagnosis or a therapeutic approach. The assessment does provide you with a severity rating. The Examination is designed to go beyond simple functional definitions of aphasia into the components of language dysfunctions (symptoms) that have been shown to underlie the various aphasic syndromes. Thus, this test evaluates various perceptual modalities (e.g., auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (e.g., comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (e.g., writing, articulation, and manipulation). This approach allows for the neuropsychological analysis and measurement of language-related skills and abilities from both ideographic and nomothetic bases, as well as a comprehensive approach to the symptom configurations that relate to neuropathologic conditions. The test is divided into five subtests and include assessment of conversation and expository speech (simple social responses, free conversation, and picture description), auditory comprehension (at the word-level, sentence level, and complex ideational material), oral expression (automatized sequences, repetition, and naming), reading (basic symbol recognition, number matching, word identification-picture-word matching, oral reading, and reading comprehension), and writing (mechanics, encoding skills, written picture naming, and narrative writing).\n\nThe manual provides clear statements and rules for scoring protocols. Once the scores are collected, the examiner completes the Summary of Scores and inserts them into the Summary Profile of Standard Subtests in the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Record Booklet to get percentiles. The percentiles are listed as 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 only. The scores that are collected are a tally of the number of correct responses, the number of cues given, number of phonemic cues, etc.\n\nReliability of the subtests was studied by selecting protocols of 34 patients with a degree of severity of aphasia ranging from slight to severe. Kuder-Richardson reliability coefficients for subtests ranged from .68 to .98, with about two-thirds of the coefficients reported ranging from .90 upwards. Since test-retest reliability is difficult if not impossible to attain with patients suffering from aphasic symptoms, the current reliability coefficients demonstrate very good internal consistency in terms of what the items within the subtests are measuring.\n\nValidity: A discriminant analysis comparing \"unambiguous exemplars of a single syndrome\" was carried out. Thus, unambiguous cases of Broca’s aphasia, Wernicke’s aphasia, conduction aphasia, and anomic aphasia were selected. Ten variables were selected on the assumption of providing the most useful data. From these, five variables were selected for the discriminant analysis (body part identification, repetition of high probability sentences, verbal paraphasias, articulatory agility rating, and automated sentence rating). This classification yielded no misclassifications.\n\nStandardization of the revised Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination is based on a normative sample of 242 patients with aphasic symptoms tested at the Boston VA Medical Center between 1976-1982. It is important to consider that this sample includes only male, presumably English-speaking patients and is thus highly selected.\n\nIn Depth Review of the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) - Stroke Engine.

The single player mode is a remake of the 2001 game \"Conker's Bad Fur Day\" for the Nintendo 64. However, it includes a new multiplayer mode that is different from the Nintendo 64 version using Xbox Live. Development started the moment the studio was bought by Microsoft in 2002. Recently of 2018, \"Live & Reloaded\" was made backwards-compatible with the Xbox One. It was also added onto the Microsoft Store as a digital copy.\n\nThe Multiplayer in \"Live & Reloaded\" uses the same third-person perspective as the single-player game. Multiplayer consists of different game modes such as Capture the Flag or the standard Deathmatch modes. The player may participate as a member of the SHC or the Tediz. As well as a choice of soldier, the game has a choice of \"classes\" which significantly affect play style.\n\nEach class has its own special equipment, special abilities, and physical capabilities, each being designed for a distinct purpose. They are also designed to have advantages against certain classes while being vulnerable to others. For example, the Thermophile's flamethrower inflicts extreme damage on s and Long Rangers, who have less health, but is virtually useless against the high-vitality Demolisher. Each class comes equipped with a primary weapon with unlimited ammunition (although reloading of the weapon is still required), a limited stock of grenades, and at least one special ability. Each class can also choose from several specialist ordnance items and vehicles unique to the class, which can be obtained at stations in team bases (however, an option is available to the host of a server to disable one or both features). Abilities common to all classes are the ability to shoulder all weapons for extra running speed, and a Spray Can that can be used to apply the player's avatar image to walls to mock human opponents. Scattered throughout the arenas are yellow Upgrade Orbs, which grant a player more equipment and abilities when obtained. A player loses his upgrade orb upon death, allowing another player to obtain it.\n\nTerminals are found in every mission, usually near a base. Terminals are computers that dispense useful items or vehicles, and can be accessed by a player during the game. When accessed, the player is given a menu of the available items. When an item is chosen it can be picked up at an adjacent dispenser area. The objects received from the terminals disappear upon the death of the player that obtained them. Terminals may be neutral and available to both sides, or under the control of one side. Terminals can be attacked and disabled, but not destroyed. If damaged or disabled, they can be repaired with an arc weld, issued to the Demolisher and Sky Jockey classes. Neutral or enemy-controlled terminals can be hacked with a 's hacking device. There are two types of terminals: Specialist Ordinance terminals, and Mobile Units terminals.\n\nThe game was originally titled \"Conker: Live and Uncut\" and was to feature a completely uncensored single player experience. At some point during the development of the game, this was changed and the game was released with some censorship. The censorship included that of some obscenities which were present in the original N64 version. This drew criticism from fans of the original, especially as it detracted from comedic highlights such as the \"Great Mighty Poo\" song in the \"Sloprano\" chapter. This song was also censored on the soundtrack, and Rare once had the uncensored Xbox version of the song on their website.\n\nLike the original, the game was rated M by the ESRB and carried warnings about its content as well as Rare's promotional spoof warnings that advertised the fact that the content of the game was explicitly 'adult'.\n\n\"Conker: Live & Reloaded\" was received positively by critics for its presentation and graphics. The game was named IGN's \"Best of E3 2005\" in the category of \"Best Graphics\" for Xbox. However it was criticized for changes to the singleplayer campaign compared to the original, such as the removal of certain challenges, and the lack of refinement in areas such as facial animation that was perfected on the Nintendo 64. IGN didn't find the new multiplayer to be as fun as the original.\n\nThe multiplayer mode (new in this version of the game) remained popular well into 2007 (over a year and a half since its release) when it remained in the top 10 most played online titles for its platform.\n\n\"Maxim\" gave it a perfect ten and stated that, \"up to 16 people can torch each other. It's more of everything you loved (and decent people protested).\" \"The New York Times\" gave it a favorable review, stating, \"The game is essentially a burlesque of every game featuring cute forest creatures. It has the sort of platform-jumping, rope-climbing, monster-whomping challenges seen in many of these games, but adds foulmouthed animals, scatological humor and gallons of vividly scarlet cartoon blood.\" \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" gave it four stars out of five and said, \"The potty humour will not be to everyone's taste but many films are hilariously lampooned.\" However, Jim Schaefer of \"Detroit Free Press\" gave it three stars out of four and said that he found it \"amusing to relive some of Conker's bawdy behavior, but I wish they would have come up with a new story rather than remaking the old one.\" In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of all four sevens, for a total of 28 out of 40.\n"}

She has a sister, Jene Kearns. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants. She grew up in Rockville Centre, New York. She attended Colby College in Maine, where she was a member of Delta Delta Delta and Phi Beta Kappa, and was graduated \"magna cum laude\" in 1964 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. She was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship in 1964 to pursue doctoral studies. In 1968, she earned a Ph.D. in government from Harvard University, with a thesis titled \"Prayer and Reapportionment: An Analysis of the Relationship between the Congress and the Court.\"\n\nIn 1967, Kearns went to Washington, D.C. as a White House Fellow during the Lyndon B. Johnson administration. Johnson initially expressed interest in hiring the young intern as his Oval Office assistant, but after an article by Kearns appeared in \"The New Republic\" laying out a scenario for Johnson's removal from office over his conduct of the war in Vietnam, she was instead assigned to the Department of Labor; Goodwin has written that she felt relieved to be able to remain in the internship program in any capacity at all. \"The president discovered that I had been actively involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement and had written an article entitled, 'How to Dump Lyndon Johnson'. I thought for sure he would kick me out of the program, but instead he said, 'Oh, bring her down here for a year and if I can't win her over, no one can'.\" After Johnson decided not to run for reelection, he brought Kearns to the White House as a member of his staff, where she focused on domestic anti-poverty efforts.\nAfter Johnson left office in 1969, Kearns taught government at Harvard for 10 years, including a course on the American presidency. During this period, she also assisted Johnson in drafting his memoirs. Her first book \"Lyndon Johnson and the American Dream\", which drew upon her conversations with the late president, was published in 1977, becoming a \"New York Times\" bestseller and provided a launching pad for her literary career.\n\nA sports journalist as well, Goodwin was the first female journalist to enter the Boston Red Sox locker room in 1979. She consulted on and appeared in Ken Burns's 1994 documentary \"Baseball\".\n\nGoodwin won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for History for \"No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front During World War II\" (1994).\n\nGoodwin received an honorary L.H.D. from Bates College in 1998. She was awarded an honorary doctorate from Westfield State College in 2008.\n\nGoodwin was on air talking to Tom Brokaw of NBC News during their 2000 Presidential Election Night Coverage where Brokaw made his announcement that NBC had in fact projected the state of Florida for George W. Bush making him president.\n\nGoodwin won the 2005 Lincoln Prize (for the best book about the American Civil War) for \"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\" (2005), a book about Abraham Lincoln's presidential cabinet. Part of the book was adapted by Tony Kushner into the screenplay for Steven Spielberg's 2012 film \"Lincoln\". She is a member of the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission advisory board. The book also won the inaugural American History Book Prize given by the New-York Historical Society.\nGoodwin was a member of the board of directors for Northwest Airlines.\n\nGoodwin is a frequent guest commentator on \"Meet the Press\", appearing many times (during the tenures of hosts Tim Russert, Tom Brokaw, David Gregory, and Chuck Todd), as well as a regular guest on \"Charlie Rose\", appearing a total of forty-eight times since 1994.\n\nStephen King met with Goodwin while he was writing his novel \"11/22/63\", due to her being an assistant to Johnson, and King used some of her ideas in the novel on what a worst-case scenario would be like if history had changed.\nIn 2014, Kearns won the Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction for \"The Bully Pulpit\". It was also a Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist (History, 2013) and a \"Christian Science Monitor\" 15 best nonfiction (2013).\n\nIn 2016, she appeared as herself in the fifth episode of \"\".\n\nIn 2002, \"The Weekly Standard\" determined that her book \"The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys\" used without attribution numerous phrases and sentences from three other books: \"Times to Remember,\" by Rose Kennedy; \"The Lost Prince,\" by Hank Searl; and \"Kathleen Kennedy: Her Life and Times,\" by Lynne McTaggart. McTaggart remarked, \"If somebody takes a third of somebody's book, which is what happened to me, they are lifting out the heart and guts of somebody else's individual expression.\" Goodwin had previously reached a \"private settlement\" with McTaggart over the issue. In an article she wrote for \"Time\" magazine, she said, \"Though my footnotes repeatedly cited Ms. McTaggart's work, I failed to provide quotation marks for phrases that I had taken verbatim... The larger question for those of us who write history is to understand how citation mistakes can happen.\" In its analysis of the controversy, \"Slate\" magazine criticized Goodwin for the aggrieved tone of her explanation, and suggested Goodwin's worst offense was allowing the plagiarism to remain in future editions of the book even after it was brought to her attention.\n\n\"Slate\" also reported that there were multiple passages in Goodwin's book on the Roosevelts (\"No Ordinary Time\") that were apparently taken from Joseph Lash's \"Eleanor and Franklin\", Hugh Gregory Gallagher's \"FDR's Splendid Deception,\" and other books, although she \"scrupulously\" footnoted the material. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported similar circumstances concerning her book \"The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys\".\n\nThe allegations of plagiarism caused Goodwin to resign from the Pulitzer Prize Board and her position as a regular guest on the \"PBS NewsHour\" program.\n\nIn 1975, Kearns married Richard N. Goodwin, who had worked in the Kennedy and Johnson administrations as an adviser and speechwriter. The two met in mid-1972 at Harvard's Institute of Politics. Richard Goodwin had a son, also named Richard, from a previous marriage, who was nine years old at the time he and Kearns married. Goodwin and Kearns Goodwin, who lived in Concord, Massachusetts, also had two sons together, Michael and Joseph. Her husband died on May 20, 2018, after a brief battle with cancer.\n\nGrowing up in Long Island, Goodwin was a fan of the Brooklyn Dodgers. She noted that her father would have her document the baseball game from the radio and replay the events of the game once he returned home. Goodwin stopped following baseball after the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles in 1957, but later became a Boston Red Sox fan while attending Harvard, and is now a season ticket holder.\n\n"}

The car and rocket are products of Tesla and SpaceX, both companies founded by Elon Musk. The 2008-model Roadster was previously used by Musk for commuting to work, and is now the first production car in space.\n\nThe car, mounted on the rocket's second stage, acquired enough velocity to escape Earth's gravity and enter an elliptical heliocentric orbit crossing the orbit of Mars. The orbit reaches a maximum distance from the Sun at aphelion of . During the early portion of the voyage outside the Earth's atmosphere, live video was transmitted back to the mission control center and live-streamed for slightly over four hours.\n\nAdvertising analysts noted Musk's sense of brand management and use of new media for his decision to launch a Tesla into space. While some commenters voiced concern that the car contributed to space debris, others saw it as a work of art. Musk responded to the critics explaining he wanted to inspire the public about the \"possibility of something new happening in space,\" being part of his larger vision for moving humanity into space.\n\nIn March 2017, SpaceX's founder, Elon Musk, stated that because the launch of the new Falcon Heavy vehicle was risky, it would carry the \"silliest thing we can imagine\". In December 2017, Musk announced that the payload would be his personal Tesla Roadster. Later that month, photos of the car were taken and publicly released prior to payload encapsulation.\n\nOne of the goals of SpaceX for the planned flight was to demonstrate their new rocket could carry a payload as far as the orbit of Mars. The company had offered NASA to carry a scientific payload; NASA did not accept.\n\nFollowing the successful launch, the Roadster became the first road vehicle sent into space. Three special purpose off-road vehicles have previously been sent into space: the lunar rovers of Apollo 15, 16, and 17 in the 1970s; all three were left on the Moon.\n\nThe car was permanently mounted on the rocket in an inclined position above the payload adapter. Tubular structures were added to mount front and side cameras.\n\nPositioned in the driver's seat is \"Starman\", a full-scale human mannequin clad in a SpaceX pressure spacesuit. It was placed with the right hand on the steering wheel and the left elbow resting on the open window sill. The mannequin was named after the David Bowie song \"Starman\" and the car's sound system was set before launch to continuously loop the Bowie song \"Space Oddity\".\n\nThere is a copy of Douglas Adams' 1979 novel \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" in the glovebox, along with references to the book in the form of a towel and a sign on the dashboard that reads \"DON'T PANIC!\". A Hot Wheels miniature Roadster with a miniature Starman is mounted on the dashboard. A plaque bearing the names of the employees who worked on the project is placed underneath the car, and a message on the vehicle's circuit board reads \"Made on Earth by humans\". The car includes a copy of Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" trilogy on a 5D optical disc, a proof of concept for high-density long-lasting data storage donated to Musk by the Arch Mission Foundation.\n\nA license for the launch was issued by the US Office of Commercial Space Transportation on February 2, 2018. The rocket lifted off from Launch Complex 39A at Kennedy Space Center at 15:45 EST (20:45 UTC) on February 6, 2018, and was initially placed in Earth parking orbit while remaining attached to the Falcon Heavy second stage. After a longer-than-usual six-hour coast phase through the Van Allen radiation belts, thereby demonstrating a new capability requested by the U.S. Air Force for direct geostationary orbit (GEO) insertion of heavy intelligence satellites, the second stage reignited for the Earth-escape trajectory.\n\nLike all its previous launches, SpaceX live streamed a video feed. It started at the rocket's launch, and once in space showed the Roadster at different angles from cameras mounted inside and outside the car. This is possible because the Roadster remains attached to the Falcon second stage booster from which camera booms are attached at different angles surrounding the car.\n\nSpaceX did not say how long the feed was to run and Musk had estimated the car's battery would last over 12 hours, but the live stream ran for just over four hours, thus ending before the final boost out of Earth orbit. The images were released by SpaceX into the public domain on its Flickr account.\n\nFollowing the launch, the car and booster were given the Satellite Catalog Number 43205, named \"TESLA ROADSTER/FALCON 9H\", along with the COSPAR designation 2018-017A. The JPL Horizons system publishes solutions for the trajectory as target body \"-143205\".\n\nThe car and booster were launched into a heliocentric orbit that crosses the orbit of Mars and reaches a distance of from the Sun. With an inclination of roughly 1 degree to the ecliptic plane, compared to Mars' 1.85° inclination, the trajectory by design cannot intercept Mars, so the car will not fly by Mars nor enter an orbit around Mars. This was the second object launched by SpaceX to leave Earth orbit (after the DSCOVR mission to Sun–Earth L). By November 4, 2018, the Tesla had travelled to a distance from the Sun which exceeded the orbital distance of Mars, with aphelion at 12:48 UTC on November 9, 2018, at a distance of from the Sun.\n\nEven if the launch had targeted an actual Mars transfer orbit, the booster on which the car is attached lacks the propellant, maneuvering, and communications capabilities required to enter Mars orbit. Launching into this orbit has demonstrated that Falcon Heavy can launch payloads that could reach Mars. The maximum speed of the car relative to the Sun will be close to at perihelion.\n\nThe car in space quickly became a topic for Internet memes. Western Australia Police distributed a picture of a radar gun aimed at the Roadster whilst above Australia. Škoda produced a parody video of a Škoda Superb being driven to Mars (a village in central France). An attempt was made by Donut Media to launch a Hot Wheels-sized Tesla Model X to the stratosphere using a weather balloon.\n\nSome news reports observed a similarity between the real pictures of a car orbiting the Earth and the title sequence of the 1981 animation film \"Heavy Metal\", where a space traveler lands on Earth in a two-seater Chevrolet Corvette convertible.\n\nThe SpaceX launch live stream reached over 2.3 million concurrent viewers on YouTube, which makes it the second most watched live event on the platform , being surpassed only by the Red Bull Stratos jump in 2012.\n\nThe choice of this car as a dummy payload was variously interpreted as a shrewd marketing move for Tesla, a work of art, or a contribution to space debris.\n\nMusk was lauded as a visionary marketer and brand manager by controlling both the timing and the content of his corporate public relations. After the launch, \"Scientific American\" said using a car was not entirely pointless, in the sense that something of that size and weight was necessary for a meaningful test. \"Thematically, it was a perfect fit\" to use the Tesla car, and there was no reason not to take the opportunity to remind the auto industry that Musk was challenging the status quo in that arena, as well as in space. \"Advertising Age\" agreed with \"Business Insider\" that the Roadster space launch was the \"greatest ever car commercial without a dime spent on advertising\", demonstrating that Musk is \"miles ahead of the rest\" in reaching young consumers, where \"mere mortals scrabble about spending millions to fight each other over seconds of air time\", Musk \"just executes his vision.\" Alex Hern, technology reporter for \"The Guardian\", said the choice to launch a car was a \"hybrid of genuine breakthrough and nerd-baiting publicity stunt\" without \"any real point beyond generating good press pics\", which should not detract from the much more important technological milestone represented by the launch of the rocket itself.\n\nLori Garver, a former NASA deputy director, initially said the choice of payload for the Falcon Heavy maiden flight is a gimmick and a loss of opportunity to further advance science—but later clarified that \"I was told by a SpaceX VP (vice president) at the launch that they offered free launches to NASA, Air Force etc. but got no takers.\"\n\nMusk responded to the critics explaining he wanted to inspire the public about the \"possibility of something new happening in space,\" being part of his larger vision for moving humanity into space.\n\nAlice Gorman, a lecturer in archaeology and space studies at Flinders University in Australia, said that its primary purpose is symbolic communication, that \"the red sports car symbolises masculinity – power, wealth and speed – but also how fragile masculinity is.\" Drawing on anthropological theories of symbols, she argues that \"The car is also an armour against dying, a talisman that quells a profound fear of mortality.\" Gorman wrote that \"the spacesuit is also about death. [...] The Starman was never alive, but now he's haunting space.\"\n\n\"The Verge\" likened the Roadster to a \"Readymade\" work of art, such as Marcel Duchamp's 1917 piece \"Fountain\", created by placing an everyday object in an unusual position, context and orientation.\n\nOrbital debris expert Darren McKnight stated that the car poses no risk because it is far from Earth orbit. He added: \"The enthusiasm and interest that [Musk] generates more than offsets the infinitesimally small 'littering' of the cosmos.\" Tommy Sanford, director of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, opined that the car and its rocket stage are no more \"space junk\" than the mundane material usually launched on other test flights. Mass simulators are often deliberately placed in a graveyard orbit or sent on a deep space trajectory, where they are not a hazard. Hugh Lewis, an expert in space debris at the University of Southampton, tweeted \"Intentionally launching a car to a long-lived orbit is not what you want to hear from a company planning to fly 1000s satellites in LEO.\"\n\nThe Planetary Society was concerned that launching a non-sterile object to interplanetary space may risk biological contamination of a foreign world. Scientists at Purdue University thought it was the \"dirtiest\" man-made object ever sent into space, in terms of bacteria amount, noting the car was previously driven on Los Angeles freeways. Although the vehicle will be sterilized by solar radiation over time, some bacteria might survive on pieces of plastic which could contaminate Mars in the distant future.\n\nThe car and second stage were passivated by intentionally removing remaining chemical and electrical energy, at which point the car and rocket booster ceased transmitting telemetry. Based on optical observations made using a robotic telescope at the Warrumbungle Observatory, Dubbo, Australia and refinement of the orbit, a close re-encounter with Earth (originally predicted for 2073) is not possible. In 2020, the car will pass about 6.9 million kilometers (4.3 million miles) from Mars, well outside Mars' gravitational sphere of influence.\n\nThe Virtual Telescope Project observed the Tesla two days after its launch, where it had a magnitude of 15.5, comparable to Pluto's moon Charon. The Roadster was automatically spotted and logged by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope operated by the University of Hawaii. The car was observed by the Deimos Sky Survey (DeSS) at a distance of with a flashing effect suggesting spinning.\n\nThrough measuring changes in apparent brightness of the object, astronomers have determined that the Roadster is rotating with a period of 4.7589 ± 0.0060 minutes (i.e. 4 minutes, 46 seconds). By February 11, 2018, astrometry measurements from 241 independent observations had been collated, refining the positions to within one-tenth of an arcsecond—more accurate than for most observations of objects in space.\n\nSimulations over a 3-million-year timespan found a probability of the Roadster colliding with Earth at approximately 6%, or with Venus at approximately 2.5%. These probabilities of collision are similar to those of other near-Earth objects. The half-life for the tested orbits was calculated as approximately 20 million years, but with trajectories varying significantly following a close approach to the Earth–Moon system in 2091.\n\nMusk had originally speculated that the car could drift in space for a billion years. According to chemist William Carroll, solar radiation, cosmic radiation, and micrometeoroid impacts will structurally damage the car over time. Radiation will eventually break down any material with carbon–carbon bonds, including carbon fiber parts. Tires, paint, plastic and leather might last only about a year, while carbon fiber parts will last considerably longer. Eventually, only the aluminum frame, inert metals, and glass not shattered by meteoroids will remain.\n\n\n\n "}
{"id": "162791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162791", "title": "Evolutionary economics", "text": "Evolutionary economics\n\nEvolutionary economics is part of mainstream economics as well as a heterodox school of economic thought that is inspired by evolutionary biology. Much like mainstream economics, it stresses complex interdependencies, competition, growth, structural change, and resource constraints but differs in the approaches which are used to analyze these phenomena.\n\nEvolutionary economics deals with the study of processes that transform economy for firms, institutions, industries, employment, production, trade and growth within, through the actions of diverse agents from experience and interactions, using evolutionary methodology. Evolutionary economics analyses the unleashing of a process of technological and institutional innovation by generating and testing a diversity of ideas which discover and accumulate more survival value for the costs incurred than competing alternatives. The evidence suggests that it could be adaptive efficiency that defines economic efficiency. Mainstream economic reasoning begins with the postulates of scarcity and rational agents (that is, agents modeled as maximizing their individual welfare), with the \"rational choice\" for any agent being a straightforward exercise in mathematical optimization. There has been renewed interest in treating economic systems as evolutionary systems in the developing field of Complexity economics.\n\nEvolutionary economics does not take the characteristics of either the objects of choice or of the decision-maker as fixed. Rather its focus is on the non-equilibrium \"processes\" that transform the economy \"from within\" and their implications. The processes in turn emerge from actions of diverse agents with bounded rationality who may learn from experience and interactions and whose differences contribute to the change. The subject draws more recently on evolutionary game theory and on the evolutionary methodology of Charles Darwin and the non-equilibrium economics principle of circular and cumulative causation. It is naturalistic in purging earlier notions of economic change as teleological or necessarily improving the human condition.\n\nA different approach is to apply evolutionary psychology principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in rational choice theory. Basic economic concepts such as utility may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Karl Marx presented a schema of stages of historical development, by introducing the notion that human nature was not constant and was not determinative of the nature of the social system; on the contrary, he made it a principle that human behavior was a function of the social and economic system in which it occurred.\n\nMarx based his theory of economic development on the premise of developing economic systems; specifically, over the course of history superior economic systems would replace inferior ones. Inferior systems were beset by internal contradictions and inefficiencies that make them incapable of surviving over the long term. In Marx's scheme, feudalism was replaced by capitalism, which would eventually be superseded by socialism.\n\nAt approximately the same time, Charles Darwin developed a general framework for comprehending any process whereby small, random variations could accumulate and predominate over time into large-scale changes that resulted in the emergence of wholly novel forms (\"speciation\").\n\nThis was followed shortly after by the work of the American pragmatic philosophers (Peirce, James, Dewey) and the founding of two new disciplines, psychology and anthropology, both of which were oriented toward cataloging and developing explanatory frameworks for the variety of behavior patterns (both individual and collective) that were becoming increasingly obvious to all systematic observers. The state of the world converged with the state of the evidence to make almost inevitable the development of a more \"modern\" framework for the analysis of substantive economic issues.\n\nThorstein Veblen (1898) coined the term \"evolutionary economics\" in English. He began his career in the midst of this period of intellectual ferment, and as a young scholar came into direct contact with some of the leading figures of the various movements that were to shape the style and substance of social sciences into the next century and beyond. Veblen saw the need for taking account of cultural variation in his approach; no universal \"human nature\" could possibly be invoked to explain the variety of norms and behaviors that the new science of anthropology showed to be the rule, rather than the exception. He emphasised the conflict between \"industrial\" and \"pecuniary\" or ceremonial values and this Veblenian dichotomy was interpreted in the hands of later writers as the \"ceremonial / instrumental dichotomy\" (Hodgson 2004);\n\nVeblen saw that every culture is materially based and dependent on tools and skills to support the \"life process\", while at the same time, every culture appeared to have a stratified structure of status (\"invidious distinctions\") that ran entirely contrary to the imperatives of the \"instrumental\" (read: \"technological\") aspects of group life. The \"ceremonial\" was related to the past, and conformed to and supported the tribal legends; \"instrumental\" was oriented toward the technological imperative to judge value by the ability to control future consequences. The \"Veblenian dichotomy\" was a specialized variant of the \"instrumental theory of value\" due to John Dewey, with whom Veblen was to make contact briefly at the University of Chicago.\n\nArguably the most important works by Veblen include, but are not restricted to, his most famous works (\"The Theory of the Leisure Class\"; \"The Theory of Business Enterprise\"), but his monograph \"Imperial Germany and the Industrial Revolution\" and the 1898 essay entitled \"Why is Economics not an Evolutionary Science\" have both been influential in shaping the research agenda for subsequent generations of social scientists. TOLC and TOBE together constitute an alternative construction to the neoclassical marginalist theories of consumption and production, respectively.\n\nBoth are founded on his dichotomy, which is at its core a valuational principle. The ceremonial patterns of activity are not bound to any past, but to one that generated a specific set of advantages and prejudices that underlie the current institutions. \"Instrumental\" judgments create benefits according to a new criterion, and therefore are inherently subversive. This line of analysis was more fully and explicitly developed by Clarence E. Ayres of the University of Texas at Austin from the 1920s.\n\nA seminal article by Armen Alchian (1950) argued for adaptive success of firms faced with uncertainty and incomplete information replacing profit maximization as an appropriate modeling assumption. Kenneth Boulding was one of the advocates of the evolutionary methods in social science, as is evident from Kenneth Boulding's Evolutionary Perspective. Kenneth Arrow, Ronald Coase and Douglass North are some of the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel winners who are known for their sympathy to the field.\n\nMore narrowly the works Jack Downie and Edith Penrose offer many insights for those thinking about evolution at the level of the firm in an industry.\n\nJoseph Schumpeter, who lived in the first half of 20th century, was the author of the book \"The Theory of Economic Development\" (1911, transl. 1934). It is important to note that for the word \"development\" he used in his native language, the German word \"Entwicklung\", which can be translated as development or evolution. The translators of the day used the word \"development\" from the French \"développement\", as opposed to \"evolution\" as this was used by Darwin. (Schumpeter, in his later writings in English as a professor at Harvard, used the word \"evolution\".) The current term in common use is economic development.\n\nIn Schumpeter's book he proposed an idea radical for its time: the evolutionary perspective. He based his theory on the assumption of usual macroeconomic equilibrium, which is something like \"the normal mode of economic affairs\". This equilibrium is being perpetually destroyed by entrepreneurs who try to introduce innovations. A successful introduction of an innovation (i.e. a disruptive technology) disturbs the normal flow of economic life, because it forces some of the already existing technologies and means of production to lose their positions within the economy.\n\nOne of the major contributions to the emerging field of evolutionary economics has been the publication of \"An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change\" by Richard Nelson and Sidney G. Winter. These authors have focused mostly on the issue of changes in technology and routines, suggesting a framework for their analysis. If the change occurs constantly in the economy, then some kind of evolutionary process must be in action, and there has been a proposal that this process is Darwinian in nature.\n\nThen, mechanisms that provide selection, generate variation and establish self-replication, must be identified. The authors introduced the term 'steady change' to highlight the evolutionary aspect of economic processes and contrast it with the concept of 'steady state' popular in classical economics. Their approach can be compared and contrasted with the population ecology or organizational ecology approach in sociology: see Douma & Schreuder (2013, chapter 11).\n\nMilton Friedman proposed that markets act as major selection vehicles. As firms compete, unsuccessful rivals fail to capture an appropriate market share, go bankrupt and have to exit. The variety of competing firms is both in their products and practices, that are matched against markets. Both products and practices are determined by routines that firms use: standardized patterns of actions implemented constantly. By imitating these routines, firms propagate them and thus establish inheritance of successful practices.\nA general theory of this process has been proposed by Kurt Dopfer, John Foster and Jason Potts as the micro meso macro framework.\n\nEconomic processes, as part of life processes, are intrinsically evolutionary. From the evolutionary equation that describe life processes, an analytical formula on the main factors of economic processes, such as fixed cost and variable cost, can be derived. The economic return, or competitiveness, of economic entities of different characteristics under different kinds of environment can be calculated. The change of environment causes the change of competitiveness of different economic entities and systems. This is the process of evolution of economic systems.\n\nIn recent years, evolutionary models have been used to assist decision making in applied settings and find solutions to problems such as optimal product design and service portfolio diversification.\n\nA different approach is to apply evolutionary psychology principles to economics which is argued to explain problems such as inconsistencies and biases in rational choice theory. A basic economic concept such as utility may be better viewed as due to preferences that maximized evolutionary fitness in the ancestral environment but not necessarily in the current one. Loss aversion may be explained as being rational when living at subsistence level where a reduction of resources may have meant death and it thus may have been rational to place a greater value on losses than on gains.\n\nPeople are sometimes more cooperative and altruistic than predicted by economic theory which may be explained by mechanisms such as reciprocal altruism and group selection for cooperative behavior. An evolutionary approach may also explain differences between groups such as males being less risk-averse than females since males have more variable reproductive success than females. While unsuccessful risk-seeking may limit reproductive success for both sexes, males may potentially increase their reproductive success much more than females from successful risk-seeking. Frequency-dependent selection may explain why people differ in characteristics such as cooperative behavior with cheating becoming an increasingly less successful strategy as the numbers of cheaters increase.\n\nAnother argument is that humans have a poor intuitive grasp of the economics of the current environment which is very different from the ancestral environment. The ancestral environment likely had relatively little trade, division of labor, and capital goods. Technological change was very slow, wealth differences were much smaller, and possession of many available resources were likely zero-sum games where large inequalities were caused by various forms of exploitation. Humans therefore may have poor intuitive understanding the benefits of free trade (causing calls for protectionism), the value of capital goods (making the labor theory of value appealing), and may intuitively undervalue the benefits of technological development.\n\nThere may be a tendency to see the number of available jobs as a zero-sum game with the total number of jobs being fixed which causes people to not realize that minimum wage laws reduce the number of jobs or to believe that an increased number of jobs in other nations necessarily decreases the number of jobs in their own nation. Large income inequality may easily be viewed as due to exploitation rather than as due to individual differences in productivity. This may easily cause poor economic policies, especially since individual voters have few incentives to make the effort of studying societal economics instead of relying on their intuitions since an individual's vote counts for so little and since politicians may be reluctant to take a stand against intuitive views that are incorrect but widely held.\n\n\n\n"}

Jerzy Lenczowski\"; February 2, 1915 - February 19, 2000) was a lawyer, diplomat, scholar, and Professor of Political Science, Emeritus, at the University of California, Berkeley. Lenczowski was a pioneer in his field as the founder and first chair of the Committee (later Center) of Middle Eastern Studies at Berkeley. He was among America's first major scholars of the modern Middle East.\n\nLenczowski's book, \"American Presidents and the Middle East\", along with \"The Other Arab-Israeli Conflict\" by Steven L. Spiegel and \"Peace Process\" by William B. Quandt, are considered by historian and former Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Oren, as being \"three of the genre's finer examples\", focusing on the post-World War II period and seeking to investigate broader aspects of America's Middle East history.\n\nLenczowski was the father of John Lenczowski, president and founder of the Institute of World Politics.\n\nGeorge Lenczowski was born as Jerzy Lenczowski of Polish parentage, in St. Petersburg, Russia (then known as Petrograd), on February 2, 1915, at a time when the land of his ancestors was still part of neighboring empires. His father worked as an engineer until the Russian Revolution. One of Lenczowski's earliest memories was a perilous escape from the Bolsheviks through war-torn Russia, which brought the Lenczowski family back to what soon would become an independent Poland, following World War I. It was there that Lenczowski received his education from primary school to the faculty of law from the University of Warsaw. He took his LL.M degree in 1936 and continued his studies in France, where he earned a Certificate in Civil Law at the University of Paris (1936) and a Doctorate in Juridical Science in Lille (1937). His dissertation on Contracts in Private and International Law was written in French and published in Paris by Domat-Montchrestien in 1938.\n\nFollowing graduation, Lenczowski entered the Polish Foreign Service as a junior diplomat, and was stationed in the British Mandate of Palestine, acting as consular officer and liaison between the British authorities and Jewish immigrants from Poland. He was witness to the growing numbers of Jews desperate to escape Eastern Europe. \"He was involved in what was a very difficult and delicate process,\" said Lenczowski's son, \"The British were trying to control the immigration and the Arabs didn't want the immigration.\" \n\nWhen Poland was invaded and occupied by Germany and later by the Soviet Union in 1939, Lenczowski's Palestine assignment came to an end. In 1940 he volunteered to serve in the Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade which had moved out from Vichy controlled French Syria to Palestine. He saw action in Egypt and Libya, but most prominently at the siege of Tobruk, and advanced to the rank of second lieutenant. At the end of 1941, however, he was recalled by the Polish Foreign Service to be stationed, as press attaché, at the Polish Embassy in Tehran, Iran. There he was part of the effort to receive, process and assist some two million Poles, who had just been released from Soviet concentration camps upon the intervention of Britain.\n\nIt was there that he met his future wife, Bronia, who herself had been a prisoner of the Soviets; they were wed in March 1943. He was also in Tehran during the 1943 Tehran Conference involving Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. Tragedy struck at this time also, when his parents were arrested by the Germans during the Warsaw uprising and executed in a concentration camp.\n\nWhen the Yalta accord was signed in 1945, the Lenczowskis refused to serve in Stalin's communist government in Poland and sought refuge in the United States. After a year of graduate study at Johns Hopkins University, and occasional work for the Foreign Broadcasting Division of the Department of State, Lenczowski found employment as instructor, and later assistant professor, at Hamilton College in New York State. It was here that he came to the attention of Peter Odegard, one of the pivotal figures of the discipline of political science of the time and chair of the Berkeley department. He became a U.S. citizen in 1951.\n\nUpon Odegard's invitation, Lenczowski came to Berkeley in 1952 as a visiting associate professor; after another year of research and language study in Lebanon, he became a tenured member of the faculty. Lenczowski made his scholarly debut in the United States by publishing \"Russia and the West in Iran\" (1949). He soon followed this with his path-breaking work, \"The Middle East in World Affairs\" (1952). This book was republished, with appropriate revisions, in three later editions and has remained an authoritative text on the politics of the region for over three decades. The fourth edition was reviewed by John C. Campbell in Foreign Affairs in 1980 and states, in part; \"This new edition of a well-known survey is worth noting for the extensive additional material covering 18 years of kaleidoscopic events, and because it remains remarkably comprehensive and reliable both as an introduction to the region and as a reference work.\"\n\nIn Berkeley, Lenczowski was the founder and first chair of the Committee (later Center) of Middle Eastern Studies. Over the years, he served as vice chair and was among the nation's first major scholars of the modern Middle East. As an undergraduate teacher he was respected for his precision and openness; as graduate advisor of his department and mentor of graduate students he raised a generation of scholars who, in tribute, published the volume, \"Ideology and Power in the Middle East: Essays in Honor of George Lenczowski\" (1988). David P. Gardner, then University of California president, spoke in the book's foreword of Lenczowski's \"contributions to a better understanding of the Middle East, and particularly a better understanding of its international relations, its revolutions, and the crucial role of oil.\" Between 1949 and his death, Lenczowski authored six books and monographs, co-authored and co-edited two others, and published nearly 100 scholarly articles on Middle Eastern politics. Lenczowski retired from Berkeley in 1985. His last book, \"American Presidents and the Middle East\", was released in 1990.\n\nGeorge Lenczowski's scholarship is characterized by the accumulation of massive amounts of data, most of which he collected from personal encounters and field trips. He was aided by his fluency in Polish, English, French, German, Russian, Arabic, and Persian. He was a master interviewer and was able to develop unusual rapport with his subjects. \"He knew mid-Eastern heads of state, he knew everyone,\" said Laurence Michalak, vice chairman of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Berkeley, \"He was friendly with the royalty of Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. He was a big, tall man with a Polish accent. He had a very courtly manner. He was very, very polished and very well liked.\" His reputation for objectivity made him welcome everywhere and earned him the respect of U.S. administrations of both political parties. He was a frequent visitor to the White House under both Democratic and Republican administrations. \nLenczowski was invited to serve on the governing boards of numerous learned societies and centers of research. He spoke or lectured at St Antony's College, Oxford, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, the universities of Geneva, Tehran, and Toronto, the American University of Beirut, the Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House), the National War College (Washington, D.C.), the Army War College (Pennsylvania), and Stanford University's Hoover Institution.

{"id": "411091", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=411091", "title": "Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain", "text": "Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain\n\nThe golden age of Jewish culture in Spain coincided with the Middle Ages in Europe, a period of Muslim rule throughout much of the Iberian Peninsula. During intermittent periods of time, Jews were generally accepted in society and Jewish religious, cultural, and economic life blossomed. \n\nThe nature and length of this \"Golden Age\" has been a subject of much debate, as there were at least three Golden Ages interrupted by periods of oppression of all non-Muslims. A few scholars give the start of the Golden Age as 711–718, the Muslim conquest of Iberia. Others date it from 912, during the rule of Abd-ar-Rahman III. The end of the age is variously given as 1031, when the Caliphate of Cordoba ended; 1066, the date of the Granada massacre; 1090, when the Almoravids invaded; or the mid-12th century, when the Almohads invaded.\n\nHaving invaded the areas throughout Southern Spain, and coming to rule in a matter of seven years, Islamic rulers were confronted with many questions relating to the implementation of Islamic Rule on a non-Islamic society. The coexistence of Muslims, Jews, and Christians during this time is revered by many writers. Al-Andalus was a key center of Jewish life during the early Middle Ages, producing important scholars and one of the most stable and wealthy Jewish communities and a relatively educated society for the Muslim occupiers and their Jewish collaborators, as well as some Christians who openly collaborated with the Muslims and Jews. As Sefarad, al-Andalus was the \"capital\" of world Judaism. \n\nMaría Rosa Menocal, a specialist in Iberian literature at Yale University, claims that \"tolerance was an inherent aspect of Andalusian society\". Menocal's 2003 book, \"The Ornament of the World\", argues that the Jewish dhimmis living under the Caliphate, while allowed fewer rights than Muslims, were still better off than in the Christian parts of Europe. Jews from other parts of Europe made their way to \"al-Andalus\", where in parallel to Christian sects regarded as heretical by Catholic Europe, they were not just tolerated, but where opportunities to practise faith and trades were open without restriction save for the prohibitions on proselytisation and, sometimes, on synagogue construction.\n\nBernard Lewis takes issue with this view, calling it ahistorical and exaggerated. He argues that Islam traditionally did not offer equality nor even pretend that it did, arguing that it would have been both a \"theological as well as a logical absurdity.\" However, also Lewis states:\n\nMark Cohen, Professor of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University, in his \"Under Crescent and Cross\", calls the idealized interfaith utopia a \"myth\" that was first promulgated by Jewish historians such as Heinrich Graetz in the 19th century as a rebuke to Christian countries for their treatment of Jews. This myth was met with the \"counter-myth\" of the \"neo-lachrymose conception of Jewish-Arab history\" by Bat Yeor and others, which also \"cannot be maintained in the light of historical reality\".\n\nPrior to 581, the Jews experienced a Golden Age under the Arian Visigoth occupiers of Spain. The Visigoths were mainly indifferent towards Jews and allowed them to grow and prosper. After the Visigoths joined the Catholic Church, they placed ever greater economic burdens on the Jewish population, and later persecuted them severely. It is possible that Jews welcomed the Muslim Arab and mainly Berber conquerors in the 8th century.\n\nA period of tolerance dawned for the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula, whose number was considerably augmented by immigration from North Africa in the wake of the Muslim conquest. North African Jewish immigrants and immigrants from the Middle East bolstered the Jewish population, and made Muslim Spain probably the biggest center of contemporary Jews. Especially after 912, during the reign of Abd-ar-Rahman III and his son, Al-Hakam II, the Jews prospered culturally, and some notable figures held high posts in the Caliphate of Cordoba. Jewish philosophers, mathematicians, astronomers, poets, and rabbinical scholars composed highly rich cultural and scientific work. Many devoted themselves to the study of the sciences and philosophy, composing many of the most valuable texts of Jewish Philosophy. Jews took part in the overall prosperity of Muslim Al-Andalus. Jewish economic expansion was unparalleled. In Toledo after the Christian reconquest in 1085, Jews were involved in translating Arabic texts to the romance languages in the so-called Toledo School of Translators, as they had been previously in translating Greek and Hebrew texts into Arabic. Jews also contributed to botany, geography, medicine, mathematics, poetry and philosophy.\n\n'Abd al-Rahman's court physician and minister was Hasdai ibn Shaprut, the patron of Menahem ben Saruq, Dunash ben Labrat, and other Jewish scholars and poets. In following centuries, Jewish thought flourished under famous figures such as Samuel Ha-Nagid, Moses ibn Ezra, Solomon ibn Gabirol and Judah Halevi. During 'Abd al-Rahman's term of power, the scholar Moses ben Enoch was appointed rabbi of Córdoba, and as a consequence al-Andalus became the center of Talmudic study, and Córdoba the meeting-place of Jewish savants.\n\nThis was a time of partial Jewish autonomy. As \"dhimmis\", or \"protected non-Muslims\", Jews in the Islamic world paid the jizya, which was administered separately from the zakat paid by Muslims. The jizya has been viewed variously as a head tax, as payment for non-conscription in the military (as non-Muslims were normally prohibited from bearing arms or receiving martial training), or as a tribute. Jews had their own legal system and social services. Monotheist religions of the people of the book were tolerated but conspicuous displays of faith, such as bells and processions, were discouraged.\n\nComparing the treatment of Jews in the medieval Islamic world and medieval Christian Europe, the Jews were far more integrated in the political and economic life of Islamic society, and usually faced far less violence from Muslims, though there were some instances of persecution in the Islamic world as well from the 11th century. The Islamic world classified Jews (and Christians) as \"dhimmi\" and allowed them to practice their religion more freely than they could do in Christian Europe.\n\nOther authors criticize the modern notion of Al-Andalus being a tolerant society of equal opportunities for all religious groups as a \"myth\". Jews were living in an uneasy coexistence with Muslims and Catholics, and the relationship between these groups was more often than not marked by segregation and mutual hostility. In the 1066 Granada massacre of much of the Jewish population of the city, the Jewish death toll was higher than in the much publicized Christian pogromes in the Rhineland slightly later. The notable Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides (1135–1204) was forced to flee from Al-Andalus to avoid conversion by the Almohads. In Letter to Yemen, Maimonides wrote:\n\nWith the death of Al-Hakam II in 976, the Caliphate began to dissolve, and the position of the Jews became more precarious under the various smaller kingdoms. The first major persecution was the 1066 Granada massacre, which occurred on 30 December, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in Granada, crucified Jewish vizier Joseph ibn Naghrela and massacred many of the Jewish population of the city. According to one source, \"more than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day.\" This was the first persecution of Jews on the Peninsula under Islamic rule.\nBeginning in 1090, the situation deteriorated further with the invasion of the Almoravids, a puritan Muslim sect from Morocco. Even under the Almoravids, some Jews prospered (although far more so under Ali III, than under his father Yusuf ibn Tashfin). Among those who held the title of \"vizier\" or \"nasi\" in Almoravid times were the poet and physician Abu Ayyub Solomon ibn al-Mu'allam, Abraham ibn Meïr ibn Kamnial, Abu Isaac ibn Muhajar, and Solomon ibn Farusal. The Almoravids were ousted from the peninsula in 1148; however, the region was again invaded, this time by the even more puritanical Almohades.\n\nDuring the reign of these Berber dynasties, many Jewish and even Muslim scholars left the Muslim-controlled portion of Iberia for the city of Toledo, which had been reconquered in 1085 by Christian forces.\n\nThe major Jewish presence in Iberia continued until the Jews were forced to leave or to convert to Christianity in the Alhambra decree of 1492 and a similar decree by Portugal in 1496.\n\n\n\n"}

It has a national collection of 400,000 objects and was founded in 1920. 35% of the main collection is made up of archaeology related items, 8% of the collection is made up of Ethnography related items, Numismatics related items make up 45%, and 12% of the collection is made up of documents. It is regarded as Armenia's national museum and is located on Republic Square in Yerevan. The state financially supports the museum and owns both the collection and the building. The museum carries out conservation and restoration work and publishes works on Armenian architecture, archaeology, ethnography, and history. They also have published a series of reports on archaeological excavations since 1948. The museum carries out educational and scientific programs on Armenian history and culture as well.\n\nOn 9 September 1919, the National Assembly of Armenia founded the History Museum of Armenia. The museum opened to visitors on August 20, 1921. Its first director was Yervand Lalayan.\nOriginally named the Ethnographic-Anthropological Museum-Library, it has been renamed several times, first to the State Central Museum of Armenia (1926), then to the Historical Museum (1935), even later to the State History Museum of Armenia (1962), more recently to the Cultural-Historical Museum (2000), and finally to the History Museum of Armenia (since 2003). \nThe History Museum of Armenia was formed using the collections of the Armenian Ethnographical Association of the Caucasus, the Nor Nakhijevan Museum of Armenian Antiquities, the Museum of Antiquities of Ani, and the Vagharshapat Repository of Ancient Manuscripts. The original collection numbered 15,289 objects.\n\nIn 1935, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia, established separate museums. These museums received items that originally were part of the History Museum of Armenia:\n\nThe History Museum of Armenia continually replenishes its collections with finds from current excavations made at ancient Armenian sites by the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography and the National Academy of Sciences of Armenia. Other objects are obtained through purchases and donations. The museum represents an integral picture of the history and culture of Armenia, from prehistory to the present day. The museum also presents rare traces of cultural interrelations between ancient eastern societies in the Armenian Highlands. These ancient societies include Caucasus, Crete, Egypt, Mitanni, the Hittite Kingdom, Assyria, Iran, the Seleucid Empire, the Roman Empire, and the Byzantine Empire.\n\n\n\n\nThe History Museum of Armenia has held exhibitions in Bochum in 1995, at the Bibliothèque nationale de France in Paris in 1996, in Musee Dobree Nantes in 1996, in Lyon in 1997, in Cairo in 1997, at the Zappeion Megaron of Athens in 1998, in Bonn, in Halle-Wittenberg in 1998, in Peking in 1998, at the Vatican Library in 1999, in Paris in 2000, at the British Library in London in 2001, in Rijksmuseum, in Leiden, in the Netherlands in 2001-2002, and in Budapest in 2002.\n\nThe museum has participated in various international exhibitions including ones in Budapest in 1968, in Paris in 1970, in Leningrad in 1974, in Spokane in 1975, in Los Angeles in 1977, in Tartu in 1979, in Kiev in 1980, in Tsukuba in 1984, in Venice in 1987, at the Pavillon des Arts in Paris in 1999, at the Louvre in Paris in 2007, in New York from 2008 to 2009, in Thessaloniki in 2009, at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg in 2009, at the Princeton University Art Museum in 2010, and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York from 2014 to 2015.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27837170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27837170", "title": "History of natural language processing", "text": "History of natural language processing\n\nThe history of natural language processing describes the advances of natural language processing (Outline of natural language processing). There is some overlap with the history of machine translation and the history of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe history of machine translation dates back to the seventeenth century, when philosophers such as Leibniz and Descartes put forward proposals for codes which would relate words between languages. All of these proposals remained theoretical, and none resulted in the development of an actual machine.\n\nThe first patents for \"translating machines\" were applied for in the mid-1930s. One proposal, by Georges Artsrouni was simply an automatic bilingual dictionary using paper tape. The other proposal, by Peter Troyanskii, a Russian, was more detailed. It included both the bilingual dictionary, and a method for dealing with grammatical roles between languages, based on Esperanto. \n\nIn 1950, Alan Turing published his famous article \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence. This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in a real-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably — on the basis of the conversational content alone — between the program and a real human.\n\nIn 1957, Noam Chomsky’s Syntactic Structures revolutionized Linguistics with 'universal grammar', a rule based system of syntactic structures.\n\nThe Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English. The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem. However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten years long research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced. Little further research in machine translation was conducted until the late 1980s, when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.\n\nSome notably successful NLP systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted \"blocks worlds\" with restricted vocabularies.\n\nIn 1969 Roger Schank introduced the conceptual dependency theory for natural language understanding. This model, partially influenced by the work of Sydney Lamb, was extensively used by Schank's students at Yale University, such as Robert Wilensky, Wendy Lehnert, and Janet Kolodner.\n\nIn 1970, William A. Woods introduced the augmented transition network (ATN) to represent natural language input. Instead of \"phrase structure rules\" ATNs used an equivalent set of finite state automata that were called recursively. ATNs and their more general format called \"generalized ATNs\" continued to be used for a number of years.During the 70's many programmers began to write 'conceptual ontologies', which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data. Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981). During this time, many chatterbots were written including PARRY, Racter, and Jabberwacky.\nUp to the 1980s, most NLP systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules. Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in NLP with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing. This was due both to the steady increase in computational power resulting from Moore's Law and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g. transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing. Some of the earliest-used machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees, produced systems of hard if-then rules similar to existing hand-written rules. Increasingly, however, research has focused on statistical models, which make soft, probabilistic decisions based on attaching real-valued weights to the features making up the input data. The cache language models upon which many speech recognition systems now rely are examples of such statistical models. Such models are generally more robust when given unfamiliar input, especially input that contains errors (as is very common for real-world data), and produce more reliable results when integrated into a larger system comprising multiple subtasks.\n\nMany of the notable early successes occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, where successively more complicated statistical models were developed. These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government. However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems. As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.\n\nRecent research has increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Such algorithms are able to learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers, or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data. Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data. However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the inferior results.\n"}
{"id": "1970438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1970438", "title": "Ian Hancock", "text": "Ian Hancock\n\nIan Hancock (Romani: Yanko le Redžosko, born 29 August 1942) is a linguist, Romani scholar and political advocate. He was born and raised in England and is one of the main contributors in the field of Romani studies.\n\nHe is director of the Program of Romani Studies and the Romani Archives and Documentation Center at The University of Texas at Austin, where he has been a professor of English, linguistics and Asian studies since 1972. He has represented the Romani people at the United Nations and served as a member of the US Holocaust Memorial Council under President Bill Clinton, who, Hancock claims, has Romani ancestry. He also represented the Romani people at the 1997 Rafto Prize award.\n\nHancock was born in London in 1942. His mother, Kitty, is Romanichal; his father, Reginald (Redžo), was part Romungro, the descendant of a Hungarian speaker of North Central Romani named Imre Benczi. He acquired the surname Hancock by Imre's daughter, Maria, who married a member of an English West Country showman family of that name.\n\nIn the late 1960s, he became a Romani rights activist after reading reports about anti-Romani discrimination in Britain. In particular, he took up the cause of Romani rights after reading about an incident in which Romani children left unattended by their parents, who had been arrested, had started a fire by knocking over a paraffin lamp. In 1971, he graduated with a Ph.D. in linguistics.\n\nHancock has published more than 300 books and articles on the Romani people and language (particularly the Vlax dialect). These works analyse the Romani people through not only Romani linguistics but also history, anthropology, and genetics. He has also appeared in the documentary \"American Gypsy.\" He is currently writing a book called \"On Romani Origins and Identity\".\n\nHancock supports some of Ralph Lilley Turner's views on Romani history based on the Romani language. In particular, Hancock agrees that the Dom left India much earlier than the Romani people ie before 1000 AD. In fact, he claims that the Indian musicians mentioned in the \"Shah-Nameh\" and the \"atsingani\" mentioned in \"The Life of St. George the Anchorite\", both of which were previously believed to be ancestors of the Romani people, may have been the ancestors of the Domari people but not of the Romani people. He considers it possible that the Lom split off from the Romani people on reaching Armenia.\n\nContrary to the popular view that the Romani people are descended from low-caste Indians who brought their occupations to Europe, he argues that the Romani people are descended from Indian prisoners of war of Mahmud of Ghazni. As evidence, he points to the presence of Indic words specifically of military origin and to a Banjara oral legend telling of Rajputs who left India through the Himalayas during the Ghaznavid invasions and never returned.\n\nHe also believes that the Romani language originates in a koine language, which he calls \"Rajputic,\" between the many Indian languages spoken by the prisoners of war. He finds it thus similar to several other Indian languages, especially Hindustani.\n\nAs for Romani history, he points out a \"Pariah syndrome\" throughout time and space, culminating in the attempted genocide at the hands of Nazi authorities that was simultaneous to that of the Jews and part of the same \"Final Solution of the Jewish and Gypsy Problem\" project.\n\nHancock is as well known in the field of linguistics, particularly in the area of pidgin and creole languages, as he is in the world of Romani studies and Romani social activism. In addition to his research on the Krio language of Sierra Leone, he has studied the Gullah language, of coastal South Carolina and Georgia, and the Afro-Seminole Creole language, spoken by a community of Black Seminole descendants in Brackettville, Texas. Hancock was the first scholar to report Afro-Seminole Creole. He later identified another variety of that language spoken among Black Seminole descendants in the village of in the Mexican state of Coahuila, where their ancestors had settled in 1850. He maintains that Afro-Seminole Creole and Gullah are closely related languages, as Black Seminoles were descended primarily from Gullah people of the Low Country of South Carolina and Georgia.\n\nHancock is recognised as one of the founders of the field of pidgin and creole linguistics. He has also done extensive research on the English-based creole languages spoken in West Africa and the West Indies. He is known especially for his views on the historical development of these languages. He maintains that all the English-based pidgins and creoles spoken in the Atlantic basin region, both in West Africa and in the Caribbean, belong to a single language family, which he calls the \"English-based Atlantic Creoles.\" He argues that all of them can be traced back to what he calls Guinea Coast Creole English, which arose along the West African Coast in the 17th and 18th centuries, as a language of commerce in the Atlantic slave trade. He says that Guinea Coast Creole English was spoken in coastal slave trading bases such as James Island, Bunce Island, and Elmina Castle, where the offspring of British slave traders and their African wives used it as their native language.\n\nHancock says that Guinea Coast Creole English ultimately gave rise to the pidgin and creole languages spoken in West Africa today, such as the Aku language in the Gambia, Sierra Leone Krio, Nigerian Pidgin English and Cameroonian Pidgin English. He also maintains that some of the Africans taken as slaves to the New World already spoke Guinea Coast Creole English in Africa. Their creole speech influenced the development of creole languages spoken today on the American side of the Atlantic, such as Gullah, Afro-Seminole Creole, Bahamian Dialect, Jamaican Creole, Belizean Kriol, Guyanese Creole, and Sranan Tongo in Suriname.\n\nHancock's views on the connections among the Atlantic creole languages is controversial. The strong similarities among these languages are undeniable, but many linguists prefer to explain the similarities by convergence rather than historical relationships. Other scholars argue that both factors played a role in the formation of the languages. Another group of linguists subscribes to a theory that attributes creole similarities (which extend to Indian Ocean creoles and Hawaiian Creole) to an innate \"bioprogram\" for language that emerges under the conditions common to most creole communities.\n\n"}
{"id": "14936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14936", "title": "Individualist anarchism", "text": "Individualist anarchism\n\nIndividualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the individual and their will over external determinants such as groups, society, traditions and ideological systems. Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy, but it refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict. Benjamin Tucker, a famous 19th century individualist anarchist, held that \"if the individual has the right to govern himself, all external government is tyranny\".\n\nAmong the early influences on individualist anarchism were William Godwin, Josiah Warren (\"sovereignty of the individual\"), Max Stirner (egoism), Lysander Spooner (\"natural law\"), Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (mutualism), Henry David Thoreau (transcendentalism), Herbert Spencer (\"law of equal liberty\") and Anselme Bellegarrigue.\n\nIndividualist anarchism of different kinds have a few things in common. These are the following:\n\n1. The concentration on the individual and their will in preference to any construction such as morality, ideology, social custom, religion, metaphysics, ideas or the will of others.\n\n2. The rejection of or reservations about the idea of revolution, seeing it as a time of mass uprising which could bring about new hierarchies. Instead, they favor more evolutionary methods of bringing about anarchy through alternative experiences and experiments and education which could be brought about today. This is also because it is not seen as desirable for individuals to wait for revolution to start experiencing alternative experiences outside what is offered in the current social system.\n\n3. The view that relationships with other persons or things can be in one's own interest only and can be as transitory and without compromises as desired since in individualist anarchism sacrifice is usually rejected. In this way, Max Stirner recommended associations of egoists. Individual experience and exploration therefore is emphasized.\n\nThe egoist form of individualist anarchism, derived from the philosophy of Max Stirner, supports the individual doing exactly what he pleases—taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules. To Stirner, rights were \"spooks\" in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but \"the individuals are its reality\"—he supported property by force of might rather than moral right. Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw \"associations of egoists\" drawn together by respect for each other's ruthlessness.\n\nFor American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, American individualist anarchism \"stresses the isolation of the individual – his right to his own tools, his mind, his body, and to the products of his labor. To the artist who embraces this philosophy it is \"aesthetic\" anarchism, to the reformer, ethical anarchism, to the independent mechanic, economic anarchism. The former is concerned with philosophy, the latter with practical demonstration. The economic anarchist is concerned with constructing a society on the basis of anarchism. Economically he sees no harm whatever in the private possession of what the individual produces by his own labor, but only so much and no more. The aesthetic and ethical type found expression in the transcendentalism, humanitarianism, and romanticism of the first part of the nineteenth century, the economic type in the pioneer life of the West during the same period, but more favorably after the Civil War\". It is for this reason that it has been suggested that in order to understand American individualist anarchism one must take into account \"the social context of their ideas, namely the transformation of America from a pre-capitalist to a capitalist society [...] the non-capitalist nature of the early U.S. can be seen from the early dominance of self-employment (artisan and peasant production). At the beginning of the 19th century, around 80% of the working (non-slave) male population were self-employed. The great majority of Americans during this time were farmers working their own land, primarily for their own needs\" and so \"[i]ndividualist anarchism is clearly a form of artisanal socialism [...] while communist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism are forms of industrial (or proletarian) socialism\". Contemporary individualist anarchist Kevin Carson characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that \"[u]nlike the rest of the socialist movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a classical liberal movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business\".\nIn European individualist anarchism, a different social context helped the rise of European individualist illegalism and as such \"[t]he illegalists were proletarians who had nothing to sell but their labour power, and nothing to discard but their dignity; if they disdained waged-work, it was because of its compulsive nature. If they turned to illegality it was due to the fact that honest toil only benefited the employers and often entailed a complete loss of dignity, while any complaints resulted in the sack; to avoid starvation through lack of work it was necessary to beg or steal, and to avoid conscription into the army many of them had to go on the run\". A European tendency of individualist anarchism advocated violent individual acts of individual reclamation, propaganda by the deed and criticism of organization. Such individualist anarchist tendencies include French illegalism and Italian anti-organizational insurrectionarism. Bookchin reports that at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th \"it was in times of severe social repression and deadening social quiescence that individualist anarchists came to the foreground of libertarian activity – and then primarily as terrorists. In France, Spain, and the United States, individualistic anarchists committed acts of terrorism that gave anarchism its reputation as a violently sinister conspiracy\".\n\nAnother important tendency within individualist anarchist currents emphasizes individual subjective exploration and defiance of social conventions. Individualist anarchist philosophy attracted \"amongst artists, intellectuals and the well-read, urban middle classes in general\". As such, Murray Bookchin describes a lot of individualist anarchism as people who \"expressed their opposition in uniquely personal forms, especially in fiery tracts, outrageous behavior and aberrant lifestyles in the cultural ghettos of fin de siecle New York, Paris and London. As a credo, individualist anarchism remained largely a bohemian lifestyle, most conspicuous in its demands for sexual freedom ('free love') and enamored of innovations in art, behavior, and clothing\". In this way, free love currents and other radical lifestyles such as naturism had popularity among individualist anarchists.\n\nFor Catalan historian Xavier Diez, individualist anarchism \"under its iconoclastic, antiintelectual, antitheist run, which goes against all sacralized ideas or values it entailed, a philosophy of life which could be considered a reaction against the sacred gods of capitalist society. Against the idea of nation, it opposed its internationalism. Against the exaltation of authority embodied in the military institution, it opposed its antimilitarism. Against the concept of industrial civilization, it opposed its naturist vision\".\n\nIn regards to economic questions, there are diverse positions. There are adherents to mutualism (Proudhon, Émile Armand and early Benjamin Tucker), egoistic disrespect for \"ghosts\" such as private property and markets (Stirner, John Henry Mackay, Lev Chernyi and later Tucker) and adherents to anarcho-communism (Albert Libertad, illegalism and Renzo Novatore). Anarchist historian George Woodcock finds a tendency in individualist anarchism of a \"distrust (of) all co-operation beyond the barest minimum for an ascetic life\".\n\nOn the issue of violence opinions have gone from a violentist point of view mainly exemplified by illegalism and insurrectionary anarchism to one that can be called anarcho-pacifist. In the particular case of Spanish individualist anarchist Miguel Gimenez Igualada, he went from illegalist practice in his youth towards a pacifist position later in his life.\n\nWilliam Godwin can be considered an individualist anarchist and philosophical anarchist who was influenced by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment, and developed what many consider the first expression of modern anarchist thought. According to Peter Kropotkin, Godwin \"the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work\". Godwin advocated extreme individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labor be eliminated. Godwin was a utilitarian who believed that all individuals are not of equal value, with some of us \"of more worth and importance\" than others depending on our utility in bringing about social good. Therefore, he does not believe in equal rights, but the person's life that should be favored that is most conducive to the general good. Godwin opposed government because it infringes on the individual's right to \"private judgement\" to determine which actions most maximize utility, but also makes a critique of all authority over the individual's judgement. This aspect of Godwin's philosophy, minus the utilitarianism, was developed into a more extreme form later by Stirner.\n\nGodwin took individualism to the radical extent of opposing individuals performing together in orchestras, writing in \"Political Justice\" that \"everything understood by the term co-operation is in some sense an evil\". The only apparent exception to this opposition to cooperation is the spontaneous association that may arise when a society is threatened by violent force. One reason he opposed cooperation is he believed it to interfere with an individual's ability to be benevolent for the greater good. Godwin opposes the idea of government, but wrote that a minimal state as a present \"necessary evil\" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. He expressly opposed democracy, fearing oppression of the individual by the majority, though he believed it to be preferable to dictatorship.\nGodwin supported individual ownership of property, defining it as \"the empire to which every man is entitled over the produce of his own industry\". However, he also advocated that individuals give to each other their surplus property on the occasion that others have a need for it, without involving trade (e.g. gift economy). Thus while people have the right to private property, they should give it away as enlightened altruists. This was to be based on utilitarian principles and he said: \"Every man has a right to that, the exclusive possession of which being awarded to him, a greater sum of benefit or pleasure will result than could have arisen from its being otherwise appropriated\". However, benevolence was not to be enforced, being a matter of free individual \"private judgement\". He did not advocate a community of goods or assert collective ownership as is embraced in communism, but his belief that individuals ought to share with those in need was influential on the later development of anarcho-communism.\n\nGodwin's political views were diverse and do not perfectly agree with any of the ideologies that claim his influence as writers of the \"Socialist Standard\", organ of the Socialist Party of Great Britain, consider Godwin both an individualist and a communist; Murray Rothbard did not regard Godwin as being in the individualist camp at all, referring to him as the \"founder of communist anarchism\";<ref name=\"rothbard/burke\">Rothbard, Murray. \"Edmund Burke, Anarchist.\"</ref> and historian Albert Weisbord considers him an individualist anarchist without reservation. Some writers see a conflict between Godwin's advocacy of \"private judgement\" and utilitarianism as he says that ethics requires that individuals give their surplus property to each other resulting in an egalitarian society, but at the same time he insists that all things be left to individual choice. As noted by Kropotkin, many of Godwin's views changed over time.\n\nWilliam Godwin's influenced \"the socialism of Robert Owen and Charles Fourier. After success of his British venture, Owen himself established a cooperative community within the United States at New Harmony, Indiana during 1825. One member of this commune was Josiah Warren (1798–1874), considered to be the first individualist anarchist. After New Harmony failed Warren shifted his ideological loyalties from socialism to anarchism (which was no great leap, given that Owen's socialism had been predicated on Godwin's anarchism)\".\n\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809–1865) was the first philosopher to label himself an \"anarchist\". Some consider Proudhon to be an individualist anarchist while others regard him to be a social anarchist. Some commentators do not identify Proudhon as an individualist anarchist due to his preference for association in large industries, rather than individual control. Nevertheless, he was influential among some of the American individualists—in the 1840s and 1850s, Charles A. Dana and William B. Greene introduced Proudhon's works to the United States. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to Benjamin Tucker.\n\nProudhon opposed government privilege that protects capitalist, banking and land interests and the accumulation or acquisition of property (and any form of coercion that led to it) which he believed hampers competition and keeps wealth in the hands of the few. Proudhon favoured a right of individuals to retain the product of their labour as their own property, but believed that any property beyond that which an individual produced and could possess was illegitimate. Thus he saw private property as both essential to liberty and a road to tyranny, the former when it resulted from labour and was required for labour and the latter when it resulted in exploitation (profit, interest, rent and tax). He generally called the former \"possession\" and the latter \"property\". For large-scale industry, he supported workers associations to replace wage labour and opposed the ownership of land.\n\nProudhon maintained that those who labour should retain the entirety of what they produce and that monopolies on credit and land are the forces that prohibit such. He advocated an economic system that included private property as possession and exchange market, but without profit, which he called mutualism. It is Proudhon's philosophy that was explicitly rejected by Joseph Dejacque in the inception of anarcho-communism, with the latter asserting directly to Proudhon in a letter that \"it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature\". An individualist rather than anarcho-communist, Proudhon said that \"communism [...] is the very denial of society in its foundation\" and famously declared that \"property is theft!\" in reference to his rejection of ownership rights to land being granted to a person who is not using that land.\n\nAfter Dejacque and others split from Proudhon due to the latter's support of individual property and an exchange economy, the relationship between the individualists (who continued in relative alignment with the philosophy of Proudhon) and the anarcho-communists was characterised by various degrees of antagonism and harmony. For example, individualists like Tucker on the one hand translated and reprinted the works of collectivists like Mikhail Bakunin while on the other hand rejected the economic aspects of collectivism and communism as incompatible with anarchist ideals.\n\nMutualism is an anarchist school of thought which can be traced to the writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, who envisioned a society where each person might possess a means of production, either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labor in the free market. Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank which would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate only high enough to cover the costs of administration. Mutualism is based on a labor theory of value which holds that when labour or its product is sold, in exchange it ought to receive goods or services embodying \"the amount of labor necessary to produce an article of exactly similar and equal utility\". Some mutualists believe that if the state did not intervene, as a result of increased competition in the marketplace, individuals would receive no more income than that in proportion to the amount of labor they exert. Mutualists oppose the idea of individuals receiving an income through loans, investments and rent as they believe these individuals are not labouring. Some of them argue that if state intervention ceased, these types of incomes would disappear due to increased competition in capital. Though Proudhon opposed this type of income, he expressed: \"I never meant to [...] forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I believe that all these forms of human activity should remain free and optional for all\".\nInsofar as they ensure the workers right to the full product of their labor, mutualists support markets and private property in the product of labor. However, they argue for conditional titles to land, whose private ownership is legitimate only so long as it remains in use or occupation (which Proudhon called \"possession\"). Proudhon's Mutualism supports labor-owned cooperative firms and associations for \"we need not hesitate, for we have no choice [...] it is necessary to form an ASSOCIATION among workers [...] because without that, they would remain related as subordinates and superiors, and there would ensue two [...] castes of masters and wage-workers, which is repugnant to a free and democratic society\" and so \"it becomes necessary for the workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\". As for capital goods (man-made, non-land, \"means of production\"), mutualist opinion differs on whether these should be commonly managed public assets or private property.\n\nFollowing Proudhon, mutualists originally considered themselves to be libertarian socialists. However, \"some mutualists have abandoned the labor theory of value, and prefer to avoid the term \"socialist.\" But they still retain some cultural attitudes, for the most part, that set them off from the libertarian right\". Mutualists have distinguished themselves from state socialism and do not advocate social control over the means of production. Benjamin Tucker said of Proudhon that \"though opposed to socializing the ownership of capital, Proudhon aimed nevertheless to socialize its effects by making its use beneficial to all instead of a means of impoverishing the many to enrich the few [...] by subjecting capital to the natural law of competition, thus bringing the price of its own use down to cost\".\n\nJohann Kaspar Schmidt (October 25, 1806 – June 26, 1856), better known as Max Stirner (the \"nom de plume\" he adopted from a schoolyard nickname he had acquired as a child because of his high brow, in German 'Stirn'), was a German philosopher, who ranks as one of the literary fathers of nihilism, existentialism, post-modernism and anarchism, especially of individualist anarchism. Stirner's main work is \"The Ego and Its Own\", also known as \"The Ego and His Own\" (\"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\" in German, which translates literally as \"The Only One [individual] and his Property\"). This work was first published in 1844 in Leipzig and has since appeared in numerous editions and translations.\n\nMax Stirner's philosophy, sometimes called egoism, is a form of individualist anarchism. Stirner was a Hegelian philosopher whose \"name appears with familiar regularity in historically oriented surveys of anarchist thought as one of the earliest and best-known exponents of individualist anarchism\". In 1844, his \"The Ego and Its Own\" (\"Der Einzige and sein Eigentum\" which may literally be translated as \"The Unique Individual and His Property\") was published, which is considered to be \"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism\". Stirner does not recommend that the individual try to eliminate the state, but simply that they disregard the state when it conflicts with one's autonomous choices and go along with it when doing so is conducive to one's interests. He says that the egoist rejects pursuit of devotion to \"a great idea, a good cause, a doctirine, a system, a lofty calling,\" saying that the egoist has no political calling, but rather \"lives themselves out\" without regard to \"how well or ill humanity may fare thereby\". Stirner held that the only limitation on the rights of the individual is that individual's power to obtain what he desires. He proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions—including the notion of State, property as a right, natural rights in general, and the very notion of society—were mere spooks in the mind. Stirner wants to \"abolish not only the state but also society as an institution responsible for its members\". Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw Union of egoists, non-systematic associations, which Stirner proposed in as a form of organization in place of the state. A Union is understood as a relation between egoists which is continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will. Even murder is permissible \"if it is right for me\", though it is claimed by egoist anarchists that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals.\n\nFor Stirner, property simply comes about through might: \"Whoever knows how to take, to defend, the thing, to him belongs property\". He further says: \"What I have in my power, that is my own. So long as I assert myself as holder, I am the proprietor of the thing\" and that \"I do not step shyly back from your property, but look upon it always as my property, in which I respect nothing. Pray do the like with what you call my property!\". His concept of \"egoistic property\" not only a lack of moral restraint on how one obtains and uses \"things\", but includes other people as well. His embrace of egoism is in stark contrast to Godwin's altruism. Stirner was opposed to communism, seeing it as a form of authority over the individual.\n\nThis position on property is much different from the Native American, natural law, form of individualist anarchism, which defends the inviolability of the private property that has been earned through labor and trade. However, Benjamin Tucker rejected the natural rights philosophy and adopted Stirner's egoism in 1886, with several others joining with him. This split the American individualists into fierce debate, \"with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself.\" Other egoists include James L. Walker, Sidney Parker, Dora Marsden and John Beverly Robinson.\nIn Russia, individualist anarchism inspired by Stirner combined with an appreciation for Friedrich Nietzsche attracted a small following of bohemian artists and intellectuals such as Lev Chernyi, as well as a few lone wolves who found self-expression in crime and violence. They rejected organizing, believing that only unorganized individuals were safe from coercion and domination, believing this kept them true to the ideals of anarchism. This type of individualist anarchism inspired anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman.\n\nThough Stirner's philosophy is individualist, it has influenced some libertarian communists and anarcho-communists. \"For Ourselves Council for Generalized Self-Management\" discusses Stirner and speaks of a \"communist egoism\", which is said to be a \"synthesis of individualism and collectivism\" and says that \"greed in its fullest sense is the only possible basis of communist society\". Forms of libertarian communism such as Situationism are influenced by Stirner. Anarcho-communist Emma Goldman was influenced by both Stirner and Peter Kropotkin and blended their philosophies together in her own as shown in books of hers such as \"Anarchism And Other Essays\".\n\nJosiah Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, \"The Peaceful Revolutionist\", was the first anarchist periodical published, an enterprise for which he built his own printing press, cast his own type and made his own printing plates. Warren was a follower of Robert Owen and joined Owen's community at New Harmony, Indiana. Warren termed the phrase \"Cost the limit of price\", with \"cost\" here referring not to monetary price paid but the labor one exerted to produce an item. Therefore, \"[h]e proposed a system to pay people with certificates indicating how many hours of work they did. They could exchange the notes at local time stores for goods that took the same amount of time to produce\". He put his theories to the test by establishing an experimental \"labor for labor store\" called the Cincinnati Time Store where trade was facilitated by notes backed by a promise to perform labor. The store proved successful and operated for three years after which it was closed so that Warren could pursue establishing colonies based on mutualism. These included Utopia and Modern Times. Warren said that Stephen Pearl Andrews' \"The Science of Society\" (published in 1852) was the most lucid and complete exposition of Warren's own theories. Catalan historian Xavier Diez report that the intentional communal experiments pioneered by Warren were influential in European individualist anarchists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries such as Émile Armand and the intentional communities started by them.\n\nHenry David Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book \"Walden\", a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings; and his essay, \"Civil Disobedience\", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on green anarchism, but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world influencing later naturist currents, simple living as a rejection of a materialist lifestyle and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in John Zerzan. For George Woodcock, this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid 19th century.\n\nThe essay Civil Disobedience (\"Resistance to Civil Government\") was first published in 1849. It argues that people should not permit governments to overrule or atrophy their consciences and that people have a duty to avoid allowing such acquiescence to enable the government to make them the agents of injustice. Thoreau was motivated in part by his disgust with slavery and the Mexican–American War. The essay later influenced Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., Martin Buber and Leo Tolstoy through its advocacy of nonviolent resistance. It is also the main precedent for anarcho-pacifism. The American version of individualist anarchism has a strong emphasis on the non-aggression principle and individual sovereignty. Some individualist anarchists such as Thoreau do not speak of economics, but simply the right of \"disunion\" from the state and foresee the gradual elimination of the state through social evolution.\n\nAn important current within individualist anarchism is free love. Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, and viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed women's rights since most sexual laws, such as those governing marriage and use of birth control, discriminated against women. The most important American free love journal was \"Lucifer the Lightbearer\" (1883–1907) edited by Moses Harman and Lois Waisbrooker but also there existed Ezra Heywood and Angela Heywood's \"The Word\" (1872–1890, 1892–1893). M. E. Lazarus was also an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love. John William Lloyd, a collaborator of Benjamin Tucker's periodical \"Liberty\", published in 1931 a sex manual that he called \"The Karezza Method: Or Magnetation, the Art of Connubial Love\".\n\nIn Europe, the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Émile Armand. He proposed the concept of \"la camaraderie amoureuse\" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of polyamory. In France, there was also feminist activity inside individualist anarchism as promoted by individualist feminists Marie Küge, Anna Mahé, Rirette Maitrejean and Sophia Zaïkovska.\n\nThe Brazilian individualist anarchist Maria Lacerda de Moura lectured on topics such as education, women's rights, free love and antimilitarism. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Uruguay. She also wrote for the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine \"Al Margen\" alongside Miguel Gimenez Igualada.\n\nIn Germany, the Stirnerists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality.\n\nFreethought as a philosophical position and as activism was important in both North American and European individualist anarchism, but in the United States freethought was basically an anti-Christian, anti-clerical movement whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to \"Liberty\" were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of \"Freethought\" and for a time \"The Truth Seeker\". E.C. Walker was co-editor of \"Lucifer, the Light-Bearer\". Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as \"Lucifer, the Light-Bearer\", \"Freethought\" and \"The Truth Seeker\" appeared in \"Liberty\". The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself.\n\nIn Europe, a similar development occurred in French and Spanish individualist anarchist circles: \"Anticlericalism, just as in the rest of the libertarian movement, is another of the frequent elements which will gain relevance related to the measure in which the (French) Republic begins to have conflicts with the church [...] Anti-clerical discourse, frequently called for by the french individualist André Lorulot, will have its impacts in \"Estudios\" (a Spanish individualist anarchist publication). There will be an attack on institutionalized religion for the responsibility that it had in the past on negative developments, for its irrationality which makes it a counterpoint of philosophical and scientific progress. There will be a criticism of proselitism and ideological manipulation which happens on both believers and agnostics\". This tendencies will continue in French individualist anarchism in the work and activism of Charles-Auguste Bontemps and others. In the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine \"Ética\" and \"Iniciales\", \"there is a strong interest in publishing scientific news, usually linked to a certain atheist and anti-theist obsession, philosophy which will also work for pointing out the incompatibility between science and religion, faith and reason. In this way there will be a lot of talk on Darwin's theories or on the negation of the existence of the soul\".\n\nAnother important current, especially within French and Spanish individualist anarchist groups was naturism. Naturism promoted an ecological worldview, small ecovillages and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity. Naturist individualist anarchists saw the individual in his biological, physical and psychological aspects and avoided and tried to eliminate social determinations. An early influence in this vein was Henry David Thoreau and his famous book \"Walden\". Important promoters of this were Henri Zisly and Émile Gravelle who collaborated in \"La Nouvelle Humanité\" followed by \"Le Naturien\", \"Le Sauvage\", \"L'Ordre Naturel\" and \"La Vie Naturelle\".\n\nThis relationship between anarchism and naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in Spain, when \"[t]he linking role played by the 'Sol y Vida' group was very important. The goal of this group was to take trips and enjoy the open air. The Naturist athenaeum, 'Ecléctico', in Barcelona, was the base from which the activities of the group were launched. First \"Etica\" and then \"Iniciales\", which began in 1929, were the publications of the group, which lasted until the Spanish Civil War. We must be aware that the naturist ideas expressed in them matched the desires that the libertarian youth had of breaking up with the conventions of the bourgeoisie of the time. That is what a young worker explained in a letter to 'Iniciales' He writes it under the odd pseudonym of 'silvestre del campo', (wild man in the country). \"I find great pleasure in being naked in the woods, bathed in light and air, two natural elements we cannot do without. By shunning the humble garment of an exploited person, (garments which, in my opinion, are the result of all the laws devised to make our lives bitter), we feel there no others left but just the natural laws. Clothes mean slavery for some and tyranny for others. Only the naked man who rebels against all norms, stands for anarchism, devoid of the prejudices of outfit imposed by our money-oriented society\". The relation between anarchism and naturism \"gives way to the Naturist Federation, in July 1928, and to the lV Spanish Naturist Congress, in September 1929, both supported by the Libertarian Movement. However, in the short term, the Naturist and Libertarian movements grew apart in their conceptions of everyday life. The Naturist movement felt closer to the Libertarian individualism of some French theoreticians such as Henri Ner (real name of Han Ryner) than to the revolutionary goals proposed by some Anarchist organisations such as the FAI, (Federación Anarquista Ibérica)\".\n\nThe thought of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche has been influential in individualist anarchism, specifically in thinkers such as France's Émile Armand, the Italian Renzo Novatore and the Colombian Biofilo Panclasta. Robert C. Holub, author of \"Nietzsche: Socialist, Anarchist, Feminist\" posits that \"translations of Nietzsche's writings in the United States very likely appeared first in \"Liberty\", the anarchist journal edited by Benjamin Tucker\".\n\nFor American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster, \"[i]t is apparent [...] that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and Stephen Pearl Andrews [...] William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form\". William Batchelder Greene (1819–1878) is best known for the works \"Mutual Banking\"(1850), which proposed an interest-free banking system; and \"Transcendentalism\", a critique of the New England philosophical school. He saw mutualism as the synthesis of \"liberty and order\". His \"associationism [...] is checked by individualism [...] \"Mind your own business,\" \"Judge not that ye be not judged.\" Over matters which are purely personal, as for example, moral conduct, the individual is sovereign, as well as over that which he himself produces. For this reason he demands \"mutuality\" in marriage – the equal right of a woman to her own personal freedom and property and feminist and spiritualist tendencies\".\n\nContemporary American anarchist Hakim Bey reports that \"Steven Pearl Andrews [...] was not a fourierist (see Charles Fourier), but he lived through the brief craze for phalansteries in America & adopted a lot of fourierist principles & practices [...] a maker of worlds out of words. He syncretized Abolitionism, Free Love, spiritual universalism, (Josiah) Warren, & (Charles) Fourier into a grand utopian scheme he called the Universal Pantarchy [...] He was instrumental in founding several \"intentional communities,\" including the \"Brownstone Utopia\" on 14th St. in New York, & \"Modern Times\" in Brentwood, Long Island. The latter became as famous as the best-known fourierist communes (Brook Farm in Massachusetts & the North American Phalanx in New Jersey) – in fact, Modern Times became downright notorious (for \"Free Love\") & finally foundered under a wave of scandalous publicity. Andrews (& Victoria Woodhull) were members of the infamous Section 12 of the 1st International, expelled by Marx for its anarchist, feminist, & spiritualist tendencies\".\n\nAnother form of individualist anarchism was found in the United States as advocated by the so-called Boston anarchists. By default, American individualists had no difficulty accepting the concepts that \"one man employ another\" or that \"he direct him\", in his labor but rather demanded that \"all natural opportunities requisite to the production of wealth be accessible to all on equal terms and that monopolies arising from special privileges created by law be abolished\".\n\nThey believed state monopoly capitalism (defined as a state-sponsored monopoly) prevented labor from being fully rewarded. Voltairine de Cleyre summed up the philosophy by saying that the anarchist individualists \"are firm in the idea that the system of employer and employed, buying and selling, banking, and all the other essential institutions of Commercialism, centred upon private property, are in themselves good, and are rendered vicious merely by the interference of the State\".\n\nEven among the 19th-century American individualists, there was not a monolithic doctrine as they disagreed amongst each other on various issues including intellectual property rights and possession versus property in land. A major schism occurred later in the 19th century when Tucker and some others abandoned their traditional support of natural rights as espoused by Lysander Spooner and converted to an \"egoism\" modeled upon Max Stirner's philosophy. Lysander Spooner besides his individualist anarchist activism was also an important anti-slavery activist and became a member of the First International.\n\nSome Boston anarchists, including Benjamin Tucker, identified themselves as socialists, which in the 19th century was often used in the sense of a commitment to improving conditions of the working class (i.e. \"the labor problem\"). The Boston anarchists such as Tucker and his followers continue to be considered socialists due to their opposition to usury. They do so because as the modern economist Jim Stanford points out there are many different kinds of competitive markets such as market socialism and capitalism is only one type of a market economy.\n\nBy around the start of the 20th century, the heyday of individualist anarchism had passed.\n\nGeorge Woodcock reports that the American individualist anarchists Lysander Spooner and William B. Greene had been members of the socialist First International\nTwo individualist anarchists who wrote in Benjamin Tucker's \"Liberty\" were also important labor organizers of the time. Joseph Labadie (April 18, 1850 – October 7, 1933) was an American labor organizer, individualist anarchist, social activist, printer, publisher, essayist and poet. In 1883, Labadie embraced a non-violent version of individualist anarchism. Without the oppression of the state, Labadie believed, humans would choose to harmonize with \"the great natural laws [...] without robbing [their] fellows through interest, profit, rent and taxes\". However, he supported community cooperation as he supported community control of water utilities, streets and railroads. Although he did not support the militant anarchism of the Haymarket anarchists, he fought for the clemency of the accused because he did not believe they were the perpetrators. In 1888, Labadie organized the Michigan Federation of Labor, became its first president and forged an alliance with Samuel Gompers. A colleague of Labadie's at \"Liberty\", Dyer Lum was another important individualist anarchist labor activist and poet of the era. A leading anarcho-syndicalist and a prominent left-wing intellectual of the 1880s, he is remembered as the lover and mentor of early anarcha-feminist Voltairine de Cleyre. Lum was a prolific writer who wrote a number of key anarchist texts and contributed to publications including \"Mother Earth\", \"Twentieth Century\", \"The Alarm\" (the journal of the International Working People's Association) and \"The Open Court\" among others. Lum's political philosophy was a fusion of individualist anarchist economics—\"a radicalized form of \"laissez-faire\" economics\" inspired by the Boston anarchists—with radical labor organization similar to that of the Chicago anarchists of the time. Herbert Spencer and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon influenced Lum strongly in his individualist tendency. He developed a \"mutualist\" theory of unions and as such was active within the Knights of Labor and later promoted anti-political strategies in the American Federation of Labor. Frustration with abolitionism, spiritualism and labor reform caused Lum to embrace anarchism and radicalize workers. Convinced of the necessity of violence to enact social change he volunteered to fight in the American Civil War, hoping thereby to bring about the end of slavery. Kevin Carson has praised Lum's fusion of individualist \"laissez-faire\" economics with radical labor activism as \"creative\" and described him as \"more significant than any in the Boston group\".\n\nSome of the American individualist anarchists later in this era, such as Benjamin Tucker, abandoned natural rights positions and converted to Max Stirner's egoist anarchism. Rejecting the idea of moral rights, Tucker said that there were only two rights, \"the right of might\" and \"the right of contract\". He also said after converting to Egoist individualism that \"[i]n times past [...] it was my habit to talk glibly of the right of man to land. It was a bad habit, and I long ago sloughed it off [...] Man's only right to land is his might over it\". In adopting Stirnerite egoism in 1886, Tucker rejected natural rights which had long been considered the foundation of libertarianism. This rejection galvanized the movement into fierce debates, with the natural rights proponents accusing the egoists of destroying libertarianism itself. So bitter was the conflict that a number of natural rights proponents withdrew from the pages of \"Liberty\" in protest even though they had hitherto been among its frequent contributors. Thereafter, \"Liberty\" championed egoism although its general content did not change significantly.\n\nSeveral periodicals were undoubtedly influenced by \"Liberty\"'s presentation of egoism. They included \"I\" published by Clarence Lee Swartz, edited by William Walstein Gordak and J. William Lloyd (all associates of \"Liberty\"); and \"The Ego\" and \"The Egoist\", both of which were edited by Edward H. Fulton. Among the egoist papers that Tucker followed were the German \"Der Eigene\", edited by Adolf Brand; and \"The Eagle\" and \"The Serpent\", issued from London. The latter, the most prominent English-language egoist journal, was published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle \"A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology\".\n\nAmerican anarchists who adhered to egoism include Benjamin Tucker, John Beverley Robinson, Steven T. Byington, Hutchins Hapgood, James L. Walker, Victor Yarros and Edward H. Fulton. Robinson wrote an essay called \"Egoism\" in which he states that \"[m]odern egoism, as propounded by Stirner and Nietzsche, and expounded by Ibsen, Shaw and others, is all these; but it is more. It is the realization by the individual that they are an individual; that, as far as they are concerned, they are the only individual\". Walker published the work \"The Philosophy of Egoism\" in which he argued that egosim \"implies a rethinking of the self-other relationship, nothing less than \"a complete revolution in the relations of mankind\" that avoids both the \"archist\" principle that legitimates domination and the \"moralist\" notion that elevates self-renunciation to a virtue. Walker describes himself as an \"egoistic anarchist\" who believed in both contract and cooperation as practical principles to guide everyday interactions\". For Walker, \"what really defines egoism is not mere self-interest, pleasure, or greed; it is the sovereignty of the individual, the full expression of the subjectivity of the individual ego\".\n\nItalian anti-organizationalist individualist anarchism was brought to the United States by Italian born individualists such as Giuseppe Ciancabilla and others who advocated for violent propaganda by the deed there. Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports the incident in which the important Italian social anarchist Errico Malatesta became involved \"in a dispute with the individualist anarchists of Paterson, who insisted that anarchism implied no organization at all, and that every man must act solely on his impulses. At last, in one noisy debate, the individual impulse of a certain Ciancabilla directed him to shoot Malatesta, who was badly wounded but obstinately refused to name his assailant\".\n\nEnrico Arrigoni (pseudonym Frank Brand) was an Italian American individualist anarchist Lathe operator, house painter, bricklayer, dramatist and political activist influenced by the work of Max Stirner. He took the pseudonym Brand from a fictional character in one of Henrik Ibsen's plays. In the 1910s, he started becoming involved in anarchist and anti-war activism around Milan. From the 1910s until the 1920s, he participated in anarchist activities and popular uprisings in various countries including Switzerland, Germany, Hungary, Argentina and Cuba. He lived from the 1920s onwards in New York City, where he edited the individualist anarchist eclectic journal \"Eresia\" in 1928. He also wrote for other American anarchist publications such as \"L' Adunata dei refrattari\", \"Cultura Obrera\", \"Controcorrente\" and \"Intesa Libertaria\". During the Spanish Civil War, he went to fight with the anarchists, but he was imprisoned and was helped on his release by Emma Goldman. Afterwards, Arrigoni became a longtime member of the Libertarian Book Club in New York City. His written works include \"The Totalitarian Nightmare\" (1975), \"The Lunacy of the Superman\" (1977), \"Adventures in the Country of the Monoliths\" (1981) and \"Freedom: My Dream\" (1986).\n\n19th century individualist anarchists espoused the labor theory of value. Many believe that the modern movement of anarcho-capitalism is the result of simply removing the labor theory of value from ideas of the 19th-century American individualist anarchists: \"Their successors today, such as Murray Rothbard, having abandoned the labor theory of value, describe themselves as anarcho-capitalists\". As economic theory changed, the popularity of the labor theory of classical economics was superseded by the subjective theory of value of neo-classical economics. Murray Rothbard, a student of Ludwig von Mises, combined Mises' Austrian School of economics with the absolutist views of human rights and rejection of the state he had absorbed from studying the individualist American anarchists of the 19th century such as Lysander Spooner and Benjamin Tucker. In the mid-1950s, Rothbard wrote an article under a pseudonym, saying that \"we are not anarchists [...] but not archists either [...] Perhaps, then, we could call ourselves by a new name: nonarchist\", concerned with differentiating himself from communist and socialistic economic views of other anarchists (including the individualist anarchists of the 19th century). There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.\n\nAgorism was developed from anarcho-capitalism in the late 20th century by Samuel Edward Konkin III. The goal of agorists is a society in which all \"relations between people are voluntary exchanges – a free market\". Agorists are market anarchists. Most agorists consider that property rights are natural rights deriving from the primary right of self-ownership. Because of this, they are not opposed in principle to collectively held property if individual owners of the property consent to collective ownership by contract or other voluntary mutual agreement. However, agorists are divided on the question of intellectual property rights.\n\nThough anarcho-capitalism has been regarded by some as a form of individualist anarchism, anarcho-capitalist author Murray Rothbard stated that individualist anarchism is different from capitalism due to the individualist anarchists retaining the labor theory of value and many writers deny that anarcho-capitalism is a form of anarchism at all, or that capitalism itself is compatible with anarchism.\n\nLeft-wing market anarchism, a form of left-libertarianism, individualist anarchism and libertarian socialism, is associated with scholars such as Kevin Carson, Roderick T. Long, Charles Johnson, Brad Spangler, Samuel Edward Konkin III, Sheldon Richman, Chris Matthew Sciabarra and Gary Chartier, who stress the value of radically free markets, termed \"freed markets\" to distinguish them from the common conception which these libertarians believe to be riddled with statist and capitalist privileges. Referred to as left-wing market anarchists or market-oriented left-libertarians, proponents of this approach strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets while maintaining that taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support anti-capitalist, anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions in economics; anti-imperialism in foreign policy; and thoroughly liberal or radical views regarding such cultural issues as gender, sexuality and race.\n\nThe genealogy of contemporary market-oriented left-libertarianism, sometimes labeled \"left-wing market anarchism\", overlaps to a significant degree with that of Steiner–Vallentyne left-libertarianism as the roots of that tradition are sketched in the book \"The Origins of Left-Libertarianism\". Carson–Long-style left-libertarianism is rooted in 19th-century mutualism and in the work of figures such as Thomas Hodgskin and the individualist anarchists Benjamin Tucker and Lysander Spooner. While with notable exceptions market-oriented libertarians after Tucker tended to ally with the political right, relationships between such libertarians and the New Left thrived in the 1960s, laying the groundwork for modern left-wing market anarchism. Left-wing market anarchism identifies with Left-libertarianism (or left-wing libertarianism) which names several related but distinct approaches to politics, society, culture, and political and social theory, which stress both individual freedom and social justice. Unlike right-libertarians, they believe that neither claiming nor mixing one's labor with natural resources is enough to generate full private property rights and maintain that natural resources (land, oil, gold, trees) ought to be held in some egalitarian manner, either unowned or owned collectively. Those left-libertarians who support private property do so under the condition that recompense is offered to the local community.\n\nMurray Bookchin has identified post-left anarchy as a form of individualist anarchism in \"\" where he identifies \"a shift among Euro-American anarchists away from social anarchism and toward individualist or lifestyle anarchism. Indeed, lifestyle anarchism today is finding its principal expression in spray-can graffiti, post-modernist nihilism, antirationalism, neo-primitivism, anti-technologism, neo-Situationist 'cultural terrorism', mysticism, and a 'practice' of staging Foucauldian 'personal insurrections'\". Post-left anarchist Bob Black in his long critique of Bookchin's philosophy called \"Anarchy After Leftism\" said about post-left anarchy that \"[i]t is, unlike Bookchinism, \"individualistic\" in the sense that if the freedom and happiness of the individual – i.e., each and every really existing person, every Tom, Dick and Murray – is not the measure of the good society, what is?\".\n\nA strong relationship does exist between post-left anarchism and the work of individualist anarchist Max Stirner. Jason McQuinn says that \"when I (and other anti-ideological anarchists) criticize ideology, it is always from a specifically critical, anarchist perspective rooted in both the skeptical, individualist-anarchist philosophy of Max Stirner. Bob Black and Feral Faun/Wolfi Landstreicher also strongly adhere to stirnerist egoist anarchism. Bob Black has humorously suggested the idea of \"marxist stirnerism\".\n\nHakim Bey has said: \"From Stirner's \"Union of Self-Owning Ones\" we proceed to Nietzsche's circle of \"Free Spirits\" and thence to Charles Fourier's \"Passional Series\", doubling and redoubling ourselves even as the Other multiplies itself in the eros of the group\". Bey also wrote: \"The Mackay Society, of which Mark & I are active members, is devoted to the anarchism of Max Stirner, Benj. Tucker & John Henry Mackay [...] The Mackay Society, incidentally, represents a little-known current of individualist thought which never cut its ties with revolutionary labor. Dyer Lum, Ezra & Angela Haywood represent this school of thought; Jo Labadie, who wrote for Tucker's \"Liberty\", made himself a link between the American \"plumb-line\" anarchists, the \"philosophical\" individualists, & the syndicalist or communist branch of the movement; his influence reached the Mackay Society through his son, Laurance. Like the Italian Stirnerites (who influenced us through our late friend Enrico Arrigoni) we support all anti-authoritarian currents, despite their apparent contradictions\".\n\nAs far as posterior individualist anarchists, Jason McQuinn for some time used the pseudonym Lev Chernyi in honor of the Russian individualist anarchist of the same name while Feral Faun has quoted Italian individualist anarchist Renzo Novatore and has translated both Novatore and the young Italian individualist anarchist Bruno Filippi\n\nEgoism has had a strong influence on insurrectionary anarchism, as can be seen in the work of Wolfi Landstreicher. Feral Faun wrote in 1995: In the game of insurgence – a lived guerilla war game – it is strategically necessary to use identities and roles. Unfortunately, the context of social relationships gives these roles and identities the power to define the individual who attempts to use them. So I, Feral Faun, became [...] an anarchist [...] a writer [...] a Stirner-influenced, post-situationist, anti-civilization theorist [...] if not in my own eyes, at least in the eyes of most people who've read my writings.\n\nEuropean individualist anarchism proceeded from the roots laid by William Godwin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Max Stirner. Proudhon was an early pioneer of anarchism as well as of the important individualist anarchist current of mutualism. Stirner became a central figure of individualist anarchism through the publication of his seminal work \"The Ego and Its Own\" which is considered to be \"a founding text in the tradition of individualist anarchism\". Another early figure was Anselme Bellegarrigue. Individualist anarchism expanded and diversified through Europe, incorporating influences from North American individualist anarchism.\n\nEuropean individualist anarchists include Albert Libertad, Bellegarrigue, Oscar Wilde, Émile Armand, Lev Chernyi, John Henry Mackay, Han Ryner, Adolf Brand, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Renzo Novatore and currently Michel Onfray. Important currents within it include free love, anarcho-naturism and illegalism.\n\nFrom the legacy of Proudhon and Stirner there emerged a strong tradition of French individualist anarchism. An early important individualist anarchist was Anselme Bellegarrigue. He participated in the French Revolution of 1848, was author and editor of \"Anarchie, Journal de l'Ordre and Au fait ! Au fait ! Interprétation de l'idée démocratique\" and wrote the important early Anarchist Manifesto in 1850. Catalan historian of individualist anarchism Xavier Diez reports that during his travels in the United States \"he at least contacted (Henry David) Thoreau and, probably (Josiah) Warren\". \"Autonomie Individuelle\" was an individualist anarchist publication that ran from 1887 to 1888. It was edited by Jean-Baptiste Louiche, Charles Schæffer and Georges Deherme.\n\nLater, this tradition continued with such intellectuals as Albert Libertad, André Lorulot, Émile Armand, Victor Serge, Zo d'Axa and Rirette Maitrejean, who in 1905 developed theory in the main individualist anarchist journal in France, \"L'Anarchie\". Outside this journal, Han Ryner wrote \"Petit Manuel individualiste\" (1903). In 1891, Zo d'Axa created the journal L'En-Dehors.\n\nAnarcho-naturism was promoted by Henri Zisly, Emile Gravelle and Georges Butaud. Butaud was an individualist \"partisan of the \"milieux libres\", publisher of \"Flambeau\" (\"an enemy of authority\") in 1901 in Vienna\" and most of his energies were devoted to creating anarchist colonies (communautés expérimentales) in which he participated in several.\n\nIn this sense, \"the theoretical positions and the vital experiences of [F]rench individualism are deeply iconoclastic and scandalous, even within libertarian circles. The call of nudist naturism, the strong defence of bith control methods, the idea of \"unions of egoists\" with the sole justification of sexual practices, that will try to put in practice, not without difficulties, will establish a way of thought and action, and will result in sympathy within some, and a strong rejection within others\".\nFrench individualist anarchists grouped behind Émile Armand, published \"L'Unique\" after World War II. \"L'Unique\" went from 1945 to 1956 with a total of 110 numbers. Gérard de Lacaze-Duthiers was a French writer, art critic, pacifist and anarchist. Lacaze-Duthiers, an art critic for the Symbolist review journal \"La Plume\", was influenced by Oscar Wilde, Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner. His (1906) \"L'Ideal Humain de l'Art\" helped found the \"artistocracy movement\"—a movement advocating life in the service of art. His ideal was an anti-elitist aestheticism: \"All men should be artists\". Together with André Colomer and Manuel Devaldes, in 1913 he founded \"L'Action d'Art\", an anarchist literary journal. After World War II, he contributed to the journal \"L'Unique\". Within the synthesist anarchist organization, the Fédération Anarchiste, there existed an individualist anarchist tendency alongside anarcho-communist and anarchosyndicalist currents. Individualist anarchists participating inside the Fédération Anarchiste included Charles-Auguste Bontemps, Georges Vincey and André Arru. The new base principles of the francophone Anarchist Federation were written by the individualist anarchist Charles-Auguste Bontemps and the anarcho-communist Maurice Joyeux which established an organization with a plurality of tendencies and autonomy of federated groups organized around synthesist principles. Charles-Auguste Bontemps was a prolific author mainly in the anarchist, freethinking, pacifist and naturist press of the time. His view on anarchism was based around his concept of \"Social Individualism\" on which he wrote extensively. He defended an anarchist perspective which consisted on \"a collectivism of things and an individualism of persons\".\n\nIn 2002, Libertad organized a new version of the \"L'EnDehors\", collaborating with \"Green Anarchy\" and including several contributors, such as Lawrence Jarach, Patrick Mignard, Thierry Lodé, Ron Sakolsky and Thomas Slut. Numerous articles about capitalism, human rights, free love and social fights were published. \"The EnDehors\" continues now as a website, EnDehors.org.\n\nThe prolific contemporary French philosopher Michel Onfray has been writing from an individualist anarchist perspective influenced by Nietzsche, French post-structuralists thinkers such as Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze; and Greek classical schools of philosophy such as the Cynics and Cyrenaics. Among the books which best expose Onfray's individualist anarchist perspective include \"La sculpture de soi : la morale esthétique\" (\"The Sculpture of Oneself: Aesthetic Morality\"), \"La philosophie féroce : exercices anarchistes\", \"La puissance d'exister\" and \"Physiologie de Georges Palante, portrait d'un nietzchéen de gauche\" which focuses on French individualist philosopher Georges Palante.\n\nIllegalism is an anarchist philosophy that developed primarily in France, Italy, Belgium and Switzerland during the early 1900s as an outgrowth of Stirner's individualist anarchism. Illegalists usually did not seek moral basis for their actions, recognizing only the reality of \"might\" rather than \"right\"; and for the most part, illegal acts were done simply to satisfy personal desires, not for some greater ideal, although some committed crimes as a form of propaganda of the deed. The illegalists embraced direct action and propaganda of the deed.\n\nInfluenced by theorist Max Stirner's egoism as well as Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (his view that \"Property is theft!\"), Clément Duval and Marius Jacob proposed the theory of la \"reprise individuelle\" (individual reclamation) which justified robbery on the rich and personal direct action against exploiters and the system.\n\nIllegalism first rose to prominence among a generation of Europeans inspired by the unrest of the 1890s, during which Ravachol, Émile Henry, Auguste Vaillant and Sante Geronimo Caserio committed daring crimes in the name of anarchism in what is known as propaganda of the deed. France's Bonnot Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.\n\nIn Italy, individualist anarchism had a strong tendency towards illegalism and violent propaganda by the deed similar to French individualist anarchism, but perhaps more extreme and which emphazised criticism of organization be it anarchist or of other type. In this respect, we can consider notorious magnicides carried out or attempted by individualists Giovanni Passannante, Sante Caserio, Michele Angiolillo, Luigi Luccheni and Gaetano Bresci who murdered King Umberto I. Caserio lived in France and coexisted within French illegalism and later assassinated French President Sadi Carnot. The theoretical seeds of current insurrectionary anarchism were already laid out at the end of 19th century Italy in a combination of individualist anarchism criticism of permanent groups and organization with a socialist class struggle worldview. During the rise of fascism, this thought also motivated Gino Lucetti, Michele Schirru and Angelo Sbardellotto in attempting the assassination of Benito Mussolini.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, the intellectual work of individualist anarchist Renzo Novatore came to importance and he was influenced by Max Stirner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Georges Palante, Oscar Wilde, Henrik Ibsen, Arthur Schopenhauer and Charles Baudelaire. He collaborated in numerous anarchist journals and participated in futurism avant-garde currents. In his thought, he adhered to Stirnerist disrespect for private property, only recognizing property of one's own spirit. Novatore collaborated in the individualist anarchist journal \"Iconoclasta!\" alongside the young Stirnerist illegalist Bruno Filippi.\n\nThe individualist philosopher and poet Renzo Novatore belonged to the leftist section of the avant-garde movement of futurism alongside other individualist anarcho-futurists such as Dante Carnesecchi, Leda Rafanelli, Auro d'Arcola and Giovanni Governato. There was also Pietro Bruzzi who published the journal \"L'Individualista\" in the 1920s alongside Ugo Fedeli and Francesco Ghezzi, but who fell to fascist forces later. Bruzzi also collaborated with the Italian American individualist anarchist publication \"Eresia\" of New York City edited by Enrico Arrigoni.\n\nIn 1945 in Italy during the Founding Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation, there was a group of individualist anarchists led by Cesare Zaccaria who was an important anarchist of the time. Later during the IX Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation in Carrara in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the \"Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica\". In the 1970s, it was mostly composed of \"veteran individualist anarchists with an of pacifism orientation, naturism\".\n\nIn the famous Italian insurrectionary anarchist essay written by an anonymous writer, \"At Daggers Drawn with the Existent, its Defenders and its False Critics\", there reads: \"The workers who, during a wildcat strike, carried a banner saying, 'We are not asking for anything' understood that the defeat is in the claim itself ('the claim against the enemy is eternal'). There is no alternative but to take everything. As Stirner said: 'No matter how much you give them, they will always ask for more, because what they want is no less than the end of every concession'\". The contemporary imprisoned Italian insurrectionary anarchist philosopher writes from an explicit individualist anarchist perspective in such essays as \"Critica individualista anarchica alla modernità\" (\"Individualist Anarchist Critique of Modernity\") Horst Fantazzini (March 4, 1939 – December 24, 2001) was an Italian-German individualist anarchist who pursued an illegalist lifestyle and practice until his death in 2001. He gained media notoriety mainly due to his many bank robberies through Italy and other countries. In 1999, the film \"Ormai è fatta!\" appeared based on his life.\n\nWhile Spain was influenced by American individualist anarchism, it was more closely related to the French currents. Around the start of the 20th century, individualism in Spain gathered force through the efforts of people such as Dorado Montero, Ricardo Mella, Federico Urales, Miguel Gimenez Igualada, Mariano Gallardo and J. Elizalde who translated French and American individualists. Important in this respect were also magazines such as \"La Idea Libre\", \"La revista blanca\", \"Etica\", \"Iniciales\", \"Al margen\", \"Estudios\" and \"Nosotros\". The most influential thinkers there were Max Stirner, Émile Armand and Han Ryner. Just as in France, the spread of Esperanto and anationalism had importance just as naturism and free love currents. Later, Armand and Ryner themselves started writing in the Spanish individualist press. Armand's concept of amorous camaraderie had an important role in motivating polyamory as realization of the individual.\n\nCatalan historian Xavier Diez reports that the Spanish individualist anarchist press was widely read by members of anarcho-communist groups and by members of the anarcho-syndicalist trade union CNT. There were also the cases of prominent individualist anarchists such as Federico Urales and Miguel Gimenez Igualada who were members of the CNT and J. Elizalde who was a founding member and first secretary of the Iberian Anarchist Federation (IAF).\n\nSpanish individualist anarchist Miguel Giménez Igualada wrote the lengthy theory book called \"Anarchism\" espousing his individualist anarchism. Between October 1937 and February 1938, he was editor of the individualist anarchist magazine \"Nosotros\" in which many works of Armand and Ryner appeared. He also participated in the publishing of another individualist anarchist maganize \"Al Margen: Publicación quincenal individualista\". In his youth, he engaged in illegalist activities. His thought was deeply influenced by Max Stirner, of which he was the main popularizer in Spain through his own writings. He published and wrote the preface to the fourth edition in Spanish of \"The Ego and Its Own\" from 1900. He proposed the creation of a \"Union of egoists\" to be a federation of individualist anarchists in Spain, but it did not succeed. In 1956, he published an extensive treatise on Stirner, dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Émile Armand. Afterwards, he traveled and lived in Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico.\n\nFederico Urales was an important individualist anarchist who edited \"La Revista Blanca\". The individualist anarchism of Urales was influenced by Auguste Comte and Charles Darwin. He saw science and reason as a defense against blind servitude to authority. He was critical of influential individualist thinkers such as Nietzsche and Stirner for promoting an asocial egoist individualism and instead promoted an individualism with solidarity seen as a way to guarantee social equality and harmony. He was highly critical of anarcho-syndicalism, which he viewed as plagued by excessive bureaucracy; and he thought that it tended towards reformism. Instead, he favored small groups based on ideological alignment. He supported and participated in the establishment of the IAF in 1927.\n\nIn 1956, Miguel Giménez Igualada—on exile escaping from Franco's dictatorship—published an extensive treatise on Stirner which he dedicated to fellow individualist anarchist Émile Armand. On the subject of individualist anarchist theory, he publisheds \"Anarchism\" in 1968 during his exile in Mexico from Franco's dictatorship in Spain. He was present in the First Congress of the Mexican Anarchist Federation in 1945.\n\nIn 2000, Ateneo Libertario Ricardo Mella, Ateneo Libertario Al Margen, Ateneu Enciclopèdic Popular, Ateneo Libertario de Sant Boi and Ateneu Llibertari Poble Sec y Fundació D'Estudis Llibertaris i Anarcosindicalistes republished Émile Armand's writings on free love and individualist anarchism in a compilation titled \"Individualist anarchism and Amorous camaraderie\". Recently, Spanish historian Xavier Diez has dedicated extensive research on Spanish individualist anarchism as can be seen in his books \"El anarquismo individualista en España: 1923–1938\" and \"Utopia sexual a la premsa anarquista de Catalunya. La revista Ética-Iniciales(1927–1937)\" which deals with free love thought as present in the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine \"Iniciales\".\n\nIn Germany, the Scottish-German John Henry McKay became the most important propagandist for individualist anarchist ideas. He fused Stirnerist egoism with the positions of Benjamin Tucker and actually translated Tucker into German. Two semi-fictional writings of his own, \"Die Anarchisten\" and \"Der Freiheitsucher\", contributed to individualist theory through an updating of egoist themes within a consideration of the anarchist movement. English translations of these works arrived in the United Kingdom and in individualist American circles led by Tucker. McKay is also known as an important European early activist for gay rights.\n\nUsing the pseudonym Sagitta, Mackay wrote a series of works for pederastic emancipation, titled \"Die Buecher der namenlosen Liebe\" (\"Books of the Nameless Love\"). This series was conceived in 1905 and completed in 1913 and included the \"Fenny Skaller\", a story of a pederast. Under the same pseudonym, he also published fiction, such as \"Holland\" (1924) and a pederastic novel of the Berlin boy-bars, \"Der Puppenjunge\" (\"The Hustler\") (1926).\nAdolf Brand (1874–1945) was a German writer, Stirnerist anarchist and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male bisexuality and homosexuality. In 1896, Brand published a German homosexual periodical, \"Der Eigene\". This was the first ongoing homosexual publication in the world. The name was taken from writings of egoist philosopher Max Stirner (who had greatly influenced the young Brand) and refers to Stirner's concept of \"self-ownership\" of the individual. \"Der Eigene\" concentrated on cultural and scholarly material and may have had an average of around 1,500 subscribers per issue during its lifetime, although the exact numbers are uncertain. Contributors included Erich Mühsam, Kurt Hiller, John Henry Mackay (under the pseudonym Sagitta) and artists Wilhelm von Gloeden, Fidus and Sascha Schneider. Brand contributed many poems and articles himself. Benjamin Tucker followed this journal from the United States.\n\n\"Der Einzige\" was a German individualist anarchist magazine. It appeared in 1919 as a weekly, then sporadically until 1925 and was edited by cousins Anselm Ruest (pseudonym for Ernst Samuel) and Mynona (pseudonym for Salomo Friedlaender). Its title was adopted from the book \"Der Einzige und sein Eigentum\" (\"The Ego and Its Own\") by Max Stirner. Another influence was the thought of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The publication was connected to the local expressionist artistic current and the transition from it towards Dada.\n\nThe English Enlightenment political theorist William Godwin was an important influence as mentioned before. The Irish anarchist writer of the Decadent Movement Oscar Wilde influenced individualist anarchists such as Renzo Novatore and gained the admiration of Benjamin Tucker. In his important essay \"The Soul of Man under Socialism\" from 1891, Wilde defended socialism as the way to guarantee individualism and so he saw that \"[w]ith the abolition of private property, then, we shall have true, beautiful, healthy Individualism. Nobody will waste his life in accumulating things, and the symbols for things. One will live. To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all\". For anarchist historian George Woodcock, \"Wilde's aim in \"The Soul of Man under Socialism\" is to seek the society most favorable to the artist [...] for Wilde art is the supreme end, containing within itself enlightenment and regeneration, to which all else in society must be subordinated [...] Wilde represents the anarchist as aesthete\". Woodcock finds that \"[t]he most ambitious contribution to literary anarchism during the 1890s was undoubtedly Oscar Wilde \"The Soul of Man under Socialism\"\" and finds that it is influenced mainly by the thought of William Godwin.\n\nIn the late 19th century in the United Kingdom, there existed individualist anarchists such as Wordsworth Donisthorpe, Joseph Hiam Levy, Joseph Greevz Fisher, John Badcock Jr., Albert Tarn and Henry Albert Seymour who were close to the United States group around Benjamin Tucker's magazine \"Liberty\". In the mid-1880s, Seymour published a journal called \"The Anarchist\" and also later took a special interest in free love as he participated in the journal \"The Adult: A Journal for the Advancement of Freedom in Sexual Relationships\". \"The Serpent\", issued from London, was the most prominent English-language egoist journal and published from 1898 to 1900 with the subtitle \"A Journal of Egoistic Philosophy and Sociology\". Henry Meulen was another British anarchist who was notable for his support of free banking.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Herbert Read was influenced highly by egoism as he later approached existentialism (see existentialist anarchism). Albert Camus devoted a section of \"The Rebel\" to Stirner. Although throughout his book Camus is concerned to present \"the rebel\" as a preferred alternative to \"the revolutionary\", he nowhere acknowledges that this distinction is taken from the one that Stirner makes between \"the revolutionary\" and \"the insurrectionist\". Sidney Parker is a British egoist individualist anarchist who wrote articles and edited anarchist journals from 1963 to 1993 such as \"Minus One\", \"Egoist\", and \"Ego\". Donald Rooum is an English anarchist cartoonist and writer with a long association with Freedom Press. Rooum stated that for his thought, \"[t]he most influential source is Max Stirner. I am happy to be called a Stirnerite anarchist, provided 'Stirnerite' means one who agrees with Stirner's general drift, not one who agrees with Stirner's every word\". \"An Anarchist FAQ\" reports: \"From meeting anarchists in Glasgow during the Second World War, long-time anarchist activist and artist Donald Rooum likewise combined Stirner and anarcho-communism\".\n\nIn the hybrid of post-structuralism and anarchism called post-anarchism, Saul Newman has written a lot on Stirner and his similarities to post-structuralism. He writes: Max Stirner's impact on contemporary political theory is often neglected. However in Stirner's political thinking there can be found a surprising convergence with poststructuralist theory, particularly with regard to the function of power. Andrew Koch, for instance, sees Stirner as a thinker who transcends the Hegelian tradition he is usually placed in, arguing that his work is a precursor poststructuralist ideas about the foundations of knowledge and truth.\n\nNewman has published several essays on Stirner. \"War on the State: Stirner and Deleuze's Anarchism\" and \"Empiricism, Pluralism, and Politics in Deleuze and Stirner\" discusses what he sees are similarities between Stirner's thought and that of Gilles Deleuze. In \"Spectres of Stirner: A Contemporary Critique of Ideology\", he discusses the conception of ideology in Stirner. In \"Stirner and Foucault: Toward a Post-Kantian Freedom\", similarities between Stirner and Michel Foucault. He also wrote \"Politics of the Ego: Stirner's Critique of Liberalism\".\n\nIndividualist anarchism was one of the three categories of anarchism in Russia, along with the more prominent anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism. The ranks of the Russian individualist anarchists were predominantly drawn from the intelligentsia and the working class. For anarchist historian Paul Avrich, \"[t]he two leading exponents of individualist anarchism, both based in Moscow, were Aleksei Alekseevich Borovoi and Lev Chernyi (Pavel Dmitrievich Turchaninov). From Nietzsche, they inherited the desire for a complete overturn of all values accepted by bourgeois society political, moral, and cultural. Furthermore, strongly influenced by Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker, the German and American theorists of individualist anarchism, they demanded the total liberation of the human personality from the fetters of organized society\".\n\nSome Russian individualists anarchists \"found the ultimate expression of their social alienation in violence and crime, others attached themselves to avant-garde literary and artistic circles, but the majority remained \"philosophical\" anarchists who conducted animated parlor discussions and elaborated their individualist theories in ponderous journals and books\".\n\nLev Chernyi was an important individualist anarchist involved in resistance against the rise to power of the Bolshevik Party as he adhered mainly to Stirner and the ideas of Tucker. In 1907, he published a book entitled \"Associational Anarchism\", in which he advocated the \"free association of independent individuals\". On his return from Siberia in 1917, he enjoyed great popularity among Moscow workers as a lecturer. Chernyi was also Secretary of the Moscow Federation of Anarchist Groups, which was formed in March 1917. He was an advocate \"for the seizure of private homes\", which was an activity seen by the anarchists after the October Revolution as direct expropriation on the bourgoise. He died after being accused of participation in an episode in which this group bombed the headquarters of the Moscow Committee of the Communist Party. Although most likely not being really involved in the bombing, he might have died of torture.\n\nChernyi advocated a Nietzschean overthrow of the values of bourgeois Russian society, and rejected the voluntary communes of anarcho-communist Peter Kropotkin as a threat to the freedom of the individual. Scholars including Avrich and Allan Antliff have interpreted this vision of society to have been greatly influenced by the individualist anarchists Max Stirner and Benjamin Tucker. Subsequent to the book's publication, Chernyi was imprisoned in Siberia under the Russian Czarist regime for his revolutionary activities.\n\nOn the other hand, Aleksei Borovoi (1876?–1936) was a professor of philosophy at Moscow University, \"a gifted orator and the author of numerous books, pamphlets, and articles which attempted to reconcile individualist anarchism with the doctrines of syndicallism\". He wrote among other theoretical works \"Anarkhizm\" in 1918, just after the October Revolution; and \"Anarchism and Law\". For him, \"the chief importance is given not to Anarchism as the aim but to Anarchy as the continuous quest for the aim\". He manifests there that \"[n]o social ideal, from the point of view of anarchism, could be referred to as absolute in a sense that supposes it's the crown of human wisdom, the end of social and ethical quest of man\".\n\nArgentine anarchist historian Angel Cappelletti reports that in Argentina \"[a]mong the workers that came from Europe in the 2 first decades of the century, there was curiously some stirnerian individualists influenced by the philosophy of Nietzsche, that saw syndicalism as a potential enemy of anarchist ideology. They established [...] affinity groups that in 1912 came to, according to Max Nettlau, to the number of 20. In 1911 there appeared, in Colón, the periodical \"El Único\", that defined itself as 'Publicación individualista'\".\n\nVicente Rojas Lizcano, whose pseudonym was Biófilo Panclasta, was a Colombian individualist anarchist writer and activist. In 1904, he began using the name Biofilo Panclasta. \"Biofilo\" in Spanish stands for \"lover of life\" and \"Panclasta\" for \"enemy of all\". He visited more than fifty countries propagandizing for anarchism which in his case was highly influenced by the thought of Stirner and Nietszche. Among his written works there are \"Siete años enterrado vivo en una de las mazmorras de Gomezuela: Horripilante relato de un resucitado\"(1932) and \"Mis prisiones, mis destierros y mi vida\" (1929) which talk about his many adventures while living his life as an adventurer, activist and vagabond as well as his thought and the many times he was imprisoned in different countries.\nMaria Lacerda de Moura was a Brazilian teacher, journalist, anarcha-feminist and individualist anarchist. Her ideas regarding education were largely influenced by Francisco Ferrer. She later moved to São Paulo and became involved in journalism for the anarchist and labor press. There she also lectured on topics including education, women's rights, free love and antimilitarism. Her writings and essays garnered her attention not only in Brazil, but also in Argentina and Uruguay. In February 1923, she launched \"Renascença\", a periodical linked with the anarchist, progressive and freethinking circles of the period. Her thought was mainly influenced by individualist anarchists such as Han Ryner and Émile Armand. She maintained contact with Spanish individualist anarchist circles.\n\nHorst Matthai Quelle was a Spanish language German anarchist philosopher influenced by Max Stirner. In 1938 at the beginning of the German economic crisis and the rise of Nazism and fascism in Europe, Quelle moved to Mexico. Quelle earned his undergraduate degree, master's and doctorate in philosophy at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, where he returned as a professor of philosophy in the 1980s. He argued that since the individual gives form to the world, he is those objects, the others and the whole universe. One of his main views was a \"theory of infinite worlds\" which for him was developed by pre-socratic philosophers.\n\nDuring the 1990s in Argentina, there appeared a Stirnerist publication called \"El Único: publicacion periódica de pensamiento individualista\".\n\nPhilosopher Murray Bookchin criticized individualist anarchism for its opposition to democracy and its embrace of \"lifestylism\" at the expense of class struggle. Bookchin claimed that individualist anarchism supports only negative liberty and rejects the idea of positive liberty. Philosopher Albert Meltzer proposed that individualist anarchism differs radically from revolutionary anarchism and that it \"is sometimes too readily conceded 'that this is, after all, anarchism'\". He claimed that Benjamin Tucker's acceptance of the use of a private police force (including to break up violent strikes to protect the \"employer's 'freedom'\") is contradictory to the definition of anarchism as \"no government\".\n\nPhilosopher George Bernard Shaw initially had flirtations with individualist anarchism before coming to the conclusion that it was \"the negation of socialism, and is, in fact, unsocialism carried as near to its logical conclusion as any sane man dare carry it\". Shaw's argument was that even if wealth was initially distributed equally, the degree of \"laissez-faire\" advocated by Tucker would result in the distribution of wealth becoming unequal because it would permit private appropriation and accumulation. According to academic Carlotta Anderson, American individualist anarchists accept that free competition results in unequal wealth distribution, but they \"do not see that as an injustice\". Tucker explained: \"If I go through life free and rich, I shall not cry because my neighbor, equally free, is richer. Liberty will ultimately make all men rich; it will not make all men equally rich. Authority may (and may not) make all men equally rich in purse; it certainly will make them equally poor in all that makes life best worth living\".\n\n The term \"individualist anarchism\" is often used as a classificatory term, but in very different ways. Some sources, such as \"An Anarchist FAQ\", use the classification \"social anarchism/individualist anarchism\".

It is both urban and rural due to the closeness of Wanju County which almost entirely surrounds Jeonju. (Wanju County has many residents who work in Jeonju.) The name Jeonju literally means \"Perfect Region\" (from the hanja (; jeon) for perfect, (; ju) for region). It is an important tourist center famous for Korean food, historic buildings, sports activities, and innovative festivals.\n\nIn May 2012, Jeonju was chosen as a Creative Cities for Gastronomy as part of UNESCO's Creative Cities Network. This honour recognizes the city's traditional home cooking handed down over thousands of years, its active public and private food research, a system of nurturing talented chefs, and its hosting of distinctive food festivals.\n\nIn the fertile Honam plain, famous for Jeonju Hanok Village and exceptional produce, Jeonju has been an important regional center in the province for centuries. The city was the capital of Hubaekje Kingdom, which was founded by Gyeon Hwon. It was regarded as the spiritual capital of the Joseon Dynasty because the Yi royal family originated there. The Chŏnju Kim in North Korea, who Kim Il-sung was descended from, have their ancestral seat (Bon-gwan) in Jeonju as well.\n\nThe town was occupied by the Donghak peasants' movement in 1894. Jeonju was given metropolitan status in 1935, and the city was founded in 1949.\n\nSince Joseon, it was a metropolis but, left behind the industrialization, it declined compared. It does not have the infrastructure, manufacturing, or heavy industries found in other Korean major cities. Today, Traditional Tour is a major industry in the city.\n\n\nThe local mountains and parks are popular for outdoor recreation due to its rural location. There are historical sites in the area. The city has a zoo, a park, and the Hanguk Sound and Culture Hall, a large, modern concert complex on the Chonbuk National University campus.\n\n\nJeonju is divided into two wards, Deokjin-gu (덕진구) and Wansan-gu (완산구) that, in turn, are divided into approximately 40 neighborhoods.\n\nMany city buses and taxis are available in Jeonju. However, tourists are often advised to walk between points of interest, as many attractions are near each other.\n\n\nJeonju hosts K League team Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors FC. The team's home ground is the Jeonju World Cup Stadium.\n\nJeonju has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification \"Cfa/Cwa\").\nJeonju, like all of Korea, has four distinct seasons (spring, summer, fall, and winter). The winters can have a mix of days that are cool to days that are quite cold. The colder days are often influenced by a high pressure front that brings cold air from Siberia.\n\nIn the summer, the humidity over the Korean peninsula from June through September comes from southeast Asia. Temperatures in spring (late April and through May) and fall (after September 25 and though October) are often in the mid-20s℃ and with low humidity.\n\n\n\n"}

Different from other existing corpora, LIVAC has adopted a rigorous and regular as well as \"Windows\" approach in processing and filtering massive media texts from representative communities in the Pan-Chinese region including Hong Kong, Macau, Taipei, Singapore, Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. The contents are thus deliberately repetitive in most cases, represented by textual samples drawn from editorials, local and international news, cross-Formosan Straits news, as well as news on finance, sports and entertainment. By 2017, 2.5 billion characters of news media texts have been filtered so far, of which 600 million characters have been processed and analyzed and have yielded an expanding Pan-Chinese dictionary of 2 million words from the Pan-Chinese printed media. Through rigorous analysis based on computational methodology, LIVAC has at the same time accumulated a large amount of accurate and meaningful statistical data on the Chinese language and their speech communities in the Pan-Chinese region, and the result shows considerable and important variations.\n\nThe \"Windows\" approach is the most representative feature of LIVAC and has enabled Pan-Chinese media texts to be quantitatively analyzed according to various attributes such as \"locations\", \"time\" and \"subject\" domains. Thus, various types of comparative studies and applications in information technology as well as development of often related innovative applications have been possible. Moreover, LIVAC has allowed longitudinal developments to be taken into account, facilitating Key Word in Context (KWIC) and comprehensive study of target words and their underlying concepts as well as linguistic structures over the past 20 years, based on variables such as \"region\", \"duration\" and \"content\". Results from the extensive and accumulative data analysis contained in LIVAC have enabled the cultivation of textual databases of proper names, place names, organization names, new words, and bi-weekly and annual rosters of media figures. Related applications have included the establishment of verb and adjective databases, the formulation of sentiment indices, and related opinion mining, to measure and compare the popularity of global media figures in the Chinese media (LIVAC Annual Pan-Chinese Celebrity Rosters, later renamed as the Pan-Chinese Media Personalities Rosters) and construction of monthly new word lexicons (LIVAC Annual Pan-Chinese New Word Rosters). On this basis, the analysis of the emergence, diffusion and transformation of new words, and the publication of dictionaries of neologisms have been made possible.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18403", "title": "Logical positivism", "text": "Logical positivism\n\nLogical positivism and logical empiricism, which together formed neopositivism, was a movement in Western philosophy whose central thesis was verificationism, a theory of knowledge which asserted that only statements verifiable through empirical observation are cognitively meaningful. The movement flourished in the 1920s and 1930s in several European centers. \n\nEfforts to convert philosophy to this new \"scientific philosophy\", shared with empirical sciences' best examples, such as Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, sought to prevent confusion rooted in unclear language and unverifiable claims. \n\nThe Berlin Circle and Vienna Circle—groups of philosophers, scientists, and mathematicians in Berlin and Vienna—propounded logical positivism, starting in the late 1920s.\n\nLogical positivists culled from Ludwig Wittgenstein's early philosophy of language the verifiability principle or criterion of meaningfulness. As in Ernst Mach's phenomenalism, whereby the mind knows only actual or potential sensory experience, verificationists took all sciences' basic content to be only sensory experience. And some influence came from Percy Bridgman's musings that others proclaimed as operationalism, whereby a physical theory is understood by what laboratory procedures scientists perform to test its predictions. In verificationism, only the \"verifiable\" was scientific, and thus meaningful (or \"cognitively meaningful\"), whereas the unverifiable, being unscientific, were meaningless \"pseudostatements\" (just \"emotively meaningful\"). Unscientific discourse, as in ethics and metaphysics, would be unfit for discourse by philosophers, newly tasked to organize knowledge, not develop new knowledge.\n\nLogical positivism is sometimes stereotyped as forbidding talk of unobservables, such as microscopic entities or such notions as causality and general principles, but that is an exaggeration. Rather, most neopositivists viewed talk of unobservables as metaphorical or elliptical: direct observations phrased abstractly or indirectly. So \"theoretical terms\" would garner meaning from \"observational terms\" via \"correspondence rules\", and thereby \"theoretical laws\" would be reduced to \"empirical laws\". Via Bertrand Russell's logicism, reducing mathematics to logic, physics' mathematical formulas would be converted to symbolic logic. Via Russell's logical atomism, ordinary language would break into discrete units of meaning. Rational reconstruction, then, would convert ordinary statements into standardized equivalents, all networked and united by a logical syntax. A scientific theory would be stated with its method of verification, whereby a logical calculus or empirical operation could verify its falsity or truth.\n\nIn the late 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and the United States. By then, many had replaced Mach's phenomenalism with Otto Neurath's physicalism, whereby science's content is not actual or potential sensations, but instead is entities publicly observable. Rudolf Carnap, who had sparked logical positivism in the Vienna Circle, had sought to replace \"verification\" with simply \"confirmation\". With World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, \"logical empiricism\", led largely by Carl Hempel, in America, who expounded the covering law model of scientific explanation. Logical positivism became a major underpinning of analytic philosophy, and dominated philosophy in the English-speaking world, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, but especially social sciences, into the 1960s. Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems, and its doctrines were increasingly criticized, most trenchantly by Willard Van Orman Quine, Norwood Hanson, Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, and Carl Hempel.\n\n\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\", by the young Ludwig Wittgenstein, introduced the view of philosophy as \"critique of language\", offering the possibility of a theoretically principled distinction of intelligible versus nonsensical discourse. \"Tractatus\" adhered to a correspondence theory of truth (versus a coherence theory of truth). Wittgenstein's influence also shows in some versions of the verifiability principle. In tractarian doctrine, truths of logic are tautologies, a view widely accepted by logical positivists who were also influenced by Wittgenstein's interpretation of probability although, according to Neurath, some logical positivists found \"Tractatus\" to contain too much metaphysics.\n\nGottlob Frege began the program of reducing mathematics to logic, continued it with Bertrand Russell, but lost interest in this logicism, and Russell continued it with Alfred North Whitehead in their \"Principia Mathematica\", inspiring some of the more mathematical logical posivists, such as Hans Hahn and Rudolf Carnap. (Carnap's early anti-metaphysical works employed Russell's theory of types.) Carnap envisioned a universal language that could reconstruct mathematics and thereby encode physics. Yet Kurt Gödel's incompleteness theorem showed this impossible except in trivial cases, and Alfred Tarski's undefinability theorem shattered all hopes of reducing mathematics to logic. Thus, a universal language failed to stem from Carnap's 1934 work \"Logische Syntax der Sprache\" (\"Logical Syntax of Language\"). Still, some logical positivists, including Carl Hempel, continued support of logicism.\n\nIn Germany, Hegelian metaphysics was a dominant movement, and Hegelian successors such as F H Bradley explained reality by postulating metaphysical entities lacking empirical basis, drawing reaction in the form of positivism. Starting in the late 19th century, there was a \"back to Kant\" movement. Ernst Mach's positivism and phenomenalism were a major influence.\n\nThe Vienna Circle, gathering around University of Vienna and Café Central, was led principally by Moritz Schlick. Schlick had held a neo-Kantian position, but later converted, via Carnap's 1928 book \"Der logische Aufbau der Welt\", that is, \"The Logical Structure of the World\". A 1929 pamphlet written by Otto Neurath, Hans Hahn, and Rudolf Carnap summarized the Vienna Circle's positions. Another member of Vienna Circle to later prove very influential was Carl Hempel. A friendly but tenacious critic of the Circle was Karl Popper, whom Neurath nicknamed the \"Official Opposition\".\n\nCarnap and other Vienna Circle members, including Hahn and Neurath, saw need for a weaker criterion of meaningfulness than verifiability. A radical \"left\" wing—led by Neurath and Carnap—began the program of \"liberalization of empiricism\", and they also emphasized fallibilism and pragmatics, which latter Carnap even suggested as empiricism's basis. A conservative \"right\" wing—led by Schlick and Waismann—rejected both the liberalization of empiricism and the epistemological nonfoundationalism of a move from phenomenalism to physicalism. As Neurath and somewhat Carnap posed science toward social reform, the split in Vienna Circle also reflected political views.\n\nThe Berlin Circle was led principally by Hans Reichenbach.\n\nBoth Moritz Schlick and Rudolf Carnap had been influenced by and sought to define logical positivism versus the neo-Kantianism of Ernst Cassirer—the then leading figure of Marburg school, so called—and against Edmund Husserl's phenomenology. Logical positivists especially opposed Martin Heidegger's obscure metaphysics, the epitome of what logical positivism rejected. In the early 1930s, Carnap debated Heidegger over \"metaphysical pseudosentences\". Despite its revolutionary aims, logical positivism was but one view among many vying within Europe, and logical positivists initially spoke their language.\n\nAs the movement's first emissary to the New World, Moritz Schlick visited Stanford University in 1929, yet otherwise remained in Vienna and was murdered at the University, reportedly by a deranged student, in 1936. That year, a British attendee at some Vienna Circle meetings since 1933, A. J. Ayer saw his \"Language, Truth and Logic\", written in English, import logical positivism to the English-speaking world. By then, the Nazi Party's 1933 rise to power in Germany had triggered flight of intellectuals. In exile in England, Otto Neurath died in 1945. Rudolf Carnap, Hans Reichenbach, and Carl Hempel—Carnap's protégé who had studied in Berlin with Reichenbach—settled permanently in America. Upon Germany's annexation of Austria in 1938, remaining logical positivists, many of whom were also Jewish, were targeted and continued flight. Logical positivism thus became dominant in the English-speaking world.\n\nConcerning reality, the necessary is a state true in all possible worlds—mere logical validity—whereas the contingent hinges on the way the particular world is. Concerning knowledge, the \"a priori\" is knowable before or without, whereas the \"a posteriori\" is knowable only after or through, relevant experience. Concerning statements, the \"analytic\" is true via terms' arrangement and meanings, thus a tautology—true by logical necessity but uninformative about the world—whereas the \"synthetic\" adds reference to a state of facts, a contingency.\n\nIn 1739, David Hume cast a fork aggressively dividing \"relations of ideas\" from \"matters of fact and real existence\", such that all truths are of one type or the other. By Hume's fork, truths by relations among ideas (abstract) all align on one side (analytic, necessary, \"a priori\"), whereas truths by states of actualities (concrete) always align on the other side (synthetic, contingent, \"a posteriori\"). At any treatises containing neither, Hume orders, \"Commit it then to the flames, for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion\".\n\nThus awakened from \"dogmatic slumber\", Immanuel Kant quested to answer Hume's challenge—but by explaining how metaphysics is possible. Eventually, in his 1781 work, Kant crossed the tines of Hume's fork to identify another range of truths by necessity—synthetic \"a priori\", statements claiming states of facts but known true before experience—by arriving at transcendental idealism, attributing the mind a constructive role in phenomena by arranging sense data into the very experience \"space\", \"time\", and \"substance\". Thus, Kant saved Newton's law of universal gravitation from Hume's problem of induction by finding uniformity of nature to be \"a priori\" knowledge. Logical positivists rejected Kant's synthethic \"a priori\", and staked Hume's fork, whereby a statement is either analytic and \"a priori\" (thus necessary and verifiable logically) or synthetic and \"a posteriori\" (thus contingent and verifiable empirically).\n\nEarly, most logical positivists proposed that all knowledge is based on logical inference from simple \"protocol sentences\" grounded in observable facts. In the 1936 and 1937 papers \"Testability and meaning\", individual terms replace sentences as the units of meaning. Further, theoretical terms no longer need to acquire meaning by explicit definition from observational terms: the connection may be indirect, through a system of implicit definitions. (Carnap also provides an important, pioneering discussion of disposition predicates.)\n\nThe logical positivists' initial stance was that a statement is \"cognitively meaningful\" only if some finite procedure conclusively determines its truth. By this verifiability principle, only statements verifiable either by their analyticity or by empiricism were \"cognitively meaningful\". Metaphysics, ontology, as well as much of ethics failed this criterion, and so were found \"cognitively meaningless\". Moritz Schlick, however, did not view ethical or aesthetic statements as cognitively meaningless. \"Cognitive meaningfulness\" was variously defined: having a truth value; corresponding to a possible state of affairs; intelligible or understandable as are scientific statements.\n\nEthics and aesthetics were subjective preferences, while theology and other metaphysics contained \"pseudostatements\", neither true nor false. This meaningfulness was cognitive, although other types of meaningfulness—for instance, emotive, expressive, or figurative—occurred in metaphysical discourse, dismissed from further review. Thus, logical positivism indirectly asserted Hume's law, the principle that \"is\" statements cannot justify \"ought\" statements, but are separated by an unbridgeable gap. A. J. Ayer's 1936 book asserted an extreme variant—the boo/hooray doctrine—whereby all evaluative judgments are but emotional reactions.\n\nIn an important pair of papers in 1936 and 1937, \"Testability and meaning\", Carnap replaced \"verification\" with \"confirmation\", on the view that although universal laws cannot be verified they can be confirmed. Later, Carnap employed abundant logical and mathematical methods in researching inductive logic while seeking to provide an account of probability as \"degree of confirmation\", but was never able to formulate a model. In Carnap's inductive logic, every universal law's degree of confirmation is always zero. In any event, the precise formulation of what came to be called the \"criterion of cognitive significance\" took three decades (Hempel 1950, Carnap 1956, Carnap 1961).\n\nCarl Hempel became a major critic within the logical positivism movement. Hempel elucidated the paradox of confirmation.\n\nThe second edition of A. J. Ayer's book arrived in 1946, and discerned \"strong\" versus \"weak\" forms of verification. Ayer concluded, \"A proposition is said to be verifiable, in the strong sense of the term, if, and only if, its truth could be conclusively established by experience\", but is verifiable in the weak sense \"if it is possible for experience to render it probable\". And yet, \"no proposition, other than a tautology, can possibly be anything more than a probable hypothesis\". Thus, all are open to weak verification.\n\nUpon the global defeat of Nazism, and the removal from philosophy of rivals for radical reform—Marburg neo-Kantianism, Husserlian phenomenology, Heidegger's \"existential hermeneutics\"—and while hosted in the climate of American pragmatism and commonsense empiricism, the neopositivists shed much of their earlier, revolutionary zeal. No longer crusading to revise traditional philosophy into a new \"scientific philosophy\", they became respectable members of a new philosophy subdiscipline, \"philosophy of science\". Receiving support from Ernest Nagel, logical empiricists were especially influential in the social sciences.\n\nComtean positivism had viewed science as \"description\", whereas the logical positivists posed science as \"explanation\", perhaps to better realize the envisioned unity of science by covering not only fundamental science—that is, fundamental physics—but the special sciences, too, for instance biology, anthropology, psychology, sociology, and economics. The most widely accepted concept of scientific explanation, held even by neopositivist critic Karl Popper, was the deductive-nomological model (DN model). Yet DN model received its greatest explication by Carl Hempel, first in his 1942 article \"The function of general laws in history\", and more explicitly with Paul Oppenheim in their 1948 article \"Studies in the logic of explanation\".\n\nIn the DN model, the stated phenomenon to be explained is the \"explanandum\"—which can be an event, law, or theory—whereas premises stated to explain it are the \"explanans\". Explanans must be true or highly confirmed, contain at least one law, and entail the explanandum. Thus, given initial conditions \"C, C . . . C\" plus general laws \"L, L . . . L\", event \"E\" is a deductive consequence and scientifically explained. In the DN model, a law is an unrestricted generalization by conditional proposition—\"If A, then B\"—and has empirical content testable. (Differing from a merely true regularity—for instance, \"George always carries only $1 bills in his wallet\"—a law suggests what \"must\" be true, and is consequent of a scientific theory's axiomatic structure.)\n\nBy the Humean empiricist view that humans observe sequences of events, (not cause and effect, as causality and causal mechanisms are unobservable), the DN model neglects causality beyond mere constant conjunction, first event \"A\" and then always event \"B\". Hempel's explication of the DN model held natural laws—empirically confirmed regularities—as satisfactory and, if formulated realistically, approximating causal explanation. In later articles, Hempel defended the DN model and proposed a probabilistic explanation, inductive-statistical model (IS model). the DN and IS models together form the \"covering law model\", as named by a critic, William Dray. (Derivation of statistical laws from other statistical laws goes to deductive-statistical model (DS model).) Georg Henrik von Wright, another critic, named it \"subsumption theory\", fitting the ambition of theory reduction.\n\nLogical positivists were generally committed to \"Unified Science\", and sought a common language or, in Neurath's phrase, a \"universal slang\" whereby all scientific propositions could be expressed. The adequacy of proposals or fragments of proposals for such a language was often asserted on the basis of various \"reductions\" or \"explications\" of the terms of one special science to the terms of another, putatively more fundamental. Sometimes these reductions consisted of set-theoretic manipulations of a few logically primitive concepts (as in Carnap's \"Logical Structure of the World\" (1928)). Sometimes, these reductions consisted of allegedly analytic or \"a priori\" deductive relationships (as in Carnap's \"Testability and meaning\"). A number of publications over a period of thirty years would attempt to elucidate this concept.\n\nAs in Comtean positivism's envisioned unity of science, neopositivists aimed to network all special sciences through the covering law model of scientific explanation. And ultimately, by supplying boundary conditions and supplying bridge laws within the covering law model, all the special sciences' laws would reduce to fundamental physics, the fundamental science.\n\nAfter World War II, key tenets of logical positivism, including its atomistic philosophy of science, the verifiability principle, and the fact/value gap, drew escalated criticism. It was clear that empirical claims cannot be verified to be universally true. Thus, as initially stated, the verifiability criterion made universal statements meaningless, and even made statements beyond empiricism for technological but not conceptual reasons meaningless, which would pose significant problems for science. These problems were recognized within the movement, which hosted attempted solutions—Carnap's move to \"confirmation\", Ayer's acceptance of \"weak verification\"—but the program drew sustained criticism from a number of directions by the 1950s. Even philosophers disagreeing among themselves on which direction general epistemology ought to take, as well as on philosophy of science, agreed that the logical empiricist program was untenable, and it became viewed as self-contradictory. The verifiability criterion of meaning was itself unverified. Notable critics included Nelson Goodman, Willard Van Orman Quine, Norwood Hanson, Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, J L Austin, Peter Strawson, Hilary Putnam, and Richard Rorty.\n\nAlthough quite empiricist, American logician Willard Van Orman Quine published the 1951 paper \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\", which challenged conventional empiricist presumptions. Quine attacked the analytic/synthetic division, which the verificationist program had been hinged upon in order to entail, by consequence of Hume's fork, both necessity and apriocity. Quine's ontological relativity explained that every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world. Quine later proposed naturalized epistemology.\n\nIn 1958, Norwood Hanson's \"Patterns of Discovery\" undermined the division of observation versus theory, as one can predict, collect, prioritize, and assess data only via some horizon of expectation set by a theory. Thus, any dataset—the direct observations, the scientific facts—is laden with theory.\n\nAn early, tenacious critic was Karl Popper whose 1934 book \"Logik der Forschung\", arriving in English in 1959 as \"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\", directly answered verificationism. Popper heeded the problem of induction as rendering empirical verification logically impossible, and the deductive fallacy of affirming the consequent reveals any phenomenon's capacity to host more than one logically possible explanation. Accepting scientific method as hypotheticodeduction, whose inference form is denying the consequent, Popper finds scientific method unable to proceed without falsifiable predictions. Popper thus identifies falsifiability to demarcate not \"meaningful\" from \"meaningless\" but simply \"scientific\" from \"unscientific\"—a label not in itself unfavorable.\n\nPopper finds virtue in metaphysics, required to develop new scientific theories. And an unfalsifiable—thus unscientific, perhaps metaphysical—concept in one era can later, through evolving knowledge or technology, become falsifiable, thus scientific. Popper also found science's quest for truth to rest on values. Popper disparages the \"pseudoscientific\", which occurs when an unscientific theory is proclaimed true and coupled with seemingly scientific method by \"testing\" the unfalsifiable theory—whose predictions are confirmed by necessity—or when a scientific theory's falsifiable predictions are strongly falsified but the theory is persistently protected by \"immunizing stratagems\", such as the appendage of \"ad hoc\" clauses saving the theory or the recourse to increasingly speculative hypotheses shielding the theory.\n\nPopper's \"scientific\" epistemology is falsificationism, which finds that no number, degree, and variety of empirical successes can either verify or confirm scientific theory. Falsificationism finds science's aim as \"corroboration\" of scientific theory, which strives for scientific realism but accepts the maximal status of strongly corroborated verisimilitude (\"truthlikeness\"). Explicitly denying the positivist view that all knowledge is scientific, Popper developed the \"general\" epistemology critical rationalism, which finds human knowledge to evolve by \"conjectures and refutations\". Popper thus acknowledged the value of the positivist movement, driving evolution of human understanding, but claimed that he had \"killed positivism\".\n\nWith his landmark, \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (1962), Thomas Kuhn critically destabilized the verificationist program, which was presumed to call for foundationalism. (Actually, even in the 1930s, Otto Neurath had argued for nonfoundationalism via coherentism by likening science to a boat (Neurath's boat) that scientists must rebuild at sea.) Although Kuhn's thesis itself was attacked even by opponents of neopositivism, in the 1970 postscript to \"Structure\", Kuhn asserted, at least, that there was no algorithm to science—and, on that, even most of Kuhn's critics agreed.\n\nPowerful and persuasive, Kuhn's book, unlike the vocabulary and symbols of logic's formal language, was written in natural language open to the layperson. Ironically, Kuhn's book was first published in a volume of \"Encyclopedia of Unified Science\"—a project begun by logical positivists—and some sense unified science, indeed, but by bringing it into the realm of historical and social assessment, rather than fitting it to the model of physics. Kuhn's ideas were rapidly adopted by scholars in disciplines well outside natural sciences, and, as logical empiricists were extremely influential in the social sciences, ushered academia into postpositivism or postempiricism.\n\nThe \"received view\" operates on the \"correspondence rule\" that states, \"The observational terms are taken as referring to specified phenomena or phenomenal properties, and the only interpretation given to the theoretical terms is their explicit definition provided by the correspondence rules\". According to Hilary Putnam, a former student of Reichenbach and of Carnap, the dichotomy of observational terms versus theoretical terms introduced a problem within scientific discussion that was nonexistent until this dichotomy was stated by logical positivists. Putnam's four objections:\n\n\nPutnam also alleged that positivism was actually a form of metaphysical idealism by its rejecting scientific theory's ability to garner knowledge about nature's unobservable aspects. With his \"no miracles\" argument, posed in 1974, Putnam asserted scientific realism, the stance that science achieves true—or approximately true—knowledge of the world as it exists independently of humans' sensory experience. In this, Putnam opposed not only the positivism but other instrumentalism—whereby scientific theory is but a human tool to predict human observations—filling the void left by positivism's decline.\n\nBy the late 1960s, logical positivism had become exhausted. Interviewed in the late 1970s, A. J. Ayer supposed that \"the most important\" defect \"was that nearly all of it was false\". After some laughter, he says that \"it was true in spirit.\" Although logical positivism tends to be recalled as a pillar of scientism, Carl Hempel was key in establishing the philosophy subdiscipline philosophy of science where Thomas Kuhn and Karl Popper brought in the era of postpositivism. John Passmore found logical positivism to be \"dead, or as dead as a philosophical movement ever becomes\".\n\nLogical positivism's fall reopened debate over the metaphysical merit of scientific theory, whether it can offer knowledge of the world beyond human experience (scientific realism) versus whether it is but a human tool to predict human experience (instrumentalism). Meanwhile, it became popular among philosophers to rehash the faults and failures of logical positivism without investigation of it. Thereby, logical positivism has been generally misrepresented, sometimes severely. Arguing for their own views, often framed versus logical positivism, many philosophers have reduced logical positivism to simplisms and stereotypes, especially the notion of logical positivism as a type of foundationalism. In any event, the movement helped anchor analytic philosophy in the English-speaking world, and returned Britain to empiricism. Without the logical positivists, who have been tremendously influential outside philosophy, especially in psychology and social sciences, intellectual life of the 20th century would be unrecognizable.\n\n\n\n\nArticles by logical positivists\n\nArticles on logical positivism\n\nArticles on related philosophical topics\n"}

{"id": "77260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77260", "title": "Olmecs", "text": "Olmecs\n\nThe Olmecs () were the earliest known major civilization in Mesoamerica following a progressive development in Soconusco. They lived in the tropical lowlands of south-central Mexico, in the present-day states of Veracruz and Tabasco. It has been speculated that the Olmecs derive in part from neighboring Mokaya or Mixe–Zoque.\n\nThe Olmecs flourished during Mesoamerica's formative period, dating roughly from as early as 1500 BCE to about 400 BCE. Pre-Olmec cultures had flourished in the area since about 2500 BCE, but by 1600–1500 BCE, early Olmec culture had emerged, centered on the San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán site near the coast in southeast Veracruz. They were the first Mesoamerican civilization, and laid many of the foundations for the civilizations that followed. Among other \"firsts\", the Olmec appeared to practice ritual bloodletting and played the Mesoamerican ballgame, hallmarks of nearly all subsequent Mesoamerican societies. The aspect of the Olmecs most familiar now is their artwork, particularly the aptly named \"colossal heads\". The Olmec civilization was first defined through artifacts which collectors purchased on the pre-Columbian art market in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Olmec artworks are considered among ancient America's most striking.\n\nThe name 'Olmec' comes from the Nahuatl word for the Olmecs: \"Ōlmēcatl\" (singular) or \"Ōlmēcah\" (plural). This word is composed of the two words \"ōlli\" , meaning \"rubber\", and \"mēcatl\" , meaning \"people\", so the word means \"rubber people\".\n\nThe Olmec heartland is the area in the Gulf lowlands where it expanded after early development in Soconusco, Veracruz. This area is characterized by swampy lowlands punctuated by low hills, ridges, and volcanoes. The Tuxtlas Mountains rise sharply in the north, along the Gulf of Mexico's Bay of Campeche. Here, the Olmec constructed permanent city-temple complexes at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, La Venta, Tres Zapotes, and Laguna de los Cerros. In this region, the first Mesoamerican civilization emerged and reigned from 1400–400 BCE.\n\nThe beginnings of Olmec civilization have traditionally been placed between 1400 and 1200 BCE. Past finds of Olmec remains ritually deposited at El Manati shrine (near San Lorenzo) moved this back to \"at least\" 1600–1500 BCE. It seems that the Olmec had their roots in early farming cultures of Tabasco, which began between 5100 BCE and 4600 BCE. These shared the same basic food crops and technologies of the later Olmec civilization.\n\nWhat is today called Olmec first appeared fully within the city of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, where distinctive Olmec features occurred around 1400 BCE. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered alluvial soil, as well as by the transportation network provided by the Coatzacoalcos River basin. This environment may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization: the Nile, Indus, and Yellow River valleys, and Mesopotamia. This highly productive environment encouraged a densely concentrated population, which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class. The elite class created the demand for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture. Many of these luxury artifacts were made from materials such as jade, obsidian, and magnetite, which came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The source of the most valued jade was the Motagua River valley in eastern Guatemala, and Olmec obsidian has been traced to sources in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and San Martín Jilotepeque, or in Puebla, distances ranging from 200 to 400 km (120–250 miles) away, respectively.\n\nThe state of Guerrero, and in particular its early Mezcala culture, seem to have played an important role in the early history of Olmec culture. Olmec-style artifacts tend to appear earlier in some parts of Guerrero than in the Veracruz-Tabasco area. In particular, the relevant objects from the Amuco-Abelino site in Guerrero reveal dates as early as 1530 BCE. The city of Teopantecuanitlan in Guerrero is also relevant in this regard.\n\nThe first Olmec center, San Lorenzo, was all but abandoned around 900 BCE at about the same time that La Venta rose to prominence. A wholesale destruction of many San Lorenzo monuments also occurred circa 950 BCE, which may indicate an internal uprising or, less likely, an invasion. The latest thinking, however, is that environmental changes may have been responsible for this shift in Olmec centers, with certain important rivers changing course.\n\nIn any case, following the decline of San Lorenzo, La Venta became the most prominent Olmec center, lasting from 900 BCE until its abandonment around 400 BCE. La Venta sustained the Olmec cultural traditions with spectacular displays of power and wealth. The Great Pyramid was the largest Mesoamerican structure of its time. Even today, after 2500 years of erosion, it rises above the naturally flat landscape. Buried deep within La Venta lay opulent, labor-intensive \"offerings\" – 1000 tons of smooth serpentine blocks, large mosaic pavements, and at least 48 separate deposits of polished jade celts, pottery, figurines, and hematite mirrors.\n\nScholars have yet to determine the cause of the eventual extinction of the Olmec culture. Between 400 and 350 BCE, the population in the eastern half of the Olmec heartland dropped precipitously, and the area was sparsely inhabited until the 19th century. According to archaeologists, this depopulation was probably the result of \"very serious environmental changes that rendered the region unsuited for large groups of farmers\", in particular changes to the riverine environment that the Olmec depended upon for agriculture, hunting and gathering, and transportation. These changes may have been triggered by tectonic upheavals or subsidence, or the silting up of rivers due to agricultural practices.\n\nOne theory for the considerable population drop during the Terminal Formative period is suggested by Santley and colleagues (Santley et al. 1997), who propose the relocation of settlements due to volcanism, instead of extinction. Volcanic eruptions during the Early, Late and Terminal Formative periods would have blanketed the lands and forced the Olmec to move their settlements.\n\nWhatever the cause, within a few hundred years of the abandonment of the last Olmec cities, successor cultures became firmly established. The Tres Zapotes site, on the western edge of the Olmec heartland, continued to be occupied well past 400 BCE, but without the hallmarks of the Olmec culture. This post-Olmec culture, often labeled Epi-Olmec, has features similar to those found at Izapa, some 550 km (330 miles) to the southeast.\n\nThe Olmec culture was first defined as an art style, and this continues to be the hallmark of the culture. Wrought in a large number of media – jade, clay, basalt, and greenstone among others – much Olmec art, such as \"The Wrestler\", is naturalistic. Other art expresses fantastic anthropomorphic creatures, often highly stylized, using an iconography reflective of a religious meaning. Common motifs include downturned mouths and a cleft head, both of which are seen in representations of were-jaguars.\n\nIn addition to making human and human-like subjects, Olmec artisans were adept at animal portrayals; for example, the fish vessel to the right or the bird vessel in the gallery below.\n\nWhile Olmec figurines are found abundantly in sites throughout the Formative Period, the stone monuments such as the colossal heads are the most recognizable feature of Olmec culture. These monuments can be divided into four classes:\n\n\nThe most recognized aspect of the Olmec civilization are the enormous helmeted heads. As no known pre-Columbian text explains them, these impressive monuments have been the subject of much speculation. Once theorized to be ballplayers, it is now generally accepted that these heads are portraits of rulers, perhaps dressed as ballplayers. Infused with individuality, no two heads are alike and the helmet-like headdresses are adorned with distinctive elements, suggesting personal or group symbols. Some have also speculated that Mesoamerican people believed that the soul, along with all of one's experiences and emotions, was contained inside the head.\n\nSeventeen colossal heads have been unearthed to date.\n\nThe heads range in size from the Rancho La Cobata head, at high, to the pair at Tres Zapotes, at . Scholars calculate that the largest heads weigh between .\n\nThe heads were carved from single blocks or boulders of volcanic basalt, found in the Tuxtlas Mountains. The Tres Zapotes heads, for example, were sculpted from basalt found at the summit of Cerro el Vigía, at the western end of the Tuxtlas. The San Lorenzo and La Venta heads, on the other hand, were probably carved from the basalt of Cerro Cintepec, on the southeastern side, perhaps at the nearby Llano del Jicaro workshop, and dragged or floated to their final destination dozens of miles away. It has been estimated that moving a colossal head required the efforts of 1,500 people for three to four months.\n\nSome of the heads, and many other monuments, have been variously mutilated, buried and disinterred, reset in new locations and/or reburied. Some monuments, and at least two heads, were recycled or recarved, but it is not known whether this was simply due to the scarcity of stone or whether these actions had ritual or other connotations. Scholars believe that some mutilation had significance beyond mere destruction, but some scholars still do not rule out internal conflicts or, less likely, invasion as a factor.\n\nThe flat-faced, thick-lipped heads have caused some debate due to their resemblance to some African facial characteristics. Based on this comparison, some writers have said that the Olmecs were Africans who had emigrated to the New World. But, the vast majority of archaeologists and other Mesoamerican scholars reject claims of pre-Columbian contacts with Africa. Explanations for the facial features of the colossal heads include the possibility that the heads were carved in this manner due to the shallow space allowed on the basalt boulders. Others note that in addition to the broad noses and thick lips, the eyes of the heads often show the epicanthic fold, and that all these characteristics can still be found in modern Mesoamerican Indians. For instance, in the 1940s, the artist/art historian Miguel Covarrubias published a series of photos of Olmec artworks and of the faces of modern Mexican Indians with very similar facial characteristics. The African origin hypothesis assumes that Olmec carving was intended to be a representation of the inhabitants, an assumption that is hard to justify given the full corpus of representation in Olmec carving. Ivan van Sertima claimed that the seven braids on the Tres Zapotes head was an Ethiopian hair style but he offered no evidence that this was an Ethiopian hair style at the appropriate time. The Egyptologist Frank Yurco has said that the Olmec braids do not resemble contemporary Egyptian or Nubian braids.\n\nRichard Diehl wrote \"There can be no doubt that the heads depict the American Indian physical type still seen on the streets of Soteapan, Acayucan, and other towns in the region.\"\n\nAnother type of artifact is much smaller; hardstone carvings in jade of a face in a mask form. Jade is a particularly precious material, and it was used as a mark of rank by the ruling classes. By 1500 BC early Olmec sculptors mastered the human form. This can be determined by wooden Olmec sculptures discovered in the swampy bogs of El Manati. Before radiocarbon dating could tell the exact age of Olmec pieces, archaeologists and art historians noticed the unique \"Olmec-style\" in a variety of artifacts.\n\nCurators and scholars refer to \"Olmec-style\" face masks but, to date, no example has been recovered in an archaeologically controlled Olmec context. They have been recovered from sites of other cultures, including one deliberately deposited in the ceremonial precinct of Tenochtitlan (Mexico City). The mask would presumably have been about 2,000 years old when the Aztec buried it, suggesting such masks were valued and collected as were Roman antiquities in Europe. The \"Olmec-style\" refers to the combination of deep-set eyes, nostrils, and strong, slightly asymmetrical mouth. The \"Olmec-style\" also very distinctly combines facial features of both humans and jaguars. Olmec arts are strongly tied to the Olmec religion, which prominently featured Jaguars. The Olmecs believed that in the distant past a race of \"Were-Jaguars\" was made between the union of a jaguar and a woman. One ‘were-jaguar’ quality that can be found is the sharp cleft in the forehead of many supernatural beings in Olmec art. This sharp cleft is associated with the natural indented head of Jaguars.\n\nThe Kunz Axes (also known as \"Votive Axes\") are figures that represent werejaguars. In most of the cases their head represents half of their volume. While they've always been referred to as \"votive axes\", the places where they were found and when we see them, it's very clear that they're used for rituals. All of the Kunz Axes have flat noses and open mouth.\n\nOlmec-style artifacts, designs, figurines, monuments and iconography have been found in the archaeological records of sites hundreds of kilometres outside the Olmec heartland. These sites include:\n\nTlatilco and Tlapacoya, major centers of the Tlatilco culture in the Valley of Mexico, where artifacts include hollow baby-face motif figurines and Olmec designs on ceramics.\n\nChalcatzingo, in Valley of Morelos, central Mexico, which features Olmec-style monumental art and rock art with Olmec-style figures.\n\nAlso, in 2007, archaeologists unearthed Zazacatla, an Olmec-influenced city in Morelos. Located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Mexico City, Zazacatla covered about between 800 and 500 BCE.\n\nTeopantecuanitlan, in Guerrero, which features Olmec-style monumental art as well as city plans with distinctive Olmec features.\n\nAlso, the Juxtlahuaca and Oxtotitlan cave paintings feature Olmec designs and motifs.\n\nOlmec influence is also seen at several sites in the Southern Maya area.\n\nIn Guatemala, sites showing probable Olmec influence include San Bartolo, Takalik Abaj and La Democracia.\n\nMany theories have been advanced to account for the occurrence of Olmec influence far outside the heartland, including long-range trade by Olmec merchants, Olmec colonization of other regions, Olmec artisans travelling to other cities, conscious imitation of Olmec artistic styles by developing towns – some even suggest the prospect of Olmec military domination or that the Olmec iconography was actually developed outside the heartland.\n\nThe generally accepted, but by no means unanimous, interpretation is that the Olmec-style artifacts, in all sizes, became associated with elite status and were adopted by non-Olmec Formative Period chieftains in an effort to bolster their status.\n\nIn addition to their influence with contemporaneous Mesoamerican cultures, as the first civilization in Mesoamerica, the Olmecs are credited, or speculatively credited, with many \"firsts\", including the bloodletting and perhaps human sacrifice, writing and epigraphy, and the invention of popcorn, zero and the Mesoamerican calendar, and the Mesoamerican ballgame, as well as perhaps the compass. Some researchers, including artist and art historian Miguel Covarrubias, even postulate that the Olmecs formulated the forerunners of many of the later Mesoamerican deities.\n\nAlthough the archaeological record does not include explicit representation of Olmec bloodletting, researchers have found other evidence that the Olmec ritually practiced it. For example, numerous natural and ceramic stingray spikes and maguey thorns have been found at Olmec sites, and certain artifacts have been identified as bloodletters.\n\nThe argument that the Olmec instituted human sacrifice is significantly more speculative. No Olmec or Olmec-influenced sacrificial artifacts have yet been discovered; no Olmec or Olmec-influenced artwork unambiguously shows sacrificial victims (as do the \"danzante\" figures of Monte Albán) or scenes of human sacrifice (such as can be seen in from El Tajin).\n\nAt the El Manatí site, disarticulated skulls and femurs, as well as the complete skeletons of newborn or unborn children, have been discovered amidst the other offerings, leading to speculation concerning infant sacrifice. Scholars have not determined how the infants met their deaths. Some authors have associated infant sacrifice with Olmec ritual art showing limp were-jaguar babies, most famously in La Venta's Altar 5 (on the right) or Las Limas figure. Any definitive answer requires further findings.\n\nThe Olmec may have been the first civilization in the Western Hemisphere to develop a writing system. Symbols found in 2002 and 2006 date from 650 BCE and 900 BCE respectively, preceding the oldest Zapotec writing found so far, which dates from about 500 BCE.\n\nThe 2002 find at the San Andrés site shows a bird, speech scrolls, and glyphs that are similar to the later Mayan hieroglyphs. Known as the Cascajal Block, and dated between 1100 BCE and 900 BCE, the 2006 find from a site near San Lorenzo shows a set of 62 symbols, 28 of which are unique, carved on a serpentine block. A large number of prominent archaeologists have hailed this find as the \"earliest pre-Columbian writing\". Others are skeptical because of the stone's singularity, the fact that it had been removed from any archaeological context, and because it bears no apparent resemblance to any other Mesoamerican writing system.\n\nThere are also well-documented later hieroglyphs known as \"Epi-Olmec\", and while there are some who believe that Epi-Olmec may represent a transitional script between an earlier Olmec writing system and Mayan writing, the matter remains unsettled.\n\nThe Long Count calendar used by many subsequent Mesoamerican civilizations, as well as the concept of zero, may have been devised by the Olmecs. Because the six artifacts with the earliest Long Count calendar dates were all discovered outside the immediate Maya homeland, it is likely that this calendar predated the Maya and was possibly the invention of the Olmecs. Indeed, three of these six artifacts were found within the Olmec heartland. But an argument against an Olmec origin is the fact that the Olmec civilization had ended by the 4th century BCE, several centuries before the earliest known Long Count date artifact.\n\nThe Long Count calendar required the use of zero as a place-holder within its vigesimal (base-20) positional numeral system. A shell glyph – – was used as a zero symbol for these Long Count dates, the second oldest of which, on Stela C at Tres Zapotes, has a date of 32 BCE. This is one of the earliest uses of the zero concept in history.\n\nThe Olmec are strong candidates for originating the Mesoamerican ballgame so prevalent among later cultures of the region and used for recreational and religious purposes. A dozen rubber balls dating to 1600 BCE or earlier have been found in El Manatí, a bog east of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan. These balls predate the earliest ballcourt yet discovered at Paso de la Amada, circa 1400 BCE, although there is no certainty that they were used in the ballgame.\n\nWhile the actual ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Olmec remains unknown, various hypotheses have been put forward. For example, in 1968 Michael D. Coe speculated that the Olmec were Mayan predecessors.\n\nIn 1976, linguists Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman published a paper in which they argued a core number of loanwords had apparently spread from a Mixe–Zoquean language into many other Mesoamerican languages. Campbell and Kaufman proposed that the presence of these core loanwords indicated that the Olmec – generally regarded as the first \"highly civilized\" Mesoamerican society – spoke a language ancestral to Mixe–Zoquean. The spread of this vocabulary particular to their culture accompanied the diffusion of other Olmec cultural and artistic traits that appears in the archaeological record of other Mesoamerican societies.\n\nMixe–Zoque specialist Søren Wichmann first critiqued this theory on the basis that most of the Mixe–Zoquean loans seemed to originate only from the Zoquean branch of the family. This implied the loanword transmission occurred in the period \"after\" the two branches of the language family split, placing the time of the borrowings outside of the Olmec period. However, new evidence has pushed back the proposed date for the split of Mixean and Zoquean languages to a period within the Olmec era. Based on this dating, the architectural and archaeological patterns and the particulars of the vocabulary loaned to other Mesoamerican languages from Mixe–Zoquean, Wichmann now suggests that the Olmecs of San Lorenzo spoke proto-Mixe and the Olmecs of La Venta spoke proto-Zoque.\n\nAt least the fact that the Mixe–Zoquean languages are still spoken in an area corresponding roughly to the Olmec heartland, and are historically known to have been spoken there, leads most scholars to assume that the Olmec spoke one or more Mixe–Zoquean languages.\n\nOlmec religious activities were performed by a combination of rulers, full-time priests, and shamans. The rulers seem to have been the most important religious figures, with their links to the Olmec deities or supernaturals providing legitimacy for their rule. There is also considerable evidence for shamans in the Olmec archaeological record, particularly in the so-called \"transformation figures\".\n\nAs Olmec mythology has left no documents comparable to the Popul Vuh from Maya mythology, any exposition of Olmec mythology must be based on interpretations of surviving monumental and portable art (such as the Las Limas figure at right), and comparisons with other Mesoamerican mythologies. Olmec art shows that such deities as the Feathered Serpent and a rain supernatural were already in the Mesoamerican pantheon in Olmec times.\n\nLittle is directly known about the societal or political structure of Olmec society. Although it is assumed by most researchers that the colossal heads and several other sculptures represent rulers, nothing has been found like the Maya stelae () which name specific rulers and provide the dates of their rule.\n\nInstead, archaeologists relied on the data that they had, such as large- and small-scale site surveys. These provided evidence of considerable centralization within the Olmec region, first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta – no other Olmec sites come close to these in terms of area or in the quantity and quality of architecture and sculpture.\n\nThis evidence of geographic and demographic centralization leads archaeologists to propose that Olmec society itself was hierarchical, concentrated first at San Lorenzo and then at La Venta, with an elite that was able to use their control over materials such as water and monumental stone to exert command and legitimize their regime.\n\nNonetheless, Olmec society is thought to lack many of the institutions of later civilizations, such as a standing army or priestly caste. And there is no evidence that San Lorenzo or La Venta controlled, even during their heyday, all of the Olmec heartland. There is some doubt, for example, that La Venta controlled even Arroyo Sonso, only some away. Studies of the Tuxtla Mountain settlements, some away, indicate that this area was composed of more or less egalitarian communities outside the control of lowland centers.\n\nThe wide diffusion of Olmec artifacts and \"Olmecoid\" iconography throughout much of Mesoamerica indicates the existence of extensive long-distance trade networks. Exotic, prestigious and high-value materials such as greenstone and marine shell were moved in significant quantities across large distances. Some of the reasons for trade revolve around the lack of obsidian in the heartland. The Olmec used obsidian in many tools because worked edges were very sharp and durable. Most of the obsidian found has been traced back to Guatemala showing the extensive trade. While the Olmec were not the first in Mesoamerica to organize long-distance exchanges of goods, the Olmec period saw a significant expansion in interregional trade routes, more variety in material goods exchanged and a greater diversity in the sources from which the base materials were obtained.\n\nDespite their size and deliberate urban design, which was copied by other centers, San Lorenzo and La Venta were largely ceremonial centers, and the majority of the Olmec lived in villages similar to present-day villages and hamlets in Tabasco and Veracruz.\n\nThese villages were located on higher ground and consisted of several scattered houses. A modest temple may have been associated with the larger villages. The individual dwellings would consist of a house, an associated lean-to, and one or more storage pits (similar in function to a root cellar). A nearby garden was used for medicinal and cooking herbs and for smaller crops, such as the domesticated sunflower. Fruit trees, such as avocado or cacao, were probably available nearby.\n\nAlthough the river banks were used to plant crops between flooding periods, the Olmecs probably also practiced swidden (or slash-and-burn) agriculture to clear the forests and shrubs, and to provide new fields once the old fields were exhausted. Fields were located outside the village, and were used for maize, beans, squash, manioc, and sweet potato. Based on archaeological studies of two villages in the Tuxtlas Mountains, it is known that maize cultivation became increasingly important to the Olmec over time, although the diet remained fairly diverse.\n\nThe fruits and vegetables were supplemented with fish, turtle, snake, and mollusks from the nearby rivers, and crabs and shellfish in the coastal areas. Birds were available as food sources, as were game including peccary, opossum, raccoon, rabbit, and in particular, deer. Despite the wide range of hunting and fishing available, midden surveys in San Lorenzo have found that the domesticated dog was the single most plentiful source of animal protein.\n\nOlmec culture was unknown to historians until the mid-19th century. In 1869, the Mexican antiquarian traveller José Melgar y Serrano published a description of the first Olmec monument to have been found \"in situ\". This monument – the colossal head now labelled Tres Zapotes Monument A – had been discovered in the late 1850s by a farm worker clearing forested land on a \"hacienda\" in Veracruz. Hearing about the curious find while travelling through the region, Melgar y Serrano first visited the site in 1862 to see for himself and complete the partially exposed sculpture's excavation. His description of the object, published several years later after further visits to the site, represents the earliest documented report of an artifact of what is now known as the Olmec culture.\n\nIn the latter half of the 19th century, Olmec artifacts such as the Kunz Axe (right) came to light and were subsequently recognized as belonging to a unique artistic tradition.\n\nFrans Blom and Oliver La Farge made the first detailed descriptions of La Venta and San Martin Pajapan Monument 1 during their 1925 expedition. However, at this time, most archaeologists assumed the Olmec were contemporaneous with the Maya – even Blom and La Farge were, in their own words, \"inclined to ascribe them to the Maya culture\".\n\nMatthew Stirling of the Smithsonian Institution conducted the first detailed scientific excavations of Olmec sites in the 1930s and 1940s. Stirling, along with art historian Miguel Covarrubias, became convinced that the Olmec predated most other known Mesoamerican civilizations.\n\nIn counterpoint to Stirling, Covarrubias, and Alfonso Caso, however, Mayanists J. Eric Thompson and Sylvanus Morley argued for Classic-era dates for the Olmec artifacts. The question of Olmec chronology came to a head at a 1942 Tuxtla Gutierrez conference, where Alfonso Caso declared that the Olmecs were the \"mother culture\" (\"cultura madre\") of Mesoamerica.\n\nShortly after the conference, radiocarbon dating proved the antiquity of the Olmec civilization, although the \"mother culture\" question generated considerable debate even 60 years later.\n\nThe name \"Olmec\" means \"rubber people\" in Nahuatl, the language of the Aztec, and was the Aztec name for the people who lived in the Gulf Lowlands in the 15th and 16th centuries, some 2000 years after the Olmec culture died out. The term \"rubber people\" refers to the ancient practice, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, of extracting latex from \"Castilla elastica\", a rubber tree in the area. The juice of a local vine, \"Ipomoea alba,\" was then mixed with this latex to create rubber as early as 1600 BCE.\n\nEarly modern explorers and archaeologists, however, mistakenly applied the name \"Olmec\" to the rediscovered ruins and artifacts in the heartland decades before it was understood that these were not created by the people the Aztecs knew as the \"Olmec\", but rather a culture that was 2000 years older. Despite the mistaken identity, the name has stuck.\n\nIt is not known what name the ancient Olmec used for themselves; some later Mesoamerican accounts seem to refer to the ancient Olmec as \"Tamoanchan\". A contemporary term sometimes used for the Olmec culture is \"tenocelome\", meaning \"mouth of the jaguar\".\n\nPartly because the Olmecs developed the first Mesoamerican civilization, and partly because little is known of them (compared with, for example, to the Maya or Aztec), a number of Olmec alternative origin speculations have been put forth. Although several of these speculations, particularly the theory that the Olmecs were of African origin popularized by Ivan van Sertima's book \"They Came Before Columbus\", have become well-known within popular culture. They are not considered credible by the vast majority of Mesoamerican researchers and scientists, who discard it as pop-culture pseudo-science.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "53992656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53992656", "title": "Open–closed political spectrum", "text": "Open–closed political spectrum\n\nThe open–closed political spectrum, or horseshoe theory is an alternative to the standard left–right system, especially used to describe the cleavage in political systems in Europe and North America in the 21st century. In this system, parties and voters are arranged on an axis from open (socially liberal and globalist) to closed (culturally conservative and protectionist). Each side draws from both traditionally left- and right-wing ideas and values: \"closed\" parties usually hold conventionally right-wing views on social issues but may support the left-wing policies of market intervention and redistribution of wealth, while open parties can hold left-wing or progressive opinions on many issues but be staunchly in favour of the traditionally more rightist policies of free trade. Depending on context, open–closed can be a replacement to left–right or a second axis on a political compass.\n\nA political realignment along these lines across the Western world has been described by political scientists in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the Great Recession and the European migrant crisis, with mainstream left-wing and right-wing political parties shifting or falling behind populist parties and independents. Examples of votes described as having been fought on open-closed lines include the 2016 Brexit referendum, presidential elections in Austria in 2016, the United States in 2016 and France in 2017, and general elections in Poland in 2015 and the Netherlands in 2017.\n\nPrior to the development of socialism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the primary divide in British politics was between classical liberalism (Whiggism) and traditional conservatism (Toryism) as seen in debates about free trade and the Corn Laws, and James Kirkup, writing in the \"Daily Telegraph\", has suggested that the open-closed split marks a return to this era of politics. In the United States, the rise of the socially-liberal New Left and socially-conservative religious right in the 1970s, and the subsequent \"culture wars\", marked the beginning the open-closed cleavage. Fareed Zakaria, writing in the \"Washington Post\", described the Nordic model of free market social democracy as another early example of open politics. \n\nStephan Shakespeare, director of public opinion research at YouGov, identified the divide in an analysis of the party positions in the 2005 UK general election, but termed closed and open voters \"drawbridge up\" and \"drawbridge down\" respectively. The terms \"open\" and \"closed\" for this divide were first used by then-British prime minister Tony Blair in 2006, with reference to the horseshoe theory that far-left and far-right politics are similar in substance. Blair, who declared himself staunchly for \"open\", had overseen the development of the Third Way New Labour movement in 1990s and the schism in the Labour Party between \"open\" Blairites and \"closed\" traditional socialists has remained. Political analyst James Bloodworth criticised Blair's choice of terminology, describing \"closed\" as pejorative to those threatened by globalism and \"open\" as overly laudatory of the \"Davos Man\" type of globalist.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis and subsequent recession, plus the arrival of large numbers of refugees of the Syrian Civil War, populist political parties made significant gains across the European Union. In southern European countries, these tended to be anti-austerity left-wing parties such as Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain, while northern European countries saw anti-immigrant right-wing parties such as the UK Independence Party and the Alternative for Germany gain support. However all these parties shared a Eurosceptic and anti-elite viewpoint, and appealed to the \"left-behind\" who saw their livelihoods or communities as threatened by globalism and immigration. In 2015, Syriza became the largest party in the Parliament of Greece, while the right-wing populist Law and Justice became the first party since the fall of Communism to win an absolute majority in the Polish Sejm in elections the same year. At the 2016 UK EU membership referendum, the Leave option narrowly defeated the cross-party Remain option. The subsequent realignment of British politics saw the Conservatives, aligned with \"Leave\", and Liberal Democrats, aligned with \"Remain\", rise in the polls while Labour, which remained deeply divided between its open and closed wings, lost ground rapidly.\n\nSimilar political developments followed in the United States in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, liberal and pro-globalism, faced two political opponents who both represented protectionist viewpoints from opposite ends of the left–right spectrum: Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist who challenged her in the primaries, and the Republican nominee Donald Trump, running on a nativist \"America First\" platform. Trump eventually triumphed, winning several Rust Belt states from the \"Blue Wall\" of Democratic safe states which had suffered deindustrialisation and economic deprivation.\n\nWhile \"closed\" politicians scored several electoral victories, another realignment in the political centre began in Europe, as cosmopolitan pro-European voters abandoned traditional parties of government and clustered around new liberal parties and independent politicians. In the Netherlands, where the closed anti-Islam and anti-European Party for Freedom (PVV) under Geert Wilders led opinion polls for much of the previous parliament, the liberal pro-EU Democrats 66 and the green GroenLinks positioned themselves as the main open opponents of the PVV. At the 2017 elections, all three parties made significant gains at the expense of the established parties.\n\nAlexander Van der Bellen, an independent formerly of The Greens, defeated the anti-immigrant Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party of Austria in the 2016 Austrian presidential election, while Emmanuel Macron, a former member of the Socialists who described himself as \"neither left nor right\" and who founded his own party En Marche, defeated the Front National candidate Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election. In both cases, neither of the mainstream parties of left and right reached the second round of voting – instead, each election saw an open centrist independent against a closed far-right party.\n\nAlthough they can come from all sides of the left–right spectrum, closed parties share common ground on many issues, as likewise do open parties.\n\nOpposition to immigration is one of the starkest divides between open and closed parties. The closed position supports restrictions on migration, and prefers that immigrants integrate into the national culture. By contrast, the open position takes a more liberal stance on migration, and tolerates or even celebrates multiculturalism. Both left-wing and right-wing parties can be closed on the topic of immigration: the conservative Polish Law and Justice accuses immigrants of undermining Polish values and bringing in terrorists, while the socialist German Left Party considers immigrants a drain on the welfare state. Conversely, in the United Kingdom for example the Adam Smith Institute (a neoliberal right-wing organisation) and Vince Cable (a left-wing social democrat and former business secretary) stand together as some of the strongest defenders of immigration.\n\nIssues of international trade and international cooperation are another significant line of division between the two camps. In the open ideology, free trade and globalism is a net good, strengthening the national economy and providing jobs while cutting prices. In the closed ideology, free trade is detrimental to the national economy and encourages companies to offshore industries, resulting in lower wages and higher unemployment, as well as potentially threatening national culture. The closed attitude to globalism manifests in opposition to trade agreements such as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, to military alliances such as NATO, and to supranational unions such as the EU, which are generally supported by the open side.\n\nPro-closed politicians opposing free trade and immigration usually describe these as impositions from an existing political elite, either within the country or outside its borders, and campaign on an anti-establishment platform. In the most extreme case, this can cross over into conspiracism, alleging that shadowy figures are actively trying to harm the nation.\n\nIdentity politics plays a role in forming both the open and closed coalitions. Pro-closed voters tend to have a strong sense of national identity, while pro-open ones share a more cosmopolitan identity. This does not mean that all closed voters are racist, nor that all open voters are unpatriotic. Nationalist pride can be enhanced by the arrival of newcomers, if these assimilate to the national culture quickly. Conversely some open politicians, such as Jesse Klaver, leader of GroenLinks, and Emmanuel Macron, have succeeded in developing a patriotic alternative to nationalism in which tolerance and cooperation are themselves considered national values to be prized and protected.\n\nPolitical scientists have identified several lines of cleavage between supporters of open and closed parties. Educational attainment was the strongest predictor of voting preference in the Brexit referendum and the 2016/2017 US, Dutch and French elections: in each case, those with low educational achievement were more likely to vote for the closed or populist option. This was described by the BBC as \"one of the most remarkable features of the US election\", as the Republican party usually performs well among university graduates.\n\nIncome has been suggested as another dividing line: in the EU referendum, the bottom fifth of UK earners overwhelmingly voted for Brexit (68% Leave, 32% Remain) while a large majority of the top quarter voted against Brexit (39% Leave, 61% Remain). However, Trump performed better with middle class voters than with either the highest or lowest earners and, although a small wealth effect was seen among French voters, this disappeared when controlling for education.\n\nPessimism and optimism also appear to be important psychological factors in determining whether a voter chooses an open or a closed candidate. Le Pen only took 20% of the vote of those who believed the situation would improve for the next generation, but over 40% among those who believed it would deteriorate. A majority of Leave voters agreed life in Britain is worse than it was thirty years ago, while a majority of Remain voters disagreed.\n\n"}

From 1966 to 1969 he read modern history at Balliol College, Oxford, where he was tutored by Maurice Keen and farmed out for tutorials with Michael Wallace-Hadrill (at that time a Senior Research Fellow at Merton College, Oxford) and Peter Brown (at that time a research fellow at All Souls College, Oxford). Wormald's potential was subsequently recognised by both Merton and All Souls when those colleges awarded him, respectively, the Harmsworth Senior Scholarship and a seven-year Prize Fellowship.\n\nWormald taught early medieval history at the University of Glasgow from 1974 to 1988, where his lectures drew huge enthusiasm from students. There he also met and married fellow-historian Jenny Brown. They had two sons, but their marriage was dissolved in 2001. While at Glasgow, he became a participant in the Bucknell Group of early medievalists, hosted by Wendy Davies – the group taking its name from a village on the Welsh-English border where it often met. He delivered the Jarrow Lecture in 1984.\n\nFollowing a British Academy Research Readership (1987–89), Wormald returned to Oxford in 1989 as a college lecturer at Christ Church, where he was then appointed a fellow and university lecturer from 1990, tutoring students in medieval history. He delivered the Deerhurst Lecture in 1991 and the British Academy's Raleigh Lecture in History in 1995. In 1996 he gave the inaugural Richard Rawlinson Center Congress Lecture at the 31st International Congress on Medieval Studies in Kalamazoo. His greatest work, which took many years to produce, was \"The Making of English Law\", the first volume of which was published in 1999. Volume II was unfinished at the time of his death, although his extensive preparatory papers for the book have now been published online. Following his early retirement from Christ Church in 2001, he was re-engaged as a lecturer by the History Faculty at Oxford and entered Wolfson College. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 2003, and that year also delivered the Brixworth Lecture.\n\nIn 2009, a collection of essays written by leading scholars in Wormald's honour was published under the title \"Early Medieval Studies in Memory of Patrick Wormald\", edited by Stephen Baxter et al.

{"id": "165893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165893", "title": "Semi-direct democracy", "text": "Semi-direct democracy\n\nSemi-direct democracy is a type of democracy that combines the mechanisms of direct democracy and representative government. In semi-direct democracy, representatives administer daily governance, but citizens keep the sovereignty, being able to control their governments and laws through different forms of popular action: binding referendum, popular initiative, revocation of mandate, plebiscites, and public consultations. The first two forms—referendums and initiatives—are examples of direct legislation.\n\nModern-era citizen lawmaking began in the towns of Switzerland in the 13th century. In 1847, the Swiss added the \"statute referendum\" to their national constitution. They soon discovered that merely having the power to veto Parliament's laws was not enough. In 1891, they added the \"constitutional amendment initiative\". Swiss politics since 1891 have given the world a valuable experience base with the national-level constitutional amendment initiative. In the past 120 years, more than 240 initiatives have been put to referendums. The populace has been conservative, approving only about 10% of these initiatives; in addition, they have often opted for a version of the initiative rewritten by government.\n\nA government is elected, but unlike the representative system, there are binding mechanisms of control, where the people take power and can veto laws of parliament, or propose new laws, which will subsequently be subject to a binding referendum. These mechanisms are the binding referendum and the popular legislative initiative. There are other mechanisms such as the revocation of the mandate, the avocation and the plebiscite. The main countries of application are Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n\nThe pure form of direct democracy exists only in the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus. The Swiss Confederation is a semi-direct democracy (representative democracy with strong instruments of direct democracy). The nature of direct democracy in Switzerland is fundamentally complemented by its federal governmental structures (in German also called the ).\n\nMost western countries have representative systems. Switzerland is a rare example of a country with instruments of direct democracy (at the levels of the municipalities, cantons, and federal state). Citizens have more power than in a representative democracy. On any political level citizens can propose changes to the constitution (popular initiative), or ask for an optional referendum to be held on any law voted by the federal, cantonal parliament and/or municipal legislative body.\n\nThe list for mandatory or optional referendums on each political level are generally much longer in Switzerland than in any other country; for example any amendment to the constitution must automatically be voted on by the Swiss electorate and cantons, on cantonal/communal levels often any financial decision of a certain substantial amount decreed by legislative and/or executive bodies as well.\n\nSwiss citizens vote regularly on any kind of issue on every political level, such as financial approvals of a school house or the building of a new street, or the change of the policy regarding sexual work, or on constitutional changes, or on the foreign policy of Switzerland, four times a year. Between January 1995 and June 2005, Swiss citizens voted 31 times, on 103 federal questions besides many more cantonal and municipal questions. During the same period, French citizens participated in only two referendums.\n\nIn Switzerland, simple majorities are sufficient at the municipal and cantonal level, but at the federal level double majorities are required on constitutional issues.\n\nA double majority requires approval by a majority of individuals voting, and also by a majority of cantons. Thus, in Switzerland a citizen-proposed amendment to the federal constitution (i.e. popular initiative) cannot be passed at the federal level if a majority of the people approve but a majority of the cantons disapprove. For referendums or propositions in general terms (like the general revision of the Constitution), a majority of those voting is sufficient (Swiss Constitution, 2005).\n\nIn 1890, when the provisions for Swiss national citizen lawmaking were being debated by civil society and government, the Swiss adopted the idea of double majorities from the United States Congress, in which House votes were to represent the people and Senate votes were to represent the states. According to its supporters, this \"legitimacy-rich\" approach to national citizen lawmaking has been very successful. Kris Kobach claims that Switzerland has had tandem successes both socially and economically which are matched by only a few other nations. Kobach states at the end of his book, \"Too often, observers deem Switzerland an oddity among political systems. It is more appropriate to regard it as a pioneer.\" Finally, the Swiss political system, including its direct democratic devices in a multi-level governance context, becomes increasingly interesting for scholars of European Union integration.\n\nCalifornia has a form of semi-direct democracy where citizens can start the referendum process if they are able to gather enough petition signatures. If enough petition signatures are gathered then the entire state's electorate can vote to approve or disapprove of the ballot measure.\n\n"}

Once a traditional agricultural county, it has become one of the most affluent counties in Guangdong and mainland China. Since 2009, it is administrated independently of Foshan city, answerable directly to the Guangdong provincial government.\n\nShunde was a county-level city until 8 December 2002, when it became a district of Foshan prefecture-level city. Shunde has direct jurisdiction over four subdistricts and six towns:\n\nUnique as a district of any prefecture-level city in China, Shunde has been granted a degree of prefecture-level administrative autonomy over certain matters, notably economic development, independent of Foshan city, and has been answerable directly to the Guangdong Provincial government since 2009.\n\nSituated in the fertile Pearl River Delta, its economy was once dominated by agriculture, fisheries and silk farming. Since the implementation of policies related to reform and openness began in 1978, the people of this area were given full control over their geographical position and culture. This has allowed Shunde to gradually develop into a modern industrial boomtown, especially the manufacturing of furniture and electric appliances. Some mainland Chinese product brands like Kelon or Midea are made in Shunde. Recently a new technology industrial park has also been opened in this area, featuring car manufacturers such as Toyota. Galanz, an appliance maker, has its headquarters in Shunde District.\n\nShunde was approved as a pilot city for the comprehensive reform of Guangdong in 1993, and also for taking the lead in accomplishing modernization in 1999. From 2000 to 2003, Shunde was ranked first among China's top 100 counties for Basic Economic Competitiveness for four consecutive years (released by National Bureau of Statistics of China). In 2005, Shunde's GDP was 2,170 billion yuan.\n\nToday, this area has become one of the most affluent counties in Guangdong and mainland China (according to official information from the Chinese government and the United Nations). The GDP reached 127.5 billion yuan in 2007, an annual increase of 18%, and GDP per capita reached 107,991 yuan (ca. US$14,200).\n\nTourist attractions include the Qinghui Garden, which features fish ponds surrounded by osmanthus, bamboo and mulberry bushes, as well as the Bruce Lee Memorial Museum located in Jun'an. Shunfengshan Park was opened to the public in 2004 and has a memorial archway which is wide and high. Baolin Temple is accessible through the park.\n\nTravelling from Shunde is easy with many different options. There are ferries and buses that go directly to Hong Kong, including an option to Hong Kong International Airport. Bus tickets can be purchased at the New World Centre Hotel. Macau is easily accessible by train, taking less than an hour. Guangzhou is accessible by train, taxi or bus.\n\nChina’s southern city of Shunde joined the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as the city of gastronomy on Monday. Another 27 cities from 19 countries were also added to the list.\n\nShunde has long been widely regarded as the basis for exquisite Cantonese cuisine and the cradle of Cantonese cuisine chefs. While the cuisine of Guangzhou has been historically very minimalist in terms of flavorings, food from Shunde is known for its liberal use of ingredients such as sun dried tangerine peel and dates, resulting in simple but powerful flavors.\n\nLaunched in 2004, the UNESCO Creative Cities Network is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. The network aims to foster international cooperation between cities committed to investing in creativity as a driver for sustainable urban development, social inclusion and enhanced cultural influence in the world.\n\nBy joining the network, cities commit to collaborate and develop partnerships with a view to promoting creativity and cultural industries, to share best practices, to strengthen participation in cultural life and to integrate culture in economic and social development plans.\n\nThe network covers seven thematic areas: craft and folk arts, design, film, gastronomy, Literature, media arts and music. It aims to promote international cooperation and encourage the sharing of experiences and resources to promote local development through culture and creativity.\n\nWith these new designations, the number of UNESCO Creative Cities Network members now totals 69.\n\nShunde is one of the cradles of Cantonese cuisine, situated at the core of the Pearl River Delta, with Guangzhou to the north and Hong Kong to the south. Its outstanding natural environment, lively cultural scene, prosperous economy and renowned culinary arts academies provide particularly favorable conditions for the development of a gastronomic culture and industry.\n\nThe chefs in the city pay special attention to retaining the ingredients’ flavors and cook with attractive colors, fragrances and tastes that can be described as \"light, fresh, crispy, tender, smooth and genuine\". Shunde cuisine is famous for its delicacies characterized by their nutritional value and preparation. The combination of inventive cooking methods, creative ways of presentation and outstanding flavors, make the city’s cuisine truly exceptional.\n\nShunde’s longstanding and well-developed gastronomy as well as more recent processes of industrialization have brought forth ambitions for future developments. The city is determined to further its image as an innovative city of gastronomy and creativity.\n\nAn unusual feature of Shunde cuisine is its desserts, such as double skin milk, made with dairy products - otherwise rare in Chinese cuisine - an indirect legacy of European missionaries and merchants active in the area since the 16th Century.\n\nAs of 2017 there are 18 cities in the world which have been awarded the UNESCO \"City of Gastronomy\", of which Shunde is one of two in China (the other being Chengdu).\n\nMartial artist Bruce Lee's ancestral roots are traced to Gwan'on (Jun'an) in Seundak (Shunde).

These flower festivals are unique to St. Lucia and are major events in the cultural life and history of the country.\n\nThe names \"La Woz\" and \"La Magawit\" are in the local Creole (Kweyol) language, that combines a European vocabulary with a West African based grammar.\n\nThe societies originated in the time of slavery as co-operative work groups created for mutual support, and assistance in time of trouble. These groups were similar to the \"dokpwé\" of Dahomey, and the \"coumbite\" of Haiti. They also had a great deal in common with the famed \"egbes\" of the Yoruba peoples, which were and still are presided over by the tribe's various chieftains through the framework of what is essentially a highly elaborate series of West African theatre states.\n\nFurthermore, the two societies were vaguely inspired by two mystic orders that were active at the time in Europe, Rosicrucianism and Freemasonry. This connection is depicted in a mural painted by Dunstan St. Omer, which shows the holy trinity of Osiris, Horus and Isis.\n\nIn former years the St Lucian society was split in affiliation to one or the other group. At times membership has been illegal, and it has also been condemned by the Roman Catholic Church. Nevertheless the societies survived, although their nature has changed through the centuries. As the general society changed, so did the \"sociétés\", becoming more commercial and money-oriented. In time, other organisations were created for money saving and social security. Nowadays, the two historical \"societés\" are largely devoted to solidarity through recreation.\n\nAt the time of Saint Lucia's Independence, when the national symbols – tree, bird, flower etc. – were being defined, St Lucia chose to have two flowers, a rose and a marguerite.\n\nBoth societies have a formal hierarchic structure patterned upon the socio-economic structure of colonial society. Each society has a king and a queen, as well as princes, princesses, and many other symbolic legal, military and professional roles, such as judges, policemen, nurses, soldiers.\n\nPreparations for the yearly festivals begin several months before the actual feast day. Each group holds \"seances\". These consist of all night singing and dancing sessions where drinks are sold and games are played.\n\nThe central figure at the \"seances\" is the \"shatwel\" or leadsinger who sustains the spirit and tenor of the entertainment. Most groups have one outstanding \"shatwel\". They are usually female.\n\nOn the actual day of the festival all members of the society dress in the finery of their respective roles and march to Church for a service which precedes their parade through the streets before returning to the hall for their feasting or \"grande fete\".\n\n"}

{"id": "49102366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49102366", "title": "The Light Princess (musical)", "text": "The Light Princess (musical)\n\nThe Light Princess is a musical by Tori Amos and Samuel Adamson. Based on the Scottish fairy tale by George MacDonald, it tells the story of a princess afflicted by a constant weightlessness, unable to get her feet on the ground, both literally and metaphorically, until she finds a love that brings her down to earth. The musical was premiered for the Royal National Theatre in London in 2013. The stage production featured actress Rosalie Craig as the titular character. The musical was generally well-received, enjoyed an extended run in the theatre, and released its cast recording in 2015.\n\nIn 2013, the National Theatre produced a musical staging of the story. It is adapted by Samuel Adamson; directed by Marianne Elliott, winner of the Tony Award for Best Directing in 2011, and has music and lyrics by Tori Amos.\nIt was expected to premiere in London in April 2012, but The National Theatre announced in October 2011 that the production would be delayed until later in the year.\n\nThe musical opened to positive reviews in September 2013, starring Rosalie Craig in the titular role, subsequently singled out as a stand-out performance. Craig was nominated for many awards, and ultimately won the Evening Standard's award for best actress in a musical. The choreography, lighting, set design, music (Amos) and other cast performances were also lauded and nominated for a range of awards. In 2014, Amos stated that the production team had ambitions of bringing \"The Light Princess\" to American Broadway, but expressed worry that the original National Theatre production might not be commercial enough for the American audience.\n\nOn creating the musical, Amos stated:\n\n\"It wasn’t commercial theater, so from the top down they (the National Theatre) said to us, do not dumb this down. You be brave, you be bold, you be confrontational. Sam and I said, well, this is a feminist fairy tale, and not everyone will be comfortable with it. It’s not always going to make everyone feel warm and fuzzy. It brings up confrontations between teenagers and their parents, that would resonate in the 21st century [...] The Light Princess has to be something that kids can come see, because it is a story of a teenage girl. It might be a little dark for some. But we found that there were kids that were completely entranced. And even though sometimes it got scary, they stayed with the story.\"\n\nSelected tracks from the musical is available for streaming from the National Theatre, including \"My Fairy Story\", \"Althea\", \"Amphibiava\" and \"Better Than Good\".\n\nAnother stage adaption was done to the fairy tale by a Massachusetts director, Emily C. A. Snyder.\n\nOn 1st July 2018 Alex Parker and Club 11 staged a concert performance of the musical at Cadogan Hall in London. It starred Rosalie Craig returning to the role of Althea, Craig's husband Hadley Fraser as Prince Digby, Trevor Dion Nicholas as King Darius, Gabrielle Brooks as Piper, Louis Maskell as Llewelyn, Norman Bowman as King Ignacio, Anna-Jane Casey as Sergeant at Arms, Laura Pitt-Pulford as Falconer and David Langham as Mr Flowers. Both Tori Amos and Samuel Anderson attended the concert who both joined in the rapturous standing ovation at the end of the performance. \n\nIn the middle of a desert lies the kingdom of Lagobel, which owes its wealth to gold buried in its native sands. The kind king and queen have two children, eldest son Alexander and daughter Althea. When the queen dies, the kingdom is plunged into a tearful sorrow, all except the princess Althea, who instead chooses to reject sadness, instead floating into the air, above emotion and responsibility, seemingly without any influence from gravitational forces. Her father descends into cold-heartedness, locking her in a tower with the orphan Piper.\n\nEast of Lagobel, across a vast wooded wilderness, lies Sealand, a kingdom rich in natural resources, most notably a healthy network of rivers. The queen dies mysteriously shortly after questioning the greedy king. The land dares not weep, fearing the king's wrath. The prince Digby, however, did not smile after the incident, adopting the moniker 'Solemn Prince of Sealand'. He grows up to be a proud and dutiful warrior.\n\nThe day of Digby's coming of age, Prince Alexander of Lagobel was killed by a Sealand assassin, and Sealand declares war on Lagobel, with sights aimed upon the vast riches of their Western neighbor. Upon the realization of Althea's impending ascent to the throne, the king of Lagobel urges her to take up her familial duty of leading Lagobel's army against the incoming siege from Sealand. Althea laughs off her father's requests, instead fleeing to the wilderness to find her own sanctuary. She comes across a secret lake, the source of Lagobel's limited water supply. She hears about the slaughter of the Lagobel army at the hands of the Sealand force.\n\nAt the lake she comes across Prince Digby, who teases her about her lack of gravity, and realizes the value of the lake upon which Lagobel depends for life. His conversation with Althea fills Digby with mirth, prompting his first smile since his childhood. He falls in love with Althea, and she for him, engaging in a joyous dance in the forest.\n\nBack in Lagobel, rumors of the princess's actions in the forests fill the people with distrust with the throne. The king redoubles his efforts to return Althea to a normal state. He accepts the theory that making the princess cry will cure her. He tries arranging a marriage for her, in the hope that destroying her subsequent marriage or child will cause her to cry.\n\nAlthea escapes again to the lake, where she and Digby declare themselves queen and king of the lake, and consummate their love, conceiving a child. Digby asks Althea to return to the normal world with him, offering to build a house. Althea, preferring her watery home, asks Digby to stay. Digby heads toward Sealand, encountering his brother on the way. Digby tells Llewelyn he has killed the princess and they return to Sealand.\n\nThe king of Sealand learns of the life-giving lake and vows to dam it to choke the life out of Lagobel. Digby returns to the lake to destroy the dam, and is nearly killed. Althea witnesses this and cries for fear of his death. This returns her gravity. The two get married and live happily ever after, striking a peace between the kingdoms. Althea goes to university and becomes a marine biologist and appoints Piper Prime Minister.\n\nThe music was composed by Tori Amos. \n\nThe Original Cast Recording features 30 original recordings by the cast plus three bonus tracks, including two performed by Amos.\n\nThe musical numbers are as follows:\n\nThe musical received mixed but generally positive reviews, with the majority of critics praising Craig's spectacular lead performance, the strong ensemble cast, the vivid and rich set design by Rae Smith, and the elaborate, imaginative choreography used to create the illusion of Althea floating in air. The script by Adamson and music by Amos, however, divided critics. Professional critic ratings of the musical ranged the full spectrum from 1 to 5 stars, though more often complimentary than not.\n\nMany reviewers found the musical to be a fantastic and unusual fairytale with unafraid scope and smarts. \"The Independent\" gave it a 4-star review, calling it a \"bewitchingly unusual evening walking on air\". \"Time Out\" likewise gave it 4 stars, saying it was \"a visual and technical tour de force with a title performance from Rosalie Craig that’ll blow your mind and melt your heart.\" Another 4 star review came from \"What's On Stage\", calling it an \"unusual and delightful surprise\" with an excellent ensemble led by a Craig in \"one of the most extraordinary, vocally resourceful and physically triumphant performances ever seen in musical theatre.\". \"The Evening Standard\" gave 4 stars, finding the musical \"worth the wait\" and a showcase for Amos as an artist and songwriter, with a stunningly good performance by Craig and gorgeous set design by Smith. \"Metro\" likewise gave 4 stars, with splendid music by Amos and fantastic production, but ultimately being blown away by Craig as Althea, concluding with \"a star is born.\" Simon Edge of \"The Daily Express\" gave the musical its best review, a perfect score of 5 stars, calling it a \"feast for the eyes\", with a \"staggeringly good\" lead performance by Craig, stirring and sweet music by Amos, and ultimately finding that \"this bonkers but beautiful fantasy defies categorisation\". Edge stated:\n\nOther reviewers were mixed in their critiques, most often founding the musical too unfocused, its script overtly preachy for adults, and the music not memorable enough. \"The Telegraph\" gave a 3-star review, praising Craig's performance, but finding the narrative \"preachy\" and Amos' music lacking in standout numbers. \"London Theatre\" gave another 3 stars, calling the musical \"visually ravishing\" with a brilliant cast and occasionally haunting music by Amos, but overall deeming it a \"honourable, interesting misfire\". \"The Guardian\"'s review gave the musical 2 stars, citing a lack of emotional punch, finding Amos' score sometimes bland, and Adamson's narrative too meandering. \"The Stage\" enjoyed the set production, the superb ensemble and Amos' rich music, but felt the story might fail to capture any specific audience group, being perhaps too complex for children and too earnest for adults. \"The Daily Mail\" gave the musical a scathing review of only 1 star, finding it inpersuasive and \"just silly.\". \"The Huffington Post\" concluded that its flaws \"cannot dim the magic of The Light Princess.\" \"Financial Times\" gave a 3-star review, stating that cluttered content was weighing an otherwise \"daring, beautiful and original\" musical down. \"The Arts Desk\" gave 3 stars, citing more great cheorography than real chemistry, not enjoying Amos' music and lyrics. \"Variety\" found fault with the music as well, stating a tendency to ramble, but called Craig's performance \"career-making\" and intense.\n\nA cast album of the 2013 London production was released in October 2015 by Universal/Mercury Classics. The album will be produced by songwriter and composer Tori Amos, recorded during 2014 at different stops during her Unrepentant Geraldines Tour in support of her own album. Amos' tour team, including Mark Hawley and Marcel van Limbeek, engineered the cast album throughout the tour, having recorded the orchestra in April and met up with the different cast members \"as they were available\". It will contain all 33 tracks from the show and will also feature exclusive bonus tracks sung by Amos. Amos expressed she was happy to be able to give \"The Light Princess\" a cast recording under these terms, because so many theatre musicals no longer get an album release because of the expense and logistics involved.\n\n"}
{"id": "39728690", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39728690", "title": "Think of the children", "text": "Think of the children\n\n\"Think of the children\" (also \"What about the children?\") is a cliché that evolved into a rhetorical tactic. Literally it refers to children's rights (as in discussions of child labor). In debate, however, it is a plea for pity that is used as an appeal to emotion, and therefore it becomes a logical fallacy.\n\n\"Art, Argument, and Advocacy\" (2002) argued that the appeal substitutes emotion for reason in debate. Ethicist Jack Marshall wrote in 2005 that the phrase's popularity stems from its capacity to stunt rationality, particularly discourse on morals. \"Think of the children\" has been invoked by censorship proponents to shield children from perceived danger. \"Community, Space and Online Censorship\" (2009) argued that classifying children in an infantile manner, as innocents in need of protection, is a form of obsession over the concept of purity. A 2011 article in the \"Journal for Cultural Research\" observed that the phrase grew out of a moral panic.\n\nIt was an exhortation in the 1964 Disney film \"Mary Poppins\", when the character of Mrs. Banks pleaded with her departing nanny not to quit and to \"think of the children!\" The phrase was popularized as a satiric reference on the animated television program \"The Simpsons\" in 1996, when character Helen Lovejoy pleaded \"Won't somebody please think of the children?\" during a contentious debate by citizens of the fictional town of Springfield.\n\nIn the 2012 \"Georgia State University Law Review\", Charles J. Ten Brink called Lovejoy's use of \"Think of the children\" a successful parody. The appeal's subsequent use in society was often the subject of mockery. After its popularization on \"The Simpsons\", the phrase has been called \"Lovejoy's Law\", the \"Helen Lovejoy defence\", the \"Helen Lovejoy syndrome\", and \"think-of-the-children-ism\".\n\nSociologist Joel Best wrote in 1993 that during the late 19th century, adults developed an increased concern for the welfare of children. Best noted that societies experienced decreasing birth rates after industrialization, with parents focusing their attention on fewer children. According to him, at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and children as invaluable, adorable, guiltless beings. During the 1970s and 1980s, Best wrote, adults saw children as potential victims and sought to eliminate perceived threats.\n\nIn the 1995 compilation \"Children and the Politics of Culture\", anthropologist Vivienne Wee analyzed the perception of children by adults and how it supported the concept of children's rights. Wee wrote that in this model (which she called the European pattern), children were seen as defenseless, unadulterated, and in need of protection by authoritative adults. According to Wee, this European pattern led to the idea that children required the sanctuary of the United Nations Charter and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nWee wrote: \"Alternatively, children's vulnerability could be interpreted as purity and innocence, needing the protection of responsible adults. It is this second, protective mode of interpretation that underlies the very idea of children's rights, needing the protection of a UN charter – hence the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\" She observed that the view of youth as weak and innocent focused on what might occur if children's rights were not shielded. \n\nWee argued that this behavior towards children was not entirely positive. According to her, this mindset may lead to hypocrisy by adults who assume that all their actions intended to protect children and creates the risk that adults may wield power \"for the children's own good\". Noting that adult authority may be masked as empathy, Wee concluded: \"These alternative cultural interpretations of the vulnerability of children would thus generate their own respective political and psychological consequences.\"\n\n\"Think of the children\" has been used in its literal sense to advocate for the rights of children. Early usage during the 20th century included writings in 1914 by the National Child Labor Committee criticizing child labor standards in the United States. U.S. President Bill Clinton used the phrase in a 1999 speech to the International Labour Organization, asking his audience to imagine a significant reduction in child labor: \"Think of the children ... freed of the crushing burden of dangerous and demeaning work, given back those irreplaceable hours of childhood for learning and playing and living.\"\n\nThe phrase's literal use extends into the 21st century, with Sara Boyce of the Children's Law Centre in Northern Ireland drawing on it to advocate for the legal rights of the region's children. The 2008 book \"Child Labour in a Globalized World\" used the phrase to call attention to the role of debt bondage in child labor. Sara Dillon of Suffolk University Law School used the phrase \"What about the children\" in her 2009 book, \"International Children's Rights\", to focus on child-labor program conditions. Benjamin Powell used the phrase differently in his book, \"Out of Poverty: Sweatshops in the Global Economy\", writing that in the absence of child labor some youth faced starvation. In a 2010 book on human rights, \"Children's Rights and Human Development\", child psychiatrist Bruce D. Perry used the phrase \"think of the children\" to urge clinicians to incorporate a process sensitive to developmental stages when counseling youth.\n\nIn their 2002 book, \"Art, Argument, and Advocacy: Mastering Parliamentary Debate\", John Meany and Kate Shuster called the use of the phrase \"Think of the children\" in debate a type of logical fallacy and an appeal to emotion. According to the authors, a debater may use the phrase to emotionally sway members of the audience and avoid logical discussion. They provide an example: \"I know this national missile defense plan has its detractors, but won't someone \"please\" think of the children?\" Their assessment was echoed by Margie Borschke in an article for the journal \"Media International Australia incorporating Culture and Policy\", with Borschke calling its use a rhetorical tactic.\n\nEthicist Jack Marshall described \"Think of the children!\" as a tactic used in an attempt to end discussion by invoking an unanswerable argument. According to Marshall, the strategy succeeds in preventing rational debate. He called its use an unethical manner of obfuscating debate, misdirecting empathy towards an object which may not have been the focus of the original argument. Marshall wrote that although the phrase's use may have a positive intention, it evokes irrationality when repeatedly used by both sides of a debate. He concluded that the phrase can transform the observance of regulations into an ethical quandary, cautioning society to avoid using \"Think of the children!\" as a final argument.\n\nIn his 2015 syndicated article \"Think Of The Children\", Michael Reagan criticized the phrase's use by politicians. According to Reagan, politicians needed to stop using children as tools when arguing for favored governmental programs. He called the tactic an illogical argument, an act of desperation by those who felt they had a weaker case with reason-based arguments. Noting that it has been used by Democrats and Republicans alike in the United States, Reagan called the tactic \"obvious political BS\".\n\nThe \"Journal for Cultural Research\" published an article in 2010 by Debra Ferreday, which was republished in the 2011 book \"Hope and Feminist Theory\". According to Ferreday, media use of \"Won't someone think of the children!\" had become common in a climate of moral panic. She suggested that the phrase was becoming so common that it could become another Godwin's law.\n\nIn a 2011 article for the journal \"Post Script\", Andrew Scahill wrote about the power of children in rhetoric to create an untenable stance for an opposing viewpoint. According to Scahill, an individual arguing \"for the children\" makes it extremely difficult for an opponent to hold a \"not for the children\" position. Cassandra Wilkinson discussed the impact of \"think of the children\" rhetoric in a 2011 article for \"IPA Review\". Wilkinson cited research by \"No Fear: Growing Up in a Risk-Averse Society\" author Tim Gill that hypersensitivity in defending children from potential harm has the adverse effect of contributing to the inability of youth to own their choices and react to dangerous situations. In the \"New Statesman\", Laurie Penny characterized the tactic as a political belief system and called it \"think-of-the-children-ism\".\n\nElizabeth Stoker Bruenig wrote in a 2014 article for \"First Things\" that moralizing with the phrase was commonly seen in discussions of sexuality, attributing this to society's increasing perception of morality as a feminine domain. Bruenig also cited the labeling of NBC's refusal to broadcast a movie trailer about abortion as \"think-of-the-children-ism\".\n\nScott Beattie wrote in his 2009 book, \"Community, Space and Online Censorship\", that the question \"Will no one think of the children?\" was often raised by individuals advocating censorship out of a concern that youth might view material deemed inappropriate. According to Beattie, youngsters were cast as potential casualties of online sexual predators to increase regulation of the Internet; characterizing children as infantile evoked a concept of innocence which was a form of obsession over the concept of purity.\n\nFor \"Make\" magazine, Cory Doctorow wrote in a 2011 article that \"Won't someone think of the children?!\" was used by irrational individuals to support arguments about the dangers to youth of the \"Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse\": \"pirates\", terrorists, organized crime, and child pornographers. According to Doctorow, the phrase was used to stifle discussion of underlying issues and halt rational analysis. He observed its frequent use when society was determining an appropriate approach to the legal aspects of computing.\n\nIn his 2013 book, \"Fervid Filmmaking\", Mike Watt discussed the history of censorship relative to the United Kingdom's Obscene Publications Act 1959 and noted that films banned during that period became known as \"video nasties\". Watt called a current interpretation of such censorship the \"Think of the Children\" characterization. Brian M. Reed wrote in his book, \"Nobody's Business\" (also published that year), that the phrase was devoid of substance and could be replaced for comic effect with \"How many kittens must die?\"\n\nFor \"Reason\" in 2015, journalist Brendan O'Neill wrote that Marjorie Heins' \"\" cited the centuries-long use by governments of the prevention of \"harm to minors\" as an excuse to increase censorship and control. According to O'Neill, the use of \"Won't somebody please think of the children?\" in contemporary culture had greatly increased and was a means of exerting moral authority with emotional blackmail.\n\nAccording to Kathryn Laity, early use of the phrase may have stemmed from its appearance in the 1964 Walt Disney Pictures film \"Mary Poppins\". In an opening scene, the character of Mrs. Banks pleads with her nanny not to quit by begging her to \"think of the children!\". Laity wrote that the popular use of the phrase evokes strong feelings in those who object to a nanny state, pointing out the conflict in the United States between the country's conservatism (derived from the Puritans) and its desire to use sex in advertising.\n\nIt was also used in John Huston's 1982 film \"Annie\", spoken by Eleanor Roosevelt as Annie sings \"Tomorrow\" to Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House in order to get Oliver Warbucks' begrudging support for New Deal policies he opposes.\n\n\"Think of the children\" was popularized largely by character Helen Lovejoy, wife of Reverend Lovejoy, on the television program \"The Simpsons\". Lovejoy (who first appeared in 1990) repeatedly exclaimed, \"Think of the children!\" in several episodes of the series. She first used the phrase in the episode \"Much Apu About Nothing\" by David X. Cohen, which aired in 1996, imploring the city mayor to keep bears from crossing the wildland–urban interface. Lovejoy's exhortation became increasingly overwrought with each subsequent use.\n\n\"Simpsons\" writer Bill Oakley said in the 2005 DVD commentary on the episode that the motivation for the phrase on the show was to emphasize how \"think of the children\" was used in debate; irrelevant, it sidetracked discussion from the original issues. Lovejoy used variations of the phrase, including \"Oh, won't somebody please think of the children\" and \"What about the children\", shrieking it most often when residents of the fictional town of Springfield debated a contentious problem or argued about politics and logic failed. Lovejoy's comic use of the phrase on \"The Simpsons\" satirized its use in public discourse.\n\nAfter the popularization of the phrase on \"The Simpsons\", its use in society was often ridiculed. In the \"Toronto Star\", journalist Edward Keenan referred to it as \"Lovejoy's Law\". Keenan defined \"Lovejoy's Law\" as a warning that the phrase is a probable diversion from a weak logical stance, writing that true empathy toward children involved rational argument rather than manipulation. In an article for Ireland's \"Sunday Independent\", Carol Hunt called the use of the phrase in political debate the \"Helen Lovejoy defence\" and wrote that it is also known as the \"Helen Lovejoy syndrome\". According to Hunt, it is often invoked in reference to hypothetical children rather than real children affected by a problem.\n\nIn a \"Georgia State University Law Review\" article, Michigan State University College of Law professor Charles J. Ten Brink wrote that Helen Lovejoy's signature phrase was an adept and effective parody. According to \"The Canberra Times\", the phrase's 2009 use to support Internet censorship by the Department of Communications of the government of Australia was evocative of Helen Lovejoy.\n\nIn his book, \"The Myth of Evil\", Phillip A. Cole wrote that Helen Lovejoy's plea assumed that children were pure, unadulterated potential casualties who required constant defense from danger. Cole contrasted this notion with character Bart Simpson, who prefers creating disorder to conformity and adherence to regulations. According to Cole, this exemplifies the dual perception of children by society: guileless potential prey and malevolent entities to be distrusted. Cole wrote that throughout history, the child has represented humanity's savage past and its optimistic future. Jo Johnson contributed a chapter, \"Won't Somebody Think of the Children?\", to the book \"Mediating Moms\", in which she analyzed the phrase's use in animated media (including \"The Simpsons\"). According to Johnson, the phrase was a key example of popular cultural depictions of mothers as neurotic and filled with anxiety about moral values.\n\n\n\n"}

For example, alcohol consumption was proven to be significantly higher in reality than in the questionnaires completed by the people studied. Such findings have highlighted the difference between people's self-reported and actual behaviors.\n\nSuch findings cast doubt on the reliability of historical record when applied to archaeological sites in general and follow a processualist approach stressing the benefits of scientific analysis. \n\nThe project has since expanded to other American cities and has undertaken excavation of landfill sites. Among many of the important results of Rathje, were his conclusion on landfill degradation and consumer waste patterns. For example, an intuitive idea that existed before Rathje's work is that people will waste less expensive food in times of economic recession. Rathje's landfill project proved this idea to be incorrect: when resources are scarce, people tend to buy larger quantities of -for example- beef-meat, when they are on sale, only to end up throwing it out again as they have bought too much to consume before the expiration dates. Rathje's data shows that waste beef is far more common during an economic recession.\nAnother idea Rathje shattered is that of paper degradation in landfills. For a long time, it was believed that paper is a relatively safe and environmentally friendly waste product, degrading quickly in landfills. Rathje showed, however, that in fact paper is a typically \"bad degrader\": newspapers dumped in landfills as much as over half a century ago, turn up again as fresh and as readable as the day they were issued.\n\n"}
{"id": "14507404", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14507404", "title": "Wealth inequality in the United States", "text": "Wealth inequality in the United States\n\nWealth inequality in the United States (also known as the wealth gap) is the unequal distribution of assets among residents of the United States. Wealth includes the values of homes, automobiles, personal valuables, businesses, savings, and investments. The net worth of U.S. households and non-profit organizations was $94.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2017, a record level both in nominal terms and purchasing power parity. Divided equally among 124 million U.S. households, this would be $760,000 per family. However, the bottom 50% of families, representing 62 million households, average $11,000 net worth. From an international perspective, the difference in US median and mean wealth per adult is over 600%.\n\nJust prior to President Obama's 2014 State of the Union Address, media reported that the top wealthiest 1% possess 40% of the nation's wealth; the bottom 80% own 7%; similarly, but later, the media reported, the \"richest 1 percent in the United States now own more additional income than the bottom 90 percent\". The gap between the top 10% and the middle class is over 1,000%; that increases another 1,000% for the top 1%. The average employee \"needs to work more than a month to earn what the CEO earns in one hour.\" Although different from income inequality, the two are related. In \"Inequality for All\"—a 2013 documentary with Robert Reich in which he argued that income inequality is the defining issue for the United States—Reich states that 95% of economic gains went to the top 1% net worth (HNWI) since 2009 when the recovery allegedly started. More recently, in 2017, an Oxfam study found that eight rich people, six of them Americans, own as much combined wealth as half the human race.\n\nA 2011 study found that US citizens across the political spectrum dramatically underestimate the current US wealth inequality and would prefer a far more egalitarian distribution of wealth.\n\nWealth is usually not used for daily expenditures or factored into household budgets, but combined with income it comprises the family's total opportunity to secure a desired stature and standard of living, or pass their class status along to one's children. Moreover, wealth provides for both short- and long-term financial security, bestows social prestige, and contributes to political power, and can be used to produce more wealth. Hence, wealth possesses a psychological element that awards people the feeling of agency, or the ability to act. The accumulation of wealth grants more options and eliminates restrictions about how one can live life. Dennis Gilbert asserts that the standard of living of the working and middle classes is dependent upon income and wages, while the rich tend to rely on wealth, distinguishing them from the vast majority of Americans. A September 2014 study by Harvard Business School declared that the growing disparity between the very wealthy and the lower and middle classes is no longer sustainable.\n\nIn 2007, the top 20% wealthiest possessed 80% of all financial assets. In 2007 the richest 1% of the American population owned 35% of the country's total wealth, and the next 19% owned 51%. Thus, the top 20% of Americans owned 86% of the country's wealth and the bottom 80% of the population owned 14%. In 2011, financial inequality was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 43%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%. However, after the Great Recession which started in 2007, the share of total wealth owned by the top 1% of the population grew from 35% to 37%, and that owned by the top 20% of Americans grew from 86% to 88%. The Great Recession also caused a drop of 36% in median household wealth, but a drop of only 11% for the top 1%, further widening the gap between the top 1% and the bottom 99%.\n\nAccording to PolitiFact and others, in 2011 the 400 wealthiest Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. Inherited wealth may help explain why many Americans who have become rich may have had a substantial head start. In September 2012, according to the Institute for Policy Studies, over 60 percent of the Forbes richest 400 Americans grew up in substantial privilege.\n\nIn 2013 wealth inequality in the U.S. was greater than in most developed countries other than Switzerland and Denmark. In the United States, the use of offshore holdings is exceptionally small compared to Europe, where much of the wealth of the top percentiles is kept in offshore holdings. While the statistical problem is European wide, in Southern Europe statistics become even more unreliable. Fewer than a thousand people in Italy have declared incomes of more than 1 million euros. Former Prime Minister of Italy described tax evasion as a \"national pastime\". According to a 2014 Credit Suisse study, the ratio of wealth to household income is the highest it has been since the Great Depression.\n\nHowever, according to the federal reserve, \"For most households, pensions and Social Security are the most important sources of income during retirement, and the promised benefit stream constitutes a sizable fraction of household wealth\" and \"including pensions and Social Security in net worth makes the distribution more even\". A September 2017 study by the Federal Reserve reported that the top 1% owned 38.5% of the country's wealth in 2016.\n\nAccording to a June 2017 report by the Boston Consulting Group, around 70% of the nation's wealth will be in the hands of millionaires and billionaires by 2021.\n\nPioneering work by Simon Kuznets using income tax records and his own well-researched estimates of national income showed a reduction of about 10% in the portion of national income going to the top 10%, a reduction from about 45–50% in 1913 to about 30–35% in 1948. This period spans both The Great Depression and World War II, events with significant economic consequences. This is called the Great Compression.\n\nThere is an important distinction between income and wealth. Income refers to a flow of money over time in the form of a rate (per hour, per week, or per year); wealth is a collection of assets owned minus liabilities. In essence, income is specifically what people receive through work, retirement, or social welfare whereas wealth is what people own. While the two are seemingly related, income inequality alone is insufficient for understanding economic inequality for two reasons:\n\nThe United States Census Bureau formally defines income as received on a regular basis (exclusive of certain money receipts such as capital gains) before payments for personal income taxes, social security, union dues, medicare deductions, etc. By this official measure, the wealthiest families may have low income, but the value of their assets earns enough money to support their lifestyle. Dividends from trusts or gains in the stock market do not fall under the definition of income but are the primary money flows for the wealthy. Retired people also have little income but usually have a higher net worth because of money saved over time.\n\nAdditionally, income does not capture the extent of wealth inequality. Wealth is derived over time from the collection of income earnings and growth of assets. The income of one year cannot encompass the accumulation over a lifetime. Income statistics view too narrow a time span for it to be an adequate indicator of financial inequality. For example, the Gini coefficient for wealth inequality increased from 0.80 in 1983 to 0.84 in 1989. In the same year, 1989, the Gini coefficient for income was only 0.52. The Gini coefficient is an economic tool on a scale from 0 to 1 that measures the level of inequality. 1 signifies perfect inequality and 0 represents perfect equality. From this data, it is evident that in 1989 there was a discrepancy about the level of economic disparity with the extent of wealth inequality significantly higher than income inequality. Recent research shows that many households, in particular those headed by young parents (younger than 35), minorities, and individuals with low educational attainment, display very little accumulation. Many have no financial assets and their total net worth is also low.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, between 1979 and 2007 incomes of the top 1% of Americans grew by an average of 275%. ... (Note: The IRS insists that comparisons of adjusted gross income pre-1987 and post-1987 are complicated by large changes in the definition of AGI led to households in the top income quintile reporting a lot more of their income in their individual income tax form's AGI, rather than reporting their business income in separate corporate tax returns, or not reporting certain non-taxable income in their AGI at all, such as municipal bond income. Anyone who wants to discuss incomes in the U.S. fairly must include a chart of all available data split by quintile up to the mid-1980s. That should be followed by a chart from 1990 to 2011. The five-year gap would avoid the major AGI definition changes. The big picture of this subject is not just a segment of all available data starting in 1979, especially after the IRS warned about the large AGI definition changes in the late 1980s). In addition, IRS studies consistently show a majority of households in the top income quintile have moved to a lower quintile within one decade. There are even more changes to households in the top 1%. Without including those data here, a reader is likely to assume households in the Top 1% are almost the same from year to year.) In 2009, people in the top 1% of taxpayers made $343,927 or more. According to US economist Joseph Stiglitz the richest 1% of Americans gained 93% of the additional income created in 2010. A study by Emmanuel Saez and Piketty showed that the top 10 percent of earners took more than half of the country's total income in 2012, the highest level recorded since the government began collecting the relevant data a century ago. People in the top one percent were three times more likely to work more than 50 hours a week, were more likely to be self-employed, and earned a fifth of their income as capital income. The top one percent was composed of many professions and had an annual turnover rate of more than 25%. The five most common professions were managers, physicians, administrators, lawyers, and teachers.\n\nIn the book \"Modern Labor Economics: Theory and Public Policy\", it is noted that in the United States all income that employees received from their employers in 2012 was 8.6 trillion dollars while the amount of money received from all other sources of personal income in that year came to 5.3 trillion dollars. This makes the relationship of employee to employer and vocational employment in general of paramount importance in the United States.\n\nIn 2013 UNICEF data on the well-being of children in 35 developed nations ranked the United States at 34 out of 35 (Romania is the worst). This may reflect growing income inequality.\n\nIn March 2017, NPR summarized the distribution of U.S. stock market ownership (direct and indirect through mutual funds) in the U.S., which is highly concentrated among the wealthiest families:\n\nThe Federal Reserve reported the median value of stock ownership by income group for 2016:\n\nNPR reported that when politicians reference the stock market as a measure of economic success, that success is not relevant to nearly half of Americans. Further, more than one-third of Americans who work full-time have no access to pensions or retirement accounts such as 401(k)s that derive their value from financial assets like stocks and bonds. The NYT reported that the percentage of workers covered by generous defined-benefit pension plans has declined from 62% in 1983 to 17% by 2016. While some economists consider an increase in the stock market to have a \"wealth effect\" that increases economic growth, economists like Former Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher believe those effects are limited.\n\nEssentially, the wealthy possess greater financial opportunities that allow their money to make more money. Earnings from the stock market or mutual funds are reinvested to produce a larger return. Over time, the sum that is invested becomes progressively more substantial. Those who are not wealthy, however, do not have the resources to enhance their opportunities and improve their economic position. Rather, \"after debt payments, poor families are constrained to spend the remaining income on items that will not produce wealth and will depreciate over time.\" Scholar David B. Grusky notes that \"62 percent of households headed by single parents are without savings or other financial assets.\" Net indebtedness generally prevents the poor from having any opportunity to accumulate wealth and thereby better their conditions.\n\nEconomic inequality is a result of difference in income. Factors that contribute to this gap in wages are things such as level of education, labor market demand and supply, gender differences, growth in technology, and personal abilities. The quality and level of education that a person has often corresponds to their skill level, which is justified by their income. Wages are also determined by the \"market price of a skill\" at that current time. Although gender inequality is a separate social issue, it plays a role in economic inequality. According to the U.S. Census Report, in America the median full-time salary for women is 77 percent of that for men. Also contributing to the wealth inequality in the U.S., both unskilled and skilled workers are being replaced by machinery. The Seven Pillars Institute for Global Finance and Ethics argues that because of this \"technological advance\", the income gap between workers and owners has widened.\n\nIncome inequality contributes to wealth inequality. For example, economist Emmanuel Saez wrote in June 2016 that the top 1% of families captured 52% of the total real income (GDP) growth per family from 2009-2015. From 2009 to 2012, the top 1% captured 91% of the income gains.\n\nNotably, for both the wealthy and not-wealthy, the process of accumulation or debt is cyclical. The rich use their money to earn larger returns and the poor have no savings with which to produce returns or eliminate debt. Unlike income, both facets are generational. Wealthy families pass down their assets allowing future generations to develop even more wealth. The poor, on the other hand, are less able to leave inheritances to their children leaving the latter with little or no wealth on which to build...This is another reason why wealth inequality is so important, its accumulation has direct implications for economic inequality among the children of today's families.\n\nCorresponding to financial resources, the wealthy strategically organize their money so that it will produce profit. Affluent people are more likely to allocate their money to financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and other investments which hold the possibility of capital appreciation. Those who are not wealthy are more likely to have their money in savings accounts and home ownership. This difference comprises the largest reason for the continuation of wealth inequality in America: the rich are accumulating more assets while the middle and working classes are just getting by. Currently, the richest 1% hold about 38% of all privately held wealth in the United States. while the bottom 90% held 73.2% of all debt. According to \"The New York Times\", the richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.\n\nHowever, other studies argue that higher average savings rate will contribute to the reduction of the share of wealth owned by the rich. The reason is that the rich in wealth are not necessarily the individuals with the highest income. Therefore, the relative wealth share of poorer quintiles of the population would increase if the savings rate of income is very large, although the absolute difference from the wealthiest will increase.\n\nAs the price of commodities increases because of inflation, a larger percentage of lower-class people's money is spent on things they need to survive and go to work, such as food and gasoline. Most of the working poor are paid fixed hourly wages that do not keep up with rises in prices, so every year an increasing percentage of their income is consumed until they have to go into debt just to survive. At this point, their little wealth is owed to lenders and banking institutions.\n\nThe nature of tax policies in America has been suggested by economists and politicians such as Emmanuel Saez, Thomas Piketty, and Barack Obama to perpetuate economic inequality in America by steering large sums of wealth into the hands of the wealthiest Americans. The mechanism for this is that when the wealthy avoid paying taxes, wealth concentrates to their coffers and the poor go into debt.\n\nThe economist Joseph Stiglitz argues that \"Strong unions have helped to reduce inequality, whereas weaker unions have made it easier for CEOs, sometimes working with market forces that they have helped shape, to increase it.\" The long fall in unionization in the U.S. since WWII has seen a corresponding rise in the inequality of wealth and income.\n\nThe wealth gap between white and black families nearly tripled from $85,000 in 1984 to $236,500 in 2009.\n\nThere are many causes, including years of home ownership, household income, unemployment, and education, but inheritance might be the most important. Inheritance can directly link the disadvantaged economic position and prospects of today's blacks to the disadvantaged positions of their parents' and grandparents' generations. According to a report done by Robert B. Avery and Michael S. Rendall, \"one in three white households will receive a substantial inheritance during their lifetime compared to only one in ten black households.\" This relative lack of inheritance that has been observed among African Americans can be attributed in large part to factors such as unpaid labor (slavery), violent destruction of personal property in incidents such as Red Summer of 1919, unequal opportunity in education and employment (racial discrimination), and more recent policies such as redlining and planned shrinkage. Other ethnic minorities, particularly those with darker complexions, have at times faced many of these same adversities to various degrees.\n\nThe article \"America's Financial Divide\" added context to racial wealth inequality stating \"…nearly 96.1 percent of the 1.2 million households in the top one percent by income were white, a total of about 1,150,000 households. In addition, these families were found to have a median net asset worth of $8.3 million. In stark contrast, in the same piece, black households were shown as a mere 1.4 percent of the top one percent by income, that's only 16,800 homes. In addition, their median net asset worth was just $1.2 million. Using this data as an indicator only several thousand of the over 14 million African American households have more than $1.2 million in net assets… Relying on data from Credit Suisse and Brandeis University's Institute on Assets and Social Policy, the \"Harvard Business Review\" in the article \"How America's Wealthiest Black Families Invest Money\" recently took the analysis above a step further. In the piece the author stated \"If you're white and have a net worth of about $356,000, that's good enough to put you in the 72nd percentile of white families. If you're black, it's good enough to catapult you into the 95th percentile.\" This means 28 percent of the total 83 million white homes, or over 23 million white households, have more than $356,000 in net assets. While only 700,000 of the 14 million black homes have more than $356,000 in total net worth.\" According to Inequality.org, the median black family is actually only worth $1,700 when you deduct these durables. In contrast, the median white family holds $116,800 of wealth using the same accounting methods. Some historical context: In South Africa, during the atrocities of apartheid, the median black family held about 7 percent of typical white South African family net worth. Today, using Wolff’s analysis, the median African American family holds a mere 1.5 percent of median white American family wealth.\n\nA recent piece on Eurweb/Electronic Urban Report \"Black Wealth Hardly Exists, Even When You Include NBA, NFL and Rap Stars\" stated this about the difference between black middle class families and white middle class families. \"Going even further into the data, a recent study by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and the Corporation For Economic Development (CFED) found that it would take 228 years for the average black family to amass the same level of wealth the average white family holds today in 2016. All while white families create even more wealth over those same two hundred years. In fact, this is a gap that will never close if America stays on its current economic path. According to the Institute on Assets and Social Policy, for each dollar of increase in average income an African American household saw from 1984 to 2009 just $0.69 in additional wealth was generated, compared with the same dollar in increased income creating an additional $5.19 in wealth for a similarly situated white household.\"\n\nAuthor Lilian Singh wrote on why the perceptions about black life created by media are misleading in the \"American Prospect\" piece \"Black Wealth On TV: Realities Don’t Match Perceptions\". \"Black programming features TV shows that collectively create false perceptions of wealth for African-American families. The images displayed are in stark contrast to the economic conditions the average black family is battling each day.\"\n\nIn an article on \"Huffington Post\" by Antonio Moore \"The Decadent Veil: Black America's Wealth Illusion\" the question of inequity is taken another critical step forward and the piece digs into how celebrity is masking this massive inequality. Excerpt: \"The decadent veil looks at black Americans through a lens of group theory and seeks to explain an illusion that has taken form over a 30-year span of financial deregulation and new found access to unsecured credit. This veil is trimmed with million-dollar sports contracts, Roc Nation tour deals and designer labels made for heads of state. As black celebrity invited us into their homes through shows like MTV cribs, we forgot the condition of overall African American financial affairs. Despite a large section of the 14 million black households drowning in poverty and debt the stories of a few are told as if they represent those of millions, not thousands. It is this new veil of economics that has allowed for a broad swath of America to become not just desensitized to black poverty, but also hypnotized by black celebrity… The decadent veil not only warps the black community's vision outward to a larger economic world, but it also distorts outside community's view of Black America's actual financial reality.\"\n\nAccording to an article by the Pew research Center, the median wealth of non-Hispanic black households fell nearly 38% from 2010 to 2013. During that time, the median wealth of those households fell from $16,600 to $13,700. The median wealth of Hispanic families fell 14.3 % as well, from $16,000 to $14,000. Despite the median net worth of all households in the United States decreasing with time, as of 2013, white households had a median net worth of $141,900 while black house households had a median net worth of just $11,000. Hispanic households had a median net worth of just $13,700 over that time as well.\n\nA 2014 study by researchers at Princeton and Northwestern concludes that government policies reflect the desires of the wealthy, and that the vast majority of American citizens have \"minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy … when a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose.\" When Fed chair Janet Yellen was questioned by Bernie Sanders about the study at a congressional hearing in May 2014, she responded \"There’s no question that we’ve had a trend toward growing inequality\" and that this trend \"can shape [and] determine the ability of different groups to participate equally in a democracy and have grave effects on social stability over time.\"\n\nIn \"Capital in the Twenty-First Century,\" French economist Thomas Piketty argues that \"extremely high levels\" of wealth inequality are \"incompatible with the meritocratic values and principles of social justice fundamental to modern democratic societies\" and that \"the risk of a drift towards oligarchy is real and gives little reason for optimism about where the United States is headed.\"\n\nAccording to Jedediah Purdy, a researcher at the Duke School of Law, the inequality of wealth in the United States has constantly opened the eyes of the many problems and shortcomings of its financial system over at least the last fifty years of the debate. For years, people believed that distributive justice would produce a sustainable level of wealth inequality. It was also thought that a certain state would be able to effectively diminish the amount of inequality that would occur. Something that was for the most part not expected is the fact that the inequality levels created by the growing markets would lessen the power of that state and prevent the majority of the political community from actually being able to deliver on its plans of distributive justice, however it has just lately come to attention of the mass majority.\n\n\nPurdy, Jedediah S., Wealth, Inequality, and Democracy (May 13, 2015).

The library was the first Polish public library, the largest library in Poland, and one of the earliest public libraries in Europe.\n\nAfter the Kościuszko Uprising (1794), Russian troops, acting on orders from Czarina Catherine II, seized the library's holdings and transported them to her personal collection at Saint Petersburg, where a year later it formed the cornerstone of the newly founded Imperial Public Library.\n\nIn the 1920s the government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic returned some of the former Załuski Library holdings to the recently established Second Polish Republic thanks to the Treaty of Riga. These holdings were deliberately destroyed by German troops during the planned destruction of Warsaw in October 1944, following the collapse of the Warsaw Uprising.\n\nThe Załuski brothers' greatest passion was books. Józef Andrzej Załuski and his brother Andrzej Stanisław Załuski acquired the collections of earlier Polish bibliophiles such as Jakub Zadzik, Krzysztof Opaliński, Tomasz Ujejski, Janusz Wiśniowiecki, Jerzy Mniszech and Jan III Sobieski (the latter, from his granddaughter, Maria Karolina Sobieska).\n\nFrom the 1730s the brothers planned the creation of a library, and in 1747 they founded the Załuski Library (\"Biblioteka Załuskich\"). Located in the 17th-century Daniłowicz Palace in Warsaw (built for Mikołaj Daniłowicz of Żurów), the library building had two stories (the large reading room was on the second floor) and was topped with a small tower containing an astronomical observatory. The building's reconstruction in rococo style was accomplished in 1745 by Francesco Antonio Melana and his brother.\n\nThe Załuski Library was considered the first Polish public library and one of the largest libraries in the contemporary world. In all of Europe there were only two or three libraries that could boast such holdings. The library initially held some 200,000 items, which grew to some 400,000 printed items, maps and manuscripts by the end of the 1780s. It also accumulated a collection of art, scientific instruments, and plant and animal specimens.\n\nThis library, open on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., asked patrons to be quiet and to say a prayer in the intention of the Załuski brothers. It was prohibited to take the books outside the library, as the book theft was a growing problem, to an extent that the bishop patrons decided to ask the pope for help. Responding to their request, in 1752 pope Benedict XIV issued a papal bull that threatened to excommunication individuals taking the books from this library; even that did not eliminate the problem completely.\nAfter the brothers' deaths, the newly formed Commission for National Education took charge of the library, renaming it the Załuski Brothers' Library of the Republic.\n\nTwenty years later in 1794, in the aftermath of the second Partition of Poland and Kościuszko Uprising, Russian troops, on orders from Russian Czarina Catherine II, emptied the library and dispatched the whole collection to Saint Petersburg, where the books formed the mass of the Imperial Public Library on its formation, a year later. Parts of the collections were damaged or destroyed as they were mishandled while being removed from the library and transported to Russia, and many were stolen. According to the historian Joachim Lelewel, the Zaluskis' books, \"could be bought at Grodno by the basket\".\n\nThe collection was later dispersed among several Russian libraries. Some parts of the Zaluski collection came back to Poland on two separate dates in the nineteenth century: 1842 and 1863. In the 1920s, in the aftermath of the Polish-Soviet War and the Treaty of Riga the RSFSR's government returned around 50,000 items from the collection to Poland, yet German soldiers deliberately destroyed these items during the Planned destruction of Warsaw in October 1944, after collapse of the Warsaw Uprising. Only 1800 manuscripts and 30,000 printed materials from the original library survived the war.\n\nIn 1821 the library's original home was altered into a tenement house. During the building's reconstruction, the busts of Polish monarchs that had originally adorned the library's interiors, and which had been hidden during the Partitions of Poland, were discovered and placed on the building's facade; hence the building came to be called the \"House of the Kings\" (\"Dom pod Królami\").\n\nThe building was destroyed by the Germans during World War II. After the war, it was rebuilt under the Polish People's Republic.\n\nToday's Polish National Library (\"Biblioteka Narodowa\"), founded in 1928, considers itself the descendant of the Załuski Library.\n\n\n\n"}
