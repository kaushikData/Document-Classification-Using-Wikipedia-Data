{"id": "324918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324918", "title": "Anomic aphasia", "text": "Anomic aphasia\n\nAnomic aphasia (also known as dysnomia, nominal aphasia, and amnesic aphasia) is a mild, fluent type of aphasia where an individual has word retrieval failures and cannot express the words they want to say (particularly nouns and verbs). Anomia is a deficit of expressive language. The most pervasive deficit in the aphasias is anomia. Some level of anomia is seen in all of the aphasias. Individuals with aphasia who display anomia can often describe an object in detail and maybe even use hand gestures to demonstrate how the object is used but cannot find the appropriate word to name the object.\n\nThere are three main types of anomia:\n\n\nAnomia can be genetic or caused by damage to various parts of the parietal lobe or the temporal lobe of the brain by an accident or stroke, or a brain tumor.\n\nAlthough the main causes are not specifically known, many researchers have found factors contributing to anomic aphasia. It is known that people with damage to the left hemisphere of the brain are more likely to have anomic aphasia. Broca's area, the speech production center in the brain, was linked to being the source for speech execution problems, with the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), now commonly used to study anomic patients. Other experts believe that damage to Wernicke's area, which is the speech comprehension area of the brain, is connected to anomia because the patients cannot comprehend the words that they are hearing.\n\nAlthough many experts have believed that damage to Broca's area or Wernicke's area are the main causes of anomia, current studies have shown that damage in the left parietal lobe is the epicenter of anomic aphasia. One study was conducted using a word repetition test as well as fMRI in order to see the highest level of activity as well as where the lesions are in the brain tissue. Fridrikkson, et al. saw that damage to neither Broca's area nor Wernicke's area were the sole sources of anomia in the subjects. Therefore, the original anomia model, which theorized that damage occurred on the surface of the brain in the grey matter was debunked, and it was found that the damage was in the white matter deeper in the brain, on the left hemisphere. More specifically, the damage was in a part of the nerve tract called the arcuate fasciculus, for which the mechanism of action is unknown, though it is known to connect the posterior (back) of the brain to the anterior (front) and vice versa.\n\nNew data has shown that although the arcuate fascicles' main function does not include connecting Wernicke's area and Broca's area, damage to the tract does create speech problems because the speech comprehension and speech production areas are connected by this tract. Some studies have found that in right-handed people the language center is 99% in the left hemisphere; therefore, anomic aphasia almost exclusively occurs with damage to the left hemisphere. However, in left-handed people the language center is about 60% in the left hemisphere; thus, anomic aphasia can occur with damage to the right hemisphere in left-handed people. \n\nThe best way to see if anomic aphasia has developed is by using verbal as well as imaging tests. The combination of the two tests seem to be most effective, since either test done alone may give false positives or false negatives. For example, the verbal test is used to see if there is a speech disorder, and whether it is a problem in speech production or in comprehension. Patients with Alzheimer's disease have speech problems that are linked to dementia or progressive aphasias which can include anomia. The imaging test, mostly done using MRI scans, is ideal for lesion mapping or viewing deterioration in the brain. However, imaging cannot diagnose anomia on its own because the lesions may not be located deep enough to damage the white matter or damage the arcuate fasciculus. However, anomic aphasia is very difficult to associate with a specific lesion location in the brain. Therefore, the combination of speech tests and imaging tests has the highest sensitivity and specificity.\n\nIt is important to first do a hearing test, in case the patient cannot clearly hear the words or sentences needed in the speech repetition test. In the speech tests, the person is asked to repeat a sentence with common words; if the person cannot identify the word but he or she can describe it, then the person is highly likely to have anomic aphasia. However, to be completely sure, the test is given while a test subject is in an fMRI scanner, and the exact location of the lesions and areas activated by speech are pinpointed. Few simpler or cheaper options are available, so lesion mapping and speech repetition tests are the main ways of diagnosing anomic aphasia.\nAnomic aphasia (anomia) is a type of aphasia characterized by problems recalling words, names, and numbers. Speech is fluent and receptive language is not impaired in someone with anomic aphasia. Subjects often use circumlocutions (speaking in a roundabout way) in order to avoid a name they cannot recall or to express a certain word they cannot remember. Sometimes the subject can recall the name when given clues. Additionally, patients are able to speak with correct grammar; the main problem is finding the appropriate word to identify an object or person.\n\nSometimes subjects may know what to do with an object, but still not be able to give a name to the object. For example, if a subject is shown an orange and asked what it is called, the subject may be well aware that the object can be peeled and eaten, and may even be able to demonstrate this by actions or even verbal responses – however, they cannot recall that the object is called an \"orange\". Sometimes, when a person with this condition is multilingual, they might confuse the language they are speaking in trying to find the right word (inadvertent code-switching).\n\nThere is no method available to completely cure anomic aphasia. However, there are treatments to help improve word-finding skills.\n\nAlthough a person with anomia may find it difficult to recall many types of words such as common nouns, proper nouns, verbs, etc., many studies have shown that treatment for object words, or nouns, has shown promise in rehabilitation research. The treatment includes visual aids, such as pictures, and the patient is asked to identify the object or activity. However, if that is not possible, then the patient is shown the same picture surrounded by words associated with the object or activity. Throughout the process, positive encouragement is provided. The treatment shows an increase in word-finding during treatment; however, word identifying decreased two weeks after the rehabilitation period. Therefore, it shows that rehabilitation effort needs to be continuous for word-finding abilities to improve from the baseline. The studies show that verbs are harder to recall or repeat, even with rehabilitation.\n\nOther methods in treating anomic aphasia include Circumlocution Induced Naming therapy (CIN), wherein the patient uses circumlocution to assist with his or her naming rather than just being told to name the item pictured after given some sort of cue. Results suggest that the patient does better in properly naming objects when undergoing this therapy because CIN strengthens the weakened link between semantics and phonology for patients with anomia, since they often know what an object is used for but cannot verbally name it.\n\nAnomia is often challenging for the families and friends of those suffering from it. One way to overcome this is computer-based treatment models, effective especially when used with clinical therapy. Leemann et al. provided anomic patients with computerized-assisted therapy (CAT) sessions, along with traditional therapy sessions using treatment lists of words. Some of the patients received a drug known to help relieve symptoms of anomia (levodopa) while others received a placebo. The researchers found that the drug had no significant effects on improvement with the treatment lists, but almost all of the patients improved after the CAT sessions. They concluded that this form of computerized treatment is effective in increasing naming abilities in anomic patients.\n\nAdditionally, one study researched the effects of using \"excitatory (anodal) transcranial direct current stimulation\" over the right temporo-parietal cortex, a brain area that seems to correlate to language. The electrical stimulation seemed to enhance language training outcome in patients with chronic aphasia.\n\nMany different populations can and do suffer from anomia. For instance, deaf patients who have suffered a stroke can demonstrate semantic and phonological errors, much like hearing anomic patients. Researchers have called this subtype sign anomia.\n\nBilingual patients typically experience anomia to a greater degree in just one of their fluent languages. However, there has been conflicting evidence as to which language – first or second – suffers more.\n\nResearch on children with anomia has indicated that children who undergo treatment are, for the most part, able to gain back normal language abilities, aided by brain plasticity. However, longitudinal research on children with anomic aphasia due to head injury shows that even several years after the injury, some signs of deficient word retrieval are still observed. These remaining symptoms can sometimes cause academic difficulties later on.\n\nThis disorder may be extremely frustrating for people with and without the disorder. Although the person with anomic aphasia may know the specific word, they may not be able to recall it and this can be very difficult for everyone in the conversation. Positive reinforcements are helpful.\n\nAlthough there are not many literary cases about anomic aphasia, there are many non-fiction books about living with aphasia. One of them is \"The Man Who Lost His Language\" by Sheila Hale. It is the story of Sheila Hale's husband, John Hale, a scholar who suffered a stroke and lost speech formation abilities. In her book, Sheila Hale also explains the symptoms and mechanics behind aphasia and speech formation. She adds the emotional components of dealing with a person with aphasia and how to be patient with the speech and communication.\n\n"}

Parallelism of expression serves to emphasize opposition of ideas\".\n\nAn antithesis must always contain two ideas within one statement. The ideas may not be structurally opposite, but they serve to be functionally opposite when comparing two ideas for emphasis.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, the use of an antithesis makes the audience better understand the point the speaker is trying to make. Further explained, the comparison of two situations or ideas makes choosing the correct one simpler. Aristotle states that antithesis in rhetoric is similar to syllogism due to the presentation of two conclusions within a statement.\n\nAntitheses are used to strengthen an argument by using either exact opposites or simply contrasting ideas, but can also include both. They typically make a sentence more memorable for the reader or listener through balance and emphasis of the words.\n\nIn rhetoric, antithesis is a figure of speech involving the bringing out of a contrast in the ideas by an obvious contrast in the words, clauses, or sentences, within a parallel grammatical structure. \n\nThe term \"antithesis\" in rhetoric goes back to the 4th century BC, for example Aristotle, \"Rhetoric\", 1410a, in which he gives a series of examples.\n\nAn antithesis can be a simple statement contrasting two things, using a parallel structure:\n\n\nOften there is a double antithesis, as in the following proverb, where \"man\" is opposed to \"God\", and \"proposes\" is contrasted with \"disposes\":\n\n\nAnother type is of the form \"not A, but B\" (negative-positive), in which the point made is emphasised by first being contrasted with its negative:\n\n\nAnother type involves a chiasmus (AB, BA word order), in which the contrasted words switch places:\n\n\nThe negative-positive antithesis and the chiasmus-antithesis can be combined, as in the following sentence:\n\nSome other examples of antithesis are:\n\n\n\"Matthew's Antitheses\" is the traditional name given to a section of the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus takes six well known prescriptions of the Mosaic Law and calls his followers to do more than the Law requires. Protestant scholars since the Reformation have generally believed that Jesus was setting his teaching over against false interpretations of the Law current at the time. \"Antithesis\" was the name given by Marcion of Sinope to a manifesto in which he contrasted the Old Testament with the New Testament and defined what came to be known as Marcionism.\n\nIn dialectics (any formal system of reasoning that arrives at the truth by the exchange of logical arguments) antithesis is the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas, usually in a balanced way. The logical arguments are said to be stated in the order thesis, antithesis, synthesis.\n\nAlthough this style of philosophical discussion (stating a point of view, then its opposite, and finally drawing a conclusion) was commonly used by ancient philosophers, the use of the trio \"thesis, antithesis, synthesis\" itself to describe it goes back only to the 18th century, to a work published in 1794 by the German philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte.\n\nThe phrase is sometimes incorrectly stated to originate from the German philosopher Hegel. However, Hegel never actually used the trio of terms except once in a lecture, in which he reproached Immanuel Kant for having \"everywhere posited thesis, antithesis, synthesis\".\n\n"}

One of the elements is called the appositive, although its identification requires consideration of how the elements are used in a sentence.\n\nFor example, in the two sentences below, the phrases \"Alice Smith\" and \"my sister\" are in apposition, with the appositive identified with italics:\n\nTraditionally, appositions were called by their Latin name \"appositio\", although the English form is now more commonly used. It is derived from Latin: \"ad\" (\"near\") and \"positio\" (\"placement\").\n\nApposition is a figure of speech of the scheme type, and often results when the verbs (particularly verbs of being) in supporting clauses are eliminated to produce shorter descriptive phrases. This makes them often function as hyperbatons, or figures of disorder, because they can disrupt the flow of a sentence. For example, in the phrase: \"My wife, a nurse by training, ...\", it is necessary to pause before the parenthetical modification \"a nurse by training\".\n\nA restrictive appositive provides information essential to identifying the phrase in apposition.\nIt limits or clarifies that phrase in some crucial way, and the meaning of the sentence would change if the appositive were removed.\nIn English, restrictive appositives are not set off by commas.\nThe sentences below use restrictive appositives. Here and elsewhere in this section, the relevant phrases are marked as the \"appositive phrase\" or the \"phrase in apposition\".\n\nA non-restrictive appositive provides information not critical to identifying the phrase in apposition.\nIt provides non-essential information, and the essential meaning of the sentence would not change if the appositive were removed.\nIn English, non-restrictive appositives are typically set off by commas.\nThe sentences below use non-restrictive appositives.\n\nThe same phrase can be a restrictive appositive in one context and a non-restrictive appositive in another:\nIf there is any doubt that the appositive is non-restrictive, it is safer to use the restrictive form.\nIn the example above, the restrictive first sentence is still correct even if there is only one brother.\n\nA relative clause is not always an appositive.\n\nIn the following examples, the appositive phrases are shown in italics:\n\n\nA kind of appositive is the false title, a restrictive phrase, as in \"\"Noted biologist\" Jane Smith has arrived.\", where the phrase \"Noted biologist\" is used as an informal title. The use of false titles is controversial.\n\nAppositive phrases can also serve as definitions:\n\n\nIn several languages, the same syntax that is used to express such relations as possession can also be used appositively.

In Bibles that follow the Greek Septuagint (LXX) rendering, depending upon the source manuscript used, \"Azal\" is transcribed \"Jasol\" (ιασολ, pronounced \"Yasol\"), \"Jasod\" (a corruption of \"Jasol\"), or \"Asael\" (ασαηλ):\n\nNo written work prior to the late 19th-century definitively identifies what, or where, Azal is or was. Most Bible commentators of the late 19th century considered it to be a place near Jerusalem. Cyril of Alexandria wrote in his commentary on the Book of Zechariah, Chapter 14. that Azal was known to be “a town situated at the far point of the mountain\".\n\nIn 1850, Palestinian geographer claimed that Azal was modern Azaria, situated a half mile southeast of the southernmost peak of the Mount of Olives (then called Mount Corruption).\n\nFrench Orientalist and archaeologist Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, who identified the site of the ancient Canaanite city of Gezer preserving the Mesha Stele's inscriptions claimed that Schwarz was referring to al-Eizariya, the traditional Bethany of New Testament times. However, al-Eizariya lies several kilometers due east of the Mount of Olives, not a half mile southeast of it, as Schwarz claimed.\n\nBetween 1873 and 1874, Clermont-Ganneau explored many tombs in a valley immediately south of Jerusalem, which the peasants of Silwan called . Based on geographic and linguistic evidence, Clermont-Ganneau proposed that Wady Yasul is Azal. Currently, this valley is bordered on the west by the Jerusalem Peace Forest and the neighborhood of Talpiot, on the north by the Abu Tor neighborhood on the southern slope of the Hill of Evil Council, and on the south by the neighborhood of Jabel Mukaber on the ridge where the former UN headquarters sits. The mouth of the valley lies at the base of the southernmost summit of the Mount of Olives (Mount of Corruption). Its Hebrew name is ().\n\nThere is evidence that Clermont-Ganneau's theory and the \"LXX\" rendering of Zechariah 14:5 are correct. In 1984, Israeli geologists Daniel Wachs and Dov Levitte identified the location of a large landslide on the Mount of Olives that is directly adjacent to both Wady Yasul (Nahal Atzal) and the area of the ancient King's Gardens at the juncture of the Hinnom and Kidron Valleys. Wachs' and Levitte's discovery validates Jewish historian Flavius Josephus' account of an earthquake-caused landslide during King Uzziah's reign blocking up the kings' gardens in the valley. It also accords with the \"LXX\" rendering of Zechariah 14:5, which states a valley will be blocked up as far as Azal. Additionally, the Israelis officially named this valley אצל (Atzal), which is the same Hebrew spelling of Azal (אצל).\n"}

This private member's public bill did not proceed beyond its introduction to second or third readings, nor did it receive royal assent, and therefore died at the close of the 37th Legislature. The bill proposed a fine of not more than $5,000, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both. The bill was hastily advanced in response to a dwarf-tossing contest that was held at Leopard's Lounge in Windsor, Ontario with a dwarf nicknamed \"Tripod\".\n\nThe mayor of the small French town of Morsang-sur-Orge prohibited dwarf-tossing. The case went through the appeal chain of administrative courts to the \"Conseil d'État\", which found that an administrative authority could legally prohibit dwarf-tossing on grounds that the activity did not respect human dignity and was thus contrary to public order. The question raised legal questions as to what was admissible as a motive for an administrative authority to ban an activity for motives of public order, especially as the \"conseil\" did not want to include \"public morality\" in public order. The ruling was taken by the full assembly and not a smaller panel—proof of the difficulty of the question. The \"conseil\" ruled similarly in another case between an entertainment company and the city of Aix-en-Provence.\n\nThe United Nations Human Rights Committee decided on July 26, 2002, that the ban was not discriminatory with respect to dwarfs. It ruled that the ban could be considered as \"necessary to protect public order, which brings into play considerations of human dignity\".\n\nNevertheless, dwarf-tossing is not prohibited outright in France. The \"Conseil d'État\" decided that a public authority could use gross infringement on human dignity as a motive of public order to cancel a spectacle, and that dwarf-tossing constituted such a gross infringement. However, it is up to individual authorities to make specific decisions regarding prohibition.\n\nRobert and Angela Van Etten, Florida members of the Little People of America, convinced the state's legislators in 1989 that dwarf-tossing be made illegal. A measure banning dwarf-tossing was passed by a wide margin. New York later followed suit.\n\nIn 2001, Dave Flood, who appeared on the MJ Morning Show as \"Dave the Dwarf,\" filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 1989 law allowing the state to fine or revoke the liquor license of a bar that allows dwarf-tossing. The pastime was popular in some Florida bars in the late 1980s.\n\nIn October 2011, Ritch Workman introduced legislation that would overturn the ban on dwarf-tossing, claiming such a ban to be an \"unnecessary burden on the freedom and liberties of people\" and \"an example of Big Brother government\". Although not a personal advocate of the activity, Workman stated \"if a little person wants to make a fool out of themselves for money, they should have the same right to do so as any average sized person\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "588873", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=588873", "title": "Espadrille", "text": "Espadrille\n\nEspadrilles or espardenyes are casual, flat, but sometimes high-heeled shoes. They usually have a canvas or cotton fabric upper and a flexible sole made of esparto rope. The esparto rope sole is the defining characteristic of an espadrille; the uppers vary widely in style. \n\nThe existence of this kind of shoe in Europe is documented since at least 1322, when it was described for the first time with its current Catalan name. \nThe term \"espadrille\" is French and derives from the word in the Occitan language, which comes from \"espardenya\" in Catalan or \"alpargata\" and \"esparteña\" in Spanish. Both \"espardenya\" and \"esparteña\" refer to a type of shoes made with esparto, a tough, wiry Mediterranean grass used in making rope. Its name in the Basque region is \"espartina\".\n\nEspadrilles have been made in Occitania region (France) and all over Spain, where they were the usual peasant footwear since the 14th century at least, and are still being produced as from old. The oldest, most primitive form of espadrilles dates as far back as 4000 years ago . Traditional espadrilles have a canvas upper with the toe and vamp cut in one piece and seamed to the rope sole at the sides. Often they have laces at the throat that are wrapped around the ankle to hold the shoes securely in place. Traditional espadrilles are worn by both men and women.\n\nOnce peasant footwear, then urban workers footwear, espadrilles nowadays have grown in popularity, especially in the French Atlantic coast of the Basque Country and Spanish Mediterranean coast from Granada to Girona, where many men and women wear them during the spring and summer months. Designer espadrilles are now widely available. They are usually manufactured in France, Spain and South Asia. Modern espadrilles are predominantly for women, though some men's shoes are made in this style.\n\nThe soles of espadrilles may be flat, platform, or wedge shaped made of natural fiber. Uppers may be made from nearly any substance and may have open or closed toes, open or closed backs, and can be slip-on or tied to the ankle with laces. Thousands of varieties of espadrilles can be found, from inexpensive bargain brands to high priced designer brands.\n\nEspadrilles became fashionable in the USA in the 1940s. Lauren Bacall's character in the 1948 movie \"Key Largo\" wore ankle-laced espadrilles.\n\nWedge shaped espadrilles were first popularized by French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent. At a trade fair in Paris in 1970, he came into contact with the Spanish espadrille manufacturer Castañer. Yves Saint Laurent had been looking in vain for months for someone to make him a wedge espadrille. Castañer managed to interpret Yves Saint Laurent's vision and the wedge espadrilles were an instant hit, influencing fashion even today.\n\nThe espadrille style was revived in the USA in the 1980s, due to the success of \"Miami Vice\"—the shoe was worn by the character Sonny Crockett (played by Don Johnson). In 2013 at luxury shoe stores in New York City, a pair of espadrilles could cost nearly $500. \n\nDue to cost and material availability, the soles of espadrilles are now commonly made with jute rope or braid. The natural bright white color of jute is a major design feature of modern espadrilles.\n\nBangladesh is the producer of high quality jute and has become a manufacturing center for premium quality jute soles and complete espadrilles. Ninety percent of the world's total production of complete espadrilles, as well as jute soles, is now manufactured in Bangladesh, although some manufacturers in Spain, France, and Italy import jute soles from Bangladesh to finish espadrilles in those countries. Complete espadrilles are also assembled in Argentina (known as alpargatas), Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay and Venezuela with imported jute from Bangladesh.\n\nJute soles typically include fully or partially vulcanized rubber beneath the jute soles for long-lasting espadrille shoes. Sometimes crepe soles are used as out-soles although those are not as durable compared to vulcanized ones. Jute braid soles might include heels made of wood or EVA foam.\n\nThe manufacture of espadrilles is generally more complex than that of sandals. The jute soles are the most critical part. The jute twines are first machine-braided. These braids are then manually formed into the shape of the sole and hydraulically pressed with heat to form the final shape and completed with vertical stitching with Espadrille Needles. These basic soles are then vulcanized underneath. EVA foam or wooden heels are glued in place and more jute braids are wrapped around it to complete the soles. Uppers of different styles are then built on the jute soles to complete the espadrille.\n\n"}

{"id": "31867283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31867283", "title": "Goldwater rule", "text": "Goldwater rule\n\nThe Goldwater rule is the informal name given to Section 7 in the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Principles of Medical Ethics, which states that it is unethical for psychiatrists to give a professional opinion about public figures whom they have not examined in person, and from whom they have not obtained consent to discuss their mental health in public statements. It is named after former U.S. Senator and 1964 presidential candidate Barry Goldwater.\n\nThe issue arose in 1964 when \"Fact\" published the article \"The Unconscious of a Conservative: A Special Issue on the Mind of Barry Goldwater\". The magazine polled psychiatrists about U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater and whether he was fit to be president. The editor, Ralph Ginzburg, was sued for libel in \"Goldwater v. Ginzburg\" where Goldwater won $75,000 (approximately $ today) in damages.\n\nSection 7, which appeared in the first edition of the APA's Principles of Medical Ethics in 1973 and is still in effect , says:\n\nThe APA Ethics Code of the American Psychological Association, a different organization than the American Psychiatric Association, also supports a similar rule. In 2016, in response to the \"New York Times\" article \"Should Therapists Analyze Presidential Candidates?\", American Psychological Association President Susan H. McDaniel published a letter in \"The\" \"New York Times\" in which she stated:\n\nIn the fall of 2017, the American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs wrote new guidelines into the AMA Code of Medical Ethics, stating that physicians should refrain \"from making clinical diagnoses about individuals (e.g., public officials, celebrities, persons in the news) they have not had the opportunity to personally examine.\"\n\nIn 2016 and 2017, a number of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists faced criticism for violating the Goldwater rule, as they claimed that Donald Trump displayed \"an assortment of personality problems, including grandiosity, a lack of empathy, and 'malignant narcissism, and that he has a \"dangerous mental illness\", despite having never examined him.\n\nJohn Gartner, a practicing psychologist, and the leader of the group Duty to Warn, stated in April 2017 that: \"We have an ethical responsibility to warn the public about Donald Trump's dangerous mental illness.\"\n\nThe American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA), a different organization from the APA, sent a letter on June 6, 2017, that highlighted differences between the APA and APsaA ethical guidelines, stating that \"The American Psychiatric Association's ethical stance on the Goldwater Rule applies to its members only. APsaA does not consider political commentary by its individual members an ethical matter.\" In July 2017, the website \"Stat\" published an article by Sharon Begley, labeled \"exclusive\" and titled \"Psychiatry group tells members they can defy 'Goldwater rule' and comment on Trump's mental health\". The article, with a photograph of Barry Goldwater as the headline image, stated that \"A leading psychiatry group has told its members they should not feel bound by a longstanding rule against commenting publicly on the mental state of public figures\", first sourcing the statement to the July 6 American Psychoanalytic Association (APsaA) letter, but also claiming that it \"represents the first significant crack in the profession's decades-old united front aimed at preventing experts from discussing the psychiatric aspects of politicians' behavior\"; the article then repeatedly referred to the \"Goldwater rule\", quoted an unnamed source as saying \"leadership has been extremely reluctant to make a statement and publicly challenge the American Psychiatric Association\", and claimed that an unnamed \"official\" had said that \"Although the American Psychological Association \"prefers\" that its members not offer opinions on the psychology of someone they have not examined, it does not have a Goldwater rule and is not considering implementing one\". Yahoo News reporter Michael Walsh criticized the \"Stat\" article, saying it was \"misleading\" by stating that the letter \"represents the first significant crack\": The American Psychiatric Association retains the Goldwater rule, and the APsaA never had the rule and was not changing. Also, even though the APsaA has no Goldwater rule for its members and allows its members to give individual opinions about specific political figures, its Executive Councilors unanimously endorsed a policy that \"the APsaA as an organization will speak to issues only, not about specific political figures\".\n\n"}

Martyr of the Nicaraguan Revolution. Scholars in US universities have placed her name next to Camilo Torres Restrepo, Che Guevara, José Martí in that they shared a profound sensitivity toward injustice.\n\nReligious books and works of columnists and editorials have been dedicated to her memory. Works of testimonial literature like \"Adios Muchachos\" , by Sergio Ramirez, and \"We are all awake\" by Margaret Randall, cite as an example of life. Until today her memory as such is recalled frequently in speeches and editorials in Nicaragua.\n\n\nThe second of five children. Lived her early years in Leon, Nicaragua. She was 3 years old when her family moved to the neighborhood of Subtiava, in the outskirts of Leon. Her birthday coincides with the anniversary of the Somoza's National Guard massacre on college students marching on the streets of Leon in 1956. This is, each birthday of her life was a reminder of Students Martyrs, for it was a day off in schools in Nicaragua by decree. She lived in Managua between age six and ten. In 1962 her family moved to the town of Jinotega. On Sunday family outings visited San Rafael del Norte and other surrounding towns in the mountains that witnessed Gen. Augusto César Sandino zaga in the 1930s.\n\nReturning to Managua, finished Elementary and High school at the French School of the Sacred Heart between 1965 and 1972, the same school attended by prominent personalities in Nicaragua today including ex-President of Nicaragua, Violeta Chamorro.\n\nIdania developed organizational and leadership skills as a member of the group \"Las Metanoias\" in Senior High School. The group made spiritual retreat trips to hacienda El Tepeyac, near Mombacho Volcano and Lake Nicaragua for study and discussions on the Liberation Theology. Idania turned an ardent activist and represented her school among a broad base of organizations engaged in demonstrations demanding the release of political prisoners in 1971–1972. Her activities won her a slap on the face from Sister Nicolle, the school Director, who actually feared for Idania's fate.\n\nIn 1973, her family moved to Panama and she started her college education in Economics at the University of Panama. Resumed activism joining the Solidarity Committees in support of the Sandinista Liberation Front prisoners. In 1974 She married David Miranda, a Panamanian-Nicaraguan student of Economics also. In August 1975 she gave birth to daughter Claudia, named after Claudia Chamorro another Sandinista fallen years earlier.\n\nFollowing the successful Sandinista operatives at the Chema Castillo's residence in the 1974 Christmas party with attendance of dictator Somoza's Elite, Idania had the opportunity she longed for so long. She was finally able to meet personally the Sandinistas she fought so hard for their release since her school days, upon their arrival to Panama.\n\nBecause Idania had residence in Panama since 1973, and many friends, she helped in the logistics to provide accommodations and supplies to the Sandinistas; so much, that she donated her personal belongings (furniture, appliances, books, etc.) to the safe houses in Panama where the Sandinistas were staying. It did not take long for Idania to fit perfectly in the \"organization\" (as they used to call the Sandinista National Liberation Front in Panama where they enjoyed medium security environment.\n\nIdania was considered to participate in the spectacular raid at the National Government Palace in 1978, taking 3000 hostages, which resulted in the release of several Sandinistas in captivity. Ultimately; Dora María Téllez was chosen, the only woman in the operative, named after Rigoberto López Pérez.\n\nIn 1978 following the popular insurrection in Monimbo, Masaya, 78), Idania decided to join full-time the ranks of the FSLN Command in Panama and Costa Rica, where she frequently met with members of the \"Direccion Nacional\", the highest ranking of that organization. She trained in Cuba in rocket launching in the middle of 1978. General Omar Torrijos, and the people of Panama, did not like the Somoza dictatorship and offered logistic support to the Sandinistas and also military training in the Province of Chiriqui (Panama) and she also trained there among other young cadres.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1978 Idania made trips to Nicaragua and Costa Rica on clandestine missions, including one trip to the Northern Front and different operatives, but in September 1978 she was wounded in combat on the left hand in Nicaragua near the southern border. She was taken initially to a Costa Rican hospital near the border, and her pictures appeared in Costa Rican newspapers front page referring to her only as \"Angela\", respecting her identity. Fearing for her security at the Hospital, Sergio Ramirez's wife picked her up and took her to a Sandinista makeshift hospital in Nicaragua near the border.\n\nUpon her return to Panama, the Panamanian military had assigned Secret Service security personnel to high ranking or identifiable Sandinistas including Idania. She could no longer use her real name or passport on her missions to Nicaragua either, or visit public places in Panama without escort. She was also required to carry a high caliber Magnum pistol in her purse at all times, which she did.\n\nAfter a number of spontaneous uprisings in Monimbo, Matagalpa, Estelí and other cities, where the Sandinistas were forced to fight in support of the people's uprising, rather than the opposite, a major shift in Sandinista strategy was developed. In order to take the lead of the Insurrection, two major Insurrectional Commands were organized; the Frente Interno in Managua and the Western command in the city of Leon. Idania was assigned to the newly formed Western Insurrectional Command, which required experience with the communities and base organizations (\"trabajo de barrios\"), worker unions, students, religious groups and organizing the neighborhoods for the final offensive.\n\nIn February 1979, Omar Torrijos, head of the Panamenian government invited the Grupo de Los Doce, prominent Nicaraguan businessmen backing up the Sandinistas, for talks in Panama. By this time, arms shipments from Venezuela and Cuba were under way. Dr. Joaquin Cuadra, a member of Los Doce and whose son Joaquin Cuadra, leader of the Frente Interno Sandinista Command, was in Nicaragua, invited Idania and Oscar Perez Cassar for the talks and dinner. Idania and Oscar were also members of the Frente Interno, and scheduled to go back to Nicaragua via Honduras, to assume the leadership of the Western Regional Command for the final Insurrection. Sergio Ramirez, also a member of Los Doce and a member of the upcoming Government Junta, relates that Idania attended with her hand still bandaged from surgery after her wounds in September.\n\nIn March 1979, Idania went back to Nicaragua to resume her new post in the Western Regional Command, the leading Commando of the Insurrection, and was prepared to stay indefinitely until victory or death, as a member of the ill-fated Insurrectional Command \"Rigoberto López Pérez\" headed by Dora Maria Tellez. In late 1978 the Somoza's National Guard had been killing the population without mercy in the towns of Leon, Masaya, Estelí by aerial bombing, reported by the Red Cross. That was too much to bear for the Sandinistas. It was about time to finish the Somoza's regime.\n\nTitle chosen by Sergio Ramirez for the chapter of his book \"Adios Muchachos\" dedicated to the memory of the events the day that shook the entire City of Leon, specially, and the rest of the country. On April 16, 1979 the Sandinista war was escalating fast. Combats were taking place in more than twenty cities in Nicaragua. However; most of the leaders of the soon to be Revolutionary Government were in Costa Rica or Panama in safe houses. Their role was to provide the military strategy, negotiations with foreign governments and sketching a plan for the new an imminent Nicaraguan Government Junta. The war was actually run in the field by five Regional Commands. The most important ones were the Western Command based in the City of Leon and the Frente Interno, based in Managua. They were considered critical for a fast victory. The Regional Commands had the future of Nicaragua at hand.\n\nOn that day, the Members of the Western Regional Command integrated by Oscar Perez Cassar, Idania Fernandez, Araceli Perez Darias, Ana Isabel Morales, Edgard Lang Sacasa, Roger Deshon Arguello and Carlos Manuel Jarquin were in session in a safe house in the suburbs of Leon. The National Guard was attacking heavily the City of Estelí, near the mountains and they were coordinating the efforts to help them. Reportedly, there was a whistleblower, a supposedly former Sandinista militia who turned police informant. The informant and eighty members of the National Guard, in jeeps and tanks, surrounded the block, and stormed into the house. The Sandinistas had no chance to escape or to grab their weapons. Ana Isabel put an apron on, grabbed a child form an adjacent house, and passed herself off as a domestic. She was the only survivor. The informant identified positively the men as important cadre, but he argued not knowing the women. So, all men were executed on the spot, Idania and Araceli were arrested, taken to the Fortin of Acosasco, tortured and murdered.\n\nThousands attended their funeral. The entire city of Leon (not to mention the Sandinista ranks at all levels) was enraged. The Somoza government refused to return Araceli's (who was Mexican) remains to her family. Idania's parents and two youngest sisters were living in Dallas, Texas, and contacted the Dallas Morning News. The paper dedicated a full page article on the events in the Sunday edition. Edgard Lang Sacasa was 23 and he was the son of a first cousin to dictator Somoza and a friend of a Wall Street Journal columnist, and this prompted an editorial.\n\nSoon after, as expected, the city of Leon street fighters headed by Dora Maria Tellez, Idania's comrade, increased greaty in numbers and firepower. In June the victory over the Somoza forces in Leon was complete, followed by Managua, two weeks later, and the Somoza regime went with it.\n\n\"I leave you an example of life, mine\", wrote Idania to her daughter in her farewell letters. Reprinted in Margaret Randall's book \"Todas Estamos Despiertas\".\nand many columnists' and editorial pages in Nicaragua countless times over the last twenty nine years.\nErnesto Cardenal, Sergio Ramirez and other dissidents of the Sandinistas often quote Idania's writings and ideals. This is a true legacy and probably the best.\n\nAfter her death, Idania firepower increased thousandfold. In 1984, at the peak of the Contra war, one of the largest battalions of the Sandinista People's Army (Ejército Popular Sandinista), dispatched to the Northern Front to fight the Contras, was named after her.\n\nOccasionally, they name a nursery or police station after Idania but there are no monuments or statues for her in Nicaragua. She would probably have liked it this way. We have seen so many statues fall in world history, but an example of life lasts forever.\n\n"}

It is a pseudoscientific supernatural explanation of the effects of gravity. The joke originated on Usenet, and has appeared in several online parodies. An article about Intelligent Falling in \"The Onion\" described free fall as being caused by \"the hand of God\".\n\nIntelligent Falling proposes that the scientific explanation of gravitational force cannot explain all aspects of the phenomenon, so credence should be given to the idea that things fall because a higher intelligence is moving them. Furthermore, IF asserts that theories explaining gravity are not internally consistent nor mathematically reconcilable with quantum mechanics, making gravity a \"theory in crisis\". IF also makes the claim that gravity is \"only a theory\", parodying the claims made by creationists regarding the theoretical status of evolution. IF apologists jokingly advocate that IF should be taught in school along with the theory of gravity so that students can make \"an informed decision\" on the subject in a parody of the demands to \"teach the controversy\".\n\nIn June 2002 a user named Jeff Stubbs posted a draft of a letter to the editor that mentions \"intelligent grappling\" to the alt.atheism and talk.origins usenet groups.

{"id": "501587", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=501587", "title": "Interactive storytelling", "text": "Interactive storytelling\n\nInteractive storytelling (also known as interactive drama) is a form of digital entertainment in which the storyline is not predetermined. The author creates the setting, characters, and situation which the narrative must address, but the user (also reader or player) experiences a unique story based on their interactions with the story world. The architecture of an interactive storytelling program includes a drama manager, user model, and agent model to control, respectively, aspects of narrative production, player uniqueness, and character knowledge and behavior. Together, these systems generate characters that act \"human,\" alter the world in real-time reactions to the player, and ensure that new narrative events unfold comprehensibly.\n\nThe field of study surrounding interactive storytelling encompasses many disparate fields, including psychology, sociology, cognitive science, linguistics, natural language processing, user interface design, computer science, and emergent intelligence. They fall under the umbrella term of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), at the intersection of hard science and the humanities. The difficulty of producing an effective interactive storytelling system is attributed to the ideological division between professionals in each field: artists have trouble constraining themselves to logical and linear systems and programmers are disinclined to appreciate or incorporate the abstract and unproven concepts of the humanities.\n\nWhat characteristics distinguish an interactive story from another form of interactive media is subject to much debate. Interactivity and storytelling are both polysemic terms, and the phrase \"interactive storytelling\" does not inherently distinguish it from other kinds of storytelling, many of which are already interactive to some extent. Some of the literature associated with the term \"interactive storytelling\" is actually about transmedia storytelling, which is not a form of entertainment, but a marketing strategy for building a compelling brand across digital platforms. Varying levels of interactivity are a function of the \"relatedness of transmitted messages with previous exchanges of information where sender and receiver roles become interchangeable.\" Storytelling, in this case, refers to the process of active creation and authoring rather than the final product and its passive reception. Interactive storytelling by this definition can entail any media that allows the user to generate several unique dramatic narratives. Though its final goal is a fully unauthored AI environment with a comprehensive human-level understanding of narrative construction (i.e., the Holodeck), projects that use branching stories and variable gates are considered experimental prototypes in the same genre.\n\nInteractive storytelling is defined as distinct from interactive fiction (or IF), as well as video games with strong narrative focus (Mass Effect, BioShock, etc.), by user agency and open-ended narrative. David Gaider, an RPG developer at BioWare, stated that \"every possible branch needs to be written and fully realized, even if not every player sees it, and thus any game which allows for a lot of player choice becomes a much more expensive proposition for a developer.\" IF and video games, to balance user choice with authorial effort, must constrain the directions the narrative can take with puzzles, battles, or unchangeable plot points and bottlenecks, all of which detract from a sense of immersion. Only the most critical of the user's narrative choices are used or remembered in narrative development, according to the need to fulfill specific player goals that define a \"gameplay\" experience. A true IS system would incorporate all of them, as do living human agents, simultaneously and continuously - a task only artificial intelligence can meet. Sandbox games like \"The Sims\" and \"Spore\", which do involve extensive AI-based social interaction, do not manage dramatic tension or produce a cohesive narrative .\n\nTo Mateas and Stern, creators of \"Façade\" and \"The Party\", interactive storytelling is best understood as interactive theater, in that its goal is dramatic meaning rather than fun. It was Chris Crawford who coined the term interactive storytelling in the 90s, arguing that IS is not a video game with a narrative, and that a game and IS cannot be combined successfully. Because of limited technology and the amount of work required, it is still difficult to combine a robust interactive storytelling system and a game engine without detracting from the effectiveness of both.\n\nEmerging voices in the field, however, argue for the possibilities of adding narrative complexity and realistic characters to existing video game genres. Using MADE (Massive Artificial Drama Engine), a team of AI researchers developed a Genetic Algorithm to guide emergent behavior for secondary non-player characters (NPCs) based on literary archetypes . In the open-source AI engine of TES: Skyrim, this was tested to elaborate on the mechanistic behavior of townspeople:\nEarly attempts to understand interactive storytelling date back to the 1970s with such efforts as Roger Schank's research at Northwestern University and the experimental program TaleSpin . In the early 1980s Michael Liebowitz developed \"Universe\", a conceptual system for a kind of interactive storytelling. In 1986, Brenda Laurel published her PhD dissertation, \"Toward the Design of a Computer-Based Interactive Fantasy System.\"\n\nDuring the 1990s, a number of research projects began to appear, such as the Oz Project led by Dr. Joseph Bates and Carnegie Mellon University, the Software Agents group at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Improv Project led by Ken Perlin at New York University, and the Virtual Theater group at Stanford, led by Dr. Barbara Hayes-Roth.\n\nThere were also a number of conferences touching upon these subjects, such as the Workshop on Interactive Fiction & Synthetic Realities in 1990; Interactive Story Systems: Plot & Character at Stanford in 1995; the AAAI Workshop on AI and Entertainment, 1996; Lifelike Computer Characters, Snowbird, Utah, October 1996; the First International Conference on Autonomous Agents at Marina del Rey, CA. February 5–8, 1997.\n\nThe first conference to directly address the research area was the 1st International Conference on Technologies for Interactive Digital Storytelling and Entertainment, which took place in March 2003 and focused specifically on concepts and first prototypes for automated storytelling and autonomous characters, including modeling of emotions and the user experience. The concepts were developed by Chris Crawford, in his 2005 book.\n\nIn the 2000s, work on interactive storytelling and related topics expanded, and was presented at events including the alternating bi-yearly conferences, TIDSE (Conference on Technologies for Interactive Digital Storytelling and Entertainment) and ICVS (International Conference on Virtual Storytelling), hosted in Germany and France, respectively. TIDSE and ICVS were superseded by ICIDS (International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling), a yearly event established in 2008.\n\nThe first published interactive storytelling software that was widely recognized as the \"real thing\" was \"Façade\", created by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. The system was publicly released in 2006, and was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Slamdance Independent Games Festival.\n\nThe architecture of an interactive storytelling system has three component parts: a drama manager, a user model, and an agent model. The drama manager is responsible for guiding the narrative by searching and executing story \"beats\" in a coherent sequence, refining story events by providing new information and reconciling contradictory plots, and collaborating with the agent model to choose the best narrative actions for the characters . It monitors a number of overview variables in the storyworld to make the best decision for the narrative, defined by the goals of the author: a measure of worldwide conflict would help to increase or decrease dramatic tension, while measures of relationships and likability could guide a story towards a romantic storyline. The agent model collects information about the story world and characters and generates possible actions in response for each non-player character in the story. Possible actions are drawn from the personality and emotional model of the character, allowing each one to exhibit autonomous behavior with intelligent dramatic goals . Finally, the user model keeps track of player choices and inputs, such that the drama manager and agent model can cooperate with the way the user attempts to play rather than challenging or misunderstanding their decisions.\n\nCrawford discusses three potential strategies for developing interactive storytelling systems. Firstly, environmental approaches are those which take an interactive system, such as a computer game, and encourage the actions of a user in such a way as to form a coherent plot. With a sufficiently complex system, emergent behavior may form story-like behavior regardless of the user's actions.\n\nSecondly, data-driven strategies have a library of \"story components\" which are sufficiently general that they can be combined smoothly in response to a user's actions (or lack thereof). This approach has the advantage of being more general that the directed environmental approach, at the cost of a much larger initial investment.\n\nFinally, language-based approaches require that the user and system share some, very limited, domain-specific language so that they can react to each other and the system can 'understand' a greater proportion of the users actions. Crawford suggests approaches that only use, for example, pictorial languages or restricted versions of English.\n\nPlanning-based systems can be integrated into any of the above approaches to ensure narrative cohesion. The system does this by anticipating potential holes in the plot and repairing them by introducing new information and events. Two such systems include Automated Story Director (ASD), which forms narrative repairs based on plot points predefined by the author, and Player-Specific Automated Storytelling (PAST), which chooses from several possible repairs according to the player's previous behaviors. PAST characterizes a player along five vectors of style based on Robin Laws' work on player types—fighter, power gamer, storyteller, method actor, and tactician—and may choose to solve a broken plot point for a fighter by adding a battle with a new character, or for a storyteller by adding new background information that justifies the break.\n\nFrom the background of a multimedia author, media director and designer Eku Wand describes further strategies which are related to structure, space, time and perspective. \n\nThe success of an interactive storytelling experience depends on a balanced dramatic structure and user agency. A dramatically interesting narrative experience is one that moderates tension between characters and events over time, such that conflicts arise logically and are not left without resolution. It must also differ noticeably on every \"playthrough\" as a function of the user's freedom to interact with characters and objects in the virtual world. This can be achieved to varying degrees of success by branching, emergent, character-driven, and plot-driven systems, but no existing system fully achieves a lifelike experience. AIs do not yet have a human grasp of the rules of drama and narrative, so existing interactive dramas produce a limited number of significantly different story outcomes, relative to the amount of labor required of the author.\n\nThere have been several attempts at formalizing an evaluation system for interactive dramas, despite the fact that all existing projects are still in experimental stages. Player agency and fun remain the primary concerns, though fun is often exchanged for more narrative-specific metrics, like \"interestingness\" and \"suspense.\" Likert scales filled out by players create a rough quantitative picture of user experience, but leave out much of the subjective interpretation that lies behind complex human interactions.\n\nMehta et al. focused on conversation-centric systems to develop qualitative metrics for the user's successful engagements, instead of quantitative measures of \"inappropriate utterances\" (in which the AI misunderstands player input and responds nonsensically) and other technical failures. After a \"breakdown\" in conversation, how effectively the user incorporates it into the overall understanding of the characters and story depends on design features. In their study of Façade, some AI actor breakdowns include shallow semantic understanding, inverted meanings, and the timing of responses. Artificially intelligent agents have trouble translating ambiguous user input into the limited narrative meaning system, as when \"sad\" or \"hurt\" is interpreted only as a reference to clinical depression. Similarly, negative and positive user sentiments are often confused with one another, especially if a positive statement is preceded by disagreement with a negative one. This is exacerbated if a user cannot send a reply fast enough - their utterance is understood as referring to the most recent speaker, leading to unintended interactions. However, background information is referenced often enough for a player to invent narrative justifications for apparently strange behaviors, which most participants did. \n\n\"The Oz Project\" was an attempt in the early 1990s to use intelligent agent technology to attack the challenges in IS. Its architecture included a simulated physical world, several characters, an interactor, a theory of presentation, and a drama manager. Users communicated with the system using either a text based or graphical interface .\n\n\"Façade\" is an artificial-intelligence-based approach created by Michael Mateas and Andrew Stern. It was the winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Slamdance Independent Games Festival and is recognized as the first true interactive storytelling software. It is text based and uses natural language processing and other artificial intelligence routines to direct the action .\n\nThe \"Hybrid Evolutionary-Fuzzy Time-based Interactive\" (HEFTI) storytelling system was produced at the University of Texas at Austin and uses genetic algorithms to recombine and evaluate story components generated from a set of story templates. Although Crawford described it as the \"wrong approach to development systems [...] incomprehensible to the kind of creative talent needed for storytelling,\" it continues to be discussed as a research and approach and genetic algorithm continue to be considered a potential tool for use in the area.\n\nFiga and Tarau have used WordNet to build technologies useful to interactive storytelling. This approach defines 'story traces' as an abstract reduction (or skeleton) of a story, and 'story projection' as a fragment of a story that can be treated as a single dramatic building block. This work seeks to build up large repositories of narrative forms in such a way that these forms can later be combined .\n\nAs defined by Stephen Dinehart, Interactive narrative design combines ludology, narratology and game design to form interactive entertainment development methodologies. Interactive entertainment experiences allow the player to witness data as navigable, participatory, and dramatic in real-time: “a narratological craft which focuses on the structuralist, or literary semiotic creation of stories.\" Interactive Narrative design seeks to accomplish this via viewer/user/player (VUP) navigated dataspaces \n\nInteractive narrative design focuses on creating meaningful participatory story experiences with interactive systems. The aim is to transport the player through play into the videogame (dataspace) using their visual and auditory senses. When interactive narrative design is successful, the VUP (viewer/user/player) believes that they are experiencing a story.\n\nStory possibilities are not precisely calculable, and are represented as orders, such that O(10) would be in the order of tens of stories, and O(1) would be fewer than 10 unique story possibilities.\n\n\n\n"}

The song is a humorous look at the Jewish-American princess stereotype which attracted attention from the Anti-Defamation League, to which Zappa denied an apology, arguing: \"Unlike the unicorn, such creatures do exist — and deserve to be 'commemorated' with their own special opus\". In an interview with \"Spin\" magazine he was almost offended saying, \"…as if to say there is no such thing as a Jewish Princess.

This led to the rumor that a legal action had been filed against Zappa, a charge he vehemently denied in a CNN interview on \"The Freeman Report\" show of October 26, 1981. Zappa claimed that offensive songs such as this are why \"Sheik Yerbouti\" became one of his best selling albums of all time.

She is the Carol Zicklin Endowed Chair in the Honors Academy at Brooklyn College, City University of New York and a Senior Research Fellow with the Global Health Justice Partnership at Yale University. She has written widely on testosterone, intersex issues, sex verification in sports, treatment practices, policy and lived experiences, and the interface between medicine and society. In 2016, she was jointly awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship with Rebecca Jordan-Young.\n\nKatrina Karkazis received her PhD in medical and cultural anthropology, and a Masters in Public Health in maternal and child health, from Columbia University. She has an undergraduate degree in Public Policy from Occidental College. Karkazis has since completed postdoctoral training in empirical bioethics at Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics. She is the Carol Zicklin Endowed Chair in the Honors Academy at Brooklyn College, City University of New York, and a Senior Visiting Fellow with the Global Health Justice Partnership at Yale University.\n\nIn 2008, Karkazis published her first book, \"Fixing Sex\", on the medical treatment and lived experience of intersex people. Since publication of \"Fixing Sex\" and co-authoring a 2012 journal article on sex testing in sport, \"Out of Bounds\", Karkazis has widely written and been quoted as an expert on issues of informed consent, bodily diversity, testosterone, and access to sport. Media coverage of sport issues includes American Association for the Advancement of Science, \"The Guardian\", \"Los Angeles Times\", \"New Scientist\", \"New York Times\" and \"Time\", often in collaboration with Rebecca Jordan-Young.\n\nIn 2015, Karkazis testified before the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in the case of \"Dutee Chand v. Athletics Federation of India (AFI) & The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF)\", and in July 2015 the CAS issued a decision to suspend its sex verification policy on excluding women athletes with hyperandrogenism (high levels of testosterone) due to insufficient evidence of a link between high androgen levels and improved athletic performance. The court allowed two further years for convincing evidence to be submitted by the IAAF, after which the regulation will be automatically revoked if evidence has not been provided.\n\nIn 2016, Karkazis was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship by the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation to work on a book on testosterone, \"T: The Unauthorized Biography\", with co-author Rebecca Jordan-Young. In 2018, Karkazis wrote in The New York Review of Books that \"T has become a powerful technology for the production of subjectivity, the most consequential of which is gender.\"\n\n\"Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience\", published by Duke University Press in 2008 presents a history of the medical treatment and lived experience of intersex people and their families. The book has been well received by both clinicians and intersex groups. Gary Berkovitz, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine states that Karkazis's analysis is fair, compelling, and eloquent. Elizabeth Reis, reviewing the book in American Journal of Bioethics, states that the book \"masterfully examines the concerns and fears of all those with a stake in the intersex debate: physicians, parents, intersex adults, and activists.\" Mijeon, in American Journal of Human Genetics writes that the \"conclusion is quite fitting\", \"the history of thinking about the body ... can be highly politicized and controversial\". Kenneth Copeland MD, former president of the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society describes the book as, \"Masterfully balancing all aspects of one of the most polarizing, contentious topics in medicine... the most recent authoritative treatise on intersex.\" Intersex community organization Organisation Intersex International Australia regards the book as \"approachable,\" \"compelling and recommended reading\", and the book was subsequently cited by the Senate of Australia in 2013.\n\nIn \"Out of Bounds? A Critique of the New Policies on Hyperandrogenism in Elite Female Athletes\", a collaborative article with Georgiann Davis, Rebecca Jordan-Young, and Silvia Camporesi, published in 2012 in the \"American Journal of Bioethics\", they argue that a new sex testing policy by the International Association of Athletics Federations will not protect against breaches of privacy, will require athletes to undergo unnecessary treatment in order to compete, and will intensify \"gender policing\". They recommend that athletes be able to compete in accordance with their legal gender. The analysis was described as an \"influential critique\" in the \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nIn \"Emotionally and cognitively informed consent for clinical care for differences of sex development\", co-authored with Anne Tamar-Mattis, Arlene Baratz, and Katherine Baratz Dalke and published in 2013, the authors write that \"physicians continue to recommend certain irreversible treatments for children with differences of sex development (DSD) without adequate psychosocial support\".\n\nIn \"What’s in a Name? The Controversy over “Disorders of Sex Development”\", co-authored with Ellen Feder and published in 2008, the authors state that \"tracing \"the history of the terminology applied to those with atypical sex anatomy reveals how these conditions have been narrowly cast as problems of gender to the neglect of broader health concerns and of the well-being of affected individuals.\" Karkazis and Feder also collaborated in \"Naming the problem: disorders and their meanings\", published in \"The Lancet\" in 2008.\n\n\n\n\"\" was nominated for the Margaret Mead Award, 2010, and a finalist for the Lambda Literary Award, 2009.

{"id": "659127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=659127", "title": "Leonard J. Arrington", "text": "Leonard J. Arrington\n\nLeonard James Arrington (July 2, 1917 – February 11, 1999) was an American author, academic and the founder of the Mormon History Association. He is known as the \"Dean of Mormon History\" and \"the Father of Mormon History\" because of his many influential contributions to the field. He was the first Church Historian for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1972 to 1982, and was director of the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History from 1982 until 1986. \nArrington grew up in a large family in Idaho, where he and his family were members of the LDS Church. After high school, he studied agricultural economics at the University of Idaho and continued studying economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While teaching at the Utah State Agricultural College in Logan, Utah, Harvard University Press published his book \"Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830–1900\" in 1958. After a Fulbright professorship at the University of Genoa in Italy, Arrington raised funds to pay for research and writing on LDS (Mormon) biographies. He taught Western American History at Brigham Young University (BYU) from 1972 to 1987.\n\nIn conjunction with his teaching appointment at BYU, Arrington was also appointed as the first Church Historian for the LDS Church from 1972 to 1982. It was the first time a professional historian was given this job. Arrington and his team of researchers, forming the church Historical Department, began many projects to document LDS Church history, ranging from articles for the church's official magazine to scholarly books written for a non-LDS audience. The Historical Department was not subject to the church's Correlation Program and enjoyed some freedom of research. However, over time, various church members and apostles disliked the historical articles. The new director of the Historical Department, G. Homer Durham, required that all publications go through him and halted the hiring of new employees. In 1982, the LDS Church released Arrington as Church Historian and transferred the History Division to BYU, creating the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History. Arrington published over 20 books and articles, including several biographies, with the help of many research assistants.\n\nArrington donated his research and personal papers to Utah State University, and also donated microfilms of his pre-1982 diaries to the LDS Church Archives, with the condition that the diaries not be read until 25 years after his death. However, the LDS Church broke the agreement when shortly after Arrington's death they argued that they owned part of the collection, and asked Arrington's daughter to excise portions of Arrington's diary. After legal negotiation, half of a box of the collection was given to the LDS Church Archives.\n\nLeonard Arrington was born in Twin Falls, Idaho on July 2, 1917, the third of eleven children. His parents, Noah and Edna, were farmers and devout Latter-day Saints, the most well-known branch of Mormonism. Arrington grew up as an aspiring farmer and active member and one of the first national officers of the National FFA Organization. For his FFA independent project, he raised several hundred Rhode Island Red chickens and won a prize for them at the Idaho State Fair in 1934. The chicken project helped him win a Union Pacific Railroad scholarship.\n\nArrington was also a member of the Boy Scouts and read books by Ernest Thompson Seton, naturalist co-founder of the Boy Scouts. In the summers, he slept outside in the family orchard to have a quiet place to read and enjoyed an idyllic country life. On one evening observing nature, Arrington had a transcendent experience where he felt \"an intimate kinship with the world\" which he said \"made it easy for me [...] to integrate personal religious experiences and intuitions with the more formal affirmations, practices, forms, and ceremonies of the organized church.\"\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Arrington was curious about the price of potatoes and set about his first economic experiment. He put slips of paper in some of the sacks of potatoes his family harvested, with the information that the potatoes were sold for five cents per hundred pound sack, and requested that the recipient tell him the price they paid via his address. Several people responded, and one person had paid two dollars for the same sack of potatoes.\n\nArrington's father offered to pay for Arrington to serve as an LDS missionary, but not for a university education. Arrington did not serve an LDS mission, but considered his educational endeavors a form of church service. Under a scholarship to the University of Idaho, Arrington studied agricultural science in 1935, later changing to agricultural economics. George S. Tanner, the director of the LDS Institute at the University of Idaho, was a progressive intellectual Mormon who taught Arrington that Christianity and science could be compatible and that other translations of the Bible could assist in its interpretation. One of the university's newest economics professors, Erwin Graue, taught the ideas of Alfred Marshall and influenced Arrington to see economics as a study of human relationships and not just mathematical economic forces. Marshall wrote that religious fervor could influence people to act altruistically.\n\nArrington graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1939. Arrington then began graduate work under a Kenan teaching fellowship at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. and married Grace Fort in 1942. Grace joined the LDS Church in 1946.\n\nIn World War II, he served in the Army in North Africa and Italy from 1942 to 1945. He worked in the prisoner-of-war processing division and for Italy's Institute of Statistics. While stationed at a Prisoner-of-war camp for Italian prisoners in North Africa, Arrington reported having another transcendent experience after reading \"The Brothers Karamazov\". He reported feeling that God wanted him to become a teacher and a writer about religion and economics.\n\nHe was a professor at Utah State Agricultural College in Logan, Utah (which became Utah State University in 1957) from 1946 to 1972. He completed a PhD in economics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1952, taking a year's leave from teaching and moving to North Carolina to complete his coursework. Arrington easily completed the coursework and examinations, as he had already been teaching much of the material, and published several articles in the meantime.\n\nIn 1958, Harvard University Press published Arrington's \"Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830–1900\", based on his doctoral dissertation, \"Mormon Economic Policies and Their Implementation on the Western Frontier, 1847–1900\". \"Great Basin Kingdom\" was published through a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, which subsidized publication of books about economic history. Under the grant, all royalties went back into the fund to help publish more books; Arrington did not receive royalties from the book until the University of Utah reprinted it in 1993.\n\nArrington completed much of the research for \"Great Basin Kingdom\" in the LDS Church library archives. Aware of the LDS Church Archives's hostility to academic research at the time, Arrington took John A. Widtsoe's advice and started his research with published materials and theses, working up to unpublished materials. Arrington was able to circumvent A. William Lund's policy of personally approving all notes taken in the archives: Arrington took his notes on a typewriter using carbon copy paper, enabling him to leave a copy with Lund and take his own copy home. In order to rewrite his dissertation into \"Great Basin Kingdom\", Arrington took a sabbatical 1956–1957 and was granted a fellowship at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.\n\nIn \"Great Basin Kingdom\", Arrington traces the Mormon pioneer practices of \"central planning, organized cooperation, and the partial socialization of investment implicit in Mormon theory\" to the democratic theory of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Arrington also noted that pioneers found religious significance in creating farms out of previously wild land, making irrigation central to their way of life. The way Mormons freely distributed irrigation water—through a central canal and diverted when needed—reflected their communal values. While the Mormon cooperative economy died out in the 1880s, their cooperative spirit anticipated later governmental planning. \"Great Basin Kingdom\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s thorough documentation called attention to previously hidden sources in the LDS Church Archives. Dean L. May and Donald Worster criticized \"Great Basin Kingdom\" for overreaching its thesis that organized irrigation could rejuvenate a culture. One biographer attributes Arrington's overvaluing Mormon achievements to a lack of empirical studies on pioneer settlements at the time. Still, the book was received as an instant classic that raised the standard for Mormon scholarship. Dale L. Morgan, though critical of the lack of attention to the Gentile (i.e., non-Mormon) influence on Mormons, said that it was an indispensable ordering of Mormon data. The book is still considered one of the significant books on Mormon history.\n\nFrom 1958 to 1959, he was a Fulbright Professor of American Economics at the University of Genoa in Italy. After returning from Italy, Arrington arranged for donations from patrons to fund the writing of Mormon biographies. Much of these biographies were researched and written by graduate students and other assistants, but published under Arrington's name with acknowledgements of the student work. Also in 1959, Arrington wrote an article featured in the first issue of \"BYU Studies\" entitled \"An Economic Interpretation of 'The Word of Wisdom.'\" The article argued that Brigham Young's enforcement of the Word of Wisdom as a commandment was motivated by a desire to keep cash inside Utah (and not spent on luxury imports). \"BYU Studies\" was suspended for a year, which Ernest L. Wilkinson told Arrington was because of his revisionist history paper.\n\nFrom 1966 to 1967 he worked as a visiting professor of history at the University of California, Los Angeles. From 1972 to 1987 he was Lemuel H. Redd Jr. Professor of Western American History at BYU. In 1977, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Idaho (his alma mater), and in 1982 Utah State University awarded him an Honorary Doctor of Humanities degree.\n\nArrington helped establish the Mormon History Association in 1965 and served as its first president from 1966 to 1967. After Arrington's article caused the suspension of \"BYU studies\", \"BYU Studies\" was wary of publishing any controversial material. Arrington formed the Mormon History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone with an interest in Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in \"Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought\", a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted and members of the Mormon History Association submitted papers to \"Dialogue\".\n\nArrington also founded the \"Western Historical Quarterly\" and served as president of the Western History Association (1968–69), the Agricultural History Society (1969–70), and the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association (1981–82). For his distinction in writing American history he was awarded the Western History Association Prize in 1984 and he was made a Fellow of the Society of American Historians in 1986.\n\nN. Eldon Tanner was made second counselor to the president of the LDS Church, David O. McKay, in 1963. Tanner met with the director of the BYU library at the time, S. Lyman Tyler, to coordinate LDS historians' work with the LDS Church Archives. Arrington began attending these meetings in 1966. In 1967, Arrington indicated that publisher Knopf was interested in publishing a general history of Mormons, and asked for unrestricted access to the LDS Church Archives, which he was granted in January 1968.\nAfter McKay died in 1970, the LDS Church Historian Joseph Fielding Smith succeeded him as church President. This left the position of official Church Historian—which was traditionally held by a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles—vacant. Apostle Howard W. Hunter was chosen as the next Church Historian, and he formed a committee of prominent Mormon historians to discuss reorganizing the church history department. As part of this reorganization, Arrington was appointed official Church Historian of The LDS Church, replacing Howard W. Hunter, in January 1972. At the same time, Arrington was appointed as \"Lemuel H. Redd Professor of Western History\" and Founding Director of the \"Charles Redd Center for Western Studies\" at BYU; his historian position was funded half by the church and half by BYU. The Church Historian's Office was transformed into the church's Historical Department, and Arrington was made director of its research-oriented History Division. It was the first time a professional historian rather than an administrator was given a church historian position. He hired Jim Allen and David Bitton as assistant church historians, whose positions were also funded half by the church and half by their universities.\n\nArrington and his assistants were supported by a team of editors, administrative assistants, research historians, oral history experts, and student interns. It was common for many individuals to work on a project; generally the principle author was listed in the article's byline, but sometimes Arrington's name was used to lend a publication authority. As a supervisor, Arrington was not a skillful bureaucrat, and junior staffers complained about their exclusion from decision-making and a lack of communication, which Arrington tried to ameliorate. Richard Bushman, a prominent Mormon historian, suggested that Arrington commission a multivolume history of the church, written mostly by scholars outside the history division staff. William Hartley, Gordon Irving, and Gary Shumway began an oral history program, funded by a grant from the descendants of James Moyle, a Utah politician. A summer research fellowship offered $1000 for outside scholars to use the LDS Church Archives for projects on Mormon history. Eugene England Sr. also donated money to support projects that Arrington deemed especially important. Additionally, a special Mormon History Trust Fund was formed from individual donations, including royalties donated by staff members.\n\nDuring his time in the office, Arrington sponsored authors to write academic LDS Church histories. Among the best known works from this \"New Mormon History\" were two general Church histories, one aimed at LDS Church members, \"The Story of the Latter-day Saints\", and one for interested outsiders, \"The Mormon Experience: A History of the Latter-day Saints\". Arrington also granted liberal access to church archival material to both Mormon and non-Mormon scholars. Arrington continued to professionalize the archives with the systematic cataloging started by Joseph Fielding Smith. This era is sometimes referred to as \"Camelot\" due to its open and idealistic ethos. The division's output was not subject to the LDS Church's Correlation Program. The Correlation Program edited officially published church materials, like instruction manuals and magazines, to ensure that they presented a consistent message that LDS Church authorities agreed on. Arrington, Bitton, Allen, and Maureen Beecher served as a reading committee for the division's writings in place of formal Correlation approval. Arrington wanted to avoid the Correlation Program, stating that \"I do not think we could determine the truth of what had happened in history by having the Quorum of the Twelve vote on it.\"\n\nThe open and idealistic ethos did not last. The History Division's immediate supervisors, Joseph Anderson and G. Homer Durham, failed to defend the division. Spies within the department, under the instruction of Mark E. Petersen, compiled what they believed to be heretical statements and passed them along to the Twelve Apostles and ultimately the offender's bishop (local ecclesiastical authority). In a meeting with the first presidency in 1973, LDS Church President Harold B. Lee rejected proposals for a student research award and for a Friends of the Church History organization. Lee preferred that researchers clear sensitive archive research topics like polygamy with the first presidency ahead of time. Staff historian D. Michael Quinn published an article in the LDS Church magazine, the \"Ensign\", exploring the origins of the office of presiding bishop, and asserted that Edward Partridge was not the first incumbent. Although Quinn's research was correct, space in the \"Ensign\" did not permit a complete documentation of Quinn's research, and some readers felt the article insulted Partridge's memory. Apostle Spencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington submit an apology to readers; Arrington sent a message to the publisher with his regrets that the article's format was unfortunate.\n\nWhile many readers praised the division's publications, some members criticized the new histories. In a meeting with institute teachers, Ezra Taft Benson, then president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, obliquely criticized some of the terms used in \"The Story of the Latter-day Saints\", like \"primitivist\" and \"communitarian\". After the publication of Dean C. Jessee's \"Letters of Brigham Young to His Sons\", Boyd K. Packer, then an apostle, wrote a letter to the first presidency objecting to the inclusion of Young's tobacco use and the fact that his descendants were unhappy with the way Young's will was carried out. Packer preferred that a sanitized version be published and believed that the History Division's work ought to be sent through the Correlation Program. However, President Kimball found \"The Story of the Latter-Day Saints\" a \"great work.\" A University of Utah undergraduate wrote a research paper connecting the New Mormon History coming from the Church Division with secularism and the work of anti-Mormon historians Jerald and Sandra Tanner. The paper quoted interviews with Mormon historians that were very unlikely to have been real. A copy of the paper reached the Quorum of the Twelve via Mark Petersen, and as a result of the ensuing discussion, several LDS historians were barred from publishing in church sources. Other critics were similarly non-confrontational, but had enough influence to constrain and redirect the historical department.\n\nG. Homer Durham, a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy, replaced Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division's activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go through him for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust Fund with the general department budget, but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume church history project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not be tempted to sanitize church history. Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started from the History Division project were later published through other publishers.\n\nThe Church transferred its History Division to BYU in 1982, bringing the era of open LDS Church Archives to a close. Working in a new BYU division, the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History, brought Arrington into a more static situation, as he no longer divided his time between Church Headquarters and BYU. In February 1982, he was privately released as Church Historian and director of the History Division. These positions were assumed by Durham, who said that moving the team would save them from the increasing hostility from the Twelve Apostles. At the April 1982 General Conference, the change was not formally announced and Arrington did not receive the traditional vote of thanks for his service.\n\nIn March 1982, Arrington's wife Grace died. Arrington married Harriet Horne, granddaughter of Alice Merrill Horne, in November 1983. Arrington continued on as director of the Joseph Fielding Smith Institute for Church History until 1986 and he retired in 1987. In 2005, the Institute was closed and the department's historians were returned to LDS Church Headquarters.\n\nRoland Rich Woolley, lawyer for several Hollywood celebrities, funded three biographies by Arrington. The first was a biography of Woolley's father-in-law, William Spry. Woolley first hired popular writer William L. Roper to write the biography, but as the manuscript lacked professionalism, Roper hired Arrington to complete it. The biography focuses disproportionately on Spry's decision to execute Joe Hill, reflecting Woolley's conservative politics in suppressing labor radicalism.\n\nWoolley's choice of subjects for two additional biographies were his grandfathers Charles C. Rich and Edwin D. Woolley. With these biographies, Woolley gave Arrington complete control over the manuscripts. As Arrington was busy with university commitments at the time, he delegated much of the work to other historians, former students, and administrative assistants. The sources on Rich did not provide any introspection or motives for Rich's actions, and his biography had to focus on the events Rich experienced and his faithfulness, deduced from his actions. Edwin Wooley's letters and personal documents were more personable, and his role as financial adviser to Brigham Young made him a more fruitful subject for biography. Rebecca Cornwall wrote most of the book, and Arrington requested that she be named a co-author, but Woolley insisted that only Arrington's name be in the book's byline. \"From Quaker to Latter-day Saint: Bishop Edwin D. Woolley\" reflect's Cornwall's literary elegance and boldness in \"informed speculation.\"\n\nAnother wealthy family, the Eccles, commissioned Arrington to write a biography of David Eccles, a millionaire who helped form the industrial economy in Utah. David Eccles was a polygamist, and the descendants of his two wives, Bertha Jensen in Ogden and Ellen Stoddard in Logan, did not agree about how the biography should be written. Nora Harrison from the Logan part of the family originally commissioned the biography, but did not own enough material for the necessary research. Cleone Eccles, David's daughter-in-law from the Ogden side of the family, wanted a biography that focused on only positive things about David Eccles, while Harrison wanted a professional, scholarly work. In order to access Cleone Eccles's collection of David Eccles's manuscripts, Harrison agreed to give Cleone the right to make alterations to the text. Arrington employed JoAnn Bair to do the research and first drafts of the work. Harrison was unhappy with the manuscript and paid their neighbor and writer Wallace Stegner to critique the manuscript; his 15-page guidelines advised the writer to engage the reader through cliffhangers, flashbacks, and speculation. Stegner also found the manuscript too gentle on David Eccles's fraudulent business dealings. To appease Harrison, Arrington had Maureen Ursenbach Beecher improve the manuscript's literary style, but the final biography still lacked real criticism of Eccles's business practices.\n\nSpencer W. Kimball suggested that Arrington write a serious biography of Brigham Young, and Arrington paid assistants for the project out of his own pocket, possibly to insulate it from donor influences. Arrington wrote the in-depth biography with help from many of his associates at the History Division. One of Arrington's biographers, Gary Topping, praised the research in \"Brigham Young: American Moses\", but criticized its lack of psychological depth, missing the opportunity to re-examine the Mountain Meadows massacre and how Young's wives were treated.\n\nArrington also worked on biographies for Harold Silver, Madelyn Silver, and Charles Redd, with funding from their respective families. Arrington also worked on a biography for Alice Merrill Horne.\n\nDuring research on his dissertation, Arrington found a manuscript from 1946 by Feramorz Fox about Mormon communitarianism. Arrington found the manuscript fascinatingly free of Marxist thought and together with Dean L. May, revised and expanded the manuscript under the title \"Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation among the Mormons.\" Deseret Book published the book in 1976. The book was received poorly at LDS Church Headquarters; Deseret Book was not allowed to reprint the book and \"Church News\" was not permitted to review it. Fellow historians found the book well-researched but too willing to give Mormonism credit for modern welfare programs.\n\nArrington remained an active and devoted member of the LDS Church throughout his life. In 1982, his wife Grace Fort died, and in 1983 Arrington was remarried to Harriett Ann Horne. On February 11, 1999 at the age of 81, Arrington died of heart failure at his home in Salt Lake City.\n\nStarting in 1999 after his death, the Mormon History Association created the annual Leonard J. Arrington Award, awarded for distinguished and meritorious service to Mormon history. In 2002 he was posthumously awarded the first annual Lifetime Achievement Award by the John Whitmer Historical Association. In 2005, Utah State University created the Leonard J. Arrington Chair in Mormon History and Culture, which was sponsored by more than 45 donors. This chair is the first position at a public institution specifically for the study of Mormon history and culture. In Fall 2007, this chair was first filled by Philip Barlow. The university hosts the Leonard J. Arrington Mormon History Lecture Series, in which Arrington himself gave the inaugural lecture in 1995.\n\nPrior to his death, Arrington's long history and family ties influenced his decision to donate his papers to Utah State University. The LDS Church claimed to own materials from Arrington's period as Church Historian. USU was willing to cooperate, allowing the church to search the materials for a short time. Church officials claimed that they had documentation proving up to 60% of the ownership rights regarding Arrington's collection, which is over 700,000 items. The LDS Church revised its list, only asking for less than one-half of one percent of the total collection. By November 2001, there was a lawsuit between the LDS Church and the university and the parties decided to negotiate a settlement.\n\nIn addition to giving the originals of his diaries to USU, Arrington had given microfilm of his diary from his boyhood until 1982 to the Church Archives, but with the condition that his diaries not be read until 25 years after his death. Shortly after Arrington's death, a general authority asked Arrington's daughter, Susan Madsen, to excise 40 parts of her father's diary. By making this request, the LDS Church representatives revealed that they read Arrington's journals without proper permission. George Daines, the Arrington family attorney, explained that the family had grounds to take legal action against the LDS Church and the negotiations were quickly over. Arrington's family agreed to give the LDS Church some of the materials, including minutes to meetings with the Twelve Apostles and materials related to the temple ceremony.\n\nBefore his passing, Arrington's children convinced their father to decrease the amount of time before making his diaries available from 25 years to 10 years. The diaries were made available in September 2010 at Utah State University. Arrington's collection of papers at Utah State's Merrill-Crazier Library adds up to 319 linear feet. It has been regarded as \"one of the most important archival sources on twentieth-century Mormon history.\"\n\nThe following is only a partial list of Arrington's published works. For a complete list, see the \"Bibliography of Leonard Arrington\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The linguistic areas identified so far deserve more research to determine their validity. Knowing about Sprachbunds helps historical linguists differentiate between shared areal traits and true genetic relationship. The pioneering work on American areal linguistics was a dissertation by Joel Sherzer, which was published as Sherzer (1976).\n\nIn \"American Indian Languages: the Historical Linguistics of Native America\", Lyle Campbell also lists over 20 Sprachbunds or linguistic areas, many of which are still hypothetical.\n\n\"Note\": Some linguistic areas may overlap with others.\n\nPache, et al. (2016) note that the word ‘dog’ is shared across various unrelated language families of the Americas, and use this word as a case study of lexical diffusion due to trade and contact.\n\nIn California, identical roots for ‘dog’ are found in:\n\nIn South America, a root for ‘dog’ is shared by Uru-Chipayan (\"paku\" or \"paqu\") and several unrelated neighboring languages of lowland Bolivia (Movima \"pako\", Itonama \"u-paʔu\", and Trinitario \"paku\"), as well as Guaicuruan (Mocoví, Toba, and Pilagá \"pioq\"). An identical root for ‘dog’ is also shared by Huastec (*\"sul\") and Atakapa (\"šul\"), which are very geographically distant from each other although both are located along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Areal words for ‘dog’ are also shared across the U.S. Southeast (Karankawa \"keš\" ~ \"kes\", Chitimacha \"kiš\", Cotoname \"kissa\" ‘fox’, Huavean *\"kisɨ\"), as well as across Mesoamerica. Mesoamerican areal words for ‘dog’ diffused unidirectionally from certain language families to others, and are listed below:\n\nThis linguistic area was proposed by Jeff Leer (1991), and may be a subarea of the Northern Northwest Coast Linguistic Area. This sprachbund is contains languages that have strict head-final (XSOV) syntax.\n\nLeer (1991) considers the strong areal traits to be:\n\nThis linguistic area is characterized by elaborate consonant systems. Phonological areal traits include:\n\n\nTypical shared morphological traits include:\n\nPrimary shared phonological features of this linguistic area include:\n\nOther less salient shared traits are:\n\nFeatures of this linguistic area have been described by Mary Haas.

Shared traits include:\n\nHowever, the validity of this linguistic area is doubtful, as pointed out by Jacobsen (1986), since many traits of the Great Basin area are also common to California languages. It may be an extension of the Northern California linguistic area.\n\nThis linguistic area has been demonstrated in Hinton (1991). Shared traits include:\n\n\nThe Yuman and Cupan languages share the most areal features, such as:\n\nThe influence is strongly unidirectional from Yuman to Cupan, since the features considered divergent within the Takic subgroup. According to Sherzer (1976), many of these traits are also common to Southern California languages.\n\nShaul and Andresen (1989) have proposed a Southwestern Arizona (\"Hohokam\") linguistic area as well, where speakers of Piman languages are hypothesized to have interacted with speakers of Yuman languages as part of the Hohokam archaeological culture. The single trait defining this area is the presence of retroflex stops (/ʈ/ in Yuman, /ɖ/ in Piman).\n\nThe Plains Linguistic Area, according to Sherzer (1973:773), is the \"most recently constituted of the culture areas of North America (late eighteenth and nineteenth century).\" The following areal traits are characteristic of this linguistic area, though they are also common in other parts of North America.\n\n\nFrequent traits, which are not shared by all languages, include:\n\nSouthern Plains areal traits include:\n\nCentral areal traits of the Northeast Linguistic Area include the following (Sherzer 1976).\n\n\nIn New England, areal traits include:\n\nNew England Eastern Algonquian languages and Iroquoian languages share the following traits.\n\n\nThe boundary between the Northeast and Southeast linguistic areas is not clearly determined, since features often extend over to territories belonging to both linguistic areas.\n\nBilabial or labial fricatives (/ɸ/, sometimes /f/) are considered by Sherzer (1976) to be the most characteristic trait of the Southeast Linguistic Area. Various other shared traits have been found by Robert L. Rankin (1986, 1988) and T. Dale Nicklas (1994).\n\nThis linguistic area consists of the following language families and branches.\n\n\nSome languages formerly considered to be part of the Mesoamerican sprachbund, but are now considered to lack main diagnostic traits of Mesoamerican area languages, include Cora, Huichol, Lenca, Jicaquean, and Misumalpan.\n\nThe Mayan Linguistic Area is considered by most scholars to be part of the Mesoamerican area. However, Holt & Bright (1976) distinguish it as a separate area, and include the Mayan, Xincan, Lencan, and Jicaquean families as part of the Mayan Linguistic Area. Shared traits include:\n\n\nThis linguistic area is characterized by SOV word order and postpositions. This stands in contrast to the Mesoamerican Linguistic Area, where languages do not have SOV word order.\n\nHolt & Bright (1976) define a Central American Linguistic Area as having the following areal traits. Note that these stand in direct opposition to the traits defined in their Mayan Linguistic Area.\n\nConstenla's (1991) Colombian–Central American area consists primarily of Chibchan languages, but also include Lencan, Jicaquean, Misumalpan, Chocoan, and Betoi (Constenla 1992:103). This area consists of the following areal traits.\n\nThis linguistic area is characterized by VO word order (instead of SOV), and is described by Constenla (1991). Shared traits are:\n\n\nThe Venezuelan–Antillean could also extend to the western part of the Amazon Culture Area (Amazonia), where there are many Arawakan languages with VO word order (Constenla 1991).\n\nThis linguistic area is characterized by SOV word order and elaborate suffixing.\n\nQuechuan and Aymaran languages both have:\n\nBüttner's (1983:179) includes Quechuan, Aymaran, Callahuaya, and Chipaya.

This area has the following areal traits.\n\n\nQuantitative studies on the Andes and overlapping areas have found the following traits to be characteristic of these areas in a statistically significant way.\n\nA statistical study of argument marking features in languages of South America found that both the Andes and Western South America constitute linguistic areas, with some traits showing a statistically significant relationship to both areas. The unique and shared traits of the two areas are shown in the following table.

A study of argument marking parameters in 74 South American languages by Joshua Birchall found that “not a single feature showed an areal distribution for Amazonia as a macroregion. This suggest that Amazonia is not a good candidate for a linguistic area based on the features examined in this study.” Instead, Birchall finds evidence for three “macroregions” in South America: the Andes, Western South America, and Eastern South America, with some overlap in features between Andes and Western South America.\n\nBased on that study and similar findings, Patience Epps and Lev Michael claim that “an emerging consensus points to Amazonia not forming a linguistic area \"sensu strictu\".”\n\nEpps (2015) shows that Wanderwort are spread across the languages of Amazonia. Morphosyntax is also heavily borrowed across neighboring unrelated Amazonian languages.\n\nThe languages of the South Cone area share the following traits (Klein 1992):\n\n\n\n\n"}

In 1981 he was involved in investigating the wreck of Dutch submarine \"K XVII\".\nHe is especially known for his recovery of large quantities of Chinese porcelain from the VOC ship \"Geldermalsen\" (known as the \"Nanking cargo\") which was sold at auction by Christie's in Amsterdam in 1986.\n\nIn 1999, he discovered the \"Tek Sing\" shipwreck and retrieved 360,000 pieces of porcelain, most of it in impeccable condition, making this the greatest porcelain treasure that has ever been recovered. The cargo originates from the \"Tek Sing\", a junk whose history British shipping researcher Nigel Pickford was able to reconstruct in unprecedented detail. The porcelain was stowed in the tower cargo holds of the ship, where it also served as ballast to stabilize the enormous ship. Most of the porcelain was blue-white porcelain manufactured in the Chinese city of Dehua in the 18th and early 19th century. The greater part of the find is everyday Chinese porcelain utensils intended for export to other countries inside Asia and thus rarely found in the Western hemisphere. As the merchandise had not been made for the European markets, shapes and patterns were not adapted to European taste, but were genuinely Chinese. Other categories of porcelain from different periods were also found, dating back as far the 15th century. The cargo contained a remarkable amount of porcelain of different shapes and sizes, but with identical decoration. It gave buyers in the 21st century the opportunity to compose complete dinner sets with Qing porcelain. Further items such as mercury, sextants, pocket watches, cannons, coins and other merchandise were also salvaged. The recovery was the largest in salvage history. \n\nIt is the story of an incredible shipping disaster with more than 1600 dead (and was consequently entitled the “Titanic of the East” by \"Spiegel\" news magazine), involving opium smuggling, economic difficulties and mass emigration in the early 19th century. The porcelain itself was robust and survived almost 200 years in the sea. Never before have experts been able to examine Chinese export porcelain intended for the South East Asian market on this scale.\nThe catalogue itself broke new ground, becoming a valuable reference work on porcelain in professional circles. It also served as an auction catalogue in conjunction with the auction list featuring all the individual lots.\nHatcher already had two important finds of Chinese porcelain to his name: the Hatcher Collection (from an unidentified Chinese junk) and the Nanking cargo from the Dutch \"Geldermalsen\" that sank in 1752. Both cargoes were successfully auctioned in Europe in the 1980s. Hatcher chose Nagel Auktionen, the leading auction company for Asian art on the European continent, to release the items to the market. \n\nThe importance of the discovery and the auction was emphasized by the commissioning of a special book on the history of the \"Tek Sing\" and its cargo. Harper Collins published a book about Mike Hatcher's life written by Hugh Edward and Nigel Pickford and titled \"Treasures of the Deep\". The book \"The Legacy of the Tek Sing\" contains an account of the story behind the shipwreck, a tale of treachery and heroism, arrogance and greed, all played out against a background of opium smuggling, piracy and mass emigration. It gives details about the salvage as well as the historical background.\n\nA number of controversies surround the salvaging of historic wreck cargo undertaken by Michael Hatcher. The salvaging of both the \"Tek Sing\" and the \"Geldermalsen\" have been heavily criticized by archaeologists for stripping archaeological sites of valuable artefacts without recording any context and destroying the less economically valuable parts of the assemblage, such as the ships themselves.\n\nSeven containers of the \"Tek Sing\" cargo were seized by Australian authorities pursuant to their Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 as the Indonesian government had confirmed that they had been illegally exported from its territory. This confirmation came too late for much of the cargo however, and it was able to continue its journey and be sold at auction in the EU. On 12 September 2001, the 71 939 seized ceramics were returned by Australia to Indonesia.\n\n"}

However, the residents are not concerned about the pollution and ecological devastation caused by them, perhaps due to lack of environmental awareness. Indeed, not even the authorities are concerned by their detrimental effect on the ecology and the environment of the area.\n\nLike most of the villages in Haryana, Milakpur too has made a big contribution towards the Indian Army as soldiers and officers. Though the former outnumber the latter when quantified. Lack of other economic avenues and poor quality education lead to this choice rather than strong feelings of nationalism and patriotism. In addition to a career in the army, other occupations range from brick kiln management, farming, labour, teaching, to Mom and pop shop management. Of these, farming remains the largest and the default source of livelihood.\n\nHansi,a town just six kilometers away, exerts significant urban influence upon the village. Increased educational awareness among the people has resulted in a more proactive stance towards education for their wards. In their quest for quality education, the number of pupils attending English medium schools in surrounding urban areas has increased significantly, despite the expensive fees in comparison to the overlooking free state-run schools where only children of under-privileged families find way. Indeed, the quality of state-run schools is so severely worse than urban schools that children from a poorer socio-economic background, who cannot afford urban schools, are compelled to go to private village schools. The quality of education of these schools is questionable and they have nothing in the name of infrastructure. Sanitation facilities are rare. This clearly indicates the shoddy state of education in the area and brings into light the bogus claims of improving quality of education made by the polity.

Archetypely, they are situated in mountainous areas and the locomotives operating on them (which themselves can also be referred to as \"mocăniță\"s) are steam-powered. These railways were built for cargo and passenger services - some in the era of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, before 1920 - but fell into disrepair over the years. Some are now being rehabilitated for the purposes of tourism.\n\nThe word \"mocăniță\" is a term of endearment, derived from the Romanian word \"mocan\", meaning \"shepherd\" or \"one who lives in the mountains\", and suffixed as feminine and diminutive in keeping with the tradition of naming conveyances and indicating small size. It's also been suggested that it means \"coffee machine\", as one of the little locomotives is reminiscent of one of these in action.\n\nThe most well-known mocăniță runs in the Vaser Valley in Maramureş County. This railway was constructed in the period 1933-1935 and uses a gauge of . It was partially destroyed by German troops during the war, but was rebuilt again. It has primarily been used for logging, and is still used for this purpose, but in 2004 work began on rehabilitating it as a tourist attraction. A Swiss enthusiast who came to Romania in 1987 helped this greatly by starting an organisation for saving the railway: \"Hilfe für die Wassertalbahn in Rumänien\".\n\nSeveral steam engines are used: 764-211 (\"Măriuța\") was built in Berlin by Orenstein & Koppel in 1910; 763-193 (\"Krauss\") was also built in Germany, in 1921; and there are five Romanian locomotives built at Reşiţa between 1953-1955. Diesel engines (built in 1960s-1970s) and other vehicles such as converted minvans also run on the lines. The latter are used by border police, rangers and others for getting quickly up the mountains.\n\nThe tracks run from Vişeu de Sus, from a yard on Strada A. I. Cuza, 1.5 km north from the town centre. The main line is 43 km long, from Vișeu de Sus to Comanu, near the Ukrainian (former Polish) border, though the service may terminate before then at Faina. This trip usually takes between 3 and 4 hours each way.\n\nThere are two other branches: along the Novat Valley (13 km) and towards Stevioara (3 km). The train can occasionally come off the rails, but at a speed of 10 km/hour this poses no danger, and experienced passengers help to get the train back on the rails! The Vaser Valley is an exceptionally scenic location, the habitat of many bears and deer, along with many cattle and sheep. The line is run by a private company, Căile Ferate Forestiere (CFF). As well as regular services, trains can be charted by tourists; special services are also run, for instance on New Year's Eve.

Devolution of this monopoly occurs by the principle of jurisprudence in which they rule according to higher law.\n\nTom W. Bell, former director of telecommunications and technology studies at Cato Institute, now a professor of law at Chapman University School of Law in California wrote \"Polycentric Law\", published by the Institute for Humane Studies, when he was a law student at the University of Chicago. In it he notes that others use phrases such as \"non-monopolistic law\" to describe these polycentric alternatives. He outlines traditional customary law (also known as consuetudinary law) before the creation of states, including as described by Friedrich A. Hayek, Bruce L. Benson, and David D. Friedman. He mentions Anglo-Saxon customary law, church law, guild law, and merchant law as examples of polycentric law. He notes that customary and statutory law have co-existed through history, as when Roman law applied to Romans throughout the Roman Empire, but indigenous legal systems were permitted for non-Romans. In \"Polycentric Law in the New Millennium,\" which won first place in the Mont Pelerin Society's 1998 Friedrich A. Hayek Fellowship competition, Bell predicts three areas where polycentric law might develop: alternative dispute resolution, private communities, and the Internet.\n\nThe University of Helsinki (Finland) funded a \"Polycentric Law\" research project from 1992 to 1995, led by professor Lars D. Eriksson. Its goal was to demonstrate \"the inadequacy of current legal paradigms by mapping the indeterminacies of both the modern law and the modern legal theory. It also addressed the possibility of legal and ethical alternativies to the modern legal theories\" and \"provided openings to polycentric legal theories both by deconstructing the idea of unity in law and re-constructing legal and ethical differences\". The project hosted two international conferences. In 1998 the book \"Polycentricity: The Multiple Scenes of Law\", edited by Ari Hirvonen, collected essays written by scholars involved with the project.\n\nProfessor Randy Barnett, who originally wrote about \"non-monopolistic\" law, later used the phrase \"polycentric legal order\". He explains the advantages of such a system in his book \"The Structure of Liberty: Justice and the Rule of Law.\"\n\nBruce L. Benson also uses the phrase, writing in a Cato Institute publication in 2007: \"A customary system of polycentric law would appear to be much more likely to generate efficient sized jurisdictions for the various communities involved—perhaps many smaller than most nations, with others encompassing many of today’s political jurisdictions (e.g., as international commercial law does today).\"\n\nJohn K. Palchak and Stanley T. Leung in \"No State Required? A Critical Review of the Polycentric Legal Order,\" criticize the concept of polycentric law.\n\nLegal scholar Gary Chartier in \"Anarchy and Legal Order\" elaborates and defends the idea of law without the state. Animated by a vision of peaceful, voluntary cooperation as a social ideal and building on a careful account of non-aggression, the book seeks to explain why the state is illegitimate, dangerous, and unnecessary. It proposes an understanding of how law enforcement in a stateless society could be legitimate and what the optimal substance of law without the state might be, suggests ways in which a stateless legal order could foster the growth of a culture of freedom, and situates the project it elaborates in relation to leftist, anti-capitalist, and socialist traditions.\n\n"}
{"id": "19163052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19163052", "title": "Prehistoric Orkney", "text": "Prehistoric Orkney\n\nPrehistoric Orkney refers to a period in the human occupation of the Orkney archipelago of Scotland that was the latter part of these islands' prehistory. The period of prehistory prior to occupation by the genus \"Homo\" is part of the geology of Scotland. Although some written records refer to Orkney during the Roman invasions of Scotland, prehistory in northern Scotland does not end until the commencement of the Early Historic Period around AD 600.\n\nThere are numerous important prehistoric remains in Orkney, especially from the Neolithic period, four of which form a World Heritage Site. There are diverse reasons for the abundance of the archaeological record. The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites. The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also have helped to preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps inherited from the Norse period of occupation) that may have helped to retain their structural integrity.\n\nPrehistory is conventionally divided into a number of shorter periods but differentiating these various eras of human history is a complex task – their boundaries are uncertain and the changes between them are gradual. The Paleolithic lasted until the retreat of the ice, the Mesolithic until the adoption of farming and the Neolithic until metalworking commenced. A number of the sites span long periods of time and in particular the distinctions between the Neolithic and the later periods are not clear cut. The extraordinary wealth of structures from the Neolithic is not matched either by the early periods, for which the evidence of human occupation is sparse or non-existent, or the later Bronze Age which provides a relative dearth of evidence. The subsequent Iron Age supported a return to monumental building, especially of brochs.\n\nFormal excavations were first recorded in the late 18th century and as they proceeded an understanding of the structures involved progressed from little more than folklore to modern archaeological science. The sites discussed are found on the Orkney Mainland unless otherwise stated.\n\nNo traces have yet been found in Scotland of either a Neanderthal presence or of \"Homo sapiens\" during the Pleistocene interglacials. The first indications of humans occur only after the ice retreated in the 11th millennium BC and the current Flandrian interglacial began. Since that time the landscape of Orkney has been altered by both human and natural forces. Initially, sea levels were lower than at present due to the large volume of ice that remained. This meant that the Orkney islands may have been attached to the mainland, as was the present-day island of Great Britain to Continental Europe. Much of the North Sea basin was also dry land until after 4000 BC. This would have made travel to northern Scotland relatively easy for early human settlers. The subsequent isostatic rise of land makes estimating post-glacial coastlines a complex task.\n\nThe very limited archaeological record provides scant evidence of Mesolithic life in Orkney in particular and Scotland north of Inverness in general. \"Lithic scatter\" sites at Seatter, South Ettit, Wideford Hill, Valdigar and Loch of Stenness have produced small polished stone tools and chippings. A charred hazelnut shell, recovered during the excavations at Longhowe in Tankerness in 2007, has been dated to 6820-6660 BC. However, there is no evidence to suggest whether or not these sites were in year-round occupation and no Mesolithic burial sites have been uncovered anywhere in Scotland to date.\n\nA recently excavated site on Stronsay has produced a thousand pieces of flint and what may be evidence of a temporary camp. With a tentative dating of 7000 BC or older it may prove to be the oldest settlement site found so far on Orkney.\n\nAbout 6000 BC the Storegga Slides of the coast of Norway created a tsunami that reached above normal high tides in places. Evidence of widespread coastal inundations from a wave high has been found as far south as Fife and the impact on shore-dwelling mesolithic societies in Orkney would have been considerable.\n\nThe assemblage of monumental Neolithic structures in Orkney is without parallel in the United Kingdom and on the Orkney Mainland provides an entire landscape of features from this period. During this time, complex new societies came to the fore that were a radical departure from the earlier hunter-gatherers and which were capable of creating substantial structures. The Neolithic in Scotland lasted from approximately 4000 to 2200 BC and Orkney as a whole has nearly 3,000 identified Neolithic sites all told. British archaeologists have often interpreted this era as having two distinct phases; the Earlier Neolithic dominated by regional styles of pottery and architecture followed by a relatively abrupt change into the Later Neolithic characterised by new traditions found throughout the British Isles that incorporate structures on a grander scale. In the Orcadian context, there are definite developments during the Neolithic, but the changes are gradual and tend to build on earlier ideas rather than appearing to form two distinct periods.\n\nThe great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were constructed almost a millennium before the sarsen stones of Stonehenge were erected. At one time it was believed that this flowering of culture was essentially peripheral and that its origins were to be found to the south on mainland Great Britain. However, recently discovered evidence shows that Orkney was the starting place for much of the megalithic culture, including styles of architecture and pottery, that developed much later in the southern British Isles.\n\nKnap of Howar Neolithic farmstead is probably the oldest preserved house in northern Europe. Situated on the island of Papa Westray (which may have been combined with nearby Westray in the early Neolithic), the farmstead consists of two adjacent rounded rectangular thick-walled buildings with low doorways linked by a passageway. This structure was inhabited for 900 years from 3700 BC but was evidently built on the site of an even older settlement. Unstan ware pottery pieces were found on the site, which was only discovered in the 1920s when this part of the coastline was exposed by gales and tides.\n\nThe Barnhouse Settlement is a cluster of at least fifteen buildings, including one that may have been used for communal gatherings, occupied between 3200-2950 BC. The design of the houses, which were built above ground level, includes a central hearth, recessed box beds and stone dressers. There is a network of stone drains leading to a common ditch. Pottery of the grooved ware type, flints and stone tools have been found, as well as three flakes of pitchstone thought to have come from the Isle of Arran.\nSkara Brae consists of ten clustered houses and is northern Europe's most complete Neolithic village. Occupied between 3100–2500 BC the houses are similar to those at Barnhouse, but they are linked by common passages and were built into a large midden containing ash, bones, shells, stone and organic waste. Only the roofs, which were probably supported by timber or whalebone, would have been visible from the outside. In each case the stone dressers were erected so that they dominated the view on entering the house through the low doors and there are elaborate carvings of unknown meaning on some of the stones in the houses and passages. A variety of bone beads, pins and pendants and four carved stone balls were also discovered at the site, which was only revealed after a storm in the winter of 1850 ripped away the grass from a covering sand dune. The existing ruins mostly belong to a secondary phase of building with the foundations of the first phase largely hidden from view.\n\nThere are two main types of chambered cairn on these islands: the Orkney/Cromarty type with a burial chamber approached through a low passage and usually divided into \"stalls\" by upright stone slabs, and the Maeshowe type (see below), which is a later development with a cruciform layout and an elongated passage.\n\nThe island of Rousay has a substantial number of prehistoric sites (see also below), including fifteen of such tombs, resulting it becoming known as the \"Egypt of the north\". Midhowe Chambered Cairn on the western shore of the island is the finest example. The exterior walls of this large stone burial mound survive to well over head-height and the constituent stones are arranged in a herring bone pattern. The original interior chambers were simple in style and dived into two or three stalls, but were later enlarged to include twelve separate compartments set along a passageway. There are other substantial tombs at Blackhammer, Taversoe Tuick, and Yarso. Enlargement and elaboration of burial cairns as the Neolithic progressed is a theme found throughout Scotland, and the move from simple and private tombs to larger structures, some with entrances apparently designed for public gatherings may also be linked to the emergence of landscape-scale ceremonial complexes. Other chambered tombs of significance include those at Unstan and Bookan on the Mainland and Holm of Papa Westray.\n\nLinks of Noltland, a site on the north coast of the island of Westray has been excavated since the 1980s. In 2009 a lozenge-shaped figurine was discovered, which may have been carved 2500-3000 BC and is believed to be the earliest representation of a human face ever found in Scotland. The face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing. Archaeologist Richard Strachan described it as a find of \"astonishing rarity\".\n\nSkara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness together form the Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site in the western part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. It is also clear that whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.\n\nThere is also the possibility that tribal differences were part of the Neolithic cultural landscape. Unstan Ware pottery is associated with small settlements like Knap of Howar, and stalled tombs such as Midhowe. Grooved Ware pottery on the other hand tends to be associated with larger 'village' settlements like Skara Brae and Barnhouse, and with Maes Howe style tombs.\n\nDating from about 3000 BC, Maeshowe is a large chambered cairn and passage grave. \"Howe\" as an element in a name, from the Old Norse word \"haugr\" meaning mound or barrow, is common throughout Orkney. The grass mound hides a complex of passages and chambers built of carefully crafted slabs of sandstone that in scale and accomplishment has few equals in prehistoric Europe. It is aligned so that the rear wall of its central chamber, a rough cube of is illuminated on the winter solstice. It gives its name to the Maeshowe type of chambered cairns, (see above) that include other significant sites such as Cuween Hill, Quanterness and Wideford Hill, and at Quoyness on Sanday.\n\nAfter it fell into disuse during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by Vikings from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD. The Norsemen left a series of runic inscriptions on the stone walls of the chamber, some of which were left by a group of crusaders in the winter of 1153–54. Over thirty individual inscriptions remain, one of the largest such collections in Europe.\n\nThe Ring of Brodgar is a henge and stone circle in diameter, originally made of 60 stones (of which only 27 remain standing) set within a circular ditch up to deep and wide. Some of the remaining stones are high and it has been estimated that the ditch alone took 80,000 man-hours to construct. The ring stands on a small isthmus between the Lochs of Stenness and Harray and it is generally thought to have been erected between 2500 BC and 2000 BC.\nExcavations by Orkney College at the nearby Ness of Brodgar site between the Ring and the Stones of Stenness revealed several buildings, both ritual and domestic and the works suggest there were likely to be more in the vicinity. One structure appears to be long by wide. Pottery, bones, stone tools and polished stone mace heads were discovered. Perhaps the most important find was the remains of a large stone wall which may have been long and or more wide. It appears to traverse the entire peninsula the site is on and may have been a symbolic barrier between the ritual landscape of the Ring and the mundane world around it.\n\nIn 2010 a rock coloured red, orange and yellow was unearthed. Although containers of pigments have been found previously at sites such as Skara Brae, this was the first discovery in Britain, and possibly in Northern Europe, of evidence that Neolithic peoples used paint to decorate their buildings. It is thought that the primitive paint could have been made from iron ore, mixed with animal fat, milk or eggs. Only a week later a stone with a zigzag chevron pattern painted with a red pigment was discovered nearby.\n\nMore recent excavations have revealed a large temple complex on the site without parallel in western Europe, with more than a dozen large temples that were linked to outhouses and kitchens by carefully constructed stone pavements.\nThe site is now considered to be of such significance that Nick Card, director of excavations, was prompted to say in 2012: \"We need to turn the map of Britain upside down when we consider the Neolithic and shrug off our south-centric attitudes...London may be the cultural hub of Britain today, but 5,000 years ago, Orkney was the centre for innovation for the British isles. Ideas spread from this place. The first grooved pottery, which is so distinctive of the era, was made here, for example, and the first henges – stone rings with ditches round them – were erected on Orkney. Then the ideas spread to the rest of the Neolithic Britain. This was the font for new thinking at the time.\"\n\nThe Stones of Stenness are five remaining megaliths of a henge, the largest of which is high. The site is thought to date from 3100 BC, one of the earliest dates for a henge anywhere in Britain. The Stones are part of a landscape that evidently had considerable ritual significance for the \"Grooved ware people\". The Ring of Brodgar lies about to the north-west, and Maeshowe is a similar distance to the east. Barnhouse is only to the north.\n\nThe existing megaliths were originally part of an elliptical shaped stone circle of 12 stones, about in diameter surrounded by a ditch that was wide and deep and with a single entrance causeway on the north side that faces towards the Barnhouse Settlement. The Watch Stone stands outside the circle to the north-west and is high. Other smaller stones include a square stone like a huge hearth setting in the centre of the circle and this along with the bones of cattle, sheep, wolves and dogs found in the ditch suggest ritual sacrifice and feasting.\n\nEven in the 18th century the site was still associated with traditions and rituals, by then relating to Norse gods. The \"Odin Stone\" was pierced with a circular hole, and was used by local couples for plighting engagements by holding hands through the gap. In the early 19th century a local landowner and recent immigrant to Orkney decided to remove the Stones on the grounds that local people were trespassing and disturbing his land in using the stones. He started in December 1814 by smashing the Odin Stone. This caused outrage and he was stopped after destroying one other stone and toppling another. The toppled stone was re-erected in 1906 along with some inaccurate reconstruction inside the circle.\n\nThe Isbister Chambered Cairn, popularly known as the \"Tomb of the Eagles\" is located on the cliffs of South Ronaldsay. This chambered tomb was in use for 800 years or more from 3150 BC, and has five separate stalls and three side-chambers. 16,000 human bones were found during the excavations, as well as 725 bird bones, predominantly white-tailed sea eagle and over of pottery shards.\n\nThe Dwarfie Stane tomb on the island of Hoy is made from a single huge block of red sandstone with a hollowed-out central chamber. This style is quite unlike any other Neolithic Orkney site and probably dates from about 2500 BC. It was the first Orcadian ancient monument to be described in writing, appearing in the 16th century \"Descriptio Insularum Orchadiarum\" by Joannem Ben who provided the explanation for its existence as having been built and used by giants.\n\nThe Bronze Age in Scotland lasted from approximately 2200 BC to 800 BC and northern Scotland has produced a relative dearth of remains from this period in comparison to the Neolithic and later Iron Age. This may in part be due to deteriorating weather conditions in the second millennium BC. In Orkney, fewer large stone structures were built during this period, burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new Beaker culture began to dominate. Nonetheless the great ceremonial circles continued in use as bronze metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period. There is agreement amongst historians that from about 1000 BC it is legitimate to talk of a Celtic culture in Scotland, although the nature of the Orcadian Celtic civilisation and their relationships to their neighbours remains largely unknown.\n\nIn addition to various Mainland sites such as Knowes of Trotty, Kirbuster Hill and the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar there are various Bronze Age structures on other islands such as Tofts Ness on Sanday, Warness on Eday, the remains of two houses on Holm of Faray, and a burnt mound and farmstead on Auskerry.\n\nThe Iron Age provides numerous substantial building remains. In the 1970s excavations at Quanterness, near the site of the Neolithic chambered tomb, revealed an Atlantic roundhouse. This was built about 700 BC using stone stripped from the older building that had fallen into disuse some two millennia previously. Numerous similar finds have been made at for example, Bu on the Mainland and Pierowall Quarry on Westray. These are also many impressive broch sites. These are substantial stone towers that developed out of the roundhouse tradition in north and west Scotland, whose dry-stone walls may have reached in height. Although Orkney has no broch towers where the surviving walls are more than a few metres high, several important sites have been excavated which have numerous associated buildings forming a \"broch village\".\n\nMidhowe Broch lies close to the chambered cairn of the same name on Rousay. There appear to have been at least two separate periods of occupation and at some point buttresses were added to the exterior of the wall, suggesting the structure was in need of support. It is one of 11 broch sites on either side of the Eynhallow Sound. Burroughston Broch on the island of Shapinsay was built in the second half of the first millennium BC and excavated in the mid 19th century. Its earth cladding is intact, allowing visitors to peer down into the broch from above. The walls are up to thick in places and there is a complete chamber off the entrance passage. The remains of stone furniture are evident in the interior.\n\nMine Howe, located near Tankerness in the parish of St Andrews, is a prehistoric subterranean man-made chamber dug deep inside a large mound. Its purpose is not obvious. The walls are lined with stones fitted to form an arch over the cavity and steep steps lead to a rock floor. The entrance is at the top of the small hill and there is a surrounding ditch and evidence of sophisticated metal working around the site. The Rennibister Earth House is a souterrain consisting of an oval chamber with a corbelled roof supported by pillars. Although these structures are usually associated with the storage of food this site is reminiscent of the Neolithic chambered tombs and excavations revealed 18 human skeletons.\n\nWheelhouses are stone buildings from the later Iron Age whose characteristic features include an outer wall within which a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel) form the basis for lintel arches supporting corbelled roofing with a hearth at the hub. Eight presumed sites have been identified in Orkney although the style is different from those of Shetland and the Western Isles. The Orkney sites are four on Sanday, one on Calf of Eday, one at Hillock of Burroughston on Shapinsay and two on the Mainland at Burrian Broch and Broch of Gurness.\n\nFor a brief period Orkney emerged from prehistory and into protohistory. The Greek explorer Pytheas visited Britain sometime between 322 and 285 BC and may have circumnavigated the mainland. In his \"On the Ocean\" he refers to the most northerly point as \"Orcas\", conceivably a reference to Orkney.\n\nRemarkably, the earliest written record of a formal connection between Rome and Scotland is the attendance of the \"King of Orkney\" who was one of eleven British kings who submitted to the Emperor Claudius at Colchester in AD 43 following the invasion of southern Britain three months earlier. The long distances and short period of time involved strongly suggest a prior connection between Rome and Orkney, although no evidence of this has been found and the contrast with later Caledonian resistance to Rome is striking. Pomponius Mela, the Roman geographer, recorded in his \"De Chorographia\", written c. 43 AD, that there were thirty Orkney islands. There is certainly evidence of an Orcadian connection with Rome prior to AD 60 from pottery found at the Broch of Gurness and 1st and 2nd century Roman coins have been found at Lingro broch.\n\nThe Roman presence in Scotland was however little more than a series of relatively brief interludes of partial military occupation. As Roman influence waned in Scotland from 211 onwards, Orkney faded from history again and the Celtic Iron Age way of life continued, largely unchanged.\n\nIn the centuries following Rome's excursions into Scottish territory Orkney was, at least for a time, part of the Pictish kingdom. Very little is known about the Pictish Orcadians, the main archaeological relics being symbol stones. One of the best examples is located on the Brough of Birsay; it shows 3 warriors with spears and sword scabbards combined with traditional Pictish symbols. This small tidal island has a long history of settlement that continued into the Norse period.\n\nAdomnan, the biographer of St Columba, states that there were Orcadians at the court of the Pictish High King, Bridei, in AD 565. These Orcadians were described as \"hostages\" which could imply difficult relations between Orkney and the king, although they may have simply been guests at the court. A Pictish cemetery was found in the grounds of Skaill House (adjacent to Skara Brae) in 1996.\n\nChristianity probably arrived in Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority emerged in the 8th century. The Buckquoy spindle-whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Ogham–inscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now generally considered to be of both Irish and Christian origin. Evidence associated with the St Boniface Church on Papa Westray suggests this island had been the seat of the Christian bishopric of Orkney in Pictish times. The 8th century was also the time the Viking invasions of the Scottish seaboard commenced and with them came the arrival of a new culture and language for the Orkney islands. The Norse era has provided a variety of written records, the substantial Orkneyinga Saga amongst them and at this point the archipelago fully emerges into the historic era.\n\nFormal excavations are first recorded at Earl's Knoll on Papa Stronsay in the Statistical Account of Scotland in 1795. As with the Dwarfie Stane, the mound was assumed to be a giant's grave at the time. Following soon after this, work on the \"Picts-house\" (i.e. chambered tomb) at Quanterness commenced, but little else of note was achieved until the mid 19th century. F. W. L. Thomas, whose day job was as a Captain in the Royal Navy published \"The Celtic Antiquities of Orkney\" in 1852, which listed various sites and aimed to interest \"antiquarians\" in the subject. His hopes were met and about a dozen chambered tombs were worked on between 1849 and 1867 by James Farrer, R.J. Hebden and George Petrie. However, other than work at Unstan near Stromness there was then a lull for about six decades. Then, from the late 1920s, work recommenced with the assistance of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland and the Ministry of Works. The most eminent archaeologist to work here at this time was Vere Gordon Childe. He was involved in excavations at Skara Brae and Rinyo, but it was only when a shard of pottery was discovered at the latter site that it became understood that these settlements dated to the Neolithic rather than the Iron Age. A further 18 tombs were excavated before 1950, including five on Eday and one on the Calf of Eday and by the 1960s the outlines of a modern understanding of Orcadian prehistory had emerged. The advent of radiocarbon dating enabled even more detailed dates to be established and refuted earlier theories that the chambered tombs of Orkney had developed from similar structures found in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as those built by the Minoans, when it became clear that the former pre-dated the latter by a considerable margin.\n\nOther prehistoric sites in Orkney\nStructures\nPrehistoric Scotland\nPrehistoric British Isles\nPrehistoric Europe\nInternational\n\n\n"}

The graphic focus is on social stratification by social class and economic inequality. The work has been described as \"famous\", \"well-known and widely reproduced\". A number of derivative works exist.\n\nIt was published in the 1911 edition of \"Industrial Worker\" (The International Publishing Co., Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.), a newspaper of the Industrial Workers of the World, and attributed to \"Nedeljkovich, Brashich, & Kuharich\".\n\nThe picture shows a literal \"social pyramid\" or hierarchy, with the wealthy few on the top, and the impoverished masses at the bottom. Crowned with a money bag representing capitalism, the top layer, \"we rule you\", is occupied by the royalty and state leaders. Underneath them are the clergy (\"we fool you\"), followed by the military (\"we shoot at you\"), and the bourgeoisie (\"we eat for you\"). The bottom of the pyramid is held by the workers (\"we work for all... we feed all\").\n\nThe work is based on an anonymous 1900 caricature of the Russian Empire hierarchy by the Union of Russian Socialists. The original picture showed workers supporting the pyramid on their backs, with the stanza: \"The time will come when the people in their fury will straighten their bent backs and bring down the structure with one mighty push of their shoulders.\" Notable differences between the Russian 1900 original and the American 1911 derivative version include the replacement of the Russian Empire's black eagle with a money bag, the Russian tsar and tsarina with a more generic trio of figures (a monarch and state leaders in suits), two of the three Orthodox clergy with a Catholic cardinal and a Protestant minister, and the Russian Empire army with a more generic group of soldiers; the workers are no longer bent and no revolutionary stanza is present. On both pictures, a fallen child or child worker symbolizes the plight of the workers. Another shared element is a red flag raised amongst the workers, symbolizing the emergence of the socialist movement. \n\nThe basic message of the image is the critique of the capitalist system, with its hierarchy of power and wealth. It also illustrates that the working class is supporting all others, and if it would withdraw their support from the system it could, literally, topple the existing social order.

He is the son of real estate investor Seymour Durst and his wife Bernice Herstein. His siblings are Douglas, Tommy, and Wendy. Durst's paternal grandfather, Joseph Durst, a penniless Jewish tailor when he emigrated from Austria-Hungary in 1902, eventually became a very successful real estate manager and developer, founding the Durst Organization in 1927. Seymour Durst became head of the family business in 1974 upon his father's death.\n\nWhen Robert was seven, his mother died as a result of a fall from the family's Scarsdale home; he later claimed that, moments before her death, his father walked him to a window from which he could see her standing on the roof. In a March 2015 \"New York Times\" interview, however, his brother Douglas denied this. As children, Robert and Douglas underwent counseling for sibling rivalry; a 1953 psychiatrist's report on 10-year-old Robert mentioned \"personality decomposition and possibly even schizophrenia\".\n\nDurst attended Scarsdale High School, where classmates described him as a loner. He earned a bachelor's degree in Economics in 1965 from Lehigh University, where he was a member of the varsity lacrosse team and the business manager of \"The Brown and White\" student newspaper. He enrolled in a doctoral program at UCLA later that year, where he met Susan Berman, but eventually withdrew from the school and returned to New York in 1969. Durst went on to become a real estate developer in his father's business; however, it was his brother Douglas who was later appointed to run the family business in the 1990s. The appointment caused a rift between Robert and his family, estranging him from them.\n\nPolice have directly questioned Durst, and sometimes conducted searches, in connection to the disappearance of his first wife Kathie McCormack, and two homicides, Susan Berman and Morris Black. In one of those homicides, he was tried and acquitted.\n\nIn the fall of 1971, Durst met Kathleen McCormack, a dental hygienist, whose nickname was \"Kathie\". After two dates, Durst invited McCormack to share his home in Vermont, where he had opened a health food store; she moved there in January 1972. However, Durst's father pressured him to move back to New York City to work in the family real estate business. Durst and McCormack returned to Manhattan, where they married in April 1973.\n\nShortly before her disappearance, McCormack was a student in her fourth and final year at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in The Bronx and was only a few months short of earning her degree. She had intended to become a pediatrician. McCormack was last seen by someone other than Durst the evening of January 31, 1982, at her best friend's dinner party in Newtown, Connecticut. She had arrived unexpectedly and her friend noticed she was upset. She was also wearing red sweatpants, which the friend found odd since McCormack had often dressed in much better quality clothing. She later left for South Salem, New York, after a call from her husband. Although the couple argued and fought, Durst maintained that he put his wife on a train to New York City, had a drink with a neighbor, and spoke to his wife by telephone later that evening. \"That's what I told police,\" Durst later told documentary filmmakers. \"I was hoping that would just make everything go away.\"\n\nAfter McCormack had left her friend's house, she was supposed to meet her friend at a pub called The Lion's Gate in Manhattan. When she failed to show up, her friend became concerned and repeatedly called the police for several days. Days later, Durst filed a missing person report as well. A doorman at one of the two Manhattan apartments where the couple lived claimed to have seen McCormack there on February 1, which was one day after she was last seen, but also claimed that he had seen her only from behind and couldn't be 100% sure that it was her.\n\nMcCormack had been treated at a Bronx hospital for facial bruises three weeks before. She told a friend that Durst beat her, yet she did not press charges over the incident. McCormack asked Durst for a $250,000 divorce settlement. Durst cancelled his wife's credit card, removed her name from a joint bank account, and refused to pay her medical school tuition. At the time his wife disappeared, Durst had been dating Prudence Farrow for three years and was living in a separate apartment. Durst initially offered $100,000 for his wife's return, then reduced the reward to $15,000. Only three weeks after reporting her missing, he was seen discarding his wife's possessions, which he denied. When McCormack's friend and sister had heard she was reported missing, they broke into her cottage hoping to find her. Instead, they found the cottage ransacked and McCormack's mail left unopened. They then became afraid and left.\n\nAfter McCormack went missing, police said that Durst had claimed to have last spoken to her when she called him at their cottage from Manhattan. He claimed that the last time he had seen her was at Katonah train station, where she was planning to board a 21:15 train to Manhattan. He also claimed that on February 4, the supervisor at her medical school called him and said that she had called in sick on February 1 and was absent from class for the entire week. It is uncertain if it was indeed McCormack who made the call. The day after Durst received the call from McCormack's medical school, he reported her as missing. The police found his stories to be full of contradictions.\n\nThe McCormack family now wants Kathleen declared dead as they strongly believe she is deceased. Her mother, Ann McCormack, had before attempted to sue Durst for $100 million. Kathleen's parents are now deceased. Kathleen's younger sister, Mary McCormack Hughes, also believes that Durst killed her. The New York State Police quietly re-opened the criminal investigation into the disappearance in 1999, searching Durst's former South Salem residence for the first time. The investigation became public in November 2000.\n\nOn December 24, 2000, Berman, a longtime friend of Durst who had facilitated his public alibi after McCormack's disappearance and who had recently received $50,000 from Durst, was found murdered execution-style in her home in Benedict Canyon, California. Durst is known to have been in Northern California days before Berman was killed, and to have flown from San Francisco to New York the night before Berman's body was discovered. Although Durst confirmed to the LAPD that he had recently sent Berman $25,000, and faxed investigators a copy of her 1982 deposition regarding his missing wife, he declined to be further questioned about Berman's murder.\n\nDurst said in a 2005 deposition that Berman called him shortly before her death to say that Los Angeles police wanted to talk to her about McCormack's disappearance. A study of case notes by \"The Guardian\" cast doubt on whether the LAPD had made such a call, or whether then-Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro had scheduled an interview with Berman at all. Durst moved to Galveston, Texas, in 2000, lived in a boarding house, and began posing as a woman to avoid police inquiries. Durst had been tipped off to the re-opened investigation into his wife's disappearance on October 31, 2000, and immediately began planning for life as a fugitive. Berman biographer Cathy Scott has asserted that Durst killed Berman because she knew too much about McCormack's disappearance.\n\nOn October 9, 2001, Durst was arrested in Galveston shortly after body parts belonging to his elderly neighbor, Morris Black, were found floating in Galveston Bay. He was released on $300,000 bail the next day. Durst missed a court hearing on October 16 and a warrant was issued for his arrest on a charge of bail jumping. On November 30, he was caught inside a Wegmans supermarket in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, after trying to shoplift a chicken salad sandwich on pumpernickel bread, Band-Aids, and a newspaper, even though he had $500 cash in his pocket. A police search of his rented car yielded $37,000 in cash, two guns, marijuana, Black's driver's license, and directions to the Connecticut home of Gilberte Najamy, a former confidante of McCormack who had dogged Durst for years publicizing accusations he had murdered his wife. Durst also used his time on the run to stalk his brother Douglas, visiting the driveway of his home in Katonah, New York, while armed. Durst employed defense attorney John Waldron while he was held on charges in Pennsylvania. He was eventually extradited to Texas for trial. \n\nIn 2003, Durst was tried for the murder of Black. He employed defense attorney Dick DeGuerin and claimed self-defense; DeGuerin conducted two mock trials in preparation for the case. Durst's defense team had difficulty communicating with him, so they hired psychiatrist Dr. Milton Altschuler to find out why. Altschuler spent over 70 hours examining Durst and diagnosed him with Asperger syndrome, saying, \"His whole life's history is so compatible with a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder.\" Durst's defense team argued at trial that the diagnosis explained his behavior.\n\nDurst claimed he and Black, a cranky and confrontational loner, struggled for control of Durst's .22-caliber target pistol after Black grabbed it from its hiding place and threatened him with it. During the struggle, the pistol discharged, shooting Black in the face. During cross-examination, Durst admitted to using a paring knife, two saws, and an axe to dismember Black's body before bagging and dumping his remains in Galveston Bay. Black's head was never recovered, so prosecutors were unable to present sufficient forensic evidence to dispute Durst's account of the struggle. As a result of lack of forensics, the jury acquitted Durst of murder.\n\nIn 2004, Durst pleaded guilty to two counts of bail jumping and one count of evidence tampering. As part of a plea bargain, he received a sentence of five years and was given credit for time served, requiring him to serve three years in prison. Durst was paroled in 2005. The rules of his release required him to stay near his home; permission was required to travel. That December, Durst made an unauthorized trip to the boarding house where Black had been killed and to a nearby shopping mall. At the mall, he ran into former Galveston trial judge Susan Criss, who had presided over his trial. Due to this incident, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles determined that Durst had violated the terms of his parole and returned him to jail. He was released again from custody on March 1, 2006.\n\nAsked in March 2015 whether she believed Durst murdered Morris Black, Criss commented: \"You could see that this person knew what they were doing and that it was not a first time. The body was cut perfectly like a surgeon who knew how to use this tool on this bone and a certain kind of tool on that muscle. It looked like not a first-time job. That was pretty scary.\"\n\nOn March 16, 2015, DeGuerin advised court authorities in New Orleans that his client waived extradition and would voluntarily return to California. Late that same day, Louisiana State Police filed charges against Durst for being a felon in possession of a firearm and for possession of a firearm with a controlled substance, forestalling his immediate return to California. Orleans Parish District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro commented that, in light of prior convictions that could influence Durst's sentencing, \"[j]ust for those gun charges here in Louisiana, [Durst] could face up to life in prison\".\n\nOn March 23, Durst was denied bail by a Louisiana judge after prosecutors argued he was a flight risk. In an effort to hasten his extradition to California and avoid a protracted Louisiana court battle, DeGuerin raised questions about the validity of the New Orleans arrest and hotel room search, pointing out that a local judge did not issue a warrant until hours after his client was detained. While communicating with the LAPD and conducting an inventory of Durst's hotel room possessions, \"[t]he FBI ... held him there, incommunicado, for almost eight hours\". According to DeGuerin, Durst was questioned extensively by a Los Angeles prosecutor and detective, without a lawyer present, on the morning after his arrest.\n\nIn failing to produce the arresting officers subpoenaed for a probable cause hearing, Durst's attorneys charged that Louisiana prosecutors engaged in a \"misguided attempt to conceal the facts from the court, the defendant, and the public.\" Peter Mansfield, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, said that his office instructed the two FBI agents and arresting officer not to appear, arguing that DeGuerin's subpoenas were issued in an attempt to conduct \"actions against them in their official capacities for the purpose of obtaining testimony, information and material maintained under color of their official duties.\"\n\nOn April 8, a day after the U.S. Attorney filed an independent federal weapons charge, Durst was formally indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for carrying a weapon with a controlled substance and for the illegal possession of a firearm by a felon. Later that month, Durst's lawyers requested that more than $161,000 seized by authorities during their searches be returned, saying the cash \"is not needed as evidence, is not contraband, and is not subject to forfeiture.\"\n\nAfter negotiations with Durst's defense team, Louisiana authorities ultimately dropped weapons charges against Durst on April 23, 2015. Durst's trial on the federal weapons charge was scheduled for September 21, 2015. DeGuerin confirmed rumors that Durst was in poor health, stating that he suffers from hydrocephalus and had a stent put into his skull two years before, as well as spinal surgery and a cancerous mass removed from his esophagus.\n\nDurst's attorneys requested a later date for the federal weapons charge trial, saying they'd need more time to prepare after rulings on pending motions. U.S. District Judge Helen Berrigan later rescheduled the trial to January 11, 2016. On November 16, 2015, a New Orleans federal judge ordered Durst re-arraigned on the weapons charges and scheduled a hearing for December 17. When asked, Durst's attorney said only that Durst did not kill Berman, and that he wants to resolve the other charges to expedite Durst's extradition to Los Angeles to face that charge.\n\nOn December 16, 2015, prosecutors and defense attorneys told Berrigan in a joint motion that scheduling conflicts ruled out all dates before a January 11 trial date. Berrigan ultimately rescheduled the trial for February 3, 2016, and Durst changed his plea to guilty to the federal gun charge and received an 85-month prison sentence.\n\nA few days after a first-degree murder warrant was signed by a Los Angeles judge in relation to the Berman killing, Durst was arrested by FBI agents on March 14, 2015, at the Canal Street Marriott in New Orleans, where he had registered under the false name \"Everette Ward\". Durst, who had been tracked to the hotel after making two calls to check his voicemail, was observed wandering aimlessly in the lobby and mumbling to himself, having driven to New Orleans from Houston four days before.\n\nIn addition to a .38 revolver loaded with four live rounds and one spent shell casing, police recovered five ounces of marijuana, Durst's birth certificate and passport, maps of Louisiana, Florida, and Cuba, a \"flesh-toned\" latex mask, the fake Texas ID used to check into the hotel, a new cellphone, and cash totaling $42,631. Police discovered a UPS tracking number, which led to an additional $117,000 cash in a package sent to Durst by a friend in New York, which was seized after his arrest. Bank statements found in one of Durst's Houston condominiums revealed cash withdrawals of $315,000 in little more than a month.\n\nOn March 15, 2015, New York State Police investigator Joseph Becerra, long involved with the McCormack case, and said to be working closely in recent months with the FBI and Los Angeles detectives, removed some sixty file boxes of Durst's personal papers and effects from the home of Durst's friend Susan T. Giordano in Campbell Hall, New York, where they had been sent by his present wife Debrah Lee Charatan three years prior for safekeeping. Also stored there were videotaped depositions of Durst, Charatan, and Douglas Durst, all related to the Black case.\n\nLos Angeles County Deputy District Attorney John Lewin, in charge of prosecuting Durst, claimed to have found information uncovered by the filmmakers in the HBO documentary series \"The Jinx\" to be compelling and repeatedly flew to New York to interview witnesses, including friends of Durst and Berman. The trial was scheduled to begin in Los Angeles after Durst was arraigned in California, but his transfer was delayed by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons due to \"serious surgery\", according to DeGuerin. Durst pleaded not guilty on November 7, 2016. The trial was postponed to April 16, 2018, to accommodate Durst's defense team, some of whom suffered damage to their homes and offices from Hurricane Harvey. The pretrial hearings included extensive testimony from a number of older witnesses who potentially would not be available when the trial itself begins. In October 2018, Los Angeles Country Superior Judge Mark Windham ruled there is enough evidence to try Durst for the murder of Berman, and Durst will be arraigned November 8, 2018. The following day during his court appearance, Durst pled not guilty.\n\nThe death date for Kathleen Durst has been changed to be most likely at the time she disappeared in 1982 due to murder instead of the previous determination of 1987 for a missing person.\n\nDays after the Berman murder, police were reportedly examining connections between Durst and disappearances of 17-year-old Lynne Schulze from Middlebury, Vermont, and 16-year-old Karen Mitchell from Eureka, California. Investigators are also looking into a possible connection with the disappearance of 18-year-old Kristen Modafferi, last seen in San Francisco in 1997.\n\nSchulze, a Middlebury College freshman, visited Durst's health food store on December 10, 1971, the day she disappeared, and was last seen that afternoon near a bus stop across from the store. DeGuerin characterized the Schulze investigation as \"opportunistic\" and said he would not permit his client to be questioned by Vermont police. Author and investigative journalist Matt Birkbeck reported in 2003, and again in his 2015 book \"A Deadly Secret\", that credit card records placed Durst in Eureka on November 25, 1997, the day Mitchell vanished. Mitchell may have volunteered in a homeless shelter that Durst frequented; Durst, dressed in women's clothing, had visited the Eureka shoe store owned by Mitchell's aunt. Mitchell was last seen walking to work from her aunt's store and possibly speaking to someone in a stopped car; a witness sketch of Mitchell's presumed abductor resembles Durst.\n\nAlthough the FBI ultimately could not connect Durst to the Long Island serial murders (in which some victims were disposed similarly to the Black killing), the Bureau created an informal task force in 2012 to work with investigative agencies in jurisdictions where Durst was known to have lived in past decades, including Vermont, New York, and California. In the wake of his recent arrest, the FBI encouraged such localities to re-examine cold cases. Texas private investigator Bobbi Bacha has also traced Durst operating under stolen identities in Texas, Florida, Massachusetts, New Jersey, South Carolina, Mississippi, and Virginia.\n\nIn early 2015, a six-part HBO documentary titled \"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\" described circumstantial evidence linking Durst to the murder of Berman, who was believed to have knowledge of McCormack's disappearance. The documentary detailed the disappearance of McCormack, Berman's subsequent death, and the killing of Black. Against the advice of his lawyers and his wife Debrah Lee Charatan, Durst gave multiple interviews and unrestricted access to his personal records to the filmmakers. The FBI arrested Durst in New Orleans on the same day as the final episode was broadcast. The documentary ended with him moving into a bathroom where his microphone recorded him saying to himself: \"There it is. You're caught! What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\"\n\nThe Associated Press reported that a March 1999 letter from Durst to Berman, discovered by her stepson and turned over to the filmmakers during their research, provided \"key new evidence\" leading to the filing of murder charges.\n\nOn April 12, 1973 – Durst's 30th birthday – he married Kathleen McCormack. Durst divorced her in 1990, eight years after her disappearance, claiming spousal abandonment. On December 11, 2000, shortly before the Berman killing, Durst married Debrah Lee Charatan. According to \"The New York Times\", the couple briefly shared a Fifth Avenue apartment in 1990 but \"have never lived together as husband and wife\". Durst once told his sister that it was \"a marriage of convenience\"; \"I wanted Debbie to be able to receive my inheritance, and I intended to kill myself,\" Durst said in a 2005 deposition. Charatan currently lives with one of Durst's lawyers, Steven I. Holm.\n\nDurst traveled and lived under dozens of aliases over the years, using different identities to buy cars, rent apartments, and open credit card accounts. \"He had a scanner, copier, and a laminating machine,\" a former office employee of Durst told \"Newsweek\". \"What I didn't realize is that I unwittingly saw what would have allowed Robert Durst to make a fake driver's license.\" Durst was also \"a prolific user of private mailboxes,\" and apparently conducted business under a number of canine-themed names: Woofing LLC, WoofWoof LLC, and Igor-Fayette Inc.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Durst owned a series of seven Alaskan Malamutes each named Igor, which according to his brother Douglas all died under mysterious circumstances. In December 2014, prior to the airing of \"The Jinx\", Douglas told \"The New York Times\" that, \"In retrospect, I now believe he was practicing killing and disposing [of] his wife with those dogs.\" Durst was once recorded saying he wanted to \"Igor\" Douglas. Durst, however, has disputed the notion that he owned seven dogs named Igor; he owned three, he said, one that was run over and another that died in surgery after eating an apple core, \"before the Igor that lasted forever.\"\n\nIn late 1981, while Durst was still married to McCormack, he was nearing the end of a three-year affair with Prudence Farrow, who was also married at the time. A few months before McCormack's disappearance in January 1982, Farrow called her and asked that she give him up, as friends said she wanted him all to herself. After Durst's acquittal of murdering Black in 2003, Farrow contacted law enforcement authorities with concerns for her safety, as she said Durst was angry with her for terminating their relationship three days before McCormack disappeared.\n\nIn mid 2002, Durst signed over a power of attorney to his wife Charatan, a real estate investor, and it is believed their holdings remain closely intermingled. In 2006, Durst gave Charatan around $20 million of his $65 million trust settlement.\n\nIn 2011, Durst purchased a $1.75 million townhouse on Lenox Avenue in Harlem. A source close to his estranged family confirmed that he was living there at least some of the time, and they were keeping him under surveillance. Durst also owns three condominiums in a multi-story complex in Houston, and after filing suit, received a $200,000 settlement in 2006 from a Houston developer who refused to let him move into a unit newly purchased by his wife, which she had then immediately resold to Durst for $10. At the time of Berman's murder in Los Angeles, Durst had just sold a home in Trinidad, California, but maintained an office in Eureka while renting in nearby Big Lagoon.\n\nMedia have variously reported Durst's financial status as \"real estate baron\", \"rich scion\", \"millionaire\", \"multimillionaire\", and \"billionaire\". The Durst family's real estate holdings are worth more than $4 billion, but his brother Douglas was in control of the company beginning in 1994, shortly before their father's death. From about 1994 to 2006, Robert waged a legal campaign to gain greater control of the family trust and fortune. During that time he received $2 million a year from the trust. In 2006 the case was settled, with Durst giving up any interest in his family's properties and trusts in exchange for a one-time payment of about $65 million. It is unknown how much of that went to legal fees and taxes. Durst was still active in real estate; he reportedly sold two properties in 2014 for $21.15 million after purchasing them in 2011 for $8.65 million. At the time of his 2015 arrest, the FBI estimated Durst's net worth at approximately $100 million; \"The New York Times\" estimated his net worth at $110 million.\n\nOn May 1, 2015, the \"New York Post\" reported that Douglas had settled litigation against \"Jinx\" filmmaker Andrew Jarecki, having confirmed that Robert was the source of videotaped depositions that appeared in the documentary. Robert's disclosure apparently violated the terms of his 2006 agreement with the Durst family, which had dispersed to him a lump sum of family trust assets. Although it was unclear whether Jarecki confirmed Robert as his source—\"The New York Times\" reported in March 2015 that Jarecki was given \"unrestricted access\" to Robert's personal records, including the videotaped material—the settlement paves the way for Douglas to reclaim as much as $74 million of his brother's assets, effectively freezing those assets pending court judgment. This could affect Robert's ability to pay for high-caliber legal representation without tapping into real estate or other investments. The \"Post\" reported that Douglas was \"mulling his next move\".\n\nIn November 2015, nearly 34 years after her disappearance, McCormack's three sisters and 101-year-old mother sued Durst for $100 million, citing his apparent role in her murder and his denial to her family of the \"right to sepulcher\", a New York law that grants immediate relatives access to a deceased person's body and the opportunity to determine appropriate burial. If successful, the lawsuit could deprive Durst of most or all of his inherited fortune. McCormack's brother James had attempted in October 2015 to file a wrongful death suit against Durst on behalf of his mother, but was challenged by one of his sisters, who holds her mother's power of attorney. DeGuerin commented that \"there is no evidence that Robert Durst had anything to do with Kathleen's disappearance. Anybody can file a lawsuit, but eventually they'll have to come with evidence.\" On December 7, 2015, the same family members filed a suit asking the court to freeze Durst's assets. The family's attorney, Robert Abrams, called Durst the \"poster child\" for why courts block defendants from disposing assets while civil lawsuits are pending. In July 2016, the McCormack family asked the Surrogate’s Court in Manhattan to \"declare that Kathie died on January 31, 1982, when she was murdered by her husband, Robert Durst\" so the sepulcher lawsuit can proceed.\n\nIn 2012 and 2013, Durst's family members sought and received restraining orders against him, claiming they were afraid of him. Durst was charged with trespassing in New York for walking in front of townhouses owned by his brother Douglas and other family members. He went on trial and was acquitted in December 2014. The judge also vacated the thirteen orders of protection his family members had taken out on him.\n\nIn July 2014, Durst was arrested after turning himself in to police following an incident at a Houston CVS drugstore in which he allegedly exposed himself without provocation and urinated on a rack of candy. He then left the store and casually walked down the street. Durst was charged with misdemeanor criminal mischief. In December 2014, he pleaded \"no contest\" and was fined $500. His lawyer described the incident as an \"unfortunate medical mishap\", as Durst had just been released from a hospital where he had undergone two medical procedures. The incident was recorded on videotape.\n\n\n\n"}

Since 2003, a group of people from Sanlúcar have been working on getting this time which was not possible then, and now, with more preparation and support, that will be possible. There are a large number of historical studies which prove that the expedition left and ended in Sanlúcar de Barrameda.

{"id": "1720499", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1720499", "title": "Simon Kenton", "text": "Simon Kenton\n\nSimon Kenton (April 3, 1755 – April 29, 1836) was a United States frontiersman and soldier in West Virginia, Kentucky and Ohio. He was a friend of Daniel Boone, Simon Girty, Spencer Records, Thomas S. Hinde, Thomas Hinde, and Isaac Shelby. He served the United States in the Revolution, the Northwest Indian War and the War of 1812. Surviving the gauntlet and ritual torture, in 1778 he was adopted into the Shawnee people. He married twice and had a total of ten children.\n\nSimon Kenton was born at the headwaters of Mill Run in the Bull Run Mountains on April 3, 1755, in Prince William County, Virginia to Mark Kenton, Sr. (an immigrant from Ireland) and Mary Miller Kenton (whose family was Scots-Welsh in ancestry). In 1771, at the age of 16, thinking he had killed a man in a jealous rage (the fight began over the love of a girl), Kenton fled into the wilderness of West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio, where for years he went by the name \"Simon Butler.\" After learning that his victim had lived, Kenton took back his original surname.\n\nIn 1774, in a conflict later labeled Dunmore's War, Kenton served as a scout for the European settlers against the Shawnee Indians in what is now West Virginia and Kentucky. In 1777, he saved the life of his friend and fellow frontiersman, Daniel Boone, at Boonesborough, Kentucky.\n\nThe following year, Kenton was rescued from the Shawnee in Ohio by Simon Girty. He had survived many days of running the gauntlet and various other ritual tortures that usually caused death. He was later taken about 50 miles for more torture at Sandusky. There he was saved by Pierre Drouillard, an interpreter for the British Indian department and father of explorer George Drouillard. The Shawnee respected Kenton for his endurance; they named him \"Cut-ta-ho-tha\" (the condemned man). He was \"adopted into the tribe by a motherly squaw whose own son had been slain.\"\n\nKenton served as scout on the 1778 George Rogers Clark expedition to capture Fort Sackville during the American Revolution. Independence did not mean an end to warfare; in 1793-94 Kenton fought in the Northwest Indian War with \"Mad\" Anthony Wayne.\n\nKenton started exploring the area of the Mad River Valley of Ohio and making claims as early as 1788. Kenton first saw the area a decade before while he was held as a prisoner with the Shawnee and vowed that if he survived he would return. In April 1799, Kenton and his associate, Colonel William Ward, led a group of families from Mason County, Kentucky to an area between present-day Springfield and Urbana, Ohio.\n\nIn 1810 Kenton moved to Urbana, Ohio, where he achieved the rank of brigadier general of the state militia. He served in the War of 1812 as both a scout and as leader of a militia group in the Battle of the Thames in 1813. This was the battle in which the Indian chief Tecumseh was killed. Kenton was chosen to identify Tecumseh's body but, recognizing both Tecumseh and another fallen warrior named Roundhead, and seeing soldiers gleefully eager to carve up Tecumseh's body into souvenirs, he identified Roundhead as the chief.\n\nA large boulder located on the west side of the Ritter Public Library in Vermilion, Ohio, discovered in 1937 on a farm a few miles to the south, is inscribed \"1784 S. KENTON,\" and tradition has it that it was carved by Kenton himself while in Indian custody. Documentary evidence, however, shows that Kenton was not in Indian custody in 1784, was not near Vermilion in 1784 and did not learn to write until 1785.\n\nKenton married Martha Dowden and they had four children together. After she died in a house fire, the widower married Elizabeth Jarboe as his second wife. He had six children with her.\n\nKenton died in (and was initially buried at) New Jerusalem in Logan County, Ohio. His body was later moved to Urbana.\n\nLater his widow Elizabeth Jarboe Kenton and a number of their children moved to northwestern Indiana, to an area straddling Jasper, White, and Pulaski counties. It was heavily settled by families who migrated from Champaign County, Ohio, where Kenton is buried.\n\nKenton, Tennessee - named after Simon Kenton, a frontiersman, Indian fighter, surveyor, and an intimate friend of Daniel Boone - is a bedroom community of 1,308 located at the heart of the quad-county area, approximately 15 minutes from four county seats, on Highway 45 West and Highway 89. Kenton is in two counties (Obion & Gibson Counties) and is located 45 miles north of Jackson, Tennessee, 75 miles southwest of Kentucky Lake, 35 miles southeast of Reelfoot Lake and 5 miles from the Obion River bottom and Half Moon Lake.\nSimon Kenton is the namesake of Kenton, the county seat of northwestern Ohio's Hardin County.\n\nKenton County, Kentucky is named for him, as is Simon Kenton High School in Independence, the county seat. A statue honoring him was erected in Covington, Kentucky's Riverside Drive Historic District, overlooking the Ohio River.\n\nSimon Kenton Elementary Schools were named in Xenia and Springfield, Ohio.\n\nSimon Kenton Post #20 in Elsmere, Kentucky of the Kentucky Department of the American Legion is named in his honor.\n\nSimon Kenton Road is a residential street at the base of Bull Run Mountain in Prince William County, Virginia.\n\nThe Boy Scouts of America have the Simon Kenton Council, a division covering Central Ohio to northern Kentucky.\n\nIn the Frontiersman Camping Fellowship of the Royal Rangers, Indiana is designated the Simon Kenton Chapter.\n\nThe Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge is a suspension bridge built in 1931 that crosses the Ohio River and connects Maysville, Kentucky and Aberdeen, Ohio.\n\nOhio's Simon Kenton Trail is a 32-mile multi-use path that stretches from Springfield to Bellefontaine.\n\nThe Simon Kenton Pub is a small bar located in the Water Wheel Restaurant at The Inn at Gristmill Square in Warm Springs, Virginia. The Simon Kenton Inn is an 1828 Historic House with five guest rooms and The Pub restaurant, located near Springfield, Ohio, on land deeded to Simon Kenton by the U.S. Government circa 1800.\n\n"}

{"id": "2513627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2513627", "title": "The Neanderthal Parallax", "text": "The Neanderthal Parallax\n\nThe Neanderthal Parallax is a trilogy of novels written by Robert J. Sawyer and published by Tor. It depicts the effects of the opening of a connection between two versions of Earth in different parallel universes: the world familiar to the reader, and another where Neanderthals became the dominant intelligent hominid. The societal, spiritual and technological differences between the two worlds form the focus of the story.\n\nThe trilogy's volumes are \"Hominids\" (published 2002), \"Humans\" (2003), and \"Hybrids\" (2003). \"Hominids\" first appeared as a serial in \"Analog Science Fiction\", won the 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and was nominated for the John W. Campbell Award the same year; \"Humans\" was a 2004 Hugo Award finalist. In 2017, the full trilogy was presented the Aurora Award for Best of the Decade.\n\nThe initial contact between the two worlds takes place at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Sudbury, Ontario, which is also the location of a scientific research facility in the Neanderthal world.\n\nAs the books unfold, the term \"human\" is used to refer to both species; both species agree to use the Neanderthal terms—\"gliksin\" for members of \"Homo sapiens\" and \"barast\" for members of \"Homo neanderthalensis\"—to distinguish between them.\n\nBarasts (Neanderthals) are dedicated hunter-gatherers, and have no developed concept of agriculture. Despite this, they are still technologically advanced, possessing quantum computers, helicopters, communications, and biological recording instruments. They live in harmony with their environment, using clean energy, living homes, and keeping a constant population. They measure long periods of time in lunar months, not years. The total barast population is much lower, numbering only 185 million worldwide compared to the gliksins' (humans') 6 billion.\n\nDue to their advanced senses of smell, barasts are very sensitive to pheromones. Accordingly, women and men live in separate communities for 25 out of every 29 days. The four days when they do come together — known as \"two becoming one\" — are the cause of a monthly celebration and holiday. All barast women have synchronized menstrual cycles, and the meeting-times are set so that conception is unlikely — except every 10 years, when another generation is purposely conceived. Generations thus grow in synchronized, ten-year cycles; no barast needs to give his age, as simply stating his generation (if this is not simply inferred from his appearance) will give the needed information.\n\nAll children live with their mothers until they reach the age of ten; boys then go to live with their fathers. Children remain with their appropriate parent until the approximate age of 18. Despite this separation of sexes, the barast find the idea of considering either sex better than the other for any reason to be completely foreign (female barast do not suffer any large-scale physical incapacity due to pregnancy). The separation is a voluntary and cultural thing, and people of both sexes are free to go where the other lives at all times, but find it physically and socially discomfiting to do so when two are not one. However, facilities and living styles are fully and truly 'separate but equal' in barast society, and in the rare event that it is too difficult or resource intensive to do so (for example, large scale scientific facilities), this separation is ignored without incident.\n\nWhile opposite-sex couples form long-term bonds similar to marriage, the same is true of life during the rest of the month. All barasts would consider themselves bisexual by the gliksin definition; they form same-sex bonds while two are not one. Thus each adult who so chooses, no matter their gender, has a \"man-mate\" and a \"woman-mate\"; one for procreation and the genetic family basis, the other for companionship and a family unit base when their opposite-sex partner is not present. The larger, intertwined family networks that result add cohesion to barast society.\n\nThe barast world has a single government hierarchy: each region of the globe is governed by a local \"Gray Council\"; these in turn answer to the \"High Gray Council\", the world government.\n\nAbout eight decades before the time of the novels, \"companion implants\" were perfected and issued to all barasts. These are comprehensive recording and transmission devices, mounted in the forearm of each person. Their entire life is constantly monitored and sent to their \"alibi archive\", a repository of recordings that are only accessible by their owner, or by the proper authorities when investigating an infraction, and in the latter case only in circumstances relevant to the investigation. Recordings are maintained after death; it is not made clear what the reasoning is for this and under what circumstances and or by whom a deceased person's archive can be accessed.\n\nAny serious crime has a single punishment: the castration of the offender and all others who share at least half his genes (parents, siblings, and children). This eugenic practice serves to keep any undesirable elements out of the gene pool without severely punishing an offender, beyond his loss of genetic heritage.\n\nAs a result, serious crimes of almost any sort are virtually unknown in the barast world. The exception is sexual crimes committed by a partner. Because the punishment for such crimes, such as spousal abuse, would include the castration of the complainant's own children, these crimes are unreported. While divorce for barast is generally a simple matter of deciding and declaring not to be with another person, those in such relationships find themselves trapped, as freeing their partner to seek a new mate opens the possibility that the new mate will report the violent activity.\n\nBecause barast physical strength is much higher than that of a gliksin, any physical violence between them is almost certain to result in death or serious injury. They thus lack any direct physical confrontation sports and martial arts (the second is lacking additionally because barast do not believe in conflict; they have had only one war in their recent history, with the loss of 83 people being considered a horrendous tragedy). Any physical violence, if reported, results in immediate imposition of castration. However, because the punishment is so severe, these incidents are not always reported officially, and if the injured party is willing to forgive, and the aggressor undertakes counseling for anger management, an incident may go unpunished. Such incident is admissible in a future legal hearing as evidence of a prior disposition to violence, however.\n\nLower population levels and the absence of large-scale agriculture mean that many species exist which are extinct on the gliksin version of Earth. These include not only birds such as the passenger pigeon, but also megafauna such as the woolly mammoth. Also, forests are much more extensive because there was no need to cut them down on a large scale. Barasts have domesticated wolves as companions, but have not bred them into the many varieties of the domestic dog. A gliksin may become fearful upon seeing a barast dog, thinking it a wild wolf. A barast, seeing a gliksin's dog such as a dachshund, may wonder if the creature really \"is\" a dog.\n\nIt is heavily implied that the barast did not spread to large areas of their world until after they had achieved a high level of civilization. One scene has a gliksin and a barast ancestor looking across the Mediterranean; the gliksin ancestor eagerly sets off to explore the new, strange place, while the barast ancestor notes its existence and goes home. This is consistent with their hunter-gatherer lifestyle which favors high levels of knowledge concerning the land and low migration, including a general avoidance of danger. Also, it is mentioned that barast are naturally of higher intelligence than gliksin, with average IQ being 10% higher before a several generation eugenic campaign, during which the least intelligent 10% were voluntarily sterilized to increase the species intelligence (no data is given on the post campaign IQ comparison). It is theorized that this difference is an additional reason for the lower occurrence of extinction events: because of their higher intelligence, the barast were able to recognize far earlier in their civilization that over-hunting would deplete a species.\n\nThe climate in the barast world is also somewhat cooler, because of the lack of greenhouse gases compared to the gliksins' Earth. Barasts are not as heat-tolerant as gliksins, probably because they evolved on a cooler Earth and also due to their greater muscle mass. As a result, tropical regions of their Earth are just as underpopulated as the polar regions on the gliksins' Earth. A significant story feature is the state of the Earth's magnetic field. In the barast world a reversal of polarity happened shortly before the story starts and caused no noticeable harm to the barasts. As to why the pole reversals are off by several years, it is ascribed to random small differences over the intervening 40,000 years. In the gliksin world it is happening as the stories take place; this has an effect on the minds of gliksins, whose brain structures are different from the barasts' (see Religion).\n\nWith the use of computer-aided communication devices, readers get to see only a glimpse of barast language. A \"dooslarm basadlarm\" refers to something like a judicial preliminary hearing with a literal translation of \"asking small before asking large.\" The phrase \"Dusble korbul to kalbtadu\" is translated as \"In a quantum-computing facility.\" Barast language is rendered as English when the action takes place in the barast world. One aspect of the language which can be discerned through the use of words like \"gristle!\" and \"marrowless bone\" for curses is that this register of speech is derived directly from real-world items. The customary barast greeting is \"Healthy day.\"\n\nBarast do not have a monetary economy. Each person is given what they need when they need it, and in turn is expected to work at providing a meaningful 'contribution' to society. No barast would ever dream of attempting to take more than they need from society, and because of their stable population, there are no issues with scarcity (the population level was stabilized at the point it was in order to prevent such issues from even developing).\n\nBarast always consider their work in terms of how it contributes to society, and any work which does not contribute sufficiently is stopped. This leads to a lack of knowledge in certain areas, such as astrophysics, as such pursuits are stopped once they ceased to produce meaningful improvements in ordinary life. This also leads to some over-specialization, as driving is considered a specialized contribution and how to do so is known only to public conveyors whose sole contribution is to taxi people from point to point or to drive public buses.\n\nOccasionally, a Barast may voluntarily remove themselves from society in order to continue work that has been deemed not meaningful or to protest when work is purposefully stopped as dangerous. This individual would move away from the community to an isolated area, and would thereafter support themselves. They would not be able to generally ask for assistance from the greater community, and would also in some cases remove their Alibi Archive implant as protest (so their life after leaving the community would not be recorded) or have it removed involuntarily (to prevent any further recording regarding dangerous work). This isolation is voluntary, and they can have visitors or opt to return to the community at any time, although returning requires that they resume providing a meaningful contribution (and cease any dangerous work, if that was the reason for leaving).\n\nBarast medicine has become largely automated, and most doctors, aside from first aid (excepting researchers), simply operate and maintain this technology. This technology is highly robust and is able to be adapted to Gliksin physiology fairly quickly after contact. \n\nA notable difference in medical practice is a result of the lack of squeamishness displayed by the Barast. Rather than using anesthesia for surgery, this technology uses direct neural blocks to cut off signals from any body part being operated on while the operation is performed in full view of the doctor and the patient being operated on. The Barast do not find this disturbing in the least, which one Gliksin theorizes is because, as they are still a civilization completely composed of active hunters, they have been exposed to such scenes since childhood.\n\nThe Barasts have no religion and no concept of religion. This is not due to a simple disbelief or worldwide atheism. The Barasts never had a religion and are not physically capable of believing in a god or gods or having religious experiences due to the structure of their brains. Prior to contact between the gliksins and the Barasts, the Barasts had no concept of a creator; an afterlife or souls never occurred to them. The Barasts do not understand how the gliksins can possibly believe in the stories their religions tell, and are sometimes frustrated with the gliksins' insistence of the truth of their beliefs. Nevertheless, the Barasts do accept religion as a part of who the gliksins are. The Barasts also do not believe that the universe had a beginning and do not adhere to the Big Bang theory. Instead, they believe the universe has always existed, and can point to scientific evidence and verified theory to back up this belief. They believe that the gliksin theories concerning an origin of the universe exist because of the gliksin need to believe in a creator, and thus a beginning, which biases gliksin science. The story ends before any large-scale intermingling and rationalization of the two races' science can begin, so the ultimate outcome of detailed comparison between these viewpoints is unknown.\n\nAt Robert J.

The music was written by Donald Swann, and the words are taken from poems in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth writings, especially \"The Lord of the Rings\".\n\nThe title of this opus is taken from \"The Road Goes Ever On\", the first song in the collection. The songs form a song cycle, designed to fit together when played in sequence.\n\nWith Tolkien's approval, Donald Swann wrote the music for this song cycle, and much of the music resembles English traditional music or folk music. The sole exception is the Quenya song \"Namárië\", which was based on a tune by Tolkien himself and which has some affinities to Gregorian chant.\n\nThis book has been valued even by those uninterested in the music, since it helps Tolkien's readers to better understand the cultures of the various mythological beings presented in Middle-earth, and helps linguists analyse Tolkien's poetry. For example, it contains one of the longest samples of the language Quenya (in the song \"Namárië\"), as well as the Sindarin prayer \"A Elbereth Gilthoniel\" with grammatical explanations.\n\nAlso, in addition to the sheet music, the book includes an introduction that contains additional information about Middle-earth. Prior to the publication of \"The Silmarillion\", this introduction was the only publicly available source for certain information about the First Age of Middle-earth.\n\nThe first edition of \"The Road Goes Ever On: a Song Cycle\" was published on 31 October 1967, in the United States.\n\nAn LP record of this song cycle was recorded on 12 June 1967, with Donald Swann on piano and William Elvin singing. Side one of this record consisted of Tolkien himself reading five poems from \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\". The first track on side two was Tolkien reading the Elvish prayer \"A Elbereth Gilthoniel\". The remainder of side two contained the song cycle performed by Swann and Elvin. This LP record, entitled Poems and Songs of Middle Earth and released by Caedmon Records (TC 1231), is long out of print and very difficult to find.\n\nThe second edition of \"The Road Goes Ever On\", published in 1978, added music for \"Bilbo's Last Song.\" This song was also published separately.\n\nThe third edition, published in 1993, added music for \"Lúthien Tinúviel\" from \"The Silmarillion\", which had earlier appeared in \"The Songs of Donald Swann: Volume I\". The third edition of \"The Road Goes Ever On\" was packaged with a CD that duplicated the song cycle (but not Tolkien's readings) from the 1967 LP record. The CD also included two new recordings. The third edition was reprinted in hardcover in 2002 by Harper Collins (); this had the same text and CD as the 1993 edition.\n\nOn 10 June 1995, the song cycle was performed in Rotterdam under the auspices of the Dutch Tolkien Society, by the baritone Jan Krediet together with the chamber choir EnSuite and Alexandra Swemer on the piano. A CD of this concert was published in a limited edition.\n\nThe complete list of songs in this song-cycle is as follows:\n\n\nThe following additional songs were added after the first edition, but do not form part of the song cycle itself:\n\n\n"}

It is particularly used to denigrate white people living in such circumstances and can be considered to fall within the category of racial/ethnic slurs.\n\nIn the mid-20th century, poor whites who could not afford to buy suburban-style tract housing began to purchase mobile homes, which were not only cheaper, but which could be easily relocated if work in one location ran out. These – sometimes by choice and sometimes through local zoning laws – gathered in trailer camps, and the people who lived in them became known as \"trailer trash\". Despite many of them having jobs, albeit sometimes itinerant ones, the character flaws that had been perceived in poor white trash in the past were transferred to trailer trash, and trailer camps or parks were seen as being inhabited by retired persons, migrant workers, and, generally, the poor. By 1968, a survey found that only 13% of those who owned and lived in mobile homes had white collar jobs.\n\nTrailers got their start in the 1930s, and their use proliferated during the housing shortage of World War II, when the Federal government used as many as 30,000 of them to house defense workers, soldiers and sailors throughout the country, but especially around areas with a large military or defense presence, such as Mobile, Alabama and Pascagoula, Mississippi. In her book \"Journey Through Chaos\", reporter Agnes Meyer of \"The Washington Post\" travelled throughout the country, reporting on the condition of the \"neglected rural areas\", and described the people who lived in the trailers, tents and shacks in such areas as malnourished, unable to read or write, and generally ragged. The workers who came to Mobile and Pascagoula to work in the shipyards there were from the backwoods of the South, \"subnormal swamp and mountain folk\" whom the locals described as \"vermin\"; elsewhere, they were called \"squatters\". They were accused of having loose morals, high illegitimacy rates, and of allowing prostitution to thrive in their \"Hillbilly Havens\". The trailers themselves – sometimes purchased second- or third-hand – were often unsightly, unsanitary and dilapidated, causing communities to zone them away from the more desirable areas, which meant away from schools, stores, another necessary facilities, often literally on the other side of the railroad tracks.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus' song \"Burn Down the Trailer Park\" and Toby Keith's song \"Trailerhood\" and contain humorous lyrics about living in a trailer park.\n\nColt Ford's song \"No Trash in My Trailer\" (2009) tells of a redneck-type male who throws his girlfriend out of his mobile home, the message being \"there ain't no trash in my trailer, since the day I threw you outta here.\"\n\nThe song \"Trailer Trash\" appears on Modest Mouse's album \"The Lonesome Crowded West\" (1997).\n\nEminem refers to himself as \"Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God\" in his song \"Rap God\" from the album \"The Marshall Mathers LP 2\" (2013).\n\nLana Del Rey's persona is portrayed as a \"cheap trailer trash and everyone knows it\" in the song \"Boarding School\". Trailer park references also appear on numerous other songs, including \"Hundred Dollar Bill\", \"Yayo\" and \"Trash Magic\".\n\nMost of the residents of the Pimmett Hills Trailer Park on \"My Name Is Earl\" fit this stereotype to some degree or another.\n\nThe Canadian television series \"Trailer Park Boys\", done in mockumentary style, documents the misadventures of the residents of the Sunnyvale Trailer Park.\n\n"}
{"id": "1427608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1427608", "title": "Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian", "text": "Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian\n\nIn the field of Egyptology, transliteration of Ancient Egyptian is the process of converting (or mapping) texts written in the Egyptian language to alphabetic symbols representing uniliteral hieroglyphs or their hieratic and Demotic counterparts. This process facilitates the publication of texts where the inclusion of photographs or drawings of an actual Egyptian document is impractical.\n\nIt should be emphasised that transliteration is not the same as transcription. Transcription seeks to reproduce the \"pronunciation\" of a text. For example, the name of the founder of the Twenty-second Dynasty is transliterated as \"ššnq\" but transcribed \"Shoshenq\" in English, \"Chéchanq\" in French, \"Sjesjonk\" in Dutch, and \"Scheschonk\" (\"Scheschonq\") in German.\n\nBecause exact details regarding the phonetics of Egyptian are not completely known, most transcriptions depend on Coptic for linguistic reconstruction or are theoretical in nature. Egyptologists, therefore, rely on transliteration in scientific publications.\n\nImportant as transliteration is to the field of Egyptology, there is no one standard scheme in use for hieroglyphic and hieratic texts. Some might even argue that there are as many systems of transliteration as there are Egyptologists. However, there are a few closely related systems that can be regarded as conventional. Many non-German-speaking Egyptologists use the system described in Gardiner 1954, whereas many German-speaking scholars tend to opt for that used in the \"Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache\" (Erman and Grapow 1926–1953), the standard dictionary of the ancient Egyptian language. However, there is a growing trend, even among English-speaking scholars, to adopt a modified version of the method used in the \"Wörterbuch\" (e.g., Allen 2000).\n\nAlthough these conventional approaches to transliteration have been followed since most of the second half of the nineteenth century to the present day, there have been some attempts to adopt a modified system that seeks to utilise the International Phonetic Alphabet to a certain degree. The most successful of these is that developed by Wolfgang Schenkel (1990), and it is being used fairly widely in Germany and other German-speaking countries. More recent is a proposal by Thomas Schneider (2003) that is even closer to the IPA, but its usage is not presently common. The major criticism leveled against both of these systems is that they give an impression of being much more scientifically accurate with regard to the pronunciation of Egyptian. Unfortunately this perceived accuracy is debatable. Moreover, the systems reflect only the theoretical pronunciation of Middle Egyptian and not the older and later phases of the language, which are themselves to be transliterated with the same system.\n\nThere are 24 consonantal phonemes distinguished in Egyptian writing, \nfollowing Edel (1955) transliterated and ordered alphabetically in the sequence:\n\"ꜣ j ꜥ w b p f m n r h ḥ ḫ ẖ z s š q k g t ṯ d ḏ\".\nA number of variant conventions are used interchangeably depending on the author:\n\nThe vowel is conventionally inserted between consonants to make Egyptian words pronounceable in English.\n\nThe following text is transliterated below in some of the more common schemes.\n\nM23-X1:R4-X8-Q2:D4-W17-R14-G4-R8-O29:V30-U23-N26-D58-O49:Z1-F13:N31-Z2ss-V30:N16:N21*Z1-D45:N25\nUnicode: \n\nErman and Grapow 1926–1953\n\n\nGardiner 1953\n\nBuurman, Grimal, \"et al.\" 1988\n\nSchenkel 1991\n\nAllen 2000\n\nSchneider 2003\n\nAs the latest stage of pre-Coptic Egyptian, Demotic texts have long been transliterated using the same system(s) used for hieroglyphic and hieratic texts. However, in 1980, Demotists adopted a single, uniform, international standard based on the traditional system used for hieroglyphic, but with the addition of some extra symbols for vowels and other letters that were written in the Demotic script. The \"Demotic Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago\" (or CDD) utilises this method. As this system is likely only of interest to specialists, for details see the references below.\n\nIn 1984 a standard, ASCII-based transliteration system was proposed by an international group of Egyptologists at the first \"Table ronde informatique et égyptologie\" and published in 1988 (see Buurman, Grimal, \"et al.\", 1988). This has come to be known as the \"Manuel de Codage\" (or MdC) system, based on the title of the publication, \"Inventaire des signes hiéroglyphiques en vue de leur saisie informatique: Manuel de codage des textes hiéroglyphiques en vue de leur saisie sur ordinateur\". It is widely used in e-mail discussion lists and internet forums catering to professional Egyptologists and the interested public.\n\nAlthough the \"Manuel de codage\" system allows for simple \"alphabetic\" transliterations, it also specifies a complex method for electronically encoding complete ancient Egyptian texts, indicating features such as the placement, orientation, and even size of individual hieroglyphs. This system is used (though frequently with modifications) by various software packages developed for typesetting hieroglyphic texts (such as SignWriter, WinGlyph, MacScribe, InScribe, Glyphotext, , and others).\n\nWith the introduction of the Latin Extended Additional block to Unicode version 1.1 (1992) and the addition of Egyptological alef and ayin to Unicode version 5.1 (2008), it is possible to fully transliterate Egyptian texts using a Unicode typeface. The following table only lists the special characters used in various transliteration schemes (see below).\n\nThree additional characters are required for transliterating Egyptian:\n\nAlthough six Egyptological and Ugariticist letters were proposed in August 2000, it was not until 2008 (Unicode 5.1) that four of the six letters were encoded:\n\nAnother two proposals were made regarding the Egyptological yod, the eventual result of which was to accept the use of the Cyrillic psili pneumata () as one of several possible diacritics for this purpose. The other options use the superscript comma (U+0313) and the right half ring above (U+0357). An new attempt for a sign called LETTER I WITH SPIRITUS LENIS was made in 2017. Within the Egyptological community objection were raised concerning this name.\n\nThe Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale still recommends its own Unicode-based transliteration system. It uses the Middle English yogh ⟨ȝ⟩ (Unicode U+021D) for alef (hamza), a reverse sicilicus ⟨ʿ⟩ (Unicode U+02BF) for ayin, and ⟨j⟩ or Vietnamese ⟨ỉ⟩ (Unicode U+1EC9, \"i\" with hook above) for Egyptological yod.\n\nMiddle Egyptian is reconstructed as having had 24 consonantal phonemes. There is at least one hieroglyph with a phonetic value corresponding to each of these phonemes.\n\nThe table below gives a list of such \"uniliteral signs\" along with their conventional transcription and their conventional \"Egyptological pronunciation\" and probably phonetic value. \n\nIt is possible that two phonemes /s/ and /z/ in Old Egyptian were merged in the Middle Egyptian stage.\nSimilarly, there are a number of hieroglyphs that may have been biliteral in Old Egyptian which were reduced to \"uniliteral\" phonetic value in Middle Egyptian.\n\nMany hieroglyphs are coloured, though the paint has worn off most stone inscriptions. Colors vary, but many glyphs are predominantly one colour or another, or a particular combination (such as red on the top and blue on the bottom). In some cases, two graphically similar glyphs may be distinguished solely by colour, though in other cases it's not known if the choice of colour had any meaning. The glyphs below are given in their predominant colour, red, yellow, green and blue (with blue including black). Glyphs in black are either polychrome (in the case of <ꜣ>) or are attested in multiple colours (in the case of <ẖ>).\n\nGardiner lists several variations:\n\n\n"}

Alternative terminology sometimes used are: implied rights, natural rights, background rights, and fundamental rights.\n\nUnenumerated rights will be actual rights insofar as they necessitate the systematization of positively enumerated rights anywhere laws would become logically incoherent, or could not be adhered to or maintained in the exclusion of those unenumerated items as rights. Examples of this include federal systems where constituent member constitutions have to be interpreted in relation to their membership in the federal whole, adjudicative of whether authority is rightfully devolved or more rightly federative.\n\nThis term alternatively, is used loosely to mean any perceived rights, often considered peremptory or intuitively fiat (such as rights innate to each individual or inherent to mankind), that are without expression or instance of articulation.\n\nImplied rights are the political and civil freedoms that necessarily underlie the actual words of the constitution but are not themselves expressly stated directly in the constitution. Since the 1990s the High Court has discovered rights which are said to be implied by the very structure and textual form of the Constitution. Chief amongst these is an implied right to freedom of communication on political matters, which was first recognised in \"Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills\". In addition, some protections of civil liberties have been the result of the High Court's zealous attempts to safeguard the independence of, and confidence in, the Federal judiciary. A good example of this can be seen in \"Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)\", in which the High Court struck down a criminal law passed by the New South Wales Parliament that was directed at a single named individual in a similar manner to a Bill of attainder. The High Court also inferred a limited right to vote from the text of the Constitution in \"Roach v Electoral Commissioner\", invalidating legislation that prevented all prisoners from voting.\n\nArticle 40.3 of the Irish constitution refers to and accounts for the recognition of unenumerated rights. The Supreme Court is often the main source of such rights, such as the right to bodily integrity, the right to marry and the right to earn a living, among others.\n\nArticle 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of China guarantees unenumerated freedoms and rights of the people that are not detrimental to social order or public welfare, now in effect in Taiwan.\n\nIn the United States, the Ninth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects against federal infringement of unenumerated rights. The text reads:The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. The Supreme Court of the United States has also interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to protect against state infringement of certain unenumerated rights including, among others, the right to send one's children to private school and the right to marital privacy.\n\nThe Supreme Court has found that unenumerated rights include such important rights as the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to keep personal matters private and to make important decisions about one’s health care or body.\n\n"}
