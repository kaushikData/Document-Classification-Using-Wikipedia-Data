{"id": "693370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=693370", "title": "A Cyborg Manifesto", "text": "A Cyborg Manifesto\n\n\"A Cyborg Manifesto\" is an essay written by Donna Haraway and published in 1985. In it, the concept of the cyborg is a rejection of rigid boundaries, notably those separating \"human\" from \"animal\" and \"human\" from \"machine.\" She writes: \"The cyborg does not dream of community on the model of the organic family, this time without the oedipal project. The cyborg would not recognize the Garden of Eden; it is not made of mud and cannot dream of returning to dust.\"\n\nThe \"Manifesto\" criticizes traditional notions of feminism, particularly feminist focuses on identity politics, and encouraging instead coalition through affinity. She uses the metaphor of a cyborg to urge feminists to move beyond the limitations of traditional gender, feminism, and politics; consequently, the \"Manifesto\" is considered one of the milestones in the development of feminist posthumanist theory.\n\nHaraway begins the \"Manifesto\" by explaining three boundary breakdowns since the 20th Century that have allowed for her hybrid, cyborg myth: the breakdown of boundaries between human and animal, animal-human and machine, and physical and non-physical. Evolution has blurred the lines between human and animal; 20th Century machines have made ambiguous the lines between natural and artificial; and microelectronics and the political invisibility of cyborgs have confused the lines of physicality.\n\nHaraway highlights the problematic use and justification of Western traditions like patriarchy, colonialism, essentialism, and naturalism (among others). These traditions in turn allow for the problematic formations of taxonomies (and identifications of the Other) and what Haraway explains as \"antagonistic dualisms\" that order Western discourse. These dualisms, Haraway states, \"have all been systematic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals... all [those] constituted as others.\" She highlights specific problematic dualisms of self/other, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man (among others). She explains that these dualisms are in competition with one another, creating paradoxical relations of domination (especially between the One and the Other). However, high-tech culture provides a challenge to these antagonistic dualisms.\n\nHaraway's cyborg theory rejects the notions of essentialism, proposing instead a chimeric, monstrous world of fusions between animal and machine. Cyborg theory relies on writing as \"the technology of cyborgs,\" and asserts that \"cyborg politics is the struggle for language and the struggle against perfect communication, against the one code that translates all meaning perfectly, the central dogma of phallogocentrism.\" Instead, Haraway’s cyborg calls for a non-essentialized, material-semiotic metaphor capable of uniting diffuse political coalitions along the lines of affinity rather than identity. Following Lacanian feminists such as Luce Irigaray, Haraway’s work addresses the chasm between feminist discourses and the dominant language of Western patriarchy. As Haraway explains, “grammar is politics by other means,” and effective politics require speaking in the language of domination.\n\nAs she details in a chart of the paradigmatic shifts from modern to postmodern epistemology within the Manifesto, the unified human subject of identity has shifted to the hybridized posthuman of technoscience, from “representation” to “simulation,” “bourgeois novel” to “science fiction,” “reproduction” to “replication,” and “white capitalist patriarchy” to “informatics of domination.” While Haraway’s “ironic dream of a common language” is inspired by Irigaray’s argument for a discourse other than patriarchy, she rejects Irigaray’s essentializing construction of woman-as-not-male to argue for a linguistic community of situated, partial knowledges in which no one is innocent.\n\nHaraway takes issue with some traditional feminists, reflected in statements describing how \"women more than men somehow sustain daily life, and so have a privileged epistemological (relating to the theory of knowledge) position potentially.\" The views of traditional feminism operate under the totalizing assumptions that all men are one way, and women another, whereas \"a cyborg theory of wholes and parts,\" does not desire to explain things in total theory. Haraway suggests that feminists should move beyond naturalism and essentialism, criticizing feminist tactics as \"identity politics\" that victimize those excluded, and she proposes that it is better strategically to confuse identities. \nHer criticism mainly focuses on socialist and radical feminism. The former, she writes, achieves \"to expand the category of labour to what (some) women did\" Socialist feminism does not naturalize but rather builds a unity that was non-existent before -namely the woman worker.\nOn the other hand, radical feminism, according to Catherine MacKinnon, describes a world in which the woman only exists in opposition to the man. The concept of woman is socially constructed within the patriarchal structure of society and woman only exist because men have made them exist. The woman as a self does not exist. \nHaraway criticizes both when writing that \"my complaint about socialist/Marxian standpoints is their unintended erasure of polyvocal, unassimilable, radical difference made visible in anti-colonial discourse and practice\" and \"MacKinnon's intentional erasure of all difference through the device of the 'essential' non-existence of women is not reassuring\" (299). H\n\nHaraway also indirectly critiques white feminism by highlighting the struggles of women of color: she suggests that a woman of color “might be understood as a cyborg identity, a potent subjectivity synthesized from fusions of outsider identities and in the complex political-historical layerings of her ‘biomythography.’\"\n\nTo counteract the essentializing and anachronistic rhetoric of spiritual ecofeminists, who were fighting patriarchy with modernist constructions of female-as-nature and earth mothers, Haraway employs the cyborg to refigure feminism into cybernetic code.\n\nHaraway calls for a revision of the concept of gender, moving away from Western patriarchal essentialism and toward \"the utopian dream of the hope for a monstrous world without gender,\" stating that \"Cyborgs might consider more seriously the partial, fluid, sometimes aspect of sex and sexual embodiment. Gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth.\"\n\nHaraway also calls for a reconstruction of identity, no longer dictated by naturalism and taxonomy but instead by affinity, wherein individuals can construct their own groups by choice. In this way, groups may construct a \"post-modernist identity out of otherness, difference, and specificity\" as a way to counter Western traditions of exclusive identification.\n\nAlthough Haraway's metaphor of the cyborg has been labelled as a post-gender statement, Haraway has clarified her stance on post-genderism in some interviews. She acknowledges that her argument in the \"Manifesto \"seeks to challenge the necessity for categorization of gender, but does not correlate this argument to post-genderism. She clarifies this distinction because post-genderism is often associated with the discourse of the utopian concept of being beyond masculinity and femininity. Haraway notes that gender constructs are still prevalent and meaningful, but are troublesome and should therefore be eliminated as categories for identity.\n\nAlthough Donna Haraway intended her concept of the cyborg to be a feminist critique, she acknowledges that other scholars and popular media have taken her concept and applied it to different contexts. Haraway is aware and receptive of the different uses of her concept of the cyborg, but admits \"very few people are taking what I consider all of its parts\". \"Wired Magazine\" overlooked the feminist theory of the cyborg and instead used it to make a more literal commentary about the enmeshment of humans and technology. Despite this, Haraway also recognizes that new feminist scholars \"embrace and use the cyborg of the manifesto to do what they want for their own purposes\".\n\nPatchwork Girl, a hypertext work, makes use of elements from \"Cyborg Manifesto\". \"Patchwork Girl's\" \"thematic focus on the connections between monstrosity, subjectivity, and new reproductive technologies is apparent from its very first page, when readers, or users, open the hypertext to find a picture of a scarred and naked female body sewn together with a single dotted line...Readers enter the text by clicking on this body and following its 'limbs' or links to different sections of the text.\" In Jackson's narrative, the Patchwork Girl is an aborted female monster created by Victor Frankenstein of Mary Shelley's 1818 novel \"Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, \"is an abhorrent and monstrous creature that is \"part male, part female, part animal, 175 years old, and 'razed' up through hypertext technology.\" The monster, following her destruction by Victor, is sewn back together by Mary Shelley herself, while simultaneously becoming Mary's lover; she is thus, \"a cyborg who is queer, dis-proportioned, and visibly scarred. She both facilitates and undermines preoccupations with the benefits and dangers of reproductive technologies by embracing all of the monstrosities that reproductive/fetal screenings are imagined to 'catch' and one day prevent.\" The Patchwork Girl embraces Haraway's conception of a cybernetic posthuman being in both her physical multiplicity and her challenge towards \"the images and fantasies sustaining reproductive politics.\"\n\nTurkish critical scholar Leman Giresunlu uses Haraway's cyborg as framework to examine current science fiction movies such as \" \"and Resident Evil in her essay \"Cyborg Goddesses: The Mainframe Revisited\". In this essay, she explores how her new concept of the \"cyborg goddess, \"a female figure \"capable of inflicting pain and pleasure simultaneously\",\" \" can be used to make sense of how female representation is shifting towards a more multidimensional stance. Giresunlu builds from Haraway's cyborg because the \"cyborg goddess\" goes beyond \"offering a way out from [the] duality\" and instead provides how spirituality and technology work together to form a complex and more accurate representation of women.\n\nIn her essay \"Mind Over Matter: Mental Evolution and Physical Devolution in The Incredible Shrinking Man\", American critical scholar Ruthellen Cunnally uses Haraway's cyborg to help make sense of how Robert Scott Carey, the protagonist of \"The Incredible Shrinking Man\", transforms into a cyborg in the midst of a metaphor of cold war politics in his home. As Robert continues to shrink, the gendered power dynamic between him and his wife Louise shifts from \"the realm of husband/wife into the mode of mother/son\". When Robert finds himself lost in the feminine space of the basement, an area of the house that was reserved for Louise's domestic duties of sewing and washing, he is forced to fight for his life and reclaim his masculinity. Although he is able to conquer some of his foes and regain his \"manhood\", the gender lines do not become established again because there is no one to share and implement the gendered power structure with. Robert's transformation presents \"an existence in which acceptance and meaning are released from the limitations of patriarchal dualisms\", which aligns with Haraway's cyborg.\n\nTraditional feminists have criticized \"A Cyborg Manifesto\" as anti-feminist because it denies any commonalities of the female experience. In the \"Manifesto,\" Haraway writes \"there is nothing about being 'female' that naturally binds women\", which goes against a defining characteristic of traditional feminism that calls women to join together in order to advocate for members of their gender.\n\nCriticism and controversy were built into the essay's publication history: the East Coast Collective of the \"Socialist Review\" found the piece \"a naive embrace of technology\" and advocated against its publication, while The Berkeley Collective ultimately insisted that it go to print. The essay has been described as \"controversial\" and \"viral\" in its circulation through multiple academic departments and disciplinary boundaries, contributing to the critical discourse on its claims.\nThis controversiality was matched by its omnipresence; Jackie Orr, Associate Professor of Sociology at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, writes, \"It is hard to be a feminist graduate student in the U.S. humanities or social sciences after 1985 and not be touched in some way by the cyborg manifesto.\" The rapid adoption of the article in academic circles also increased the pace of the critical conversation surrounding the work, and in 1990, Haraway felt that the essay had \"acquired a surprise half life,\" which made it \"impossible to rewrite\" and necessitated revisiting the topic in her subsequent publications.\n\nMany critiques of \"A Cyborg Manifesto\" focus on a basic level of reader comprehension and writing style, such as Orr's observation that \"undergraduate students in a science and technology class find the cyborg manifesto curiously relevant but somewhat impenetrable to read.\" This is corroborated by Helen Merrick and Margret Grebowicz's observation that scientists who reviewed \"Primate Visions\" had similar issues, particularly as related to Haraway's use of irony. Judy Wajcman, Professor of Sociology at the London School of Economics and Political Science, suggests in \"TechnoFeminism\" that \"the openness of her writing to a variety of readings is intentional,\" which \"can sometimes make Haraway difficult to interpret;\" however, it does not seem that Wajcman critiques Haraway's tone for its capability to encompass more possibilities, rather than limit them. Wajcman concludes her chapter \"Send in the Cyborgs\" on a critical note, claiming that \"Certainly, Haraway is much stronger at providing evocative figurations of a new feminist subjectivity than she is at providing guidelines for a practical emancipatory politics.\" \n\nCritiques of Haraway have also centered on the accessibility of the thematic topics she discusses in her writing, and according to third-wave feminist readings, her work \"assumes a reader who is familiar with North American culture,\" and posits that \"readers without the appropriate cultural capital are...likely to find it infuriatingly obscure and impenetrable.\" Therefore, Haraway's symbolism is representative of North American culture symbolizing a \"non-universalizing vision for feminist strategies\" and \"has been taken up within cyberfeminism as the symbol of an essential female being.\" Considering the question of accessibility more broadly, disability studies have focused on Haraway's essay, noting the absence of \"any kind of critical engagement with disability...disabled bodies are simply presented as exemplary...requiring neither analysis nor critique\"—a gap which Alison Kafer, Professor of Feminist Studies at Southwestern University, attempts to address in \"Feminist, Queer, Crip\". Wajcman also argues that Haraway's view of technology in \"A Cyborg Manifesto\" is perhaps too totalizing, and that the binary of \"the cyborg solution and the goddess solution\" ultimately \"caricatures feminism\" by focusing too readily on a dichotomy that may in fact be a false one.\n\nIn \"Unfinished Work-From Cyborg to Cognisphere\", N. Katherine Hayles questions the validity of cyborg as a unit of analysis. She says that because of the complicated situation of technology and media, “cyborg is no longer the individual person – or for that matter, the individual cyborg – is no longer the appropriate unit of analysis, if indeed it ever was.”\n\nAs for the relationships between cyborg and religion, Robert A. Campbell argues that “in spite of Haraway's efforts to move beyond traditional Western dualisms and offer a new hope for women, and by extension a of humanity and the world, what she in fact offers is a further legitimation for buying into the not so new American civil religion of high technology.” He says that “in spite of what some may view as a radical critique of the present and a potentially frightening prescription for the future, the stark reality about Haraway's 'postmodern reality' is that there is no such thing.”\n\nBeyond its presence in academic context, \"A Cyborg Manifesto\" has also had popular traction including Wired Magazine's piece by Hari Kunzru and Mute Magazine, BuzzFeed,\n\nScholar Marilyn Maness Mehaffy writes that the \"sonographic fetus is in many ways the ultimate cyborg in that it is 'created' in a space of virtuality that straddles the conventional boundary between an organic body and a digital text.\" Yet it is this cyborg that presents a limit to Haraway's posthuman theory. The sonographic fetus, as posited by scholar Heather Latimer, \"is publicly envisioned as both independent of [its mother's] body and as independent of the sonographic equipment used to read this body. We know that fetal images are depictions, yet the sonogram invokes a documentary-like access to fetuses that makes it easy to ignore this, which in turn can limit the authority and agency of pregnant women.\" In positioning the fetus as independent, and consequently oppositional, to the pregnant mother, these reproductive technologies \"reinscribe stable meanings to the human/machine dualism they supposedly disrupt.\" Valerie Hartouni argues, \"most reproductive technologies have assimilated into the 'order of nature'\" which would make Haraway's vision of a regenerative species, unrestricted by heteronormative conceptions of reproduction, unattainable in the sonographic fetus.\n\nHaraway began writing the \"Manifesto \"in 1983 to address the \"Socialist Review \"request of American socialist feminists to ponder over the future of socialist feminism in the context of the early Reagan era and the decline of leftist politics. The first versions of the essay had a strong socialist and European connection that the \"Socialist Review \"East Coast Collective found too controversial to publish. The Berkeley \"Socialist Review\" Collective published the essay in 1985 under the editor Jeff Escoffier. The essay was most widely read as part of Haraway's 1991 book \"Simians, Cyborgs and Women\".\n\n\n"}

(A frequently-cited source for philosophical relativism in postmodern theory is a fragment by Nietzsche, entitled \"On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense.\")\n\nFor example, in historical terms, the female form as depicted in the Venus of Willendorf and the women in the paintings of Rubens would today be regarded as over-weight, while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors. In contemporary (cross-cultural) terms, body modification among \"primitive\" peoples is sometimes regarded as grotesque by Western society. \n\nAesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism, which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the \"external world\", and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true. Other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism (the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative) and Ethical Relativism (the claim that moral judgments are relative). Aesthetic and ethical relativism are sub-categories of Cognitive Relativism. Philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include David Hume, particularly his \"radical scepticism\" as set out in A Treatise of Human Nature; Thomas Kuhn, with regard to the history and philosophy of science, and particularly his work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions; Friedrich Nietzsche, in moral philosophy and epistemology; and Richard Rorty, on the contingency of language.\n\nPhilosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include Plato, and in particular his Theory of the Forms; Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, despite being subjective, is a universally practiced function of the mind; Noam Chomsky, whose \"nativist\" theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar (i.e., that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is).\n\nThe most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was Immanuel Kant, who argued that the judgment of beauty, while subjective, is universal. \n"}

He was born in 1944 in Damascus, Syria to an aristocratic family, and moved to Germany in 1962 where he later became a citizen in 1976. He is known for his analysis of international relations and the introduction of Islam to the study of international conflict and of civilization. Tibi is known for introducing the controversial concept of European \"Leitkultur\" as well as the concept of \"Euroislam\" to discussions about integration of Muslim immigrants to countries in Europe. He is also the founder of \"Islamology\" as a social-scientific study of Islam and conflict in post-bipolar politics. Tibi has done research in Asian and African countries. He publishes in English, German and Arabic.\n\nHe studied in Frankfurt am Main under Max Horkheimer, obtaining his Ph.D. there in 1971, and later habilitated in Hamburg, Germany. From 1973 until his retirement in 2009, he was Professor for International Relations at Göttingen University. Parallel to this appointment he was, from 1982 to 2000, at Harvard University in a variety of affiliations, the latest being a 1998 to 2000 stint as The Bosch Fellow. Currently, he is an A.D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University. Tibi had eighteen visiting professorships in all continents including fellowships in Princeton University, UC Berkeley, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, and most recently (2010) at the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies, Washington D.C. Tibi was also a visiting senior fellow at Yale University. After his retirement in 2009, he published \"Islam's Predicament with Cultural Modernity\", a book embodying his life's work.\n\nTibi is a Muslim, but criticizes Islamism and advocates \"reforming\" Islam. Tibi also suggests that Muslim immigrants should refrain from engaging in religious missionary activities, \"Dawa\".\n\nWhen it comes to Europe, Tibi distinguishes positive and negative elements of European culture. The positive ones are, according to Tibi, enlightenment, pluralism, civil rights and secularization. Tibi argues that there is a need for Europe to defend these values, especially in times of globalization and migration from Muslim countries. On the other hand, Tibi argues that racism is a European invention, and that Europeans must overcome what he calls \"Euro-arrogance\" and xenophobia to integrate immigrants.\n\nHe criticizes European imperialism, arguing that it disrupted and deformed other cultures. Acknowledging that Muslim conquerors also did some wrong, Tibi argues that at least Muslim conquests were not driven by any kind of racism, unlike the European conquests.\n\nHe has criticised the left-green dominated German media for stifling debate about Islam in Germany, leading to ordinary people being afraid to state their opinions. As an example he gives Uwe Tellkamp, who expressed criticisim against the German policy of migration and was attacked in mainstream media and painted as a right-extremist. He has also criticised authorities in Germany for not standing up to the large organised Islamic community organisations like the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs and for not supporting liberal Muslims like Seyran Ateş and Necla Kelek.\n\nBassam Tibi has criticized the Likud party of Israel as blocking the peace process. He states that in the 1990s, the Likud adopted the \"Three Nos\" policy:\n\"No to the Palestinian State, no to dividing Jerusalem, no to returning Golan Heights to Syria.\n\nAccording to Tibi, the Likud government of 1996 engaged in provoking Arabs by constructing Har Homa in Arab Jerusalem, and digging a tunnel under the Temple Mount, and thereby exposing Israel to terrorism.\n\nIn 1995 he was decorated by the President of Germany, Roman Herzog, with the Bundesverdienstkreuz, cross of merits first class. In 2003, the Swiss Foundation for European Awareness granted him in Zurich with the annual prize.\n\n\n\n"}

The society sponsors exhibitions, contests for student book collectors and Virginia printers, an international speakers’ series, and an active publications program which has produced over 175 separate publication in addition to its journal \"Studies in Bibliography\".\n\nThe society was led for many years by Fredson Bowers, a University of Virginia faculty member, and was influential in applying and spreading the theories of textual criticism developed by Bowers and W. W. Greg which brought about changes in the study of manuscripts and the printing of books to ascertain the original intentions of authors. \n\nAfter several years of preparation, on February 26, 1947 a group met in the University of Virginia library in Charlottesville and adopted a constitution that declared the object of their new society to be \"to foster an interest in books (including books in manuscript), maps, printing, and bibliography.\" The group called \"The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia.\" The inaugural address was given by Fredson Bowers, a member of the faculty, speaking on \"Some Problems and Practices in Bibliographical Descriptions of Modern Authors,\" The leadership in the early years fell to Bowers, to John Cook Wyllie, and to Linton Massey. Bowers served as President in the Society's second and third years, 1948 and 1949, and then from its fifth year, 1951, up to 1974. By the late 1960s, the Society had nearly 1,000 members. Irby Cauthen, a charter member, became President in 1978. He was succeeded in 1993 by G.

Tanselle served as president of the society 1993-2006.\n\n\"The Papers of the Bibliographical Society\" of the University of Virginia was started in 1948 as an annual journal dedicated to the study of books as physical objects and to textual criticism and scholarly editing; Bowers served as the journal's editor until his death in 1991. It was renamed \"Studies in Bibliography\" for volume 2. Bowers conceived of the journal as one that encompassed all bibliographical study, with no restriction as to the geographical origins or periods or genres of the material examined. The topics of articles in Volume I (1948-1949), for instance, ranged from an unpublished manuscript by Thomas Jefferson, Elizabethan drama, and the use of watermarks as bibliographical evidence to catalogs issued by 16th century booksellers. Volume III (1950) opened with four major essays on textual matters: R. C. Bald's \"Editorial Problems--A Preliminary Survey,\" W. W. Greg's \"The Rationale of Copy-Text,\" Bowers's \"Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems,\" and Archibald A. Hill's \"Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts.\" G. Thomas Tanselle called Greg's article \"one of the most seminal papers in the history of English scholarship.\" \n\nBook length publications range from bibliographies of contemporary authors such as Peter Taylor and Hilda Doolittle (H.D.), to studies of Shakespearean promptbooks, with an especially large number of works on the problems and theory of textual editing, including collections of essays by Bowers and Tanselle.\n\nIn 1991, editorship of \"Studies in Bibliography\" passed to David L.

The game was released during October 2009 in North America, Europe, and Australia. Though \"Brütal Legend\" was originally to be published by Vivendi Games prior to its merger with Activision, Activision dropped the game from its portfolio after the merger. It was later picked up by Electronic Arts, though Activision and Double Fine brought counter-lawsuits against each other over publishing issues. The issues were settled out of court. Later, Double Fine announced a port of the game for Microsoft Windows via Steam, which was released in February 2013. Mac OS X and Linux versions of the game were made available as part of the Humble Bundle in May 2013. A physical collector's edition for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux was released by IndieBox in October 2014.\n\nTim Schafer, the game's creative director, was inspired to create the game by his own past musical experiences. The game features the character of Eddie Riggs, voiced by and modeled after Jack Black, a roadie who is transported to a fantasy world inspired by the artwork of heavy metal album covers. Eddie becomes the world's savior, leading the down-trodden humans against a range of supernatural overlords using a battle axe, his Flying V guitar that can tap into the magical powers of the world, and a customizable hot rod.\n\nThe game, a hybrid of the action-adventure and real-time strategy genres, includes Stage Battles in both the single-player and multiplayer mode, where the player must command troops to defeat their foes while defending their own stage. In addition to Black, the game features voices of heavy metal musicians including Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne and Lita Ford and other celebrities such as Tim Curry, as well as more than one hundred metal songs selected by Schafer for inclusion in the game.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" was generally well received by game reviewers, praising Schafer's vision and writing of the heavy metal-inspired world, and the performances of the voice cast, particularly Black and Osbourne. Some felt that the hybrid gameplay of action and real-time strategy games did not mix well, however, blaming console control limitations and missing features normally found in games of either genre.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" is a third person action/adventure game incorporating real time strategy elements. The game uses an open world that Tim Schafer has described as being approximately in area. The player controls the protagonist Eddie Riggs, a roadie who one day finds himself transported into a heavy metal-themed fantasy world. Eddie acquires three tools that are used for combat and transportation: a broad axe called \"The Separator\", his Flying V guitar \"Clementine\" from his own world which has the ability to cast magic spells in the heavy metal world, and a hot rod that Eddie builds called \"The Druid Plow\", a.k.a. \"The Deuce\". Spells, referred to as \"Solos\", from Clementine are performed by playing a minigame akin to the note-matching aspect of \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band\" over a brief guitar riff; however, Eddie cannot use the metal generated by Clementine constantly, as prolonged usage of the guitar will cause it to overheat, and the player will have to wait for a cool-off period before using the guitar's power again. Eddie may also find more solos hidden throughout the world, ranging from support to offensive spells. The player can spend in-game currency called \"Fire Tributes\", earned from completing missions, at the Motor Forge to gain new abilities and upgrades for each tool. These tools can be used in combination with each other to take out Eddie's foes; for example, the player can use his guitar Clementine to create pyrotechnics to launch a foe into the air and follow up by attack it with the Separator axe. In a case of a specific boss fight, the player must use the Deuce hot rod to lure the boss to a spiked gate held up by counterweights, and then play the \"Earthshaker\" move on Clementine to destroy the weights and sever the creature's head.\n\nWithin the open world, the player can use a map and the Deuce's turn signals to guide them towards either story-advancing missions or side missions. Side missions include hot-rod races against a demon, defending Eddie's allies from a pending attack, or helping a cannon operator spot his targets. There are about 23 main missions in the story with 30 side missions that the player can optionally take. The player can also explore the game's world to find statues bound in leather or chains that can be freed to gain a health boost for Eddie or to reveal part of the game's backstory, and can look through special telescopes at vistas or complete certain jumps to earn additional Fire Tributes. The player can also find monuments they can raise that unlock an additional heavy metal song from the game's soundtrack that can be played on the Deuce's radio, \"The Mouth of Metal\"; the player can further customize its set list with songs they have been rewarded with or have collected.\nSeveral main story missions of the game are Stage Battles based on real time strategy elements. The player, while still in control of Eddie, is required to defend a giant stage where new allies will spawn, holding out until a specific objective is completed. The player creates an army for attacks by building merchandise booths on \"fan geysers\" through Clementine's magic. Once enough fans are collected, the player can summon different allies, each consuming a specific number of fans, or upgrade their stage to allow them to produce more powerful allies. A character known as Mangus acts as the \"sound guy\" to help in the construction of these units and stage upgrades, and also warns the player of enemy attacks. Once the player has gathered their army, they can then seek out and attack their opponents. Eddie is able to control the entire army to follow, attack, or defend a point, and can use specialized squads of specific units to perform certain tasks, such as having a group of headbangers use their headbanging to destroy statues. The player can also use Eddie directly in combat during this battles. Ultimately, Eddie transforms into a winged demon who can fly above the battlefields to issue orders or lay out attacks. Spells in Eddie's arsenal can help control the performance of his armies, such as temporarily boosting their attack skills or creating a rally flag which troops will gather at, while others hinder the performance of the enemy faction by removing enemy buffs or preventing the creation of enemy units for a short time. Each of the different units, including special allies that Eddie meets in the game, has a special co-op move they can perform with Eddie; for example, Eddie's first ally, Ophelia, can be tossed at foes by Eddie in the style of the Fastball Special. These co-op moves are also available outside of Stage Battle missions.\n\nThe game has a multiplayer mode, described by Schafer as \"your typical head-to-head, battle of the bands scenario. But with axes.\" The multiplayer modes are team-based and play in the same manner as the single-player Stage Battles, with team sizes from one-versus-one to four-versus-four. Each team selects from one of three factions which affect what resources and troops they can summon, and are tasked with defending their stage from attack by the other team. The three factions available are Ironheade, mostly human-based troops led by Eddie Riggs; The Drowning Doom, with more Goth/Black Metal creatures led by Ophelia; and The Tainted Coil, evil creatures controlled by Doviculus. Each player controls a single main avatar who has the same abilities as in the main game for combat and magic spells and can also fly about the map, but also is in control of troops that they may summon from the team's shared resources—fans as generated by fan geysers across the map. Different types of troops are available, costing various numbers of fans to summon, with the potential to upgrade to improved units through different routes. The number and types of troops that can be summoned is limited by a cap to prevent either team from becoming too overpowered. All of the troops can be engaged by the player to initiate various \"Double Team\" moves as with the single player game. The game can also be played by a single player with computer-controller opponents at one of five difficulty levels.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" follows the story of Eddie Riggs (voiced by Jack Black), who is \"the world's best roadie\" for \"the world's \"worst\" 'heavy metal' band\", Kabbage Boy. Much of the game takes place in an unnamed world inspired by heavy metal music, created by, according to the game's mythology, Ormagöden, The Eternal Firebeast, Cremator of the Sky, and Destroyer of the Ancient World. In this alternate world, the human race is enslaved by a race of demons, led by Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil, (voiced by Tim Curry). Doviculus is assisted by his glam metal human minion, General Lionwhyte (voiced by Rob Halford and based on David Bowie with the name being an allusion to glammetal band White Lion) whose hair is so big \"and luscious\" that he uses it to fly, flapping it like a pair of broad wings. Leading the fight against Doviculus are a small band of human resistance fighters with whom Eddie joins forces: Lars Halford (voiced by Zach Hanks), his sister Lita (voiced by Kath Soucie), and Ophelia (voiced by Jennifer Hale), whom Eddie takes a romantic interest in. Their group is later joined by the stage manager Mangus (Alex Fernandez), the bass-playing healer Kill Master (voiced by, and patterned after Lemmy Kilmister), the motorcycle-riding Fire Baron (also voiced by Halford, as well as visually inspired by him too), and the Amazonian Rima (voiced by Lita Ford and based on KISS characters). Also supporting Eddie is the Guardian of Metal (voiced by Ozzy Osbourne, who also lent his appearance to the character) that assists in upgrading his equipment.\n\nDuring a gig for Kabbage Boy, Eddie is crushed by falling scenery while trying to save a member of the band; his blood lands on his belt buckle, in reality an amulet for Ormagöden. The stage is transformed into Ormagöden, who kills the band and takes the unconscious Eddie to the heavy metal world. Awaking in the Temple of Ormagöden, Eddie meets with Ophelia while fighting Doviculus' forces, developing a crush on her. They discover writings left by the Titans that Eddie is able to comprehend, and build a hot-rod, the \"Deuce\", that they use to escape the Temple and travel to Bladehenge, the base for the small human resistance force led by Lars and Lita. When they meet Eddie and learn he can understand the Titans' messages, they see him as a prophetical \"Chosen One\", though unsure if he will be the savior or destroyer of the world. Ophelia also becomes concerned when Eddie, in the heat of battle, transforms into a winged creature, an effect Eddie decides to use to his advantage at the time.\n\nEddie helps Lars, Lita, and Ophelia create an army, named \"Ironheade\" to fight against General Lionwhyte. They successfully raid Lionwhyte's \"Pleasure Tower\" and defeat him. However, as they celebrate, Doviculus arrives, sending the group into hiding. Doviculus is aware of the presence of his spy \"Succoria\" by the smell of her blood as it was at the Temple; Eddie and his allies come to believe Ophelia is Doviculus' spy. Lars leaves his hiding spot to face Doviculus, but is quickly killed. As the Tainted Coil destroy the tower, Ironheade escapes into the nearby mountains; Eddie is forced to leave with Lita leaving Ophelia behind despite their shared love. Heartbroken, Ophelia is drawn toward the Sea of Black Tears, cursed waters that grant humans supernatural abilities at the cost of humanity. After leaping into the black waters, the Sea creates a dark doppelganger of Ophelia, who raises an army of other Black Tear-corrupted humans, the goth \"Drowning Doom\". After three months, she leads an attack on Ironheade's mountain camp. Though Ironheade defeats the assault, Eddie determines they must destroy the Sea to end her threat. As they travel through exotic lands and find more allies out of the pyromanical Fire Barons and the amazonian Zaulia tribe, they come across evidence of Eddie's father, the hero known as Riggnarok in this time. It tells that Riggnarok traveled to the future to attempt to learn the secrets of the Titans to bring back to the past in the humans' ongoing fight against the demons, but never returned.\n\nWith their new allies, Ironheade manages to push the Drowning Doom back towards the Sea of Black Tears; defeated, Ophelia denies Eddie's belief that she is Doviculus' spy, again claiming that Eddie's the traitor. As they argue, Doviculus arrives and confirms that Succoria is not Ophelia, but Eddie's mother. In the past, Succoria, an even more vicious demon empress, also sought the Titans' secrets in the future. However, after discovering that humans eventually become the dominant species, Succoria fell into a deep despair. Riggnarok, who had followed Succoria through time to assassinate her, took pity on her in her misery, and the two fell in love and bore Eddie. Now in the past, Eddie's demon nature has borne out, and has also inadvertently revealed the Titans' secrets to Doviculus as well. Having no more use for Ophelia, Doviculus rips out her heart, taking her powers alongside his own and causing Ophelia to dissipate. While Ironheade battles Doviculus' forces, Eddie engages Doviculus in a one-on-one confrontation, which ends with the demon emperor's decapitation. As Eddie escapes the Sea, he recovers Ophelia's heart from Doviculus, containing his mother's necklace he gave her when they first met, and then proceeds to rescue the real Ophelia from the ocean floor. Ashore, they rekindle their love as Ironheade celebrates their victory over Doviculus and the Tainted Coil. Back at Bladehenge, a statue to Lars is erected, while Lita continues to lead the troops against the remaining demons. Eddie insists on maintaining his \"roadie\" presence, staying behind the scenes and making others look good. After he promises he is not leaving to his assembled friends, Eddie takes off to complete a few errands, with Ophelia watching as he drives off into the sunset, shedding a single black tear.\n\nCreator Tim Schafer has said that he has been a heavy metal music fan since high school, and roadies have long fascinated him. As Schafer said in 2007, \"The name was one of the very first things I thought of, over fifteen years ago. I was riding a bus, thinking about a game that would be the complete opposite of what we were working on, \"The Secret of Monkey Island\" [a Lucasfilm Games title released in 1990]. And \"Brütal Legend\" leapt into my head. I've been hanging on to that name ever since.\" The title, which he describes as sounding \"like the hardest core fantasy thing out there\", makes use of the metal umlaut. The idea behind the game first came to Schafer about fifteen years prior to its release, but its core concepts did not completely come together until after the completion of \"Psychonauts\" (2005), when he presented his idea for the game to the team, they became excited at the concept and decided to make that their next title.\n\nPart of the game's inspiration came from the fantasy worlds that the lyrics and album covers of metal bands implied but rarely made it to music videos, thus allowing \"Brütal Legend\" to \"fulfill the promise\" of such lore. Schafer also credits a Megadeth roadie named Tony he once met as having given him the idea to make a game about a roadie, with the character of Eddie Riggs becoming a re-imagined version of him. Schafer had previously explored the idea of a roadie sent back in time with the character of Hoagie from \"Day of the Tentacle\", but \"Brütal Legend\" represented an opportunity to expand on it further. The 2003 movie \"School of Rock\" also reminded Schafer of his idea for \"Brütal Legend\", and made him more excited to publish it. Double Fine's philosophy on game development was also another reason for \"Brütal Legend\"'s creation, as Schafer has stated that his team attempts to make each game radically different from the company's previous release, contrasting \"Brütal Legend\" to \"Psychonauts\". Schafer stated that the commercial tie-ins of \"Brütal Legend\", such as \"hot babes and Jack Black\", is due to this philosophy and not due to market pressures. Schafer was not concerned about the commercial success of \"Brütal Legend\", as despite poor sales of \"Psychonauts\", \"as long as you make a cool game, publishers want to talk to you\". When Schafer was pitching the game before 2006, he received feedback about changing the game's style to hip hop or country. He credits Harmonix Music Systems for influencing the rhythm game market through the release of the widely successful \"Guitar Hero\" with a soundtrack that heavily emphasized metal music; with the popularity of \"Guitar Hero\", the metal approach in \"Brütal Legend\" was readily accepted.\n\nSchafer has pointed out that there are music term inspired attacks, such as a \"Face-Melting\" guitar solo, which literally will melt the foe's faces off. The metal/motorcyclist lifestyles and Norse mythology also inspired the game's open-world environments, such as amps carved into the face of a mountain, a forest where tires replace leaves, giant axes and swords piercing the ground, spandex covered temples, and mining facilities where human slaves excavated car and motorcycle parts. However, Schafer noted that they attempted to make sure that non-metal fans would be able to get the jokes as well.\n\nThe art style for the game was based on the work of Frank Frazetta and inspired by heavy metal and rock album covers. The team only considered the addition of elements to the artwork if they felt it would be something that could be seen on such covers. The setting includes hot rod-like engines that grow from the earth like a \"V8 Truffle Of Speed\", with design inspired by the designs of Ed \"Big Daddy\" Roth. The art team wanted to avoid creating \"another brown-gray game\", and strove to use the wide color palettes that are associated with heavy metal art. Cutscenes in the game use the game's engine, though some pre-recorded scenes from the engine have also been prepared with the help of Tasha Harris, a former Pixar employee who helped to animate character's faces during cutscenes.\n\nThe game features over 80 unique characters in addition to the main protagonist, Eddie Riggs. Initial designs for Riggs was modeled after Lemmy Kilmister, and though the model was changed, the signature vest, tour pass and cigarette of the character remained part of the character design. As the character continued to develop, they began to add more aspects of Black's character, an \"enthusiastic fan\" of music, from \"School of Rock\". Ultimately, Riggs' design came to become half Jack Black and half Glenn Danzig. The art team was able to use videos of Black's performances to add additional features to the character, such as \"all his crazy eyebrow stuff he does\". General Lionwhyte, who has \"fabulous hair\", and his minions are based on the glam metal fad of the 1980s which displaced heavy metal to the disappointment of Schafer and other development team members, and became the opponents of the game. To help create a more mature game with concepts that could be used to pitch the game, the art team created several factions that represented different parts of the heavy metal experience. Each faction had their own \"exaggerated, simplified shapes and strong silhouettes\" as to help distinguish each faction while also reducing the development costs. Inspirations for such factions include Nordic imagery, goth metal, and the artwork of Hieronymus Bosch. Additional characters include headbangers, \"gravediggers\", and \"battle nuns\". As the game features over two hours of spoken dialog, the art team wants to make the characters' faces and performances stand out, creating \"clean, easy-to-read faces\". The team had to change from their initial cartoony textures into more detailed ones that stood out on high-definition displays while exaggerating other features of the characters.\n\nThe user interface and menus were created by Joe Kowalski, who had previously worked on similar game elements for \"Guitar Hero\", \"Guitar Hero II\", and the \"Rock Band\" series. Much of the game's interface elements used a medieval woodcut art style, and were designed to contrast well against the world's graphics. The introductory menu is presented as an interactive movie created from live action clips of Jack Black manipulating a prop gatefold vinyl record album, using Adobe After Effects to provide the on-screen text, controls handling, and stitching of separate scenes into a seamless movie.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" includes over 35,000 lines of spoken dialog, mostly written by Schafer. In addition to Black, Lemmy, Judas Priest's Rob Halford, The Runaways' Lita Ford, and Ozzy Osbourne provide character voices for these lines.\n\nSchafer's original vision for the game had not anticipated a celebrity cast. In particular, though Eddie came to resemble Black, the team had not planned on having Jack Black voice the character. After learning that Black was a fan of Schafer's previous game, \"Psychonauts\", they met with the actor/musician and recognized he was an avid gamer and metal fan and understood all the choices the team made in the game, and subsequently signed on for the voice work. Black also performed live-action sequences as himself used for the in-game menu screens and additional promotional material. Once Black had signed up for the project, Schafer found that other artists and people involved in the heavy metal scene became very interested in participating though a domino effect and word of mouth, allowing Schafer to sign them on as voice talent or as part of the game's soundtrack.\n\nLemmy was brought on board to play The Kill Master after Schafer and his team had developed the character's role in the story who assists Eddie by healing his allies through a giant bass harp on the back of a chopper. The original character, a man with a top hat and beard, was considered out of place by Schafer, leading him to consider famous bass guitar players and quickly recognizing the need to have Lemmy play that role. Halford plays two characters, General Lionwhyte and The Baron. Schafer had selected Lionwhyte to capture Halford's ability to scream, and found his abilities in the studio beyond what they expected. They created The Baron character specifically for Halford, as while Lionwhyte was considered a \"heavy metal Stewie [from \"Family Guy\"]\", that character was the complete opposite of Halford, while The Baron captures both Halford and Judas Priest's attitude. Lita Ford voices Rima, queen of a group of \"Amazon-like jungle women\"; Schafer considered the similarities between the lack of clothing that Rima was designed with and Ford's outfits from the 1980s, staying true to the development teams' memories of her. Osbourne plays The Guardian of Metal who helps the player upgrade their equipment; Schafer commented that both the character and Osbourne, while dark and brooding, are \"really upbeat\" and \"optimistic\".\n\nThough Ronnie James Dio of the band Dio had performed parts for the game, his role was replaced with voice work from Tim Curry. While the change was speculated to be due to tense issues between Osbourne and Dio, Schafer noted that as Dio's intended character, \"Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil\", grew, they found that Curry fit the role better for the part, citing Curry's role of the Lord of Darkness in the film \"Legend\" as a key factor; Schafer would also later state that Dio's part was cut due to a combination of \"really complicated reasons\" and other circumstances outside their control. Curry considered the role \"perfect\" for him when Schafer described Doviculus to him as \"big and tough, but also has this kinky side who, when hit with an ax, might scream in pain or squeal with delight\".\n\nSimilar to their experience with bringing Black onto the project, obtaining the voicework of the metal artists were also unexpected but beneficial. This led to some confusion during voice recording sessions; both Lita Ford and Rob Halford had difficulties with lines involving a character named \"Lita Halford\". Furthermore, both Black and Osbourne frequently injected profanity into their scripted lines during recording sessions. Instead of rerecording these, the development left these in the game, but included the option for a profanity content filter to be enabled by the player to \"bleep\" out these words and mask such word on screen using the Parents Music Resource Center \"Parental Advisory\" label, an icon that Schafer considered to be part of the history of heavy metal. A similar filter exists for gore in the game, preventing any dismemberment and disabling blood in the game. Schafer stated the filters were added to the game in consideration of older players that may not wish to see such aspects, or for parents who opt to play the game with younger children. During development, Schafer stated that while he could not confirm what other musicians and bands would be in the game, there would be more than already stated, and that these musicians were \"especially conducive to character creation\" due to the amount of theatrics used in their concert shows.\n\nKyle Gass, Black's collaborator with Tenacious D, voices and lends his facial likeness to a neurotic cannon operator in the game. Comedians David Cross, Steve Agee, Brian Posehn, and Wil Wheaton have also provided voice work for the game; Posehn had previously worked with Schafer on their high school newspaper. David Sobolov was also confirmed as a voice actor for other roles in the game; Sobolov noted that he recorded his lines separate from Black's despite his characters' having direct interaction with Riggs. Richard Horvitz, who voiced protagonist Raz in Schafer's previous game, \"Psychonauts\", cameos as the lead guitarist of Kabbage Boy and as a car-lift operator that assigns Eddie certain side missions. Further voice acting work has been provided by veteran video game actors such as Zach Hanks, Kath Soucie, Dino Andrade and Jennifer Hale.\n\nAccording to Schafer, \"Brütal Legend\" had been in development since 2007, prior to the completion of \"Psychonauts\". Schafer noted that in \"Psychonauts\", they attempted to bring together a lot of assets, including characters and environments, but were not able to successfully integrate them on their first attempt and had to start over on the development of some. In several cases for \"Psychonauts\", changes made in gameplay required them to return and redesign levels to account for the new features. The company decided at the start to use the scrum development approach for \"Brütal Legend\", which they found worked well with their company's culture, allowing them to quickly arrive at playable targets at every milestone. For example, the team was able to bring about their terrain engine, renderer, and a playable Eddie Riggs within a month of development, and by the third month, the ability for Eddie to drive about the terrain, running over hordes of enemies.\n\nSchafer stated that they began the development with the character of Eddie, and recognizing what he should be doing in the game—specifically, swinging around his axe, playing his guitar, and driving his hot rod. Once they found this combination of elements to work well in combat and general gameplay, they were able to expand out the rest of the game from there, as these elements provided a means of testing the game to make sure it remained enjoyable. The first major feature developed for the game was the multiplayer element, given that no previous game from Double Fine had included this feature, and was the highest risk element to the game.\nThe multiplayer gameplay itself was inspired by older strategy games, in particular, 1989's \"Herzog Zwei\"; in this game, the player controlled a transforming aircraft mecha that would normally fly about the field to issue orders for constructing new units, airlifting units to other areas, and directing combat, but the player could opt to transform the craft into a giant robot and engage directly in combat. For \"Brütal Legend\", Schafer kept the same concept of a split-mode RTS, but wanted more focus on the ground combat; instead of spending 90% of the time controlling units as in \"Zwei\", the player would only spend about 30% in this fashion within \"Brütal Legend\". This subsequently led to much of the action and combat-driven gameplay outside of the stage battles. In a 2015 interview, Schafer said that much of the gameplay outside of stage battles were to provide tutorials for the Stage Battles, and to make the game more of an action-adventure than an RTS to avoid the stigma that impacts sales of RTS games. This caused the production to expand considerably around the merger of Vivendi-Activision, and Double Fine had difficulties convincing the new publishers to fund the expanded game.\n\nThe team used Unreal Engine 2.5 to build and test prototypes of the real-time strategy elements, allowing the designers and gameplay programmers to commence work while another team focused on creating a new game engine. Having completed the multiplayer stage battle portion of the game first, Double Fine found it easy to gradually introduce the player to its more advanced aspects during the single-player campaign. The game-world's large size and varied content necessitated a game engine with streaming capabilities, allowing the game to seamlessly load and unload content as needed — this was also something the team had no prior experience with. Double Fine developed several in-house tools to help streamline the content-creation process for the game's world: an automated testing bot, RoBert (so named after one of the test engineers), was created to put daily builds of the game through continuous and rigorous testing, automatically reporting any errors to developers, while the Multi-User-Editor allowed the game's artists to simultaneously work on the game-world without fear of overwriting each other's work. The team ran into content management issues late in the game's development as more of the game's assets neared completion. Within the span of a few months the combined asset size tripled, endangering the game's ability to fit on a DVD and causing performance problems throughout the company's development systems. With the help of the engineering team, they were eventually able to overcome the performance issues and re-optimize the content for space.\n\nWith the popularity of the \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" franchises, many wondered if \"Brütal Legend\" would take advantage of these games' guitar-themed controllers. Schafer mentioned that while he had entertained the idea, he could not find an acceptable way for players to repeatedly switch between standard and guitar controllers, so he abandoned it. Players who preordered the game through GameStop were able to unlock a special promotional in-game guitar designed in conjunction with Jack Black's band Tenacious D, and includes voices provided by both Black and Kyle Gass.\n\nWhile \"Brütal Legend\"s fate was unclear, Schafer was not able to talk about the project to avoid causing problems with any potential business deals, until EA Partners picked up the game in December 2008. However, even when the fate of the publication of the game was unsure, the team continued to work on its development. Schafer reflected that the time spent during development without a publisher was beneficial, allowing them to design the game without pressure from the publisher's goals. EA CEO John Riccitiello, when asked about EA picking up \"Brütal Legend\" for distribution prior to December 2008, commented that \"Sometimes significant creative risks end up being some of the world’s best products\".\n\nWhen rumors of a possible Wii port arose in March 2009, Schafer stated that \"We are making an Xbox 360 and a PS3 version of Brütal Legend.\" However, according to Ben Fritz at \"Variety\", another studio has been engaged by Electronic Arts to bring the game to the Wii, albeit at a later date than the other console versions, suggesting that it may follow the same model as \"\", a Wii title scheduled to be released about a year after \"Dead Space\"'s first release. However, further industry rumors, which claimed that the Wii version was being done by Electronic Arts in-house, have stated that the effort to port the game to the Wii has been canceled due to quality and technical concerns.\n\nInitially after its release, Double Fine had not planned on a PC version of the game, as Schafer has stated that the game is primarily an action game and \"meant to be on a console\". However, in February 2013, Double Fine announced that a Windows version of the game will be released on February 26, 2013. The Windows port has been updated for higher resolutions of modern computers, and includes both DLC packs released for consoles. The multiplayer aspects of the PC version include a number of tweaks that Double Fine had tracked that they wanted to have made to the console version but could not do; while the full list of changes are not expected to be present in the initial PC release, Schafer has stated that if sales of the PC version are successful, they will look at adding new units, factions, and gameplay modes that they had originally scoped out for the console version. Mac and Linux ports were released in May 2013, premiering as part of the Humble Double Fine Bundle.\n\nDouble Fine believed they were given the go-ahead to develop a sequel to \"Brütal Legend\" after the game's release, and had invested a great deal of development time towards this, but were later told by EA that it was cancelled. Schafer stated that the sequel would likely incorporate much of what they had to drop prior to the game's release. This game world would have been three times larger than what \"Brütal Legend\" contained. The sequel would have likely included a fourth faction that was cut from the original game which would have been the last major group the player would have to fight through, including a major boss character, before the final battles with Doviculus. Schafer further noted that at the end of the original game, Doviculus' head falls into the Sea of Black Tears, and implied that the same effect that the Sea had on Ophelia could happen to Doviculus. Schafer also had ideas for a plot using a character voiced by Ronnie James Dio, but will not likely be used due to Dio's death.\n\nThe cancellation of the sequel nearly ruined Double Fine, as they had invested all current efforts toward the title. Instead of a sequel, Double Fine began work on four smaller projects, \"Costume Quest\", \"Stacking\", \"Iron Brigade\" (formerly titled \"Trenched\") and \"\", based on prototypes they had created from \"Amnesia Fortnights\" during the development period where they had lacked a publisher. In these two-weeks sessions, the Double Fine team was split into four groups and each tasked with creating a small prototype game to share with the rest of the company; all four mini-games were well received internally. Upon hearing of the cancellation of the sequel, Schafer and his team began to promote these games around, and were able to obtain publishing deals for all four titles. The games will be able to take advantage of the custom game world engine and other assets they had created for \"Brütal Legend\". The titles were considered financial successes, allowing Double Fine to recover and pursue further game development though steering away from major AAA releases.\n\nAs of 2013, Schafer is still interested in a sequel to \"Brütal Legend\", but would require appropriate funding and resources to make it happen as an independent developer. Since then, Double Fine launched a successful crowd-funded drive for \"Psychonauts 2\" in December 2015; Schafer said that if that game does well, there is a good chance that a sequel to \"Brütal Legend\" would be possible. Brutal Legend will eventually get a sequel, Tim Schafer of developer Double Fine said June 13 during an appearance at E3 2017.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" was originally to be published by Vivendi Games' subsidiary Sierra Entertainment. In 2008, Activision merged with Vivendi's game division (which included Blizzard Entertainment) to become Activision Blizzard, gaining the rights to publication of \"Brütal Legend\". Upon evaluation of their assets, Activision Blizzard chose to drop \"Brütal Legend\" along with several other games, leaving the project in limbo. Activision CEO Robert Kotick later claimed the reason for dropping the project was due to: the project running late; missing milestones; overspending the budget and not looking like a good game. Double Fine themselves were unaware that Activision had chosen to drop the game, having been informed through an Activision press release that omitted the game from their upcoming release schedule, according to studio producer Caroline Esmurdoc. Industry rumors suggested that Electronic Arts was interested in publishing the property, and it was confirmed in December 2008 that Electronic Arts would publish the game. During the period when \"Brütal Legend\"s fate was unclear, Schafer was not able to talk about the project to avoid causing problems with any potential business deals.\n\nIn February 2009, Activision Blizzard had asserted that the Electronic Arts deal was invalid, believing that they were still in negotiations with Double Fine to publish the game. It was believed that Activision was seeking monetary compensation in a similar manner as it received from Atari for \"\" and \"\", games that were dropped when Activision Blizzard re-evaluated their assets. On June 4, 2009, Activision filed suit to prevent publishing of the game, claiming that they had invested $15 million in the title and still had a valid contract to release the game. Activision's suit also contends that Double Fine had missed a deadline for the game last year, requesting more time and an additional $7 million in development fees. Activision's considers both the loss of the money they spent on the game as well as potential sales and \"Brütal Legend\"-related merchandise as part of the harm done in the lawsuit.\n\nIn July 2009, Double Fine issued a countersuit against Activision, citing that the latter company had abandoned the project before, and was trying to harm \"Brütal Legend\" during its critical marketing phase, as well as trying to protect its \"Guitar Hero\" franchise. The countersuit stated that Activision had dropped the game after its merger with Vivendi and a failed attempt to convert the game into a \"Guitar Hero\" sequel. Schafer was infamously quoted as saying, in commenting on their actions, \"Hey, if Activision liked it, then they should have put a ring on it. Oh great, now Beyonce is going to sue me too.\"\n\nIn late July, the presiding judge, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan, reported that a preliminary ruling that could have affected the game's release would have been given on August 6, 2009, with Karlan tentatively ready to deny Activision's motion to delay the game. However, prior to the ruling, the companies announced they had reached an out-of-court settlement on the lawsuits, though details were not available.\n\nThough most of the developers involved in the game were shielded from the effects of the lawsuit, Double Fine's Caroline Esmurdoc noted that it took a significant toll on Schafer and the other lead executives at the company. Activision's lawsuit had been filed at the time the game had reached the alpha release state, and would need to be concluded prior to the game's final release; this required the executives to dedicate their time towards information gathering, interviewing, and other legal matters \"during the crunchiest, most critical time of development\". As such, while they ultimately were able to settle the legal matter, Esmurdoc believed that the impact of the effort in settling the lawsuit impacted the quality of the final product. Schafer wrote more than 50% of the game's dialog in the few months following the completion of the lawsuit and prior to release, a \"big crunch\" for him.\n\nSchafer, prior to the game's release, stated that Double Fine had \"something awesome\" planned for downloadable content to further support the game after release. Two downloadable packs have since been released. The first, \"Tears of the Hextadon\", was released in early November 2009, containing two new multiplayer maps and a new single-player weapon. The pack was initially free on the PlayStation Network for the first two weeks of release. The second pack, \"The Hammer of Infinite Fate\", was released in mid-December 2009, and in addition to new multiplayer maps, expands the single-player experience by incorporating new weaponry for the Deuce, outfits for Eddie, a GPS system to track collectibles in the game's world, and other additional content, including figureheads of Razputin, the lead character from \"Psychonauts\", and Schafer himself.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" was officially announced in October 2007 through a feature article in \"Game Informer\"; gaming journalists had received a vinyl record from Activision that contained a backwards message alluding to the game's story. The game's release in October 2009 was promoted as \"Rocktober\" in official literature about the game from Electronic Arts. At the 2009 Download Festival in Donington Park in England, Electronic Arts arranged for 440 fans of \"Brütal Legend\" to help to break the Guinness World Record for the largest number of air guitar players, all simultaneously playing to \"Ace of Spades\" by Motörhead. A series of short online videos featuring Black (and Schafer in two instances), entitled \"Brutal Thoughts with Jack Black\", have been used to promote the game since May 2009. At the 2009 Video Music Awards, Black appeared in cosplay as Eddie to promote the game.\n\nA promotional concert for the game was held at the 2009 Comic-Con International Convention in July 2009, and featured the metal artists Gwar, 3 Inches of Blood, Unholy Pink, and Keith Morris. It has also been announced that Brutal Legend was the official sponsor of the 2009 Mastodon/Dethklok tour. Schafer appeared on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" on October 2, 2009 to promote the game. Black appeared on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on October 14, 2009, dressed as Eddie Riggs and staying in character during his interview.\n\nA demo version of the game was made available on the Xbox 360 Marketplace and PlayStation Network Store; it was available for a limited time on September 17, 2009 for North American users who had pre-ordered the product through GameStop. The demo became available to all Xbox Live Gold users on September 24, 2009, and to Xbox Live Silver users and all PlayStation 3 users the following week. The demo is based on the game's beginning, showing Eddie's arrival and his encounters up until the first boss character fight.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" features 107 heavy metal tracks from 75 different bands, selected by Schafer and Music Director Emily Ridgway as listed below, each song being a \"completely sincere choice\" by Schafer and Ridgway, with the whole track list being \"designed to be loved by Metal fans.\" Schafer sought to include songs from most main subgenres of metal, including classic heavy metal, industrial metal, black metal, and doom metal, with each faction in the game favoring a specific type. Though Schafer and others on the Double Fine team had vast knowledge of specific types of metal, Ridgway turned to a used-CD store owner named Allan from Aquarius Records who had \"encyclopedic knowledge\" of the entire genre, and who provided the team with sample CDs to help them discover some of the more obscure metal bands. Schafer had identified many of the more well-known songs on the list, while Ridgway was able to locate mission-appropriate, more obscure titles for inclusion; for example, one mission, given by the Killmaster (voiced by Lemmy Kilmister), involves rescuing female troops for Ironheade's army; Ridgway had been able to locate a cover of \"Bomber\", originally recorded by Motörhead (Kilmister's band) and performed by the all-female metal band Girlschool, recorded in their 1981 split EP \"St. Valentine's Day Massacre\". Schafer also credits Black with some of the music selections for the game. Instead of relying on labels or bands to provide them with a list of possible songs to select from, the development team sought permission to use specific songs they wanted in the game. In some cases, obtaining appropriate licensing proved difficult, as for songs from bands that had long split up, Double Fine needed to contact each band member to gain permission. This proved to be valuable, as some original bands were excited about their music being used in the game; in one case, Lita Ford was able to provide the game with a song with slight modifications to the lyrics from a version that she was about to release. One song is from the in-game band \"Kabbage Boy\" for which Eddie is a roadie at the start of the game.\n\nSchafer had tried to get music from groups like Metallica and AC/DC, but their licensing fees were too high. He further tried to work with Iron Maiden, but the group was hesitant to participate after recognizing that the character name \"Eddie Riggs\" suggested an attachment with the band's mascot, named \"Eddie\" and designed by Derek Riggs; the band's marketing group pointed out that this could imply that Iron Maiden had endorsed the game.\n\nIn addition to licensed music, the game includes over 70 minutes of original score by Tim Schafer's long term collaborator Peter McConnell. McConnell composed pieces for orchestra and Metal band to tie in with the licensed music in the game. Also, the in-game soundtrack contains an instrumental drum track played by Slough Feg drummer Harry Cantwell, all other \"real\" drums (6 tracks) were played by Y&T drummer Mike Vanderhule and recorded by Jory Prum. The solos triggered by the player during the game were composed and recorded by Judas Priest guitarists Glenn Tipton (Eddie's solos) and K.K. Downing (Ophelia's and Doviculus' solos). While Schafer would like to have a soundtrack album for the game, he stated that there were already difficulties in securing the licenses for songs within the game and was not sure if it would be possible to extend them to a soundtrack. Schafer helped to select three songs—\"We Are The Road Crew\" by Motörhead, \"The Metal\" by Tenacious D, and \"More Than Meets The Eye\" by Testament—to appear in a pack of \"Rock Band\" downloadable songs that was made available the same day as \"Brütal Legend\"'s release.\n\nThe full soundtrack remained intact for \"Brütal Legend\"s addition to the Xbox One backwards comparability catalog in September 2018; Double Fine had assured all music licensing rights had remains in place for this release.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" received positive response from gaming journalists, with reviewers praising the story and characters of the game, and driven vocal performances of the voice actors, particularly Black and Osbourne. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt Black was \"completely committed\" to the role of Riggs, while Giant Bomb's Ryan Davis found it relieving that Black reined in his typical \"loud-talking heavy-metal goofball\" act that he is known for and instead performed well, \"bringing just the right amount of working-man's matter-of-fact-ness to the role\". Osbourne's role was considered \"amazing (and surprisingly coherent)\" by GameSpot's Giancarlo Varanini and \"played brilliantly\" by Computer and Video Games' Andrew Kelly. The full cast was commended for their roles; the heavy metal musicians were effective at playing themselves in the game, while the other voice talent performed well and \"[did] their part to balance out the star power\" in the game. The strength of the characters was considered to be enhanced by the quality of writing of the story, and the use of facial animation. Eurogamer's Christian Donlan considered the characters of \"Brütal Legend\" to be the strongest aspect to the game, distancing the title from other video games due to \"rounded, personable leads who are distinctly superior to the usual throngs of cybermen and super-vixens\", and a facet of Schafer's signature work. \"Wired\"'s Chris Kohler further attested the strength of the game's story to Schafer's skill, considering that \"After \"Brütal Legend\", he should be considered one of the best storytellers in gaming, period.\" 1UP.com's Justin Haywald noted that the game lacks the ability to review cutscenes, forcing the player to restart the story if they wanted to see these again.\n\nThe heavy metal-inspired world of \"Brütal Legend\" was also well received, and considered to show a clear reverence for the genre. Gerald Villoria of GameSpy considered the game to be \"dedicated to an unabashed love of metal\" and \"heavy metal fan-service to the highest degree\". Davis believed that the juxtaposition of all the elements that made up the heavy metal fantasy world were the game's greatest strength, often being \"both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass\" at the same time. Critics found that while the graphics for the game may not be the most sophisticated for the current console generation, the detailed art aspects of the world were impressive; Varanini considered that \"no matter where you are in the world, there's always some cool object to look at\", while Donlan considered the world to be a \"constant unfolding delight\". The incorporation of heavy metal music into the game also benefited the game. Both Kelly and Villoria considered the soundtrack essential to the game, and praised the moments where specific songs, such as Dragonforce's \"Through the Fire and Flames\" would be used as background music during specific game sequences. Kelly further praised the game for using the songs to define the action of the game instead of relegated to random background music. Villoria also considered the soundtrack to have \"enormous breadth of sound and diversity\", introducing the player to heavy metal genres they may not have known even existed. G4TV's Jake Gaskill considered listening to the soundtrack to be the equivalent of \"taking a class in heavy metal appreciation.\"\n\nThe actual gameplay was seen as \"Brütal Legend\" largest weakness. Many reviewers were critical of the incorporation of real-time strategy (RTS) elements into the game, a fact that was not well advertised prior to the game's release and does not become apparent to the player in the first hours of the game. Though Schafer had set out to make the console-based game like an RTS from the start, they were warned by both Vivendi and Electronic Arts that \"RTS\" was \"a naughty word in the console space\", and instead marketed it as an action game. Despite this, reviewers found that the game was still difficult to play on a console due to the selected controls that made it difficult to target objectives or troops, the lack of a mini-map to track friends and foes, and the frantic pace of battle.\n\nCritics did appreciate the slow introduction to the various aspects of the game as part of the single player game, but felt the game did not adequately introduce or explain all of the game's RTS features, such as the ability to mount a final stand on one's stage. Some also considered the single-player campaign Stage Battles to be too easy, winnable by brute force, and that more advanced tactics would only become apparent as one played in multiplayer games, including learning the abilities and advantages of the other units of the factions other than Ironheade. The mix of gaming genres between the RTS and third-person action was found particularly confusing; Kohler commented that the handling of the individual genres was accomplished well, leading to \"an astoundingly complex design instead of a simple one\" that diminished the enjoyment of the game, while Davis considered that \"perhaps there wasn't enough confidence in any one piece to let it carry the whole game\". However, some felt that the various genres helped to create \"a variety of gameplay opportunities\", and made for \"rather elegant\" Stage Battles. In retrospect, Schafer lamented that they did not include enough tutorials in the game to guide the player as to \"naturally how to play the strategy part a bit better\", as they had come to accept over the years of development, and tried to use the Double Fine blog to explain some of these aspects. Though some critics argued that stripping out the RTS elements and leaving an action combat game wrapped in the metal-themed world would have been a better game, Schafer countered that this would have not been true to the vision that he had from the start. Schafer would later jokingly refer to the RTS elements of \"Brütal Legend\"; during the fundraising for \"Broken Age\", Schafer teasingly threatened to add RTS elements to the point-and-click if the funding had reached certain levels.\n\nGameplay outside of the Stage Battles was also met with mixed impressions. Most considered the side missions highly repetitive, which included mission types that are generally disliked by gamers, such as escort missions. The lack of a mini-map, replaced by either following a glowing light from the sky illuminating the player's target or by navigating based on the Deuce's turn signals, was criticized for making it difficult to explore the game's world. The information about the world that players can access in the game's pause menu was also found to be lacking, neither showing the collectible elements of the game on the main map, nor easily identifying the alliance of the various troops in the in-game guidebook. Though Eddie gains the ability to fly during Stage Battles, the inability to use this or to make the character jump led to reviewers getting the character stuck on the landscape at times when exploring. Some reviewers found the number of progress checkpoints in the game to be lacking, requiring the player to repeat a long mission if they should die before reaching one. The single-player game was also considered to be short, lasting as little as four hours if one only completed the main story missions.\nAccording to the NPD Group, \"Brütal Legend\" sold approximately 215,000 copies in the United States in October 2009, with about 150,000 copies being for the Xbox 360 platform, making it the 12th-top-selling game in that month. These numbers were not considered to be strong, and were attributed to the difficult marketing of the game, which emphasized Jack Black's involvement and the heavy metal nature of the game, but did not assert what the gameplay would actually be like, with the possibility that the mention of the RTS elements of the game would have possibly driven more players away from the game. In an interview in February 2011, Schafer claimed that the game had sold over 1.4 million copies. \n\nAccording to data collected through Nielsen SoundScan, some songs contained within \"Brütal Legend\"'s soundtrack saw digital sales increases of up to 700% following the game's release, similar to the effects of \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\", though impact on overall sales of these songs was rather small.\nBlack was given the Best Voice award at the Spike Video Game Awards 2009. \"Brütal Legend\" won the \"Best Strategy/Simulation Game\" and \"Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack\" awards in the 13th-annual Interactive Achievement Awards from the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences, and was nominated for \"Outstanding Character Performance\" (for Eddie Riggs), \"Outstanding Achievement in Original Story\", and \"Outstanding Achievement in Game Direction\". \n\nThe game was also nominated for the Game Developers Choice Awards for \"Best Writing\" and \"Best Audio\".\n\n\n"}

Cadw works to protect the historic buildings and structures, the landscapes and heritage sites of Wales, so that the public can visit them, enjoy them and understand their significance. Cadw manages 127 state owned properties and sites. It arranges events at its managed properties, provides lectures and teaching sessions, offers heritage walks and hosts an online shop. Members of the public can become members of Cadw to gain membership privileges.\n\nAs the Welsh Government's historic environment service, Cadw is charged with protecting the historic environment of Wales, and making it accessible to members of the public. To this end, in 2010–11 it identified four aspects of its work; it would take measures to conserve the heritage of Wales, its ancient buildings and monuments; it aimed to sustain the distinctive characters of the different landscapes and urban areas; it would try to help people understand and care about their country, their locality and its history, and the place of Wales in the world; it aimed to improve the wellbeing of people in Wales.\n\nCadw is responsible for the care and upkeep of three World Heritage Sites in Wales: the Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and the Blaenavon Industrial Landscape.\n\nMany of these listed sites are in private ownership, but Cadw has a specific responsibility for the care and upkeep of the 127 historic sites that are in state ownership. Many of Wales' great castles and other monuments, such as bishop's palaces, historic houses, and ruined abbeys, are protected and maintained in this way, as well being opened to the public. Cadw has been appointed by the Welsh Government and is the successor body in Wales to the Ministry of Works.\n\nCadw also identifies (and develops to criteria for identification) of historical assets in Wales. In 2011 there were 29,936 listed buildings in Wales ; of these, 493 were the most important Grade I listed buildings, 2,124 were Grade II* and 27,319 were Grade II listed. Most of these were in private ownership. Also in Wales were 4,175 Scheduled Monuments, 6 Designated historic wrecks, and 523 Conservation Areas; these designations means that the buildings or objects concerned are protected by statute. A register of significant Welsh battlefield sites is also under preparation.\n\nThere are 58 Historic Landscapes and 376 Historic parks and gardens in Wales. Cadw is also undertaking urban character studies of urban areas. Eight had been completed by September 2013. Combined with a register of buildings and ancient monuments at risk these aim to enable management decision making and grant allocation to strengthen the character of different areas.\n\nCadw operates most of the heritage sites in its care and opens them to the public. In 2010–11 there were an estimated 2 million visits to Cadw properties. In some cases, these are major tourist attractions and offer tours of the monuments, exhibitions and display panels. Cadw also produces books and guidebooks on many of their properties. However many of the sites are unstaffed, free to access, and have interpretation boards to explain their significance. Alongside this, a mobile app was released in 2016, which provides basic information for visitors as well as an interpretative aspect for larger sites.\n\nThe five most frequently visited properties in 2010-11 were Caernarfon Castle (192,695 visits), Conwy Castle (190,031 visits), Caerphilly Castle (94,707 visits), Harlech Castle (93,242 visits) and Beaumaris Castle (80,660 visits).\n\nTo provide a better context for the history of Wales, in 2010–11 Cadw was developing thematic 'All Wales Interpretation Plans', that could develop themes across numerous sites and localities. There were eight themes:-\n\nCadw Membership, formerly known as Heritage in Wales, gives the member free admission to all Cadw properties and World Heritage Sites in Wales for the length of their membership (annual or life). Other membership advantages are a free magazine, reduced prices at the online gift shop and free entry to most Cadw-organised events. Cadw has also entered into reciprocal agreements with English Heritage, Historic Scotland and Manx National Heritage for free entry to the properties they manage.\n\nCadw organises events for adults and families. These include lectures, re-enactments of historical events, and training sessions for teachers, informing them on how to use visits to historic sites to help deliver literacy and numeracy skills and an appreciation of history.\n\nHistorical and cultural events are one of the ways people are encouraged to engage more thoroughly with the places and history of Cadw properties, and some 200 events a year are held. Cadw also provides work experience opportunities for young people, and sandwich courses for undergraduates.\n\nEquivalent organisations in other parts of the United Kingdom are: \n\n\n"}
{"id": "57070052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57070052", "title": "California effect", "text": "California effect\n\nThe \"California effect\" is the shift of consumer, environmental and other regulations in the direction of political jurisdictions with stricter regulatory standards. The name is derived from the spread of some advanced environmental regulatory standards that were originally adopted by the U.S. state of California and eventually adopted in other states. This spread is supported by large corporations, which stand to gain as they have the resources necessary to deal with the regulations, unlike their smaller competitors. This process is the opposite of the Delaware effect; this is simply the race to the bottom in which different countries (or states in the case of Delaware) are simply reducing their regulatory burden to attract more of the businesses into their jurisdiction. The assumption behind the Delaware effect is that in the competitive regulatory environment, governments have to remove their regulatory barriers to allow easier functioning of their corporations and to attract new companies to establish their business.\n\nWhile additional regulation can prove to be a burden for any corporation, higher regulatory standards can be a solution to certain externalities which are decreasing the total public good.\n\nThis term is mostly associated with David Vogel who called this phenomenon the \"California effect\".\n\nThe actual existence of this effect in the real world is disputed. While there is large discussion on the possible race to the bottom among countries competing for attention of internationally mobile capital, there seems to be some limited evidence that at least in some sectors the California effect can be observed.\n"}

{"id": "41377468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41377468", "title": "Culture of New England", "text": "Culture of New England\n\nThe culture of New England comprises a shared heritage and culture primarily shaped by its indigenous peoples, early English colonists, and waves of immigration from Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. In contrast to other American regions, many of New England's earliest Puritan settlers came from eastern England, contributing to New England's distinctive accents, foods, customs, and social structures.\n\nNew England is the oldest region of the United States and one of the first successful English settlements in the Americas, and it has a long and oft-contested cultural history. Professor of American and New England Studies Joseph A. Conforti writes, \"New England has been a storied place. Its identity has been encoded in narratives about its past—stories that have been continually revised in response to new interpretive needs generated by the transformations of regional life[, helping] New Englanders negotiate, traditionalize, and resist change.\" As such, New England culture is a complex combination of its overarching and popular Puritan English colonial narrative and its multiple and equally important complementary and competing alternative narratives.\n\nWithin modern New England, a cultural divide also exists between urban, mobile New Englanders living along the densely populated coastline, and in much of Connecticut, and rural New Englanders in western Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine, where population density is low.\n\nThe creative economy also plays an important role in the larger economy of New England. In 2002, there were nearly 275,000 workers in the region engaged in cultural enterprises, with nearly half in Massachusetts alone. As a percentage of the workforce compared to other US states, Massachusetts ranks first for architects, Connecticut ranks third for producers and directors, Maine ranks fourth for visual artists, New Hampshire ranks eleventh for writers, Rhode Island ranks first for photographers, and Vermont ranks third for visual artists, announcers, and writers.\n\nHistorian Samuel Eliot Morison uses the metaphor of wine to describe the relationship between present New England culture and its past:\n\nMany of the first European colonists of New England had a maritime orientation toward whaling (first noted about 1650) and fishing, in addition to farming. New England has developed a distinct cuisine, dialect, architecture, and government. New England cuisine has a reputation for its emphasis on seafood and dairy; clam chowder, lobster, and other products of the sea are among some of the region's most popular foods.\n\nToday, New England is the least religious part of the U.S. In 2009, less than half of those polled in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont claimed that religion was an important part of their daily lives. Southernmost New England in Connecticut is among the ten least religious states, 53 percent, of those polled claimed that it was. According to the American Religious Identification Survey, 34 percent of Vermonters, a plurality, claimed to have no religion; on average, nearly one out of every four New Englanders identifies as having no religion, more than in any other part of the U.S. New England has one of the highest percentages of Catholics in the U.S. This number declined from 50% in 1990 to 36% in 2008.\n\nThe literature of New England has had an enduring influence on American literature in general, with themes such as religion, race, the individual versus society, social repression, and nature, emblematic of the larger concerns of American letters.\n\nNew England has been the birthplace of American authors and poets. Ralph Waldo Emerson was born in Boston. Henry David Thoreau was born in Concord, Massachusetts, where he famously lived, for some time, by Walden Pond, on Emerson's land. Nathaniel Hawthorne, romantic era writer, was born in historical Salem; later, he would live in Concord at the same time as Emerson and Thoreau. All three of these writers have strong connections to The Old Manse, a home in the Emerson family and a key center of the Transcendentalist movement. Emily Dickinson lived most of her life in Amherst, Massachusetts. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow was from Portland, Maine, and Edgar Allan Poe was born in Boston.\n\nAccording to reports, the famed Mother Goose, the author of fairy tales and nursery rhymes was originally a person named Elizabeth Foster Goose or Mary Goose who lived in Boston. Poets James Russell Lowell, Amy Lowell, and Robert Lowell, a Confessionalist poet and teacher of Sylvia Plath, were all New England natives. Anne Sexton, also taught by Lowell, was born and died in Massachusetts. Much of the work of Nobel Prize laureate Eugene O'Neill is associated with the city of New London, Connecticut where he spent many summers. The 14th U.S. Poet Laureate Donald Hall, a New Hampshire resident, continues the line of renowned New England poets. Noah Webster, the Father of American Scholarship and Education, was born in West Hartford, Connecticut. Pulitzer Prize winning poets Edwin Arlington Robinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Robert P. T. Coffin were born in Maine.\n\nPoets Stanley Kunitz and Elizabeth Bishop were both born in Worcester, Massachusetts, and Pulitzer Prize–winning poet Galway Kinnell was born in Providence, Rhode Island. Oliver La Farge, a New Englander of French and Narragansett descent, won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel, the predecessor to the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, in 1930 for his book Laughing Boy. John P. Marquand grew up in Newburyport, Massachusetts. Novelist Edwin O'Connor, who was also known as a radio personality and journalist, won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel The Edge of Sadness. Pulitzer Prize winner John Cheever, a novelist and short story writer, was born in Quincy, Massachusetts and set most of his fiction in old New England villages based on various South Shore towns around there. E. Annie Proulx was born in Norwich, Connecticut. David Lindsay-Abaire, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 2007 for his play Rabbit Hole, was raised in Boston.\n\n\"Ethan Frome\", written in 1911 by Edith Wharton, is set in turn-of-the-century New England, in the fictitious town of Starkfield, Massachusetts. Like much literature of the region, it plays off themes of isolation and hopelessness. New England is also the setting for most of the gothic horror stories of H. P. Lovecraft, who lived his life in Providence, Rhode Island. Real New England towns such as Ipswich, Newburyport, Rowley, and Marblehead featured often in his stories alongside fictional locations such as Dunwich, Arkham, Innsmouth and Kingsport. Lovecraft often expressed an appreciation for New England in his personal correspondence, and believed that returning to the area was the reason that his writing improved after he left New York City.\n\nJack Kerouac, pioneer of the Beat Generation and author of the 1957 novel On the Road was born in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1922 and was later also buried there after his death in 1969.\nThe region has also drawn authors and poets from other parts of the U.S. Mark Twain thought Hartford was the most beautiful city in the U.S. He made it his home, and wrote his masterpieces there. He lived next door to Harriett Beecher Stowe, a local most famous for the novel \"Uncle Tom's Cabin\". John Updike, originally from Pennsylvania, eventually moved to Ipswich, Massachusetts, which served as the model for the fictional New England town of Tarbox in his 1968 novel \"Couples\". Robert Frost was born in California, but moved to Massachusetts during his teen years and published his first poem in Lawrence; his frequent use of New England settings and themes ensured that he would be associated with the region. Arthur Miller, a New York City native, used New England as the setting for some of his works, most notably \"The Crucible\".\n\nHerman Melville, originally from New York City, bought the house now known as Arrowhead in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and there wrote his greatest novel \"Moby-Dick\". Poet Maxine Kumin was born in Philadelphia, and currently resides in Warner, New Hampshire. Pulitzer Prize–winning poet Mary Oliver was born in Maple Heights, Ohio, and has lived in Provincetown, Massachusetts for the last forty years. Charles Simic, who was born in Belgrade, Serbia (at that time Yugoslavia) grew up in Chicago and lives in Strafford, New Hampshire, on the shore of Bow Lake. He is the professor emeritus of American literature and creative writing at the University of New Hampshire. Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist and short story writer Steven Millhauser, whose short story \"Eisenheim the Illusionist\" was adapted into the 2006 film \"The Illusionist\", was born in New York City and raised in Connecticut.\n\nMore recently, Stephen King, born in Portland, Maine, has used the small towns of his home state as the setting for much of his horror fiction, with several of his stories taking place in or near the fictional town of Castle Rock. Just to the south, Exeter, New Hampshire was the birthplace of best-selling novelist John Irving and Dan Brown, author of \"The Da Vinci Code\". Rick Moody has set many of his works in southern New England, focusing on wealthy families of suburban Connecticut's Gold Coast and their battles with addiction and anomie.\n\nDerek Walcott, a playwright and poet who won the 1992 Nobel Prize for Literature, taught poetry at Boston University. Pulitzer Prize winner Cormac McCarthy, whose novel \"No Country for Old Men\" was made into the Academy Award for Best Picture winning film in 2007, was born in Providence, although he moved to Tennessee when he was a boy. New York Times Bestselling author Dennis Lehane, another native of the Boston area, who was born in Dorchester, wrote the novels that were adapted into the films \"Mystic River\", \"Gone Baby Gone\" and \"Shutter Island\".\n\nLargely on the strength of its local writers, Boston was for some years the center of the U.S. publishing industry, before being overtaken by New York in the middle of the nineteenth century. Boston remains the home of publishers Houghton Mifflin and Pearson Education, and was the longtime home of literary magazine \"The Atlantic Monthly\". Merriam-Webster is based in Springfield, Massachusetts. \"Yankee\", a magazine for New Englanders, is based in Dublin, New Hampshire.\n\nThere are several American English accents spoken in the region including New England English and Boston Accent.\n\nThe New England English dialect and Boston accent are native to the region. Many of its most stereotypical features (such as r dropping and the so-called broad A) are believed to have originated in Boston from the influence of England's Received Pronunciation, which shares those features. While some Boston accents are most strongly associated with the so-called \"Eastern Establishment\" and Boston's upper class, the common accent is locally prevalent and predominantly associated with blue-collar natives exemplified by movies like \"Good Will Hunting\" and \"The Departed\". The Boston accent and accents closely related to it cover eastern Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine.\n\nSome Rhode Islanders speak with a non-rhotic accent that many compare to a \"Brooklyn\" or a cross between a New York and Boston accent (\"water\" becomes \"wata\"). Many Rhode Islanders distinguish the \"aw\" sound , as one might hear in New Jersey; e.g., the word \"coffee\" is pronounced . This type of accent was brought to the region by early settlers from eastern England in the Puritan migration in the mid-seventeenth century.\n\nIn much of rural northern New England, particularly Maine, Acadian and Québécois culture are included in music and dance. Contra dancing and country square dancing are popular throughout New England, usually backed by live Irish, Acadian, or other folk music.\nTraditional knitting, quilting and rug hooking circles in rural New England have become less common; church, sports, and town government are more typical social activities. These traditional gatherings are often hosted in individual homes or civic centers; larger groups regularly assemble at special-purpose ice cream parlors that dot the countryside. New England leads the U.S. in ice cream consumption per capita.\n\nIn the U.S., candlepin bowling is essentially confined to New England, where it was invented in the 19th century. Basketball was invented in Springfield, Massachusetts, and volleyball was invented in Holyoke, Massachusetts.\n\nNew England was for some time an important center of American classical music. The Second New England School was instrumental in reinvigorating the tradition in the U.S. Prominent modernist composers also come from the region, including Charles Ives and John Adams. Boston is the site of the New England Conservatory and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The Yale School of Music in New Haven, CT is another renowned institution.\n\nIn rock music, the region has produced bands as different as Aerosmith, Phish, the Pixies, and Boston. Dick Dale, a Quincy, Massachusetts native, helped popularize surf rock. The region has also become a hotbed for Hardcore Punk and Heavy Metal music (especially with regards to Metalcore and Deathcore).\n\nThe leading U.S. cable TV sports broadcaster ESPN is headquartered in Bristol, Connecticut. New England has several regional cable networks, including New England Cable News (NECN) and the New England Sports Network (NESN). New England Cable News is the largest regional 24-hour cable news network in the U.S., broadcasting to more than 3.2 million homes in all of the New England states. Its studios are located in Newton, Massachusetts, outside of Boston, and it maintains bureaus in Manchester, New Hampshire; Hartford, Connecticut; Worcester, Massachusetts; Portland, Maine; and Burlington, Vermont. In much of Connecticut, including Litchfield, Fairfield, and New Haven counties it also broadcasts New York based news programs—this is due in part to the immense influence New York has on southern Connecticut's economy and culture. Many areas in southern Connecticut often listen to NYC based radio stations as well as local stations.\n\nNESN broadcasts the Boston Red Sox baseball and Boston Bruins hockey throughout the region, except for southern Connecticut. Most of Connecticut, save for Windham county in the state's northeast corner, and even southern Rhode Island, receives the YES Network, which broadcasts the games of the New York Yankees. For the most part, the same areas also carry SportsNet New York (SNY), which broadcasts New York Mets games. Central Connecticut appears to be the rough line where fans root for New England/Boston teams and NYC based sports teams.\n\nComcast SportsNet New England broadcasts the games of the Boston Celtics, New England Revolution and Boston Cannons.\n\nWhile most New England cities have daily newspapers, \"The Boston Globe\" and \"The New York Times\" are distributed widely throughout the region. Major newspapers also include \"The Providence Journal\", \"Portland Press Herald\", and \"Hartford Courant\", the oldest continuously published newspaper in the U.S.\n\nNew Englanders are well represented in American comedy. Writers for \"The Simpsons\" and late-night television programs often come by way of the Harvard Lampoon. \"Family Guy\", an animated sitcom situated in Rhode Island, as well as \"American Dad!\" and \"The Cleveland Show\", were created by Connecticut native and Rhode Island School of Design graduate Seth MacFarlane. A number of \"Saturday Night Live\" (SNL) cast members have origins in New England, from Adam Sandler to Amy Poehler, who also stars in the NBC television series \"Parks and Recreation\". Former \"Daily Show\" correspondents Rob Corddry and Steve Carell are from Massachusetts, with the latter also being involved in film and the American adaptation of \"The Office\". The American \"Office\" also featured Dunder-Mifflin branches set in Stamford, Connecticut and Nashua, New Hampshire.\n\nLate-night television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien have origins in the Boston area. Notable stand-up comedians, including Dane Cook, Steve Sweeney, Steven Wright, Sarah Silverman, Lisa Lampanelli, Denis Leary, Lenny Clarke, and Louis CK, are also from the region. \"SNL\" cast member Seth Meyers once attributed the region's imprint on American humor to its \"sort of wry New England sense of pointing out anyone who's trying to make a big deal of himself\", with the \"Boston Globe\" suggesting that irony and sarcasm, as well as Irish influences, are its trademarks.\n"}

{"id": "60125", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60125", "title": "Engraving", "text": "Engraving\n\nEngraving is the practice of incising a design onto a hard, usually flat surface by cutting grooves into it with a burin. The result may be a decorated object in itself, as when silver, gold, steel, or glass are engraved, or may provide an intaglio printing plate, of copper or another metal, for printing images on paper as prints or illustrations; these images are also called \"engravings\". Engraving is one of the oldest and most important techniques in printmaking. Wood engraving is a form of relief printing and is not covered in this article.\n\nEngraving was a historically important method of producing images on paper in artistic printmaking, in mapmaking, and also for commercial reproductions and illustrations for books and magazines. It has long been replaced by various photographic processes in its commercial applications and, partly because of the difficulty of learning the technique, is much less common in printmaking, where it has been largely replaced by etching and other techniques.\n\n\"Engraving\" is also loosely but incorrectly used for any old black and white print; it requires a degree of expertise to distinguish engravings from prints using other techniques such as etching in particular, but also mezzotint and other techniques. Many old master prints also combine techniques on the same plate, further confusing matters. Line engraving and steel engraving cover use for reproductive prints, illustrations in books and magazines, and similar uses, mostly in the 19th century, and often not actually using engraving.\n\nTraditional engraving, by burin or with the use of machines, continues to be practised by goldsmiths, glass engravers, gunsmiths and others, while modern industrial techniques such as photoengraving and laser engraving have many important applications. Engraved gems were an important art in the ancient world, revived at the Renaissance, although the term traditionally covers relief as well as intaglio carvings, and is essentially a branch of sculpture rather than engraving, as drills were the usual tools.\n\nOther terms often used for printed engravings are copper engraving, copper-plate engraving or \"line engraving\". Steel engraving is the same technique, on steel or steel-faced plates, and was mostly used for banknotes, illustrations for books, magazines and reproductive prints, letterheads and similar uses from about 1790 to the early 20th century, when the technique became less popular, except for banknotes and other forms of security printing. Especially in the past, \"engraving\" was often used very loosely to cover several printmaking techniques, so that many so-called engravings were in fact produced by totally different techniques, such as etching or mezzotint. \"Hand engraving\" is a term sometimes used for engraving objects other than printing plates, to inscribe or decorate jewellery, firearms, trophies, knives and other fine metal goods. Traditional engravings in printmaking are also \"hand engraved\", using just the same techniques to make the lines in the plate.\n\nEach graver is different and has its own use. Engravers use a hardened steel tool called a burin, or graver, to cut the design into the surface, most traditionally a copper plate. However, modern hand engraving artists use burins or gravers to cut a variety of metals such as silver, nickel, steel, brass, gold, titanium, and more, in applications from weaponry to jewellery to motorcycles to found objects. Modern professional engravers can engrave with a resolution of up to 40 lines per mm in high grade work creating game scenes and scrollwork. Dies used in mass production of molded parts are sometimes hand engraved to add special touches or certain information such as part numbers.\n\nIn addition to hand engraving, there are engraving machines that require less human finesse and are not directly controlled by hand. They are usually used for lettering, using a pantographic system. There are versions for the insides of rings and also the outsides of larger pieces. Such machines are commonly used for inscriptions on rings, lockets and presentation pieces.\n\nGravers come in a variety of shapes and sizes that yield different line types. The burin produces a unique and recognizable quality of line that is characterized by its steady, deliberate appearance and clean edges. The angle tint tool has a slightly curved tip that is commonly used in printmaking. Florentine liners are flat-bottomed tools with multiple lines incised into them, used to do fill work on larger areas or to create uniform shade lines that are fast to execute. Ring gravers are made with particular shapes that are used by jewelry engravers in order to cut inscriptions inside rings. Flat gravers are used for fill work on letters, as well as \"wriggle\" cuts on most musical instrument engraving work, remove background, or create bright cuts. Knife gravers are for line engraving and very deep cuts. Round gravers, and flat gravers with a radius, are commonly used on silver to create bright cuts (also called bright-cut engraving), as well as other hard-to-cut metals such as nickel and steel. Square or V-point gravers are typically square or elongated diamond-shaped and used for cutting straight lines. V-point can be anywhere from 60 to 130 degrees, depending on purpose and effect. These gravers have very small cutting points. Other tools such as mezzotint rockers, roulets and burnishers are used for texturing effects. Burnishing tools can also be used for certain stone setting techniques.\n\nMusical instrument engraving on American-made brass instruments flourished in the 1920s and utilizes a specialized engraving technique where a flat graver is \"walked\" across the surface of the instrument to make zig-zag lines and patterns. The method for \"walking\" the graver may also be referred to as \"wriggle\" or \"wiggle\" cuts. This technique is necessary due to the thinness of metal used to make musical instruments versus firearms or jewelry. Wriggle cuts are commonly found on silver Western jewelry and other Western metal work.\n\nTool geometry is extremely important for accuracy in hand engraving. When sharpened for most applications, a graver has a \"face\", which is the top of the graver, and a \"heel\", which is the bottom of the graver; not all tools or application require a heel. These two surfaces meet to form a point that cuts the metal. The geometry and length of the heel helps to guide the graver smoothly as it cuts the surface of the metal. When the tool's point breaks or chips, even on a microscopic level, the graver can become hard to control and produces unexpected results. Modern innovations have brought about new types of carbide that resist chipping and breakage, which hold a very sharp point longer between resharpening than traditional metal tools.\n\nSharpening a graver or burin requires either a sharpening stone or wheel. Harder carbide and steel gravers require diamond-grade sharpening wheels; these gravers can be polished to a mirror finish using a ceramic or cast iron lap, which is essential in creating bright cuts. Several low-speed, reversible sharpening system made specifically for hand engravers are available that reduce sharpening time. Fixtures that secure the tool in place at certain angles and geometries are also available to take the guesswork from sharpening to produce accurate points. Very few master engravers exist today who rely solely on \"feel\" and muscle memory to sharpen tools. These master engravers typically worked for many years as an apprentice, most often learning techniques decades before modern machinery was available for hand engravers. These engravers typically trained in such countries as Italy and Belgium, where hand engraving has a rich and long heritage of masters.\n\nDesign or artwork is generally prepared in advance, although some professional and highly experienced hand engravers are able to draw out minimal outlines either on paper or directly on the metal surface just prior to engraving. The work to be engraved may be lightly scribed on the surface with a sharp point, laser marked, drawn with a fine permanent marker (removable with acetone) or pencil, transferred using various chemicals in conjunction with inkjet or laser printouts, or stippled. Engraving artists may rely on hand drawing skills, copyright-free designs and images, computer-generated artwork, or common design elements when creating artwork.\n\nOriginally, handpieces varied little in design as the common use was to push with the handle placed firmly in the center of the palm. With modern pneumatic engraving systems, handpieces are designed and created in a variety of shapes and power ranges. Handpieces are made using various methods and materials. Knobs may be handmade from wood, molded and engineered from plastic, or machine-made from brass, steel, or other metals. The most widely known hand engraving tool maker, GRS Tools in Kansas is an American-owned and operated company that manufacture handpieces as well as many other tools for various applications in metal engraving.\n\nThe actual engraving is traditionally done by a combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional \"hand push\" process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air is actuated by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the \"hand push\" effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.\n\nHand engraving artists today employ a combination of hand push, pneumatic, rotary, or hammer and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create \"bulino\" style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.\n\nFinishing the work is often necessary when working in metal that may rust or where a colored finish is desirable, such as a firearm. A variety of spray lacquers and finishing techniques exist to seal and protect the work from exposure to the elements and time. Finishing also may include lightly sanding the surface to remove small chips of metal called \"burrs\" that are very sharp and unsightly. Some engravers prefer high contrast to the work or design, using black paints or inks to darken removed (and lower) areas of exposed metal. The excess paint or ink is wiped away and allowed to dry before lacquering or sealing, which may or may not be desired by the artist.\n\nBecause of the high level of microscopic detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, counterfeiting of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern banknotes are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers. The engraving is so fine that a normal printer cannot recreate the detail of hand engraved images, nor can it be scanned. In the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, more than one hand engraver will work on the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.\n\nThe modern discipline of hand engraving, as it is called in a metalworking context, survives largely in a few specialized fields. The highest levels of the art are found on firearms and other metal weaponry, jewellery, and musical instruments.\n\nIn most commercial markets today, hand engraving has been replaced with milling using CNC engraving or milling machines. Still, there are certain applications where use of hand engraving tools cannot be replaced.\n\nIn some instances, images or designs can be transferred to metal surfaces via mechanical process. One such process is roll stamping or roller-die engraving. In this process, a hardened image die is pressed against the destination surface using extreme pressure to impart the image. In the 1800s pistol cylinders were often decorated via this process to impart a continuous scene around its surface.\n\nEngraving machines such as the K500 (packaging) or K6 (publication) by Hell Gravure Systems use a diamond stylus to cut cells. Each cell creates one printing dot later in the process. A K6 can have up to 18 engraving heads each cutting 8.000 cells per second to an accuracy of .1 µm and below. They are fully computer-controlled and the whole process of cylinder-making is fully automated.\n\nIt is now common place for retail stores (mostly jewellery, silverware or award stores) to have a small computer controlled engrave on site. This enables them to personalise the products they sell. Retail engraving machines tend to be focused around ease of use for the operator and the ability to do a wide variety of items including flat metal plates, jewelry of different shapes and sizes, as well as cylindrical items such as mugs and tankards. They will typically be equipped with a computer dedicated to graphic design that will enable the operator to easily design a text or picture graphic which the software will translate into digital signals telling the engraver machine what to do. Unlike industrial engravers, retail machines are smaller and only use one diamond head. This is interchangeable so the operator can use differently shaped diamonds for different finishing effects. They will typically be able to do a variety of metals and plastics. Glass and crystal engraving is possible, but the brittle nature of the material makes the process more time consuming.\n\nRetail engravers mainly use two different processes. The first and most common 'Diamond Drag' pushes the diamond cutter through the surface of the material and then pulls to create scratches. These direction and depth are controlled by the computer input. The second is 'Spindle Cutter'. This is similar to Diamond Drag, but the engraving head is shaped in a flat V shape, with a small diamond and the base. The machine uses an electronic spindle to quickly rotate the head as it pushes it into the material, then pulls it along whilst it continues to spin. This creates a much bolder impression than diamond drag. It is used mainly for brass plaques and pet tags.\n\nWith state-of-the-art machinery it is easy to have a simple, single item complete in under ten minutes.\nThe engraving process with diamonds is state-of-the-art since the 1960s.\n\nToday laser engraving machines are in development but still mechanical cutting has proven its strength in economical terms and quality. More than 4,000 engravers make approx. 8 Mio printing cylinders worldwide per year.\n\n\"For the printing process, see intaglio (printmaking). For the Western art history of engraved prints, see old master print and line engraving\"\n\nThe first evidence for humans engraving patterns is a chiselled shell, dating back between 540,000 and 430,000 years, from Trinil, in Java, Indonesia, where the first Homo erectus was discovered. Hatched banding upon ostrich eggshells used as water containers found in South Africa in the Diepkloof Rock Shelter and dated to the Middle Stone Age around 60,000 BC are the next documented case of human engraving. Engraving on bone and ivory is an important technique for the Art of the Upper Paleolithic, and larger engraved petroglyphs on rocks are found from many prehistoric periods and cultures around the world.\n\nIn antiquity, the only engraving on metal that could be carried out is the shallow grooves found in some jewellery after the beginning of the 1st Millennium B.C. The majority of so-called engraved designs on ancient gold rings or other items were produced by chasing or sometimes a combination of lost-wax casting and chasing. Engraved gem is a term for any carved or engraved semi-precious stone; this was an important small-scale art form in the ancient world, and remained popular until the 19th century.\n\nHowever the use of glass engraving, usually using a wheel, to cut decorative scenes or figures into glass vessels, in imitation of hardstone carvings, appears as early as the first century AD, continuing into the fourth century CE at urban centers such as Cologne and Rome, and appears to have ceased sometime in the fifth century. Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament. It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and it seems likely that the engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.\n\nIn the European Middle Ages goldsmiths used engraving to decorate and inscribe metalwork. It is thought that they began to print impressions of their designs to record them. From this grew the engraving of copper printing plates to produce artistic images on paper, known as old master prints, in Germany in the 1430s. Italy soon followed. Many early engravers came from a goldsmithing background. The first and greatest period of the engraving was from about 1470 to 1530, with such masters as Martin Schongauer, Albrecht Dürer, and Lucas van Leiden.\nThereafter engraving tended to lose ground to etching, which was a much easier technique for the artist to learn. But many prints combined the two techniques: although Rembrandt's prints are generally all called etchings for convenience, many of them have some burin or drypoint work, and some have nothing else. By the nineteenth century, most engraving was for commercial illustration.\n\nBefore the advent of photography, engraving was used to reproduce other forms of art, for example paintings. Engravings continued to be common in newspapers and many books into the early 20th century, as they were cheaper to use in printing than photographic images.\n\nMany classic postage stamps were engraved, although the practice is now mostly confined to particular countries, or used when a more \"elegant\" design is desired and a limited color range is acceptable.\nModifying the relief designs on coins is a craft dating back to the 18th century and today modified coins are known colloquially as hobo nickels. In the United States, especially during the Great Depression, coin engraving on the large-faced Indian Head nickel became a way to help make ends meet. The craft continues today, and with modern equipment often produces stunning miniuture sculptural artworks and floral scrollwork.\n\nDuring the mid-20th century, a renaissance in hand-engraving began to take place. With the inventions of pneumatic hand-engraving systems that aided hand-engravers, the art and techniques of hand-engraving became more accessible. \n\nThe first music printed from engraved plates dates from 1446 and most printed music was produced through engraving from roughly 1700–1860. From 1860–1990 most printed music was produced through a combination of engraved master plates reproduced through offset lithography.\n\nThe first comprehensive account is given by Mme Delusse in her article \"Gravure en lettres, en géographie et en musique\" in Diderot's Encyclopedia. The technique involved a five-pointed raster to score staff lines, various punches in the shapes of notes and standard musical symbols, and various burins and scorers for lines and slurs. For correction, the plate was held on a bench by callipers, hit with a dot punch on the opposite side, and burnished to remove any signs of the defective work. The process involved intensive pre-planning of the layout, and many manuscript scores with engraver's planning marks survive from the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nBy 1837 pewter had replaced copper as a medium, and Berthiaud gives an account with an entire chapter devoted to music (\"Novel manuel complet de l'imprimeur en taille douce\", 1837). Printing from such plates required a separate inking to be carried out cold, and the printing press used less pressure. Generally, four pages of music were engraved on a single plate. Because music engraving houses trained engravers through years of apprenticeship, very little is known about the practice. Fewer than one dozen sets of tools survive in libraries and museums. By 1900 music engravers were established in several hundred cities in the world, but the art of storing plates was usually concentrated with publishers. Extensive bombing of Leipzig in 1944, the home of most German engraving and printing firms, destroyed roughly half the world's engraved music plates.\n\nExamples of contemporary uses for engraving include creating text on jewellery, such as pendants or on the inside of engagement- and wedding rings to include text such as the name of the partner, or adding a winner's name to a sports trophy. Another application of modern engraving is found in the printing industry. There, every day thousands of pages are mechanically engraved onto rotogravure cylinders, typically a steel base with a copper layer of about 0.1 mm in which the image is transferred. After engraving the image is protected with an approximately 6 µm chrome layer. Using this process the image will survive for over a million copies in high speed printing presses. Engraving machines such as GUN BOW (one of the leading engraving brands) are the best examples of hand engraving tools, although this type of machine is typically not used for fine hand engraving.\nSome schools throughout the world are renowned for their teaching of engraving, like the École Estienne in Paris.\n\nIn traditional engraving, which is a purely linear medium, the impression of half-tones was created by making many very thin parallel lines, a technique called hatching. When two sets of parallel-line \"hatchings\" intersected each other for higher density, the resulting pattern was known as \"cross-hatching\". Patterns of dots were also used in a technique called stippling, first used around 1505 by Giulio Campagnola. Claude Mellan was one of many 17th-century engravers with a very well-developed technique of using parallel lines of varying thickness (known as the \"swelling line\") to give subtle effects of tone (as was Goltzius) – see picture below. One famous example is his \"Sudarium of Saint Veronica\" (1649), an engraving of the face of Jesus made from a single spiraling line that starts at the tip of Jesus's nose.\n\nThe earliest allusion to engraving in the Bible may be the reference to Judah's seal ring (Ge 38:18), followed by (Ex 39.30). Engraving was commonly done with pointed tools of iron or even with diamond points. (Jer 17:1).\n\nEach of the two onyx stones on the shoulder-pieces of the high priest’s ephod was engraved with the names of six different tribes of Israel, and each of the 12 precious stones that adorned his breastpiece was engraved with the name of one of the tribes. The holy sign of dedication, the shining gold plate on the high priest's turban, was engraved with the words: \"Holiness belongs to Adonai.\" Bezalel, along with Oholiab, was qualified to do this specialized engraving work as well as to train others.—Ex 35:30–35; 28:9–12; 39:6–14, 30.\n\nPrints:\n\nOf gems:\n\nOf guns:\n\nOf coins:\n\nOf postage stamps:\n\nOf pins:\n\n\n"}

It is located at one end of Long Lane (\"ulica Długa\"; ), where, together with Brama Wyżynna (German: \"Hohes Tor\" = High Gate) and Wieża Więzienna (German: \"Stockturm\" = Prison Tower), it forms a part of the old city fortifications.\n\nIt was designed by architect Abraham van den Blocke and was built by Jan Strakowski. The architectural style of the gate is Dutch mannerism. Next to it is the late-gothic building of the Brotherhood of St.George.\n\nBoth sides of the gate have attiques, with figures symbolizing the qualities of the ideal citizen. They were designed in 1648 by Jeremias Falck (\"Polonus\"), and reconstructed in 1878 due to the originals being damaged by weathering over time.\n\nFrom the West side they represent (in Latin): \"Pax\" (Peace), \"Libertas\" (Freedom), \"Fortuna\" (Wealth) and \"Fama\" (Fame). From the East (Long Lane) side they are \"Concordia\" (Agreement), \"Iustitia\" (Justice), \"Pietas\" (Piety) and \"Prudentia\" (Prudency). The Latin inscription on the gates reads: \"Concordia res publicæ parvæ crescunt – discordia magnæ concidunt\" (\"In agreement small republics grow, because of disagreement great republics fall\").\n\nThe gate was largely destroyed by Soviet shelling in World War II, but was rebuilt in 1957. Although most artifacts of Germanness were eradicated after the city became Polish in 1945, an original German inscription on the gate was restored in the 1990s: \"\" (\"They shall prosper that love thee. Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.\" – Psalm 122)\n"}

She studied geology, vertebrate paleontology and Palaeolithic archaeology at the University of Bonn, and completed her doctoral dissertation on Jurassic Ammonites from France. Later in her career she was affiliated with the University of Tübingen.\n\nAfter marrying a man from Pune, Corvinus became interested in the geology and prehistory of India, which became the main focus of her research. She also worked in Africa, being part of the team that discovered Lucy, a female hominin belonging to \"Australopithecus afarensis\", and other prehistoric hominin sites in Ethiopia. In the 1970s, she worked for De Beers in Namibia, locating diamond deposits as well as fossil-bearing Miocene sediments.\n\nGudrun was not recognized immediately following her work and was not credited for her contribution towards her field.\n\nIn 1964, Corvinus examined the Pravara drainage system in the Nevasa area of Maharashtra through an independent multi-disciplinary project. After a survey on the geomorphology of the entire Pravara Valley, suggested by H.D. Sankalia, Corvinus came across the Archeulian factory site at the junction of Chirki with the Pravara, 2 miles downstream from Nevasa. After being funded by the Wenner-Gren Foundation and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (the German Research Council), she decided to excavate the site, which lasted 3 winter seasons from 1966-1969. The lengthy excavation resulted in the revelation of rich Early Archeulian assemblage in fine-grained context in the gullies of Chirki area. Besides this, a great number of well-preserved fossil wood pieces and tree trunks were found in the alluvium. In 1981, Corvinus published two of the most classic monographs, “ A Survey of the Pravara River System in Western Maharashtra, India” and “ A Survey of the Pravara River System in Western Maharashtra, India” in 1983. This makes her the first to publish monographs on the geology and archaeology of an Archaeulian site in the entire Indian subcontinent.\n\nIn 1985, following her work at Chirki-on-Neval (India), Gudrun Cornivus began explorations in the foothills of Siwalik Hills of Western Nepal. In the span of twelve years (1988-2006), she was rewarded with findings and discoveries of numerous Paleolithic sites and rich faunal and floral assemblages ranging from the Miocene to the Pleistocene. The discovery of an unexpected wealth of occupation sites from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic were found in the Dun Valleys of Dang-Deokhuri District in the Siwalik Hills, and an area along the Rato River in East Nepal. From a sandstone succession near Rato Khola, Corvinus discovered the skull of \"Archidiskodon planifrons\". Evidence of hand axe indicate human occupation can be dated back at least the late Middle Pleistocene. Most significantly, her finding of the Acheulian sites demonstrates that despite the scarce materials, the early South Asian Acheulian hominins were able to cross the vast Indo-Gangetic floodplain.\n\nOn 7 January 2006, Corvinus was found stabbed and beheaded in her apartment in Pune. Her head was found in a nearby riverbed.\n\nFakir Mohammed Shaikh, a 27-year-old real estate agent, was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to life in prison and a Rs 11,000 fine. He was also found guilty of destroying evidence and theft, carrying a sentence of seven years and three years of rigorous imprisonment respectively. The public prosecutor of the case, Neelima Vartak, stated that she was murdered for her property.\n\n"}

In his 1896 \"Studies in the Psychology of Sex\", Havelock Ellis wrote:\n\nIt is, perhaps, not difficult to account for the horror – much stronger than that normally felt toward a person of the same sex – with which the invert often regards the sexual organs of persons of the opposite sex. It cannot be said that the sexual organs of either sex under the influence of sexual excitement are esthetically pleasing; they only become emotionally desirable through the parallel excitement of the beholder. When the absence of parallel excitement is accompanied in the beholder by the sense of unfamiliarity as in childhood, or by a neurotic hypersensitiveness, the conditions are present for the production of intense \"horror feminae\" or \"horror masculis\", as the case may be. It is possible that, as Otto Rank argues in his interesting study, \"Die Nacktheit in Sage und Dichtung,\" [\"sic\"] this horror of the sexual organs of the opposite sex, to some extent felt even by normal people, is embodied in the Melusine type of legend.\nIn his book \"Sadism and Masochism: The Psychology of Hatred and Cruelty\", Wilhelm Stekel discusses \"horror feminae\" of a male masochist.\n\nIn \"The Dread of Woman\" (1932), Karen Horney traced the male dread of woman to the boy's fear that his genital is inadequate in relation to the mother.\n\nProfessor Eva Keuls argues that violent Amazons are the evidence of the obsessive fear of women in Classical Athens.\n\n"}
{"id": "13693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13693", "title": "Horace", "text": "Horace\n\nQuintus Horatius Flaccus (December 8, 65 BC – November 27, 8 BC), known in the English-speaking world as Horace (), was the leading Roman lyric poet during the time of Augustus (also known as Octavian). The rhetorician Quintilian regarded his \"Odes\" as just about the only Latin lyrics worth reading: \"He can be lofty sometimes, yet he is also full of charm and grace, versatile in his figures, and felicitously daring in his choice of words.\"\n\nHorace also crafted elegant hexameter verses (\"Satires\" and \"Epistles\") and caustic iambic poetry (\"Epodes\"). The hexameters are amusing yet serious works, friendly in tone, leading the ancient satirist Persius to comment: \"as his friend laughs, Horace slyly puts his finger on his every fault; once let in, he plays about the heartstrings\".\n\nHis career coincided with Rome's momentous change from a republic to an empire. An officer in the republican army defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, he was befriended by Octavian's right-hand man in civil affairs, Maecenas, and became a spokesman for the new regime. For some commentators, his association with the regime was a delicate balance in which he maintained a strong measure of independence (he was \"a master of the graceful sidestep\") but for others he was, in John Dryden's phrase, \"a well-mannered court slave\".\n\nHorace can be regarded as the world's first autobiographer – In his writings, he tells us far more about himself, his character, his development, and his way of life than any other great poet in antiquity. Some of the biographical writings contained in his writings can be supplemented from the short but valuable \"Life of Horace\" by Suetonius (in his \"Lives of the Poets\").\n\nHe was born on 8 December 65 BC in the Samnite south of Italy. His home town, Venusia, lay on a trade route in the border region between Apulia and Lucania (Basilicata). Various Italic dialects were spoken in the area and this perhaps enriched his feeling for language. He could have been familiar with Greek words even as a young boy and later he poked fun at the jargon of mixed Greek and Oscan spoken in neighbouring Canusium. One of the works he probably studied in school was the \"Odyssia\" of Livius Andronicus, taught by teachers like the 'Orbilius' mentioned in one of his poems. Army veterans could have been settled there at the expense of local families uprooted by Rome as punishment for their part in the Social War (91–88 BC). Such state-sponsored migration must have added still more linguistic variety to the area. According to a local tradition reported by Horace, a colony of Romans or Latins had been installed in Venusia after the Samnites had been driven out early in the third century. In that case, young Horace could have felt himself to be a Roman though there are also indications that he regarded himself as a Samnite or Sabellus by birth. Italians in modern and ancient times have always been devoted to their home towns, even after success in the wider world, and Horace was no different. Images of his childhood setting and references to it are found throughout his poems.\n\nHorace's father was probably a Venutian taken captive by Romans in the Social War, or possibly he was descended from a Sabine captured in the Samnite Wars. Either way, he was a slave for at least part of his life. He was evidently a man of strong abilities however and managed to gain his freedom and improve his social position. Thus Horace claimed to be the free-born son of a prosperous 'coactor'. The term 'coactor' could denote various roles, such as tax collector, but its use by Horace was explained by scholia as a reference to 'coactor argentareus' i.e. an auctioneer with some of the functions of a banker, paying the seller out of his own funds and later recovering the sum with interest from the buyer.\n\nThe father spent a small fortune on his son's education, eventually accompanying him to Rome to oversee his schooling and moral development. The poet later paid tribute to him in a poem that one modern scholar considers the best memorial by any son to his father. The poem includes this passage:\nIf my character is flawed by a few minor faults, but is otherwise decent and moral, if you can point out only a few scattered blemishes on an otherwise immaculate surface, if no one can accuse me of greed, or of prurience, or of profligacy, if I live a virtuous life, free of defilement (pardon, for a moment, my self-praise), and if I am to my friends a good friend, my father deserves all the credit... As it is now, he deserves from me unstinting gratitude and praise. I could never be ashamed of such a father, nor do I feel any need, as many people do, to apologize for being a freedman's son. \"Satires 1.6.65–92\"\nHe never mentioned his mother in his verses and he might not have known much about her. Perhaps she also had been a slave.\n\nHorace left Rome, possibly after his father's death, and continued his formal education in Athens, a great centre of learning in the ancient world, where he arrived at nineteen years of age, enrolling in The Academy. Founded by Plato, The Academy was now dominated by Epicureans and Stoics, whose theories and practises made a deep impression on the young man from Venusia. Meanwhile, he mixed and lounged about with the elite of Roman youth, such as Marcus, the idle son of Cicero, and the Pompeius to whom he later addressed a poem. It was in Athens too that he probably acquired deep familiarity with the ancient tradition of Greek lyric poetry, at that time largely the preserve of grammarians and academic specialists (access to such material was easier in Athens than in Rome, where the public libraries had yet to be built by Asinius Pollio and Augustus).\n\nRome's troubles following the assassination of Julius Caesar were soon to catch up with him. Marcus Junius Brutus came to Athens seeking support for the republican cause. Brutus was fêted around town in grand receptions and he made a point of attending academic lectures, all the while recruiting supporters among the young men studying there, including Horace. An educated young Roman could begin military service high in the ranks and Horace was made tribunus militum (one of six senior officers of a typical legion), a post usually reserved for men of senatorial or equestrian rank and which seems to have inspired jealousy among his well-born confederates. He learned the basics of military life while on the march, particularly in the wilds of northern Greece, whose rugged scenery became a backdrop to some of his later poems. It was there in 42 BC that Octavian (later Augustus) and his associate Mark Antony crushed the republican forces at the Battle of Philippi. Horace later recorded it as a day of embarrassment for himself, when he fled without his shield, but allowance should be made for his self-deprecating humour. Moreover, the incident allowed him to identify himself with some famous poets who had long ago abandoned their shields in battle, notably his heroes Alcaeus and Archilochus. The comparison with the latter poet is uncanny: Archilochus lost his shield in a part of Thrace near Philippi, and he was deeply involved in the Greek colonization of Thasos, where Horace's die-hard comrades finally surrendered.\n\nOctavian offered an early amnesty to his opponents and Horace quickly accepted it. On returning to Italy, he was confronted with yet another loss: his father's estate in Venusia was one of many throughout Italy to be confiscated for the settlement of veterans (Virgil lost his estate in the north about the same time). Horace later claimed that he was reduced to poverty and this led him to try his hand at poetry. In reality, there was no money to be had from versifying. At best, it offered future prospects through contacts with other poets and their patrons among the rich. Meanwhile, he obtained the sinecure of \"scriba quaestorius\", a civil service position at the \"aerarium\" or Treasury, profitable enough to be purchased even by members of the \"ordo equester\" and not very demanding in its work-load, since tasks could be delegated to \"scribae\" or permanent clerks. It was about this time that he began writing his \"Satires\" and \"Epodes\".\n\nThe \"Epodes\" belong to iambic poetry. Iambic poetry features insulting and obscene language; sometimes, it is referred to as \"blame poetry\". \"Blame poetry\", or \"shame poetry\", is poetry written to blame and shame fellow citizens into a sense of their social obligations. Horace modelled these poems on the poetry of Archilochus. Social bonds in Rome had been decaying since the destruction of Carthage a little more than a hundred years earlier, due to the vast wealth that could be gained by plunder and corruption. These social ills were magnified by rivalry between Julius Caesar, Mark Antony and confederates like Sextus Pompey, all jockeying for a bigger share of the spoils. One modern scholar has counted a dozen civil wars in the hundred years leading up to 31 BC, including the Spartacus rebellion, eight years before Horace's birth. As the heirs to Hellenistic culture, Horace and his fellow Romans were not well prepared to deal with these problems:\n\nHorace's Hellenistic background is clear in his Satires, even though the genre was unique to Latin literature. He brought to it a style and outlook suited to the social and ethical issues confronting Rome but he changed its role from public, social engagement to private meditation. Meanwhile, he was beginning to interest Octavian's supporters, a gradual process described by him in one of his satires. The way was opened for him by his friend, the poet Virgil, who had gained admission into the privileged circle around Maecenas, Octavian's lieutenant, following the success of his \"Eclogues\". An introduction soon followed and, after a discreet interval, Horace too was accepted. He depicted the process as an honourable one, based on merit and mutual respect, eventually leading to true friendship, and there is reason to believe that his relationship was genuinely friendly, not just with Maecenas but afterwards with Augustus as well. On the other hand, the poet has been unsympathetically described by one scholar as \"a sharp and rising young man, with an eye to the main chance.\" There were advantages on both sides: Horace gained encouragement and material support, the politicians gained a hold on a potential dissident. His republican sympathies, and his role at Philippi, may have caused him some pangs of remorse over his new status. However most Romans considered the civil wars to be the result of \"contentio dignitatis\", or rivalry between the foremost families of the city, and he too seems to have accepted the principate as Rome's last hope for much needed peace.\n\nIn 37 BC, Horace accompanied Maecenas on a journey to Brundisium, described in one of his poems as a series of amusing incidents and charming encounters with other friends along the way, such as Virgil. In fact the journey was political in its motivation, with Maecenas en route to negotiatie the Treaty of Tarentum with Antony, a fact Horace artfully keeps from the reader (political issues are largely avoided in the first book of satires). Horace was probably also with Maecenas on one of Octavian's naval expeditions against the piratical Sextus Pompeius, which ended in a disastrous storm off Palinurus in 36 BC, briefly alluded to by Horace in terms of near-drowning. There are also some indications in his verses that he was with Maecenas at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, where Octavian defeated his great rival, Antony. By then Horace had already received from Maecenas the famous gift of his Sabine farm, probably not long after the publication of the first book of \"Satires\". The gift, which included income from five tenants, may have ended his career at the Treasury, or at least allowed him to give it less time and energy. It signalled his identification with the Octavian regime yet, in the second book of \"Satires\" that soon followed, he continued the apolitical stance of the first book. By this time, he had attained the status of \"eques Romanus\", perhaps as a result of his work at the Treasury.\n\n\"Odes\" 1–3 were the next focus for his artistic creativity. He adapted their forms and themes from Greek lyric poetry of the seventh and sixth centuries BC. The fragmented nature of the Greek world had enabled his literary heroes to express themselves freely and his semi-retirement from the Treasury in Rome to his own estate in the Sabine hills perhaps empowered him to some extent also yet even when his lyrics touched on public affairs they reinforced the importance of private life. Nevertheless, his work in the period 30–27 BC began to show his closeness to the regime and his sensitivity to its developing ideology. In \"Odes\" 1.2, for example, he eulogized Octavian in hyperboles that echo Hellenistic court poetry. The name \"Augustus\", which Octavian assumed in January 27 BC, is first attested in \"Odes\" 3.3 and 3.5. In the period 27–24 BC, political allusions in the \"Odes\" concentrated on foreign wars in Britain (1.35), Arabia (1.29) Spain (3.8) and Parthia (2.2). He greeted Augustus on his return to Rome in 24 BC as a beloved ruler upon whose good health he depended for his own happiness (3.14).\n\nThe public reception of \"Odes\" 1–3 disappointed him however. He attributed the lack of success to jealousy among imperial courtiers and to his isolation from literary cliques. Perhaps it was disappointment that led him to put aside the genre in favour of verse letters. He addressed his first book of \"Epistles\" to a variety of friends and acquaintances in an urbane style reflecting his new social status as a knight. In the opening poem, he professed a deeper interest in moral philosophy than poetry but, though the collection demonstrates a leaning towards stoic theory, it reveals no sustained thinking about ethics. Maecenas was still the dominant confidante but Horace had now begun to assert his own independence, suavely declining constant invitations to attend his patron. In the final poem of the first book of \"Epistles\", he revealed himself to be forty-four years old in the consulship of Lollius and Lepidus i.e. 21 BC, and \"of small stature, fond of the sun, prematurely grey, quick-tempered but easily placated\".\n\nAccording to Suetonius, the second book of \"Epistles\" was prompted by Augustus, who desired a verse epistle to be addressed to himself. Augustus was in fact a prolific letter-writer and he once asked Horace to be his personal secretary. Horace refused the secretarial role but complied with the emperor's request for a verse letter. The letter to Augustus may have been slow in coming, being published possibly as late as 11 BC. It celebrated, among other things, the 15 BC military victories of his stepsons, Drusus and Tiberius, yet it and the following letter were largely devoted to literary theory and criticism. The literary theme was explored still further in \"Ars Poetica\", published separately but written in the form of an epistle and sometimes referred to as \"Epistles\" 2.3 (possibly the last poem he ever wrote). He was also commissioned to write odes commemorating the victories of Drusus and Tiberius and one to be sung in a temple of Apollo for the Secular Games, a long abandoned festival that Augustus revived in accordance with his policy of recreating ancient customs (\"Carmen Saeculare\").\n\nSuetonius recorded some gossip about Horace's sexual activities late in life, claiming that the walls of his bedchamber were covered with obscene pictures and mirrors, so that he saw erotica wherever he looked. The poet died at 56 years of age, not long after his friend Maecenas, near whose tomb he was laid to rest. Both men bequeathed their property to Augustus, an honour that the emperor expected of his friends.\n\nThe dating of Horace's works isn't known precisely and scholars often debate the exact order in which they were first 'published'. There are persuasive arguments for the following chronology:\n\nHorace composed in traditional metres borrowed from Archaic Greece, employing hexameters in his \"Satires\" and \"Epistles\", and iambs in his \"Epodes\", all of which were relatively easy to adapt into Latin forms. His \"Odes\" featured more complex measures, including alcaics and sapphics, which were sometimes a difficult fit for Latin structure and syntax. Despite these traditional metres, he presented himself as a partisan in the development of a new and sophisticated style. He was influenced in particular by Hellenistic aesthetics of brevity, elegance and polish, as modeled in the work of Callimachus.\nIn modern literary theory, a distinction is often made between immediate personal experience (\"Urerlebnis\") and experience mediated by cultural vectors such as literature, philosophy and the visual arts (\"Bildungserlebnis\"). The distinction has little relevance for Horace however since his personal and literary experiences are implicated in each other. \"Satires\" 1.5, for example, recounts in detail a real trip Horace made with Virgil and some of his other literary friends, and which parallels a Satire by Lucilius, his predecessor. Unlike much Hellenistic-inspired literature, however, his poetry was not composed for a small coterie of admirers and fellow poets, nor does it rely on abstruse allusions for many of its effects. Though elitist in its literary standards, it was written for a wide audience, as a public form of art. Ambivalence also characterizes his literary persona, since his presentation of himself as part of a small community of philosophically aware people, seeking true peace of mind while shunning vices like greed, was well adapted to Augustus's plans to reform public morality, corrupted by greedhis personal plea for moderation was part of the emperor's grand message to the nation.\n\nHorace generally followed the examples of poets established as classics in different genres, such as Archilochus in the \"Epodes\", Lucilius in the \"Satires\" and Alcaeus in the \"Odes\", later broadening his scope for the sake of variation and because his models weren't actually suited to the realities confronting him. Archilochus and Alcaeus were aristocratic Greeks whose poetry had a social and religious function that was immediately intelligible to their audiences but which became a mere artifice or literary motif when transposed to Rome. However, the artifice of the \"Odes\" is also integral to their success, since they could now accommodate a wide range of emotional effects, and the blend of Greek and Roman elements adds a sense of detachment and universality. Horace proudly claimed to introduce into Latin the spirit and iambic poetry of Archilochus but (unlike Archilochus) without persecuting anyone (\"Epistles\" 1.19.23–5). It was no idle boast. His \"Epodes\" were modeled on the verses of the Greek poet, as 'blame poetry', yet he avoided targeting real scapegoats. Whereas Archilochus presented himself as a serious and vigorous opponent of wrong-doers, Horace aimed for comic effects and adopted the persona of a weak and ineffectual critic of his times (as symbolized for example in his surrender to the witch Canidia in the final epode). He also claimed to be the first to introduce into Latin the lyrical methods of Alcaeus (\"Epistles\" 1.19.32–3) and he actually was the first Latin poet to make consistent use of Alcaic meters and themes: love, politics and the symposium. He imitated other Greek lyric poets as well, employing a 'motto' technique, beginning each ode with some reference to a Greek original and then diverging from it.\n\nThe satirical poet Lucilius was a senator's son who could castigate his peers with impunity. Horace was a mere freedman's son who had to tread carefully. Lucilius was a rugged patriot and a significant voice in Roman self-awareness, endearing himself to his countrymen by his blunt frankness and explicit politics. His work expressed genuine freedom or libertas. His style included 'metrical vandalism' and looseness of structure. Horace instead adopted an oblique and ironic style of satire, ridiculing stock characters and anonymous targets. His libertas was the private freedom of a philosophical outlook, not a political or social privilege. His \"Satires\" are relatively easy-going in their use of meter (relative to the tight lyric meters of the \"Odes\") but formal and highly controlled relative to the poems of Lucilius, whom Horace mocked for his sloppy standards (\"Satires\" 1.10.56–61)\n\nThe \"Epistles\" may be considered among Horace's most innovative works. There was nothing like it in Greek or Roman literature. Occasionally poems had had some resemblance to letters, including an elegiac poem from Solon to Mimnermus and some lyrical poems from Pindar to Hieron of Syracuse. Lucilius had composed a satire in the form of a letter, and some epistolary poems were composed by Catullus and Propertius. But nobody before Horace had ever composed an entire collection of verse letters, let alone letters with a focus on philosophical problems. The sophisticated and flexible style that he had developed in his \"Satires\" was adapted to the more serious needs of this new genre. Such refinement of style was not unusual for Horace. His craftsmanship as a wordsmith is apparent even in his earliest attempts at this or that kind of poetry, but his handling of each genre tended to improve over time as he adapted it to his own needs. Thus for example it is generally agreed that his second book of \"Satires\", where human folly is revealed through dialogue between characters, is superior to the first, where he propounds his ethics in monologues. Nevertheless, the first book includes some of his most popular poems.\n\nHorace developed a number of inter-related themes throughout his poetic career, including politics, love, philosophy and ethics, his own social role, as well as poetry itself. His \"Epodes\" and \"Satires\" are forms of 'blame poetry' and both have a natural affinity with the moralising and diatribes of Cynicism. This often takes the form of allusions to the work and philosophy of Bion of Borysthenes but it is as much a literary game as a philosophical alignment. By the time he composed his \"Epistles\", he was a critic of Cynicism along with all impractical and \"high-falutin\" philosophy in general. The \"Satires\" also include a strong element of Epicureanism, with frequent allusions to the Epicurean poet Lucretius. So for example the Epicurean sentiment \"carpe diem\" is the inspiration behind Horace's repeated punning on his own name (\"Horatius ~ hora\") in \"Satires\" 2.6. The \"Satires\" also feature some Stoic, Peripatetic and Platonic (\"Dialogues\") elements. In short, the \"Satires\" present a medley of philosophical programs, dished up in no particular ordera style of argument typical of the genre. The \"Odes\" display a wide range of topics. Over time, he becomes more confident about his political voice. Although he is often thought of as an overly intellectual lover, he is ingenuous in representing passion. The \"Odes\" weave various philosophical strands together, with allusions and statements of doctrine present in about a third of the \"Odes\" Books 1–3, ranging from the flippant (1.22, 3.28) to the solemn (2.10, 3.2, 3.3). Epicureanism is the dominant influence, characterizing about twice as many of these odes as Stoicism. A group of odes combines these two influences in tense relationships, such as \"Odes\" 1.7, praising Stoic virility and devotion to public duty while also advocating private pleasures among friends. While generally favouring the Epicurean lifestyle, the lyric poet is as eclectic as the satiric poet, and in \"Odes\" 2.10 even proposes Aristotle's golden mean as a remedy for Rome's political troubles. Many of Horace's poems also contain much reflection on genre, the lyric tradition, and the function of poetry. \"Odes\" 4, thought to be composed at the emperor's request, takes the themes of the first three books of \"Odes\" to a new level. This book shows greater poetic confidence after the public performance of his \"Carmen saeculare\" or \"Century hymn\" at a public festival orchestrated by Augustus. In it, Horace addresses the emperor Augustus directly with more confidence and proclaims his power to grant poetic immortality to those he praises. It is the least philosophical collection of his verses, excepting the twelfth ode, addressed to the dead Virgil as if he were living. In that ode, the epic poet and the lyric poet are aligned with Stoicism and Epicureanism respectively, in a mood of bitter-sweet pathos. The first poem of the \"Epistles\" sets the philosophical tone for the rest of the collection: \"So now I put aside both verses and all those other games: What is true and what befits is my care, this my question, this my whole concern.\" His poetic renunciation of poetry in favour of philosophy is intended to be ambiguous. Ambiguity is the hallmark of the \"Epistles\". It is uncertain if those being addressed by the self-mocking poet-philosopher are being honoured or criticized. Though he emerges as an Epicurean, it is on the understanding that philosophical preferences, like political and social choices, are a matter of personal taste. Thus he depicts the ups and downs of the philosophical life more realistically than do most philosophers.\n\nThe reception of Horace's work has varied from one epoch to another and varied markedly even in his own lifetime. \"Odes\" 1–3 were not well received when first 'published' in Rome, yet Augustus later commissioned a ceremonial ode for the Centennial Games in 17 BC and also encouraged the publication of \"Odes\" 4, after which Horace's reputation as Rome's premier lyricist was assured. His Odes were to become the best received of all his poems in ancient times, acquiring a classic status that discouraged imitation: no other poet produced a comparable body of lyrics in the four centuries that followed (though that might also be attributed to social causes, particularly the parasitism that Italy was sinking into). In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, ode-writing became highly fashionable in England and a large number of aspiring poets imitated Horace both in English and in Latin.\n\nIn a verse epistle to Augustus (Epistle 2.1), in 12 BC, Horace argued for classic status to be awarded to contemporary poets, including Virgil and apparently himself. In the final poem of his third book of Odes he claimed to have created for himself a monument more durable than bronze (\"Exegi monumentum aere perennius\", \"Carmina\" 3.30.1). For one modern scholar, however, Horace's personal qualities are more notable than the monumental quality of his achievement:\nYet for men like Wilfred Owen, scarred by experiences of World War I, his poetry stood for discredited values:\n\nThe same motto, \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\", had been adapted to the ethos of martyrdom in the lyrics of early Christian poets like Prudentius.\n\nThese preliminary comments touch on a small sample of developments in the reception of Horace's work. More developments are covered epoch by epoch in the following sections.\n\nHorace's influence can be observed in the work of his near contemporaries, Ovid and Propertius. Ovid followed his example in creating a completely natural style of expression in hexameter verse, and Propertius cheekily mimicked him in his third book of elegies. His \"Epistles\" provided them both with a model for their own verse letters and it also shaped Ovid's exile poetry.\n\nHis influence had a perverse aspect. As mentioned before, the brilliance of his \"Odes\" may have discouraged imitation. Conversely, they may have created a vogue for the lyrics of the archaic Greek poet Pindar, due to the fact that Horace had neglected that style of lyric (see Pindar#Influence and legacy). The iambic genre seems almost to have disappeared after publication of Horace's \"Epodes\". Ovid's \"Ibis\" was a rare attempt at the form but it was inspired mainly by Callimachus, and there are some iambic elements in Martial but the main influence there was Catullus. A revival of popular interest in the satires of Lucilius may have been inspired by Horace's criticism of his unpolished style. Both Horace and Lucilius were considered good role-models by Persius, who critiqued his own satires as lacking both the acerbity of Lucillius and the gentler touch of Horace. Juvenal's caustic satire was influenced mainly by Lucilius but Horace by then was a school classic and Juvenal could refer to him respectfully and in a round-about way as \"the Venusine lamp\".\n\nStatius paid homage to Horace by composing one poem in Sapphic and one in Alcaic meter (the verse forms most often associated with \"Odes\"), which he included in his collection of occasional poems, \"Silvae\". Ancient scholars wrote commentaries on the lyric meters of the \"Odes\", including the scholarly poet Caesius Bassus. By a process called \"derivatio\", he varied established meters through the addition or omission of syllables, a technique borrowed by Seneca the Younger when adapting Horatian meters to the stage.\n\nHorace's poems continued to be school texts into late antiquity. Works attributed to Helenius Acro and Pomponius Porphyrio are the remnants of a much larger body of Horatian scholarship. Porphyrio arranged the poems in non-chronological order, beginning with the \"Odes\", because of their general popularity and their appeal to scholars (the \"Odes\" were to retain this privileged position in the medieval manuscript tradition and thus in modern editions also). Horace was often evoked by poets of the fourth century, such as Ausonius and Claudian. Prudentius presented himself as a Christian Horace, adapting Horatian meters to his own poetry and giving Horatian motifs a Christian tone. On the other hand, St Jerome, modelled an uncompromising response to the pagan Horace, observing: \"What harmony can there be between Christ and the Devil? What has Horace to do with the Psalter?\" By the early sixth century, Horace and Prudentius were both part of a classical heritage that was struggling to survive the disorder of the times. Boethius, the last major author of classical Latin literature, could still take inspiration from Horace, sometimes mediated by Senecan tragedy. It can be argued that Horace's influence extended beyond poetry to dignify core themes and values of the early Christian era, such as self-sufficiency, inner contentment and courage.\n\nClassical texts almost ceased being copied in the period between the mid sixth century and the Carolingian revival. Horace's work probably survived in just two or three books imported into northern Europe from Italy. These became the ancestors of six extant manuscripts dated to the ninth century. Two of those six manuscripts are French in origin, one was produced in Alsace, and the other three show Irish influence but were probably written in continental monasteries (Lombardy for example). By the last half of the ninth century, it was not uncommon for literate people to have direct experience of Horace's poetry. His influence on the Carolingian Renaissance can be found in the poems of Heiric of Auxerre and in some manuscripts marked with neumes, mysterious notations that may have been an aid to the memorization and discussion of his lyric meters. \"Ode\" is neumed with the melody of a hymn to John the Baptist, \"Ut queant laxis\", composed in Sapphic stanzas. This hymn later became the basis of the solfege system (\"Do, re, mi...\")an association with western music quite appropriate for a lyric poet like Horace, though the language of the hymn is mainly Prudentian. Lyons argues that the melody in question was linked with Horace's Ode well before Guido d'Arezzo fitted Ut queant laxis to it. However, the melody is unlikely to be a survivor from classical times, although Ovid testifies to Horace's use of the lyre while performing his Odes.\n\nThe German scholar, Ludwig Traube, once dubbed the tenth and eleventh centuries \"The age of Horace\" (\"aetas Horatiana\"), and placed it between the \"aetas Vergiliana\" of the eighth and ninth centuries, and the \"aetas Ovidiana\" of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a distinction supposed to reflect the dominant classical Latin influences of those times. Such a distinction is over-schematized since Horace was a substantial influence in the ninth century as well. Traube had focused too much on Horace's \"Satires\". Almost all of Horace's work found favor in the Medieval period. In fact medieval scholars were also guilty of over-schematism, associating Horace's different genres with the different ages of man. A twelfth century scholar encapsulated the theory: \"...Horace wrote four different kinds of poems on account of the four ages, the \"Odes\" for boys, the \"Ars Poetica\" for young men, the \"Satires\" for mature men, the \"Epistles\" for old and complete men.\" It was even thought that Horace had composed his works in the order in which they had been placed by ancient scholars. Despite its naivety, the schematism involved an appreciation of Horace's works as a collection, the \"Ars Poetica\", \"Satires\" and \"Epistles\" appearing to find favour as well as the \"Odes\". The later Middle Ages however gave special significance to \"Satires\" and \"Epistles\", being considered Horace's mature works. Dante referred to Horace as \"Orazio satiro\", and he awarded him a privileged position in the first circle of Hell, with Homer, Ovid and Lucan.\n\nHorace's popularity is revealed in the large number of quotes from all his works found in almost every genre of medieval literature, and also in the number of poets imitating him in quantitative Latin meter . The most prolific imitator of his \"Odes\" was the Bavarian monk, Metellus of Tegernsee, who dedicated his work to the patron saint of Tegernsee Abbey, St Quirinus, around the year 1170. He imitated all Horace's lyrical meters then followed these up with imitations of other meters used by Prudentius and Boethius, indicating that variety, as first modelled by Horace, was considered a fundamental aspect of the lyric genre. The content of his poems however was restricted to simple piety. Among the most successful imitators of \"Satires\" and \"Epistles\" was another Germanic author, calling himself Sextus Amarcius, around 1100, who composed four books, the first two exemplifying vices, the second pair mainly virtues.\n\nPetrarch is a key figure in the imitation of Horace in accentual meters. His verse letters in Latin were modelled on the \"Epistles\" and he wrote a letter to Horace in the form of an ode. However he also borrowed from Horace when composing his Italian sonnets. One modern scholar has speculated that authors who imitated Horace in accentual rhythms (including stressed Latin and vernacular languages) may have considered their work a natural sequel to Horace's metrical variety. In France, Horace and Pindar were the poetic models for a group of vernacular authors called the Pléiade, including for example Pierre de Ronsard and Joachim du Bellay. Montaigne made constant and inventive use of Horatian quotes. The vernacular languages were dominant in Spain and Portugal in the sixteenth century, where Horace's influence is notable in the works of such authors as Garcilaso de la Vega, Juan Boscán Sá de Miranda, Antonio Ferreira and Fray Luis de León, the latter for example writing odes on the Horatian theme \"beatus ille\" (\"happy the man\"). The sixteenth century in western Europe was also an age of translations (except in Germany, where Horace wasn't translated until well into the seventeenth century). The first English translator was Thomas Drant, who placed translations of Jeremiah and Horace side by side in \"Medicinable Morall\", 1566. That was also the year that the Scot George Buchanan paraphrased the Psalms in a Horatian setting. Ben Jonson put Horace on the stage in 1601 in \"Poetaster\", along with other classical Latin authors, giving them all their own verses to speak in translation. Horace's part evinces the independent spirit, moral earnestness and critical insight that many readers look for in his poems.\n\nDuring the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, or the Age of Enlightenment, neo-classical culture was pervasive. English literature in the middle of that period has been dubbed Augustan. It is not always easy to distinguish Horace's influence during those centuries (the mixing of influences is shown for example in one poet's pseudonym, \"Horace Juvenal\"). However a measure of his influence can be found in the diversity of the people interested in his works, both among readers and authors.\n\nNew editions of his works were published almost yearly. There were three new editions in 1612 (two in Leiden, one in Frankfurt) and again in 1699 (Utrecht, Barcelona, Cambridge). Cheap editions were plentiful and fine editions were also produced, including one whose entire text was engraved by John Pine in copperplate. The poet James Thomson owned five editions of Horace's work and the physician James Douglas had five hundred books with Horace-related titles. Horace was often commended in periodicals such as The Spectator, as a hallmark of good judgement, moderation and manliness, a focus for moralising. His verses offered a fund of mottoes, such as \"simplex munditiis\", (elegance in simplicity) \"splendide mendax\" (nobly untruthful.), \"sapere aude\", \"nunc est bibendum\", \"carpe diem\" (the latter perhaps being the only one still in common use today), quoted even in works as prosaic as Edmund Quincy's \"A treatise of hemp-husbandry\" (1765). The fictional hero Tom Jones recited his verses with feeling. His works were also used to justify commonplace themes, such as patriotic obedience, as in James Parry's English lines from an Oxford University collection in 1736:\n\nHoratian-style lyrics were increasingly typical of Oxford and Cambridge verse collections for this period, most of them in Latin but some like the previous ode in English. John Milton's Lycidas first appeared in such a collection. It has few Horatian echoes yet Milton's associations with Horace were lifelong. He composed a controversial version of \"Odes\" 1.5, and Paradise Lost includes references to Horace's 'Roman' \"Odes\" 3.1–6 (Book 7 for example begins with echoes of \"Odes\" 3.4). Yet Horace's lyrics could offer inspiration to libertines as well as moralists, and neo-Latin sometimes served as a kind of discrete veil for the risqué. Thus for example Benjamin Loveling authored a catalogue of Drury Lane and Covent Garden prostitutes, in Sapphic stanzas, and an encomium for a dying lady \"of salacious memory\". Some Latin imitations of Horace were politically subversive, such as a marriage ode by Anthony Alsop that included a rallying cry for the Jacobite cause. On the other hand, Andrew Marvell took inspiration from Horace's \"Odes\" 1.37 to compose his English masterpiece Horatian Ode upon Cromwell's Return from Ireland, in which subtly nuanced reflections on the execution of Charles I echo Horace's ambiguous response to the death of Cleopatra (Marvell's ode was suppressed in spite of its subtlety and only began to be widely published in 1776). Samuel Johnson took particular pleasure in reading \"The Odes\". Alexander Pope wrote direct \"Imitations\" of Horace (published with the original Latin alongside) and also echoed him in \"Essays\" and The Rape of the Lock. He even emerged as \"a quite Horatian Homer\" in his translation of the \"Iliad\". Horace appealed also to female poets, such as Anna Seward (\"Original sonnets on various subjects, and odes paraphrased from Horace\", 1799) and Elizabeth Tollet, who composed a Latin ode in Sapphic meter to celebrate her brother's return from overseas, with tea and coffee substituted for the wine of Horace's sympotic settings:\nHorace's \"Ars Poetica\" is second only to Aristotle's \"Poetics\" in its influence on literary theory and criticism. Milton recommended both works in his treatise \"of Education\". Horace's \"Satires\" and \"Epistles\" however also had a huge impact, influencing theorists and critics such as John Dryden. There was considerable debate over the value of different lyrical forms for contemporary poets, as represented on one hand by the kind of four-line stanzas made familiar by Horace's Sapphic and Alcaic \"Odes\" and, on the other, the loosely structured Pindarics associated with the odes of Pindar. Translations occasionally involved scholars in the dilemmas of censorship. Thus Christopher Smart entirely omitted \"Odes\" and re-numbered the remaining odes. He also removed the ending of \"Odes\" . Thomas Creech printed \"Epodes\" and in the original Latin but left out their English translations. Philip Francis left out both the English and Latin for those same two epodes, a gap in the numbering the only indication that something was amiss. French editions of Horace were influential in England and these too were regularly bowdlerized.\n\nMost European nations had their own 'Horaces': thus for example Friedrich von Hagedorn was called \"The German Horace\" and Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski \"The Polish Horace\" (the latter was much imitated by English poets such as Henry Vaughan and Abraham Cowley). Pope Urban VIII wrote voluminously in Horatian meters, including an ode on gout.\n\nHorace maintained a central role in the education of English-speaking elites right up until the 1960s. A pedantic emphasis on the formal aspects of language-learning at the expense of literary appreciation may have made him unpopular in some quarters yet it also confirmed his influencea tension in his reception that underlies Byron's famous lines from \"Childe Harold\" (Canto iv, 77):\n\nWilliam Wordsworth's mature poetry, including the preface to Lyrical Ballads, reveals Horace's influence in its rejection of false ornament and he once expressed \"a wish / to meet the shade of Horace...\". John Keats echoed the opening of Horace's \"Epodes\" 14 in the opening lines of \"Ode to a Nightingale\".\n\nThe Roman poet was presented in the nineteenth century as an honorary English gentleman. William Thackeray produced a version of \"Odes\" in which Horace's questionable 'boy' became 'Lucy', and Gerard Manley Hopkins translated the boy innocently as 'child'. Horace was translated by Sir Theodore Martin (biographer of Prince Albert) but minus some ungentlemanly verses, such as the erotic \"Odes\" and \"Epodes\" 8 and 12. Lord Lytton produced a popular translation and William Gladstone also wrote translations during his last days as Prime Minister.\n\nEdward FitzGerald's \"Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam\", though formally derived from the Persian \"ruba'i\", nevertheless shows a strong Horatian influence, since, as one modern scholar has observed,\"...the quatrains inevitably recall the stanzas of the 'Odes', as does the narrating first person of the world-weary, ageing Epicurean Omar himself, mixing sympotic exhortation and 'carpe diem' with splendid moralising and 'memento mori' nihilism.\"\" Matthew Arnold advised a friend in verse not to worry about politics, an echo of \"Odes\" , yet later became a critic of Horace's inadequacies relative to Greek poets, as role models of Victorian virtues, observing: \"If human life were complete without faith, without enthusiasm, without energy, Horace...would be the perfect interpreter of human life.\" Christina Rossetti composed a sonnet depicting a woman willing her own death steadily, drawing on Horace's depiction of 'Glycera' in \"Odes\" and Cleopatra in \"Odes\" . A. E. Housman considered \"Odes\" , in Archilochian couplets, the most beautiful poem of antiquity and yet he generally shared Horace's penchant for quatrains, being readily adapted to his own elegiac and melancholy strain. The most famous poem of Ernest Dowson took its title and its heroine's name from a line of \"Odes\" , \"Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno Cynarae\", as well as its motif of nostalgia for a former flame. Kipling wrote a famous parody of the \"Odes\", satirising their stylistic idiosyncrasies and especially the extraordinary syntax, but he also used Horace's Roman patriotism as a focus for British imperialism, as in the story \"Regulus\" in the school collection \"Stalky & Co.\", which he based on \"Odes\" . Wilfred Owen's famous poem, quoted above, incorporated Horatian text to question patriotism while ignoring the rules of Latin scansion. However, there were few other echoes of Horace in the war period, possibly because war is not actually a major theme of Horace's work.\nBoth W.H.Auden and Louis MacNeice began their careers as teachers of classics and both responded as poets to Horace's influence. Auden for example evoked the fragile world of the 1930s in terms echoing \"Odes\" , where Horace advises a friend not to let worries about frontier wars interfere with current pleasures.\n\nThe American poet, Robert Frost, echoed Horace's \"Satires\" in the conversational and sententious idiom of some of his longer poems, such as \"The Lesson for Today\" (1941), and also in his gentle advocacy of life on the farm, as in \"Hyla Brook\" (1916), evoking Horace's \"fons Bandusiae\" in \"Ode\" . Now at the start of the third millennium, poets are still absorbing and re-configuring the Horatian influence, sometimes in translation (such as a 2002 English/American edition of the \"Odes\" by thirty-six poets) and sometimes as inspiration for their own work (such as a 2003 collection of odes by a New Zealand poet).\n\nHorace's \"Epodes\" have largely been ignored in the modern era, excepting those with political associations of historical significance. The obscene qualities of some of the poems have repulsed even scholars yet more recently a better understanding of the nature of Iambic poetry has led to a re-evaluation of the \"whole\" collection. A re-appraisal of the \"Epodes\" also appears in creative adaptations by recent poets (such as a 2004 collection of poems that relocates the ancient context to a 1950s industrial town).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2107559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2107559", "title": "Islamic feminism", "text": "Islamic feminism\n\nA combination of Islam and feminism has been advocated as \"a feminist discourse and practice articulated within an Islamic paradigm\" by Margot Badran in 2002. Islamic feminists ground their arguments in Islam and its teachings, seek the full equality of women and men in the personal and public sphere, and can include non-Muslims in the discourse and debate. Islamic feminism is defined by Islamic scholars as being more radical than secular feminism and as being anchored within the discourse of Islam with the Quran as its central text. \nAs a \"school of thought\", it is said to refer to Moroccan sociologist \"Fatema Mernissi and scholars such as Amina Wadud and Leila Ahmed\".\n\nAdvocates refer to the observation that Muslim majority countries produced several female heads of state, prime ministers, and state secretaries such as Lala Shovkat of Azerbaijan, Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Mame Madior Boye of Senegal, Tansu Çiller of Turkey, Kaqusha Jashari of Kosovo, and Megawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia. In Bangladesh, Khaleda Zia was elected the country's first female prime minister in 1991, and served as prime minister until 2009, when she was replaced by Sheikh Hasina, who maintains the prime minister's office at present making Bangladesh the country with the longest continuous female premiership .\n\nThere are substantial differences to be noted between the terms 'Islamic feminist' and 'Islamist'. Any of these terms can be used of men or women.\n\nIslamic feminists interpret the religious texts in a feminist perspective. They can be viewed as a branch of interpreters who ground their arguments in Islam and its teachings, seek the full equality of women and men in the personal and public sphere, and can include non-Muslims in the discourse and debate.\n\nIslamic feminism is defined by Islamic scholars as being more radical than secular feminism, and as being anchored within the discourse of Islam with the Quran as its central text.\n\nDuring recent times, the concept of Islamic feminism has grown further with Islamic groups looking to garner support from many aspects of society. In addition, educated Muslim women are striving to articulate their role in society.\n\nIslamists are advocates of political Islam, the notion that the Quran and hadith mandate a caliphate, i.e. an Islamic government. Some Islamists advocate women's rights in the public sphere but do not challenge gender inequality in the personal, private sphere. Su'ad al-Fatih al-Badawi, a Sudanese academic and Islamist politician, has argued that feminism is incompatible with \"taqwa\" (the Islamic conception of piety), and thus Islam and feminism are mutually exclusive. Margot Badran of Georgetown University’s Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding argues that Islam and feminism are not mutually exclusive and that “Islamic feminism, which derives its understanding and mandate from the Qur'an, seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in the totality of their existence. Islamic feminism is both highly contested and firmly embraced.” \n\nDuring the early days of Islam in the 7th century CE, changes in women's rights affected marriage, divorce and inheritance. \"The Oxford Dictionary of Islam\" argues for a general improvement of the status of women in Arab societies, including the prohibition of female infanticide, though some historians believe that infanticide was practiced both before and after Islam. \n\nUnder Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a status but rather as a contract, in which the woman's consent was imperative, either by active consent or silence. \"The dowry, previously regarded as a bride-price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property\" (see also Dower).\n\nWilliam Montgomery Watt states that Muhammad, in the historical context of his time, can be seen as a figure who testified on behalf of women's rights and improved things considerably. Watt explains: \"At the time Islam began, the conditions of women were terrible – they had no right to own property, were supposed to be the property of the man, and if the man died everything went to his sons.\" Muhammad, however, by \"instituting rights of property ownership, inheritance, education and divorce, gave women certain basic safeguards.\" Haddad and Esposito state that \"Muhammad granted women rights and privileges in the sphere of family life, marriage, education, and economic endeavors, rights that help improve women's status in society.\"\n\nFeminist critics of the notion that Islam significantly bettered the status of women include Leila Ahmed, who states that Islamic records show that at least some women in pre-Islamic Arabia inherited wealth, ran businesses, chose their own husbands, and worked in respected professions. Fatima Mernissi similarly argues that customs in pre-Islamic Arabia were more permissive of female sexuality and social independence, not less. \n\nMahood A, Moel J, Hudson C, and Leathers L. conducted a study and questioned individual women about how their role as a woman in their religion and if it empowering them in any way, an interviewee states \"In Islam and its teachings are capable of giving women an equal footing in society to men, and that Islam does not relegate women to the private sphere. I really believe some Muslims have distorted our teachings and forgotten our heritage. I believe that Islam can be used as a source of empowerment for women.” \n\nWhilst the pre-modern period lacked a formal feminist movement, nevertheless a number of important figures argued for improving women's rights and autonomy. These range from the medieval mystic and philosopher Ibn Arabi, who argued that women could achieve spiritual stations as equally high as men. In later eras, Nana Asma’u, daughter of eighteenth-century reformer Usman Dan Fodio, pushed for literacy and the education of Muslim women.\n\nWealthy noblewomen often funded Islamic religious and learning establishments, though few of those establishments admitted female students until the twentieth century. For example, Fatima al-Fihri's founding of the University of Al Karaouine in 859 CE, though the university only admitted women (the most notable of whom was Fatima al-Kabbaj) in the 1900s. This continued through to the Ayyubid dynasty in the 12th and 13th centuries: of 160 mosques and madrasahs established in Damascus, women funded 26 through the Waqf (charitable trust or trust law) system. Half of all the royal patrons for these institutions were also women.\n\nAccording to the Sunni scholar Ibn Asakir in the 12th century, there were opportunities for female education. He wrote that girls and women could study, earn \"ijazahs\" (academic degrees) and qualify as scholars (\"ulema\") and teachers. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters. Ibn Asakir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers. Muhammad is said to have praised the women of Medina for their desire for religious knowledge: \"How splendid were the women of the \"ansar\"; shame did not prevent them from becoming learned in the faith.\"\n\nWhile it was extremely rare for women to enroll as students in formal classes, they did attend informal lectures and study sessions at mosques, madrasahs and other public places. Some men did not approve of this practice. For example, Muhammad ibn al-Hajj (d. 1336) was appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally audited lectures in his time:\n\nOn the question of women in medieval Islam, Abdul Hakim Murad writes:\n\nthe orientalist Ignaz Goldziher showed that perhaps fifteen percent of medieval hadith scholars were women, teaching in the mosques and universally admired for their integrity. Colleges such as the Saqlatuniya Madrasa in Cairo were funded and staffed entirely by women.\nIn the 15th century, Al-Sakhawi devotes an entire volume of his 12-volume biographical dictionary \"Daw al-lami\" to female scholars, giving information on 1,075 of them.\n\nWhen the Taliban assumed power in 1995, women's education was outlawed, and forced to go underground. Once the Taliban was overthrown, there is an opportunity for women's education to resurface once again, but it is difficult due to remaining stigmas and male power in the system. In August 2012, official Iranian sources released the news that women would be restricted from joining undergraduate courses in 77 technical, science, and engineering programs in 36 different Iranian Universities.\n\nThe labor force in the Caliphate came from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, while both men and women were involved in diverse occupations and economic activities. Women were employed in a wide range of commercial activities and diverse occupations in the primary sector (as farmers for example), secondary sector (as construction workers, dyers, spinners, etc.) and tertiary sector (as investors, doctors, nurses, presidents of guilds, brokers, peddlers, lenders, scholars, etc.). Muslim women also held a monopoly over certain branches of the textile industry, the largest and most specialized and market-oriented industry at the time, in occupations such as spinning, dyeing, and embroidery.\n\nIn the 12th century, the famous Islamic philosopher and \"qadi\" (judge) Ibn Rushd, known to the West as \"Averroes\", claimed that women were equal to men in all respects and possessed equal capacities to shine in peace and in war, citing examples of female warriors among the Arabs, Greeks and Africans to support his case. In early Muslim history, examples of notable women who fought during the Muslim conquests and Fitna (civil wars) as soldiers or generals included Nusaybah Bint k'ab Al Maziniyyah, Aisha, Kahula and Wafeira.\n\nWomen under Islamic law have the ability to inherit and bestow inheritance; independently manage their financial affairs; and contract marriages and divorce. Noah Feldman, a law professor at Harvard University, notes:\n\nIn contrast to the Western world, during the 15th century and afterward, where divorce was relatively uncommon until modern times, divorce (\"talaq\") was a more common occurrence at certain points during that era in the Muslim world. In the Mamluk Sultanate and early Ottoman Empire, the rate of divorce was higher than it is today in the modern Middle East, at least according to one study. In 15th-century Egypt, Al-Sakhawi recorded the marital history of 500 women, the largest sample on marriage in the Middle Ages, and found that at least a third of all women in the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt and Syria married more than once, with many marrying three or more times.\n\nThe modern movement of Islamic feminism began in the nineteenth century. The Iranian poet Táhirih was the first modern woman to undertake Qur'anic exegesis. Born and raised in a traditional Muslim family, she would later become a prominent member of the Bábí Faith, during which time she openly denounced polygyny, the wearing of the veil and other restraints put upon women. One of her most notable quotes is her final utterance prior to her execution in August 1852, \"You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women.\"\n\nEgyptian jurist Qasim Amin, the author of the 1899 pioneering book \"Women's Liberation\" (\"Tahrir al-Mar'a\"), is often described as the father of the Egyptian feminist movement. In his work, Amin criticized some of the practices prevalent in his society at the time, such as polygyny, the veil, and \"purdah\", i.e. sex segregation in Islam. He condemned them as un-Islamic and contradictory to the true spirit of Islam. His work had an enormous influence on women's political movements throughout the Islamic and Arab world, and is read and cited today.\n\nDespite Qasim Amin's effects on modern-day Islamic feminist movements, present-day scholar Leila Ahmed considers his works both androcentric and colonialist. Muhammad 'Abdu, an Egyptian nationalist, could easily have written the chapters of his work that show honest considerations of the negative effects of the veil on women. Amin even posed many male-centered misconceptions about women, such as their inability to experience love, that women needlessly (when they had very good reason to) talk about their husbands outside their presence, and that Muslim marriage is based on ignorance and sensuality, of which women were the chief source.\n\nLess known, however, are the women who preceded Amin in their feminist critique of their societies. The women's press in Egypt started voicing such concerns since its very first issues in 1892. Egyptian, Turkish, Iranian, Syrian and Lebanese women and men had been reading European feminist magazines even a decade earlier, and discussed their relevance to the Middle East in the general press.\n\nAisha Abd al-Rahman, writing under her pen name \"Bint al-Shati\" (\"Daughter of the Riverbank\"), was the second modern woman to undertake Quranic exegesis, and though she did not consider herself to be a feminist, her works reflect feminist themes. She began producing her popular books in 1959, the same year that Naguib Mahfouz published his allegorical and feminist version of the life of Muhammad. She wrote biographies of early women in Islam, including the mother, wives and daughters of the Prophet Muhammad, as well as literary criticism. Fatema Mernissi has argued that much of the suppression of women's rights in Islamic societies is the result of political motivation and its consequent manipulative interpretation of hadith, which runs counter to the egalitarian Islamic community of men and women envisioned by Muhammed.\n\nSome strains of modern Islamic feminism have opted to expunge hadith from their ideology altogether in favor of a movement focusing only on Qur'anic principles. Riffat Hassan has advocated one such movement, articulating a theology wherein what are deemed to be universal rights for humanity outlined in the Qur'an are prioritized over contextual laws and regulations. She has additionally claimed that the Qur'an, taken alone as scripture, does not present females either as a creation preceded by the male or as the instigator of the \"Fall of Man\". This theological movement has been met with criticism from other Muslim feminists such as Kecia Ali, who has criticized its selective nature for ignoring elements within the Muslim tradition that could prove helpful in establishing more egalitarian norms in Islamic society.\n\nThe Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) is a women's organization based in Quetta, Pakistan, that promotes women's rights and secular democracy. The organization aims to involve women of Afghanistan in both political and social activities aimed at acquiring human rights for women and continuing the struggle against the government of Afghanistan based on democratic and secular, not fundamentalist principles, in which women can participate fully.\nThe organization was founded in 1977 by a group of intellectuals led by Meena (she did not use a last name). They founded the organization to promote equality and education for women and continues to \"give voice to the deprived and silenced women of Afghanistan\". In 1979 RAWA campaigned against DRA, and organized meetings in schools to mobilize support against it, and in 1981, launched a bilingual feminist magazine, \"Payam-e-Zan\" (Women's Message). RAWA also founded Watan Schools to aid refugee children and their mothers, offering both hospitalization and the teaching of practical skills. Meena was assassinated in Quetta, Pakistan on February 4, 1987 by Afghan agents of the Soviet KGB, who were colluding with fundamentalist Mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, for her political activities. Before 1978, RAWA focused mainly on women's rights and democracy, but after the coup of 1978, directed by Moscow, and the 1979 Soviet Occupation of Afghanistan, \"Rawa became directly involved in the war of resistance, advocating democracy and secularism from the outset\".\n\nIn 2015 a group of Muslim activists, politicians, and writers issued a Declaration of Reform which, among other things, supports women's rights and states in part, \"We support equal rights for women, including equal rights to inheritance, witness, work, mobility, personal law, education, and employment. Men and women have equal rights in mosques, boards, leadership and all spheres of society. We reject sexism and misogyny.\" The Declaration also announced the founding of the Muslim Reform Movement organization to work against the beliefs of Middle Eastern terror groups. In 2015 Asra Nomani and others placed the Declaration on the door of the Islamic Center of Washington. Feminism in the Middle East is over a century old, and having been impacted directly by the war on terror in Afghanistan, continues to grow and fight for women's rights and equality in all conversations of power and everyday life. There is currently an ongoing debate about the actual status of women in Islam, with both conservatives and Islamic feminists using the Quran, the hadith, and prominent women in Muslim history as evidence for the discussion on women's rights, with feminists arguing that early Islam represented more egalitarian ideals, while conservatives argue that gender asymmetries are \"divinely ordained\".\n\nSister-hood is an international platform for the voices of women of Muslim heritage founded in 2007 by Norwegian, film-maker and human rights activist Deeyah Khan through her media and arts production company Fuuse.\n\nSister-hood was relaunched in 2016 as a global online magazine and live events platform promoting the voices of women of Muslim heritage. Within six month of its relaunch as an online magazine, sister-hood won Espoke Living Best Website at the 2016 Asian Media Awards for highlighting female equality as well as creating awareness of issues affecting Muslim women. \nsister-hood magazine ambassadors include Farida Shaheed from Pakistan, Egyptian Mona Eltahawy, Palestinian Rula Jebreal, Leyla Hussein of Somali heritage and Algerian Marieme Helie Lucas.\n\nSisters in Islam (SIS) is a Malay civil society organisation committed to promoting the rights of women within the frameworks of Islam and universal human rights. SIS work focuses on challenging laws and policies made in the name of Islam that discriminate against women. As such it tackles issues covered under Malaysia's Islamic family and syariah laws, such as polygamy, child marriage, moral policing, Islamic legal theory and jurisprudence, the hijab and modesty, violence against women and hudud. Their mission is to promote the principles of gender equality, justice, freedom, and dignity of Islam and empower women to be advocates for change. They seek to promote a framework of women's rights in Islam which take into consideration women's experiences and realities; they want to eliminate the injustice and discrimination that women may face by changing mindsets that may hold women to be inferior to men; and they want to increase the public knowledge and reform laws and policies within the framework of justice and equality in Islam. Prominent members are Zainah Anwar, and co-founder Amina Wadud.\n\nIn September 2016, the group Muslim Women’s Quest for Equality petitioned the Supreme Court of India against the practices of \"talaq-e-bidat\" (triple talaq), \"nikah halala\" and polygyny under the Muslim personal laws illegal and unconstitutional. \n\nIn 2009, twelve women from the Arab world formed the global movement Musawah, whose name means \"equality\" in Arabic. Musawah advocates for feminist interpretations of Islamic texts and calls on nations to abide by international human rights standards such as those promulgated in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Musawah's approach is modeled after that of Sisters in Islam. Secular feminists have criticized Musawah, arguing that Islam is shaky ground on which to build a feminist movement, given that interpretation of Islamic sources is subjective.\n\nOne of the major areas of scholarship and campaigning for Islamic feminists are aspects of sharia (Islamic law) known as Muslim personal law (MPL) or Muslim family law. There is dispute that the use of \"sharia\" law is oppressive because they are based mainly on \"man-made misinterpretations of the sacred texts\" and are not based in Islam. Some of the thorny issues regarding the way in which MPL has thus far been formulated include polygyny, divorce, custody of children, maintenance and marital property. In addition, there are also more macro issues regarding the underlying assumptions of such legislation, for example, the assumption of the man as head of the household.\n\nMuslim majority countries that have promulgated some form of MPL include Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, Sudan, Senegal, Tunisia, Egypt, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. Muslim minority countries that already have incorporated MPL into their own law or are considering passing legislation on aspects of MPL include India, Israel, and South Africa.\n\nOne of such controversial interpretations involve passages in the Quran that discuss the idea of a man's religious obligation to support women. Some scholars, such as anthropologist Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban in her work on Arab-Muslim women activists' engagement in secular religious movements, argue that this assertion of a religious obligation \"has traditionally been used as a rationale for the social practice of male authority.\" In some countries the legislative and administrative application of male authority is used to justify denying women access to the public sphere through the \"denial of permission to travel or work outside the home, or even drive a car.\" On Sept. 26, 2017 Saudi Arabia announced it would end its longstanding policy banning women from driving in June 2018. Various female activists had protested the ban, among them Saudi women's rights activists Manal al-Sharif, by posting videos of them driving on social media platforms.\n\nIslamic feminists have objected to the MPL legislation in many of these countries, arguing that these pieces of legislation discriminate against women. Some Islamic feminists have taken the attitude that a reformed MPL which is based on the Quran and sunnah, which includes substantial input from Muslim women, and which does not discriminate against women is possible. Such Islamic feminists have been working on developing women-friendly forms of MPL. (See, for example, the Canadian Council of Muslim Women for argument based on the Qur'an and not on what they call medieval male consensus.) Other Islamic feminists, particularly some in Muslim minority contexts which are democratic states, argue that MPL should not be reformed but should be rejected and that Muslim women should seek redress, instead, from the civil laws of those states. \n\nAnother issue that concerns Muslim women is the dress code expected of them. Islam requires both men and women to dress modestly; this concept is known as \"hijab\" and covers a wide interpretation of behavior and garments. There is mixed opinion among Muslim feminists over extremes of externally imposed control. Modern Sufi groups such as Al-Ahbash, does not make it mandatory for Women to wear traditional Islamic clothing even allowing jeans.\n\nA number of Islamic feminists, including Fadela Amara and support bans on the \"hijab\" for various reasons. Amara explained her support for France's ban of the garment in public buildings: \"The veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women, and therefore has no place in the mixed, secular spaces of France's public school system.\" When some feminists began defending the headscarf on the grounds of \"tradition\", Amara was quoted as saying: \"It's not tradition, it's archaic! French feminists are totally contradictory. When Algerian women fought against wearing the headscarf in Algeria, French feminists supported them. But when it's some young girl in a French suburb school, they don't. They define liberty and equality according to what colour your skin is. It's nothing more than neocolonialism.\" Mhenni also expressed support for Tunisia's ban on the veil: \"If today we accept the headscarf, tomorrow we'll accept that women's rights to work and vote and receive an education be banned and they'll be seen as just a tool for reproduction and housework.\"\n\nSihem Habchi, Muslim feminist and director of Ni Putes Ni Soumises, expressed support for France's ban on the burqa in public places, stating that the ban was a matter of 'democratic principle' and protecting French women from the 'obscurantist, fascist, right-wing movement' that she claims the burqa represents.\n\nAlternatively, there is also strong support in favor of the veil. Both men and women now view the veil as a symbol of Islamic freedom. As a growing number of individuals have accepted and incorporated the hijab into their cultural dress, women are beginning to reclaim the meaning behind the veil. The veil itself acts as a different experience lived by each woman who wears a veil. “It is no longer a bandanna version of the all-encompassing Afghan burqa, signaling a woman's brainwashed submissiveness or at the very least her lack of choice”. Many scholars agree that there is no scripture that requires women to wear the hijab but many still do as an act of religious piety.\n\nA growing number of women have began to incorporate the hijab into their cultural dress, whether they live in predominantly Muslim countries or not. The veil itself acts as a different experience lived by each woman who wears it, rather than a homogenizing item of clothing. Over the past ten years, the hijab has become more prominent in countries of the world where wearing the hijab itself is not required of women by state law. The willingness to wear the veil outside of required states acts as a radical statement in some instances, in a way reclaiming the symbol and meaning of the veil. Where the veil once stereotypically represented the oppression of women, it now acts as a power statement of pride in religion, femininity, and sexual identity. Feminist philosophers such as Luce Irigaray also note that the veil can take on the role of empowerment regarding a women's sexual difference from man.\n\nThe Qur'an does state that both men and women should be dressed modestly (33:59-60, 24:30-31; in translation by Ali, 1988, 1126–27). However it does not use the words veil, hijab, burka, chador, or abaya. It uses the words \"jilbab\" meaning cloak and \"khumur\" meaning shawl. These do not cover the face, hands, or feet. Furthermore, until the third through the ninth century women prayed in the mosques unveiled. The whole body covering with the burka, chador, and other items of clothing is a tradition and cultural manifest from a conservative reading of the Qur'an by Mullahs; men. It is not what the Qur'an itself states.\n\nRachel Woodlock, an academic and writer specializing in Islam, has detailed in an article that the issue of wearing the veil depends on specific cultures along with cultural context. In addition, modern Muslim feminists believe that ultimately the importance lies in a woman's freedom of choice---her choice to wear the veil or not to, and not have her right to do so threatened. Muslim women should be able to define dress codes for themselves and what they deem to be morally right.\n\nIn her book \"Muslim Fashion: Contemporary Style Cultures\", London College of Fashion Cultural Studies professor Reina Lewis states that the evolution of mainstream hijab fashion serves as an outlet for Muslim women to demonstrate creativity and individuality in their development of a personal style that adheres to the code of dressing modestly. This gives Muslim women, particularly those of younger generations, the personal decision to wear the hijab is an opportunity to express their contemporary ideas on Muslim femininity.\n\nNot only is clothing modesty widely symbolic in Muslim communities and Islamic religious beliefs, but the method of head covering has many connections between religions as well. Reina Lewis discusses this connection of religious practices in her book, “\"Modest Fashion: Styling Bodies, Mediating Faith,\"” where she brings up the political divide between Jews and Muslims. Muslim headwear designer, Wegdan Hamza, was intrigued to find out the large appeal of her website to Orthodox Jewish Women. Hamza was born and raised in Egypt, and had been wearing a Hijab for her entire life. Hamza speaks out about how she was delighted that her designs had become of interest in interfaith modesty, since she sees head covering as \"a link between all the Holy religions\", which can further help to \"reduce anger between mankind\". The \"tichel\" is compared to the muslim \"hijab\" in Judaism, which is Yiddish for headscarf. According to the \"Encyclopedia of Judaism\", written by Sara E. Karesh, and Mitchell M. Hurvitz, the tichel is discussed in the Jewish laws of modesty as a required article of clothing worn by married women. There are many variations of the headscarf in Judaism, such as \"mitpachat\" in Hebrew, or \"shmateh\", all meaning the same thing. While they are called many different things in both Judaism and Islamic religions, they have many of the same rules, and coincide on many ideological levels.\n\nA survey by the Council on American Islamic Relations showed that two out of three mosques in 2000 required women to pray in a separate area, up from one out of two in 1994. Islamic feminists have begun to protest this, advocating for women to be allowed to pray beside men without a partition as they do in Mecca. In 2003, Asra Nomani challenged the rules at her mosque in Morgantown, West Virginia, that required women to enter through a back door and pray in a secluded balcony. She argued that in the 7th century the Islamic prophet Muhammad didn't put women behind partitions, and that barriers preventing women from praying equally with men are just sexist man-made rules. The men at her mosque put her on trial to be banished.\n\nAs of 2004 in the United States, some mosques have constitutions prohibiting women from voting in board elections.\n\nIn 2005, following public agitation on the issue, Muslim organizations that included the CAIR and the Islamic Society of North America issued a report on making mosques \"women-friendly\", to assert women's rights in mosques, and to include women's right to pray in the main hall without a partition.\n\nIn 2010, American Muslim Fatima Thompson and a few others organized and participated in a \"pray-in\" at the Islamic Center of Washington in D.C. Police were summoned and threatened to arrest the women when they refused to leave the main prayer hall. The women continued their protest against being corralled in what they referred to as the \"penalty box\" (a prayer space reserved for only women). Fatima Thompson called the penalty box \"an overheated, dark back room.\" A second protest also staged by the same group on the eve of International Women's Day in 2010 resulted in calls to the police and threats of arrest again. However, the women were not arrested on either occasion.\n\nFurthermore, in May 2010, five women prayed with men at the Dar al-Hijrah mosque, one of the Washington region's largest Islamic centers. After the prayers, a member of the mosque called Fairfax police who asked the women to leave. However, later in 2010, it was decided that D.C. police would no longer intervene in such protests.\n\nIn 2015 a group of Muslim activists, politicians, and writers issued a Declaration of Reform which states in part, \"Men and women have equal rights in mosques, boards, leadership and all spheres of society. We reject sexism and misogyny.\" That same year Asra Nomani and others placed the Declaration on the door of the Islamic Center of Washington.\n\nAccording to currently existing traditional schools of Islam, a woman cannot lead a mixed gender congregation in salat (prayer). Some schools make exceptions for Tarawih (optional Ramadan prayers) or for a congregation consisting only of close relatives. Certain medieval scholars—including Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari (838–923), Abu Thawr (764–854), Isma'il Ibn Yahya al-Muzani (791–878), and Ibn Arabi (1165–1240) considered the practice permissible at least for optional (\"nafl\") prayers; however, their views are not accepted by any major surviving group. Islamic feminists have begun to protest this.\n\nOn March 18, 2005, Amina Wadud led a mixed-gender congregational Friday prayer in New York City. It sparked a controversy within the Muslim community because the imam was a woman, Wadud, who also delivered the khutbah. Moreover, the congregation she addressed was not separated by gender. This event that departed from the established ritual practice became an embodied performance of gender justice in the eyes of its organizers and participants. The event was widely publicized in the global media and caused an equally global debate among Muslims. However, many Muslims, including women, remain in disagreement with the idea of a women as imam. Muzammil Siddiqi, chairman of the Fiqh Council of North America, argued that prayer leadership should remain restricted to men He based his argument on the longstanding practice and thus community consensus and emphasized the danger of women distracting men during prayers.\n\nThe events that occurred in regards to equality in the Mosque and women leading prayers, show the enmity Muslim feminists may receive when voicing opposition toward sexism and establishing efforts to combat it. Those who criticize Muslim feminists state that those who question the faith's views on gender segregation, or who attempt to make changes, are overstepping their boundaries and are acting offensively. On the other hand, people have stated that Islam does not advocate gender segregation. Britain's influential Sunni imam, Ahtsham Ali, has stated, \"gender segregation has no basis in Islamic law\" nor is it justified in the Quran.\n\nIn an article, “Woman Imam Leading Men and Women in Salat” written by Muzammil Siddiqi, he states that the reason women are not supposed to lead prayer is because “It is not permissible to introduce any new style or liturgy in Salat.” Siddiqi states that woman should not be leading prayer because it strays away from the tradition of men teaching. \n\nMargot Badran explains that Islamic feminism “derives its understanding and mandate from the Qur’an, seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in the totality of their existence.” She explains in her writings that the radicalization that Islamists (political Islam) have corrupted Islam with the image of patriarchy and oppression to women. This image is what the rest of the world sees and understands Islam to be.\nAsma Barlas, shares Badran’s views, discussing the difference between secular feminists and Islamic feminism and in countries where Muslims make up 98% of the population, it is not possible to avoid engaging “its basic beliefs.”\n\nIn an essay by Fatima Seedat, “Beyond the text,” Seedat agrees with both Barlas and Badran on their views about the importance of feminism in the Islamic world. However, she debates the term “Islamic Feminism” is unnecessary since feminism is a “social practice, not merely of personal identity.” Seedat believes the convergence of both Islamic and feminism creates more conflict and opens more doors for “Islamists” to interpret or misinterpret the Qur'an to suit their political needs. She believes it is important to speak about and illustrate how feminism has existed in the lines of the Qur'an. By separating the two and giving their own space, it will be more inclusive to everyone (men, women, Muslims and non-Muslims). In the same article, “Feminism, and Islamic Feminism: Between Inadequacy and Inevitability,” Seedat explains that the existence of such a term separates Muslims and Isolates them from the rest of the world and the universal feminist movement. She states in her essay the importance of sharing with the rest of the world what Islam has to offer feminism, and to show the true image of Islam by not referring to themselves as Islamic feminists.\n\nDr. Zakir Naik explains in the YouTube video, \"Are Men and Women Equal in Islam?\" that there is a difference between men and women in Islam as far as physical differences and their roles given by God. In the video, Dr. Naik compares Muslim women’s rights to non-Muslim women’s rights in the West, making points about how Muslim women are looked at as oppressed because they choose to wear hijab. However, he argues that women in the west or non-Muslim women are oppressed and lack many rights. In the video, Dr. Naik says, \"Islam believes in equality between men and women, but equality does not mean identicality.\" \n\nDr. Naik also mentions the scripture in the Quran that is dedicated to women, \"Surat elnisaa,\" meaning the scripture of women. The scripture talks about women and their rights as well as orphans and that God rewards those who look after and protect women and orphans (and children).\n\nDr. Naik also shares examples from the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, emphasizing \"the negativity of disobeying the mother more than the father,\" to show how just Islam is to women, and not oppressive as many people around the world think of Islam. He uses the example of separate sports teams rather than unisex. Women do not even play tennis unless each opposing couple is one male and one female. Tennis matches do not consist of two women against two men.\n\nKhawla bint al-Azwar, was a female Muslim warrior/soldier during the life of the prophet Mohammad. Her brother, Dhiraar al-Azwar, trained her to fight and she fought with him in many battles. It is said that it was not known that she was a female when in battle because all soldiers were dressed in loose clothing and wrapped themselves in cloth to protect themselves from the sand and dust. After proving herself as a soldier by showing her talent and skill in combat, she revealed herself to the men she fought next to. Since then, Khawla was essential to have in every battle that followed.\n\nIn Sahih Muslim, which is one of the books which include the teachings and traditions of the Prophet Muhammad. Abu Huraira (one of the Caliphates) reported that a person came to the Prophet and asked: “Who among the people is most deserving of a fine treatment from my hand? He said: Your mother. He again said: Then who (is the next one)? He said: Again it is your mother (who deserves the best treatment from you). He said: Then who (is the next one)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Again, it is your mother. He (again) said: Then who? Thereupon he said: Then it is your father.” This is one example that many scholars use to show the inclusion of women and their rights in the Quran/Islam.\n\nFrom the Quran: Surah 4:19\nO ye who believe! Ye are forbidden to inherit women against their will. Nor should ye treat them with harshness, that ye may Take away part of the dower ye have given them,-except where they have been guilty of open lewdness; on the contrary live with them on a footing of kindness and equity. If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of good. In this scripture it is explained by Sahih Muslim that this speaks to men to take care of their wives, and those who do not will suffer the consequences. Dr. Naik, in his video explains that this is not to give men a higher status than women, but to give them the role of caretaker because they(men) are created physically stronger than women. He stresses on the different roles they are given as men and women because of how God created them. Men are providers and women are the caregivers at home, given more patience, resilience, and the ability to forgive more than men.\n\n"}

Kumtepe has four layers, Kumtepe IA, IB, IC and II. The last two have been largely disturbed in the twentieth century. The remaining and relatively undisturbed IA and IB are of special interest to the archaeologists, because these are older than other settlements in the region.\n\nAround 4800 BC the first settlement in Kumtepe was founded. The inhabitants lived on fishing, and their diet included oysters. The dead were buried, but without grave gifts. Although Kumtepe belongs to Neolithic, the occupants used also copper. Around 4500 BC the settlement was abandoned.\n\nAround 3700 BC new settlers came to Kumtepe. The people of this new culture, Kumtepe B, built relatively large houses with multiple rooms, sometimes a porch. They also practiced animal husbandry and agriculture. The main domestic animals were goats and sheep, bred not only for meat but for milk and wool as well. They knew lead and bronze along with copper.

At the beginning of the series, Nanoha is a 9-year old schoolgirl in modern-day Japan, who is swept into a conflict between extra-dimensional powers vying for control over magical artifacts they had discovered on Earth. Nanoha herself is revealed to be tremendously powerful in the extra-dimensional techno-magic and in later installments, leaves Earth altogether to pursue a magical career. In the chronologically latest franchise entry, \"Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force\", she is 25. Nanoha's role has gradually diminished in the installments following \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS\", to the point where she only appears briefly in the 2016 anime \"ViVid Strike!\", which is set in the same universe but whose title no longer contains her name.\n\nNanoha Takamachi first appeared as a minor character in the eroge visual novel \"Triangle Heart 3\", released on December 8, 2000. She was first cast as a magical girl on a merchandise CD \"Triangle Heart 3 ~Lyrical Toy Box~\", released on June 29, 2001. Nanoha's first animated appearance was in the first episode of \"Triangle Heart 3\" OVA adaptation, released on July 24, 2003. All three titles, as well as the entire spin-off franchise starring Nanoha, were written by .\n\nIn the plot premise of the original series, \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha\" (2004), 21 \"Jewel Seeds\", highly destructive artifacts from another dimension, are accidentally scattered across Earth. After Nanoha assists an injured extradimensional magician in collecting them, she is drawn into a magical battle against a female mage named Fate Testarossa, who came to Earth to collect Jewel Seeds for her mother Precia. Attracted by their activity, the interdimensional police TSAB (\"Time-Space Administration Bureau\") intervenes to secure and to seal the artifacts. In the end, Nanoha convinces Fate to rebel against Precia, who is defeated and apparently dies.\n\nIn \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's\" (2005), Nanoha continues her magical training. Six months after the original series, she and Fate encounter the \"Wolkenritter\", four magic knights who steal others' magical abilities to save Hayate Yagami, a wheelchair-using Japanese girl. Since the Wolkenritter are skilled in Ancient Belkan combat magic far superior to theirs, Nanoha and Fate fail to stop them and the Book of Darkness, an ancient artifact bound to Hayate, is activated. A worldwide catastrophe is only prevented thanks to TSAB and most importantly, Hayate's intervention. In the following years, all primary characters leave Earth to pursue magical careers in the TSAB homeworld Midchilda.\n\n\"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS\" (2007) takes place ten years after \"A's\" and is set on Midchilda. Hayate, now a Lieutenant Colonel of TSAB, forms a special Riot Force 6 to counter the impending terrorist crisis organized by Dr. Scaglietti, a former colleague and accomplice of Precia Testarossa, and his combat cyborgs (\"Numbers\"). Nanoha, Fate, and the Wolkenritter join the unit, along with four young mages whom they personally train (\"Forwards\"). Despite their preparations, the unit fails to protect Vivio, a girl targeted by Scaglietti and adopted by Nanoha, and the crisis strikes in full force, stopped in the nick of time by Riot Force 6's heroic efforts. The unit is then dissolved, with its members returning to their original posts.\n\nA Drama CD titled \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS Sound Stage X\" (2008) is set three years after the Jail Scaglietti Incident. It features the characters first introduced in \"StrikerS\", mainly the Forwards and the Numbers, investigating a serial murder case on Midchilda. Their investigation eventually leads them to the , semi-sentient humanoid weapons from the Ancient Belkan era, and their elusive creator, Dark King Ixpellia.\n\nVivio's story is continued in the manga \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid\" (2009-2017), which is set four years after \"StrikerS\". Vivio now attends a magical academy on Midchilda, where she meets Einhart Stratos, another descendant of the Ancient Belkan royalty. Together with their friends, the two of them participate in the Inter-Middle, a magical combat tournament for young mages. A spin-off anime series, \"ViVid Strike!\" (2016), stars a teen magical martial artist Fuka Reventon, who trains under Einhart for a rematch against her estranged childhood friend, Rinne Berlinetta.\n\nAnother manga, \"Magical Record Lyrical Nanoha Force\" (2009-2013, on hiatus), set six years after \"StrikerS\", focuses on a new protagonist, Thoma Avenir. After Thoma rescues a mute girl named Lily Strosek on remote world, he unwittingly becomes a fugitive from TSAB. The ex-members of Riot Force 6 join forces once again to avert a new crisis caused by dangerous Ancient Belkan legacy, the Book of the Silver Cross, to which Lily is apparently connected, and the Hückebein family, an interdimensional terrorist cell with sights on Thoma.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable video game \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's Portable: The Battle of Aces\" (2010) is set in an alternate timeline which diverges from the main series at the end of the second anime series. In it, Nanoha and Fate refuse to seal Reinforce, allowing the Book of Darkness to regenerate its defenses and use the heroes' own dark clones to attack them. In the sequel, \"The Gears of Destiny\" (2011), the heroines must battle time-traveling humanoid Gears for the future of their respective worlds, and even meet characters from the future (of the main timeline).\n\nThe first two theatric movies were largely faithful adaptations of the first two anime seasons, but starting with \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Reflection\" (2017), the movies' continuity sharply diverged from the main one by cross-introducing the time-traveling Gears (who are human in this continuity) to the Earth after Reinforce had been sealed. \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Detonation\" (2018) is expected to finish the story arc started in \"Reflection\".\n\n\"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Innocent\" (2012-2014) is a spin-off manga series set in a universe parallel to the main franchise, where the main characters are ordinary girls who battle each other in a magical card game called \"Brave Duel\". A follow-up sequel manga, \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Innocents\" (2014-2016), featuring younger Subaru and Teana began publication after the first spin-off ended.\n\nTo date, there have been three anime television series produced by Seven Arcs. The first series, \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha\", aired in Japan between October and December 2004. The second series, \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha A's\", aired between October and December 2005. The third series, \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS\", aired between April and September 2007. The first two series were licensed in North America by Geneon and distributed by Funimation Entertainment. A theatrical retelling of the first series, \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha The Movie 1st\", was released in theaters on January 23, 2010, with an adaptation of the second series, \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha The Movie 2nd A's\", released on July 14, 2012. The third and fourth movies, \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Reflection\" and \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha Detonation\", released in 2017 and 2018, are based on an original story. \"Reflection\" was released on July 22, 2017 while \"Detonation\" will be released on October 19, 2018. An anime television adaptation of the \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha ViVid\" manga series aired between April and June 2015, and was produced by A-1 Pictures. In 2016, a new original anime was released, \"ViVid Strike!\", once again animated by Seven Arcs, which focuses on new original characters, Fuka and Rinne.\n\n\"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha\" novel is an adaptation of the first season, while the \"A's\" manga and \"StrikerS THE COMICS\" are collections of short side-stories expanding the respective anime series. \"ViVid\" and \"Force\" are standalone, independent story arcs that take place several years after the events of \"StrikerS\". \"The MOVIE 1st\" manga, similar to the \"A's\" and \"StrikerS\" manga series, expand on the storyline of the movie. \"Innocent\" is set in a parallel world to the main franchise.\n\nTwo fighting games based on \"A's\" were released by Namco Bandai Games for PlayStation Portable in January 2010 and December 2011 respectively. Characters from the \"Nanoha\" franchise appear in the crossover role-playing game, \"Nendoroid Generation\", which is based on the Nendoroid series of figures.\n\nThe franchise takes an innovative approach to the magical girl genre, focusing much more on combat whereas typical titles focus more on characterization, as well as being targeted at a male demographic. ICv2 praised the \"Nanoha\" franchise for taking a more serious approach to social issues such as child abuse than other magical girl anime.\n\nJohn Oppliger, an analyst for AnimeNation, identified two ways in which the \"Lyrical Nanoha\" franchise deviates from the magical girl genre conventions: the tone and feel of the conflict and the presentation of its central heroine, Nanoha Takamachi. About the former, he observed that although another magical girl series, \"Futari wa Pretty Cure\", preceded the first \"Lyrical Nanoha\" anime by six months in introducing an unprecedented amount of violence to the genre, the fights in \"Pretty Cure\" were still strongly tied to the emotional state and drama of their participants. Whereas in \"Nanoha\", the battles are akin to \"magical gunfights\"; they appear objective, mechanical, and deadly and are inspired more by the science fiction and mecha genres than by the traditional magical girl conflicts. Regarding the latter, Oppliger described the show as trying to evoke sympathy for Nanoha Takamachi instead of empathy, i.e. \"Nanoha\" presents its heroine from an external point of view to make the audience feel for her but not want to be her or to be like her, as other magical girl series do. Such perspective is, according to Oppliger, \"used for conventional otaku anime\" and makes the anime more accessible to the older male demographic.\n\n"}
{"id": "19947", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19947", "title": "Mannerism", "text": "Mannerism\n\nMannerism, also known as Late Renaissance, is a style in European art that emerged in the later years of the Italian High Renaissance around 1520, spreading by about 1530 and lasting until about the end of the 16th century in Italy, when the Baroque style largely replaced it. Northern Mannerism continued into the early 17th century.\n\nStylistically, Mannerism encompasses a variety of approaches influenced by, and reacting to, the harmonious ideals associated with artists such as Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and early Michelangelo. Where High Renaissance art emphasizes proportion, balance, and ideal beauty, Mannerism exaggerates such qualities, often resulting in compositions that are asymmetrical or unnaturally elegant. The style is notable for its intellectual sophistication as well as its artificial (as opposed to naturalistic) qualities. It favors compositional tension and instability rather than the balance and clarity of earlier Renaissance painting. Mannerism in literature and music is notable for its highly florid style and intellectual sophistication.\n\nThe definition of Mannerism and the phases within it continue to be a subject of debate among art historians. For example, some scholars have applied the label to certain early modern forms of literature (especially poetry) and music of the 16th and 17th centuries. The term is also used to refer to some late Gothic painters working in northern Europe from about 1500 to 1530, especially the Antwerp Mannerists—a group unrelated to the Italian movement. Mannerism has also been applied by analogy to the Silver Age of Latin literature.\n\nThe word \"mannerism\" derives from the Italian \"maniera\", meaning \"style\" or \"manner\". Like the English word \"style\", \"maniera\" can either indicate a specific type of style (a beautiful style, an abrasive style) or indicate an absolute that needs no qualification (someone \"has style\"). In the second edition of his \"Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\" (1568), Giorgio Vasari used \"maniera\" in three different contexts: to discuss an artist's manner or method of working; to describe a personal or group style, such as the term \"maniera greca\" to refer to the Byzantine style or simply to the \"maniera\" of Michelangelo; and to affirm a positive judgment of artistic quality. Vasari was also a Mannerist artist, and he described the period in which he worked as \"la maniera moderna\", or the \"modern style\". James V. Mirollo describes how \"bella maniera\" poets attempted to surpass in virtuosity the sonnets of Petrarch. This notion of \"bella maniera\" suggests that artists who were thus inspired looked to copying and bettering their predecessors, rather than confronting nature directly. In essence, \"bella maniera\" utilized the best from a number of source materials, synthesizing it into something new.\n\nAs a stylistic label, \"Mannerism\" is not easily defined. It was used by Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt and popularized by German art historians in the early 20th century to categorize the seemingly uncategorizable art of the Italian 16th century — art that was no longer found to exhibit the harmonious and rational approaches associated with the High Renaissance. “High Renaissance” connoted a period distinguished by harmony, grandeur and the revival of classical antiquity. The term Mannerist was redefined in 1967 by John Shearman following the exhibition of Mannerist paintings organised by Fritz Grossmann at Manchester City Art Gallery in 1965. The label “Mannerism” was used during the 16th century to comment on social behaviour and to convey a refined virtuoso quality or to signify a certain technique.\nHowever, for later writers, such as the 17th-century Gian Pietro Bellori, \"la maniera\" was a derogatory term for the perceived decline of art after Raphael, especially in the 1530s and 1540s. From the late 19th century on, art historians have commonly used the term to describe art that follows Renaissance classicism and precedes the Baroque.\n\nYet historians differ as to whether Mannerism is a style, a movement, or a period; and while the term remains controversial it is still commonly used to identify European art and culture of the 16th century.\n\nBy the end of the High Renaissance, young artists experienced a crisis: it seemed that everything that could be achieved was already achieved. No more difficulties, technical or otherwise, remained to be solved. The detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, physiognomy and the way in which humans register emotion in expression and gesture, the innovative use of the human form in figurative composition, the use of the subtle gradation of tone, all had reached near perfection. The young artists needed to find a new goal, and they sought new approaches. At this point Mannerism started to emerge. The new style developed between 1510 and 1520 either in Florence, or in Rome, or in both cities simultaneously.\n\nThis period has been described as a \"natural extension\" of the art of Andrea del Sarto, Michelangelo, and Raphael. Michelangelo developed his own style at an early age, a deeply original one which was greatly admired at first, then often copied and imitated by other artists of the era. One of the qualities most admired by his contemporaries was his \"terribilità\", a sense of awe-inspiring grandeur, and subsequent artists attempted to imitate it. Other artists learned Michelangelo's impassioned and highly personal style by copying the works of the master, a standard way that students learned to paint and sculpt. His Sistine Chapel ceiling provided examples for them to follow, in particular his representation of collected figures often called \"ignudi\" and of the Libyan Sibyl, his vestibule to the Laurentian Library, the figures on his Medici tombs, and above all his \"Last Judgment\". The later Michelangelo was one of the great role models of Mannerism. Young artists broke in to his house and stole drawings from him. In his book \"Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects\", Giorgio Vasari noted that Michelangelo stated once: \"Those who are followers can never pass by whom they follow\".\n\nThe competitive spirit was cultivated by patrons who encouraged sponsored artists to emphasize virtuosic technique and to compete with one another for commissions. It drove artists to look for new approaches and dramatically illuminated scenes, elaborate clothes and compositions, elongated proportions, highly stylized poses, and a lack of clear perspective. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were each given a commission by Gonfaloniere Piero Soderini to decorate a wall in the Hall of Five Hundred in Florence. These two artists were set to paint side by side and compete against each other, fueling the incentive to be as innovative as possible.\n\nThe early Mannerists in Florence—especially the students of Andrea del Sarto such as Jacopo da Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino who are notable for elongated forms, precariously balanced poses, a collapsed perspective, irrational settings, and theatrical lighting. Parmigianino (a student of Correggio) and Giulio Romano (Raphael’s head assistant) were moving in similarly stylized aesthetic directions in Rome. These artists had matured under the influence of the High Renaissance, and their style has been characterized as a reaction to or exaggerated extension of it. Instead of studying nature directly, younger artists began studying Hellenistic sculpture and paintings of masters past. Therefore, this style is often identified as \"anti-classical”, yet at the time it was considered a natural progression from the High Renaissance. The earliest experimental phase of Mannerism, known for its \"anti-classical\" forms, lasted until about 1540 or 1550. Marcia B. Hall, professor of art history at Temple University, notes in her book \"After Raphael\" that Raphael's premature death marked the beginning of Mannerism in Rome.\n\nIn past analyses, it has been noted that mannerism arose in the early 16th century contemporaneously with a number of other social, scientific, religious and political movements such as the Copernican model, the Sack of Rome, and the Protestant Reformation's increasing challenge to the power of the Catholic Church. Because of this, the style's elongated forms and distorted forms were once interpreted as a reaction to the idealized compositions prevalent in High Renaissance art. This explanation for the radical stylistic shift c. 1520 has fallen out of scholarly favor, though early Mannerist art is still sharply contrasted with High Renaissance conventions; the accessibility and balance achieved by Raphael's \"School of Athens\" no longer seemed to interest young artists.\n\nThe second period of Mannerism is commonly differentiated from the earlier, so-called \"anti-classical\" phase.\nSubsequent mannerists stressed intellectual conceits and artistic virtuosity, features that have led later critics to accuse them of working in an unnatural and affected \"manner\" (\"maniera\"). Maniera artists looked to their older contemporary Michelangelo as their principal model; theirs was an art imitating art, rather than an art imitating nature. Art historian Sydney Joseph Freedberg argues that the intellectualizing aspect of maniera art involves expecting its audience to notice and appreciate this visual reference—a familiar figure in an unfamiliar setting enclosed between \"unseen, but felt, quotation marks\". The height of artifice is the Maniera painter's penchant for deliberately misappropriating a quotation. Agnolo Bronzino and Giorgio Vasari exemplify this strain of Maniera that lasted from about 1530 to 1580. Based largely at courts and in intellectual circles around Europe, Maniera art couples exaggerated elegance with exquisite attention to surface and detail: porcelain-skinned figures recline in an even, tempered light, acknowledging the viewer with a cool glance, if they make eye contact at all. The Maniera subject rarely displays much emotion, and for this reason works exemplifying this trend are often called 'cold' or 'aloof.' This is typical of the so-called \"stylish style\" or \"Maniera\" in its maturity.\n\nThe cities Rome, Florence, and Mantua were Mannerist centers in Italy. Venetian painting pursued a different course, represented by Titian in his long career. A number of the earliest Mannerist artists who had been working in Rome during the 1520s fled the city after the Sack of Rome in 1527. As they spread out across the continent in search of employment, their style was disseminated throughout Italy and Northern Europe. The result was the first international artistic style since the Gothic. Other parts of Northern Europe did not have the advantage of such direct contact with Italian artists, but the Mannerist style made its presence felt through prints and illustrated books. European rulers, among others, purchased Italian works, while northern European artists continued to travel to Italy, helping to spread the Mannerist style. Individual Italian artists working in the North gave birth to a movement known as the Northern Mannerism. Francis I of France, for example, was presented with Bronzino's \"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time\". The style waned in Italy after 1580, as a new generation of artists, including the Carracci brothers, Caravaggio and Cigoli, revived naturalism. Walter Friedlaender identified this period as \"anti-mannerism\", just as the early mannerists were \"anti-classical\" in their reaction away from the aesthetic values of the High Renaissance and today the Carracci brothers and Caravaggio are agreed to have begun the transition to Baroque-style painting which was dominant by 1600.\n\nOutside of Italy, however, Mannerism continued into the 17th century. In France, where Rosso traveled to work for the court at Fontainebleau, it is known as the \"Henry II style\" and had a particular impact on architecture. Other important continental centers of Northern Mannerism include the court of Rudolf II in Prague, as well as Haarlem and Antwerp. Mannerism as a stylistic category is less frequently applied to English visual and decorative arts, where native labels such as \"Elizabethan\" and \"Jacobean\" are more commonly applied. Seventeenth-century Artisan Mannerism is one exception, applied to architecture that relies on pattern books rather than on existing precedents in Continental Europe.\n\nOf particular note is the Flemish influence at Fontainebleau that combined the eroticism of the French style with an early version of the vanitas tradition that would dominate seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish painting. Prevalent at this time was the \"pittore vago,\" a description of painters from the north who entered the workshops in France and Italy to create a truly international style.\n\nAs in painting, early Italian Mannerist sculpture was very largely an attempt to find an original style that would top the achievement of the High Renaissance, which in sculpture essentially meant Michelangelo, and much of the struggle to achieve this was played out in commissions to fill other places in the Piazza della Signoria in Florence, next to Michelangelo's \"David\". Baccio Bandinelli took over the project of \"Hercules and Cacus\" from the master himself, but it was little more popular then than it is now, and maliciously compared by Benvenuto Cellini to \"a sack of melons\", though it had a long-lasting effect in apparently introducing relief panels on the pedestal of statues. Like other works of his and other Mannerists it removes far more of the original block than Michelangelo would have done. Cellini's bronze \"Perseus with the head of Medusa\" is certainly a masterpiece, designed with eight angles of view, another Mannerist characteristic, and artificially stylized in comparison with the \"David\"s of Michelangelo and Donatello. Originally a goldsmith, his famous gold and enamel Salt Cellar (1543) was his first sculpture, and shows his talent at its best.\n\nSmall bronze figures for collector's cabinets, often mythological subjects with nudes, were a popular Renaissance form at which Giambologna, originally Flemish but based in Florence, excelled in the later part of the century. He also created life-size sculptures, of which two entered the collection in the Piazza della Signoria. He and his followers devised elegant elongated examples of the \"figura serpentinata\", often of two intertwined figures, that were interesting from all angles.\n\nGiorgio Vasari's opinions about the art of painting emerge in the praise he bestows on fellow artists in his multi-volume \"Lives of the Artists\": he believed that excellence in painting demanded refinement, richness of invention (\"invenzione\"), expressed through virtuoso technique (\"maniera\"), and wit and study that appeared in the finished work, all criteria that emphasized the artist's intellect and the patron's sensibility. The artist was now no longer just a trained member of a local Guild of St Luke. Now he took his place at court alongside scholars, poets, and humanists, in a climate that fostered an appreciation for elegance and complexity. The coat-of-arms of Vasari's Medici patrons appears at the top of his portrait, quite as if it were the artist's own. The framing of the woodcut image of Vasari's \"Lives of the Artists\" would be called \"Jacobean\" in an English-speaking milieu. In it, Michelangelo's Medici tombs inspire the anti-architectural \"architectural\" features at the top, the papery pierced frame, the satyr nudes at the base. As a mere frame it is extravagant: Mannerist, in short.\n\nAnother literary figure from the period is Gian Paolo Lomazzo, who produced two works—one practical and one metaphysical—that helped define the Mannerist artist's self-conscious relation to his art. His \"Trattato dell'arte della pittura, scoltura et architettura\" (Milan, 1584) is in part a guide to contemporary concepts of decorum, which the Renaissance inherited in part from Antiquity but Mannerism elaborated upon. Lomazzo's systematic codification of aesthetics, which typifies the more formalized and academic approaches typical of the later 16th century, emphasized a consonance between the functions of interiors and the kinds of painted and sculpted decors that would be suitable. Iconography, often convoluted and abstruse, is a more prominent element in the Mannerist styles. His less practical and more metaphysical \"Idea del tempio della pittura\" (\"The ideal temple of painting\", Milan, 1590) offers a description along the lines of the \"four temperaments\" theory of human nature and personality, defining the role of individuality in judgment and artistic invention.\n\nJacopo da Pontormo's \"Joseph in Egypt\" features what would in the Renaissance have been considered incongruous colors and an incoherent handling of time and space.\n\nRosso Fiorentino, who had been a fellow pupil of Pontormo in the studio of Andrea del Sarto, in 1530 brought Florentine mannerism to Fontainebleau, where he became one of the founders of French 16th-century Mannerism, popularly known as the \"School of Fontainebleau\".\n\nThe examples of a rich and hectic decorative style at Fontainebleau further disseminated the Italian style through the medium of engravings, to Antwerp and from there throughout Northern Europe from London to Poland. Mannerist design was extended to luxury goods like silver and carved furniture. A sense of tense, controlled emotion expressed in elaborate symbolism and allegory, and an ideal of female beauty characterized by elongated proportions are features of this style.\n\nMannerist portraits by Agnolo Bronzino are distinguished by a serene elegance and meticulous attention to detail. As a result, Bronzino's sitters have been said to project an aloofness and marked emotional distance from the viewer. There is also a virtuosic concentration on capturing the precise pattern and sheen of rich textiles.\n\nAlessandro Allori's (1535–1607) \"Susanna and the Elders\" (\"below\") is distinguished by latent eroticism and consciously brilliant still life detail, in a crowded, contorted composition.\n\nTintoretto's \"Last Supper\" (below) focuses on light and motion, bringing the image to dramatic life. Unlike more traditional views of the Last Supper, Tintoretto depicts Heaven opening up into the room, and the angels looking on in awe, in line with the old Catholic maxim that \"If the angels were capable of envy, they would envy the Eucharist.\"\n\nEl Greco attempted to express religious emotion with exaggerated traits. After the realistic depiction of the human form and the mastery of perspective achieved in high Renaissance Classicism, some artists started to deliberately distort proportions in disjointed, irrational space for emotional and artistic effect. El Greco still is a deeply original artist. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. Key aspects of Mannerism in El Greco include the jarring \"acid\" palette, elongated and tortured anatomy, irrational perspective and light, and obscure and troubling iconography.\n\nBenvenuto Cellini created the Cellini Salt Cellar of gold and enamel in 1540 featuring Poseidon and Amphitrite (water and earth) placed in uncomfortable positions and with elongated proportions. It is considered a masterpiece of Mannerist sculpture.\n\nJoachim Wtewael (1566–1638) continued to paint in a Northern Mannerist style until the end of his life, ignoring the arrival of the Baroque, and making him perhaps the last significant Mannerist artist still to be working. His subjects included large scenes with still life in the manner of Pieter Aertsen, and mythological scenes, many small cabinet paintings beautifully executed on copper, and most featuring nudity.\n\nGiuseppe Arcimboldo (also spelled \"Arcimboldi\") is known for his portraits contrived from a still life composition\n\nMannerist architecture was characterized by visual trickery and unexpected elements that challenged the renaissance norms. Flemish artists, many of whom had traveled to Italy and were influenced by Mannerist developments there, were responsible for the spread of Mannerist trends into Europe north of the Alps, including into the realm of architecture. During the period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style, and a pioneer at the Laurentian Library, was Michelangelo (1475–1564). He is credited with inventing the giant order, a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade. He used this in his design for the Campidoglio in Rome.\n\nPrior to the 20th century, the term \"Mannerism\" had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgmental terms. Mannerist architecture has also been used to describe a trend in the 1960s and 1970s that involved breaking the norms of modernist architecture while at the same time recognizing their existence. Defining mannerist in this context, architect and author Robert Venturi wrote \"Mannerism for architecture of our time that acknowledges conventional order rather than original expression but breaks the conventional order to accommodate complexity and contradiction and thereby engages ambiguity unambiguously.\" \n\nAn example of mannerist architecture is the Villa Farnese at Caprarola. in the rugged country side outside of Rome. The proliferation of engravers during the 16th century spread Mannerist styles more quickly than any previous styles.\n\nDense with ornament of \"Roman\" detailing, the display doorway at Colditz Castle exemplifies this northern style, characteristically applied as an isolated \"set piece\" against unpretentious vernacular walling.\n\nFrom the late 1560s onwards, many buildings in Valletta, the new capital city of Malta, were designed by the architect Girolamo Cassar in the Mannerist style. Such buildings include St. John's Co-Cathedral, the Grandmaster's Palace and the seven original auberges. Many of Cassar's buildings were modified over the years, especially in the Baroque period. However, a few buildings, such as Auberge d'Aragon and the exterior of St. John's Co-Cathedral, still retain most of Cassar's original Mannerist design.\n\nIn English literature, Mannerism is commonly identified with the qualities of the \"Metaphysical\" poets of whom the most famous is John Donne. The witty sally of a Baroque writer, John Dryden, against the verse of Donne in the previous generation, affords a concise contrast between Baroque and Mannerist aims in the arts:\n\nThe rich musical possibilities in the poetry of the late 16th and early 17th centuries provided an attractive basis for the madrigal, which quickly rose to prominence as the pre-eminent musical form in Italian musical culture, as discussed by Tim Carter:\n\nThe word Mannerism has also been used to describe the style of highly florid and contrapuntally complex polyphonic music made in France in the late 14th century. This period is now usually referred to as the \"ars subtilior\".\n\n\"The Early Commedia dell'Arte (1550–1621): The Mannerist Context\" by Paul Castagno discusses Mannerism's effect on the contemporary professional theatre. Castagno's was the first study to define a theatrical form as Mannerist, employing the vocabulary of Mannerism and maniera to discuss the typification, exaggerated, and effetto meraviglioso of the comici dell'arte. See Part II of the above book for a full discussion of Mannerist characteristics in the commedia dell'arte. The study is largely iconographic, presenting a pictorial evidence that many of the artists who painted or printed commedia images were in fact, coming from the workshops of the day, heavily ensconced in the maniera tradition.\n\nThe preciosity in Jacques Callot's minute engravings seem to belie a much larger scale of action. Callot's \"Balli di Sfessania\" (literally, dance of the buttocks) celebrates the commedia's blatant eroticism, with protruding phalli, spears posed with the anticipation of a comic ream, and grossly exaggerated masks that mix the bestial with human. The eroticism of the innamorate (lovers) including the baring of breasts, or excessive veiling, was quite in vogue in the paintings and engravings from the second school at Fontainebleau, particularly those that detect a Franco-Flemish influence. Castagno demonstrates iconographic linkages between genre painting and the figures of the commedia dell'arte that demonstrate how this theatrical form was embedded within the cultural traditions of the late cinquecento.\n\nImportant corollaries exist between the \"disegno interno\", which substituted for the \"disegno esterno\" (external design) in mannerist painting. This notion of projecting a deeply subjective view as superseding nature or established principles (perspective, for example), in essence, the emphasis away from the object to its subject, now emphasizing execution, displays of virtuosity, or unique techniques. This inner vision is at the heart of commedia performance. For example, in the moment of improvisation the actor expresses his virtuosity without heed to formal boundaries, decorum, unity, or text. Arlecchino became emblematic of the mannerist \"discordia concors\" (the union of opposites), at one moment he would be gentle and kind, then, on a dime, become a thief violently acting out with his batte. Arlecchino could be graceful in movement, only in the next beat, to clumsily trip over his feet. Freed from the external rules, the actor celebrated the evanescence of the moment; much the way Cellini would dazzle his patrons by draping his sculptures, unveiling them with lighting effects and a sense of the marvelous. The presentation of the object became as important as the object itself.\n\nAccording to art critic Jerry Saltz, \"Neo-Mannerism\" (new Mannerism) is among several clichés that are \"squeezing the life out of the art world\". Neo-Mannerism describes art of the 21st century that is turned out by students whose academic teachers \"have scared [them] into being pleasingly meek, imitative, and ordinary\".\n\n\n"}

He has often been described as a ‘choreographer of letters.'\n\nNja Mahdaoui was born in Tunis, Tunisia in 1937.\nHe initially studied painting and art history at Carthage National Museum,\nbut was later, encouraged by the Director of the Italian Cultural Centre in Tunis, studied painting and philosophy at the Santa Andrea Academy in Rome (1966-68). \nHe later moved to Paris to go to Cité Internationale des Arts, where he attended courses at the École du Louvre.\nMahdaoui returned to Tunisia in 1977 and currently lives and works there.\n\nMahdaoui began his career as an abstract painter in the 1960s, then continued by experimenting with Arabic calligraphy.\nMahdaoui has tried various traditional and experimental media. He produced his first paintings on parchment in 1972, he became interested in weaving and carpet production in 1979 and he began to paint on animal skins and on the human body in 1980.\nToday he is known as the \"inventor of abstract calligraphy,\" since his designs resemble Arabic letters, but have no literal meaning. When asked about his style Mahdaoui said, \"I use fragmented and distorted letters to reject valuing each character.\" \nHe started using his own personal 'calligrams' on various mediums such as: canvas, papyrus, sculpture, aluminum, brass, drum, textile, embroidery, tapestry, ceramic, wood, jewelry, stained steel glass, planes, etc. On account of his use of calligraphy in art, he is said to be part of the Hurufiyah art movement.\n\nMahdaoui is of a generation of Arab artists who studied abroad but sought inspiration from their traditional roots. Mahdaoui focused on the poetic quality of Arabic text, and invented a graphic style involving calligraphic works. Rose Issa, a curator, has described his work saying, \"Mahdaoui is careful not to emphasize the meaning of words but stresses instead the visual effect of compositions. His 'calligrams evoke infinite pleasures in rhythms, fast or slow, born from tension of the wrist, somewhat in the manner of a melodic flow, rising and fading away\".\n\nIn 2000, he was also selected by Gulf Air to design the external decoration of its fleet for the airline's fiftieth anniversary. He has also created monumental stained-glass windows for public buildings in the United Arab Emirates. \nMahdaoui followed his love of music, costume, and performance by using different media to apply his 'calligrams' to a wide range of objects such as large denim hangings, musicians' costumes, and a bass drum.\nThe bass drum was created in 1998 with wood and given calligraphic embellishments by Mahdaoui. When asked about this piece Mahdaoui said,\"This drum, transformed into a silent sculpture, has temporarily ceased to be an instrument; it simply exists. Its cultural function - as a catalyst to the senses articulated through formal and improvised melody - has been interrupted. More importantly, it has renounced its particular voice as part of a collective artistic performance. Instead, with its multiplicity of resonances, it has become a dynamic symbol of cultural pluralism, a kind of 'total art' to which people throughout the world can respond in a myriad different ways.\"\n\nMahdaoui has participated in both solo and group exhibitions worldwide.

He was a significant benefactor to the British Museum.\n\nMorgan was born on 15 September 1803. He was the fourth son of Sir Charles Morgan, 2nd Baronet, of Tredegar Park, Monmouthshire, by his wife Mary (née Stoney). Charles Rodney Morgan and Charles Morgan, 1st Baron Tredegar, were his elder brothers. He was educated at Westminster School in London and at Christ Church, Oxford, gaining an M.A. in 1832.\n\nMorgan was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, a Fellow of the Royal Society and the President of the Royal Archaeological Institute. In 1832 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.\n\nMorgan had inherited an ample fortune and in 1839 he had \"The Friars\" rebuilt for his use in the Elizabethan style. The Friars had at one time been home to Carmelite monks. He was said to have filled the house with \"Tudor furniture, more curious than useful\". Morgan had an octagonal preaching platform installed halfway up the main wooden staircase where he would conduct services every day. His congregation would consist of his maids, the housekeeper, bailiff and the boot boy. The lock he had installed on the door reflected his interest in mechanisms and automata. The substantial brass lock is still on the door of his house and it has seven subsidiary controls.\n\nMorgan sat as Member of Parliament for Monmouthshire from 1841 to 1874 for the Conservatives. He also served as a Justice of the Peace and Deputy Lieutenant for Monmouthshire. He was President of the Cambrian Archaeological Association 1857–8.\nHe had been elected to Society of Antiquaries but was not active until 1848 after which he was Vice-President more than once. Morgan published papers on astrolabes and episcopal rings and early communion plate.\n\nIn 1852 Morgan published a series of papers in the Archaeological Journal about the assay and hallmarking of gold and silver, the first information that had been made public on this ancient practice. These sparked public interest in studying and collecting old gold and silver because of the information about its date and origins that can be discovered from the hallmarks.\n\nIn 1872 he published a valuable guide to the monuments in the Priory Church of St Mary in Abergavenny.\nDuring his lifetime Morgan made a number of generous donations to the British Museum including a nef, an extravagant table ornament automaton known as the Mechanical Galleon in 1866.\n\nMorgan never married and died on 5 August 1888 aged 84. He was buried in his family's vault at St Basil's Church at Bassaleg in Monmouthshire. He left his clock collection, astronomical instruments and episcopal rings. His astrolabes included the 14th-century astrolabe used to call the faithful to prayer in Damascus. Morgan's collections of papers including his translations of Welsh poetry are in the National Library of Wales.\n\nA book published at the time and attributed to his fellow M.P, Reginald Blewitt, describes Morgan as flippant in his youth and overbearing, arrogant, short and effeminate.\n\nToday his house's extensive dairy and orangery are gone as his home is now (2010) an educational facility for the Welsh National Health Service, but it is said that the house is still adorned with Latin inscriptions hidden within wooden carvings and a grand imported German fireplace bearing his initials.\n\n"}
{"id": "92888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=92888", "title": "Ostia Antica", "text": "Ostia Antica\n\nOstia Antica is a large archaeological site, close to the modern town of Ostia, that is the location of the harbour city of ancient Rome, 15 miles (25 kilometres) southwest of Rome. \"Ostia\" (plur. of \"ostium\") is a derivation of \"os\", the Latin word for \"mouth\". At the mouth of the River Tiber, Ostia was Rome's seaport, but due to silting the site now lies from the sea. The site is noted for the excellent preservation of its ancient buildings, magnificent frescoes and impressive mosaics.\n\nOstia may have been Rome's first \"colonia\". According to the legend Ancus Marcius, the semi-legendary fourth king of Rome, who was the first to destroy Ficana, an ancient town that was only from Rome and had a small harbour on the Tiber, and then proceeded with establishing the new colony further west and closer to the sea coast. An inscription seems to confirm the establishment of the old castrum of Ostia in the 7th century BC. The oldest archaeological remains so far discovered date back to only the 4th century BC. The most ancient buildings currently visible are from the 3rd century BC, notably the \"Castrum\" (military camp); of a slightly later date is the \"Capitolium\" (temple of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva). The \"opus quadratum\" of the walls of the original \"castrum\" at Ostia provide important evidence for the building techniques that were employed in Roman urbanisation during the period of the Middle Republic.\n\nOstia was a scene of fighting during the period of the civil wars between Gaius Marius and Sulla during the 1st century BC. In 87 BC, Marius attacked the city in order to cut off the flow of trade to Rome. Forces led by Lucius Cornelius Cinna, Gnaeus Papirius Carbo and Quintus Sertorius crossed the Tiber at three points before capturing the city and plundering it. After his victory here, Marius moved on to attack and capture Antium, Aricia and Lanuvium to further destroy the foodstores of Rome.\n\nIn 68 BC, the town was sacked by pirates. During the sack, the port was set on fire, the consular war fleet was destroyed, and two prominent senators were kidnapped. This attack caused such panic in Rome that Pompey the Great arranged for the tribune Aulus Gabinius to rise in the Roman Forum and propose a law, the \"lex Gabinia\", to allow Pompey to raise an army and destroy the pirates. Within a year, the pirates had been defeated.\n\nThe town was then re-built, and provided with protective walls by the statesman and orator Marcus Tullius Cicero.\n\nDuring Julius Caesar's time as Dictator, one of his improvements to the city was his establishment of better supervision of the supply of grain to Rome. He proposed better access to grain by the use of a new harbour in Ostia along with a canal from Tarracina.\nThe town was further developed during the first century AD under the influence of Tiberius, who ordered the building of the town's first Forum. The town was also soon enriched by the construction of a new harbour on the northern mouths of the Tiber (which reaches the sea with a larger mouth in Ostia, \"Fiumara Grande\", and a narrower one near to the current Fiumicino International Airport). The new harbor, not surprisingly called \"Portus\", from the Latin for \"harbour,\" was excavated from the ground at the orders of the emperor Claudius. This harbour became silted up and needed to be supplemented later by a harbour built by Trajan finished in the year 113 AD; it has a hexagonal form, in order to reduce the erosive forces of the waves. Moreover, it must be noted that at a relatively short distance, there was also the harbour of Civitavecchia (\"Centum Cellae\"). These elements took business away from Ostia itself and began its commercial decline. In 2008 British archaeologists discovered the remains of the widest canal ever built by the Romans, 90 feet, which they believe connected Portus with Ostia across the Isola Sacra, which would have made the transport of large quantities of goods far easier than by land transport. In 2014 remains on the north side of the river opposite the city were discovered and the built-up area of the city extended beyond the perimeter of the south wall (the area within it is 69 hectares or 173 acres).\n\nOstia itself was provided with all the services a town of the time could require; in particular, a famous lighthouse. The popularity of the Cult of Mithras is evident in the discovery of eighteen mithraea. Archaeologists have also discovered the public \"latrinae\", organised for collective use as a series of seats that allow us to imagine today that their function was also a social one. Ostia had a large theatre, many public baths (such as the Thermae Gavii Maximi, or Baths at Ostia), numerous taverns and inns and a firefighting service. Ostia also contained the Ostia Synagogue, the earliest synagogue yet identified in Europe; it created a stir when it was unearthed in 1960-61.\n\nOstia grew to 50,000 inhabitants in the 2nd century, reaching a peak of some 100,000 inhabitants in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.\nOstia became an episcopal see as early as the 3rd century AD, the cathedral (\"titulus\") of Santa Aurea being located on the burial site of St Monica, mother of Augustine; she died in an inn in the town in 387. \n\nIn time mercantile activities became focused on Portus instead. It used to be thought that the city entered a period of slow decline after Constantine I made Portus, Ostia ceasing to be an active port and instead becoming a popular country retreat for rich aristocrats from Rome itself.. In spite of the fact that Portus shows substantial growth in the 4th century the view that Ostia went into marked decline has had to be revised due to recent excavations and re-evaluation of the evidence. For scholars of the High Empire Ostia was the seaside version of Rome, the city of apartment buildings but became in late period \"Rome's seaside luxury resort.\" The knocking down of some apartment blocks replaced by houses of the rich \"were thought to have signalled the disappearance of Ostia's once-vibrant group of non-elite residents and labourers\"...\"recent research has suggested we take a more nuanced view of residential patterns and social demography in the Late Antique city\". Earlier views of decay relied on fleeting references in the ancient sources and excavators ignoring evidence from the period that the town continued to thrive despite pockets of decay into the 6th century, \"..life in Ostia ended not with a Vesuvian bang but with a whimper\" after a slow decline from the 6th to the 9th centuries: repairs on baths (26 remained in operation during the 4th century) and public buildings, church construction, street repaving, residential and business expansion beyond the perimeter of the south wall (the presence of a small harbour, the Porta Marina on the sea there) and a huge 4th century villa located east, and the continued operation of the river port on the western edge of the town, the navalia, a squarish basin built in from the river, a warehouse on the east side and behind it a large bath complex erroneously called the palazzo imperial).\n\nThe city was mentioned by St Augustine when he passed there in the late 4th century. The poet Rutilius Namatianus reported the lack of maintenance of the city ports in 414 AD.. This view has been challenged by Boin, who states Namatianus' verse is a literary construct and not consistent with the archaeological record, ibid. pp. 22, 25, (the poet was lamenting the lost greatness of Rome after the sack of 410 and was hoping for the rise again of the great city).\n\nWith the end of the Roman Empire, Ostia fell slowly into decay, and was finally abandoned in the 9th century due to the repeated invasions and sackings by Arab pirates, including the Battle of Ostia, a naval battle in 849 between Christians and Saracens; the remaining inhabitants moved to Gregoriopolis.\n\nA \"local sacking\" was carried out by Baroque architects, who used the remains as a sort of marble storehouse for the \"palazzi\" they were building in Rome. \n\nSoon after, foreign explorers came in search of ancient statues and objects.\n\nThe Papacy started organising its own investigations with Pope Pius VII; under Benito Mussolini massive excavations were undertaken from 1939 to 1942 during which several remains, particularly from the republican period, were brought to light. The first volume of the official series \"Scavi di Ostia\" appeared in 1954; it was devoted to a topography of the town by Italo Gismondi and after a hiatus the research still continues today. Though untouched areas adjacent to the original excavations were left undisturbed awaiting a more precise dating of Roman pottery types, the \"Baths of the Swimmer\", named for the mosaic figure in the \"apodyterium\", were meticulously excavated, in 1966–70 and 1974–75, in part as a training ground for young archaeologists and in part to establish a laboratory of well-understood finds as a teaching aid. It has been estimated that two-thirds of the ancient town are as yet unexcavated. In 2014, a geophysical survey using magnetometry, among other techniques, revealed the existence of a boundary wall on the north side of the Tiber enclosing an unexcavated area of the city containing three massive warehouses.\n\nThe excavated site of Ostia Antica is open to the public as a tourist attraction. A number of finds from the excavation are housed on-site in the Museo Ostiense. The site has dining, and other facilities. The Theatre is also occasionally used for cultural events.\n\n\n"}

It is made of stone and earth and was originally empty in the centre. In several cases the middle of the ring was later used (at Hound Tor, for example, there is a stone cist in the centre). The low profile of these cairns is not always possible to make out without conducting excavations.\n\nThese sites date to the Bronze Age and occur in Cornwall; Wales and Derbyshire (Barbrook IV and V and Green Low) in England and in Ireland.\n\nThe cairns look like flat variants of the significantly higher Clava cairns, which are often called ring cairns by laymen. The situation is rather different on the gritstones of the Eastern Uplands. Here it is more common to find smaller stone circles and ring cairns. The patterned relationship of these smaller monuments to cairnfield systems throughout the Eastern Moors suggests that they were built and used by specific communities, probably in the centuries around 2000 BC. Although details vary from one site to another, nearly all comprise a ring of small upright stones set on the inner edge of a roughly circular bank.\n\nRing cairns may have had a function that lay somewhere between that of the much older henges and the contemporary stone circles. The fact that in southeast Wales there are so few stone circles could be related to the fact that ring cairns were built there instead.\n\nAlthough graves have been found in some ring cairns, this does not appear to be their original purpose. In the central area, graves and pits with cremation ashes, fireplaces and sometimes, small, low cairns are found.\n\nThe slightly oval ring cairns near Arthur's Stone on the Gower Peninsula show that the inner edges of ring cairns were especially carefully constructed and were set in front of a small grave. Originally there was a passage through the ring here, about ten metres across, that was blocked when the cairn ceased to be used.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45141747", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45141747", "title": "Rose–Baley Party", "text": "Rose–Baley Party\n\nThe Rose–Baley Party was the first European American emigrant wagon train to traverse the 35th parallel route known as Beale's Wagon Road, established by Edward Fitzgerald Beale, from Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico to the Colorado River near present-day Needles, California.\n\nIn 1858, a wealthy businessman from Keosauqua, Iowa, Leonard John Rose, formed the party after hearing stories from gold miners returning from California. He subsequently financed a well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses and two hundred head of purebred red Durham cattle. He also acquired four large covered wagons and three yoke of oxen to pull them each wagon. The Rose company left Iowa in early April, and in mid-May they were joined by the Baley company, led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley. Their combined outfits numbered twenty wagons, forty men, fifty to sixty women and children, and nearly five hundred head of cattle. John Udell, a 62-year-old Baptist minister kept a daily journal of the party's travels, recording the locations of their campsites, documenting their progress, and noting the availability of resources.\n\nOn August 30, 1858, after having traveled more than in four months, the Rose–Baley Party were attacked by three hundred Mohave warriors as they prepared to cross the Colorado River. Eight members of the party were killed, including five children, and thirteen wounded. The emigrants held off the assault, killing seventeen Mohave, but decided to backtrack more than to Albuquerque, New Mexico, instead of continuing on to their intended destination in southern California.\n\nAccording to Charles W. Baley, great-grand nephew of Baley company leader, Gillum Baley, and the author of \"Disaster at the Colorado: Beale's Wagon Road and the First Emigrant Party\" (2002), little has been written about Beale's Wagon Road because the negative experiences of the first wagon trains to attempt the passage effectively \"discouraged its use\". Baley's great-grandparents joined his great-great uncle in forming the company in 1858, which merged with one led by Leonard John Rose to make the Rose–Baley Party.\n\nBaley's account drew heavily from the only known journal kept by a member of the group. John Udell, a 62-year-old Baptist minister who had left his home in Missouri with his wife, Emily, kept a daily record of the party's travels, recording the locations of their campsites and their estimated distance from Missouri, the weather and road conditions, and the availability of grass, water, and wood. Baley described Udell's journal as the \"basic framework\" of his research. The only other source of firsthand information is Rose, whose account was printed in the \"Missouri Republican\" in 1859, and later reprinted as an appendix in Dr. Robert Glass Cleland's work, \"The Cattle on a Thousand Hills: Southern California, 1850-1880\".\n\nIn October 1857, an expedition led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Los Angeles, California. The wagon road began at Fort Smith and continued through Fort Defiance, Arizona before crossing the Colorado River near present-day Needles, California. The location where Beale crossed the river, en route to California, became known as Beale's Crossing. Beale described the route, \"It is the shortest from our western frontier by , being nearly directly west. It is the most level: our wagons only double-teaming once in the entire distance, and that at a short hill, and over a surface heretofore unbroken by wheels or trail on any kind. It is well-watered: our greatest distance without water at any time being . It is well-timbered, and in many places the growth is far beyond that of any part of the world I have ever seen. It is temperate in climate, passing for the most part over an elevated region. It is salubrious: not one of our party requiring the slightest medical attendance from the time of our leaving to our arrival ... It crosses the great desert (which must be crossed by any road to California) at its narrowest point.\"\n\nDuring the summer of 1858, a large emigrant wagon train became the first to traverse Beale's 35th parallel route to Mohave country. A wealthy businessman from Keosauqua, Iowa, Leonard John Rose, known as L.J. Rose, formed a company with his family of seven, his foreman, Alpha Brown, and his family, and seventeen grubstakers, workers who were not paid a salary, but given food and board in exchange for their labor. Rose was born in Rottenburg, Germany in 1827; at the age of eight, he immigrated to the United States. In 1892, writing in \"The Californian\", he identified what motivated him to leave Iowa, where he had built several successful businesses:\n\nTo finance the venture, Rose sold the majority of his assets, and after paying off his debts was left with $30,000, then a considerable amount of money. These funds enabled him to finance an especially well-equipped wagon train that included twenty horses, including two Morgan fillies and a Morgan stallion named Black Morrill; their combined value exceeded $3,000. He also purchased two hundred head of red Durham cattle, which he planned to resell in California for profit. To complete the train, Rose acquired four large ox-drawn prairie schooner style covered wagons, each required three yokes (i.e. six oxen) to pull each wagon. Three wagons were loaded with supplies, and the fourth was used by Alpha Brown and his family. Rose's family traveled in a small wagon that had once been used as an ambulance, which was pulled by a pair of mules. \n\nAccording to Baley, political and economic factors prompted two Hedgpeth and two Baley families to leave northwestern Missouri for California in early 1858. One factor was the enactment of the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which admitted Nebraska into the Union as a free territory and granted Kansas the right to decide on the legality of slavery within the state. The resulting tensions between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups fueled conflict near the Missouri state line, affecting its western counties, including Nodaway, where the Baleys and Hedgpeths lived. In Baley's opinion, the financial Panic of 1857 further contributed to instability in the region, driving many mid-westerners to seek a better life in California. The combined Baley-Hedgpeth outfits were led by a forty-four-year-old veteran of the Black Hawk War, Gillum Baley, and comprised eight Murphy wagons, sixty-two oxen, seventy-five head of cattle, and several riding horses. They employed half-a-dozen grubstakers to tend their stock.\n\nThe Rose company left Iowa in April; they traveled to Kansas City, Missouri, then named Westport, which they reached via steamboat across the Missouri River. In mid-May, they were joined by the Baley company while resting at Cottonwood Creek, near present-day Durham, Kansas. In the interests of safety, the groups agreed to an informal merger; their combined outfits numbered twenty wagons, forty men, fifty to sixty women and children, and nearly five hundred head of unbranded cattle.\n\nBaley notes that whereas most emigrants who traveled from the Midwestern United States to the West Coast took the Oregon Trail, in 1858 concerns about the Mormon War led many, including the Rose–Baley Party, to avoid Utah by taking the Santa Fe Trail to New Mexico, where a viable southern route could then be taken to California. The Santa Fe Trail followed the Arkansas River until it split into two paths near Cimarron, Kansas. The Mountain Branch continued into the mountains of southern Colorado, and the Cimarron Cutoff avoided mountains, but traversed the fifty-mile-wide Cimarron Desert before the paths met near Las Vegas, New Mexico. The Cimarron Cutoff was shorter and easier to navigate with large wagons, but according to Baley it also led its travelers through the territory of the hostile Comanche and Kiowa people. Nonetheless, the Rose–Baley Party chose this path.\n\nThe wagon train reached Albuquerque, New Mexico on June 23 and prepared for the journey to the Colorado River by way of Zuni Pueblo, New Mexico, where, despite Udell's lone dissent, they would become the first emigrant train to venture onto Beale's Wagon Road. Udell, writing in his journal, explained his concern: \"I thought it was preposterous to start on so long a journey with so many woman and helpless children, and so many dangers attending the attempt.\" According to Baley, the emigrants first learned of the recently surveyed road while visiting Albuquerque. Townspeople and army officers, including Benjamin Bonneville, encouraged them to take the new route, which was shorter than the established southern trails by , or approximately thirty days travel. They were also told that there was a reliable supply of food and water along the way, and the area was free of hostile Native Americans. E.F. Beale was in Washington, D.C. at the time, making recommendations to members of Congress and the War Department:\n\nBeale suggested that, in addition to a military fort, the route was also in immediate need of bridges and dams to ensure safe travel and provide a reliable water supply; he requested $100,000 to fund the improvements. Further complicating the journey, the only pockets of civilization between Albuquerque and San Bernardino, California, a distance of , were the Zuni and Laguna pueblos. According to Baley, US Army officers stationed in Albuquerque insisted the emigrants hire Jose Manuel Savedra, a Mexican guide who had traveled with Beale during his initial survey of the route, and his interpreter, Petro. Unbeknownst to the group, Beale was unhappy with Savedra's scouting abilities, and had demoted him to helping with the animals in the pack train. The Rose–Baley Party paid Savedra's fee of $500 in advance.\n\nUdell recorded that the Rose–Baley Party left Albuquerque on June 26 and began crossing the Rio Grande on a ferry. Three days later, as the last of their outfit crossed, one of Rose's men, Frank Emerdick, drowned in the river. Baley notes that they traveled for the next five days and, because there were no suitable campsites nearby, did not stop to celebrate Independence Day, as would most westbound emigrants. On July 5, they reached the Zuni Mountains, a branch of the Rocky Mountains; two days later they traversed the Continental Divide of the Americas, which, although to feet in elevation, was a relatively easy passage. Udell described the road as \"smooth and fine, we traveled it in a day with our ox teams, and no hard labor.\" On July 7, they camped near El Morro National Monument, then called Inscription Rock, and several members of the party, including Rose and Udell, carved their names into stone – a tradition dating back to 1605. Their inscriptions indicated that they were aware of being the first emigrants in the region.\n\nOn July 10, the Rose–Baley Party reached Zuni Pueblo, which according to Baley was then home to as many as two thousand agricultural Native Americans. They spent several hours visiting and sightseeing, and the Zuni sold them cornmeal and vegetables, as this was the last such opportunity to purchase supplies until San Bernardino, approximately away. According to Baley, this is most likely the first time the Zuni had encountered European women and children, and the first time the emigrants had ever seen people with albinism, which, although rare, was noticeably present in the Zuni population. They left Zuni Pueblo late that afternoon and entered unfamiliar territory that, until now, had only been traversed by Native Americans, explorers, mountain men, and Spanish missionaries. In Baley's opinion, the Rose–Baley Party had previously enjoyed the benefits of a primitive but well-established trail; however, at this point they became the first emigrant wagon train to venture onto the untested Beale's Wagon Road.\n\nIn Baley's opinion, Udell was right to be concerned about the road, and adds: \"although Beale had taken a few wagons over the route, [in 1858 it] was little more than a survey trail marked only by faint wagon tracks, an occasional stone cairn, and perhaps a few axe blazes on trees.\" Portions of the road followed human and animal trails, and – although potable water was sporadically available – there were also long stretches called \"jornadas\", where it was scarce. From the San Francisco Peaks to the Colorado River, vital resources were in short supply.\n\nBecause Beale's Wagon Road crossed territory that consisted mainly of the Colorado Plateau's rocky high desert, the next water available to the Rose–Baley Party was at a spot named Jacob's Well, located west of Zuni Pueblo and west of their July 10 campsite. Accordingly, Baley notes that the emigrants were careful to not get lost between watering holes. Udell recorded that, after traveling for more than half a day, they rested and watered their stock at the well, which produced brackish but acceptable water. Later that evening, they trekked another to Navajo Springs, where they camped for the night and rested the next day.\n\nAccording to Udell's journal, after Navajo Springs the next available water was distant, at the Little Colorado River. In between was an area that is now home to Petrified Forest National Park, and several members of the party gathered souvenirs of petrified wood there. They reached the Little Colorado at a spot near present-day Holbrook, Arizona, on July 16, and although the river was brackish and underscored with quicksand, the emigrants were able to secure drinkable water by digging holes in the riverbank that allowed sediment to settle until the water was clear enough for consumption. Next, they followed the river to a location that Baley identified as Canyon Diablo.\n\nOn July 18, Udell recorded that spirits were high amongst the Rose–Baley Party: \"Our large company continue to be harmonious, friendly, and kind to each other ... General good health prevails ... Travel today, , and 1,112 from the Missouri River.\" The Rose–Baley Party diverged from the Little Colorado River where it meets Canyon Diablo, near present-day Winslow, Arizona. Uncertain where the next source of clean water was, they decided to camp near the canyon, where they successfully hunted for game while searching for a fresh spring. By the late afternoon of July 24, Savedra returned to camp and reported that they had found water away at Walnut Creek, now part of Walnut Canyon National Monument. They immediately packed up their camp and left, as they were becoming accustomed to evening and night travel, which allowed them to refrain from exertion during the peak heat of the day. They covered on July 25 before stopping near a spring in the pine-covered foothills of Arizona's tallest mountains, the San Francisco Peaks, which can be seen for in most directions. The range's cool forests gave them a much-needed respite from the intense heat and aridity of the high plains desert.\n\nBaley notes that the Rose–Baley Party so enjoyed their camp, near present-day Flagstaff, Arizona, they decided to devote a few extra days to recuperation and sightseeing, and several members of the wagon train climbed Humphreys Peak, which at 12,633 feet is the highest point in Arizona. While climbing the mountain, they came across a large snowfield and were surprised to see snow and ice in late July. Before their descent, they entertained themselves by pushing a massive boulder down the mountainside. Up to this point, the emigrants had enjoyed a primitive but decent road, good small game hunting, and a consistent supply of water, grass, and wood. They had experienced what Baley described as \"beautiful and interesting\" scenery and encountered only friendly Native Americans; however, a drastic change in these conditions was imminent.\n\nAccording to Baley, on July 29 Savedra informed the Rose–Baley Party, now camped near Leroux Springs, that the next reliable drinking water was seventy or away, and there would not be a closer source until the coming rainy season. This distance exceeded what most animals could travel without water, and several members of the party were opposed to proceeding any further west until another source had been found. Udell disagreed, \"I contended that we had better travel on, for, with careful and proper treatment, we could get the stock through to water, and if we remain here until the rainy season, in all human probability our provisions would be exhausted, and we should parish with starvation.\" Despite his pleas, nobody wanted to go on until they had located potable water, so six men agreed to undertake a search in hopes that Savedra had overlooked a closer source. Two days later, a man returned to camp and reported that a spring had been found west, but its supply was so sparse that it could not meet the needs of the entire wagon train at once. After a thorough debate it was decided that, despite stern warnings from Army officers in Albuquerque against splitting into smaller groups, the best course of action was to divide the train in two and water their stock separately.\n\nUdell recorded that on August 1, the Rose company ventured west without the Baley company, who waited one full day before starting out from Leroux Springs. In the meantime, the search party had located enough springs to sustain them for the next . Several days later, the party reached their last known source of water, and Savedra informed them that there was not another for . Because that was too long for their animals to travel without water, the party decided to backtrack approximately to the location of the last reliable supply at Cataract Creek. Udell again protested to no avail, recording in his journal that night: \"Had there been a road that I could have traveled without a guide, I should have gone on and risked the consequences.\" Having trekked without clean water, the party's stock had grown extremely thirsty. The supply at Cataract Canyon was limited, and it contained what Udell called \"wigglers\"; however, they had no choice but to drink from, and allow their animals to drink from, the less than ideal source. By August 9, the Rose–Baley Party had begun to lose confidence in Savedra's ability to find water, and had been forced to do their own scouting for the precious resource. They had taken to building casks out of pine in hopes that they could gather enough in containers to last them until the next acceptable supply. Udell wrote, \"Our water still holds out ... like the widow's cruse of oil, and tastes more pleasant, having been stirred up so often for us.\"\n\nOn August 13, Udell noted that the area received a substantial rainfall that marginally eased the Rose–Baley Party's concerns regarding the scarcity of water in the region. Later that evening, the men who had been searching for it during the last five days returned to camp and reported that they had found an acceptable source distant and another away. The emigrants spent the next morning filling casks and preparing for travel; they left late that afternoon, and after having trekked continuously for nearly twenty-four hours arrived at Partridge Creek the next day. That night a thunderstorm filled the creek with rainwater, further easing their concerns; however, after traveling the following day, they realized that the recent rainfalls has not reached that far, forcing them to make a dry camp on August 17.\n\nOn August 18, after having traveled the last without reliable grass or water, the Rose–Baley Party located a field and a spring that were sufficient to satisfy their stock. That night, despite posting round-the-clock guards, a mare and a mule went missing, and three searchers were sent to find them. They tracked the animals to a deep canyon, where Native Americans hiding in the rocks shot arrows at them. Savedra noticed the Natives watching the party from the nearby foothills the following day, and was able to draw them into camp using sign language. In Baley's opinion, the Natives were most likely Hualapai. They could speak a few words of Spanish and English, and Savedra was able to communicate with them using their dialect and sign language. They admitted to having the group's missing animals, but insisted that the Mohave had stolen them. They repeatedly thumped their chest while uttering, \"Hanna, Hanna\", meaning \"good\" Native, insisting that the Mohave were \"bad\" Natives.\n\nAccording to Rose, Savedra knew that the Mohave rarely ventured this far from their homelands, so they assumed the Hualapai had taken the animals, which were returned the following morning as the party camped at Peach Springs. The animals were led back by twenty-five Natives hoping for compensation in return, as Udell explained: \"It was soon evident that they expected very extravagant rewards, all expecting shoes, clothing, and trinkets, besides some cattle ... many remained in camp with us that night, doubtless for the purpose of stealing, but the guard kept so sharp a lookout that they found no opportunity.\" On August 20, the party awoke to another fifty Hualapai anticipating gifts in exchange for the return of the stolen animals. The Natives left around noon, after receiving tobacco, trinkets, and food, but the emigrants noticed that six oxen were missing. A search team located four carcasses that had been stripped of their flesh; the other two animals were found nearby, having been recently killed, but not yet butchered. That night, the Rose–Baley Party decided to once again split their wagon train in response to the scarcity of water. According to Baley, as they journeyed from their campsite at Peach Springs to the Colorado River more than away, they were almost continuously harassed by Natives, who sent arrows flying into their wagon train during the day and raided their camp at night.\n\nUdell recorded that in the late afternoon of August 27, 1858, the Rose–Baley Party reached the Black Mountains. They made their crossing at Sitgreaves Pass, elevation 3,652 feet and named after Lieutenant Lorenzo Sitgreaves, who led an expedition party to the region in 1851. From the crest they could see the Colorado River in the distance. Having traveled all night and worked continuously during the morning and afternoon, the Rose–Baley Party stopped to prepare their first meal of the day. Soon afterward, a small group of Mohave warriors approached and asked, in a combination of broken English and Spanish, how many people their wagon train included and whether they intended to permanently settle near the Colorado River. The Mohave, who appeared friendly and had brought with them corn and melons, which they sold to the emigrants, were promised that the wagon train planned to travel through the region en route to their intended destination in Southern California. This seemed to appease the Natives, many of whom helped the party during their descent down the western slope of the Black Mountains to the Colorado River below. The emigrants were now entering Mohave country, near present-day Needles, California.\n\nBy midnight, the Baley company had fallen behind the Rose company and decided to stop and make a mountain camp while Rose and others continued to the Colorado River, where they planned to water their combined stock and build a raft in preparation for the impending river crossing. By noon on August 28, Rose had reached a patch of Cottonwood trees about one mile from the river, where their oxen were unhitched and allowed to join the loose stock racing towards the water. There the emigrants encountered more Mohave, but unlike the friendly ones that greeted them at Sitgreaves Pass, these were rude and hostile. After a thorough watering, the work oxen were returned to the wagons. Rose and his wife, Amanda, decided to scout the river bank for a suitable campsite, exiting their wagon to make the journey by foot. Moments later, an aggressive Mohave placed his hand on her shoulder and bosom, and she ran back, terrified, to the relative safety of their wagon. Rose, not wanting to incite the Mohave, ignored the incident and continued to the river. Other Mohave harassed Alpha Brown's family, briefly threatening to take his wife's dress and abduct their son. That danger was averted, but many Mohave set about driving off and slaughtering several of the party's cattle before leaving the emigrants alone at their encampment, some two hundred yards from the river and away from the Baley company's mountain camp.\n\nThe following morning, they moved their camp to the river bank to facilitate easier watering of their stock. They were visited around noon by twenty-five warriors and a Mohave sub-chief, who heard their complaints about the killing of their livestock and assured them that no further depredations would occur, and that they could cross the Colorado as they pleased. About one hour later, another chief and several warriors approached the camp; after receiving gifts, they also left without incident. According to Rose, upon hearing of the emigrants plans the chief gave them, \"a very searching look, as if not half believing it\". By noon, the party had moved their camp still closer to where they planned to cross, about a mile downriver near a patch of cottonwood trees that were suitable for building rafts.\n\nAccording to Baley, at approximately 2 p.m. on August 30, 1858, the emigrants camped near the Colorado River heard Alpha Brown's step-daughter, Sallie Fox, screaming. She had been playing in a wagon when she noticed several Mohave nearby. Having lost the element of surprise, three hundred warriors then let out war whoops as they shot arrows into the camp, mortally wounding Rose's foreman, Alpha Brown. Udell described the attack as \"like a shower\" of arrows. According to Rose, \"I have no doubt they expected to massacre us. But we were well armed and the men that were in camp ready to receive them.\" As the men mounted a defense, the women ran with their children to the covered wagons. Both Udell and Rose stated that the fighting lasted for approximately two hours. Baley explains that when a Mohave chief who appeared to be leading the attack stepped out in front of his warriors and taunted the emigrants, Gillum Baley, a veteran of the Black Hawk War and a noted marksman, took him down with a single rifle shot. The Mohave warriors then retrieved the chief's body and retreated from the battle.\n\nAccording to Udell, eight members of the Rose-Baley party had been killed and thirteen wounded. Rose stated that of the train's livestock, only ten horses and seventeen cattle remained. Baley notes that in addition to the killing of Alpha Brown, the entirety of the seven-member Bentner family, including five children, were massacred while traveling unaccompanied from Baley's mountain camp to Rose's river camp. However subsequent investigations showed that the Bentner's were attacked by a group of Hualapais including 7 renegade Mohave warriors. The emigrants killed approximately seventeen Mohave warriors. In the opinion of the cultural anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber, \"the event sealed the fate of the Mohave as an independent people.\" In 1859, the US military established Fort Mohave near the location of the battle at Beale's Crossing.\n\nWhen the battle had ended, and the Mohave retreated, the Rose company gathered to discuss their options. Being low on ammunition and manpower, the emigrants were not confident in their ability to hold off another attack. So, although San Bernardino, at about away was much closer, they unanimously decided to backtrack the nearly to Albuquerque. Because they were dangerously low on supplies, their successful return to Albuquerque was partly contingent upon finding assistance from west-bound emigrants. Before beginning the return trip, they wrapped Alpha Brown's body in chains and committed it to the Colorado River. With only one remaining wagon and the ambulance, they decided which items they could carry and which they should abandon. Those who were able rode horses, and the rest walked.\n\nAt approximately 6 p.m., with the wounded in one wagon, the children in the ambulance, and the healthy adults on foot, the Rose company began the difficult journey back to Albuquerque, during which, according to the author Arthur Woodward, they observed a fiery comet that further upset the already frightened children. By 10 p.m. the party began to hear war whoops and the clanging of pots and pans coming from the direction of the Colorado River. Baley suggests that the Mohave had returned to \"finish them off\", but after finding a large cache of supplies celebrated their windfall, which included Rose's eight-dollar-a-bottle brandy. In Baley's opinion, the newfound spoils were likely the only reason the Mohave didn't follow the fleeing wagon train, now en route to rendezvous with the Baley company at their mountain camp.\n\n"}

The center panel's far right contains the exterior of the same building shown in the next scene from the inside, juxtaposing the stable with the temple and thereby causing an innovative yet jarring spatial and temporal juxtaposition. The stable is in Bethlehem, the Temple in Jerusalem, yet here they co-exist and function to bridge a gap from the Old to the New Testament.

It is reasonable to assume such a prominent resident of the city commissioned the piece. According to Lorne Campbell, based on the number of known copies, the piece probably never left the private chapel until 1801.

There is no record of the death of a Sam Hide in the records of Dedham, Massachusetts though he is said to have died in 1732, however Sam Hide is noted at age 105 at Dedham as being a \"sachem, chief or sagamore who first and last were, to a greater or less degree, land-holders, and leaders of the multifarious tribes of New England\". \n\nHide was said to be a Native American, a great wit, and an infamous cider-drinker and liar. It has been speculated by James Wimer that Sam Hide may be a composite of several early anecdotes and stories. \n\nNumerous folk tales are told about Sam Hide; one such tale is that of Hide and a deer which illustrates his telling of lies or tall tales. In the story, Hide was in search of a glass of (hard) cider, so went to the house of a neighbor and offered, for a crown coin, to tell the man where he had shot and killed a deer. The man, wanting to find the deer meat, counter-offered half a crown, so Hide described a local meadow, then described a tree in that meadow, saying that the deer was to be found under that tree. The man went off to find the deer, but found none and returned home empty handed. Years later, he ran across Hide and accused him of trickery. Hide asked if the man would find it acceptable if an Indian told the truth half the time, and the man said he would. Hide then noted that he had told the truth about there being a meadow, and about there being a tree, just not about there being a deer beneath the tree, and concluded that he had told two truths to one lie, thus ending the matter.\n\nGeorge Lyman Kittredge recounts tales of Hide having faithfully served the English in wars against Indian tribes and earning himself the name of a brave soldier. In one story, Hide is said to have killed 19, of the enemy, and tried hard to make up the 20th, but was unable:\n\nThe claim of the 19 enemy may have been from “Hubbard’s Indian Wars”, 1677 edition.\n"}

The Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, which existed in the present-day southeastern European nations of Moldova, Romania, and Ukraine during the Neolithic Age and Copper Age, from approximately 5500 to 2750 BC, left behind thousands of settlement ruins containing a wealth of archaeological artifacts attesting to their cultural and technological characteristics. Refer to the main article for a general description of this culture; this article deals with its settlements.\n\nThe latest research (2014) suggest that some of the largest mega sites contained as many as 3,000 structures and with the possibility of 20,000 to 46,000 inhabitants. Maidanets may have contained almost 3,000 houses and a population of anything between 12,000 and 46,000 with 29,000 as the average population figure. Dobrovody and Talianki are estimated with populations up to 16,200 and 21,000.\n\nIn terms of overall size, some of Cucuteni-Trypillia sites, such as Talianki (with a population of 15,000 and covering an area of some 450 hectares – 1100 acres) in the Uman district of Ukraine, are as large as (or perhaps even larger than) the more famous city-states of Sumer in the Fertile Crescent, and these Eastern European settlements predate the Sumerian cities by more than half of a millennium. The reason that academicians have not designated the gigantic settlements of Cucuteni-Trypillia culture as \"cities\", is due to the lack of conclusive evidence for internal social differentiation or specialization. However, there is some debate among scholars whether these settlements ought to be labeled as proto-cities.\n\nThe Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements were usually located on a place where the geomorphology provided natural barriers to protect the site: most notably using high river terraces or canyon edges. The natural barriers were supplemented with fences, earthworks and ditches, or even more elaborate wooden and clay ramparts. The role of the fortifications found at these settlements was probably to protect the tribe's domestic animal herd from wild predators. Other hypotheses are that the fortifications were for protection against enemy attacks, or as a means to gather the community. The role of these fortifications, however, is still debated among scholars.\n\nThe most common arrangement of construction for Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements was to place most of the buildings in a circular pattern surrounding a central structure; some examples of this arrangements were found at Târpeşti, Ioblona, Berezivka, Onoprievka, and Răşcani. The earliest villages consisted of ten to fifteen wattle-and-daub households. In their heyday, settlements expanded to include several hundred large huts, sometimes with two stories. These houses were typically warmed by an oven, and had round windows. Some of the huts included kilns, which were used to fire the distinctive pottery for which the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture is known for.\n\nThese settlements underwent periodical acts of destruction and re-creation, as they were burned and then rebuilt every 60–80 years. Some scholars have theorized that the inhabitants of these settlements believed that every house symbolized an organic, almost living, entity. Each house, including its ceramic vases, ovens, figurines and innumerable objects made of perishable materials, shared the same circle of life, and all of the buildings in the settlement were physically linked together as a larger symbolic entity. As with living beings, the settlements may have been seen as also having a life cycle of death and rebirth.\n\nAs the settlements grew larger, the houses were arranged in two elliptical rows, separated by a space of 70–100 metres (220–320 feet). Each household was almost completely self-supportive within these communities, as if instead of being located within a settlement, each family was living away from town and neighbors in the country. There was a lack of public infrastructure within these settlements, which compelled the inhabitants to include all aspects of their lives within their own domicile; ovens, kilns, working, and sleeping areas were all contained within the same space as the family’s sacred altars. Thus the buildings included both the sacred and profane, which some authorities see as evidence to support the idea that the inhabitants viewed their homes as living beings.\n\n \nThe existence of the giant settlements was discovered in the 1960s, when the military topographer K.V. Shishkin noticed the presence of peculiar spots from certain aerial photographs.\n\nScholars posit two theories regarding the impetus behind the formation of the large Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements:\n\nUkrainian archeologist Ivan T. Černjakov credits the large size of some of the Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements to their agricultural system, which was affected by the climatic changes over the years. This can be seen by examining the historic and modern changes in sea level of the nearby Black Sea.\n\nSome of these large settlements include:\nAt 2009 British-Ukrainian archaeological expedition, organized by John Chapman and Mykhailo Videiko focussed on the 300-ha. mega-site of Nebelivka, Kirovograd domain, enabling the production of a 15-ha. geophysics plot with over 50 burnt structures and a small number of unburnt structures, as well as pits and other anomalies. Remains of one house was excavated. This settlement, dated to BII perion of Trypillia Culture, was the largest around 4000 BC.\n\nWith the mega settlements of the Cucuteni–Trypillia culture starting in 4300 BC the period of very large settlements would continue for almost 2000 years. To date (2014) more than 2440 Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements are discovered so far in Moldova, Ukraine and Romania. 194 (8%) of these settlements had an area of more than 10 hectares between 5000 - 2700 B.C. and more than 29 settlements had an area in the range 100 - 300 - 450 Hectares and 2800 houses.\n\nThe settlements were primarily administrative, military and religious centres and not for crafts. The typical Trypillia hierarchy was one dominant \"capital\" with a population up to 15000 people and more than 100 Hectares, this capital was surrounded by satellite towns typically in the size range 10-40 Hectares and villages in the range of 2-7 Hectares. The Capital controlled territories as far away as 20 km (12,5 mi) from the center.\nThe latest research indicates that the settlements had three level settlement hierarchy, with the possibility of state-level societies. An excavated mega-structures suggests the presence of public buildings for meetings or ceremonies.\n\nThe following are a list with the largest settlements with approximate time of peak population. Remember, population estimates of ancient settlements should always be taken with caution, with different interpretations depending on the scholar.\n\nUltimately, the large scale of the Cucuteni-Trypillia settlements may have contributed to the downfall of their society, according to a theory that attributes their collapse to ecological factors. Due to a dramatic worldwide climate change around 3200 BC, the area of the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture would have been plunged into a devastating \"Dust Bowl\" type of drought. With their reliance on agriculture to produce food, feeding the many inhabitants of these large-scale settlements would have been unsustainable, leading to the dramatic end of the Cucuteni-Trypillia farming society, and replaced by the more drought-appropriate pastoral nomadic society of the Proto-Indo-Europeans that followed. \n\n"}

They were made in attempt to market the popular concept of troll dolls to young boys in the early 1990s.\n\nIntroduced in 1992 at $4.99 to $6.99, the trolls were marketed with the slogan “Big Haired Dudes with Bad Attitudes” and were actually quite large at approximately 4 3/4 inches tall (not including roughly 4 inches of hair). The line did not establish a story arc to provide a unifying narrative for the characters as a group. However each individual troll was provided a brief biographical profile (in parody of a ), and, details on their cardbacks as how to properly \"neglect\" them suggested that the owner hide them in \"a dark, smelly place\" and keep them \"cranky, mean and ready to fight anything or anyone for years!\". In association with their tough nature, many of them had facial stitches and their toes poking through their boots.\n\nThe line featured 26 individual characters, two of which were repaints available in special \"vehicle sets\".

Though much of the line consisted of references to classic fiction and popular culture, it was retired in 1993 after a third, much scarcer run with 8 final characters. A fourth series was planned, but never produced. The prototypes were displayed at the 1993 New York Toy Fair. This featured a line of six villains called the \"Evil Horde\", including trolls styled after the Joker, Swamp Thing, an Alien, and one that looked like a hooded executioner. A promotional photo of the group can be viewed online.\n\nImitations of Battle Trolls were made by competing companies: \"Troll Warriors\" by \"Tyco\", \"Troll Fighter\" by \"Simba\", and \"Troll Force\" by \"Toys 'n Things\".\n\n\"Battle Trolls\" were introduced in three assortments.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "529574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=529574", "title": "Triumph the Insult Comic Dog", "text": "Triumph the Insult Comic Dog\n\nTriumph the Insult Comic Dog is a puppet character puppeteered and voiced by Robert Smigel, best known for mocking celebrities in an Eastern European accent. As his name indicates, Triumph's comedic style is almost exclusively insult comedy. A Montenegrin Mountain Hound, Triumph often puffs a cigar, which usually falls out of his mouth when he starts talking. He debuted in 1997 on NBC's \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and also appeared on \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" from time to time, as well as the short-lived \"TV Funhouse\", TBS's \"Conan\", and Adult Swim's \"The Jack and Triumph Show\". Smigel and Triumph have been ejected from several events for Triumph's antics, including Westminster (three times), the Honolulu line for auditions for \"American Idol\", and the 2004 Democratic National Convention (while shooting an aborted movie project).\n\nTriumph's debut was in a comedy skit about unusually talented dogs at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show (WKC). In addition to other dog puppets who played banjos and performed magic, Triumph appeared in his trademark persona of an obnoxious and ribald insult comic in the vein of Don Rickles. The character rapidly grew in popularity, and became a recurring fixture on the show, often mocking the show's celebrity guests and leaving the studio to sexually harass members of the general public in pre-taped remote segments. On subsequent visits to the WKC, he would often be found \"humping\" (attempting to mate with), and occasionally being \"humped\" by other dogs.\n\nIn one widely downloaded segment, Triumph interviewed \"Star Wars\" fans waiting in line for the theatrical premiere of \"\". In that segment, Triumph met Blackwolf the Dragonmaster (who calls himself \"New York's unofficial wizard\"). Originally visiting the lineup to \"pay his respect\" to the \"Star Wars\" fans, Blackwolf was spotted by Triumph and cited as being \"a geek from another dimension\". Approaching Blackwolf, Triumph quickly associated him as being part of \"The Lord of the Rings\" fan base (based on Blackwolf's fantasy costume) and then asked, \"Have you ever talked to a woman without having to give your credit card number?\" Triumph then pitted a \"Star Wars\" fan (in full Jedi costume) in a mock duel against Blackwolf and stated that the winner would be declared the \"über-dork\". Another moment involved a pregnant \"Star Wars\" fan who was also waiting in line. When told of the baby's expected due date, Triumph responded, \"that's the last time he [the baby] will see female genitalia.\" Later, while talking to a fan dressed in full Darth Vader regalia, Triumph directs his attention to the buttons on his chest and remarked, \"Which one of these calls your parents to pick you up?\" Eventually irritated by the \"Star Wars\" cosplay activity, Triumph concludes his day at the \"Star Wars\" lineup by summoning Angry Spock (another \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" character). Dressed as the Vulcan character Spock (from the \"Star Trek\" franchise) and possessing a quiet demeanor, Angry Spock promptly and silently proceeds down the lineup and nonchalantly gives everyone the finger. The segment was shown as part of a series of \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" best-ofs during the final two weeks of that show's run.\n\nTriumph insulted the entire state of New Jersey when he traveled to the Meadowlands to interview Bon Jovi on their return to their home state (according to Triumph: \"much like poop, returning up into the butthole\"). He proceeded to tear down everything the band has done, knocking their age, lack of media (\"People have come from as far away as exit 12!\"), Jon Bon Jovi's foray into acting (\"You're doing a , yes? That's good. Finally a role that \"requires\" you to suck!\") and even humped Heather Locklear's arm. (She was married to Bon Jovi lead guitarist Richie Sambora at the time). Triumph displayed a mock playlist on the stage consisting of song titles like \"Crap\", \"Poop\", \"Loads of Crap (ballad version)\" and others saying \"They haven't closed with \"Turd\" since 1989! Awesome!\" He visited the \"real heterosexuals\" (the road crew) and produced his own bong made from a doggy squeaky toy and an Alpo can. He, naturally, insulted every drunk fan he could find, knocking the 1980s dress and hair along with the blue collar and unemployment jokes. For his finale, he got to sing \"You Give Love a Bad Name\" with the band and his own words: \"Humped a shar pei/ pulled out too late/ now that bitch has a litter of eight/ they eat all the Alpo, right off my plate/ why the hell didn't I just masturbate?! Oh, I'm a loaded gun!/ Here comes Bon Jovi, the pooping's begun!/ Look at you guys, have you no shame?/ You give poop a bad name! Crawl back in the butt from whence you came!/ You give poop a bad name!\"\n\nTriumph filmed a number of segments during the 2004 US presidential election cycle. In November 2003, in the early days of the 2004 U.S. presidential primary campaign, Triumph was the \"lead guest\" on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" the same night that Democratic candidate John Kerry also appeared on the show. Kerry made a dramatic entry, riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle onto the stage; but Triumph, in characteristic style, poked fun at him with a series of scathingly rude remarks, to Kerry's evident discomfort. (Among his jibes: \"The poop I made in the dressing room had more heat than John Kerry!\")\n\nAfter the third presidential debate, Triumph went on a tour of Spin Alley, the traditional post-debate press briefing in which high-profile members of both parties \"in the tradition of Joseph Goebbels, Baghdad Bob, and Carson Daly, ladle out poop stew\", according to Triumph. During this segment Triumph insulted many notable political strategists, including Karl Rove (\"You're Bush's brains, Karl. I was expecting a much smaller man\"), Paul Begala (\"This guy's head was so far up Clinton's butt, they called him The Colonoscope\"), and Joe Lockhart (\"Can you spin a woman into thinking you don't look gross in the shower?\") In an exchange with conservative commentator Ralph Reed, Triumph tried to ask a question about gay marriage, only to be rebuffed as Reed said, \"I don't take questions from dogs.\" Triumph responded: \"Oh, you'll take it, bitch!\"\n\nIn July and August 2004, Triumph followed up with visits to both major parties' national conventions. During the Democratic National Convention in Boston (from which he was ejected), Triumph and Michael Moore attempted to crash Bill O'Reilly's set. O'Reilly, having his makeup applied at the time, shouted, \"If I have to come out there, Insult Dog, you're gonna be talking a lot higher than you are now.\" He also gained entry to the Republican convention in New York, and even debated actor Ron Silver during the wrap-up on MSNBC.\n\nIn addition to regular appearances on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", Triumph has appeared on the MTV Video Music Awards, including an exchange with Jennifer Lopez in which he asks Lopez for permission to sniff her butt because \"for a dog, it's like climbing Mount Everest.\" MTV later removed the segment from rebroadcast airings. She recalled how her first reaction to the dog was \"Get the f*** out of my face!\" The following year, Triumph interviewed Moby and then approached an angry Eminem, prompting MTV to cut away from the segment. Eminem later referred to and impersonated Triumph on the track \"Ass Like That\" from his 2004 album \"Encore\", and subsequently appeared in the video, with himself playing Triumph.\n\nIn February 2004, there was a skit where Triumph hurled insults at French Canadians in Quebec during \"Late Night\"s special week of shows taped in Toronto, Ontario. He poked fun at Quebec nationalism, at one point telling a portly French-Canadian that before separating from Canada he should \"try separating [himself] from donuts first.\" Triumph also told non-English speakers that he could smell their crotch (in English). When one person walked away from the camera (with a string of curses), Triumph replied, \"You are in North America, learn the language!\" He also posted signs over existing street signs with such names as \"Rue de Pussies\", \"Celinedionsucks Street\", and \"Annemurraysabitch Avenue.\"\n\nIn June 2005, Triumph went to the Santa Maria courthouse where fans of Michael Jackson were awaiting the verdict in his 2005 trial for child molestation. \"Until the trial is over,\" reported Triumph, \"none of us can really know if Michael is innocent or guilty. But there is one thing we do know... he's guilty!\" Triumph also made fun of several foreigners supporting Jackson, including a Bulgarian man who was wearing a bright lime-green shirt. In front of the man there was a sign, stating \"the only victim is Michael,\" to which Triumph replied with, \"he's not the only fashion victim, I can see that!\", and, \"Tainted Love, 'bee bee boop', tainted love,\" implying the man was wearing a 1980s wardrobe. He suggested to a female fan that if she really wanted to get Michael's attention she should \"wear a nice dress, something low cut, maybe with a six year-old boy on your shoulder.\" Upon seeing a Michael Jackson impersonator sing and do the moonwalk, Triumph asked him if he could \"do Michael masturbating to \"Home Alone\".\" Also, when one woman mentioned that Michael was running late and came to court in his pajamas, Triumph gasped, \"He CAME in his pajamas?\" When another woman dressed as a clown refused to speak to Triumph, saying that she did not speak to puppets, Triumph responded, \"Right... wouldn't want to compromise your dignity, now would you?\"\n\nOn October 15, 2006, Triumph was the closing act for \"Night of Too Many Stars: An Overbooked Benefit for Autism Education\" at the Beacon Theater in New York. The show, aired on Comedy Central, was hosted by Jon Stewart and featured performances by Jerry Seinfeld, Adam Sandler, Jack Black, Will Ferrell, Steve Carell, Borat Sagdiyev and many other comics. Triumph sang \"Come Back\" with a group of singers introduced as Ladysmith Black Mambazo. \"Come Back\" was a plaintive chant bemoaning the loss of certain celebrities from the public eye. Sample lyrics:\n\n\"Come back Kathie Lee/I miss your sweatshops so cruel/And your Christmas shows were worse/than finding blood in my stool\"\n\n\"Dell Dude career/Please be reborn/You were big for a year/then it was back to gay porn\"\n\nTriumph also appeared as part of the 2010 Night of Too Many Stars, which was recorded on October 2 and aired on Comedy Central October 21. Triumph did a routine where he claimed to represent celebrity charities that were unable to be a part of the event. Triumph-autographed cigars were part of the subsequent online celebrity auction.\n\nIn June 2007, Triumph visited the Tony Awards red carpet, or as he described it, \"A Who's Who of Who Cares.\" Given that the already ratings-challenged Tonys were up against the final episode of \"The Sopranos\", Triumph tried to help out by providing \"more popular people\" to sneak into the show, including Abe Vigoda, Arena Football League player Aaron Garcia, and \"The Tuberculosis Guy\". Finally, Triumph suggested the Tonys incorporate fans more the way the MTV award shows do. He offered two \"matinee ladies\" (elderly fans who see Broadway matinees) who were willing to make out \"with tongue.\"\n\nIn September 2008, Triumph traveled to St. Paul, Minnesota to attend that year's Republican National Convention, where he filed a series of reports as he joked around with delegates inside the hall and protesters in the streets outside the convention. He also conducted a 6½-minute interview (at a hotel across the street) with independent candidate Ralph Nader.\n\nIn October 2008, Triumph made an appearance at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY during the final presidential debate between John McCain and Barack Obama. He interviewed and made jokes with political party supporters and with other members of the press, including the host of Fox News Channel's \"On the Record with Greta Van Susteren\", making a surprise appearance on her show with Mr. Met, the McCain-supporting mascot of the New York Mets.\n\nHe starred in the short-lived Adult Swim series \"The Jack and Triumph Show\", which premiered on February 20, 2015 and lasted until April 3, 2015.\n\nIn February 2016, Triumph starred in \"Triumph's Election Special 2016\", sponsored by Hulu and Funny or Die, traveling on the election trail. The program went on to be nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special. In November 2016, after the election of Donald Trump as president, Triumph appeared on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" to discuss Trump's victory.\n\nOther appearances include CBS Television Distribution's \"Hollywood Squares\" live in New York City in 2000, \"The Osbournes\", and Smigel's \"TV Funhouse\".\n\nTriumph made a cameo in the 2002 TV film \"It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie\", insulting Kermit the Frog. Kermit tells Triumph that he has to do with a little starpower around here, then Triumph tells him, \"Muppet movies are always the best... for me to poop on!\"\n\nIn November 2005, Triumph hosted \"Poopapalooza\" at the Flamingo Showroom in Las Vegas as the closing act of the initial \"The Comedy Festival\". Triumph pooped on various Las Vegas performers, including Cirque du Soleil-style gymnasts, \"The Neon Man\", and the Michael Jackson impersonator he'd met at the trial. There were also cameos by Jon Stewart, Penn & Teller, Lance Burton and Gilbert Gottfried.\n\nTriumph appeared as a guest on \"Space Ghost Coast to Coast\" in 2004, in the penultimate episode.\n\nIn 2006, Triumph made an appearance on \"Late Night\" celebrating the Chinese New Year being \"The Year of the Dog\", stating \"It's my year!\" and helping himself to various merchandise in New York City's Chinatown. He visited a butcher shop and vomited immediately upon tasting a Chinese delicacy. He also made an acupuncturist wear S&M gear.\n\nIn March 2006, G4 aired a special, \"The Best of Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog\", consisting of clips from Triumph's \"Best of...\" DVD. Triumph filmed short segments with Blackwolf the Dragonmaster for the special.\n\nOn November 3, 2006, O'Brien presented what appeared to be a clip of Triumph on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\". Triumph announced he'd been in Malawi and had adopted a puppy there. He thanked the female audience for their applause and told them they were all going to get vibrators with Oprah's face on them.\n\nOn November 14, 2006, Triumph was named an honorary member of the Las Vegas police department's K-9 dog unit. The next night he performed at the Celine Dion Theater, hosting \"Poopapalooza 2\" with Harland Williams, Jim Gaffigan and Frank Caliendo.\n\nIn September 2007, Triumph was interviewed by Dr. Phil (a mock interview on \"Late Night\") to discuss Triumph's lawsuit against Trouble Helmsley claiming that Trouble (Leona Helmsley's dog that inherited $12 million when Helmsley died) is the mother of his child. Triumph asserted that he and Trouble were friends for years, and had pictures to prove it: Triumph humping Trouble on the lawn of the Helmsley estate and in the lobby of the Helmsley Palace, and Triumph getting a hummer from Trouble at Tony Bennett's 80th birthday party. Triumph also brought out their alleged oldest child, Troubleina, and the youngest, named Leona \"after the dried-up wrinkly old bitch\". (The disposition of this lawsuit is not known.)\n\nShortly after the resolution of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, Triumph appeared at the WGA East Awards and lampooned many of the strike's key figures, as well as the controversy surrounding the decision of late night hosts (such as O'Brien and Jay Leno) to return to the air in violation of Guild rules: How about our negotiating committee? Where's their award? It couldn't have been easy for them, representing this freak show. Patric Verrone, John Bowman—you know what people don't know about these people? That they're great comedy writers. They are tremendous comedy writers. They've written hilarious material like \"Futurama\" and \"In Living Color\" and—the Writers Guild strike rules! The strike rules, ha, prohibit all the writing, ho ho, by any guild member that would be performed on-air by that member, ah ha ha ha, including monologues! Oh ho ho! I can't take it! It's too funny! Oh ho ho ho! The strike rules!\n\nBy the way, I want to say, you know, Jay Leno wasn't the only one to make a mockery of these rules. All the talk show hosts did, except my man, Conan O'Brien! Conan O'Brien went out there with no material and sucked harder than ever before!\n\nTriumph has also appeared as a judge on Comedy Central's \"The Gong Show with Dave Attell\".\n\nIn July 2008, Triumph attended the San Diego Comic-Con International, not only wandering the floor and speaking to many of the attendees, but also had a ten-minute skit at the start of the TV Funhouse presentation where, amongst the usual nerd-related gags, he implored everyone present to get to their feet and attempt a jumping jack.\n\nOn June 19, 2009, Triumph made his first appearance on \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\", serving as correspondent for the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee. He referred to festival-goers as dirty hippies on drugs. At the festival, he found a stark-naked Max Weinberg in a goer's tent.\n\nTriumph appeared on stage at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, alongside Zac Efron and Kiefer Sutherland to present Ben Stiller with the Generation Award.\n\nTriumph has also make a cameo appearance in \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" on the Director's Cut of \"Truth or Square\".\n\nTriumph appears in a prerecorded bit on O'Brien's 2010 Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour mocking the town O'Brien is performing in, even though NBC supposedly retained Triumph's rights in the settlement that allowed O'Brien to leave NBC. For comedic effect, information about the town is dubbed over. Triumph also gives obviously incorrect facts about the state, for example saying the state animal of Oregon is Chip Kelly.\n\nIn October 2011, Triumph appeared on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", when O'Brien and Fallon found him behind a pillow on the couch—O'Brien proclaimed he'd been there since the end of his \"Late Night\" run in 2009. He appeared almost a month later on the November 3 episode of \"Conan\", insulting protesters at the Occupy Wall Street movement. The segment aired on the fourth and final show O'Brien taped at the Beacon Theatre in New York City.\n\nIn June 2012, Triumph returned to \"Conan\" during the show's final episode broadcast from the historic Chicago Theatre. He, along with future co-star Jack McBrayer, traded vulgarities and insults with employees of The Wieners Circle in Chicago.\n\nIn April 2012, Triumph appeared on \"Conan\" as a reporter at the 2012 Golden Collar Awards. He interviewed and insulted the many dogs in attendance. This segment stands out as the first time Triumph has been taken apart; a dog tears Triumph to pieces and the segment ends with Triumph admitting defeat.\n\nIn October 2012, Triumph appeared on \"Conan\" again as a correspondent for the final presidential debate in Boca Raton, Florida between US president Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nIn April 2013, Triumph appeared on \"Conan\" in an informal interview he conducted with the \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\". After fooling them into thinking they were meeting O'Brien, Triumph insulted them on a wide range of topics from his disdain of reality television to his low opinion of their musical talent.\n\nIn October 2013, Triumph appeared on \"Conan\" again to report on his visit to the 2013 Microbrewery Expo in Colorado. He insulted visitors, brewery owners, and judges while sampling beer.\n\nIn June 2014, Triumph appeared on \"Conan\" again as a correspondent to the 2014 World Cup hosted in Brazil. His three-part series had him traveling to multiple New York City bars where he jeered and cheered with fans.\n\nTriumph appeared as a guest on during the Patchy the Pirate segments during the \"SpongeBob's Truth or Square\" special episode for the popular Nickelodeon series \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\n\nIn July 2016, Triumph crashed the set of \"CNN Tonight\" on the last night of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Triumph made fun of host Don Lemon and fellow CNN host Anderson Cooper.\n\nIn 2017, Triumph goes scorch into Trump's Inauguration and telling the crowd about his opinions on the politics.\n\nIn November 2018, Triumph made a couple of appearances on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, covering the 2018 U.S. midterms.\nTriumph went to Texas to interview Beto O'Rourke and Ted Cruz.\nHe came back a few days after the midterms to discuss the election results with Colbert.\n\nIn 1999, Pets.com filed a lawsuit against \"Late Night\" and Robert Smigel after Triumph repeatedly insisted citing the company's sock puppet mascot as being a \"rip-off\" of Triumph on several TV shows, print media and internet, and after Robert Smigel sent lawsuit threats and cease and desist letters to Pets.com claiming \"unfair competition, dilution and potentially tortious interference with contract in violation of federal and state laws\". However, the bankruptcy and closing of the company during the dot-com bust of 2000 ended the lawsuit. During an episode of Saturday Night Live, Triumph humped the Pets.com dog as an act of revenge in a bathroom.\n\nTriumph's 2003 album, \"Come Poop with Me\", was released by Warner Bros. Records, and featured adult comedy and songs, plus a bonus DVD of live performances by Triumph. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. Appearing with Triumph on the album and the DVD were singer-actor Jack Black, comic actor Adam Sandler, \"Saturday Night Live\" cast members Maya Rudolph and Horatio Sanz; Blackwolf the Dragonmaster—a real-life fantasy/gaming fan who had once been targeted by Triumph during an infamous encounter with \"Star Wars\" fans; and Conan O'Brien.\n\nOn August 10, 2004, NBC released a DVD, \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien: The Best of Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog\" featuring select Triumph appearances from \"Late Night\".\n\nIn Eminem's \"Ass Like That\", he uses the Triumph puppet to talk his way out of trouble with the police. Triumph himself appears in the video, once again insulting Eminem.\n\n\n"}
