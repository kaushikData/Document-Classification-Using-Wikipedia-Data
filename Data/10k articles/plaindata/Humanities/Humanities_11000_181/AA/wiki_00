He was one of the first scholars to study the Lepcha language.\n\nGrünwedel was born in Munich in 1856, the son of a painter. He studied art history and Asian languages, including Avestan, and in 1883 earned his doctorate at the University of Munich. In 1881 he began work as an assistant at the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin and in 1883 he was appointed deputy director of the ethnographic collection. Grünwedel won accolades for his numerous publications on Buddhist art, archaeology Central Asia, and Himalayan languages. Two notable works were \"Buddhist art in India\" (1893) and \"Mythology of Buddhism in Tibet and Mongolia\" (1900), which concerned the Greek origins of the Gandharan Greco-Buddhist artistic style and its development in Central Asia.\nIn 1899 Grünwedel was invited to join a Russian archaeological research expedition led by Vasily Radlov into the north of Xinjiang province, China. In the same year he was appointed a member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. In 1902-1903 Grünwedel led the first German expedition to Turpan, in Xinjiang, becoming the first modern European to study the massive ruins near Gaochang. He recorded the events of this expedition in his book \"Report on Archaeological work in Idikutschahri and Surrounding areas in Winter 1902-1903\" (1905). The next expedition was led by Albert von Le Coq, who became famous for removing large numbers of frescos from sites across Xinjiang. Grünwedel himself headed the third German Turfan expedition in 1905-1907, the results of which were published in \"Ancient Buddhist Religion in Chinese Turkistan\" (1912). Grünwedel's expeditions were largely funded by the Krupp family. Grünwedel was joined by Heinrich Lüders who made major contributions to the epigraphical analysis of the Turpan-Expedition findings after being called to the Friedrich-Wilhelms-University Berlin as Professor for oriental languages in 1909.\n\nGrünwedel retired in 1921, and in 1923 moved to Bavaria, where his spent his last years at Bad Tölz writing a number of scientific papers.

He is best known as the author of the 1959 book \"The Jewel in the Lotus\", the introduction to which was written by the noted sexologist and prolific writer, Albert Ellis. The book, named after a famous mantra, is an amassment of sexual curiosities apparently plucked from a variety of ethnographical and orientalist sources. Throughout the book, one finds a plethora of uncontrolled generalizations concerning the sexual behaviour of non-western populations. Doubt has been cast on the sincerity of its scholarship. A recent study accuses the author of \"more than a touch of prurience,\" and warns that \"the guise of orientalist scholarship clearly gives Edwardes leeway to express a surfeit of subconscious homoerotic phantasy.\" As such, the book is a curious and highly specific example of a more general tendency in Western scholarship—or, in this case, rather pseudo-scholarship—which has been criticized as 'Orientalism' (Edward Said).\n\nEdwardes, who was born in 1939 and was also known as D. A. Kinsley, wrote a number of other books as well, including racy biographies of Robert Clive and Richard Francis Burton. Kirkus Reviews judged the latter book, published in 1963, to be \"for sensation seekers and pseudo-intellectuals\".\n\n\n"}

A citizen of the United States since 2004, he has been a professor of literature and Latin American Studies at Duke University, in Durham, North Carolina, since 1985.\n\nDorfman was born in Buenos Aires on May 6, 1942, the son of Adolf Dorfman, who was born in Odessa (then Russian Empire) to a well-to-do Jewish family, and became a prominent Argentine professor of economics and the author of \"Historia de la Industria Argentina\", and Fanny Zelicovich Dorfman, who was born in Kishinev of Bessarabian Jewish descent. Shortly after his birth, they moved to the United States and then, in 1954, moved to Chile. He attended and later worked as a professor at the University of Chile, marrying Angélica Malinarich in 1966 and becoming a Chilean citizen in 1967. From 1968 to 1969, he attended graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley and then returned to Chile.\n\nSince the restoration of democracy in Chile, in 1990, he and his wife Angélica have divided their time between Santiago and the United States.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1973, Dorfman served as a cultural adviser to President Salvador Allende. During this time he wrote, with Armand Mattelart, a critique of North American cultural imperialism, \"How to Read Donald Duck\". Dorfman was supposed to work on the night shift at the La Moneda presidential palace the night before the Pinochet coup, but he had swapped his shift with his friend Claudio Jimeno, not knowing what was to come. Forced to leave Chile in 1973, after the coup by General Augusto Pinochet leading to President Allende's suicide, Dorfman went on to live in Paris, Amsterdam, and Washington, D.C. Since 1985 he has taught at Duke University, where he is currently Walter Hines Page Research Professor of Literature and Professor of Latin American Studies.\n\nDorfman was member of the Group of 88, a group of signatories of a controversial advertisement in \"The Chronicle\", Duke's student newspaper during the Duke lacrosse case.\n\nDorfman details his life of exile and bi-cultural living in his memoir, \"Heading South, Looking North\", which has been acclaimed by Elie Wiesel, Nadine Gordimer, Thomas Keneally and others.\n\nDorfman's work often deals with the horrors of tyranny and, in later works, the trials of exile. In an interview in \"BOMB Magazine\", Dorfman said, \"I'm constantly trying to figure out how you can be true to an experience which in fact very few people in the world would understand, such as having most of your friends disappear or be tortured, and at the same time finding a way of telling that story so other people in other places can read their own lives into that.\" His most famous play, \"Death and the Maiden\", describes the encounter of a former torture victim with the man she believed tortured her; it was made into a film in 1994 by Roman Polanski starring Sigourney Weaver and Ben Kingsley. Dorfman identified \"the stark, painful Chilean transition to democracy\" as \"Death and the Maiden\"'s central theme. The play received a 20th anniversary revival in the 2011–2012 season at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London's West End, directed by Jeremy Herrin and starring Thandie Newton, Tom Goodman-Hill, and Anthony Calf.\n\nHis thesis on the absurd in plays of Harold Pinter was published in Spanish as \"El absurdo entre cuatro paredes: el teatro de Harold Pinter\" \"(The absurd within four walls: the theater of Harold Pinter)\" by Editorial Universitaria, in Santiago, Chile, in 1968 (124 pages). Pinter later became a personal friend as well as an influence on Dorfman's work and political thinking.\n\nA critic of Pinochet, he has written extensively about the General's extradition case for the Spanish newspaper \"El País\" and other publications, and in the book \"Exorcising Terror: The Incredible Unending Trial of Gen. Augusto Pinochet.\" Rather than distinguishing between politics and art, Dorfman believes \"that one’s writing is deeply political,\" and, at its best, \"engages the major dilemmas...of the community.\"\n\nDorfman's works have been translated into more than 40 languages and performed in over 100 countries. Besides poetry, essays and novels— \"Hard Rain\", winner of the Sudamericana Award; \"Widows\"; \"The Last Song of Manuel Sendero\"; \"Mascara\"; \"Konfidenz\"; \"The Nanny and the Iceberg\", and Blake's \"Therapy\"—he has written short stories, including \"My House Is on Fire\", and general nonfiction including \"The Empire’s Old Clothes: What the Lone Ranger, Babar, and Other Innocent Heroes Do to Our Minds\". He has won various international awards, including two Kennedy Center Theater Awards. In 1996, with his son, Rodrigo, he received an award for best television drama in Britain for \"Prisoners in Time.\" His poems, collected in \"Last Waltz in Santiago\" and \"In Case of Fire in a Foreign Land\", have been turned into a half-hour fictional film, \"Deadline,\" featuring the voices of Emma Thompson, Bono, Harold Pinter, and others.\n\nDorfman's human rights play, \"Speak Truth to Power: Voices from Beyond the Dark\" (based on interviews with human rights defenders conducted by Kerry Kennedy Cuomo), premiered at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., in 2000, and subsequently aired on PBS as part of its \"Great Performances\" series. The play starred Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Alec Baldwin, and John Malkovich, among others, and was directed by Greg Mosher. It has gone on to numerous performances around the world, including a run in New York City. On May 3, 2010, a \"Speak Truth to Power\" benefit for survivors of the 2010 Chilean earthquake was put on by New York's Public Theater, directed by David Esbjornson, and featuring an all-star cast of Elias Koteas, Marcia Gay Harden, Alfred Molina, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen, Gloria Reuben, Paul Sorvino, Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci, and Debra Winger.\n\nDorfman's play \"The Other Side\" had its world premiere at the New National Theatre in Tokyo in 2004 and opened off-Broadway at the Manhattan Theater Club in 2005. Other recent plays include \"Purgatorio\" at the Seattle Rep in 2005 and at the Arcola Theatre in London in 2008; \"Picasso’s Closet,\" a counterfactual history in which the Nazis murder Picasso, had its premiere at Theater J in Washington, D.C. in 2006.\n\nHe is also the subject of a feature-length documentary, \"A Promise to the Dead\", based on his memoir \"Heading South, Looking North\" and directed by Peter Raymont. The film had its world premiere at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2007. In November 2007, the film was named by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as one of 15 films on its documentary feature Oscar shortlist. The list was narrowed to five films on January 22, 2008, and \"A Promise to the Dead\" was not among the five Oscar-nominated documentaries.\n\nHis latest works include the Lowell Thomas Award-winning travel book, \"Desert Memories\"; a collection of essays, \"Other Septembers, Many Americas\"; a novel he wrote with his youngest son, Joaquín, \"Burning City\"; \"Americanos: Los Pasos de Murieta\"; and a new volume of memoirs, \"Feeding on Dreams: Confessions of an Unrepentant Exile\". In 2007, his musical, \"Dancing Shadows\", opened in Seoul, Korea. This collaboration with Eric Woolfson, the principal composer for the Alan Parsons Project, won five Korean “Tony” awards. In 2011, his play \"Purgatorio\" has its Spanish language premiere at the Teatro Español in Madrid, starring Viggo Mortensen and Carme Elias.\n\nDorfman currently has several film projects in development with his sons, Rodrigo and Joaquin Dorfman, including a screen adaptation of his novel, \"Blake’s Therapy\".\n\nDorfman also writes regularly for such publications as \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The Guardian\" (where he has a featured blog), \"Le Monde\" and \"L'Unità\".\n\nHe is a member of \"L'Académie Universelle des Cultures\", in Paris, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It is a non-profit organization founded in Chicago, Illinois, on September 9, 1915, and incorporated in Washington, D.C. on October 2, 1915, as the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH) by Carter G. Woodson, William D. Hartgrove, George Cleveland Hall, Alexander L. Jackson, and James E. Stamps. The association is based in Washington, D.C. ASNLH was renamed the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History in 1973.\n\nASALH's official mission is \"to promote, research, preserve, interpret, and disseminate information about Black life, history, and culture to the global community.\"\n\nASALH's official vision is \" to be the premier Black Heritage and learned society with a diverse and inclusive membership supported by a strong network of national and international branches to continue the Woodson legacy.\"\n\nASALH created Negro History Week in 1926. Woodson selected the week to coincide with the birthdays of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln. Each year, Woodson established a national theme for the celebration. Since 1976, ASALH extended the celebration for the entire month of February.\n\nThe organization publishes \"The Journal of African American History\" (formerly \"The Journal of Negro History\"), and the \"Black History Bulletin\" (formerly the \"Negro History Bulletin\"). In 2005, ASALH established the ASALH Press, reissuing Carter G. Woodson's \"Mis-Education of the Negro.\" The same year ASALH established \"The Woodson Review,\" a magazine that promotes its Annual Black History Theme, including it as part of its Black History Kit. In 2005, ASALH discovered a previously unpublished manuscript by its founder, Carter G. Woodson, and published it in a special edition as \"Carter G. Woodson's Appeal: The Lost Manuscript Edition.\"\n\nASALH is a membership organization with over twenty-five branches.\n\nAnnually the organization strives to continue its research focus as well as efforts to share and disseminate historical information—for which the organization was founded. One of the major ways the organization focuses it resources in this area is with the ASALH annual convention that takes place in the fall (usually September or October.) ASALH hosted its first convention in 1917, two years after the organization was founded. At that time the convention was biennial. During the first convention Woodson stated the goals of the organization as he saw them. ‘The organization primary responsibilities would be the publishing of an historical magazine, researching the achievements of Negros, directing a home study program along with writing and publishing books and monographs. Charles Harris Wesley, one of the organization’s early developers, was not pleased with the first convention because more race solvers and educators attended than historians, which is in opposition to ASALH’s vision as an historical research society.’\n\nEach year, the location of the convention rotates to a major US city and coincides with the annual black history theme. The 2008 convention took place in Birmingham, AL and the 2009 convention took place in Cincinnati, OH. the 2010 convention was held in Raleigh, NC and the 2011 conference was held in Richmond, VA. The 2012 convention will be held from September 26- September 30 in Pittsburgh, PA. According to the Association, the annual convention draws over 1,000 participants.\n\nAt the convention ASALH organizes plenary sessions and workshops, facilitates scholarly presentations selected from the “Call for Papers,” sponsors a black history tour of famous landmarks in the city, and hosts a youth day for high school students in the area.\n\nNumerous organizations have risen out of the ASALH conventions. One such example is the Association of Black Women Historians (ABWH) founded at the 1977 ASALH convention in Washington, D.C. ABWH was founded by three women participants, Rosalyn Terbong-Penn, Eleanor Smith, and Elizabeth Parker.\n\nThe National Council of Black Studies was also conceptualized at an ASALH convention.\n\n"}

It is situated about one kilometer north of Highway 101, towards San Luis Potosí.\n\nThis Huastec site is located some north-west from the Las Flores Huastec archaeological site.\n\nAccording to paleontological and archaeological records, the earliest settlements in Tamaulipas are dated to twelve thousand years before the Christian era, and are identified in the so-called \"complex Devil\", in allusion to a Canyon of the Sierra of Tamaulipas. Later, at the Tropic of cancer level, are the first manifestations of native civilization, linked to the discovery and domestication of corn and thus to the beginning of agricultural life and the grouping of permanent settlements. As a result, in this period began to appear manifestations of Mesoamerican cultures in this region.\n\nBefore the arrival of the Spanish invaders, the Tamaulipas territory was occupied by various ethnic groups, one of them were the Wasteks. Américo Vespucio, famous Italian cartographer aftero whom the American continent was named, visited the Tamaulipas territory at the end of the 16th century and in his correspondence with Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco mentioned that the natives called the territory \"lariab\". During colonial times was known by other names: \"Kingdom Guasteca, province of Amichel and Earth Garayana, Pánuco province, Comarca of Paul, Alifau and Ocinan, Magdalena Medanos and \"New Santander\". The current name comes from the founding \"Tamaholipa\" by Fray Andrés de Olmos in 1544.\n\nIn Tamaulipas, the Huastecs settled primarily along the lower basin of the Guayalejo River-Tamesí and in mountain valleys of Tanguanchín (Ocampo) and Tammapul (Tula). Politically they did not seem to constitute a State, but rather a series of Lordships. They were skilled craftsmen and possessed a complex religious cosmogony, insomuch that in the Huasteca emerged the concept of the Quetzalcoatl deity. As a culture located in a peripheral area of nuclear Mesoamerica, they held a long autonomy until in the late postclassical period the Mexicas subjected them to their domain to a portion of the Huasteca.\n\nOther Huastec settlements with a great constructive work, are evident in the Balcón de Montezuma, an archaeological site located in the vicinity of the present capital of the State.\n\nThe Huastec culture large geographical development above is evident by the many sites scattered throughout the almost impenetrable mountains, as it is the case of the Sabinito, an interesting site currently in research, which speaks of an organized society of Mesoamerican type. However, there is evidence that during the postclassical period this cultural model was depleted, leaving the sierra inhabited by various groups of farmers, but of a lesser civilization level.\n\nIn the Tamaulipas sierras, three mesoamerican related archaeological phases are present; Laguna, Eslabones and Salta, covering a chronological period from 650 BCE to 1000 CE.\n\nIt had an initial cultural Pantheon defined by a constant evolution and the emergence of scattered villages between the sierra that concentrated up to 400 homes located around squares and platforms; and small circular base structures. But it was around 500 CE when this culture reached its peak, to expand urban concentrations up to a thousand houses, which formed villages in the peaks of the hills, with a central core of small pyramids. Simple urban planning suggests the existence of a possibly theocratic and centralized government, and pottery indicate trade with the nuclear area of Mesoamerica.\n\nThe Huastec, also known as Huaxtec, Wastek and Huastecos, are a native group of Mexico, historically based in the states of Hidalgo, Veracruz, San Luis Potosí and Tamaulipas concentrated along the route of the Pánuco River and along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe ancient Huastec culture is thought to date back to approximately the 10th century BCE, although their most productive period of civilization is usually considered to be the Postclassic era between the fall of Teotihuacan and the rise of the Aztec Empire. The Huastecs constructed temples on step-pyramids, carved independently-standing sculptures, and produced elaborately painted pottery.\n\nThe Huastecs attained an important culture and built cities, yet usually wore no clothing. They were admired for their abilities as musicians by other Mesoamerican peoples.\n\nThe Huastecs arrived in northern Mesoamerica between 1500 BCE and 900 BCE. The linguistic evidence is corroborated by archaeological discoveries. In 1954, Richard Stockton MacNeish found ceramics and figurines from the mid-preclassical (Formative) period, called \"Pavon de Panuco\" in the Panuco River sites of the Huasteca, which resemble preclassical period objects from Uaxactun, a Petén-region Maya site. A date not earlier than 1100 BCE for the Huastecs’ arrival at their present location seems most likely, since they probably did not arrive at the north-central Veracruz site of Santa Luisa until about 1200 BCE, the phase at the end of the early preclassical period known locally as the \"Ojite phase\". Artifacts of the period include Panuco-like basalt \"manos\" and \"metates\". The Huastecs remained in Santa Luisa, located east of Papantla near the Gulf coast, until supplanted or absorbed by the Totonacs around 1000 CE.\n\nThe Wastek or Huastec language is a Mayan language of Mexico, spoken by the Huastecs. Though relatively isolated from them, it is related to the Mayan languages spoken further south and east in Mexico and Central America.\n\nThe language is called Teenek (with varying spellings) by its speakers, and this name has gained currency in Mexican national and international usage in recent years.\n\nThe now-extinct Chicomuceltec language is believed to have been most closely related to Wastek.\n\nThe first linguistic description of the Huastec language accessible to Europeans was written by Andrés de Olmos, who also wrote the first grammatical descriptions of Nahuatl and Totonac.\n\nThe name Tamaulipas () is probably derived from Tamaholipa, a Huastec term in which the \"tam-\" prefix signifies \"place where.\" As yet, there is no scholarly agreement on the meaning of \"holipa\", the native population of Tamaulipas, now extinct, was referred to as the \"Olives\"\n\nTamaulipas probably means \"Montes Altos\" (high hills). Another version states that means \"Place of olives\", natives originating in Florida, USA.\n\nThis site was explored and restored between 1989 and 1990, by archaeologist Jesus Nárez. Based on the research, it is known that ancient houses found at the site—hut style with palm roofs—were built on top of the circular bases while their dead was buried under the floors. In the 1980s numerous human skeletal remains were found, both children and adults.\n\nBalcón de Montezuma is representative of small farming villages of the sierra that originated in the Late Classic period (600–900 CE) of Mesoamerican chronology.\n\nThis site represents a village (400–1200CE) composed of around 90 circular bases distributed in two plazas; and is located in the Sierra Madre Oriental range, at an altitude of above mean sea level.\n\nThe site contains vestiges and architectonic styles of human groups that inhabited the Sierra Madre Oriental (Sierra Gorda) region and the Sierra de Tamaulipas, whose culture and the Mesoamerican profile shares features of the Huastec culture and the Southwestern United States.\n\nIt should be noted that so far no representations of their gods has been found, nor it is known if any of the buildings functioned as temples. The original entrance to the site was via a large stairway of more than 80 steps located on the western hillside; it was built as an adaptation to natural limestone hill protrusions.\n\nThe site comprises more than 70 circular structures of different diameters and heights grouped into two small semi-circular plazas. These bases were built with limestone, overlaid without mortar, the core is made up of dirt, small stones and pottery remains. The site displays unique characteristics, such as a small stairway with 3 to 4 steps, recessed or superimposed, with a fan-shaped base. It is thought that the bases were houses circular foundations, with \"bajareque\" walls and palm leaf roofs.\n\nThe archaeological remains have traces of stone slabs paved surfaces.\n\nArchaeological material found at the site revealed practices of its people such as smoking pipes, using crystal quartz – perhaps as amulets-, necklaces, stone disks and burial of the dead under the floor of the House, accompanied by ceramic offerings.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1250381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1250381", "title": "Bimbo", "text": "Bimbo\n\nBimbo is a slang term for a well-built, attractive, somewhat dim woman. The term was originally used in the United States as early as 1919 for an unintelligent or brutish male.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, the \"stereotypical bimbo\" appearance became that of an attractive woman, often blond and with a curvaceous figure and large breasts, possibly wearing heavy makeup and revealing clothing. It is also associated with \"the dumb blonde\" stereotype.\n\nThe word bimbo derives itself from the Italian \"bimbo\", a masculine-gender term that means \"(male) baby\" or \"young (male) child\" (the feminine form of the Italian word is \"bimba\"). Use of this term began in the United States as early as 1919, and was a slang word used to describe an unintelligent or brutish man, like in Portuguese.\n\nIt was not until the 1920s that the term bimbo first began to be associated with females. In 1920, Frank Crumit, Billy Jones, and Aileen Stanley all recorded versions of \"My Little Bimbo Down on the Bamboo Isle\", with words by Grant Clarke and music by Walter Donaldson, in which the term \"bimbo\" is used to describe an island girl of questionable virtue. The 1929 silent film \"Desert Nights\" describes a wealthy female crook as a bimbo and in \"The Broadway Melody\", an angry Bessie Love calls a chorus girl a \"bimbo\". The first use of its female meaning cited in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" is dated 1929, from the scholarly journal \"American Speech\", where the definition was given simply as \"a woman\".\n\nIn the 1940s, bimbo was still being used to refer to both men and women, as in, for example the comic novel \"Full Moon\" by P.G. Wodehouse who wrote of “bimbos who went about the place making passes at innocent girls after discarding their wives like old tubes of toothpaste”.\n\nThe term died out again for much of the 20th century until it became popular again in the 1980s, with political sex scandals. As bimbo began to be used increasingly for females, exclusively male variations of the word began to surface, like mimbo and himbo, a backformation of bimbo, which refers to an unintelligent but attractive man.\n\nThe term is sometimes associated with men or women who dye their hair blond, indicating that physical attractiveness is more important to them than other, non-physical traits and as an extension to \"the dumb blonde\" stereotype.\n\n\n\n\nIn American politics, the word was used in the 1990s during Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct allegations, leading to the invention of the term \"Bimbo eruptions\" to refer to political sex scandals. The expression was also used in a 2014 report in which Colin Powell explained his reluctance to vote for Hillary Clinton in light of her husband's continued affairs with \"bimbos\".\n\nAfter the first 2015 Republican Presidential Debate, Donald Trump re-tweeted a message calling debate moderator and Fox News host Megyn Kelly a \"bimbo\" via Twitter.\nThis took place after Kelly asked Trump a question that referenced his television show The Apprentice from season 6 in 2005 Shortly afterwards, Stephen Richter of The Globalist published an opinion piece in which he accused Trump of being a bimbo, noting the original definition of bimbo as 'an unintelligent or brutish male'.\n\n(stupid or foolish person):\nAnd one had to remember that most of\nthe bimbos to whom Roberta Wickham had been giving the bird through\nthe years had been of the huntin', shootin' and fishin' type, fellows who had\nmore or less shot their bolt after saying 'Eh, what?' and slapping their leg\nwith a hunting crop.\nIsn't he the bimbo who took the\nbread out of the mouths of the Thursday Review people? Chuck the\nblighter out of the window and we want to see him bounce.\n\n\n"}

He would go on to become assistant professor in 1960, associate professor with tenure in 1962, and full professor in 1966. In 1989 Watkins was appointed to the position of Victor. S Thomas Professor of Linguistics and Classics. Linguists influenced by Watkins during his tenure at Harvard include Goddard, Jasanoff, D. Gary Miller, Michael Silverstein, Alice Harris, H. Craig Melchert, Alan Nussbaum, Brent Vine, Mark Hale, Andrew Garrett, Joshua Katz and Benjamin Fortson.\n\nWatkins remained dedicated to the research and development of historical linguistics throughout his entire academic and professional career. In 1982 he was a founding member of the \"East Coast Indo-European Conference\" in which he participated in a large majority of it's annual meetings.\n\nUpon his retirement from Harvard in 2003, Watkins moved to Los Angeles, California and began teaching at the University of California, Los Angeles alongside his wife, Stephanie Jamison. Watkins would continue to promote the importance of historical linguistics at UCLA by remaining active in the annual UCLA Indo-European Conference. In 2013, the 25th annual conference was dedicated to the memory of Watkins.\n\nHis doctoral dissertation at Harvard University, \"Indo-European Origins of the Celtic Verb I\". \"The Sigmatic Aorist\" (Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1962), which deeply reflected the structuralist approach of Jerzy Kuryłowicz, opened a fresh era of creative work in Celtic comparative linguistics and the study of the verbal system of Indo-European languages.\n\nWatkins, in a sense, completed his contribution to this area with his \"Indogermanische Grammatik\", vol. 3, part 1: \"Geschichte der indogermanischen Verbalflexion\" (1969). Meanwhile, his work on Indo-European vocabulary and poetics yielded a large number of articles on (among others) Celtic, Anatolian, Greek, Italic and Indo-Iranian material, presented directly in his \"Selected Writings\" and indirectly in his book, \"How to Kill a Dragon: Aspects of Indo-European Poetics\" (Oxford University Press, 1995).\n\nHe contributed his expertise on Indo-European languages to the first edition of \"The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language\" and edited \"The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots\"().\n\n\"\" was published on November 16, 1995 through Oxford University Press and attempted to establish a formulaic method of comparative linguistics which exemplified the importance of the poetic formula in order to better trace the development of Indo-European languages by working backwards and identifying patterns from their mother language, Proto-Indo-European. The book is divided into two main halves, the first of which acts as a definition and introduction the study of Indo-European poetics which is expanded upon by implementing Watkins' idea of the \"dragon-slaying myth\" and defending this concept through a number of case studies involving languages connected by a common theme. Watkins expands upon the \"dragon-slaying myth\" in part two of the text by offering new research into his proposed formula of \"HERO SLAY SERPENT\", he also attempts to reconstruct an example of Proto-Indo-European through the comparative method of historical linguistics.\n\n\"Lingua Franca\" reviewer Marc L'Heureux commented that Watkins also implements historical evidence to favor the development of language such as the relationship between the patron and the poet. He further opined that through the ceremonious delivery from the poet, the word choices became preserved as historical evidence of the language in question. Thus the poet was not only a wielder of great power, according to Watkins as the patron's prestige was inherently tied to the poet's prowess, but a recorder of language that has allowed for research to be conducted in order to better understand the developement of ancient languages.\n\n\"How to Kill a Dragon\" received favorable acclaim and is now considered to be a definitive text which transformed the study of Indo-European poetics. \"How to Kill a Dragon\" earned Watkins the 1998 Goodwin Award for Classical Studies.\n\n\nCalvert Watkins died in his sleep at the age of 80 in Los Angeles, California on March 20, 2013. He was the Distinguished Professor in Residence of the Department of Classics and the Program in Indo-European Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he had moved in 2003 after retiring from Harvard University as Victor S. Thomas Professor of Linguistics and the Classics.\n\n\n"}

When two variants are in complementary distribution, one can predict when each will occur because one can simply look at the environment in which the allophone is occurring. \n\nComplementary distribution is commonly applied to phonology in which similar phones in complementary distribution are usually allophones of the same phoneme. For instance, in English, and are allophones of the phoneme because they occur in complementary distribution. always occurs when it is the syllable onset and followed by a stressed vowel (as in the word \"pin\"). occurs in all other situations (as in the word \"spin\").\n\nThere are cases of elements being in complementary distribution but not being considered allophones. For example, English and are in complementary distribution: occurs only at the beginning of a syllable and only at the end. However, because they have so little in common in phonetic terms, they are still considered separate phonemes.\nThe concept of complementary distribution is applied in the analysis of word forms (morphology). Two different word forms (allomorphs) can actually be different \"faces\" of one and the same word (morpheme). An example is the English indefinite articles \"a\" and \"an\". The usages \"an aardvark\" and \"a bear\" are grammatical, but the usages \"*a aardvark\" and \"*an bear\" are ungrammatical (as is marked with \"*\" in linguistics).\n\nThe forms \"an\" and \"a\" work together like a team and take care of every instance (environment) in which the English indefinite article is used, i.e. there are two different \"forms\" of the same \"word\" instead of two different words.\n\n"}

Detransitioning is also termed retransitioning.\n\nSome people detransition after feeling that transitioning caused more problems than it solved, citing reasons including inability to bond with people, concern regarding the health implications of high doses of hormones, the way in which people responded to a trans man, a constant, low level of groin pain, and sexual inability. A person, who subsequently detransitioned, said that he struggled with gender identity after eight years of living as a woman, with no lasting peace, and a worsening of \"gender confusion\".\n\nIn September 2017, the Australian \"60 Minutes\" television program featured a 12-year-old who transitioned as a girl and two years later detransitioned.\n\nA review of more than 100 international medical studies of post-operative transsexuals by the University of Birmingham found no robust scientific evidence that sex reassignment surgery is clinically effective. However, some studies find that sex reassignment surgery improves the quality of life of most of those who undergo it.\n\nGenital reconstructive surgeon Miroslav Dordevic said that some transgender people regret having undergone the procedure and want to detransition. He said that this is particularly so for transgender women over 30, and that there is a \"taboo\" in talking about issues relating to \"regret\".\n\nIn August 2017, the Philadelphia-based Mazzoni Center's Trans Health Conference, which is an annual meeting of transgender people, advocates, and health care providers, canceled a panel discussion on detransitioning. The conference organisers said, \"When a topic becomes controversial, such as this one has turned on social media, there is a duty to make sure that the debate does not get out of control at the conference itself. After several days of considerations and reviewing feedback, the planning committee voted that the workshops, while valid, cannot be presented at the conference as planned\".\nIn September 2017, Bath Spa University refused permission for James Caspian, a counsellor who specialises in transgender therapy, to undertake research relating to people who had decided to reverse their gender reassignment operations. Caspian alleged that the reason for the refusal was that it was, \"a potentially politically incorrect piece of research [which] carries a risk to the university\".\n\nIt is asserted that there is a lack of legal, medical and psychological assistance for those seeking to detransition.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "41052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41052", "title": "Distortion", "text": "Distortion\n\nDistortion is the alteration of the original shape (or other characteristic) of something. In communications and electronics it means the alteration of the waveform of an information-bearing signal, such as an audio signal representing sound or a video signal representing images, in an electronic device or communication channel. Distortion is usually unwanted, and so engineers strive to eliminate or minimize it. In some situations, however, distortion may be desirable. For example, in FM broadcasting and noise reduction systems like the Dolby system, an audio signal is deliberately distorted in ways that emphasize aspects of the signal that are subject to electrical noise, then it is symmetrically \"undistorted\" after passing through a noisy communication channel, reducing the noise in the signal. Distortion is also used as a musical effect, particularly with electric guitars.\n\nThe addition of noise or other outside signals (hum, interference) is not considered distortion, though the effects of quantization distortion are sometimes included in noise. A quality measure that explicitly reflects both the noise and the distortion is the signal-to-noise-and-distortion (SINAD) ratio.\n\nIn telecommunication and signal processing, a noise-free system can be characterised by a transfer function, such that the output formula_1 can be written as a function of the input formula_2 as\n\nWhen the transfer function comprises only a perfect gain constant \"A\" and perfect delay \"T\"\n\nthe output is undistorted. Distortion occurs when the transfer function \"F\" is more complicated than this. If \"F\" is a linear function, for instance a filter whose gain and/or delay varies with frequency, the signal suffers linear distortion. Linear distortion does not introduce new frequency components to a signal but does alter the balance of existing ones.\n\nThis diagram shows the behaviour of a signal (made up of a square wave followed by a sine wave) as it is passed through various distorting functions.\n\n\nThe transfer function of an ideal amplifier, with perfect gain and delay, is only an approximation. The true behavior of the system is usually different. Nonlinearities in the transfer function of an active device (such as vacuum tubes, transistors, and operational amplifiers) are a common source of non-linear distortion; in passive components (such as a coaxial cable or optical fiber), linear distortion can be caused by inhomogeneities, reflections, and so on in the propagation path.\n\nAmplitude distortion is distortion occurring in a system, subsystem, or device when the output amplitude is not a linear function of the input amplitude under specified conditions.\n\nHarmonic distortion adds overtones that are whole number multiples of a sound wave's frequencies. Nonlinearities that give rise to amplitude distortion in audio systems are most often measured in terms of the harmonics (overtones) added to a pure sinewave fed to the system. Harmonic distortion may be expressed in terms of the relative strength of individual components, in decibels, or the root mean square of all harmonic components: Total harmonic distortion (THD), as a percentage. The level at which harmonic distortion becomes audible depends on the exact nature of the distortion. Different types of distortion (like crossover distortion) are more audible than others (like soft clipping) even if the THD measurements are identical. Harmonic distortion in radio frequency applications is rarely expressed as THD.\n\nNon-flat frequency response is a form of distortion that occurs when different frequencies are amplified by different amounts in a filter. For example, the non-uniform frequency response curve of AC-coupled cascade amplifier is an example of frequency distortion. In the audio case, this is mainly caused by room acoustics, poor loudspeakers and microphones, long loudspeaker cables in combination with frequency dependent loudspeaker impedance, etc.\n\nThis form of distortion mostly occurs due to electrical reactance. Here, all the components of the input signal are not amplified with the same phase shift, hence making some parts of the output signal out of phase with the rest of the output.\n\nCan be found only in dispersive media. In a waveguide, phase velocity varies with frequency. In a filter, group delay tends to peak near the cut-off frequency, resulting in pulse distortion. When analog long distance trunks were commonplace, for example in 12 channel carrier, group delay distortion had to be corrected in repeaters.\n\nAs the system output is given by y(t) = F(x(t)), then if the inverse function F can be found, and used intentionally to distort either the input or the output of the system, then the distortion is corrected.\n\nAn example of a similar correction is where LP/vinyl recordings or FM audio transmissions are deliberately pre-emphasised by a linear filter, the reproducing system applies an inverse filter to make the overall system undistorted.\n\nCorrection is not possible if the inverse does not exist—for instance if the transfer function has flat spots (the inverse would map multiple input points to a single output point). This produces an uncorrectable loss of information. Such a situation can occur when an amplifier is overdriven—causing clipping or slew rate distortion when, for a moment, the amplifier characteristics alone and not the input signal determine the output.\n\nMany symmetrical electronic circuits reduce the magnitude of even harmonics generated by the non-linearities of the amplifier's components, by combining two signals from opposite halves of the circuit where distortion components that are roughly the same magnitude but out of phase. Examples include push-pull amplifiers and long-tailed pairs.\n\nIn binary signaling such as FSK, distortion is the shifting of the significant instants of the signal pulses from their proper positions relative to the beginning of the start pulse. The magnitude of the distortion is expressed in percent of an ideal unit pulse length. This is sometimes called 'bias' distortion.\n\nTelegraphic distortion is a similar older problem, distorting the ratio between \"mark\" and \"space\" intervals. \n\nIn the art world, a distortion is any change made by an artist to the size, shape or visual character of a form to express an idea, convey a feeling or enhance visual impact. Often referred to as \"abstraction,\" examples of distortion include \"The Weeping Woman\" by Picasso and \"The Adoration of the Shepherds\" by El Greco.\n\nIn this context, distortion refers to any kind of deformation of an output waveform compared to its input, usually clipping, harmonic distortion, or intermodulation distortion (mixing phenomena) caused by non-linear behavior of electronic components and power supply limitations. Terms for specific types of nonlinear audio distortion include: crossover distortion, slew-Induced Distortion (SID) and transient intermodulation (TIM).\n\nDistortion in music is often intentionally used as an effect when applied to an electric guitar signal in styles of rock music such as heavy metal and punk rock (see also overdrive and distortion synthesis). Other forms of audio distortion that may be referred to are non-flat frequency response, compression, modulation, aliasing, quantization noise, wow and flutter from analog media such as vinyl records and magnetic tape. The human ear cannot hear phase distortion, except that it may affect the stereo imaging. (See also: Audio system measurements.)\n\nIn most fields, distortion is characterized as unwanted change to a signal.\n\nIn optics, image/optical distortion is a divergence from rectilinear projection caused by a change in magnification with increasing distance from the optical axis of an optical system.\n\nIn cartography, a distortion is the misrepresentation of the area or shape of a feature. The Mercator projection, for example, distorts by exaggerating the size of regions at high latitude.\n\n"}

{"id": "3503286", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3503286", "title": "Eastern Pomo language", "text": "Eastern Pomo language\n\nEastern Pomo, also known as Clear Lake Pomo, is a nearly extinct Pomoan language spoken around Clear Lake in Lake County, California by one of the Pomo peoples.\n\nIt is not mutually intelligible with the other Pomoan languages. Prior to contact with Europeans, it was spoken along the northern and southern shores of Clear Lake to the north of San Francisco, and in the coast mountains west of Sacramento Valley. Eastern Pomo shared borders in the north with the Patwin and the Yuki languages, in the south with the Lake Wappo, the Wappo, the Southeastern Pomo, the Southern Pomo, the Central Pomo, the Northern Pomo, and the Lake Miwok. They also shared a border to the west with the Northern Pomo.\n\nThe southern and northern areas in which Eastern Pomo was spoken were geographically separate, and apparently represented differing dialects,split by certain lexical and phonological differences. Contemporary Eastern Pomo speakers refer to the north shore dialect area as Upper Lake, and the south shore dialect area as Big Valley.\n\nA documentation project for the language, which had not been written down, started in 2003 at the Big Valley Rancheria. As of 2006, 59-year-old Loretta Kelsey was the one remaining Elem Pomo speaker, or \"language keeper\". A podcast interview is available which features Kelsey speaking the language. Although Kelsey is teaching younger speakers, it is not clear whether the language can be maintained based on her knowledge. In 2008, Kelsey, the daughter of a former tribal chief, was disenrolled from the tribe along with 24 family members, despite having \"lived on the rancheria for most of her 59 years.\" Downloads of Elem Pomo documentation are available from the electronic repository of the California Indian Museum and Cultural Center.\n\nEastern Pomo has five vowels, which all occur both short and long. The vowels , , and are all unrounded vowels (respectively high, mid, and low), and the vowels and are rounded vowels (high and mid, respectively). In many linguistic descriptions of Eastern Pomo, Americanist phonetic notation is used, and a mid-dot represents long vowels: a· e· i· o· u·.\n\nThere are no occasions in Eastern Pomo where multiple vowels appear in sequence within the same syllable. There is one occasion where two vowels are in sequence across a syllable boundary, and that is in the word , meaning 'toward where' or 'whither.' Also, vowels do not occur word-initially in Eastern Pomo.\n\nEastern Pomo has thirty-eight consonants. The voiceless plosives have a three-way distinction for each point of articulation: unaspirated (plain), aspirated, and ejective. The plosives also distinguish between lamino-dental and apico-alveolar points of articulation for each series, transcribed and respectively. is pronounced as an affricate, , in word-initial position, and as a voiceless palatal plosive, , in word-medial position. is a laminal pre-palatal fricative, while represents , an apico-alveolar fricative, with a slightly retroflexed tongue tip. In linguistic publications using Americanist phonetic notation the alveolar plosive series is distinguished from the dental one with the addition of under-dots: ṭ ṭʰ ṭ’; the palatal consonants are written č čʰ č’ š; the alveolar affricates are written c cʰ c’; and the voiceless nasals, semivowels, and liquid are written using capital letters: M N W Y L.\n\nThere are a number of restrictions on the distribution of the various phonemes. , , and are relatively rare in Eastern Pomo. Voiceless unaspirated (plain) stops; voiced stops; voiceless nasals, semi-vowels, and voiceless ; and the fricative never occur in word-final position. never occurs before , and very rarely before and . only occurs at the beginning of syllables, and only occurs word-initially before and in words borrowed from Spanish. The voiceless nasals don't occur before the vowels and .\n\nThe various pronunciations of the rhotic are complex. Syllable-finally, it as a voiced alveolar trill, , though word-finally, it has a fricative release. Word-medially, it is a voiced alveolar flap, . It is more frequently found initially in unstressed syllables than in stressed syllables, and occurs most commonly in syllable- and word-final position.\n\nThe most common syllable structure used is a two-syllable form, CV:CV(:)(C)(C), with primary stress on the second syllable (where \"C\" represents a consonant, \"V\" represents a vowel, \":\" represents vowel length, and items enclosed in parentheses indicate that the position is optionally filled). An example of this is , \"maggots to move around on something; many blackbirds to be in a field.\" In word-medial position, the syllable boundary falls before the final consonant in a sequence. For example, the structure [CV(:)(C)(C)(:)] is used for non-final syllables in words. Non-final syllables in words will end in C, CC, C:, or CC: only if another syllable beginning with a consonant follows. Word-final syllables can take the shape CV:CC.\n\nThe following words illustrate possible syllable shapes for words in Eastern Pomo: \n\nVowels do not occur in sequence (VV) within a syllable, nor across syllable boundaries. Sequences of two or more consonants within a syllable only occur at the end of a syllable, not initially. For example, , 'knock something (as acorns, fruit) off something (as tree)', shows a two consonant cluster in word-final position. \n\nAcross syllable boundaries in the middle of a word, it is common for there to be two-consonant sequences without restrictions, except that unaspirated stops, voiced stops, voiceless nasals, voiceless semi-vowels, and don't occur syllable-finally.\n\nAll roots carry primary stress. Most words begin with a two-syllable sequence of the sort, CV:CV (with primary stress on the V). The roots of polysyllabic words cannot always be isolated in this language, making it impossible to predict where the primary stress is going to fall solely on the type of morpheme. However, primary stress does occur on the second syllable of most words, including the words in which the roots cannot be isolated.\n\nThe weakest degree of stress falls on a syllable following a primarily or secondarily stressed syllable, and alternates on the following syllables. The syllables following the primarily stressed syllable alternates with every second syllable being slightly louder than the preceding unstressed syllable, but not as loud as the primarily or secondarily stressed syllable. \n\nSecondary stress occurs when a word contains two or more primary stressed syllables, in which case all but one primary stress is reduced to secondary. There are exceptions in certain syllables that are always secondarily stressed, regardless of the alternating pattern of lightly and heavily stressed syllables following the primarily stressed syllable. This type of secondary stress is included as part of the morpheme. Suffixes that have this type of stress include 'plural habitual', and 'sentence connective'.\n\nHere are some examples of phonologically conditioned variation within the Eastern Pomo language involving one of the three processes: vowel harmony, consonant ablaut, or consonant and vowel deletion. \n\nVowel Harmony: This process affects the two high vowels, and . The vowel lowers to become the mid vowel in instrumental prefixes. The vowel lowers to become the mid vowel if followed by or and another .\n\nConsonant Ablaut: This process affects aspirated stops (plosives) except , and the fricative . When aspirated stops are in morpheme-final position, and are followed by a morpheme beginning with a vowel, the aspirated stops (other than ) deaspirate to become the corresponding unaspirated stops, and becomes . For example, , 'two', becomes , 'two (things)'; and , 'to shoot' becomes , '(someone) shot something'. \n\nDeletion: This process affects suffixes beginning with the vowels or , or with the consonants or : \n\nThe most important processes of Eastern Pomo morphology are suffixation and prefixation. There are half as many morphemes that serve as prefixes than suffixes. Other processes used are reduplication and compounding. The verbal or non-verbal function of a morphological unit is specified by the addition of inflectional suffixes, and/or syntactic relations. The inflectional suffixes fall into categories creating morphological classes; mainly, verbs, animates, substantives, and four minor classes, adverbial indefinites, locatives, directionals and directional preverbs. There are also uninflecteds, which include proper names, interjections and syntactic particles.\n\nVerbs are morphologically the most complex and syntactically the most important. There are eight optional position classes of suffixes for verbs, specifying categories of aspect, mode, plurality, locality, reciprocity, source of information (evidentials), and forms of syntactic relations. Stems may be inflected as a verb by means of suffixation, prefixation and reduplication.\n\nAnimates have two subclasses, pronouns and kinship terms. They are inflected for subject, object, genitive, and comitative through the processes of suffixation and partial suppletion. Kinship terms distinguish between a person's own relative and another person's relative by means of suffixation and suppletion, and occur with two sets of possessive pronominal prefixes.\n\nSubstantives have five subclasses, personal nouns, adjectives, nouns, demonstratives, and numerals. They are inflected for noun aspect. Nouns are inflected for possession and commitation, while personal nouns and adjectives are inflected for plurality through suffixation and suppletion.\n\nUninflecteds include proper nouns, interjections and syntactic particles. The basic morphological unit is the stem, which can be either common or unanalyzable. \n\nCommon stems have a root with the canonical shape CV’(:). The difference between common stems and unanalyzable stems is that commons stems can include an additional single position class of instrumental prefixes with the shape CV(·)-, and/or a member of one or both of two position classes of manner suffixes, with the shape -C, -CC, or . A common stem is often used to apply to a variety of situations, which may not be formally associated in the typical English perspective. For example, \"si·qál\", meaning both, 'pure, clean, all of one kind, homogeneous' and 'lick something like ice cream off fingers.' These two situations are distinguished through verbal and extra-linguistic context. And at the same time, a single event can be described by a variety of stems depending on what aspect of the act is in focus. \n\nUnanalyzable stems consist of a longer sequence of phonemes than roots, such as CVC, or CVCV. Some of these unanalyzable stems are borrowed from Spanish, such as \"pášalʔ\", 'to visit, a visit'.\n\nPosition Classes of Suffixes (Non-verb)\n\nPosition Classes of Suffixes (Verbs)\n\nAn example of derivational suffixes are the gender suffixes, {-p’} for the masculine gender, and {-t’} for the feminine gender.\n\nThere are 18 frequently used instrumental prefixes in Eastern Pomo, which are used to indicate how something was done. An example of one of the frequent forms is {da} meaning 'with or affecting the hand'. It is seen in the word \"da·kʰó·\", meaning 'grab at something, steady something with hand, catch with hand'.\n\nStem reduplication signifies different types of distributiveness, meaning that the action affects many individuals or creates many distributed results. There are four types in Eastern Pomo: \nIt is clear that the reduplicated sequence comes after the base stem because of the fact that the primary stress associated with all roots is not reduplicated in the process. The amount of distributiveness is determined by the number of morphemes involved in the reduplication. For example, in the first type of reduplication, only the root is copied, and only its meaning is affected. In the second type, the root and a manner suffix are reduplicated, and both of their meanings are affected.\n\nFor example, in the word \"mi·ṭʰi’ṭʰik’i·l\", meaning 'kick something along, a little way at a time,' where only the root is reduplicated, it is possible that only one toe is used to do the kicking. The motion of spreading, as indicated in the phrase 'a little way at a time,' is the part that is distributed.\n\nWord order is not fixed, but predictable, in the Eastern Pomo language. Verbs are the head of the clause, and typically the final word in that clause. Generally, the order preceding the verb begins with an optional adverbial or locative complement, then the subject, object, instrument, and possibly another adverbial or locative complement.\n\nThe position of the agent is morphologically specified by one of the three suffixes: {-là·}, {-u·là·}, or {-yeʔèkʰ}. \n\nThe relation of instruments is marked by the suffix {-yay} when a morphologically marked subject and object are in the clause as well. The locative suffixes used to mark the locative complement are: {-w}, {-xa·m}, {-da}, {-a·ma·}, {-ya}, {-Na}, or {-iday}.\n\nThere is a syntactic relation of possession or dependency between the members of a phrase and the head of a phrase. Possession is marked morphologically by the genitive suffix {-bax} or a possessive pronoun:\n\nDependency is not morphologically marked, but is interpreted through paraphrasing or dropping words.\n\nGrammatical evidentiality is expressed by four evidential suffixes that are added to verbs: \"-ink’e\" (nonvisual sensory), \"-ine\" (inferential), \"-·le\" (hearsay), \"-ya\" (direct knowledge):\n\nEastern Pomo, like the other Pomoan languages, exhibits a system of switch-reference, whereby suffixes are used to mark whether a clause has the same or a different subject from the preceding clause. The suffixes also mark temporal, causative, and other distinctions. The switch-reference suffixes of Eastern Pomo are given in the table below:\n\nAn example of one of the switch-reference markers in context is the sentence há· xá· qákkiqan, wi q’a·lál ṭá·la, \"I took a bath, so [same subject] I got sick\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Created around the year 515 BC, it is the only complete example of the surviving 27 vases painted by the renowned Euphronios and is considered one of the finest Greek vase artifacts in existence. Part of the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1972 to 2008, the vase was repatriated to Italy under an agreement negotiated in February 2006, and is now in the collection of the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning works of art to their place of origin.\n\nThe Euphronios krater stands 45.7 cm (18 inches) in height and has a diameter of 55.1 cm (21.7 inches). It can hold about 45 L (12 gallons). The style of the vase is red-figure pottery, in which figure outlines, details, and the background are painted with an opaque black slip while the figures themselves are left in the color of the unpainted terracotta ceramic clay. \nThe krater is decorated with two scenes. An episode from the Trojan War is shown on the obverse; this illustration depicts the death of Sarpedon, son of Zeus and Laodamia. The reverse of the krater shows a contemporary scene of Athenian youths from the sixth century BC arming themselves before battle. In the scene of Sarpedon's death, the god Hermes directs the personifications of Sleep (Hypnos) and Death (Thanatos) to carry the fallen away to his homeland for burial. While the subject of Sarpedon's death might normally be depicted as a stylized tableau, the figures in this scene are painted in naturalistic poses and with schematic, but accurate anatomy. This style is emblematic of the Pioneer Group of late Archaic painters, of whom Euphronios is considered the most accomplished. The scene of the anonymous Greek youths on the reverse shares this naturalistic style, using all the Pioneer Group's characteristic techniques of anatomical accuracy, natural poses, foreshortening, and spatial illusion.\n\nAlso characteristic of the Pioneer Group is the narrative tension created both by pairing these two scenes on the same piece, and by painting them in a common style. The death of Sarpedon, a quasi-mythological story which would be familiar to anyone viewing the krater, is an episode involving specific historical and mythological figures. The other scene, of the anonymous youths preparing for war, is both more general and explicitly contemporary. The young men are not heroes of legend; with their finely detailed features, they are given personality and character, but they could be any of the youthful soldiers in the Greek army. Both scenes are painted with similar styles, making the historical scene appear more contemporary; likewise, the contemporary scene begins to share some of the other's mythological qualities. The two scenes invite comparison between the narratives they depict; certainly, the hero Sarpedon was no less youthful than these anonymous boys, and Death and Sleep may well come for them as they did for him.\n\nThe vase is signed both by Euxitheos as potter and Euphronios as painter. While it was customary for the painter to sign the finished work, it was less common for the potter to add his own name. The presence of both signatures indicates that Euxitheos felt the vase to be one of his finest works. Besides the artists' signatures on the obverse side, it also carries the inscription \"Leagros is handsome.\" on the reverse. This inscription has allowed art historians to date the krater to approximately 520-510 BC, because at this time Leagros was considered the handsomest man in Greece. All names are written in Attic letters.\n\nRecords in Italian courts of an investigation indicate that the krater was looted from an Etruscan tomb in the Greppe Sant'Angelo near Cerveteri in December 1971. The krater was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Robert E. Hecht, an American antiquities dealer living in Rome, for US$1.2 million on November 10, 1972. Hecht, who was accused of trafficking in illicit antiquities, claimed to have acquired the krater from Dikran Sarrafian, a Lebanese dealer, whose family had been in possession of the piece since 1920. Evidence suggests that Hecht may have purchased the krater in 1972 from Giacomo Medici, an Italian dealer who was convicted of selling stolen art in 2005. Hecht denied the charges.\n\nThomas Hoving, director of the Met and the primary negotiator in the purchase, later said in his memoirs, \"Making the Mummies Dance\", \"An intact red-figured Greek vase of the early sixth century B.C. could only have been found in Etruscan territory in Italy, by illegal excavators\". To allay concerns, some six months after the krater was bought he prompted the Metropolitan Museum to send a private detective to Zurich in an endeavor to reinforce the cited Sarrafian provenance.\n\nIn 2006, following the trial of Giacomo Medici and related disclosures about antiquities smuggling, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Italian government signed an agreement under which ownership of the Euphronios krater and several other pieces of art was returned to Italy in exchange for long-term loans of other comparable objects owned by Italy. The krater remained on display at the Metropolitan Museum until January 2008, when it returned to Italy. It was unveiled in Rome on 18 January. The krater was displayed at the Villa Giulia National Etruscan Museum in Rome from 2008-2014 until it was moved as part of a temporary display in the Cerveteri Museum celebrating the UNESCO World Heritage Site affiliation for the necropolis at Banditaccia. Following the increase of attendance at the museum, the Cultural Heritage Minister, Dario Franceschini, has announced that the krater will remain at the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning works of art to their place of origin.\n\nDetails from the krater's obverse have been used as a book cover illustration. The Penguin Classics deluxe edition of Robert Fagles' English translation of the Iliad employs a close-up of Thanatos for its front cover, and a close-up of Sarpedon for its back cover.\n\n"}
{"id": "9315780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9315780", "title": "Expanded Cinema", "text": "Expanded Cinema\n\nExpanded Cinema by Gene Youngblood (1970), the first book to consider video as an art form, was influential in establishing the field of media arts. In the book he argues that a new, expanded cinema is required for a new consciousness. He describes various types of filmmaking utilizing new technology, including film special effects, computer art, video art, multi-media environments and holography.\n\nIn the first part of the book, Youngblood attempts to show how \"expanded cinema\" will unite art and life. \"Television's elaborate movie-like subjective-camera \"simulation\" of the first moon landing\" (p46) showed a generation that reality was not as real as simulation. He says that he is writing \"at the end of the era of cinema as we've known it, the beginning of an era of image-exchange between man and man\" (p. 49). The \"future shock\" of the \"Paleocybernetic Age\" will change fundamental concepts such as intelligence, morality, creativity and the family (pp. 50–53). The \"Intermedia network\" of the mass media is contemporary man's environment, replacing nature. He uses recent scientific research into cellular memory and inherited memory to support his claim that this network conditions human experience. The \"Noosphere\" (a term Youngblood borrows from Teilhard de Chardin) is the organizing intelligence of the planet—the minds of its inhabitants. \"Distributed around the globe by the intermedia network, it becomes a new \"technology\" that may prove to be one of the most powerful tools in man's history\" (p. 57). He defends the universality of art against the localism of entertainment:\n\nThe intermedia network has made all of us artists by proxy. A decade of television-watching is equal to a comprehensive course in dramatic acting, writing, and filming...the mystique is gone—we could almost do it ourselves. Unfortunately too many of us do just that: hence the glut of sub-mediocre talent in the entertainment industry.\n\nThis is what forces cinema to expand and become more complex. Mass media entertainment dulls people's minds. It is a closed, entropic system, adding nothing new. (pp. 59–65) Entertainment dwells on the past. We live in \"future shock\" so art should be an invention of a future (pp. 66–69). New systems need to be designed for old information. The artist is a \"design scientist\".\n\nYoungblood describes television as the software of the planet. It acts as a superego and shows us global reality. This renders cinema obsolete as a communicator of objective reality, and so frees it (pp. 78–80). He embraces a synaesthetic synthesis of opposites which are simultaneously perceived. He then goes on to draw a distinction between the syncretic montage of Pudovkin and the Eisenstein's montage of collision (pp. 84–86). He prefers metamorphosis to cuts (p86). Filmmakers that Youngblood think embody this synesthetic syncretism include: Stan Brakhage (p. 87), Will Hindle, Pat O'Neill, John Schofill, and Ronald Nameth. Filmmakers that present ideas of polymorphous eroticism, the blurring of sexual boundaries, include Andy Warhol and Carolee Schneemann (pp. 112–121). Michael Snow's \"Wavelength\" is also an example of synaesthetic cinema's extra-objective reality (pp. 122–127). At the end of the second part of the book Youngblood writes about the rebirth of the cottage industry in the post-mass-audience age. Video tapes can be exchanged freely, films are becoming more personal, specializations are ending (pp. 128–134).\n\nYoungblood analyses to explore the \"electronic age existentialism\" (pp. 139–150). He examines Douglas Trumbull's use of mechanical processes to create the \"Stargate sequence\" (pp. 151–156) and describes the work of Jordan Belson as an example of \"cosmic cinema\" (pp. 157–177).\n\nYoungblood defines the \"technosphere\" as a symbiosis between man and machine. The computer liberates man from specialization and amplifies intelligence (pp. 180–182). He draws comparisons between computer processing and human neural processing (pp. 183–184). Logic and intelligence is the brain's software. He predicts that computer software will become more important than hardware and that in the future super-computers will design ever more advanced computers (pp. 185–188). His vision of the future is the \"Aesthetic Machine\": \"Aesthetic application of technology is the only means of achieving new consciousness to match our environment\" (p189). Creativity will be shared between man and machine. He points to the links between computer art and Conceptualism, and the growing theoretical basis of art. In his cybernetic art exploration of \"Cybernetic Cinema\" he gives an account of early experiments using computers to draw and make films. He bemoans the fact that at the time of writing no computer has the power to generate real-time images and that computer art has to be made off-line. He does, though, foresee a future in which location shooting will become obsolete as all locations will be able to be simulated with computers (pp. 194–2006). Examples of filmmakers using computers, referred to by Youngblood, include: John Whitney, James Whitney, Michael Whitney, John Stehura, Stan VanDerBeek and Peter Kamnitzer (pp. 207–256).\n\nYoungblood describes the \"videosphere\", in which computers and televisions are extensions to man's central nervous system. He is optimistic about technological advances and predicts TV-on-demand by 1978 (pp. 260–264). He does acknowledge, however, that data retrieval is more complicated than data recording. The various processes involved in video synthesizing are described: de-beaming, keying, chroma-keying, feedback, mixing, switching and editing (pp. 265–280). The work of Loren Sears is neuroesthetic because it treats television as an extension of the central nervous system (pp. 291–295). The curator James Newman moved from a traditional gallery to a conceptual gallery with his joint project with KQED-TV, commissioning television work from Terry Riley, Yvonne Rainer, Frank Zappa, Andy Warhol, The Living Theater, Robert Frank and Walter De Maria (pp. 292–293). Nam June Paik has worked creatively with television (pp. 302–308). Les Levine exploits the potential of closed-circuit television (pp. 337–344).\n\nYoungblood sees the artist as an ecologist, involved with the environment rather than with objects (pp. 346–351). By way of example he cites the video displays at world expositions (specifically Roman Kroitor's large-scale projections at Expo 67 and Expo '70 (pp. 352–358), and the \"Cerebrum\", an art/nightclub environment. Artists such as Carolee Schneemann and Robert Whitman combine film projection with live performance (pp. 366–371). Wolf Vostell incorporates video experiments into environmental contexts (p. 383). Light shows are used in concerts and multiple projectors and video screens create complex environments.\n\nFinally, Youngblood explores the creative potential of holography.\n\n\n"}

In 1791 he represented the department of Var in the Legislative Assembly, but after the fall of his party, the Girondists, he went into hiding. Discovered and imprisoned in Paris, he wrote his play \"Caton d'Utique\" (1794) during his imprisonment.\n\nIn 1803 he won the Institut de France's poetry prize. \"Éléonore de Bavière\" and \"Les Templiers\" were accepted by the Comédie-Française. \"Les Templiers\" was produced in 1805, and, over the opposition of Geoffroy, was a great success. Elected to the Académie française in 1807, elected to the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1816, Raynouard was admitted \"secrétaire perpétuel\" of the Académie française in 1817. From 1806 to 1814 he represented the department of Var in the Corps législatif.\n\nRaynouard wrote other plays, one of which, \"Les États de Blois\" (acted 1810), offended Napoleon by its freedom of speech. Realizing that the public taste had changed and that Romanticism would triumph, Raynouard abandoned the stage and devoted himself to linguistic studies. His researches into Provençal were to an extent inaccurate, but his enthusiasm and perseverance opened the way for the study of the subject.\n\nRaynouard is sometimes called the founder of Romance linguistics, although his contribution was marked by a fundamental misconception: he believed that the Romance languages were derived from a common post-Latin language, which he called \"le roman\", and not directly from Latin, as is in fact the case. Raynouard's chief works are \"Choix de poésies originales des troubadours\" (6 vols., 1816–1821), of which the sixth volume, \"Grammaire comparée des langues de l'Europe latine, dans leurs rapports avec la langue des troubadours\" (1821), was separately published; \"Lexique roman ou dictionnaire de la langue des troubadours comparée avec les autres langues de l'Europe latine\" (6 vols., 1838–1844). He spent the last years of his life at Passy.\n\nRaynouard was Officer of the Legion of Honour. In the 16th arrondissement of Paris, a street and a square have been named after him. In Brignoles, a monument pays tribute to him near the house he was born in, and the secondary school (\"lycée\") and a boulevard have been named after him.\n\n\n\n\nNotes\nSources<br>\n"}

{"id": "39127332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39127332", "title": "High-altitude adaptation in humans", "text": "High-altitude adaptation in humans\n\nHigh-altitude adaptation in humans is an instance of evolutionary modification in certain human populations, including those of Tibet in Asia, the Andes of the Americas, and Ethiopia in Africa, who have acquired the ability to survive at extremely high altitudes. This adaptation means irreversible, long-term physiological responses to high-altitude environments, associated with heritable behavioural and genetic changes.\n\nWhile the rest of the human population would suffer serious health consequences, the indigenous inhabitants of these regions thrive well in the highest parts of the world. These people have undergone extensive physiological and genetic changes, particularly in the regulatory systems of oxygen respiration and blood circulation, when compared to the general lowland population.\n\nThis special adaptation is now recognised as an example of natural selection in action. The adaptation account of the Tibetans has become the fastest case of human evolution in the scientific record, as it is estimated to have occurred in less than 3,000 years.\n\nModern humans dispersed from Africa less than 100,000 years ago, and eventually colonized the rest of the world, including the harshest environments of extreme cold and high mountains. The abundance of oxygen in the atmosphere is inversely related to altitude from the sea level; hence, the highest mountain ranges of the world are considered unsuitable for human habitation.\n\nNevertheless, around 140 million people, just under 2% of the world's human population, live permanently at high altitudes, that is, at heights above in South America, East Africa, and South Asia. These populations have done so for millennia without apparent complications. The overwhelming majority, over 98% of humans from other parts of the world, normally suffer symptoms of altitude sickness in these regions, often resulting in life-threatening trauma and even death.\n\nStudies on the detail biological mechanism have revealed that adaptation of the Tibetans, Andeans and Ethiopians is indeed an observable instance of the process of natural selection in acting on favourable characters such as enhanced respiratory mechanisms in humans.\n\nHumans are naturally adapted to lowland environment where oxygen is abundant. When people from the general lowlands go to altitudes above , with atmospheric pressure 74% of normal they experience mountain sickness, which is a type of hypoxia, a clinical syndrome of severe lack of oxygen. Complications include fatigue, dizziness, breathlessness, headaches, insomnia, malaise, nausea, vomiting, body pain, loss of appetite, ear-ringing, blistering and purpling of the hands and feet, and dilated veins.\n\nThe sickness is compounded by related symptoms such as cerebral oedema (swelling of brain) and pulmonary oedema (fluid accumulation in lungs). For several days, they breathe excessively and burn extra energy even when the body is relaxed. The heart rate then gradually decreases. Hypoxia, in fact, is one of the principal causes of death among mountaineers. In women, pregnancy can be severely affected, such as development of high blood pressure, called preeclampsia, which causes premature labour, low birth weight of babies, and often complicated with profuse bleeding, seizures, and death of the mother.\n\nMore than 140 million people worldwide are estimated to live at an elevation higher than above sea level, of which 13 million are in Ethiopia, 1.7 million in Tibet (total of 78 million in Asia), 35 million in the South American Andes, and 0.3 million in Colorado Rocky Mountains. Certain natives of Tibet, Ethiopia, and the Andes have been living at these high altitudes for generations and are protected from hypoxia as a consequence of genetic adaptation. It is estimated that at , every lungful of air only has 60% of the oxygen molecules that people at sea level have. At elevations above , lack of oxygen becomes seriously lethal. That is, these highlanders are constantly exposed to an intolerably low oxygen environment, yet they live without any debilitating problems. Basically, the shared adaptation is the ability to maintain relatively low levels of haemoglobin, which is the chemical complex for transporting oxygen in the blood. One of the best documented effects of high altitude is a progressive reduction in birth weight. It has been known that women of long-resident high-altitude population are not affected. These women are known to give birth to heavier-weight infants than women of lowland inhabitants. This is particularly true among Tibetan babies, whose average birth weight is 294-650 (~470) g heavier than the surrounding Chinese population; and their blood-oxygen level is considerably higher.\n\nThe first scientific investigations of high-altitude adaptation was done by A. Roberto Frisancho of the University of Michigan in the late 1960s among the Quechua people of Peru. Paul T. Baker, Penn State University, (in the Department of Anthropology) also conducted a considerable amount of research into human adaptation to high altitudes, and mentored students who continued this research. One of these students went on to conduct research on high altitude adaptation among the Tibetans in the early 1980s through to today, anthropologist Cynthia Beall of the Case Western Reserve University.\n\nScientists started to notice the extraordinary physical performance of Tibetans since the beginning of Himalayan climbing era in the early 20th century. The hypothesis of a possible evolutionary genetic adaptation makes sense. The Tibetan plateau has an average elevation of above sea level, and covering more than 2.5 million km, it is the highest and largest plateau in the world. In 1990, it was estimated that 4,594,188 Tibetans live on the plateau, with 53% living at an altitude over . Fairly large numbers (about 600,000) live at an altitude exceeding in the Chantong-Qingnan area. Where the Tibetan highlanders live, the oxygen level is only about 60% of that at sea level. The Tibetans, who have been living in this region for 3,000 years, do not exhibit the elevated haemoglobin concentrations to cope with oxygen deficiency as observed in other populations who have moved temporarily or permanently at high altitudes. Instead, the Tibetans inhale more air with each breath and breathe more rapidly than either sea-level populations or Andeans. Tibetans have better oxygenation at birth, enlarged lung volumes throughout life, and a higher capacity for exercise. They show a sustained increase in cerebral blood flow, lower haemoglobin concentration, and less susceptibility to chronic mountain sickness than other populations, due to their longer history of high-altitude habitation.\n\nGeneral people can develop short-term tolerance with careful physical preparation and systematic monitoring of movements, but the biological changes are quite temporary and reversible when they return to lowlands. Moreover, unlike lowland people who only experience increased breathing for a few days after entering high altitudes, Tibetans retain this rapid breathing and elevated lung-capacity throughout their lifetime. This enables them to inhale larger amounts of air per unit of time to compensate for low oxygen levels. In addition, they have high levels (mostly double) of nitric oxide in their blood, when compared to lowlanders, and this probably helps their blood vessels dilate for enhanced blood circulation. Further, their haemoglobin level is not significantly different (average 15.6 g/dl in males and 14.2 g/dl in females), from those of people living at low altitude. (Normally, mountaineers experience >2 g/dl increase in Hb level at Mt. Everest base camp in two weeks.) In this way they are able to evade both the effects of hypoxia and mountain sickness throughout life. Even when they climbed the highest summits like Mt. Everest, they showed regular oxygen uptake, greater ventilation, more brisk hypoxic ventilatory responses, larger lung volumes, greater diffusing capacities, constant body weight and a better quality of sleep, compared to people from the lowland.\n\nIn contrast to the Tibetans, the Andean highlanders, who have been living at high-altitudes for no more than 11,000 years, show different pattern of haemoglobin adaptation. Their haemoglobin concentration is higher compared to those of lowlander population, which also happens to lowlanders moving to high altitude. When they spend some weeks in the lowland their haemoglobin drops to average of other people. This shows only temporary and reversible acclimatisation. However, in contrast to lowland people, they do have increased oxygen level in their haemoglobin, that is, more oxygen per blood volume than other people. This confers an ability to carry more oxygen in each red blood cell, making a more effective transport of oxygen in their body, while their breathing is essentially at the same rate. This enables them to overcome hypoxia and normally reproduce without risk of death for the mother or baby. The Andean highlanders are known from the 16th-century missionaries that their reproduction had always been normal, without any effect in the giving birth or the risk for early pregnancy loss, which are common to hypoxic stress. They have developmentally acquired enlarged residual lung volume and its associated increase in alveolar area, which are supplemented with increased tissue thickness and moderate increase in red blood cells. Though the physical growth in body size is delayed, growth in lung volumes is accelerated. An incomplete adaptation such as elevated haemoglobin levels still leaves them at risk for mountain sickness with old age. \n\nAmong the Quechua people of the Altiplano, there is a significant variation in \"NOS3\" (the gene encoding endothelial nitric oxide synthase, eNOS), which is associated with higher levels of nitric oxide in high altitude. Nuñoa children of Quechua ancestry exhibit higher blood-oxygen content (91.3) and lower heart rate (84.8) than their counterpart school children of different ethnicity, who have an average of 89.9 blood-oxygen and 88-91 heart rate. High-altitude born and bred females of Quechua origins have comparatively enlarged lung volume for increased respiration. \n\nBlood profile comparisons show that among the Andeans, Aymaran highlanders are better adapted to highlands than the Quechuas. Among the Bolivian Aymara people, the resting ventilation and hypoxic ventilatory response were quite low (roughly 1.5 times lower), in contrast to those of the Tibetans. The intrapopulation genetic variation was relatively less among the Aymara people. Moreover, unlike the Tibetans, the blood haemoglobin level is quite normal among Aymarans, with an average of 19.2 g/dl for males and 17.8 g/dl for females. Among the different native highlander populations, the underlying physiological responses to adaptation are quite different. For example, among four quantitative features, such as are resting ventilation, hypoxic ventilatory response, oxygen saturation, and haemoglobin concentration, the levels of variations are significantly different between the Tibetans and the Aymaras. The Andeans, in general are the most poorly adapted, as particularly shown by their frequent mountain sickness and loss of adaptative characters when they move to lowlands.\n\nThe peoples of the Ethiopian highlands also live at extremely high altitudes, around to . Highland Ethiopians exhibit elevated haemoglobin levels, like Andeans and lowlander peoples at high altitudes, but do not exhibit the Andean’s increased in oxygen-content of haemoglobin. Among healthy individuals, the average haemoglobin concentrations are 15.9 and 15.0 g/dl for males and females respectively (which is lower than normal, almost similar to the Tibetans), and an average oxygen saturation of haemoglobin is 95.3% (which is higher than average, like the Andeans). Additionally, Ethiopian highlanders do not exhibit any significant change in blood circulation of the brain, which has been observed among the Peruvian highlanders (and attributed to their frequent altitude-related illnesses). Yet, similar to the Andeans and Tibetans, the Ethiopian highlanders are immune to the extreme dangers posed by high-altitude environment, and their pattern of adaptation is definitely unique from that of other highland peoples.\n\nThe underlying molecular evolution of high-altitude adaptation has been explored and understood fairly recently. Depending on the geographical and environmental pressures, high-altitude adaptation involves different genetic patterns, some of which\nhave evolved quite recently. For example, Tibetan adaptations became prevalent in the past 3,000 years, a rapid example of recent human evolution. At the turn of the 21st century, it was reported that the genetic make-up of the respiratory components of the Tibetan and the Ethiopian populations are significantly different.\n\nSubstantial evidence in Tibetan highlanders suggests that variation in haemoglobin and blood-oxygen levels are adaptive as Darwinian fitness. It has been documented that Tibetan women with a high likelihood of possessing one to two alleles for high blood-oxygen content (which is odd for normal women) had more surviving children; the higher the oxygen capacity, the lower the infant mortality. In 2010, for the first time, the genes responsible for the unique adaptive traits were identified following genome sequences of 50 Tibetans and 40 Han Chinese from Beijing. Initially, the strongest signal of natural selection detected was a transcription factor involved in response to hypoxia, called endothelial Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain protein 1 (\"EPAS1\"). It was found that one single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at \"EPAS1\" shows a 78% frequency difference between Tibetan and mainland Chinese samples, representing the fastest genetic change observed in any human gene to date. Hence, Tibetan adaptation to high altitude becomes the fastest process of phenotypically observable evolution in humans, which is estimated to occur in less than 3,000 years ago, when the Tibetans split up from the mainland Chinese population. Mutations in \"EPAS1\", at higher frequency in Tibetans than their Han neighbours, correlate with decreased haemoglobin concentrations among the Tibetans, which is the hallmark of their adaptation to hypoxia. Simultaneously, two genes, egl nine homolog 1 (\"EGLN1\") (which inhibits haemoglobin production under high oxygen concentration) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (\"PPARA\"), were also identified to be positively selected in relation to decreased haemoglobin nature in the Tibetans.\n\nSimilarly, the Sherpas, known for their Himalayan hardiness, exhibit similar patterns in the \"EPAS1\" gene, which further fortifies that the gene is under selection for adaptation to the high-altitude life of Tibetans. A study in 2014 indicates that the mutant \"EPAS1\" gene could have been inherited from archaic hominins, the Denisovans. \"EPAS1\" and \"EGLN1\" are definitely the major genes for unique adaptive traits when compared with those of the Chinese and Japanese. Comparative genome analysis in 2014 revealed that the Tibetans inherited an equal mixture of genomes from the Nepalese-Sherpas and Hans, and they acquired the adaptive genes from the sherpa-lineage. Further, the population split was estimated to occur around 20,000 to 40,000 years ago, a range of which support archaeological, mitochondria DNA and Y chromosome evidence for an initial colonisation of the Tibetan plateau around 30,000 years ago.\n\nThe genes (\"EPAS1\", \"EGLN1\", and \"PPARA\") function in concert with another gene named hypoxia inducible factors (\"HIF\"), which in turn is a principal regulator of red blood cell production (erythropoiesis) in response to oxygen metabolism. The genes are associated not only with decreased haemoglobin levels, but also in regulating energy metabolism. \"EPAS1\" is significantly associated with increased lactate concentration (the product of anaerobic glycolysis), and \"PPARA\" is correlated with decrease in the activity of fatty acid oxidation. \"EGLN1\" codes for an enzyme, prolyl hydroxylase 2 (PHD2), involved in erythropoiesis. Among the Tibetans, mutation in \"EGLN1\" (specifically at position 12, where cytosine is replaced with guanine; and at 380, where G is replaced with C) results in mutant PHD2 (aspartic acid at position 4 becomes glutamine, and cysteine at 127 becomes serine) and this mutation inhibits erythropoiesis. The mutation is estimated to occur about 8,000 years ago. Further, the Tibetans are enriched for genes in the disease class of human reproduction (such as genes from the \"DAZ\", \"BPY2\", \"CDY\", and \"HLA-DQ\" and \"HLA-DR\" gene clusters) and biological process categories of response to DNA damage stimulus and DNA repair (such as \"RAD51\", \"RAD52\", and \"MRE11A\"), which are related to the adaptive traits of high infant birth weight and darker skin tone and are most likely due to recent local adaptation.\n\nThe patterns of genetic adaptation among the Andeans are largely distinct from those of the Tibetan, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. However, \"EGLN1\" appears to be the principal signature of evolution, as it shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans. Even then, the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations. Among the Andeans, there are no significant associations between \"EPAS1\" or \"EGLN1\" SNP genotypes and haemoglobin concentration, which has been the characteristic of the Tibetans. The whole genome sequences of 20 Andeans (half of them having chronic mountain sickness) revealed that two genes, SENP1 (an erythropoiesis regulator) and ANP32D (an oncogene) play vital roles in their weak adaptation to hypoxia.\n\nThe adaptive mechanism of Ethiopian highlanders is quite different. This is probably because their migration to the highland was relatively early; for example, the Amhara have inhabited altitudes above for at least 5,000 years and altitudes around to for more than 70,000 years. Genomic analysis of two ethnic groups, Amhara and Oromo, revealed that gene variations associated with haemoglobin difference among Tibetans or other variants at the same gene location do not influence the adaptation in Ethiopians. Identification of specific genes further reveals that several candidate genes are involved in Ethiopians, including \"CBARA1\", \"VAV3\", \"ARNT2\" and \"THRB\". Two of these genes (\"THRB\" and \"ARNT2\") are known to play a role in the HIF-1 pathway, a pathway implicated in previous work reported in Tibetan and Andean studies. This supports the concept that adaptation to high altitude arose independently among different highlanders as a result of convergent evolution.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6666635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6666635", "title": "Invisible dictatorship", "text": "Invisible dictatorship\n\nAn invisible dictatorship was a term coined by Mikhail Bakunin to describe clandestine revolutionary leadership. Bakunin also used the terms invisible legion and invisible network to describe his concept of invisible dictatorship. \n\nIn nineteenth century Europe the discussion of how a transitional revolutionary government might act took place since the days of Gracchus Babeuf. In 1828 Philippe Buonarroti published \"Conspiration pour l'Egalité dite de Babeuf, suivie du procès auquel elle donna lieu\" which proved to be very influential on Auguste Blanqui and the revolutionaries of 1848, from Louis Blanc to Bakunin. From this arose the concept of a small band of revolutionaries instituting an \"Educational Dictatorship\" which would raise the consciousness of the masses to the point that democracy could be introduced.\n\nIn the French February Revolution of 1848, the provisional government assumed power extralegally, through an announcement before a mass demonstration. Louis Blanc advocated that the provisional government should \"regard themselves as dictators appointed by a revolution which had become inevitable and which was under no obligation to seek the sanction of universal suffrage until after having accomplished all the good which the moment required.\" He also reiterated the idea of the \"dictatorship of Paris\" over the country. Bakunin, having received funds from Blanc's provisional government, threw himself into the revolutionary movement in Bohemia. He subsequently described his aim as the establishment of a \"government with unlimited dictatorial power,\" in which \"all will be subjugated to a single dictatorial authority,\" through three secret societies based on \"strict hierarchy and unconditional discipline.\" Hal Draper claims this was the first appearance of his concept of a \"secret dictatorship\" exercised by \"Invisible Dictators.\" Bakunin also saw Prague playing the role of Paris: \"The revolutionary government with unlimited dictatorial power must sit in Prague ... All clubs and journals, all manifestations of garrulous anarchy, will also be destroyed, and all will be subjugated to a single dictatorial authority.\" Eddie Ford has described this as a '‘dual organisation’' principle, with a secret cadre of controllers manipulating a public front.\n\nIn 1866 Bakunin abandoned the idea of state or centralized authority, and his ideas of what a secret society should be changed accordingly:\n\nThis theme is also to be found in a letter sent by Bakunin to Albert Richard, a fellow member of the Alliance of Social Democracy during the turmoil surrounding the Paris Commune:\n\nAnarchist theorist George Woodcock developed the idea of what he called a \"pure anarchism\", defining it as \"the loose and flexible affinity group which needs no formal organization and carries on anarchist propaganda through an invisible network of personal contacts and intellectual influences.\" However he argued that this was incompatible with mass movements like anarcho-syndicalism as they \"make compromises with day-to-day situations\" and because they have to \"maintain the allegiance of masses of [workers] who are only remotely conscious of the final aim of anarchism.\" However this viewpoint has been rejected by other anarchists such as Sam Dolgoff, who countered \"There is no \"pure\" anarchism. There is only the application of anarchist principles to the realities of social living.\"\n\nBakunin's use of the term 'invisible dictatorship' has been criticised from a number of view points, sometimes in an attempt to discredit anarchism by associating it with this term. Some anarchists have rejected these criticisms with the claim that anarchism is innately incompatible with the concept of coercion, quoting Bakunin himself on this. The concept of the invisible dictatorship is based more on intellectual leadership and carries no connotation of forced leadership.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31348442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31348442", "title": "Language Grid", "text": "Language Grid\n\nThe Language Grid is a multilingual service platform on the Internet mainly for supporting Intercultural collaboration. It enables easy registration and sharing of language resources such as online dictionaries, bilingual corpora, and machine translations.\n\nThe Language Grid is developed to increase the accessibility and usability of language resources. It takes the service-oriented approach by wrapping existing language resources as atomic Web services and enables users to compose new services by combining atomic Web services.\n\nThe architecture of the Language Grid is to increase the usability of language resources, and to decrease the risk to providers in opening their resources. By wrapping resources as services, providers can control their intellectual property rights. It is essential to define stakeholders, their roles and the social protocol among them. Every stakeholder related to service grids, a \"service grid user\", can take one or more roles in the following three categories.\n\n\nThe institutional agreement reflects the intentions of the three roles of service grid users. From service providers’ point of view, protection of intellectual property rights is critical. To satisfy such demands, service usage is classified into the following three categories:\n\n\nEven in for-profit organizations, social responsibility activities are classified as non-profit use. This is because such activities are often conducted with public institutions or non-profit organizations. Conversely, the activities of public institutions or non-profit organizations for commercial profit are classified as for-profit use.\n\nThe Language Grid consists of four service layers: P2P Service Grid Layer, Atomic Service Layer, Composite Service Layer and Application System Layer. The P2P Service Grid Layer is constructed by the Service Grid Server Software. \n\nThe main components are Service Supervisor and Grid Composer. The Service Supervisor controls service invocations according to the access control policies registered by service providers. Before service consumers invoke services on Composite Service Container and Atomic Service Container, it verifies whether the request satisfies the providers' access control policies. On the other hand, the Grid Composer coordinates distributed service grids operated by different grid operators in order to connect regional language services. \n\nThe Service Grid Server Software was developed by Language Grid Project, National Institute of Information and Communications Technology. The development started in 2006. From April 2010, this is an open-sourced software maintained by the open source project. The software is used to build the Language Grid, and also employed by LAPPS Grid funded by NSF.\n\nThe Department of Social Informatics of Kyoto University started single operation of the Language Grid in December 2007 for non-profit purpose and research purpose, which is named as Language Grid Kyoto Operation Center. In January 2011, the second operation center for Language Grid was started by the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center of Thailand, which is called Language Grid Bangkok Operation Center. Later, Language Grid Jakarta Operation Center in Indonesia and Language Grid Xinjiang Operation in China were started in 2012 and 2014 respectively. \n\nThe four operation centers are connected with each other to realized the federated operation of the Language Grid, which enables sharing of language services among multiple Language Grids.\n\nIn May 2017, the operation of Kyoto Language Grid was moved from Kyoto University to NPO Language Grid Association. As of May 2018, 183 groups in 24 countries and regions had joined the Kyoto Language Grid, and 226 services are shared in the Federated Language Grid.\n\nResearches of developing and using the Language Grid cover several areas including artificial intelligence, services computing and human-computer interaction.\n\nSince 2006, research funds of the Language Grid have been provided by National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Strategic Information and Communications R&D Promotion Programme of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications in Japan, and Research Institute of Science and Technology for Society of Japan Science and Technology Agency.\n\nIn November 2015, a research collaboration of federated grid for language services was started among the Language Grid, European Language Resources Association and Linguistic Data Consortium.\n\nBy using the language services in different ways based on the Language Grid, activities have been conducted by different communities. In 2006, Language Grid Association was formed among industry, government, academia, and citizens to advance the technologies and applications of the Language Grid.\n\nWhen foreigners, fall ill in different countries, they may be unable to receive adequate medical attention because of their inability to communicate with Japanese medical doctors. The multilingual medical communication support system was developed by Wakayama University in cooperation with Kyoto Center for Multicultural Society. This NPO dispatched volunteer interpreters to several affiliated hospitals a total of 1700 times per year. The support system helps communication between foreign outpatients and medical staff at hospital reception desks. Using the system, hospital staff can ask outpatients about their symptoms, and provide guidance around each section in a hospital.\n\nNPO Pangaea and universities in Japan and Vietnam worked on an agricultural support project with two major goals: low rice productivity and the environmental burdens caused by the excessive use of agrichemicals. From 2011 to 2014, a four-month experiment was conducted each year in Vinh Long Province, which is located in the Mekong Delta. The goal was to provide timely and appropriate agriculture knowledge in rice harvesting to Vietnamese farmers by Japanese experts. Since Japanese experts cannot physically travel to all rural areas, they were highly motivated to use the Language Grid. However, because of low literacy rate in those areas, the farmers had difficulties in using computers and indeed in reading/writing messages. The youth-mediated communication (YMC) model was invented, where children act as mediators and bridge the gaps in language, knowledge and cultures between experts and farmers.\n\n"}
{"id": "24997830", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24997830", "title": "Legal information retrieval", "text": "Legal information retrieval\n\nLegal information retrieval is the science of information retrieval applied to legal text, including legislation, case law, and scholarly works. Accurate legal information retrieval is important to provide access to the law to laymen and legal professionals. Its importance has increased because of the vast and quickly increasing amount of legal documents available through electronic means. Legal information retrieval is a part of the growing field of legal informatics.\n\nIn a legal setting, it is frequently important to retrieve all information related to a specific query. However, commonly used boolean search methods (exact matches of specified terms) on full text legal documents have been shown to have an average recall rate as low as 20 percent, meaning that only 1 in 5 relevant documents are actually retrieved. In that case, researchers believed that they had retrieved over 75% of relevant documents. This may result in failing to retrieve important or precedential cases. In some jurisdictions this may be especially problematic, as legal professionals are ethically obligated to be reasonably informed as to relevant legal documents.\n\nLegal Information Retrieval attempts to increase the effectiveness of legal searches by increasing the number of relevant documents (providing a high recall rate) and reducing the number of irrelevant documents (a high precision rate). This is a difficult task, as the legal field is prone to jargon, polysemes (words that have different meanings when used in a legal context), and constant change.\n\nTechniques used to achieve these goals generally fall into three categories: boolean retrieval, manual classification of legal text, and natural language processing of legal text.\n\nApplication of standard information retrieval techniques to legal text can be more difficult than application in other subjects. One key problem is that the law rarely has an inherent taxonomy. Instead, the law is generally filled with open-ended terms, which may change over time. This can be especially true in common law countries, where each decided case can subtly change the meaning of a certain word or phrase.\n\nLegal information systems must also be programmed to deal with law-specific words and phrases. Though this is less problematic in the context of words which exist solely in law, legal texts also frequently use polysemes, words may have different meanings when used in a legal or common-speech manner, potentially both within the same document. The legal meanings may be dependent on the area of law in which it is applied. For example, in the context of European Union legislation, the term \"worker\" has four different meanings:\n\n\nIn addition, it also has the common meaning: \nThough the terms may be similar, correct information retrieval must differentiate between the intended use and irrelevant uses in order to return the correct results.\n\nEven if a system overcomes the language problems inherent in law, it must still determine the relevancy of each result. In the context of judicial decisions, this requires determining the precedential value of the case. Case decisions from senior or superior courts may be more relevant than those from lower courts, even where the lower court's decision contains more discussion of the relevant facts. The opposite may be true, however, if the senior court has only a minor discussion of the topic (for example, if it is a secondary consideration in the case). A information retrieval system must also be aware of the authority of the jurisdiction. A case from a binding authority is most likely of more value than one from a non-binding authority.\n\nAdditionally, the intentions of the user may determine which cases they find valuable. For instance, where a legal professional is attempting to argue a specific interpretation of law, he might find a minor court's decision which supports his position more valuable than a senior courts position which does not. He may also value similar positions from different areas of law, different jurisdictions, or dissenting opinions.\n\nOvercoming these problems can be made more difficult because of the large number of cases available. The number of legal cases available via electronic means is constantly increasing (in 2003, US appellate courts handed down approximately 500 new cases per day), meaning that an accurate legal information retrieval system must incorporate methods of both sorting past data and managing new data.\n\nBoolean searches, where a user may specify terms such as use of specific words or judgments by a specific court, are the most common type of search available via legal information retrieval systems. They are widely implemented by services such as Westlaw, LexisNexis, and Findlaw. However, they overcome few of the problems discussed above.\n\nThe recall and precision rates of these searches vary depending on the implementation and searches analyzed. One study found a basic boolean search's recall rate to be roughly 20%, and its precision rate to be roughly 79%. Another study implemented a generic search (that is, not designed for legal uses) and found a recall rate of 56% and a precision rate of 72% among legal professionals. Both numbers increased when searches were run by non-legal professionals, to a 68% recall rate and 77% precision rate. This is likely explained because of the use of complex legal terms by the legal professionals.\n\nIn order to overcome the limits of basic boolean searches, information systems have attempted to classify case laws and statutes into more computer friendly structures. Usually, this results in the creation of an ontology to classify the texts, based on the way a legal professional might think about them. These attempt to link texts on the basis of their type, their value, and/or their topic areas. Most major legal search providers now implement some sort of classification search, such as Westlaw's “Natural Language” or LexisNexis' Headnote searches. Additionally, both of these services allow browsing of their classifications, via Westlaw's West Key Numbers or Lexis' Headnotes. Though these two search algorithms are proprietary and secret, it is known that they employ manual classification of text (though this may be computer-assisted).\n\nThese systems can help overcome the majority of problems inherent in legal information retrieval systems, in that manual classification has the greatest chances of identifying landmark cases and understanding the issues that arise in the text. In one study, ontological searching resulted in a precision rate of 82% and a recall rate of 97% among legal professionals. The legal texts included, however, were carefully controlled to just a few areas of law in a specific jurisdiction.\n\nThe major drawback to this approach is the requirement of using highly skilled legal professionals and large amounts of time to classify texts. As the amount of text available continues to increase, some have stated their belief that manual classification is unsustainable.\n\nIn order to reduce the reliance on legal professionals and the amount of time needed, efforts have been made to create a system to automatically classify legal text and queries. Adequate translation of both would allow accurate information retrieval without the high cost of human classification. These automatic systems generally employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that are adapted to the legal domain, and also require the creation of a legal ontology. Though multiple systems have been postulated, few have reported results. One system, “SMILE,” which attempted to automatically extract classifications from case texts, resulted in an f-measure (which is a calculation of both recall rate and precision) of under 0.3 (compared to perfect f-measure of 1.0). This is probably much lower than an acceptable rate for general usage.\n\nDespite the limited results, many theorists predict that the evolution of such systems will eventually replace manual classification systems.\n\nIn the mid-90s the Room 5 case law retrieval project used citation mining for summaries and ranked its search results based on citation type and count. This slightly pre-dated the Page Rank algorithm at Stanford which was also a citation-based ranking. Ranking of results was based as much on jurisdiction as on number of references.\n\nFree-to-use law-texts and associated official metadata:\n\n\n"}

He was a vocal critic of both the main political parties in Taiwan today, the Kuomintang and the Democratic Progressive Party. Although he favored reunification with the People's Republic of China (PRC), especially under the \"One country, two systems\" policy, Li rejected being labeled \"Pan-Blue\" because of his opposition to the Kuomintang. He was an advocate of Chinese nationalism and was given much media exposure in Taiwan due to his popularity as a writer.\n\nLi was born in Harbin, Manchukuo to Li Dingyi (), a professor of Chinese, and Zhang Kuichen (). His family had ancestry in Wei County (modern-day Weifang), Shandong Province, and Fuyu County, Jilin Province. When Li was two years old, the family moved to Beijing, where Li's father worked in the government's opium suppression bureau. There, Li's father was accused of being a traitor to the Kuomingtang by his superiors. Although his father was cleared of the accusations, Li began feeling enmity towards the party. The entire Li family, except for two children, moved to Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. Li received his bachelor's degree from National Taiwan University's Department of History in 1959.\n\nLi was credited for his contributions to the democratic movement in Taiwan between the 1960s and 1980s. In the 1960s, he was the editor-in-chief of \"Wenxing\" (文星), a magazine that promoted democracy and personal freedom. He was jailed by the Kuomintang government from 1971 to 1976, and again from 1981 to 1982, for helping a pro-Taiwan independence legal scholar, Peng Ming-min, escape to Japan in 1970; even though Li himself had a long history of being an advocate of reunification.\n\nThroughout the 1970s, Li received much international attention for his imprisonment. He was highlighted by Amnesty International as one of the three most important political prisoners in Taiwan in 1974.\n\nAfter his release, Li continued to publish articles in magazines and newspapers, criticizing the Kuomintang government. Ninety-six of his books were banned in Taiwan until 1991. In the 1980s he also sponsored numerous anti-Kuomintang magazines.\n\nHis novel \"Mountaintop Love\" (), about a mother and a daughter who fall in love with the same man, though several years apart, established Li's status as a prominent novelist. His novel \"Martyrs' Shrine: The Story of the Reform Movement of 1898 in China\" (北京法源寺), is about the beginning and the failure of the Hundred Days' Reform. Li also published his autobiography in 2001, revealing more than ten of his romantic affairs. The bulk of his work, however, is non-fiction and consists mainly of essays and historical commentaries.\n\nLi strongly supported the idea of \"One country, two systems\" proposed by Deng Xiaoping. He believed that the unification of China was inevitable and at one point advocated immediate surrender of Taiwan to the PRC. He thought that an immediate reunification was more beneficial for Taiwan. This, combined with his past as a political dissident and his witty writing style, had made him a popular figure among the supporters of Chinese reunification. It also made him an unpopular figure among the supporters of Taiwan independence.\n\nLi participated in the presidential election in 2000 as a candidate for the New Party. Li usually played the role of a political gadfly, and his campaign was largely symbolic. He took the election as an opportunity to \"educate\" the people of Taiwan. Both Li and his party publicly encouraged people to vote for James Soong. During the presidential debates, Li even stated that he was not planning to vote for himself and that people should vote for Soong.\n\nSince the 2000 presidential election, Li had bitterly spoken out against pro-independence Nobel laureate Yuan T. Lee, who publicly supported Chen Shui-bian. He also accused former President Lee Teng-hui of corruption. In October 2004, Li ran in the December 11 legislative election as a non-partisan candidate of the South Taipei constituency, and was subsequently elected to be the last winning place. He took office as an independent legislator on 1 February 2005.\n\nIn February 2005, Li held a press conference, accusing the PFP leader, James Soong of having changed his opposition towards military weapons purchase from the United States under the influence of people of pro-American inclination, people with CIA backgrounds and arms traders who would receive kick-backs. Li threatened Soong that he would reveal the names of the people with CIA backgrounds, who were influencing Soong, to the general public unless Soong reverted to his previous opposition position. PFP legislators dismissed the accusation and responded that Li Ao should reveal his evidence to support his story.\n\nLater that year, in June, Li claimed to the Taiwanese press that he had exclusive information from the CIA concerning the 3-19 shooting incident. He alleged that the real motive of the killer was to assassinate the Vice-President Annette Lu in order to garner sympathy votes for Chen Shui-bian, and that the killer had been condoned by the governing party for ulterior political reasons. After flashing several allegedly CIA-endorsed documents to reporters, he mailed them to Annette Lu, claiming that she needed to know the truth about the assassination attempt to the full extent.\n\nOn 19 September 2005, Li returned to Mainland China for the first time in 56 years. He was invited to give speeches at Peking University, Tsinghua University and Fudan University where he was warmly received, and the trip was claimed to have had significant impact on observers of Cross-Strait relations. His speech at Peking University was particularly noteworthy as Li publicly urged the Chinese Communist Party to protect the freedom of speech as laid down in the constitution of the PRC.

{"id": "1885001", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1885001", "title": "Male privilege", "text": "Male privilege\n\nMale privilege is a concept within sociology for examining social, economic, and political advantages or rights that are available to men solely on the basis of their sex. A man's access to these benefits may vary depending on how closely they match their society's ideal masculine norm.\n\nFeminist scholarship in the area of women's studies during the 1970s produced the earliest academic studies of privilege. These studies began by examining barriers to equity between the sexes. In later decades, researchers began to focus on the intersectionality and overlapping nature of privileges relating to sex, race, social class, sexual orientation, and other forms of social classification.\n\nSpecial privileges and status are granted to males in patriarchal societies. These are societies defined by male supremacy, in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, moral authority, social privilege and control of property. With systemic subordination of women, males gain economic, political, social, educational, and practical advantages that are more or less unavailable to women. The long-standing and unquestioned nature of such patriarchal systems, reinforced over generations, tends to make privilege invisible to holders; it can lead males who benefit from such privilege to ascribe their special status to their owned individual merits and achievements, rather than to unearned advantages.\n\nIn the field of sociology, male privilege is seen as embedded in the structure of social institutions, as when men are often assigned authority over women in the workforce, and benefit from women's traditional caretaking role. Privileges can be classified as either \"positive\" or \"negative\", depending on how they affect the rest of society. Women's studies scholar Peggy McIntosh writes: \n\nPositive advantages include having such things as adequate nutrition, shelter, and health care, whereas negative advantages accompanying male privilege include such things as the expectation that a man will have a better chance than a comparably qualified woman of being hired for a job, as well as being paid more than a woman for the same job.\n\nPrivilege is not shared equally by all males. Those who most closely match the ideal masculine norm benefit the most from privilege. In patriarchal societies this ideal, which is pervasive but unattainable for most men, has been described as being \"white, heterosexual, stoic, wealthy, strong, tough, competitive, and autonomous\". Men's studies scholars refer to this ideal masculine norm as \"hegemonic masculinity\". While essentially all males benefit from privilege to some degree, those who visibly differ from the norm may not benefit fully in certain situations, especially in the company of other men that more closely match it. Men who have experienced bullying and domestic violence in youth, in particular, may not accept that they are beneficiaries of privilege. Such forms of coercive violence are linked to the idea of \"toxic masculinity\", a specific model of manhood that creates hierarchies of dominance in which some are favored and others are harmed.\n\nThe invisibility of male privilege can be seen for instance in discussions of the gender pay gap in the United States; the gap is usually referred to by stating women's earnings as a percentage of men's. However, using women's pay as the baseline highlights the dividend that males receive as greater earnings (32% in 2005). In commerce, male dominance in the ownership and control of financial capital and other forms of wealth has produced disproportionate male influence over the working classes and the hiring and firing of employees. In addition, a disproportionate burden is placed upon women in employment when they are expected to be solely responsible for child care; they may be more likely to be fired or be denied advancement in their profession, thus putting them at an economic disadvantage relative to men.\n\nBiologically \"male\" privilege is only one of the many power structures that may exist within a given society. The term \"male privilege\" does not apply to a solitary occurrence of the use of power, but rather describes one of many systemic power structures that are interdependent and interlinked throughout societies and cultures.\n\nAs discussed by Paula Rothernberg in her novel \"Invisible Privilege: A Memoir About Race, Class, and Gender\", male privilege often takes institutionalized and embedded forms from which men may directly benefit. These instances of male privilege systems may attribute to male over empowerment and can help explain man’s sense of centrality in some of the most powerful institutions.\n\nAn example of male privilege in institutionalized academic settings can be observed by the prevalence of men in how curriculums are formed and history and literature is taught across the United States. Historically, all those who have held the title of President of the United States have been male. American government on the national level, including the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives, is also predominantly male.\n\nThe earliest academic studies of privilege appeared with feminist scholars' work in the area of women's studies during the 1970s. Such scholarship began by examining barriers to equity between the sexes. In later decades, researchers began to focus on the intersectionality and overlapping nature of privileges relating to sex, race, social class, sexual orientation, and other forms of social classification.\n\nPeggy McIntosh, one of the first feminist scholars to examine male privilege, wrote about both male privilege and white privilege, using the metaphor of the \"invisible knapsack\" to describe a set of advantages borne, often unaware and unacknowledged, by members of privileged groups. According to McIntosh, privilege is not a result of a concerted effort to oppress those of the opposite gender; however, the inherent benefits that men gain from the systemic bias put women at an innate disadvantage. The benefits of this unspoken privilege may be described as special provisions, tools, relationships, or various other opportunities. According to McIntosh, this privilege may actually negatively affect men's development as human beings, and few question that the existing structure of advantages may be challenged or changed.\n\nEfforts to examine the role of privilege in students' lives has become a regular feature of university education in North America. By drawing attention to the presence of privilege (including male, white, and other forms) in the lives of students, educators have sought to foster insights that can help students contribute to social justice. Such efforts include McIntosh's \"invisible knapsack\" model of privilege and the \"Male Privilege Checklist\".\n\nSome linguistic conventions have privileged men and the male perspective and suggested that maleness is the societal norm. In English, nouns such as \"man\" or \"mankind\" and forms of address like \"you guys\" are routinely used for women while it is not accepted to refer to men as women. Associating a man with something feminine and calling him girl or sissy is usually considered an insult. Expressions like \"freshmen\" or occupational titles such as \"chairman\" are supposed to apply to both sexes and many prestigious occupations are implicitly associated with men so that people use modifiers such as \"woman doctor\" or \"lady doctor\" to signal deviations from the norm that doctors are usually men. In Western culture, male images and exclusively male language for deities such as referring to God as \"he\" or \"father\" have been argued to have reinforced male privilege. Men's greater resemblance to God has been used to justify men's religious and cultural position.\n\nHistorically, the third-person singular pronoun \"he\" is used as a sex-indefinite, generic form for all people (e.g. \"anyone can do it if he tries\") whereas the use of \"she\" to refer to people in general is not allowed. Masculine generics were first introduced by prescriptive grammarians in the 19th century who argued that \"he\" was the only correct sex-indefinite referent. Prior to that, singular \"they\" and \"he or she\" had been widely used in written and spoken English. In 1850 a special Act of Parliament was passed in the United Kingdom that legally proscribed singular \"they\" and \"he or she\" in favor of \"he\", especially to shorten the language used in Acts of Parliament.\n\nMany men may respond to discussions of male privilege by saying that they do not feel that they have been given any unearned advantages, such as in their struggles to find success in employment, education, or relationships. Advocates for men's rights and father's rights as well as anti-feminist men often accept that men's traditional roles are damaging to men but deny that men as a group have institutional power and privilege, and argue that men are now victims relative to women.\n\nOn the other hand, some self-identified feminist men take active roles in challenging oppressive sexism, arguing that male privilege is deeply linked to the oppression of women. They describe men's oppressive behaviors as cultural traits learned within patriarchal social systems, rather than inborn biological traits. Advocates within the broader men's movement oriented towards profeminism or anti-sexism argue that traditional gender roles harm both men and women. \"Liberal\" profeminism tends to stress the ways men suffer from these traditional roles, while more \"radical\" profeminism tends to emphasize male privilege and sexual inequality. Some men may be also be advocates of women's rights but fail to realize that their privilege as a whole, is a part of the issue at hand.\n\nIn both India and China, male offspring are privileged and favored over female children. Some manifestations of son preference and the devaluation of women are eliminating unwanted daughters through neglect, maltreatment, abandonment, as well as female infanticide and feticide despite laws that prohibit infanticide and sex-selective pregnancy termination. In India some of these practices have contributed to skewed sex ratios in favor of male children at birth and in the first five years. Other examples of privileging male offspring are special \"praying for a son\" ceremonies during pregnancy, more ceremony and festivities following the birth of a boy, listing and introducing sons before daughters, and common felicitations that associate good fortune and well-being with the number of sons.\n\nReasons given for preferring sons to daughters include sons' role in religious family rites, which daughters are not permitted to perform, and the belief that sons are permanent members of the birth family whereas daughters belong to their husband's family after marriage in accordance with patrilocal tradition. Other reasons include patrilineal customs whereby only sons can carry on the family name, the obligation to pay dowry to a daughter's husband or his family, and the expectation that sons will support their birth parents financially while it is regarded as undesirable or shameful to receive financial support from daughters.\n\n"}

The language is being taught in local school programs to encourage the use of the language.\n\nMandan is taught at Fort Berthold Community College along with the Hidatsa and Arikara languages. Linguist Mauricio Mixco of the University of Utah has been involved in fieldwork with remaining speakers since 1993. As of 2007, extensive materials in the Mandan language at the college and at the North Dakota Heritage Center, in Bismarck, North Dakota, remained to be processed, according to linguists.\n\nMandan was initially thought to be closely related to Hidatsa and Crow. However, since Mandan has had language contact with Hidatsa and Crow for many years, the exact relationship between Mandan and other Siouan languages (including Hidatsa and Crow) has been obscured and is currently undetermined. Thus, Mandan is most often considered to be a separate branch of the Siouan family.\n\nMandan has two main dialects: Nuptare and Nuetare. \n\nOnly the Nuptare variety survived into the 20th century, and all speakers were bilingual in Hidatsa. In 1999, there were only six fluent speakers of Mandan still alive. Edwin Benson, the last surviving fluent Mandan speaker, died in 2016.\n\nThe language received much attention from White Americans because of the supposedly lighter skin color of the Mandan people, which they speculated was due to an ultimate European origin. In the 1830s Prince Maximilian of Wied spent more time recording Mandan over all other Siouan languages and prepared a comparison list of Mandan and Welsh words (he thought that the Mandan might be displaced Welsh). The idea of a Mandan/Welsh connection was also supported by George Catlin.\n\nWill and Spinden (p. 188) reports that the medicine men had their own secret language.\n\nMandan has the following consonants:\n\nMandan is a subject–object–verb language.\n\nMandan has a system of allocutive agreement and so different grammatical forms may be used that depend on the gender of the addressee. Questions asked of men must use the suffix \"-oʔsha:\" the suffix \"-oʔną\" is used to ask of women. Likewise, the indicative suffix is \"-oʔsh\" to address men, \"-oʔre\" to address women. The same goes for the imperative: \"-ta\" (male), \"-ną\" (female).\n\nMandan verbs include a set of postural verbs, which encode the shapes of the subject of the verb:\n\nThe English translations are not \"A pot was sitting there,\" \"A big village stood there,\" or \"The river lay there.\" That reflects the fact that the postural categorization is required in such Mandan locative statements.\n\nMandan, like many other North American languages, has elements of sound symbolism in its vocabulary. A sound often denotes smallness/less intensity, denotes medium-ness, denotes largeness/greater intensity:\n\n\nCompare the similar examples in Lakhota.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1477019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1477019", "title": "Mixed government", "text": "Mixed government\n\nMixed government (or a mixed constitution) is a form of government that combines elements of democracy (polity), aristocracy and monarchy, making impossible their respective degenerations which are conceived as anarchy, oligarchy and tyranny. The idea was popularized during classical antiquity in order to describe the stability, the innovation and the success of the republic as a form of government developed under the Roman constitution.\n\nUnlike classical democracy, aristocracy or monarchy, under a mixed government rulers are elected by citizens rather than acquiring their positions by inheritance or sortition (at the Greco-Roman time, sortition was conventionally regarded as the principal characteristic of classical democracy).\n\nThe concept of a mixed government was studied during the Renaissance and the Age of Reason by Niccolò Machiavelli, Giambattista Vico, Immanuel Kant, Thomas Hobbes and others. It was and still is a very important theory among supporters of republicanism. Various schools have described modern polities, such as the European Union and the United States, as possessing mixed constitutions.\n\nPlato in his book \"The Republic\" divided governments into five basic types (four being existing forms and one being Plato's ideal form, which exists \"only in speech\"): \n\nPlato found flaws with all existing forms of government and thus concluded that aristocracy, which emphasizes virtue and wisdom, is the purest form of government. Aristotle largely embraced Plato's ideas and in his \"Politics\" three types (excluding timocracy) are discussed in detail. Aristotle considers constitutional government (a combination of oligarchy and democracy under law) the ideal form of government, but he observes that none of the three are healthy and that states will cycle between the three forms in an abrupt and chaotic process known as the kyklos or anacyclosis. In his \"Politics\", he lists a number of theories of how to create a stable government. One of these options is creating a government that is a mix of all three forms of government.\n\nPolybius argued that most states have a government system that is composed of \"more than one\" of these basic principles, which then was called a mixed government system.\n\nThe ideal of a mixed government was popularized by Polybius, who saw the Roman Republic as a manifestation of Aristotle's theory (Millar, 2002). Monarchy was embodied by the consuls, the aristocracy by the Senate and democracy by the elections and great public gatherings of the assemblies. Each institution complements and also checks the others, presumably guaranteeing stability and prosperity. Polybius was very influential and his ideas were embraced by Cicero (Millar, 2002).\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas argued in his letter \"On Kingship\" that a monarchy, with some limitations set by an aristocracy and democratic elements, was the best and most just form of government. He also emphasized the monarch's duty to uphold the divine and natural law and abide by limitations imposed on the monarch by custom and existing law.\n\nCicero became extremely well regarded during the Renaissance and many of his ideas were embraced. Polybius was also rediscovered and the positive view of mixed governments became a central aspect of Renaissance political science integrated into the developing notion of republicanism. In order to minimise the misuse of political power, John Calvin advocated a mixture of aristocracy and democracy as the best form of government. He praised the advantages of democracy: \"It is an invaluable gift if God allows a people to elect its overlords and magistrates\". To further safeguard the rights and liberties of ordinary men and women, Calvin also favored the distribution of power to several political institutions (separation of powers). Mixed government theories became extremely popular in the Enlightenment and were discussed in detail by Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Giambattista Vico, Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Immanuel Kant. Apart from his contemporaries, only Montesquieu became widely acknowledged as the author of a concept of separation of powers (although he wrote rather on their \"distribution\").\n\nAccording to some scholars, for example, Heinrich August Winkler, the notion also influenced the writers of the United States Constitution who based the idea of checks and balances, in part, upon the ancient theory. The constitution of Britain during the Victorian Era with a Parliament composed of the Sovereign (monarchy), a House of Lords (aristocracy) and House of Commons (democracy) is a prime example of a mixed constitution in the 19th century. This political system had its roots in two closely related developments in seventeenth-century England. First, a series of political upheavals—the Civil War (Puritan Revolution), the exclusion crisis of 1679–1681, and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Second, an intense public debate about the best, most liberal and most stable form of government. Its main participants were John Milton, John Locke, Algernon Sidney and James Harrington. Their thinking became the basis of the radical Whig ideology. It \"described two sorts of threats to political freedom: a general decay of the people which would invite the intrusion of evil and despotic rulers, and the encroachment of executive authority upon the legislature, the attempt that power always made to subdue the liberty protected by mixed government. The American Revolution revealed that this radical Whig understanding of politics had embedded itself deeply in American minds. [...] Radical Whig perceptions of politics attracted widespread support in America because they revived the traditional concerns of a Protestant culture that had always verged on Puritanism. That moral decay threatened free government could not come as a surprise to a people whose fathers had fled England to escape sin\". 18th-century Whigs, or commonwealthmen, such as John Trenchard, Thomas Gordon and Benjamin Hoadly \"praised the mixed constitution of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, and they attributed English liberty to it; and like Locke they postulated a state of nature from which rights arose which the civil polity, created by mutual consent, guaranteed; they argued that a contract formed government and sovereignty resided in the people\". So mixed government is the core of both the British form of modern-era democracy, constitutional monarchy, and the American model: republicanism.\n\nThe \"father\" of the American constitution, James Madison, stated in Federalist Paper No. 40 that the constitutional convention of 1787 created a mixed constitution. Madison referred to Polybius in Federalist Paper No. 63. However, much more important was that \"most\" ideas that the American Revolutionaries put into their political system \"were a part of the great tradition of the eighteenth-century commonwealthmen, the radical Whig ideology\".\n\nOne school of scholarship based mainly in the United States considers mixed government to be the central characteristic of a republic and holds that the United States has rule by the one (the President) (monarchy), the few (the Senate, which was originally supposed to represent the States) (aristocracy) and the many (House of Representatives) (democracy). Another school of thought in the United States says the Supreme Court has taken on the role of \"The Best\" in recent decades, ensuring a continuing separation of authority by offsetting the direct election of senators and preserving the mixing of democracy, aristocracy and monarchy.\n\nAccording to a view, in the European Union context the Commission President represents the rule by the one while the Council represents the aristocratic dimension and the Parliament represents the democratic dimension.\n\n\n"}

It is an integral part to national identity.\n\nIt represents one specific form of cultural memory, which makes an essential contribution to national group cohesion. Historically national communities have drawn upon commemorative ceremonies and monuments, myths and rituals, glorified individuals, objects, and events in their own history to produce a common narrative.\n\nAccording to Lorraine Ryan, national memory is based on the public's reception of national historic narratives and the ability of people to affirm the legitimacy of these narratives.\nNational memory typically consists of a shared interpretation of a nation's past. Such interpretations can vary and sometimes compete. They can get challenged and augmented by a range of interest groups, fighting to have their histories acknowledged, documented and commemorated and reshape national stories. Often national memory is adjusted to offer a politicized vision of the past to make a political position appear consistent with national identity. Furthermore, it profoundly affects how historical facts are perceived and recorded and may circumvent or appropriate facts. A repertoire of discursive strategies functions to emotionalize national narrative and nationalize personal pasts.\n\nNational memory has been used calculatedly by governments for dynastic, political, religious and cultural purposes since as early as the sixteenth century.\n\nMarketing of memory by the culture industry and its instrumentalisation for political purposes can both be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.\n\nLorraine Ryan notes that individual memory both shapes and is shaped by national memory, and that there is a competition between the dominant and individual memories of a nation.\n\nHyung Park states that the nation is continuously revived, re-imagined, reconstituted, through shared memories among its citizens.\n\nNational memories may also conflict with the other nations' collective memory.\n\nReports that are narrated in terms of national memory characterize the past in ways that merge the past, the present and the future into \"a single ongoing tale\".\n\nPierre Nora argues that a \"democratisation of history\" allows for emancipatory versions of the past to surface:\n\nHowever, national history being passed on by the culture industry, such as by historical films, can be seen as serious threats to the objective understanding of a nation's past.\n\nNations' memories can be shared across nations via media such as the Internet.\n\nNational memory can be a force of cohesion as well as division and conflict. It can foster constructive national reforms, international communities and agreements, dialogue as well as deepen problematic courses and rhetoric.\n\nIdentity crisis can occur due to bad memories (such as national crimes) or the absence of a belief in a shared past.\n\nOften new developments, processes, problems and events are made sense of and contextualized by drawing from national memory.\n\nCritical history or historic memory cuts from national memory's tradition centric to national heritage and orients itself towards a specialized study of history in a more sociological manner.\n\nIt has been proposed that the unthinkable ought not to be unmasked but that instead what made it thinkable should be reconstructed and that the difficulty of discussing the non-places or the bad places of national memory make it necessary to include forgetfulness and amnesia in the concept.\n\nNational memory may lead to questioning the nation as it is as well as its identity and imply a societal negotiation of what the country wishes to be as a nation. To understand the links between memory, forgetfulness, identity and the imaginary construction of the nation analysis of the discourse in the places of memory is fundamental as in all writings of national history an image of the nation is being restructured.\n\n"}

It was named Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) before 2003. The pillar existed between 1993 and 2009, when it was absorbed into a consolidated European Union structure and became the area of freedom, security and justice.\n\nThe pillar focused on co-operation in law enforcement and combating racism. It was based more around intergovernmental cooperation than the other pillars meaning there was little input from the European Commission, European Parliament and the Court of Justice. It was responsible for policies including the European Arrest Warrant.\n\nIt was created, on the foundations of the TREVI cooperation, as the Justice and Home Affairs pillar by the Maastricht treaty in order to advance cooperation in criminal and justice fields without member states sacrificing a great deal of sovereignty. Decisions were taken by consensus rather than majority (which was the case in the European Community areas) and the supranational institutions had little input.\n\nThe Treaty of Amsterdam transferred the areas of illegal immigration, visas, asylum, and judicial co-operation in civil matters to the integrated European Community. The term \"Justice and Home Affairs\" later covers these integrated fields as well as the intergovernmental third pillar. The pillar was renamed \"Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters\" to reflect its reduced scope.\n\nBefore the Maastricht Treaty, member states cooperated at the intergovernmental level in various sectors relating to free movement and personal security (\"group of co-ordinators\", CELAD, TREVI) as well as in customs co-operation (GAM) and judicial policy. With Maastricht, Justice and Home Affairs co-operation aimed at reinforcing actions taken by member states while allowing a more coherent approach of these actions, by offering new tools for coordinating actions.\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force in December 2009, abolished the entire pillar system. The PJC areas and those transferred from JHA to the Community were once more grouped together in creating an area of freedom, security and justice.\nThe Maastricht Treaty established that, while reaching the objectives of the Union, and notably the freedom of movement, the member states consider the following as areas of common interest under Justice and Home Affairs:\n\nThere were three EU agencies under the PJC pillar: Eurojust, Europol and European Police College (Cepol).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19109883", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19109883", "title": "Rock art of south Oran (Algeria)", "text": "Rock art of south Oran (Algeria)\n\nThe rock art of south Oran, are prehistoric engravings dating from the Neolithic period, which are found in the south of Oran Province, Algeria, in the Saharan Atlas Mountains, in the regions (from west to east) of Figuig, Ain Sefra, El-Bayadh, Aflou and Tiaret. Comparable engravings have been described, even further east, around Djelfa and in the region of Constantine. Although in the past some archaeologists affirmed that these engravings derived from European Upper Paleolithic art, this theory is today definitively rejected.\n\nLess famous than the rock art at the Tassili n'Ajjer site, the South Oran engravings have however been the subject of study since 1863. The most important works are notably those of A. Pomel (from 1893 to 1898), Stéphane Gsell (from 1901 to 1927), G. B. M. Flamand (from 1892 to 1921), Leo Frobenius and Hugo Obermaier (in 1925), l'Abbé Henri Breuil (from 1931 to 1957), L. Joleaud (from 1918 to 1938), and Raymond Vaufrey (from 1935 to 1955).\n\nIn 1955 and 1964 Henri Lhote had visits of several months to the region which allowed him to complete his former researches, to add hundreds of new descriptions and in 1970 to publish \"Les gravures rupestres du Sud-oranais\" in the series \"Mémoires du Centre de recherches anthropologiques préhistoriques et ethnographiques\" (CRAPE) directed at Algiers by Mouloud Mammeri. A notable part of the work was particularly devoted to the engravings of the El-Bayadh region. For Henri Lhote the South Oran region constitutes one of the \"three great centres of art of the antelope age\" with Tassili (\"Oued Djèrat\") and Fezzan.\n\nIn this work Lhote tells that a hearth found at the \"Station of Méandre\", near to Brézina, had been dated to 3900 years B.C., without this figure being capable of \"being attributed to a definite category of the engravings which ornament the 'walls' of the station.\" The oldest of these engravings, on the other hand, show many affinities with those of Tassili which he proposes the minimum date of around 5000. There is therefore room, according to him, to \"adopt it also for the South-Oranian material until better information may be forthcoming.\"\n\n\nA. Pomel, relying on identifications of animals which were later disputed, is at the root of the position of some authors who think that the engravings belong to the Palaeolithic age.\n\nStéphane Gsell, on the other hand, considered the most ancient engravings showing antelope and elephants to be Neolithic, and he distinguished from them the images of rams, which according to him reflect an Ancient Egyptian ritual, which, like the depictions of \"caballins\" he attributed to the historical period.\n\nThe classification proposed by G. B. M. Flamand based on a study of techniques and patinas distinguished a first group of naturalistic engravings (hartebeest, elephant, rhinoceros, rams, donkeys, horses, antelopes), a second, libyco-berber group (engravings of decadent style, little horses, camels, alphabetic characters) and two late groups (Arab inscriptions and modern graffiti).\n\nFor Hugo Obermaier there exist two sub-groups in the neolithic engravings, the older being of naturalistic style (hartebeest), the more recent of sub-naturalistic style (less elaborated and smaller-scale subjects). The cult of the ram with the sphere was, according to him, native to the populations of North Africa before having been adopted by the Egyptians.\n\nHenri Breuil for his part distinguished three stages. In Stage I, contemporary with the end of the Capsian, he places the large hartebeest with ringed horns, the elephants, and the very style-accomplished as well as large human figures (Ksar El Amar). Stage II, which he attributes to the Lower Neolithic, brings together the large ram of Bou Alem, the hartebeest, rhinoceros, elephants and other animals in less accomplished style. The ram, for him, had not yet been domesticated but only tamed, and its cult is rather the origin than the reflex to the Egyptian belief. Stage III includes the figures in decadent style.\n\nRaymond Vaufrey, studying the industry of flint implements found at the foot of the engraved rocks, takes the naturalistic figures to the \"Neolithic of the Capsian tradition\" deriving from the Neolithic of Egypt, and places them between 4200 and 2000 B.C. The ram, which he considers domesticated, is only a transposition of the Egyptian cult of Ammon and the representations of it cannot be older than 2200 B.C. For Henri Lhote however, there is no any archaeological argument which should cause one to separate the rams, supposed to be later, from the giant hartebeest, elephants or rhinoceros. Being like them of Neolithic age, they cannot derive from the Egyptian ram, and need not on that account be considered as the ancestors of a cult of which the ram of Ammon would constitute a late sequel.\n\nHenri Lhote distinguished seven series in the mural art of the South Oranian.\n1. Large engravings of monumental naturalistic style, or Large-scale Hartebeest style. Beside the great hartebeest, elephants and rhinoceros, Lhote placed the numerous ostriches and antelopes, boars, lions and panthers. The animals are represented absolutely in profile apart from the hartebeest, in relative profile (the two-eyed formula being frequent). Lhote placed in this ensemble the human images which accompany them (of which the hands and feet have almost always six digits). No human figure with animal head having been found, he observed that \"the hartebeest ensembles of the Saharan Atlas differ from those of Tassili-n-Ajjer and of Fezzan where these figures are running. The author also thinks that the domestication of the dog was achieved in this period and that the South Oranian presents the most ancient rock testimonies to it. This first stage also includes the \"mythic animals\". All these engravings are made by a punctuation of little dots or hollows, more or less connected, and then most often by a polishing apparently helped by a wooden utensil with the addition of wet sand. Some engravings show a beginning of polishing in the endoperigraphic area (head), others a complete polishing.\n2. Small engravings in naturalistic style, or small-scale hartebeest stage. The stage would be constituted by the collection of engravings of more reduced size, of which the style has been designated as \"School of Tazina\" after the name of one of the sites. These naturalistic images show the same fauna (hartebeest, elephant and rhinoceros) as those of the preceding group but in very conventionalised forms, the legs and tails of the animals being very thinned out, the lines of the horns and the muzzle prolonged in a 'fantastic' way (Flamand), the lengthening of the body, the hind-quarters and the heads having inspired faulty identifications. The style is however not uniform and on certain murals these characteristic deformations co-exist with more realistic depictions. From a technical standpoint the finish of the engravings is regular, no trace surviving of a preliminary dotting-out, and the patina is similar to that of the preceding stage. The human depictions show the same character but the terminal parts of the limbs, hands and feet are generally rounded-off.\n\nFrom a chronological viewpoint, a single station (Koudiat Abd El Hak) shows an indisputable over-drawing, a little antelope with attenuated legs being overdrawn by a large elephant, although another would appear to be later than it. This fact obliged Lhote \"to ask himself if the small-scale school might be earlier than that of the large engravings, or even if the two schools might have been contemporary.\" This latter hypothesis would have implied the existence \"of two different gatherings of humans living side by side or, at the least, two artistic schools operating in parallel.\"\n\nIn his analysis Lhote shows that beyond the great similarity of the fauna represented and of the presence of the \"orant-ram\" association in both stages, the \"orant-hartebeest\" association was not indicated in the second, whereas the antelopes there are more numerous and the lions rarer. He adds that \"the small-scale style extends towards the south Moroccan as far as the Rio de Oro, although the large-scale style remained confined in the south oran area, with certain migrations towards the north-east.\" The author's opinion therefore leans therefore towards the existence of two groups. Furthermore, the style of the small-scale art, by comparison with the static forms of the large-scale figures, reflects \"rather an art which has already attained conventional formulae\", \"more advanced in the sense of a more evolved creative impulse\" and therefore later. But in this hypothesis one should be able to rediscover traces of this so distinctive style in the later group of the decadent engravings, even though these seem, to the contrary, to derive from the large-scale school. In his conclusions the author considers that the small-scale engravings, often thought of as later decadent reminiscences, would be as old as those of the large hartebeest and elephants. \"Whichever solution may prevail\", concluded Lhote, one should consider that the identity of the fauna in each of the two groups indicates that there could not have been a great lapse of time between them, and that, despite the variation of styles, one can ask oneself if they do not represent two expressions of one and the same art.\"\n3. Engravings of sub-naturalistic style or decadent hartebeest stage. These are characterized by the mediocrity of their style and technique, reduced to a fairly clumsy dotting and an irregular final polishing. Their patina is clearer than for the two preceding stages, an observation confirmed by the fact that they are often found on the same murals. Their dimensions are more reduced than the first group, but larger than those of the second, with which they have nothing in common. The most common theme is of sexually displayed human figures, in a semi-crouching position, seen frontally, often together with numerous lions and ostriches. The fauna, less varied than in the two first groups, still includes the last representations of hartebeest of which the horns are not always ringed, and images of elephants, cattle and panthers. The association of man-ram disappears, which seems \"to mark a rupture on the environment of the foregoing stages and shows an evolution of religious beliefs\", replaced by the man-lion association, hartebeest and elephants no longer holding the place which they had formerly occupied. It is, according to Lhote, \"the end, very degraded, of that remarkable artistic epoch of the south Oranian.\n\n4. Engravings of the sub-naturalist style of the husbandmen or the bovidian stage. The domestic cow with long or short horns sometimes wearing little spheres dominates this stage, the fauna being composed otherwise of elephants, antelope and ostriches, while images of humans are rare. The engravings are in various different styles, the formula schematic and massive, called \"quadrangular\" by H. Breuil, seeming like the most ancient. The main group of these engravings are not found in south Oran but in the valley of the Saoura (Sahara): Lhote supposes \"a different origin to that of the preceding groups\", showing \"secondary infiltrations which have come from the south.\" For the author, \"this bovidian civilization has certainly emerged from a Saharan milieu, but it has only made a very superficial appearance in the south Oran,\" following the tracks from the Hills of Ksour, having perhaps \"another direct contact with the Sahara in the region of Brésina.\"\n\n5. Engravings of schematic carriages, which ought to occupy a comparable chronological position to that of the carriages of the Sahara.\n\n6. Libyco-Berber engravings.\n\n7. Modern Arabo-Berber engravings.\n\nFor F. Cominardi, analysing most recently the superimposition of engravings at \"Koudiat Abd el Hak\", it seems accepted that the naturalistic large-scale stage and the naturalistic small-scale stage (the most ancient level being constituted of very tiny engravings, the most recent by works of slightly superior execution) were contemporary, at least within a single epoch, \"the first not being extinguished before the second began.\" The author leans, \"on account of the arguments of the more evolved schematic style, towards placing the naturalistic large-scale stage in the first place, and to making the naturalistic small-scale stage begin before the disappearance of the former.\" According to F. Cominardi, \"It would be during the lapse of time while they coexisted, that the engravings of the plaque of Koudiat were made. Were these two so differentiated artistic worlds brought into being by different peoples? It is possible. It could be explained that they dwelt rarely together on the same rocks, and that the school of Tazina should be so individualized geographically.\" \"If the small-scale naturalistic stage is, by comparison with the older stage, if not contemporary, at least starting to unfold during that time, one could, provisionally, place it between the 6th and the 4th millennium.\"\n\nHenri Lhote identified among the south Oran engravings 41 images of rams or of sheep-like creatures, which is comparatively few in the sum of the representations, \"especially as this figure includes small scale images and the uncertain ones of the decadent school.\" Their symbolic attributes (spheroids, manes, collars) remain very variable, in contrast to those of the Egyptian ram of Ammon, which was furnished right from the start with the symbols which it would always keep, one could claim, according to the author, that they had not yet been fixed in a definitive fashion and we find ourselves here looking at a cult which was just beginning to take form.\" The difference \"shows, if it were still necessary to show, that the South Oranians had not adopted the cult from Egypt.\n\nIn 13 cases the engraved rams are associated with human figures. Analyzing their possible relations, the author's conclusion is \"that the Ram played a religious role of first importance to the south-Oranians, that its association with man, though he may have been in a praying position, should have been armed with an axe, shows that it certainly had the character of a divinity which one would ask things of and which one might, on suitable occasions, sacrifice.\" This role, he adds, \"is well attested in the two hartebeest stages of large and small scale, but disappears in the age of the decadent style where nothing of it remains except the mere vestige.\"\n\nThe representations of hartebeest, more numerous (73 for the region) and in 13 cases associated with the presence of a human, show despite the absence of the spheroid \"which may have been the object of rites associating it with men,\" that it \"held an eminent place in the beliefs of the ancient populations of the South Oranians. As for the lion, represented with facing head in the old hartebeest stage where it is only a single time associated with a man, but shown in profile in the decadent style where its associations with humans are on the contrary quite frequent, it seems to have replaced hartebeest and rams. One should be able, according to Lhote, \"to interpret this phenomenon as a radical modification in the behaviour of south Oranians, a real change, unless it represents the arrival of new human populations.\"\n\nFor Henri Lhote, \"the south Oran engravings are certainly among the oldest artistic and cultic manifestations of Africa which we know of, and the beliefs of which they are the reflection may perhaps have helped to influence the later populations of the Nile valley and of black Africa where animism was to undergo so great a development.\"\n\nConjectures on the identities of the artists have been many. Lhote tells that some have believed them to belong to the black populations ancestral to the Mandinka and the Hausas. But the Tuareg, the Egyptians and the ancestors of the Berbers have also been invoked. They have also been thought to have been the Cro-Magnons, the husbandmen and farmers of Asiatic origin, the Harratines, the Proto-Libyans and the Bushmen. In the absence of discoveries in the region of neolithic human remains and of an adequate understanding of the ambiguity of the images, \"one should avoid any absolute identification\" or \"definitive option\".\n\n\n"}

It drains into Yamuna at Delhi, where its channeled course is also called the Najafgarh drain, which also serves as Najafgarh drain bird sanctuary. Sahibi is a seasonal river which is 120 km long and flows from Aravalli hills in Rajasthan to Haryana, of which 100 km is in Haryana.\n\nSeveral Ochre Coloured Pottery culture sites (also identified as late Harappan phase of Indus Valley Civilisation culture) have been found along the banks of Sahibi river and its tributaries such as Krishnavati river, Dohan river (originates near Neem Ka Thana in Alwar district) and Sota River (merges with Sahibi river at Behror in Alwar district). The drainage pattern for all these rivers is dendritic.\n\nThe Sahibi River originates from the eastern slopes of the Saiwar Protected Forest hills in Aravalli Range near Jitgarh and Manoharpur in Sikar district of Rajasthan state. After covering about 157 km distance in the Rajasthan state. After gathering volume from a hundred tributaries, the Sahibi River forms a broad stream around Alwar and Kotputli.\n\nThese west to north-west flowing rivers originate from the western slopes of Aravalli range in Rajasthan, flow through semi-arid historical Shekhawati region, drain into southern Haryana.\n\nThe catchment area of the Sahibi River encompasses the following cities and towns: Sikar, Jaipur, and Alwar in northeastern Rajasthan state; Bawal, Rewari, Pataudi, and Jhajjar district in southern Haryana state; and Delhi state.\n\nThe catchment area of the Sahibi River in Rajasthan is of Jaipur, Alwar and Sikar Districts, between latitudes 27°16' and 28°11' and longitudes 75°42' and 76°57'. Sahibi Basin falls in three Districts of Rajasthan namely: Alwar district (62.11%), Jaipur district (29.30%) and Sikar district (8.59%).\n\nMean Annual Rainfall in Sahibi Basin is 627.60 mm. Highest maximum temperature ranges from 45.45-45.99 °C with a mean value of 45.8 °C, while Lowest minimum temperature ranges from 1.64-3.14 °C with a mean value of 2.45 °C.\n\nIt leaves Rajasthan state beyond Kotkasim in Alwar district near village Ujauli and covers a total distance of about 222 km up to Dhasa Bund.\n\nIt enters Haryana state at Jhabua, near the city of Rewari in Rewari district, after which it re-enters first Rajasthan state near Kotkasim, and then Haryana again near the village of Jarthal. The dry riverbed near Jarthal is wide. During light monsoon rainfall, the river's flat and sandy bottom absorbs all rainwater. Masani barrage on the river lies near Dahuhera. During heavy rains, the river has defined course up to Pataudi railway station and branches off into two smaller streams to Jhajjar, finally reaching the outskirts of Delhi through Najafgarh drain and ending at the Yamuna River.\n\nThe Najafgarh Drain or Najafgarh Nallah (\"nullah\" in Hindi means \"drain\") is another name for the Sahibi River, which continues its flow through Delhi where it is channelised for flood control purposes. It is a tributary to the Yamuna River, into which it flows. The Najafgarh Drain gets its name from the once famous and huge Najafgarh Lake near the town of Najafgarh in southwest Delhi. The Najafgarh Drain is the capital’s most polluted body of water due to the direct inflow of untreated sewage from surrounding populated areas. Assessing the water quality of wetlands in wildlife habitats, a January 2005 report by the Central Pollution Control Board rated the Najafgarh Drain under category D, along with 13 other highly polluted wetlands.\n\nRegulators at the Keshopur Bus Depot on the Outer Ring Road are wide with thick and high embankments. A vast amount of water is retained in this widened drain by closing the Kakrola regulators under Najafgarh Road to recharge the local groundwater table.\n\nSeveral bridges cross the Sahibi River. A bridge on State Highway 14 crosses the river between Behror and Sodawas (Behror to Alwar Road). On State Highway 52, a bridge crosses the river between Ajaraka and Dadhiya. The Masani barrage is also used as the bridge on NH 919 which merges with NH 48 (Delhi-Jaipur-Mumbai, formerly NH 8) at this barrage near Dharuhera, Rewari. Railway bridges between Ajaraka and Bawal and near Pataudi also cross the river. A railway bridge near Nangal Pathani also crosses the river.\n\nPrior to 1960, the rain-fed Sahibi River entered Delhi near Dhansa and spilled its overflow in the Najafgarh Lake (Jheel) basin, creating a seasonal lake. A vast area more than was submerged in some seasons. In the following decades, the Sahibi River flow reaching Dhansa was channelised by digging a wide drain and connecting it directly to the Yamuna River, completely draining the seasonal Najafgarh Jheel.\n\nThe Sahibi River flooded in 1977. In response, the Masani barrage was constructed on Delhi-Jaipur highway near Masani village, Rewari. Several smaller dams have also been constructed throughout the hills of Rajasthan to store rainwater. The construction of dams has restricted the flow of water on the Sahibi River and it is now rare for water overflow from monsoon rains to reach up the Masani Barrage.\n\nParts of Rajasthan and Haryana that Sahibi river flows through are arid and have only seasonal moonsoon rainfall, in the past river might have held perennial flow as evident by the presence of several Indus Valley Civilization sites on the banks of present-day Sahibi River meanders and its tributaries. Several sites have been found in many locations to establish a pattern of settlement of widespread Indus Valley Civilization along the banks of Sahibi and its tributaries. Archaeological excavation have proven that Indus Valley Civilization people lived here before the Harappan and pre-Mahabharata periods.\n\nAmong the finds are handmade and wheel-made pottery dated to 3309–2709 BCE and 2879–2384 BCE found on the banks of the Sahibi River at Jodhpura.\n\nOther findings include pottery found on the Sahibi riverbed at Hansaka in the Rewari district by INTACH-Rewari.\n\nA red stone statue of Vamana Dev, now displayed at the Shri Krishna Museum, Kurukshetra was unearthed in 2002 on the Sahibi riverbed near Bawal.\n\nIn various other places on Sahibi riverbed, many artifacts have been found, including arrowheads, fishhooks, spearheads, awls, and chisels.\n\nSeveral modern scholars identify the old Ghaggar-Hakra River (of which Tangri river is a tributary) as the Sarasvati river and the Sahibi River with the Drishadvati river of Vedic period, on the banks of which in the Vedic state of Brahmavarta, Indus-Sarasvati civilisation or Vedic Sanskriti developed. Such scholars include Bhargava The Drishadwati River had formed one border of the Vedic state of Brahmavarta while other was Saraswati river. This is mentioned in the \"Rigveda\", the \"Manusmriti\", and the \"Brahmin Granths\" texts also.\n\nThis is an important part of ecological corridor along the route of Sahibi river which traverses from Aravalli hills in Rajasthan to Yamuna via Masani barrage, Matanhail forest, Chhuchhakwas-Godhari, Khaparwas Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhindawas Wildlife Sanctuary, Outfall Drain Number 8 and 6, Sarbashirpur, Sultanpur National Park, Basai and The Lost Lake (Gurugram). It lies 5km northwest of Bhindawas Bird Sancturay and 46 km northwest of Sultantpur National Park via road. \n\nEntire 100 km stretch of Sahibi river and its streams (Sota river, Kotkasim drain and Indori river) in Haryana are ecologically dead. Gurugram also dumps polluted discharge in the riverbed of Sahibi. In some of its reaches, from Mandawar and Kotkasim to Haryana border, meandering of the river causes bank erosion.\n\nGovernment of Haryana is coordinating with Government of Rajasthan to ensure water reaches usually-dry Masani barrage and dying seasonal Sahibi river. Another govt. project is being implemented to direct the extra water of Yamuna river during monsoon to Masani barrage through Jawahar Lal Nehru Canal and Western Yamuna Canal (c. July 2015).\n\n"}

It had been commissioned in 1494 by the Venetian merchant Giorgio Diletti. It is however signed and dated 1513, but it is not known why there were some twenty years between the commissioning and the execution.\n\nThe layout is that of the Holy Conversation typical of the Venetian tradition, largely owed to works by Bellini himself, with an arch opening to a landscape in the background, and three figures of saints. Instead of the usual throne with the Virgin, there is St. Jerome, portrayed as a hermit, on a rock, while reading the Bible. Below, separated by a parapet where is the cartouche with the signature, are St. Christopher and a Saint bishop.\n\nThe latter had been originally identified as St. Augustine based on text on the book (\"De civitate Dei\"), which was later revealed to be apocryphal, as it is not placed on the front cover. Basing on the presence of lilies on the cloak, those of the House of Anjou, the character has been recognized as St. Louis of Toulouse.\n\nThe saints were perhaps chosen depending from Neoplatonic themes, with St. Louis symbolizing the contemplative and liturgic life, and St. Christopher symbolizing preaching. According to this view, Jerome would thus be the highest point of spiritual life. The arch above him is a symbol of the Catholic church, and has a Greek inscription of the Psalm 14, referring to St. Jerome as the sage mentioned in it. The use of Greek derives from San Cristomo's role as church of the Greek-speaking Venetians.\n"}
