(nowadays the VRT), between 1956 and 1959 on Sunday evenings. It was one of the most popular TV shows from the Flemish pioneer years.\n\n\"100.000 of niets\" was originally part of another quiz, \"Knal, wie vangt de bal?\" (\"Bang, who catches the ball?\"). It aired on December 11, 1956 and by January 12, 1958 it became an independent weekly show. The show was hosted by Tony Corsari, Bob Van Bael and Pros Verbruggen and the jury was hosted by Mr. Van Hove, professor Lucien De Smet and Dr. A.J. Aernouts. In 1959 the show was cancelled. In 1968 it returned to the screen, presented by Pros Verbruggen, Jan Theys and Rudy Samson. Regine Clauwaert was the female guest host.\n\nEach show had three candidates and four thematical rounds. One candidate remained in the finale and had to answer one very detailed question correctly. The prize was 100.000 Belgian francs, though most of the time the winner just received a kitchen device.\n\nWhile the show was popular quite some candidates criticized the correct answers needed. On March 9, 1958, one candidate named Van Cuyck lost after giving only one wrong answer in a series of seven correct ones. According to present-day norms many questions were phrased in an ambiguous manner and since every round the acceptance of dubious answers tended to differ at times. One time a candidate complained that his answer was indeed correct, despite being told it wasn't. Host Tony Corsari personally made sure that the man received his award after all.\n\nFemale host Liliane Taelemans received a lot of criticism because her clothes were considered to be \"too revealing\". She was eventually fired and in 1958 she went on to become the Belgian candidate for the Miss Universe election.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1853066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1853066", "title": "Arabesque (Turkish music)", "text": "Arabesque (Turkish music)\n\nArabesque or Arabesk () is a term created by Turkish musicologists for an Arabic style of music created in Turkey. The genre was particularly popular in Turkey in the decades from the 1960s through the 1990s. As with Arabic music itself, its aesthetics have evolved over the decades. Although melodies and rhythms are predominantly Byzantine and Arabic influenced, it also draws ideas from other aspects of Balkan and Middle Eastern music, including bağlama music and Ottoman forms of oriental music.\nArabesque music are mostly in a minor key, typically in the Phrygian mode, and themes tend to focus on longing, melancholy, strife and love issues.\n\nA very small percentage of Arabesk is exclusively instrumental. For the great majority of it, a singer lies at the center of the music. Male singers dominated the genre in its early years, but female singers probably predominated during its peak years of popularity. Simultaneously with the influx of female singers, the sound grew more dancey and upbeat.\nOrhan Gencebay is generally considered the founder of the genre (though he disagrees with the usage of the term). Other well known older singers are Müslüm Gürses, Ferdi Tayfur and Hakkı Bulut. One of the most prolific and commercially successful is İbrahim Tatlıses, who broke all sales records in Turkey in 1978 and continues to turn out popular music to this day. He has maintained popularity in the Arabesk scene in recent years through remixing his tracks into dance-friendly club tracks. The pure Arabesk album \"Acıların Kadını\" (tr: woman of pains) by the singer Bergen was the bestselling album in Turkey in 1986 and may be fairly labelled one of the classic albums of the genre. Bergen had several other hit Arabesk albums during the 1980s. Other singers include Gülben Ergen, Ebru Gündeş, Seda Sayan, Sibel Can. The singers Muazzez Ersoy and Bülent Ersoy designate themselves as modern exponents of Ottoman classical music. Zerrin Özer also made arabesque albums between 1982 and 1988, including her album named \"Mutluluklar Dilerim\" released in 1984. One of the important names of arabesque music who died in 2012 was Azer Bülbül.\nA common theme in Arabesque songs is the highly embellished and agonizing depiction of love and yearning, along with unrequited love, grief and pain. This theme had undertones of class differences in early 1960-70s, during which most of the genre's followers -mostly working class to lower middle class - identified themselves with. Turkish composer Fazıl Say has repeatedly condemned and criticized Arabesque genre, equating the practice of listening to Arabesque \"tantamount to treason\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "185034", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185034", "title": "Bernard Lewis", "text": "Bernard Lewis\n\nBernard Lewis, FBA (31 May 1916 – 19 May 2018) was a British American historian specializing in oriental studies. He was also known as a public intellectual and political commentator. Lewis was the Cleveland E. Dodge Professor Emeritus of Near Eastern Studies at Princeton University. Lewis' expertise was in the history of Islam and the interaction between Islam and the West. He was also noted in academic circles for his works on the history of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nLewis served as a soldier in the British Army in the Royal Armoured Corps and Intelligence Corps during the Second World War before being seconded to the Foreign Office. After the war, he returned to the School of Oriental and African Studies at the University of London and was appointed to the new chair in Near and Middle Eastern History.\n\nIn 2007 and 1999, respectively, Lewis was called \"the West's leading interpreter of the Middle East\" and \"the most influential postwar historian of Islam and the Middle East\". His advice was frequently sought by neoconservative policymakers, including the Bush administration. However, his support of the Iraq War and neoconservative ideals have since come under scrutiny.\n\nLewis was also notable for his public debates with Edward Said, who accused Lewis and other orientalists of misrepresenting Islam and serving the purposes of imperialist domination, to which Lewis responded by defending Orientalism as a facet of humanism and accusing Said of politicizing the subject. Lewis argued that the deaths of the Armenian Genocide resulted from a struggle between two nationalistic movements and that there is no proof of intent by the Ottoman government to exterminate the Armenian nation. These views prompted a number of scholars to accuse Lewis of genocide denial and resulted in a successful civil lawsuit against him in a French court.\n\nBernard Lewis was born to middle-class Jewish parents, Harry Lewis and the former Jane Levy, in Stoke Newington, London. He became interested in languages and history while preparing for his bar mitzvah.\n\nLewis became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1982. In 1947 he married Ruth Hélène Oppenhejm, with whom he had a daughter and a son. Their marriage was dissolved in 1974.\n\nIn 1936, Lewis graduated from the School of Oriental Studies (now School of Oriental and African Studies, SOAS) at the University of London with a BA in history with special reference to the Near and Middle East. He earned his PhD three years later, also from SOAS, specializing in the history of Islam. Lewis also studied law, going part of the way toward becoming a solicitor, but returned to study Middle Eastern history. He undertook post-graduate studies at the University of Paris, where he studied with the orientalist Louis Massignon and earned the \"Diplôme des Études Sémitiques\" in 1937. He returned to SOAS in 1938 as an assistant lecturer in Islamic History.\n\nDuring the Second World War, Lewis served in the British Army in the Royal Armoured Corps and as a Corporal in the Intelligence Corps in 1940–41 before being seconded to the Foreign Office. After the war, he returned to SOAS. In 1949, at the age of 33, he was appointed to the new chair in Near and Middle Eastern History.\n\nIn 1974, aged 57, Lewis accepted a joint position at Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study, also located in Princeton, New Jersey. The terms of his appointment were such that Lewis taught only one semester per year, and being free from administrative responsibilities, he could devote more time to research than previously. Consequently, Lewis's arrival at Princeton marked the beginning of the most prolific period in his research career during which he published numerous books and articles based on previously accumulated materials. After retiring from Princeton in 1986, Lewis served at Cornell University until 1990.\nIn 1966, Lewis was a founding member of the learned society, Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), but in 2007 he broke away and founded Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa (ASMEA) to challenge MESA, which the \"New York Sun\" noted as \"dominated by academics who have been critical of Israel and of America's role in the Middle East\". The organization was formed as an academic society dedicated to promoting high standards of research and teaching in Middle Eastern and African studies and other related fields, with Lewis as Chairman of its academic council.\n\nIn 1990, the National Endowment for the Humanities selected Lewis for the Jefferson Lecture, the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the humanities. His lecture, entitled \"Western Civilization: A View from the East\", was revised and reprinted in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" under the title \"The Roots of Muslim Rage.\" His 2007 Irving Kristol Lecture, given to the American Enterprise Institute, was published as \"Europe and Islam\".\n\nLewis' influence extends beyond academia to the general public. He was a pioneer of the social and economic history of the Middle East and is famous for his extensive research of the Ottoman archives. He began his research career with the study of medieval Arab, especially Syrian, history. His first article, dedicated to professional guilds of medieval Islam, had been widely regarded as the most authoritative work on the subject for about thirty years. However, after the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, scholars of Jewish origin found it more and more difficult to conduct archival and field research in Arab countries, where they were suspected of espionage. Therefore, Lewis switched to the study of the Ottoman Empire, while continuing to research Arab history through the Ottoman archives which had only recently been opened to Western researchers. A series of articles that Lewis published over the next several years revolutionized the history of the Middle East by giving a broad picture of Islamic society, including its government, economy, and demographics.\n\nLewis argued that the Middle East is currently backward and its decline was a largely self-inflicted condition resulting from both culture and religion, as opposed to the post-colonialist view which posits the problems of the region as economic and political maldevelopment mainly due to the 19th-century European colonization. In his 1982 work \"Muslim Discovery of Europe,\" Lewis argues that Muslim societies could not keep pace with the West and that \"Crusader successes were due in no small part to Muslim weakness.\" Further, he suggested that as early as the 11th century Islamic societies were decaying, primarily the byproduct of internal problems like \"cultural arrogance,\" which was a barrier to creative borrowing, rather than external pressures like the Crusades.\n\nIn the wake of Soviet and Arab attempts to delegitimize Israel as a racist country, Lewis wrote a study of anti-Semitism, \"Semites and Anti-Semites\" (1986). In other works he argued Arab rage against Israel was disproportionate to other tragedies or injustices in the Muslim world, such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and control of Muslim-majority land in Central Asia, the bloody and destructive fighting during the Hama uprising in Syria (1982), the Algerian Civil War (1992–1998), and the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988).\n\nIn addition to his scholarly works, Lewis wrote several influential books accessible to the general public: \"The Arabs in History\" (1950), \"The Middle East and the West\" (1964), and \"The Middle East\" (1995). In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the interest in Lewis's work surged, especially his 1990 essay \"The Roots of Muslim Rage\". Three of his books were published after 9/11: \"What Went Wrong?\" (written before the attacks), which explored the reasons of the Muslim world's apprehension of (and sometimes outright hostility to) modernization; \"The Crisis of Islam\"; and \"Islam: The Religion and the People\".\n\nThe first two editions of Lewis' \"The Emergence of Modern Turkey\" (1961 and 1968) describe the Armenian Genocide as \"the terrible holocaust of 1915, when a million and a half Armenians perished\". In later editions, this text is altered to \"the terrible slaughter of 1915, when, according to estimates, more than a million Armenians perished, as well as an unknown number of Turks\". In this passage, Lewis argues that the deaths were the result of a struggle for the same land between two competing nationalist movements.\n\nThe change in Lewis' textual description of the Armenian Genocide and his signing of the petition against the Congressional resolution was controversial among some Armenian historians as well as journalists, who suggested that Lewis was engaging in historical revisionism to serve his own political and personal interests.\n\nLewis called the label \"genocide\" the \"Armenian version of this history\" in a November 1993 interview with \"Le Monde\", for which he faced a civil proceeding in a French court. In a subsequent exchange on the pages of \"Le Monde\", Lewis wrote that while \"terrible atrocities\" did occur, \"there exists no serious proof of a decision and of a plan of the Ottoman government aiming to exterminate the Armenian nation\". In reference to both these articles, the court stated that Lewis \"failed in his duty of objectivity and prudence in expressing himself without nuance on such a sensitive subject\". He was ordered to pay one franc as damages for his statements on the Armenian Genocide in Ottoman Turkey. Three other court cases against Bernard Lewis failed in the Paris tribunal, including one filed by the Armenian National Committee of France and two filed by Jacques Trémollet de Villers.\n\nLewis' views on the Armenian Genocide were criticized by a number of historians and sociologists, among them Alain Finkielkraut, Yves Ternon, Richard G. Hovannisian, Robert Melson, and Pierre Vidal-Naquet.\n\nLewis has argued for his denial stance that:\n\nLewis stated that he believed \"to make [the Armenian Genocide] a parallel with the Holocaust in Germany\" was \"rather absurd\". In an interview with \"Ha'aretz\", he stated: \n\nLewis has been labelled a \"genocide denier\" by Stephen Zunes, Israel Charny, David B. MacDonald and the Armenian National Committee of America. Yair Auron suggested that \"Lewis' stature provided a lofty cover for the Turkish national agenda of obfuscating academic research on the Armenian Genocide\". Israel Charny wrote that Lewis' \"seemingly scholarly concern ... of Armenians constituting a threat to the Turks as a rebellious force who together with the Russians threatened the Ottoman Empire, and the insistence that only a policy of deportations was executed, barely conceal the fact that the organized deportations constituted systematic mass murder\". Charny compares the \"logical structures\" employed by Lewis in his denial of the genocide to those employed by Ernst Nolte in his Holocaust negationism.\n\nWhen Lewis received the National Humanities Medal from US President George W. Bush in November 2006, the Armenian National Committee of America objected: \"The President's decision to honor the work of a known genocide denier—an academic mercenary whose politically motivated efforts to cover up the truth run counter to the very principles this award was established to honor—represents a true betrayal of the public trust.\"\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Lewis emerged as a commentator on the issues of the modern Middle East and his analysis of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the rise of militant Islam brought him publicity and aroused significant controversy. American historian Joel Beinin has called him \"perhaps the most articulate and learned Zionist advocate in the North American Middle East academic community\". Lewis's policy advice has particular weight thanks to this scholarly authority. U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney remarked \"in this new century, his wisdom is sought daily by policymakers, diplomats, fellow academics, and the news media\".\n\nA harsh critic of the Soviet Union, Lewis continued the liberal tradition in Islamic historical studies. Although his early Marxist views had a bearing on his first book \"The Origins of Ismailism\", Lewis subsequently discarded Marxism. His later works are a reaction against the left-wing current of Third-worldism which came to be a significant current in Middle Eastern studies.\n\nDuring his career Lewis developed ties with governments around the world: during her time as Prime Minister of Israel, Golda Meir assigned Lewis' articles as reading to her cabinet members, and during the Presidency of George W. Bush, he advised administration members including Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Bush himself. He was also close to King Hussein of Jordan and his brother, Prince Hassan bin Talal. He also had ties to the regime of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, the Turkish military dictatorship led by Kenan Evren, and the Egyptian government of Anwar Sadat: he acted as a go-between between the Sadat administration and Israel in 1971 when he relayed a message to the Israeli government regarding the possibility of a peace agreement at the request of Sadat's spokesman Tahasin Bashir.\nLewis advocated closer Western ties with Israel and Turkey, which he saw as especially important in light of the extension of the Soviet influence in the Middle East. Modern Turkey holds a special place in Lewis's view of the region due to the country's efforts to become a part of the West. He was an Honorary Fellow of the Institute of Turkish Studies, an honor which is given \"on the basis of generally recognized scholarly distinction and ... long and devoted service to the field of Turkish Studies.\"\n\nLewis views Christendom and Islam as civilizations that have been in perpetual collision since the advent of Islam in the 7th century. In his essay \"The Roots of Muslim Rage\" (1990), he argued that the struggle between the West and Islam was gathering strength. According to one source, this essay (and Lewis' 1990 Jefferson Lecture on which the article was based) first introduced the term \"Islamic fundamentalism\" to North America. This essay has been credited with coining the phrase \"clash of civilizations\", which received prominence in the eponymous book by Samuel Huntington. However, another source indicates that Lewis first used the phrase \"clash of civilizations\" at a 1957 meeting in Washington where it was recorded in the transcript.\n\nIn 1998, Lewis read in a London-based newspaper \"Al-Quds Al-Arabi\" a declaration of war on the United States by Osama bin Laden. In his essay \"A License to Kill\", Lewis indicated he considered bin Laden's language as the \"ideology of jihad\" and warned that bin Laden would be a danger to the West. The essay was published after the Clinton administration and the US intelligence community had begun its hunt for bin Laden in Sudan and then in Afghanistan.\n\nLewis presented some of his conclusions about Islamic culture, Shari'a law, jihad, and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text \"Islam: The Religion and the People\". He writes of jihad as a distinct \"religious obligation\", but suggests that \"it is a pity\" that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:\n\nIn Lewis' view, the \"by now widespread terrorism practice of suicide bombing is a development of the 20th century\" with \"no antecedents in Islamic history, and no justification in terms of Islamic theology, law, or tradition\". He further comments that \"the fanatical warrior offering his victims the choice of the Koran or the sword is not only untrue, it is impossible\" and that \"generally speaking, Muslim tolerance of unbelievers was far better than anything available in Christendom, until the rise of secularism in the 17th century\".\n\nThis view has been criticised by As'ad AbuKhalil, who noted that: \"Methodologically, [Lewis] insists that terrorism by individual Muslims should be considered Islamic terrorism, while terrorism by individual Jews or Christians is never considered Jewish or Christian terrorism.\" He also criticised Lewis' understanding of Osama bin Laden, seeing Lewis' interpretation of bin Laden \"as some kind of influential Muslim theologian\" along the lines of classical theologians like Al-Ghazali, rather than \"the terrorist fanatic that he is\". AbuKhalil has also criticised the place of Islam in Lewis' worldview more generally, arguing that the most prominent feature of his work was its \"theologocentrism\" (borrowing a term from Maxime Rodinson) - that Lewis interprets all aspects of behaviour among Muslims solely through the lens of Islamic theology, subsuming the study of Muslim peoples, their languages, the geographical areas where Muslims predominate, Islamic governments, the governments of Arab countries and Sharia under the label of \"Islam\".\n\nLewis was known for his literary debates with Edward Said, the Palestinian American literary theorist whose aim was to deconstruct what he called Orientalist scholarship. Said, who was a professor at Columbia University, characterized Lewis' work as a prime example of Orientalism in his 1978 book \"Orientalism\" and in his later book \"Covering Islam\". Said asserted that the field of Orientalism was political intellectualism bent on self-affirmation rather than objective study, a form of racism, and a tool of imperialist domination. He further questioned the scientific neutrality of some leading Middle East scholars, including Lewis, on the Arab World. In an interview with \"Al-Ahram\" weekly, Said suggested that Lewis' knowledge of the Middle East was so biased that it could not be taken seriously and claimed \"Bernard Lewis hasn't set foot in the Middle East, in the Arab world, for at least 40 years. He knows something about Turkey, I'm told, but he knows nothing about the Arab world.\" Said considered that Lewis treats Islam as a monolithic entity without the nuance of its plurality, internal dynamics, and historical complexities, and accused him of \"demagogy and downright ignorance\". In \"Covering Islam\", Said argued that \"Lewis simply cannot deal with the diversity of Muslim, much less human life, because it is closed to him as something foreign, radically different, and other,\" and he criticised Lewis' \"inability to grant that the Islamic peoples are entitled to their own cultural, political, and historical practices, free from Lewis' calculated attempt to show that because they are not Western... they can't be good.\"\n\nRejecting the view that Western scholarship was biased against the Middle East, Lewis responded that Orientalism developed as a facet of European humanism, independently of the past European imperial expansion. He noted the French and English pursued the study of Islam in the 16th and 17th centuries, yet not in an organized way, but long before they had any control or hope of control in the Middle East; and that much of Orientalist study did nothing to advance the cause of imperialism. In his 1993 book \"Islam and the West\", Lewis wrote \"What imperial purpose was served by deciphering the ancient Egyptian language, for example, and then restoring to the Egyptians knowledge of and pride in their forgotten, ancient past?\"\n\nFurthermore, Lewis accused Said of politicizing the scientific study of the Middle East (and Arabic studies in particular); neglecting to critique the scholarly findings of the Orientalists; and giving \"free rein\" to his biases.\n\nIn 2002, Lewis wrote an article for the \"Wall Street Journal\" regarding the buildup to the Iraq War entitled \"Time for Toppling\", where he stated his opinion that \"a regime change may well be dangerous, but sometimes the dangers of inaction are greater than those of action\". In 2007, Jacob Weisberg described Lewis as \"perhaps the most significant intellectual influence behind the invasion of Iraq\". Michael Hirsh attributed to Lewis the view that regime change in Iraq would provide a jolt that would \"modernize the Middle East\" and suggested that Lewis' allegedly 'orientalist' theories about \"what went wrong\" in the Middle East, and other writings, formed the intellectual basis of the push towards war in Iraq. Hirsch reported that Lewis had told him in an interview that he viewed the September 11 attacks as \"the opening salvo of the final battle\" between Western and Islamic civilisations: Lewis believed that a forceful response was necessary. In the run up to the Iraq War, he met with Vice President Dick Cheney several times: Hirsch quoted an unnamed official who was present at a number of these meetings, who summarised Lewis' view of Iraq as \"Get on with it. Don’t dither\". Brent Scowcroft quoted Lewis as stating that he believed \"that one of the things you’ve got to do to Arabs is hit them between the eyes with a big stick. They respect power\". As'ad AbuKhalil has claimed that Lewis assured Cheney that American troops would be welcomed by Iraqis and Arabs, relying on the opinion of his colleague Fouad Ajami. Hirsch also drew parallels between the Bush administration's plans for post-invasion Iraq and Lewis' views, in particular his admiration for Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's secularist and Westernising reforms in the new Republic of Turkey which emerged from the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nWriting in 2008, Lewis did not advocate imposing freedom and democracy on Islamic nations. \"There are things you can't impose. Freedom, for example. Or democracy. Democracy is a very strong medicine which has to be administered to the patient in small, gradually increasing doses. Otherwise, you risk killing the patient. In the main, the Muslims have to do it themselves.\"\n\nIan Buruma, writing for \"The New Yorker\" in an article subtitled \"The two Minds of Bernard Lewis\", finds Lewis's stance on the war difficult to reconcile with Lewis' past statements cautioning democracy enforcement in the world at large. Buruma ultimately rejects suggestions by his peers that Lewis promotes war with Iraq to safeguard Israel, but instead concludes \"perhaps he loves it [the Arab world] too much\":\n\nHamid Dabashi, writing on 28 May 2018, in an article subtitled \"On Bernard Lewis and 'his extraordinary capacity for getting everything wrong'\", asked: \"Just imagine: What sort of a person would spend a lifetime studying people he loathes? It is quite a bizarre proposition. But there you have it: the late Bernard Lewis did precisely that.\" Similarly, Richard Bulliet described Lewis as \"...a person who does not like the people he is purporting to have expertise about...he doesn’t respect them, he considers them to be good and worthy only to the degree they follow a Western path\". According to As'ad AbuKhalil, \"Lewis has poisoned the Middle East academic field more than any other Orientalist and his influence has been both academic and political. But there is a new generation of Middle East experts in the West who now see clearly the political agenda of Bernard Lewis. It was fully exposed in the Bush years.\"\n\nIn 2006, Lewis wrote that Iran had been working on a nuclear weapon for fifteen years. In August 2006, in an article about whether the world can rely on the concept of mutual assured destruction as a deterrent in its dealings with Iran, Lewis wrote in the \"Wall Street Journal\" about the significance of 22 August 2006 in the Islamic calendar. The Iranian president had indicated he would respond by that date to U.S. demands regarding Iran's development of nuclear power. Lewis wrote that the date corresponded to the 27th day of the month of Rajab of the year 1427, the day Muslims commemorate the night flight of Muhammad from Jerusalem to heaven and back. Lewis wrote that it would be \"an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel and, if necessary, of the world\".\n\nAccording to Lewis, mutual assured destruction is not an effective deterrent in the case of Iran, because of what Lewis describes as the Iranian leadership's \"apocalyptic worldview\" and the \"suicide or martyrdom complex that plagues parts of the Islamic world today\". He then suggested the possibility of a nuclear strike on Israel on 22 August 2006:\nLewis' article received significant press coverage. However, the day passed without any incident.\n\nIn his 2009 book \"Engaging the Muslim World\", the American academic Juan Cole responded that there was no evidence to suggest that Iran had been working on a nuclear weapon for fifteen years. He also disagreed with Lewis' suggestion that Ahmadinejad \"might deploy this weapon against Israel on 22 August 2006\".\n\nBernard Lewis died on 19 May 2018 at the age of 101, at an assisted-living care facility in Voorhees Township, New Jersey, twelve days before his 102nd birthday.\n\n\n\n"}

Such a person may not have formal tribal or other authority (through for instance material possessions, or inheritance of rights), but can maintain recognition through skilled persuasion and wisdom. The big man has a large group of followers, both from his clan and from other clans. He provides his followers with protection and economic assistance, in return receiving support which he uses to increase his status.\n\nThe American anthropologist Marshall Sahlins has studied the big man phenomenon. In his much-quoted \n1963 article \"Poor Man, Rich Man, Big Man, Chief: Political Types in Melanesia and Polynesia\", Sahlins uses analytically constructed ideal-types of hierarchy and equality to compare a larger-scale Polynesian-type hierarchical society of chiefs and sub-chiefs with a Melanesian-type big-man system.\n\nThe latter consists of segmented lineage groups, locally held together by faction-leaders who compete for power in the social structure of horizontally arranged and principally equal groupings (factions). Here, leadership is not ascribed, but rather gained through action and competition \"with other ambitious men\".\n\nA big man's position is never secured in an inherited position at the top of a hierarchy, but is always challenged by the different big-men who compete with one another in an ongoing process of reciprocity and re-distribution of material and political resources. As such the big man is subject to a transactional order based on his ability to balance the simultaneously opposing pulls of securing his own renown through distributing resources to other big man groups (thereby spreading the word of his power and abilities) \"and\" redistributing resources to the people of his own faction (thereby keeping them content followers of his able leadership).\n\nThe big man concept is relatively fluid, and formal authority of such figures is very low to nonexistent. His position is not inherently heritable.\n\nIn the Island of Malaita in Solomon Islands the big man system is dying away as westernization is influencing the people, but the big man system can be seen at the political level. Every four years in Solomon Islands' National Elections the system can be clearly seen among the people, especially in the Melanesian Islands.\n\nThe first use of the term may be found in the English-translation of Dreissig Jahre in der Sudsee (1907) by Richard Parkinson. The term may be often found in many historical works dealing with Papua New Guinea. Andrew J. Strathern applies the concept of big-men to a community in Mount Hagen, Papua New Guinea.\n\nTraditionally, among peoples of non-Austronesian-speaking communities, authority was obtained by a man (the so-called \"big man\") recognised as \"performing most capably in social, political, economic and ceremonial activities\". His function was not to command, but to influence his society through his example. He was expected to act as a negotiator with neighbouring groups, and to periodically redistribute food (generally produced by his wives). In this sense, he was seen as ensuring the well-being of his community.\n\nSuch a system is still found in many parts of Papua New Guinea, and other parts of Melanesia.\n\n"}

Established in 1978, the Centre claimed to be the first higher educational Institute in Europe \"to concentrate solely on research and education that aims to benefit the Deaf community\". The Centre was at the forefront in establishing the disciplines of deaf studies and deafhood. It used British Sign Language (BSL), had a policy of bilingual communication in BSL and English, and employed a majority of deaf teaching staff.\n\nThe Centre offered Bachelor of Science (BSc) and Master of Science (MSc) courses, as well as research degrees at MPhil and PhD level. Bristol University announced plans to close the BSc course in May 2010 after a failed campaign by the centre's supporters and staff. By 2013 the Centre was being gradually shut down by the University, by means of a program of redundancies and staff attrition.\n\nThe Centre was founded in 1978. Early research into the acquisition and usage of BSL was the first funded research into the topic in the UK. In 1980, the Centre produced the first coding manual for BSL, followed by the first textbook on the language in 1985. In 1980, the Centre ran the first National Conference on Sign Language in the UK, and the following year it hosted the first International Conference on Sign Language to be held in the UK. It also organised the first International Deaf Researchers Workshop in 1985.\n\nIn 1984, the Centre coined the term \"deaf studies\", and in 2001, it established the first professorship in the discipline. Also in 2001, it employed a deaf director, the first time that the head of a European academic Centre had been deaf. In 2003, the book \"Understanding Deaf Culture: In Search of Deafhood\", by the Centre's researcher Paddy Ladd, popularised the term \"deafhood\", which Ladd had coined in 1990.\n\nResearch at the Centre fell into five areas: the language, linguistics and literature of sign language; acquisition of sign language; community and deaf culture, known as \"deafhood\"; cognition and psychology; and the applications of technology, such as videotelephony and e-learning. An audio-visual phone went on trial with the Avon and Somerset Police.\n\nThe Centre was an innovator in education. In 1981, it offered the first university-level certificate course in BSL for professionals. In 1985, it started a diploma course, social science in deaf studies. This was followed in 1987 by a part-time course in sign language interpretation, which became full-time in 1990. In 1992, the Centre established the earliest full-time, university-level training programme for Deaf people to be taught in sign language. In 1993, a Diploma of Higher Education was established, the earliest undergraduate course on deaf studies in the UK, and in 1999, the first BSc and MSc in deaf studies followed.\n\nBristol was one of a handful of universities in the UK to offer an undergraduate degree in deaf studies. In May 2010, the university announced plans to close the undergraduate course as part of a drive to save £15 million. The campaign against this focussed on the lack of justice in targeting staff and students with particular needs, and the aggressiveness of the University's approach to the CDS, led by the Dean, Dr Judith Squires. There were accusations that her Faculty saved other units only by sacrificing the CDS. The shutdown of the programme was successful and the last students from the undergraduate degree graduated in 2013.\n\nThe Centre offered until recently taught postgraduate courses: a certificate and diploma in deaf studies, and an MSc in Deaf Studies. The Centre also offered a range of short courses, including BSL, BSL interpreting and Deafhood studies. Deafstation, a daily news service in BSL, was run by the centre.\n\nIn 2012, close to closure, the Centre's director was Sandra Smith. The Harry Crook Professor in Deaf Studies was Jim Kyle, who was at Bristol for over 20 years and is a leading expert on Deaf policy. Other researchers included a Reader, Dr Paddy Ladd, a lecturer, Dr Sarah Batterbury, and several researchers. The majority of teaching staff were Deaf. In late 2012, the academic staff were offered part-time contracts only, or redundancy - to take effect in 2013. All accepted redundancy, except Prof. Kyle. The Deaf community accused Bristol University of trying to close the Centre through staff attrition; by shutting the undergraduate degree, they were able to claim that few staff were needed for teaching.\n\nThe University stopped admitting students in 2013. University Council passed a resolution with only a vote of dissent. It later emerged that the CDS building would be sold to a church.\n"}

The organization was committed to national prehistory and early history research and to providing a broad basis fo German Archeology as a discipline with a historical goal. In its first year the first edition of the magazine \"Mannus\" was published. In 1913, at a special general meeting, the change of name to \"Gesellschaft für Deutschen Vorgeschichte\" (GDV) was approved by a large majority. After Kossinna's death, Alfred Götze initially took over the leadership of the society. In 1933, in the course of \"Gleichschaltung\", the board decided to \"expand\" itself to the \"Reichsbund für Deutsche Vorgeschichte\" at the request of Hans Reinerth. This decision was confirmed a year later by the General Assembly. Also in 1934 Reinerth became leader (\"Bundesführer\") of the Reichsbund.\n\nIn 1968, the society was re-founded as the \"Gesellschaft für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Bonn)\" by Bolko von Richthofen. He again published a periodical called \"Mannus\". The members, who are mainly associated with right to far-right extremist views, included, among others the \"Atlantis Researchers\" Jürgen Spanuth, Herman Wirth, and Haye W. Hansen. \"Mannus\" was discontinued in 1994 after 24 issues. \n"}
{"id": "3608674", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3608674", "title": "Donor-advised fund", "text": "Donor-advised fund\n\nIn the United States, a donor-advised fund is a charitable giving vehicle administered by a public charity created to manage charitable donations on behalf of organizations, families, or individuals. To participate in a donor-advised fund, a donating individual or organization opens an account in the fund and deposits cash, securities, or other financial instruments. They surrender ownership of anything they put in the fund, but retain advisory privileges over how their account is invested, and how it distributes money to charities.\n\nA donor-advised fund provides a flexible way for donors to pass money through to charities—an alternative to direct giving or creating a private foundation. Donors enjoy administrative convenience (the sponsoring organization does the paperwork after the initial donation), cost savings (a foundation requires around 2.5% to 4% of its assets each year to run), and tax advantages (versus individual giving) by conducting their grantmaking through the fund.\n\nA donor-advised fund has some disadvantages compared to a private foundation, and some advantages. Both can accept donations of unusual or illiquid assets (e.g., part ownership of a private company, art, real estate, partnerships or limited partnership shares), but a donor advised fund has higher deductions for these gifts (depending on the gift). In addition, the founders or board of a private foundation have complete control over where its giving goes within broad legal bounds. In a donor-advised fund, the donor only \"advises\" the sponsoring organization where the money should go. While rare, a sponsoring organization could conceivably ignore the donor's intent. In addition, most donor-advised funds can only give to IRS certified 501(c)(3) organizations or their foreign equivalents. This rules out, for example, most kinds of donations to individuals, and scholarships—both things a private foundation can do more easily. Donor-advised funds do reap a significant cost advantage (foundations carry a 2.5-4% of assets overhead expense to maintain, a 1-2% excise tax on NET investment earnings and a required 5% spending of assets each year) but may also have one more drawback---limited lifetime, although this varies depending on the sponsor. American Endowment Foundation for example allows successor advisors in perpetuity. While a foundation can persist for generations or in perpetuity, some sponsoring organizations impose a \"sunset\" on donor-advised funds, after which they collapse individual funds into their general charity pool.\n\nBecause a public charity houses the fund, donors receive the maximum tax deduction available, while avoiding excise taxes and other restrictions imposed on private foundations. Further, donors avoid the cost of establishing and administering a private foundation, including staffing and legal fees. The donor receives the maximum tax deduction at the time they donate to their account, and the foundation that administers the fund gains full control over the contribution, granting the donor advisory status. As such, the administrating fund is not legally bound to the donor, but makes grants to other public charities on the donor's \"recommendation\". Most foundations that offer donor-advised funds only make grants from these funds to other public charities, and usually perform due diligence to verify the grantee's tax-exempt status.\n\nDrexel University environmental sociologist Robert Brulle, who has studied networks of nonprofit funding, described donor-advised funds:\n\nIn this type of foundation, individuals or other foundations contribute money to the donor directed foundation, and it then makes grants based on the stated preferences of the original contributor. This process ensures that the intent of the contributor is met while also hiding that contributor's identity. Because contributions to a donor directed foundation are not required to be made public, their existence provides a way for individuals or corporations to make anonymous contributions.\n\nWhitney Ball, co-founder and executive director of the donor-advised fund Donors Trust, described donor-advised funds:\n\nA donor-advised fund begins with a donor contributing cash or assets to a public charity, which in turn creates a separate account for the donor, who may recommend disbursements from the fund to other public charities. Technically, the charity that sponsors the fund has final say on the disbursements, and it is legally required to ensure they go only to charitable purposes, but in normal circumstances the original donor's requests will be followed.\n\nNowadays, donor-advised funds are even less like traditional foundations. The simultaneous growth of DAFs \"and\" online giving has led to some, like CharityBox, that are run by start-up companies through a web/mobile platform. Such companies allow donors to give directly to 501(c)(3) organizations and instantly receive tax-deductible receipts via email.\n\nThe New York Community Trust pioneered donor-advised funds in 1931. Though the second such fund was not created until 1935, the field has greatly expanded since, as commercial sponsors, educational institutions, and independent charities started offering the service. Donor-advised funds are the fastest growing charitable giving vehicle in the U.S.—more than 269,000 donor-advised accounts, hold over $78 billion in assets.\n\nCurrent U.S. tax law allows the donor of appreciated securities or other assets to get a tax deduction for the market value of the donation and avoid capital gains taxes. This double tax advantage can make donating appreciated assets to a charitable organization more attractive than selling the assets and donating cash. By donating appreciated assets to a donor-advised fund and then advising the fund to make donations to several charities, one can reap these tax advantages without the hassle and paperwork of transferring non-cash assets to several organizations. This combination of convenience and full tax advantage is one reason that donor-advised funds are used.\n\nWhile private foundations in the United States are heavily regulated by the Internal Revenue Service, including rules on oversight and minimum annual payouts, donor-advised funds housed in public charities are not subject to the same tax restrictions.\n\nIn 1985, National Foundation, Inc. (NFI, now WaterStone), defended its standard for the management of donor-advised funds against the Internal Revenue Service in the United States tax court in National Foundation, Inc. v. United States. The court found that NFI was eligible for tax-exemption and could be classified as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based on their management of donor-advised funds. NFI had complete control and ownership of what would later be called donor-advised funds, and could exercise discretion in authorizing charitable distributions of the funds. Donors maintained advisory privileges, but NFI was not obligated to use the funds based on their recommendations, especially if the receiving party did not comply with the five standards of a charitable organization, identified by the court: 1) that it be consistent with the charitable purposes specified in section 501(c)(3); (2) that it have a reasonable budget; (3) that it be adequately funded; (4) that it be staffed by competent and well trained personnel; and (5) that it be capable of effective monitoring and supervision by NFI. The outcome of this case opened the door for many other providers to launch donor-advised fund programs.\nOn August 17, 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (H.R. 4) into law, which includes a number of changes to the regulatory framework for donor-advised funds, and follows both House and Senate passage of H.R. 4. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 established guidelines for the management of donor-advised funds, using NFI's standards as a framework. The sections dealing with donor-advised funds include:\n\n\nThe following example is taken from Vanguard's marketing material for their plan:\n\nSuppose you have 1,000 shares of stock that you purchased 15 years ago (thus, you're in long term capital gains territory). Assume that you purchased the stock for $10 per share and it is now worth $100 per share. Now, let's compare the cost to the donor of making a contribution of $100,000 to a charity of your choice. We assume a 35% income tax rate and 15% long term capital gains tax rate.\n\nOption 1: Contribute cash from sale of securities\n\nCharity receives $100,000 for a net cost to donor of $78,500\n\nOption 2: Contribute appreciated securities\n\nCharity receives $100,000 for a net cost to donor of $65,000\n\nThus, by donating appreciated securities rather than selling them, one can contribute the same total amount with reduced effective donor cost. This is true whether or not one uses a donor-advised fund.\n\nIf the securities increase in value after they have been given to the donor-advised fund (but before the grant recommendation is actually made), no additional tax deduction can be claimed by the taxpayer. On the other hand, if the securities decrease in value, the taxpayer's original tax deduction (based on the value of the securities when given to the donor-advised fund) remains valid.\n\nEven though the tax efficiency is the same, there are differences between giving directly to a charity and giving via a donor-advised fund.\n\n\nHowever, there is a cost to donor-advised funds. Most donor-advised funds charge an administrative fee (e.g., 1% per year). This is in addition to management fees that, for example, any mutual funds the donor fund is invested in.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21088598", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21088598", "title": "Entropa", "text": "Entropa\n\nEntropa is a sculpture by Czech artist David Černý. The project was commissioned by the Czech Republic to mark the occasion of its presidency of the Council of the European Union, and was originally designed as a collaboration for 27 artists and artist groups from all member countries of the European Union. However, as a hoax, Černý and three of his assistants created a satirical and controversial piece that depicted pointed stereotypes of the EU member nations. Fake artist profiles were also created by Černý and his accomplices, complete with invented descriptions of their supposed contributions.\n\nThe sculpture was unveiled informally on 12 January 2009, followed by its official media launch date three days later. The sculpture was originally on display in the Justus Lipsius building in Brussels. Between September 2010 and March 2012, the sculpture was on exhibit at the Techmania Science Center in Plzeň. A copy of the sculpture has also been planned for the Nová Scéna cafe in the National Theatre in Prague.\n\nThe Council of the European Union adheres to a rotational presidency system, whereby the governments of member countries exchange leadership every six months. It is customary for the presiding country to place an exhibit in the Justus Lipsius building, with past works avoiding controversy. For example, France, which had held the presidency before the Czech Republic, simply erected a large balloon in the French national colours in honor of the tradition.\n\n\"Entropa\" is an ironic jab at the issue of European integration and the stereotypes associated with each country within the European Union. It is subtitled '\"Stereotypes are barriers to be demolished\", along with the Czech European Union Presidency's motto of \"Europe without barriers\". According to David Černý, the sculpture's primary artist, \"Entropa\" \"lampoons the socially activist art that balances on the verge between would-be controversial attacks on national character and undisturbing decoration of an official space\". In an interview with \"The Times Online\", Černý stated that the sculpture was influenced by the Monty Python brand of humour. At the launch ceremony, he added Sacha Baron Cohen and \"Les Guignols de l'info\"s portrayal of Nicolas Sarkozy as other influences.\n\nThe work is made of glass-reinforced plastic and the joints of steel. It covers approximately , measuring high and wide. Three-quarters of the weight comes from the frame, making up a combined total of 8 tonnes. It resembles the parts of a model kit, containing pieces in the shapes of the 27 member states of the EU. Each piece has a distinctive theme that portrays stereotypes about the country, some of which are portrayed in a particularly provocative manner. Among the pieces which have attracted the most attention are those of Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Poland and Slovakia.\n\nThe sculpture was installed between 5 and 11 January 2009 in the presence of David Černý, three assistants, four climbers, two technicians, two cameramen and a representative of the Czech Permanent Representation to the EU.\n\nWith no clear indication made by the artist nor by the official presentation, various interpretations of a single country can be drawn, and this list is by no means definite. Some of the physical pieces differ slightly from the form presented in the official booklet:\n\n\n\"Entropa\" has inspired debate in Europe since the day of its first unveiling. Various commentators have noted that this is probably the first such exhibition in the history of art displays on behalf of the rotary Presidency of the EU Council that has been controversial in nature, contrasted by the fact that such pieces usually go by unnoticed. The work drew what has been described by one reporter as \"a never-before-seen crowd.\" It has been praised by some viewers for being \"hilarious\" and for inspiring discussion about art, but has angered and offended others.\n\nIn June 2009, David Černý himself said that he expected completely different reactions than those described below. In his opinion, Bulgaria doesn't even make it to the top three of the most provocative countries caricatured by \"Entropa\". The most provocative country is Poland, with the reference to gays. It is followed by the UK (missing) and Slovakia that, according to Mr Černý, is a bubble restricted by Hungary.\n\nOn 13 January 2009, the day after the exhibit was informally unveiled, Bulgaria's ambassador to the EU registered the country's protest with the European Commission, and sent a formal protest note to the Czech government. Bulgaria's depiction in the sculpture, as a series of squat toilets, is one of the most provocative, and after the informal unveiling of \"Entropa\", the Bulgarian government demanded that the sculpture be taken down before its official launching. This action was never taken, but after continuing complaints, the Bulgarian depiction was covered with black fabric on 20 January 2009. Individuals outside the government, as well, expressed outrage about the portrayal:\n\nBulgarian news portal News.bg commented that the country's deputy was \"obviously interpreting [the exhibit's] idea as an insult attempt.\" A number of non-government organizations, including Polish Indeks 73, were opposed to covering part of the work and initiated online petitions.\n\nJan Vytopil, the man in charge of cultural events during the Czech EU Presidency, has defended the exhibit, arguing that the presence of a \"squat toilet Bulgaria\" in the presence of the other patently absurd depictions made it clear that the piece seeks to demolish stereotypes rather than cause controversy. Czech Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra also frequently stressed that the government committee which authorized the piece wanted to avoid censorship:\nOn 14 January 2009, the Slovak National Party called on Foreign Affairs Minister Ján Kubiš to demand the removal of the sculpture, calling it an offence to the Slovak nation. On 15 January 2009, Kubiš complied and lodged a formal protest, but did not demand the removal of the sculpture.\n\nGiven the controversial nature of the portrayals of other countries, Czech diplomats expected protests from other countries as well. However, these had yet to materialize. In fact, the public in Poland appeared to be largely in favour of Poland's portrayal, with 64% considering it \"spot on\" and only 13% thinking it \"an insult to Polish people\", according to an online poll by news portal TVN24.\n\nOle Molesby, the Danish Ambassador to the Czech Republic, stated that he did not expect the Mohammed caricature protests to begin anew, and that Denmark did not intend to complain. Černý denied that the similarity was intentional.\n\nOn 13 January 2009, the authorship of \"Entropa\" came into question. Officially, the artwork was to have been an international collaboration between David Černý and artists from the other 26 EU countries. However, on that day, Alexandr Vondra announced the work was probably created by a smaller group of people, explaining that Černý did not inform him about this until the evening before. The original news article in \"Lidové noviny\" pointed out that some of the artists' names did not seem to exist in their countries' citizen records and had no Internet footprint. Černý himself admitted on 13 January that the artists' names had been fabricated.\n\nThe official booklet provided summaries of past expositions for most of the alleged authors, some of which matched those of known artists. For example, Austria's \"Sabrina Unterberger\" had a résumé that apparently belonged to Ernst Logar. Many of these \"artists\" had their own websites (designed by Tomáš Pospiszyl, Krištof Kintera and Libor Svoboda), but the contact information listed was false (other than the e-mail addresses, which were functional).\n\n\"Lidové noviny\" originally listed Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland, and the UK as countries for which fictitious artists' identities were given. These specific claims were later retracted and replaced by general charges that some of the names in the booklet are non-existent, their résumés erroneous, or that the artists denied knowing David Černý or having cooperated with him.\n\nOn the evening of 13 January 2009, Černý officially admitted that the piece was actually created entirely by him and two friends, and that all the officially supplied artists' identities had been fabricated. In a prepared statement, Černý offered an apology to Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra, and the Czech Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg \"and their offices\" for deceiving them, stating he did not want them to be responsible for his fabulations. The statement went on to point out: \"We knew the truth would come out. But before that we wanted to find out if Europe is able to laugh at itself.\"\n\nThe names of Černý's collaborators were given as Tomáš Pospiszyl and Krištof Kintera. The authors maintained that a larger international team of people was involved in the project's execution. They explained that they originally wanted to contact artists from all 27 member countries of the EU, but failed due to limited time and financing. Alexandr Vondra responded with an official statement expressing his disappointment and stressed that Černý would bear responsibility for deceiving the government.\n\nDue to the sculpture's potential for controversy, the point that each country's piece was designed by an artist from that country was strongly stressed by the Czech government. According to Lidové noviny, Czech Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra remarked: \"The fact remains that we have provided a platform for free artistic expression and that is how \"Entropa\" must be viewed. But, had I known the circumstances were different than we had thought for a year and a half, I would not have authorized it.\" Vondra attempted to distance the Czech government from Černý's work early on, saying,It is a piece of art—nothing else... If Europe is not strong enough to look at this, it would be a tragedy. It is Europe through the eyes of 27 artists. It is not Europe through the eyes of the Czech presidency.\n\nThe sculpture reportedly cost 12 million CZK to make, of which 10 million was contributed by New World Resources, a Dutch mining company which owns OKD in the Czech Republic, and 2 million CZK was paid by the Czech government, which has subsequently leased the work for an additional 1.2 million CZK until the end of June. After the fabrication came to light, Černý was accused of misappropriating state funds. He responded that the money was not used at all, since the artists knew they would deviate from the stated project, and would be returned.\n\nČerný originally stated that he meant for the sculpture to be amusing, saying, \"Irony is about making fun. It is not meant to offend anybody\", and later issuing an official statement saying, \"We wanted to see if Europe is able to laugh at itself.\" On 15 January, Černý reflected on the hostile reception of \"Entropa\":\nI certainly don't feel like a winner. That's how I'd feel if there were a few shocked Brusselian bureaucrats walking around the piece, shaking their heads, thinking about what those Czechs have done here. We expected this to be treated as a joke, a happening, a nice installation, nothing else. That we are already discussing the removal of some parts doesn't seem like a tremendous success to me. I'd be much happier if it remained whole.\n\nThe authors defended their choice to use false names in creating the sculpture by stating the deception was part of the art:\nGrotesque exaggeration and mystification is a hallmark of Czech culture, and creating false identities is one of the strategies of contemporary art.\nČerný has also said that making this sculpture in this way was \"more fun.\" Later, however, the artists apologized for the deception, saying, \"We apologize to Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, Deputy Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra, Minister Karel Schwarzenberg and their offices for not informing them about the true state of things and thus deceiving them.\" Krištof Kintera, one of the true co-authors of the sculpture, said in an interview that the mystification was supposed to last longer, but that it was untenable—both ethically, as the artists didn't want to cause more trouble for Czech diplomacy, and practically, as they couldn't keep answering e-mails using the fabricated artists' identities.\n\nKintera also commented that the sculpture revealed a divide between Western and Eastern Europe: \"We didn't want to defame anyone; advanced European democracies are used to many things, but the East still strives to promote itself in a positive light, so it's not as well attuned to this.\"\n\nAfter the true authorship of the sculpture came to light, Alexandr Vondra stated its continued display was under review because Černý had violated the government's specifications of the project, which, in line with Černý's original description, called for an international collaboration of artists. On 14 January 2009, the official \"Entropa\" presentation page was withdrawn from the Czech presidency's website. Nevertheless, the sculpture was ceremonially launched on 15 January 2009. Alexandr Vondra again defended the piece, saying, \"we consider \"Entropa\" to be art, nothing more and nothing else.\"\n\nDuring the ceremony, David Černý again apologized to the Czech government and expressed regret that the sculpture was considered offensive. He said the offending pieces would be removed if officials cannot be persuaded about the authors' intentions.\n\nOn 23 April 2009, Černý's intention to remove the sculpture prematurely on 10 May was published, which he presented as a protest against the way in which Topolánek's government had been deposed and against the prepared Fischer's cabinet, which was eventually installed on 8 May.\n\nThe removal of the sculpture began on 11 May. Černý himself was not present, although he had earlier suggested the contrary. A crew he sent there dismantled the sculpture and on Thursday, 14 May loaded its parts into three trucks, which had to come one by one because of limitations of the Justus Lipsius building. Afterwards, the pieces were transported by road to Prague.\n\nThe sculpture was set up again in the Centre of Contemporary Art DOX in Prague-Holešovice and inaugurated on 11 June 2009, in presence of guests, including former Czech president Václav Havel.\n\"Entropa\" was on display in the Techmania Science Center in Plzeň as part of an EU exhibition.\n\n\n"}

The popularity of this genre of musical theatre depended, in part, on the beautiful dancing corps of \"Gaiety Girls\" appearing onstage in bathing attire and in the latest fashions. The 1890s Gaiety Girls were respectable, elegant young ladies, unlike the corseted actresses from London's earlier musical burlesques. Later, even the stars of these musical comedies were referred to as Gaiety Girls.\n\nAn American newspaper reviewing \"A Gaiety Girl\" in 1894 explained the importance of the Gaiety Girls: \"The piece is a mixture of pretty girls, English humor, singing, dancing and bathing machines and dresses of the English fashion. The dancing is a special feature of the performance, English burlesques giving much more attention to that feature of their attractiveness than the American entertainments of the same grade do.\" Many of the best-known London couturiers designed costumes for stage productions by the 1890s. The illustrated periodicals were eager to publish photographs of the actresses in the latest stage hits, and so the theatre became an excellent way for clothiers to publicise their latest fashions.\nGaiety girls were polite, well-behaved young women. They became a popular attraction and a symbol of ideal womanhood. Edwardes arranged with Romano's Restaurant, on the Strand, for his girls to dine there at half-price. It was good exposure for the girls and made Romano's the centre of London's night-life. Many of the Gaiety Girls, such as Marie Studholme, Ellaline Terriss, Lily Elsie, Cicely Courtneidge, Gladys Cooper, Phyllis Dare, Zena Dare, Mabel Love, Evelyn Laye, Jennie McNulty, Gaby Deslys, Camille Clifford, Gabrielle Ray, Sylvia Grey and Constance Collier, later enjoyed substantial acting careers. One Gaiety Girl, Mabel Russell, became a Member of Parliament.\n\nThe young ladies appearing in Edwardes's shows became so popular that wealthy gentlemen, termed \"Stage Door Johnnies\", would wait outside the stage door hoping to escort them to dinner. In some cases, a marriage into society and even the nobility resulted. For example, May Gates, a chorus girl in \"The Beauty of Bath\", married a nobleman, Baron Von Ditton, of Norway. Similarly, Sylvia Lillian Storey (1890-1947) another chorister in the same show, married William Poulett, 7th Earl Poulett. Maudi Darrell and Lily Elsie both married the same wealthy Scotsman, Ian Durrough. Gertie Millar became the Countess of Dudley, and Olive May married into the peerage twice. First, she became Lady Victor Paget (marrying in 1913 and divorcing in 1921) and then the Countess of Drogheda (marrying the 10th Earl in 1922). The potential for such relationships was an underlying theme of many of the stories of P. G. Wodehouse, particularly those set at Blandings Castle.\n\nAlan Hyman, an expert on burlesque theatre who penned the 1972 book \"The Gaiety Years\", wrote:\nAt the old Gaiety in the Strand the chorus was becoming a matrimonial agency for girls with ambitions to marry into the peerage and began in the nineties when Connie Gilchrist, a star of the Old Gaiety, married the 7th Earl of Orkney and then in 1901, the 4th Marquess of Headfort married Rosie Boote, who had charmed London the previous year when she sang Maisie in \"The Messenger Boy\". After Connie Gilchrist and Rosie Boote had started the fashion a score of the Guv'nor's budding stars left him to marry peers or men of title while other Gaiety Girls settled for a banker or a stockbroker. The Guv’nor finding this was playing ducks and drakes with his theatrical plans had a 'nuptial clause' inserted in every contract... Debutantes were competing with the other girls to get into the Gaiety chorus while upper-class youths were joining the ranks of the chorus boys.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "752702", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=752702", "title": "Guttural R", "text": "Guttural R\n\nIn common parlance, \"guttural R\" is the phenomenon whereby a rhotic consonant (an \"R-like\" sound) is produced in the back of the vocal tract (usually with the uvula) rather than in the front portion thereof and thus as a guttural consonant. Speakers of languages with guttural R typically regard guttural and coronal rhotics to be alternative pronunciations of the same phoneme, despite articulatory differences. Similar consonants are found in other parts of the world, but they often have little to no cultural association or interchangeability with coronal rhotics (such as , , and ) and are (perhaps) not rhotics at all.\n\nThe guttural realization of a lone rhotic consonant is typical in most of what is now France, French speaking Belgium, most of Germany, large parts of the Netherlands, Denmark, the southern parts of Sweden and southwestern parts of Norway; it is also frequent in Flanders, and among all French- and some German speakers in Switzerland and also in eastern Austria, including Vienna. German speakers who use the frontal-R now mainly live in the Alps or close by.\n\nOutside of central Europe, it also occurs as the normal pronunciation of one of two rhotic phonemes (usually replacing an older alveolar trill) in most of Portugal, various parts of Brazil, among minorities of other Portuguese-speaking regions, and in parts of Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic.\n\nThe French rhotic has a wide range of realizations: both the voiced uvular fricative or approximant and the voiceless uvular fricative , the uvular trill , the alveolar trill , and the alveolar tap . These are all recognized as the phoneme , but the trills and the tap are considered dialectal. was once typical of a working class Parisian accent, and is sometimes found in southern France, as well as (increasingly less) in North America.\n\nToday in northern France, is commonly pronounced as a voiced uvular fricative , and voiceless after a voiceless consonant by assimilation. is also the most common pronunciation in the French media. In much of southern France, this guttural R has replaced the traditional alveolar trill , which can now only be heard among the oldest speakers.\n\nIt is not known when the guttural rhotic entered the French language, but it may have become commonplace in the mid or late 18th century. Molière's \"Le Bourgeois gentilhomme\", published in 1670, has a professor describe the sound of as an alveolar trill (Act II, Scene IV).\n\nIn Quebec French, speakers from rural areas and older generations traditionally use an alveolar trill, as was the pronunciation that was likely retained after the French colonists in Canada were isolated from France. However, most urban Quebeckers and the French-language broadcast media have adopted the modern guttural rhotic pronunciation of Paris, perhaps as the result of influence by modern French media from France.\n\nGenerally speaking, classical choral and operatic French pronunciation requires the use of an alveolar trill when singing, since an alveolar trill is easier to project than any guttural sound, be it a uvular trill or a uvular fricative.\n\nStandard versions of Portuguese have two rhotic phonemes, which contrast only between vowels. In older Portuguese, these were the alveolar flap (written ) and the alveolar trill (written ). In other positions, only is written in Modern Portuguese, but it can stand for either sound, depending on the exact position. The distribution of these sounds is mostly the same as in other Iberian languages, i.e.:\n\nIn the 19th century, the uvular trill penetrated the upper classes in the region of Lisbon in Portugal as the realization of the alveolar trill. By the 20th century, it had replaced the alveolar trill in most of the country's urban areas and started to give way to the voiced uvular fricative . Many northern dialects, like Transmontano, Portuese (which is heard in parts of Aveiro), Minhoto, and much of Beirão retain the alveolar trill, but other dialects of the inner center of Portugal have a guttural R with an uncertain origin. In the rural regions, the alveolar trill is still present, but because most of the country's population currently lives in or near the cities and owing to the mass media,the guttural is now dominant in Portugal.\n\nA common realization of the word-initial in the Lisbon accent is a voiced uvular trill fricative .\n\nThe dialect of the fishermen of Setúbal used the voiced uvular fricative for all instances of \"r\" — word start, intervocalic, postconsonantal and syllable ending. This same pronunciation is attested in people with rhotacism, in a new developing variety of young people in São Tomean Portuguese (Bouchard, 2017), and in non-native speakers of French or German origin.\n\nIn Africa, the classical alveolar trill is mostly still dominant, due to separate development from European Portuguese.\n\nIn Brazil, the normal pronunciation of is voiceless, either as a voiceless velar fricative , voiceless uvular fricative or a voiceless glottal fricative . In many dialects, this voiceless sound not only replaces all occurrences of the traditional trill, but is also used for all that is \"not\" followed by a vowel (i.e. when at the end of a syllable, which uses a flap in other dialects). The resulting distribution can be described as:\n\nIn the three southernmost states, however, the alveolar trill remains frequent, and the distribution of trill and flap is as in Portugal. Some speakers use a guttural fricative instead of a trill, like the majority of Brazilians, but continue to use the flap before consonants (e.g. in \"quarto\") and between vowels (e.g. in caro). Among others, this includes many speakers in the city of São Paulo and some neighboring cities, though an alveolar approximant is also common, not only in the city, but the approximant is the dominant articulation in rural parts of São Paulo state, the most populous state in Brazil. The \"caipira\" dialect has the alveolar approximant in the same position.\n\nIn areas where at the end of a word would be a voiceless fricative, the tendency in colloquial speech is to pronounce this sound very lightly, or omit it entirely. Some speakers may omit it entirely in verb infinitives (\"amar\" \"to love\", \"comer\" \"to eat\", \"dormir\" \"to sleep\") but pronounce it lightly in some other words ending in (\"mar\" \"sea\", \"mulher\" \"woman\", \"amor\" \"love\"). This tendency also occurs in some African countries; but speakers in Rio often resist the tendency, pronouncing a strong fricative or at the end of such words.\n\nThe voiceless fricative may be partly or fully voiced if it occurs directly before a voiced sound, especially in its weakest form of , which is normally voiced to . For example, a speaker whose sounds like will often pronounce \"surdo\" \"deaf\" as or even , with a very slight epenthetic vowel that mimics the preceding vowel.\n\nIn most Spanish-speaking territories and regions, guttural or uvular realizations of are considered a speech defect. Generally the single flap , spelled \"r\" as in \"cara\", undergoes no defective pronunciations, but the alveolar trill in \"rata\" or \"perro\" is one of the last sounds learned by children and uvularization is likely among individuals who fail to achieve the alveolar articulation. This said, back variants for (, or ) are widespread in rural Puerto Rican Spanish and in the variety of Ponce, whereas they are heavily stigmatized in the variety of the capital. To a lesser extent, velar variants of /r/ are found in some rural Cuban (Yatera, Guantánamo Province) and Dominican vernaculars (El Cibao, eastern rural regions of the country)\nIn the Basque-speaking areas of Spain, the uvular articulation has a higher prevalence among bilinguals than among Spanish monolinguals.\n\nGuttural realization of is mostly considered a speech defect in Italian (cf. ), but the so-called \"r moscia\" which is sometimes uvular is quite common in some northern areas, such as Piedmont, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna.\n\nThe uvular trill and the voiced uvular fricative or approximant are common in some Occitan dialects (Provence, Auvergne, Alps, Limousin). The dialects from Languedoc and Gascony also know these realizations, but it is generally considered to be an influence from French and therefore rejected from the standard versions of these dialects.\n\nThe Breton language, spoken in Brittany (France), is a Celtic language rather than a Romance language, but is heavily influenced by French. It retains an alveolar trill in some dialects, like in Léon and Morbihan, but most dialects now have the same rhotic as French, .\n\nThe uvular rhotic is most common in Central German dialects and in Standard German. Many Low Franconian, Low Saxon, and Upper German varieties have also adopted it with others maintaining the alveolar trill (). The development of uvular rhotics in these regions is not entirely understood, but a common theory is that these languages have done so because of French influence, though the reason for uvular rhotics in modern European French itself is not well understood (see above).\n\nThe Frisian languages usually retain an alveolar rhotic.\n\nIn modern Dutch, quite a few different rhotic sounds are used. In Flanders, the usual rhotic is an alveolar trill, but the uvular rhotic does occur, mostly in the province of Limburg, in Ghent and in Brussels. In the Netherlands, the uvular rhotic is the dominant rhotic in the southern provinces of Noord-Brabant and Limburg, having become so in the early twentieth century. In the rest of the country, the situation is more complicated. The uvular rhotic is dominant, in the western agglomeration Randstad, including cities like Rotterdam, The Hague and Utrecht (the dialect of Amsterdam usually has an alveolar rhotic though, but the uvular is becoming increasingly more common). The uvular rhotic is also used in some major cities outside of the Randstad area, such as Zwolle, Almelo and Leeuwarden. Outside of these uvular rhotic core areas, the alveolar trill is common. People learning Dutch as a foreign language also tend to use the alveolar trill because it contrasts better with the voiceless velar fricative in Dutch. The Afrikaans language of South Africa also uses an alveolar trill for its rhotic, except in the non-urban rural regions around Cape Town, chiefly in the town of Malmesbury, where it is uvular (called a brei). Some Afrikaans speakers from other areas also brei, either as a result of ancestry from the Malmesbury region or from difficulty pronouncing the alveolar trill.\n\nAlthough the first standardized pronunciation dictionary by Theodor Siebs prescribed an alveolar pronunciation, most varieties of Standard German are spoken with a uvular rhotic, now usually a fricative or approximant , rather than . The alveolar pronunciation is used in some standard German varieties of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. It remains more common in non-standard varieties in many parts of the language area. Chiefly in Central German, however, even the broadest rural dialects use a uvular R.\n\nRegardless of whether a uvular or an alveolar pronunciation is used, German post-vocalic \"r\" is typically vocalized to , , or a simple lengthening . This is most common in the syllable coda, as in non-rhotic English, but often occurs before an underlying schwa, too. Vocalization of \"r\" is rare only in Alemannic and Swabian German.\n\nThe upper/lower distinction also historically influenced the development of upper and lower dialects of Yiddish, the historic vernacular language of Ashkenazi Jews. As these Jews migrated to Eastern Europe (and later America etc.), they brought their particular pronunciations with them.\n\nHistorically, English also had an alveolar trill [r] for the letter R, but it was replaced by an alveolar approximant [ɹ].\n\nSpeakers of the traditional English dialect of Northumberland and northern County Durham use a uvular rhotic, known as the \"Northumbrian Burr\". However, it is no longer used by most contemporary speakers, who generally realize as an alveolar approximant, , in common with other varieties spoken in the English-speaking world.\n\nThe Hiberno-English of northeastern Leinster in Ireland also uses a uvular .\n\nAlveolar rhotics predominate in northern Scandinavia. Where they occur, they affect the succeeding alveolars, turning the clusters and , , , retroflex: . Thus the Norwegian word \"norsk\" is pronounced by speakers with an alveolar flap. This effect is rare in the speech of those using a uvular R ().\n\nThe rhotic used in Denmark is a voiced uvular approximant, and the nearby Swedish ex-Danish regions of Scania, Blekinge, southern Halland as well as a large part of Småland and on the Öland island, use a uvular trill or a uvular fricative.\n\nTo some extent in Östergötland and still quite commonly in Västergötland, a mixture of guttural and rolling rhotic consonants is used, with the pronunciation depending on the position in the word, the stress of the syllable and in some varieties depending on whether the consonant is geminated. The pronunciation remains if a word that is pronounced with a particular rhotic consonant is put into a compound word in a position where that realization would not otherwise occur if it were part of the same stem as the preceding sound. However, in Östergötland the pronunciation tends to gravitate more towards [w] and in Västergötland the realization is commonly voiced.\nCommon from the time of Gustav III (Swedish king 1771-1792), who was much inspired by French culture and language, was the use of guttural R in the nobility and in the upper classes of Stockholm. This phenomenon vanished in the 1900s. The last well-known non-Southerner who spoke with a guttural R, and didn't have a speech defect, was Anders Gernandt, a popular equitation commentator on TV.\n\nMost of Norway uses an alveolar flap, but about one third of the inhabitants of Norway are now using the uvular rhotic. In the western and southern part of South Norway, however, the uvular rhotic is still spreading. The origin was the city of Bergen. Because retroflex consonants are mutations of and other alveolar or dental consonants, the use of a uvular rhotic means an absence of most retroflex consonants.\n\nWhile the use of an alveolar trill or flap is generalized among speakers of Icelandic, a uvular rhotic is a fairly common pronunciation variant in the language, although it is usually frowned upon as defective pronunciation and compared to stammering and other similar speech disorders.\n\nIn Slavic languages, the alveolar trill predominates, with the use of guttural rhotics seen as defective pronunciation. An exception are the languages of the Sorbian minority in Saxony, eastern Germany, which are typically spoken with a uvular trill due to German influence. The uvular rhotic may also be found in a small minority in Silesia and other German-influenced regions of Poland and also Slovenia, but is overall quite rare even in these regions. It can also be perceived as an ethnic marker of Jewishness, particularly in Russian where Eastern European Jews often carried the uvular rhotic from their native Yiddish into their pronunciation of Russian.\n\nIn Hebrew, the classical pronunciation associated with the consonant ' was tapped , and was grammatically treated as an ungeminable phoneme of the language. In most dialects of Hebrew among the Jewish diaspora, it remained a tap or a trill . However, in some Ashkenazi dialects as preserved among Jews in northern Europe it was a uvular rhotic, either a trill or a fricative . This was because many (but not all) native dialects of Yiddish were spoken that way, and their liturgical Hebrew carried the same pronunciation. Some Iraqi Jews also pronounce ' as a guttural , reflecting their dialect of Arabic.\n\nAn apparently unrelated uvular rhotic is believed to have appeared in the Tiberian vocalization of Hebrew, where it is believed to have coexisted with additional non-guttural, emphatic articulations of depending on circumstances.\n\nAlthough an Ashkenazi Jew in the Russian Empire, the Zionist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda based his Standard Hebrew on Sephardi Hebrew, originally spoken in Spain, and therefore recommended an alveolar . However, just like him, the first waves of Jews to resettle in the Holy Land were Ashkenazi, and Standard Hebrew would come to be spoken with their native pronunciation. Consequently, by now nearly all Israeli Jews pronounce the consonant ר \"rêš\" as a unique uvular approximant , specifically [ʁ̞]., which also exists in Yiddish.\n\nThe alveolar rhotic is still used today in some formal occasions, just as radio news broadcasts, and in the past was widely used in television and singing.\n\nMany Jewish immigrants to Israel spoke a variety of Arabic in their countries of origin and pronounced the Hebrew rhotic as an alveolar tap , similar to Arabic '. Gradually, many of them began pronouncing their Hebrew rhotic as a voiced uvular fricative , a sound similar or (depending on the Arabic dialect) identical to Arabic '. However, in modern Sephardic and Mizrahi poetry and folk music an alveolar rhotic continues to be used.\n\nWhile most dialects of Arabic retain the classical pronunciation of as an alveolar trill or tap , a few dialects use a uvular trill . These include:\n\n\nThe uvular /r/ was attested already in vernacular Arabic of the Abbasid period. Nowadays Christian Arabic of Baghdad exhibits also an alveolar trill in very few lexemes, but primarily used in loanwords from Modern Standard Arabic. Native words with an alveolar trill are rare. Moreover, Mosul-Arabic has commonly the voiced alveolar trill in numbers instead of a uvular fricative (e.g. arbaʕiːn \"forty\"). Although this guttural rhotic is rare in Arabic, uvular and velar sounds are common in this language. The uvular/velar fricative ~ is a common standard pronunciation of the letter ', and the uvular plosive is a standard pronunciation of the letter ' .\n\nIn Amharic the alveolar trill is the usual pronunciation of /r/. But there are also assertions that around Addis Abeba some dialects exhibit a uvular r. Note that this information is not very supported in Semitic Studies. Also in Gafat (extinct since the 1950s) a uvular fricative or trill might have existed.\n\nThe majority of assyriologists deem an alveolar trill or tap the most likely pronunciation. However, there are several indications to a velar or uvular fricative ~ particularly supported by John Huehnergard. The main arguments constitute alternations with the voiceless uvular fricative /ḫ/ (e.g. \"ruššû/ḫuššû\" \"red\"; \"barmātu\" \"multicolored\" (fem. pl.), the spelling \"ba-aḫ-ma-a-tù\" is attested). Besides /r/ shows certain phonological parallelisms with /ḫ/ and other gutturals (especially the glottal stop ).\n\nGuttural R exist among several Malay dialects. While standard Malay commonly uses coronal r (,), the guttural fricative (~) are more prominently used in many dialects in Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia as well as some parts in Sumatra and East Kalimantan. These dialects include:\n\n\n~ Perak Malay and Kedah Malay are the most notable.\n\nThese dialects mainly uses guttural fricative (~) on both /r/ and /gh/. Standard Malay includes both coronal r (,) and voiced guttural fricative /gh/ (~) as two different phonemes. To denotes the guttural r in the dialects, letter \"r\" often replaced by \"gh\" or \"q\" in informal writings . Standard Malay words with voiced velar fricative (), such as \"loghat\" (dialect) and \"ghaib\" (invisible, mystical) are mostly Arabic loanwords spelled with letter غ.\n\nOther Austronesian languages with similar features are:\n\n\nStandard Basque uses a trill for (written as \"r-\", \"-rr-\", \"-r\"), but most speakers of the Lapurdian and Low Navarrese dialects use a voiced uvular fricative as in French. In the Southern Basque Country, the uvular articulation is seen as a speech defect, but the prevalence is higher among bilinguals than among Spanish monolinguals. Recently, young speakers of Lapurdian and Low Navarrese are uvularizing the tap (\"-r-\") as well, thus neutralizing both rhotics.\n\nWhereas standard Khmer uses an alveolar trill for , the colloquial Phnom Penh dialect uses a uvular pronunciation for the phoneme, which may be elided and leave behind a residual tonal or register contrast.\n\nSesotho originally used an alveolar trill , which has shifted to uvular in modern times.\n\nThere are languages where certain indigenous guttural consonants came to be written with means used in other languages to represent rhotics, thereby giving the superficial appearance of a guttural R that may have never actually functioned as a true rhotic consonant.\n\nThe Inuit languages Greenlandic and Inuktitut either orthographize or transliterate their voiced uvular obstruent as . In Greenlandic, this phoneme is , while in Inuktitut it is . This spelling was convenient because these languages do not have non-lateral liquid consonants, and guttural realizations of are common in various languages, particularly the colonial languages Danish and French. But the Alaskan Inupiat language writes its phoneme instead as , reserving for its retroflex phoneme, which Greenlandic and Inuktitut do not have.\n\n\n\n"}

He is the recipient of the 2013 National Book Award for fiction for his novel \"The Good Lord Bird\".\n\nMcBride's father, Rev. Andrew D. McBride (August 8, 1911 – April 5, 1957) was African-American; he died of cancer at the age of 45. His mother, Ruchel Dwajra Zylska (name later changed to Rachel Deborah Shilsky, and later changed again to Ruth McBride Jordan; April 1, 1921 – January 9, 2010), was a Jewish immigrant from Poland. James was raised in Brooklyn's Red Hook housing projects and was the last child Ruth had from her first marriage, the last child of Rev. Andrew McBride, and the eighth of 12 children.\n\nMcBride states:\nHis memoir, \"The Color of Water: A Black Man's Tribute to His White Mother\" (1995), describes his family history and his relationship with his mother.\n\nTwo of his older brothers, Dennis and Billy, graduated with doctorates in medicine, but that did not appeal to James McBride. He earned an undergraduate degree in music composition from Oberlin College in 1979, after which he earned a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University.\n\nAs a journalist, McBride worked on the staffs of many well-known publications, including \"The Boston Globe\", \"The Washington Post\", the \"Wilmington News Journal\", and \"People\" magazine. Additionally, he has written pieces for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, \"Us\" magazine, the \"Chicago Tribune\", \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\", \"Essence\" magazine, \"The New York Times\", and others. McBride is a charter member of the Clint Harding Network, a group of well-known journalists, writers, and musicians who periodically have appeared live on a Missouri radio program for the last two decades.\n\nMcBride is well known for his 1995 memoir, the bestselling book \"The Color of Water\", which describes his life growing up in a large, poor American-African family that was led by his white Jewish mother. McBride's mother was strict and the daughter of an Orthodox rabbi. During her first marriage to Rev. Andrew McBride, she converted to Christianity and became a devout Christian. The memoir spent over two years on \"The New York Times\" bestseller list, and has become an American classic. It is read in high schools and universities across America, has been translated into 16 languages, and sold more than 2.5 million copies.\n\nIn 2002, he published a novel, \"Miracle at St. Anna\", drawing on the history of the overwhelmingly African-American 92nd Infantry Division in the Italian campaign from mid-1944 to April 1945. The book was adapted into the movie \"Miracle at St. Anna\", directed by Spike Lee, released on September 26, 2008.\n\nIn 2005, McBride published the first volume of \"The Process\", a CD-based documentary about life as lived by low-profile jazz musicians.\n\nHis 2008 novel, \"Song Yet Sung\", is about an enslaved woman who has dreams about the future, and a wide array of freed black people, enslaved people, and whites whose lives come together in the odyssey that surrounds the last weeks of this woman's life. Harriet Tubman served as an inspiration for the book, and it provides a fictional depiction of a code of communication that enslaved people used to help runaways attain freedom. The book, based on real-life events that occurred on Maryland's Eastern Shore, also featured the notorious criminal Patty Cannon as a villain.\n\nIn 2012, McBride co-wrote and co-produced \"Red Hook Summer\" (2012) with Spike Lee.\n\nIn July 2013, McBride co-authored \"Hard Listening\" (2013) with the rest of the Rock Bottom Remainders (published by Coliloquy).\n\nIn August 2013, \"The Good Lord Bird\", a comedy novel, was released by Riverhead Books. The work details the life of notorious abolitionist John Brown. For this book, McBride won the 2013 National Book Award for fiction.\n\nOn September 22, 2016, President Barack Obama awarded McBride the 2015 National Humanities Medal \"for humanizing the complexities of discussing race in America. Through writings about his own uniquely American story, and his works of fiction informed by our shared history, his moving stories of love display the character of the American family.\"\n\nMcBride is the tenor saxophonist for the Rock Bottom Remainders, a group of best-selling authors who are lousy musicians. \"Hopefully,\" McBride says, \"the group has retired for good.\" He also toured as a saxophonist with jazz legend Little Jimmy Scott and has his own band that plays an eclectic blend of music.\n\nHe has written songs for Anita Baker, Grover Washington Jr., Pura Fé, and Gary Burton. McBride composed the theme music for the Clint Harding Network, Jonathan Demme's New Orleans documentary \"Right to Return\", and the Off-Broadway musical \"Bobos\", written by playwright Ed Shockley.\n\nMcBride was awarded the American Music Festival's Stephen Sondheim Award in 1993, the American Arts and Letters Richard Rodgers Award in 1996, and the inaugural ASCAP Richard Rodgers Horizons Award in 1996.\n\nMcBride is currently a Distinguished Writer-in-Residence at New York University.

{"id": "311973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=311973", "title": "Kairos", "text": "Kairos\n\nKairos () is an Ancient Greek word meaning the right, critical, or opportune moment. The ancient Greeks had two words for time: chronos () and kairos. The former refers to chronological or sequential time, while the latter signifies a proper or opportune time for action. While chronos is quantitative, kairos has a qualitative, permanent nature. \"Kairos\" also means \"weather\" in Modern Greek. The plural, καιροί (\"kairoi\" (Ancient and Modern Greek)) means \"the times\". Kairos is a term, idea, and practice that has been applied in several fields including classical rhetoric, modern rhetoric, digital media, Christian theology, and science.\n\nIn Onians' 1951 etymological studies of the word, he traces the primary root back to the ancient Greek association with both archery and weaving. In archery, kairos denotes the moment in which an arrow may be fired with sufficient force to penetrate a target. In weaving, kairos denotes the moment in which the shuttle could be passed through threads on the loom.\n\nIn the literature of the classical period, writers and orators used kairos to specify moments when the opportune action was made, often through metaphors involving archery and one’s ability to aim and fire at the exact right time on-target. For example, in The Suppliants, a drama written by Euripides, Adrastus describes the ability to influence and change another person’s mind by “aiming their bow beyond the kairos.”\n\nKairos is also an alternate spelling of the minor Greek deity Caerus, the god of luck and opportunity.\n\nIn rhetoric, \"kairos\" is \"a passing instant when an opening appears which must be driven through with force if success is to be achieved.\"\n\nKairos was central to the Sophists, who stressed the rhetor's ability to adapt to and take advantage of changing, contingent circumstances. In \"Panathenaicus\", Isocrates writes that educated people are those “who manage well the circumstances which they encounter day by day, and who possess a judgment which is accurate in meeting occasions as they arise and rarely misses the expedient course of action\".\n\nKairos is also very important in Aristotle's scheme of rhetoric. Kairos is, for Aristotle, the time and space context in which the proof will be delivered. Kairos stands alongside other contextual elements of rhetoric: \"The Audience\", which is the psychological and emotional makeup of those who will receive the proof; and \"To Prepon\", which is the style with which the orator clothes the proof.\n\nIn Ancient Greece, \"kairos\" was utilized by both of the two main schools of thought in the field of rhetoric. The competing schools were that of the Sophists, and that of their opposition, led by individuals such as Aristotle and Plato. Sophism approached rhetoric as an art form. Members of the school would travel around Greece teaching citizens about the art of rhetoric and successful discourse. In his article \"Toward a Sophistic Definition of Rhetoric\", John Poulakos defines rhetoric from a Sophistic perspective as follows: \"Rhetoric is the art which seeks to capture in opportune moments that which is appropriate and attempts to suggest that which is possible.\" Aristotle and Plato, on the other hand, viewed Sophistic rhetoric as a tool used to manipulate others, and criticized those who taught it. \nKairos fits into the Sophistic scheme of rhetoric in conjunction with the ideas of prepon and dynaton. These two terms combined with kairos are their keys to successful rhetoric. As stated by Poulakos, Prepon deals with the notion that \"what is said must conform to both audience and occasion.\" Dynaton has to do with the idea of the possible, or what the speaker is attempting to convince the audience of. Kairos in the Sophistic context is based on the thought that speech must happen at a certain time in order for it to be most effective. If rhetoric is to be meaningful and successful, it must be presented at the right moment, or else it will not have the same impact on the members of the audience. \nAristotle and his followers also discuss the importance of kairos in their teachings. In his \"Rhetoric\", one of the ways that Aristotle uses the idea of kairos is in reference to the specificity of each rhetorical situation. Aristotle believed that each rhetorical situation was different, and therefore different rhetorical devices needed to be applied at that point in time. One of the most well known parts of Aristotle's \"Rhetoric\" is when he discusses the roles of pathos, ethos, and logos. Aristotle ties kairos to these concepts, claiming that there are times in each rhetorical situation when one needs to be utilized over the others.\n\nKairos has classically been defined as a concept that focused on \"'the uniquely timely, the spontaneous, the radically particular.'\" Ancient Pythagoreans thought Kairos to be one of the most fundamental laws of the universe. Kairos was said to piece together the dualistic ways of the entire universe. Empedocles was the philosopher who connect kairos to the principle of opposites and harmony. It then became the principle of conflict and resolution and was thus inserted as a concept for rhetoric.\n\nIn his article \"Critical-Rhetorical Ethnography: Rethinking the Place and Process of Rhetoric,\" Aaron Hess submits a definition of kairos for the present day that bridges the two classical applications. Hess addresses Poulakos’s view that, “In short, kairos dictates that what is said must be said at the right time.” He also suggests that in addition to timeliness kairos considers appropriateness. According to Hess, kairos can either be understood as, \"the decorum or propriety of any given moment and speech act, implying a reliance on the given or known\" or as, \"the opportune, spontaneous, or timely.\" Although these two ideas of kairos might seem conflicting, Hess says that they offer a more extensive understanding of the term. Furthermore, they encourage creativity, which is necessary to adapt to unforeseen obstacles and opinions that can alter the opportune or appropriate moment, i.e. kairos. Being able to recognize the propriety of a situation while having the ability to adapt one’s rhetoric allows taking advantage of kairos to be successful. Hess’s updated definition of kairos concludes that along with taking advantage of the timeliness and appropriateness of a situation, the term also implies being knowledgeable of and involved in the environment where the situation is taking place in order to benefit fully from seizing the opportune moment.\nHess's conflicting perspective on kairos is exemplified by the disagreement between Lloyd F. Bitzer and Richard E. Vatz about the rhetorical situation. Bitzer argues that rhetorical situations exist independent of human perspective; a situation invites discourse. He discusses the feeling of a missed opportunity to speak (kairos) and the tendency to later create a speech in response to that unseized moment. However, Vatz counters Bitzer's view by claiming that a situation is made rhetorical by the perception of its interpreter and the way which they choose to respond to it, whether with discourse or not. It is the rhetor's responsibility to give an event meaning through linguistic depiction. Bitzer's and Vatz's perspectives add depth to Hess's ideas that kairos is concerned with both timeliness and appropriateness. On one hand, Bitzer's argument supports Hess's claim that kairos is spontaneous, and one must be able to recognize the situation as opportune in order to take advantage of it. On the other hand, Vatz's idea that the rhetor is responsible reinforces Hess's suggestion of the need to be knowledgeable and involved in the surrounding environment in order to fully profit from the situation.\n\nAccording to Bitzer, Kairos is composed of exigence, audience, and constraints. Exigence is the inherent pressure to do something about a situation immediately, with the action required depending on the situation. The audience are the listeners who the rhetor is attempting to persuade. Constraints are the external factors that challenges the rhetors ability to influence, such as the audience’s personal beliefs and motivations.\n\nAdditionally, factors such as cultural background, previous social experiences, and current mood, can influence the capacity to see and understand the correct and opportune moment of action.\n\nThus, the difficulty of using kairos in a modern rhetorical setting is understanding and working within its constraints, while also carefully considering unexpected situations and encounters that arise, in order to present one’s rhetorical argument as naturally as possible.\n\n'Kairos' modern English definition is vague. There is no one word in today's English language that completely encompasses the definition of kairos, similar to that of Ethos, Logos, and Pathos. In his article \"The Ethics of Argument: Rereading Kairos and Making Sense in a Timely Fashion,\" Michael Harker says, \"Like the 'points' on the rhetorical triangle, the meaning of kairos is not definitive but rather a starting point for grasping the whole of an argument.\" Kairos' inclusion in modern composition has not been implicitly made, but there are undertones. Various components of kairos are included in modern composition and have made profound effects on modern composition theory.'\n\nKairos' purpose in modern rhetoric is mostly focused on the placement of logos, pathos, and ethos. Kairos is used as a \"starting point\" in modern rhetoric. Kelly Pender's article \"'Kairos' and the Subject of Expressive Discourse\" states the inclusion of kairos within discourse \"would try to shift the focus of personal writing from the writer's experiences and emotions to a broader perspective that explicitly concentrates on the rhetorical situation...\" Kairos is an expressive inclusion within the overall subject of discourse, and one that has an effect on the entire rhetoric.\n\nIn the New Testament, \"kairos\" means \"the appointed time in the purpose of God,\" the time when God acts (e.g. : the \"kairos\" is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand). \"Kairos\" (used 86 times in the New Testament) refers to an opportune time, a \"moment\" or a \"season\" such as \"harvest time,\" whereas \"chronos\" (used 54 times) refers to a specific amount of time, such as a day or an hour (e.g. and ). Jesus makes a distinction in between \"His\" time and \"His brothers'\" time: paradoxically, it is \"always\" () his brothers' time. In the context, they can go to Jerusalem any time they wish.\n\nIn the Eastern Orthodox and Eastern Catholic churches, before the Divine Liturgy begins, the Deacon exclaims to the Priest, 'Καιρὸς τοῦ ποιῆσαι τῷ Κυρίῳ' (\"Kairos tou poiēsai tō Kyriō\"), i.e. \"It is time [\"kairos\"] for the Lord to act\", indicating that the time of the Liturgy is an intersection with Eternity.\n\nIn \"The Interpretation of History,\" neo-orthodox Lutheran theologian Paul Tillich made prominent use of the term. For him, the \"kairoi\" are those crises in history (see Christian existentialism) which create an opportunity for, and indeed demand, an existential decision by the human subject - the coming of Christ being the prime example (compare Karl Barth's use of \"Geschichte\" as opposed to \"Historie\"). In the Kairos Document, an example of liberation theology in South Africa under apartheid, the term \"kairos\" is used to denote \"the appointed time,\" \"the crucial time\" into which the document or text is spoken.\n\nIn Hippocrates’ (460-357 B.C.E) major theoretical treatises on the nature of medical science and methodology, the term “kairos” is used within the first line. Hippocrates is generally accepted as the father of medicine, but his contribution to the discourse of science is less discussed. While “kairos” most often refers to “the right time,” Hippocrates also used to term when referencing experimentation. Using this term allowed him to “express the variable components of medical practice more accurately.” Here the word refers more to proportion, the mean, and the implicit sense of right measure.\n\nHippocrates most famous quote about kairos is “every kairos is a chronos, but not every chronos is a kairos.” \n\nIn \"A Rhetoric of Doing: Essays on Written Discourse in Honor of James L. Kinneavy\" by Stephen Paul Witte, Neil Nakadate, Roger Dennis Cherry also discusses the art of kairos in the field of science. Citing John Swales, the essay notes that the introduction sections of scientific research articles are nothing more than the construction of openings. This idea derives from the spacial aspect of kairos, or the creation of \"an opening,\" which can be created by writers and discovered by readers. This opening is the opportune time, or kairos. Swales created what he called the \"create a research space\" model, wherein kairos, or an opening, was constructed. It consisted of four rhetorical moves. 1.) establishing the field. 2.) summarizing previous research. 3.) preparing for present research, and 4.) introducing the present research. The third step is one where a gap in previous research is indicated, thus creating the need for more information. The writer constructs a need, and an opening. Because kairos emphasizes change, it is an important aspect of science. Not all scientific research can be presented at the same time or in the same way, but creating an opening makes it possible to construct the right time.\n\nThis can easily be related back to Hippocrates statement that not every opening is an opportunity. Yet, in science, the message can be adapted in such a way that chronos becomes kairos.\n\nThe idea can also be expressed in the words of Carolyn M. Glasshoff who wrote that, specifically in the field of scientific writing, “any text must be influenced by the kairos that exists both before the text is created and during the presentation. In addition, each text helps create a new kairos for texts that come after.” \nThe historical context of the definition of kairos may make the concept appear outdated. However, the relevancy of kairos is at its peak as the world has rapidly transformed into a society dependent on digital technology. In order to recognize how kairos can be applied to online media and the challenges that occur as a result, a broad definition of the term is required. One definition makes the application of kairos to digital media easy to recognize, as it states kairos can be referred to as particular moment in which success is achieved when an opening is pursued with force. This definition prompts a main issue within the application of kairos to online content: if timing is crucial to the message of communication that is being received, how can we communicate effectively online, where anything can be published at any time?\n\nThe difficulty with modern rhetoric in the digital space is that the audience is less easily influenced by the rhetor. As such, it is difficult for rhetors to utilize kairos to the best of their abilities. Due to the nature of which modern audiences in the electronic age consume media, it is highly possible that they are multi-tasking, with their attention divided among multiple sources. This difficulty is compounded with the fact that this audience can consume discourse at different times, in different places, and through varying mediums. As a result, the audience is able to assign encountered discourse at various levels of personal priority. With this, they are able to discern which discourse they think is vital or interesting, and discard those they deem trivial or unworthy of their attention.\n\nThere are also multiple external factors that lead to the difficulty in using kairos in a modern setting. Since computer hardware, software, and even the underlying operating system all differ between people, it is difficult for the orator to take account for every permutation possible. Couple this with the lack of a true shared community online, since such virtual “cloakroom communities” are only temporary, and the difficulties in using kairos in the digital age becomes painfully clear.\n\nSome scholars studying kairos in the modern digital sphere argue that the aspects of body/ identity, distribution/ circulation, access/ accessibility, interaction, and economics are handled differently in an online setting and therefore messages that are sent digitally need to be altered to fit the new circumstances. In order to reach online audiences effectively, scholars suggest that context of the information's use, which includes considerations of legal, health-related, disciplinary, and political factors paired with smart rhetorical thinking can solve the issue of miscommunicated messages distributed on online forums.\n\n"}

On its face side, the fibula shows an unidentified saint with a halo. It was found in a woman's grave of the beginning of the Christianization of northern Germany, and is in the permanent exhibition of the Archaeological Museum Hamburg in Harburg, Hamburg.\n\nThe cemetery was located on the western fringes of the ', an approximately mountain range which is running out on the ' some southeast of the village center of Maschen. During sand extraction from the Fuchsberg for the construction of the nearby Bundesautobahn 1, two Bronze Age tumuli were discovered in 1958. \n\nThe following excavations revealed that both grave mounds were disturbed to the undisturbed ground. Except for a few ceramic vessel shards and a razor from several later burials on the hill, no further findings were recorded. While pushing off the humuslayer north of the tumuli, the first late Saxon flat graves appeared in the ground. Additionally some soil discolorations appeared at a brim of the sand mine some east, indicating burial pits. During the initially launched rescue excavation, the complete burial site were excavated and documented in a three-week operation. It was the first fully documented late Saxon burial site of northern Germany so far with a total of 210 examined burials. \n\n21 burials were oriented in south-north direction and the majority of 189 burials were created in west-east orientation. The Maschen disc brooch was found in the grave No. 54 of a wealthy woman.\n\nThe Maschen disc brooch lay with its face side down on the woman's chest. The brooch has a diameter of and is made of different colored vitreous enamel in cloisonné technique on a copper plate. The copper base of the brooch is can shaped, and the enamel plate was fixed in the copper base on a bed of loam by flanging the protruding edges of the bases wall. The needle apparatus was not preserved. The remaining hinges indicate that it was a needle with a coil spring. Both the metal parts and enamel inlays are slightly worn.

The face and neck of the portrayed person are made of now greenish white enamel. Its eyes and nose region is formed by a curved bar made of copper, ending in two loops as stylized eyes. Around the head a kind of halo is shown, made of whitish to light blue enamel. The upper body has a semi-elliptical shape. The body is decorated by two widely arced copper bars from the neck towards the shoulders, which end there in small loops. The area around the neck of the figure is made of now light blue to turquoise enamel. The lower chest area, below the copper bars, is made of a now dark blue enamel.\n\nDue to its halo-like ornament around the head, the figure on the Maschen disc brooch is interpreted as an unspecified saint, and may possibly depict Jesus Christ. The addition of the fibula as a grave good indicates that the buried woman was an early Christian. She may have promised herself a salvation effect from the depicted figure, as the brooch was found placed with its face side on her chest. \n\nDue to the geographical orientation of the burial and its location within the cemetery, the burial has been dated to the period between 800 and 900 AD, which marks the beginning of the thorough Christianization of Northern Germany. \n\nSo far, some 100 comparison finds of fibulae of the Maschen disc brooch type were known, but they all came from stray finds or were collected from the surface without any assignment to a specific grave, and therefore a more precise dating of this type of brooches has been impossible before. \n\nBy the end of 2012 another nearly identical piece was found in a construction area at the Tostedt district of Todtglüsingen. The origin of this fibula is believed to be the Lower Rhine region and the noticeable accumulation of finds at the Niederelbe area may indicate that it has faced an increased popularity especially in this region.\n\n"}

{"id": "18404712", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18404712", "title": "Nationalism studies", "text": "Nationalism studies\n\nNationalism studies is an interdisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of nationalism and related issues. While nationalism has been the subject of scholarly discussion since at least the late eighteenth century, it is only since the early 1990s that it has received enough attention for a distinct field to emerge.\n\nAuthors such as Eric Hobsbawm, Carlton J. H. Hayes, Hans Kohn, Elie Kedourie, John Hutchinson, Ernest Gellner, Karl Deutsch, Walker Connor, Anthony D. Smith, and Benedict Anderson laid the foundation for nationalism studies in the post-war period. In the early 1990s their ideas were enthusiastically taken up by academics, journalists, and others looking to understand and explain the apparent resurgence of nationalism marked by events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Rwanda genocide, and the Yugoslav Wars.\n\nThe development of the field can be divided into four stages: (I) the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when nationalism first emerged, and most interest in it was philosophical; (II) the period from the First World War until the end of the Second, when nationalism became a subject of formal academic inquiry; (III) the post-war period from 1945 to the late 1980s, when several sociologists and political scientists developed general theories of nationalism in the context of worldwide decolonisation and the 'ethnic revival' in the West; and (IV) the period following the fall of communism in 1989, which led to a surge of interest in nationalism and the crystallisation of nationalism studies as a field.\n\n\"Up to the First World War,\" Umut Özkirimli explains, \"interest in nationalism was largely ethical and philosophical. The scholars of this period, predominantly historians and social philosophers, were more concerned with the 'merits and defects' of the doctrine than with the origins and spread of national phenomena.\" The nation-state was seen as a progressive stage in the historical development of human societies, and both liberals and Marxists expected that nationalism would eventually give way to a cosmopolitan world order. In this context, nations and nationalism were taken for granted, and most authors who discussed them were motivated by some political concern. There were no attempts to fashion a general theory of nationalism that was applicable to all cases. Some of the important authors in this period include: Johann Gottfried Herder, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Giuseppe Mazzini, Ernest Renan, and John Stuart Mill.\n\nSeveral universities organize degree and non-degree courses on nationalism. Boston University, University of London (particularly the London School of Economics), Central European University (Hungary), and University of Edinburgh are among the most prominent institutions where the study of nationalism occupies a central place. The Faculty of Humanities of Eötvös Loránd University (Hungary) has recently launched a comprehensive short-term program, dedicated exclusively to the study of nationalism.\n\nAuthors such as Michal Luczewski and Ruhtan Yalçıne believe that the field is becoming increasingly difficult to study. According to Michal Luczewski, researchers have been talking past each other for decades and there has not been valuable knowledge produced for around 50 years. Since this time, the field has been stuck between contemporary scientific facts and common-sense theories. Answers to the basic questions of nationalism (What is the Nation? Why does the Nation exist?) have been answered countless times over leaving a swath of contradictory theories and a lack of consensus. The question remains whether it is even possible to construct a universal theory of nationalism. Theories previously proposed are often detached from reality, given the diverse ways in which identities form in different groups around the world .\n\nIn order to solve for this problem Michal Luczewski recommends that scholars employ greater awareness in addressing the essential questions of nationalism studies. Scholars should produce extensive work dealing “with national phenomena in all their varieties, integrating emotions, cognitions, both the subjective and objective dimensions into one picture.” It is essential for scholars to ignore subjective experience and deal directly with reality. This can be accomplished by utilizing empirical evidence. Luczewski also recommends starting small, “consecutively from the micro level through more and more general steps to the macro one.”\n\nOne of the earliest journals devoted to the study of nationalism was the \"Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism\", founded at the University of Prince Edward Island by Thomas Spira in 1973. The journal \"Nationalities Papers\" was founded in 1971. Journals in the field include the following:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Doeg tribe, then located in present-day Northern Virginia, are also thought to have spoken a form of the same language. These dialects were intermediate between the Native American groups of Lenape languages formerly spoken to the north of this area (in present-day Delaware and New Jersey) and the Powhatan language, formerly spoken to the south, in what is now Tidewater Virginia.\n\nPiscataway is classified as an Eastern Algonquian language:\n\n\nThe Piscataway dialect, an individual from the Eastern Algonquian family, is extinct. According to \"The Languages of Native North America,\" Piscataway, otherwise called Conoy (from the Iroquois name for the tribe), was a dialect of Nanticoke.

It is identified with the gathering of Delaware dialects, and all the more nearly to Powhatan, which were formerly spoken in the area of present-day Virginia. The first speakers lived on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay, today part of Maryland. In particular, they occupied the range of the lower Potomac and Patuxent River seepages.\n\nThe Piscataway dialect was a piece of the huge Algonquian dialect family.

The Great Parterre of Schönbrunn Garden is lined on both sides with 32 over life-size sculptures that represent mythological deities and virtues. The \"Neptune Fountain\" at the foot of the Gloriette hill is the crowning monument of the Great Parterre. Other sculptures are distributed throughout the garden and palace forecourt, including fountains and pools. Several sculptors were employed during the execution of these works, among them Johann Baptist Hagenauer.\n\nThe \"Neptune Fountain\" at the foot of the Gloriette hill was designed to be the crowning monument of the Great Parterre. Commissioned by Empress Maria Theresa, work on the fountain began in 1776 and was completed within four years, just prior to the death of the empress. The overall design was done by Johann Ferdinand Hetzendorf von Hohenberg; the marble sculptural group was executed by Wilhelm Beyer.\n\nThe retaining wall of the \"Neptune Fountain\" merges into the slope of the Gloriette hill and includes a balustrade adorned with ornate vases. From a projecting semi-oval plinth, a rocky formation emerges with the sea-god Neptune and his entourage. The plinth is segmented by panels decorated with masks and separated and embellished with garlands. Neptune stands atop the grotto at the center of the figure group in a shell-shaped chariot holding a trident. A nymph is seated to his left. The sea-goddess Thetis kneels to his right, asking the sea god to favor her son Achilles on his voyage to Troy.\n\nAppearing at the base of the grotto are four tritons—creatures who are half-man and half-fish—who are part of the sea-god's entourage. Each holds a conch shell trumpet with which they can inspire fear. They are restraining the sea-horses who draw Neptune's chariot across the seas. This image of Neptune commanding the watery dominion was a common symbol in sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth-century art, to represent monarchs controlling the fate of their people. In the nineteenth century, a bank of evergreen trees was planted behind the white figural group to provide a dark contrast.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The 8,000 congress members conclude the event with the formulation of 46 vows.\n\nTo commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Congress of 1912, the Société du parler français organized a second congress in Quebec City between June 27 and July 1, 1937. \n\nThis second congress used the same formula as that of the first congress, with the exception that it was not planned to coincide with the festivities of the French-Canadian National Day, but rather shortly after. The theme of the second congress was: \"The French spirit in Canada, in our language, our laws, our habits\" (\"L'esprit français au Canada, dans notre langue, dans nos lois, dans nos mœurs\").\n\nThe organizing committee of the Congress, set up by the Société du parler français on May 8, 1936, was presided by Mgr Camille Roy, president of the Society and rector of Université Laval. It is also Camille Roy who presided the executive office of the organizing committee. The executive office set up committees on finance, propaganda, reception, and religious ceremony as well as various sub-committees. \n\nAn honorary committee was instituted to add to the prestige of the event. The members of this committee were the most visible State and Church officials of Quebec: the archbishop of Quebec Jean-Marie-Rodrigue Villeneuve as patron of the Congress; the Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Ésioff-Léon Patenaude as honorary president; the premier of Quebec Maurice Duplessis, the federal minister of justice Ernest Lapointe and the mayor of Quebec Joseph-Ernest Grégoire as honorary vice-presidents.\n\nThe Académie française delegated the novelist and essayist Louis Bertrand to the event.\n\nIn virtue of article III of the rules of the Congress, were invited to participate all \"French Canadians, Acadians and Franco-Americans\" and their various institutions, admitted as either protective members, beneficiary members, donating members, or fellow members. \"Foreign persons or corporations\" could also adhere to the Congress with the title of observer. Delegates from Haïti were in fact present to the event.\n\nUpon registering, congress members received a membership card granting room access, a copy of the programme and the ribbon of the Congress. It was also possible to buy a button of the Congress for 10 cents and a badge medal (the work of Marius Plamondon) for 75 cents.\n\nThe sessions of the Congress were held at the Colisée de Québec, in several buildings of Université Laval, at the Palais de Justice de Québec and the Palais Montcalm.\n\nThe programme of the Congress of 1937 closely resembled that of 1912, but was more sophisticated. Contained within a general programme of six days, from Sunday June 27 to Friday July 2, which included masses, breakfasts, receptions, banquets and concerts, tours, there was a programme of six public sessions, two general assemblies, 23 sessions by the four study sections, and diverse special programmes (children day, ladies day, youth day).\n\nThe Second Congress of the French Language in Canada concluded with the adoption of 46 vows. \n\nThe seven vows of the language section expressed the desire of congress members to see that the phonetic and elocution of the students' speech improve by their methodical teaching and by the particular care which teachers must give to their own diction; that a program of studies on the spoken language of Franco-Americans be set up; that a greater number of local and regional history societies be founded; that libraries be more numerous and more furnished; that the language of advertising improve and be in proper French; that scientific reviews be better supported and encouraged; that a Board on the French language in Canada (\"Office de la langue française au Canada\") be set up, with the mandate to examine and correct commercial signs, posters, and brochures.\n\nThe three vows of the arts section pertained to the promotion of art appreciation among workers by conferences, projections, etc.; that the culture of letters be developed, especially by encouraging \"our own writers\"; that the teaching of drawing be developed in schools.\n\nThe five wishes of the section on laws dealt with the conservation of the French spirit of laws and interpretation methods; that a commission be set up to revise all laws of Quebec to conform to the French spirit, in a concise, logical and methodical redaction; that the translation of federal laws (which were all in English) improve and that translations \"no longer be restrained to literal translation\"; that the rights of the French language be recognized in all of Canada and that the rights of francophone minorities to preserve their language by learning it in school be recognized in all of North America;\n\nThe other vows (from the 16th to 46th) were formulated by the section on habits and pertained to the promotion of professional associations, parish schools in the United States, the quality of French in the press and radio, solidarity among francophone groups, the organization of a Congress on Economics, the creation of a linguistic information office (terminology, translation), that Canada and Haïti establish press relations to better know each other, as well as items dear to the catholic clergy: fighting communism and discouraging marriage between Catholics and Protestants. \n\nThe participants to the ladies session wished that taste for poetry be cultivated among the young people, that French-language feminine associations be created in Canada and the United States, that the education of women be modernized, that children literature be developed, etc. The participants to the youth session wished that libraries contain books appropriate to young age and also that youth movements develop.\n\nOn the first of July, the Permanent Committee of the Congresses on the French Language in Canada (\"Comité permanent des Congrès de la langue française en Amérique\"), which was inactive since 1920, was reactivated. It was composed of 20 members responsible to publish the account of the Congress's sittings and to see that the vows it has formulated become reality.

{"id": "133996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=133996", "title": "Transit (satellite)", "text": "Transit (satellite)\n\nThe Transit system, also known as NAVSAT or NNSS (for \"Navy Navigation Satellite System\"), was the first satellite navigation system to be used operationally. The system was primarily used by the U.S. Navy to provide accurate location information to its Polaris ballistic missile submarines, and it was also used as a navigation system by the Navy's surface ships, as well as for hydrographic survey and geodetic surveying. Transit provided continuous navigation satellite service from 1964, initially for Polaris submarines and later for civilian use as well.\n\nThe Transit satellite system, sponsored by the Navy and developed jointly by DARPA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kirschner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite-based geopositioning system. Just days after the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1, the first man-made earth-orbiting satellite on October 4, 1957, two physicists at APL, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, found themselves in discussion about the radio signals that would likely be emanating from the satellite. They were able to determine Sputnik's orbit by analyzing the Doppler shift of its radio signals during a single pass. Discussing the way forward for their research, their director Frank McClure, the chairman of APL's Research Center, suggested in March 1958 that if the satellite's position were known and predictable, the Doppler shift could be used to locate a receiver on Earth, and proposed a satellite system to implement this principle.\n\nDevelopment of the Transit system began in 1958, and a prototype satellite, Transit 1A, was launched in September 1959. That satellite failed to reach orbit. A second satellite, Transit 1B, was successfully launched April 13, 1960, by a Thor-Ablestar rocket. The first successful tests of the system were made in 1960, and the system entered Naval service in 1964.\n\nThe Chance Vought/LTV Scout rocket was selected as the dedicated launch vehicle for the program because it delivered a payload into orbit for the lowest cost per pound. However, the Scout decision imposed two design constraints. First, the weight of the earlier satellites was about 300 lb each, but the Scout launch capacity to the Transit orbit was about 120 lb (it was later increased significantly). A satellite mass reduction had to be achieved, despite a demand for more power than APL had previously designed into a satellite. The second problem concerned the increased vibration that affected the payload during launching because the Scout used solid rocket motors. Thus, electronic equipment that was smaller than before and rugged enough to withstand the increased vibration of launch had to be produced.\nMeeting the new demands was more difficult than expected, but it was accomplished. The first prototype operational satellite (Transit 5A-1) was launched into a polar orbit by a Scout rocket on 18 December 1962.\nThe satellite verified a new technique for deploying the solar panels and for separating from the rocket, but otherwise it was not successful because of trouble with the power system. Transit 5A-2, launched on 5 April 1963, failed to achieve orbit. Transit 5A-3, with a redesigned power supply, was launched on 15 June 1963. A malfunction of the memory occurred during powered flight that kept it from accepting and storing the navigation message, and the oscillator stability was degraded during launch. Thus, 5A-3 could not be used for navigation. However, this satellite was the first to achieve gravity-gradient stabilization, and its other subsystems performed well.\n\nSurveyors used Transit to locate remote benchmarks by averaging dozens of Transit fixes, producing sub-meter accuracy. In fact, the elevation of Mount Everest was corrected in the late 1980s by using a Transit receiver to re-survey a nearby benchmark.\n\nThousands of warships, freighters and private watercraft used Transit from 1967 until 1991. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union started launching their own satellite navigation system \"Parus\" (military) / Tsikada (civilian), which is still in use today besides the next generation GLONASS. Some Soviet warships were equipped with Motorola NavSat receivers.\n\nThe Transit system was made obsolete by the Global Positioning System (GPS), and ceased navigation service in 1996. Improvements in electronics allowed GPS receivers to effectively take several fixes at once, greatly reducing the complexity of deducing a position. GPS uses many more satellites than were used with Transit, allowing the system to be used continuously, while Transit provided a fix only every hour or more.\n\nAfter 1996, the satellites were kept in use for the Navy Ionospheric Monitoring System (NIMS).\n\nThe satellites (known as OSCAR or NOVA satellites) used in the system were placed in low polar orbits, at an altitude of about 600 nautical miles (1,100 km), with an orbital period of about 106 minutes. A \"constellation\" of five satellites was required to provide reasonable global coverage. While the system was operational, at least ten satellites – one spare for each satellite in the basic constellation – were usually kept in orbit. Note that these \"OSCAR\" satellites were not the same as the OSCAR series of satellites that were devoted to use by amateur radio operators to use in satellite communications. \n\nThe orbits of the Transit satellites were chosen to cover the entire Earth; they crossed over the poles and were spread out at the equator. Since only one satellite was usually visible at any given time, fixes could be made only when one of the satellites was above the horizon. At the equator this delay between fixes was several hours; at mid-latitudes the delay decreased to an hour or two. For its intended role as an updating system for SLBM launch, Transit sufficed, since submarines took periodic fixes to reset their inertial guidance system, but Transit lacked the ability to provide high-speed, real-time position measurements.\n\nWith later improvements, the system provided single-pass accuracy of roughly 200 meters, and also provided time synchronization to roughly 50 microseconds. Transit satellites also broadcast encrypted messages, although this was a secondary function.\n\nThe Transit satellites used arrays of magnetic-core memory as mass data storage up to 32 kilobytes.\n\nThe basic operating principle of Transit is similar to the system used by emergency locator transmitters, except that in the latter case the transmitter is on the ground and the receiver is in orbit.\n\nEach Transit system satellite broadcast two UHF carrier signals that provided precise time hacks (every two minutes), plus the satellite's six orbital elements and orbit perturbation variables. The orbit ephemeris and clock corrections were uploaded twice each day to each satellite from one of the four Navy tracking and injection stations. This broadcast information allowed a ground receiver to calculate the location of the satellite at any point in time. Use of two carrier frequencies permitted ground receivers to reduce navigation errors caused by ionospheric refraction. The Transit system also provided the first worldwide timekeeping service, allowing clocks everywhere to be synchronised with 50 microsecond accuracy.\n\nThe Transit satellite broadcast on 150 and 400 MHz. The two frequencies were used to allow the refraction of the satellite radio signals by the ionosphere to be canceled out, thereby improving location accuracy.\n\nThe critical information that allowed the receiver to compute location was a unique frequency curve caused by the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect caused an apparent compression of the carrier's wavelength as the satellite approached the receiver, and stretching of wavelengths as the satellite receded. The spacecraft traveled at about 17,000 mph, which could increase or decrease the frequency of the received carrier signal by as much as 10 kHz. This Doppler curve was unique for each location within line-of-sight of the satellite. For instance, the earth's rotation caused the ground receiver to move toward or away from the satellite's orbit, creating a non-symmetric Doppler shift for approach and recession, allowing the receiver to determine whether it was east or west of the satellite's north-south ground track.\n\nCalculating the most likely receiver location was not a trivial exercise. The navigation software used the satellite's motion to compute a 'trial' Doppler curve, based on an initial 'trial' location for the receiver. The software would then perform a least squares curve fit for each two-minute section of the Doppler curve, recursively moving the trial position until the trial Doppler curve 'most closely' matched the actual Doppler received from the satellite for all two-minute curve segments.\n\nIf the receiver was also moving relative to the earth, such as aboard a ship or airplane, this would cause mismatches with the idealized Doppler curves, and degrade position accuracy. However, positional accuracy could usually be computed to within 100 meters for a slow-moving ship, even with reception of just one two-minute Doppler curve. This was the navigation criterion demanded by the U.S. Navy, since American submarines would normally expose their UHF antenna for only 2 minutes to obtain a usable Transit fix. The U.S. submarine version of the Transit system also included a special encrypted, more accurate version of the downloaded satellite's orbital data This enhanced data allowed for considerably enhanced system accuracy [not unlike Selective Availability (SA) under GPS]. Using this enhanced mode, accuracy was typically less than 20 meters, i.e. the accuracy was between that of LORAN C and GPS. Certainly, Transit was the most accurate navigation system of its day.\n\nA network of ground stations, whose locations were accurately known, continually tracked the Transit satellites. They measured the Doppler shift and transferred the data to 5-hole paper tape. This data was sent to the Satellite Control Center at Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland using commercial and military teleprinter networks. The data from the fixed ground stations provided the location information on the Transit satellite orbit. Locating a Transit satellite in earth orbit from a known ground station using the Doppler shift is simply the reverse of using the known location of the satellite in orbit to locate an unknown location on the earth, again using the Doppler shift .\n\nA typical ground station occupied a small Quonset hut. The accuracy of the ground station measurements was a function of the ground station master clock accuracy. Initially a quartz oscillator in a temperature controlled oven was used as the master clock. The master clock was checked daily for drift using a VLF receiver tuned to a US Navy VLF station. The VLF signal had the property that the phase of the VLF signal did not change from day to day at noon along the path between the transmitter and the receiver and thus could be used to measure oscillator drift. Later rubidium and cesium beam clocks were used. Ground stations had number names; for example, Station 019 was McMurdo Station, Antarctica. For many years during the 1970s this station was staffed by a graduate student and an undergraduate student, typically in electrical engineering, from the University of Texas at Austin. Other stations were located at New Mexico State University, the University of Texas at Austin, Sicily, Japan, Seychelles Island, Thule Greenland and a number of other locations. The Greenland and Antarctica stations saw every pass of every Transit satellite because of their near pole location for these polar orbiting satellites.\n\nA portable version of the ground station was called a Geoceiver and was used to make field measurements. This receiver, power supply, punched tape unit, and antennas could fit in a number of padded aluminum cases and could be shipped as extra cargo on an airline. Data was taken over a period of time, typically a week, and sent back to the Satellite Control Center for processing. Therefore, unlike GPS, there was not an immediate accurate location of the Geoceiver location. A Geoceiver was permanently located at the South Pole Station and operated by United States Geological Survey personnel. Since it was located on the surface of a moving ice sheet, its data was used to measure the ice sheet movement. Other Geoceivers were taken out in the field in Antarctica during the summer and were used to measure locations, for example the movement of the Ross Ice Shelf.\n\nSince no computer small enough to fit through a submarine's hatch existed (in 1958), a new computer was designed, named the AN/UYK-1 (TRW-130). It was built with rounded corners to fit through the hatch and was about five feet tall and sealed to be waterproof. The principal design engineer was then-UCLA-faculty-member Lowell Amdahl, brother of Gene Amdahl. The AN/UYK-1 was built by the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation (later TRW) for the \"Lafayette\" class SSBNs. It was equipped with 8,192 words of 15-bit core memory plus parity bit, threaded by hand at their Canoga Park factory. Cycle time was about one microsecond. The AN/UYK-1 weighed about .\n\nThe AN/UYK-1 was a microprogrammed machine with a 15-bit word length that lacked hardware commands to subtract, multiply or divide, but could add, shift, form ones' complement, and test the carry bit. Instructions to perform standard fixed and floating point operations were software subroutines and programs were lists of links and operators to those subroutines. For example, the \"subtract\" subroutine had to form the ones' complement of the subtrahend and add it. Multiplication required successive shifting and conditional adding.\n\nIn the AN/UYK-1 instruction set, the machine-language instructions had two operators that could simultaneously manipulate the arithmetic registers—for example, complementing the contents of one register while loading or storing another. It may have been the first computer that implemented a single-cycle indirect addressing ability.\n\nDuring a satellite pass, a GE receiver would receive the orbital parameters and encrypted messages from the satellite, as well as measure the Doppler-shifted frequency at intervals and provide this data to the AN/UYK-1 computer. The computer would also receive from the ship's inertial navigation system (SINS) a reading of latitude and longitude. Using this information the AN/UYK-1 ran the least squares algorithm and provided a location reading in about fifteen minutes.\n\nThere were 37 other satellites in the Transit series that were assigned the Transit name by NASA.\n\nTransit 3B demonstrated uploading programs into the onboard computer's memory whilst in orbit.\n\nTransit 4A, launched June 29, 1961, was the first satellite to use a radioactive power source (RTG) (a SNAP-3). Transit 4B (1961) also had a SNAP-3 RTG. Transit 4B was among several satellites which were inadvertently damaged or destroyed in a nuclear explosion, specifically the United States Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test on July 9, 1962 and subsequent radiation belt.\n\nTransit 5A3 and Transit 5B-1 (1963) each had a SNAP-3 RTG.\n\nTransit 5B-2 (1963) had a SNAP-9A RTG.\n\nTransit-9 and 5B4 (1964) and Transit-5B7 and 5B6 (1965) each had \"a nuclear power source\".\n\nThe US Air Force also periodically launched short lived satellites equipped with radio beacons of 162 MHz and 324 MHz at much lower orbits to study orbital drag. The Transit ground tracking stations tracked these satellites as well, locating the satellites within their orbits using the same principles. The satellite location data was used to collect orbital drag data, including variations in the upper atmosphere and the Earth's gravitational field.\n\n"}

The concept gained more mainstream attention by late 2012 during the debates over the United States fiscal cliff negotiations and renewed debt-ceiling discussions. After reaching the headlines during the week of January 7, 2013, use of the trillion dollar coin concept was ultimately rejected by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury. Five days later, Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn announced that Senate Republicans would end their threat to block an increase in the debt ceiling.\n\nThe issuance of paper currency is subject to various accounting and quantity restrictions that platinum coinage is not. According to the United States Mint, coinage is accounted for as follows:\nSince Fiscal Year (FY) 1996, the Mint has operated under the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund (PEF). As authorized by Public Law 104-52 (codified at ), the PEF eliminates the need for appropriations. Proceeds from the sales of circulating coins to the Federal Reserve Banks (FRB), bullion coins to authorized purchasers, and numismatic items to the public and other customers are paid into the PEF and provide the funding for Mint operations. All circulating, bullion and numismatic operating expenses and capital investments incurred for the Mint's operations and programs are paid out of the PEF. By law, all funds in the PEF are available without fiscal year limitation. Revenues determined to be in excess of the amount required by the PEF are transferred to the United States Treasury General Fund as off-budget and on-budget receipts. Off-budget receipts consist of seigniorage, the difference between the receipts from the Federal Reserve System from the sale of circulating coins at face value and the full costs of minting and distributing circulating coins. Seigniorage is deposited periodically to the General Fund where it reduces the government's need to borrow.\n\nThe concept of striking a trillion dollar coin that would generate one trillion dollars in seigniorage, which would be off-budget, or numismatic profit, which would be on-budget, and be transferred to the Treasury, is based on the authority granted by Section of the United States Code for the Treasury Department to \"mint and issue platinum bullion coins\" in any denominations the Secretary of the Treasury may choose. Thus, if the Treasury were to mint one trillion dollar coins, it could deposit such coins at the Federal Reserve's Treasury account instead of issuing new debt.\n\n31 U.S.C. 5112(k) as originally enacted by Public Law 104-208 in 1996:\n\nThe Secretary may mint and issue bullion and proof platinum coins in accordance with such specifications, designs, varieties, quantities, denominations, and inscriptions as the Secretary, in the Secretary's discretion, may prescribe from time to time.\n\nIn 2000, the word \"bullion\" was replaced with \"platinum bullion coins\".\n\nPlatinum bullion coins can, by this statute, be minted in any denomination, whereas coins in any other specified metal are restricted to amounts of $50, $25, $10, $5 and $1. This is the origin of the concept of minting a very high denomination coin, since the platinum clause provides the only loophole.\n\nPhilip N. Diehl, former director of the United States Mint and with Republican Congressman Michael Castle co-author of the platinum coin law, has said the procedure would be permitted by the statute. However, Castle says he never intended such a use. The platinum coinage provision was eventually passed by a Republican Congress over the objections of a Democratic Treasury in 1996.\n\nLaurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard Law School, said the legal basis of the trillion dollar coin is sound and that the coin could not be challenged in court as no one would have standing to do so. Professor Jonathan H. Adler of the Case Western Reserve University School of Law has said that he believes the legality of the trillion dollar coin to be dubious.\n\nThe idea for the Treasury Department to mint a coin and send it to the Federal Reserve in order to pay off the debt was first popularized by Populist Presidential Candidate Bo Gritz in 1992. As a standard part of his stump speeches, he would hold up a five-inch example coin. The specific concept was first introduced by Carlos Mucha, a lawyer who commented under the name \"beowulf\" on various blogs. \"Beowulf\" outlined the idea in a series of comments on Warren Mosler's blog in May 2010, noting that \"Congress has already delegated to Tsy [Treasury] all the seinorage power authority it needs to mint a $1 trillion coin...\" Beowulf also drew attention to the concept on the blog of economist Brad Delong in July 2010 and in a legal analysis blogpost of his own in January 2011 but it wasn't until July 2011 that the use of the concept as an unorthodox method of resolving the debt-ceiling crisis came to the attention of the financial press and in mainstream media blogs. At that time the idea also found some support from legal academics such as Yale Law School's Jack Balkin. Once the debt ceiling crisis of the summer of 2011 was resolved, however, attention to the concept faded.\n\nThe concept gained renewed, and more mainstream, attention by late 2012 as the debt-ceiling limit was being approached once again. In early January the economist Paul Krugman endorsed the idea and asserted that opposition to the idea was coming from people unwilling to admit the truth that \"money is a social contrivance.\" His endorsement attracted considerable media attention. Former Mint director Diehl was widely cited in the media debunking criticisms of the coin and its basis in law. Congressman Jerry Nadler endorsed the idea and it was featured in the international press by January 4, 2013.\n\n\"Beowulf\" would later tell \"Wired\" magazine that the coin idea came from a December 2009 \"Wall Street Journal\" article that talked about how several people were able to generate frequent-flyer miles at no cost by ordering coins from the U.S. Mint with a credit card offering mileage rewards and then depositing the coins at a bank to pay off the credit card debt. He also said that he was inspired by a 2008 book, \"Web of Debt\", by Ellen Brown, which quoted a former Treasury official who said the government could order the printing of large coins to pay off the national debt. \"Beowulf\" said the trillion dollar coin idea is more rightly attributed to a small discussion group than to an individual, adding that the group was \"just in it for the lulz\" (for personal amusement).\n\nSome commentators have argued that although the concept may be strictly legal, it would weaken the checks and balances system of U.S. government even if the spending that the minting of the coin would allow has already been authorized by Congress. Journalist Megan McArdle wrote that \"minting a $1 trillion coin neatly end-runs GOP obstructionists, but only by proving that the president himself has little respect for the institutional restraints on his office.\" Another journalist, Felix Salmon, wrote that the concept \"would effectively mark the demise of the three-branch system of government, by allowing the executive branch to simply steamroller the rights and privileges of the legislative branch\". Salmon went on to explain that he does not agree with what Congressional Republicans are doing, but they have a right to do that, and the president should not use the trillion dollar coin option to circumvent them. In Salmon's words, \"Yes, the legislature is behaving like a bunch of utter morons if they think that driving the US government into default is a good idea. But it's their \"right\" to behave like a bunch of utter morons.\"\n\nOn the other hand, many economists and business analysts endorsed the coin as a way to counter threats by congressional Republicans to force the country into default by refusing to raise the debt limit. Paul Krugman said \"So minting the coin would be undignified, but so what? At the same time, it would be economically harmless — and would both avoid catastrophic economic developments and help head off government by blackmail.\" He also declared the trillion dollar coin debate to be \"the most important fiscal policy debate of our lifetimes\".\n\nMichael Steel, spokesperson of House Speaker John Boehner, dismissed the concept by comparing it to a \"Simpsons\" episode called \"The Trouble with Trillions\", which aired 13 years before the United States debt-ceiling crisis, in which Homer Simpson is on a mission in search of a missing trillion dollar bill.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, Republican congressman Greg Walden announced he would introduce a bill to close the platinum coin loophole.\nRep. Walden said that the intention is to \"take the proposal off the table\". The bill is opposed by New York representative Jerry Nadler, who says that the idea remains a valid option.\n\nOn January 12, 2013, the Treasury and Federal Reserve announced they would not mint a platinum coin, and five days later, Senate Minority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) announced that Senate Republicans would end their threat to block an increase in the debt ceiling.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's purchase of the trillion dollar coin would be largely analogous to the securities purchases that are part of quantitative easing (QE), in both cases adding to the monetary base, which is the sum of currency in circulation and bank reserves. In the case of the coin, commercial bank reserves would increase as the Treasury spent the proceeds from the coin's purchase by the Federal Reserve. If banks loan out these reserves, the money supply increases and if the money supply increases too rapidly, the economy could overheat, adding to inflation and increasing expectations of future inflation. In April 2011 a paper published by the St Louis Federal Reserve Bank said \"some believe QE will sharply increase inflation rates; however, these fears are not consistent with economic theory and empirical evidence — assuming the Federal Reserve is both willing and able to reverse QE as the recovery gains momentum.\" The paper added that \"if the public trusts that the increase in the monetary base QE creates is only temporary, then they will not expect rapid inflation in the near future. These expectations collectively influence actual pricing behavior and, in turn, actual inflation.\" The Federal Reserve could ensure that commercial banks do not lend out excess reserves by paying interest on their reserves at the Fed so that the return commercial banks receive on them is greater than they could receive from alternative uses. Finally, in the case of the coin, the Federal Reserve could also sterilize the government's spending of the coin by selling other assets from its balance sheet on a dollar-for-dollar basis, in which case the effect on the monetary base should net to zero. If the debt ceiling were lifted, the Treasury could use borrowing to buy the coin back from the Federal Reserve and return it to the Mint to be melted.\n\nAlthough the Federal Reserve had already indicated on December 12, 2012, that it wished to expand its balance sheet by another $1.02 trillion throughout 2013 via its ongoing purchases of U.S. Treasuries and government-sponsored mortgage-backed securities, Greg Ip has argued that if the Fed's balance sheet were expanded for ostensibly fiscal policy reasons instead of monetary policy reasons that could constitute an imposition on independence of the central bank. Ip suggested that any such imposition could be avoided if the additional trillion in coinage were issued directly to the public (in more useful smaller denominations) instead of deposited with the Fed. In May 2010 there was $40.4 billion in coin in circulation and about another $900 billion in banknotes.\n\nFormer U.S. Mint Director Edmund C. Moy voiced doubts about whether the Federal Reserve could buy the coin to \"TheStreet.com\", which also noted that under the current system for initiating orders for coinage, the order might have to be placed by former Fed Chair Ben Bernanke or one of the 12 Presidents of the regional Federal Reserve Banks. Former Director Diehl disagreed with Moy concerning a platinum bullion coin but agreed with Moy that a proof platinum coin would be a problem for the Fed. Diehl reiterated his view that \"I certainly think [minting a trillion dollar coin] is inferior to raising or eliminating the [debt] limit but it's far better than defaulting and suffering the consequences of doing so.\"\n\n"}

The NOAA page notes that:\n\nThe strength of the tropical cyclone has made it a device by which authors explain the upending of characters' lives, and even transformations of the personalities of those who live through such an event. Their somewhat hazy predictability also makes them a useful MacGuffin, an impetus for characters to set to action. In some instances, the storm provides cover for characters to engage in covert behavior.\n\nOne of the earliest uses of a tropical cyclone as a plot device occurs in a William Shakespeare play, \"The Tempest\", first performed in 1611 or 1612. There, a storm (raised by the sorcerer Prospero) blows key characters to the island to which Prospero had been exiled many years before. The theme is said to have been inspired by Shakespeare's knowledge of a real-life hurricane which had caused the shipwreck of the \"Sea Venture\" in 1609 on the islands of Bermuda, while sailing toward Virginia.\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, in his 1841 story, \"A Descent into the Maelström\", has the main character describe how \"the most terrible hurricane that ever came out of the heavens\" forced the boat manned by himself and his brothers into a gigantic whirlpool. The trauma of surviving the storm and the whirlpool (and seeing the death of his brothers) is asserted to have a profound effect on the character, causing his hair to turn white. However, since the story is asserted to occur off the coast of Norway, it is unlikely that the event described could have fallen within the formal definition of a hurricane, as such storms form almost exclusively in the Maritime Tropical air masses of tropical regions of the globe.\n\nJoseph Conrad, in his acclaimed 1903 book \"Typhoon\", uses a tropical cyclone as a more direct element of the story, centering the plot on a ship captain's stubborn insistence on going into the heart of such a storm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "355338", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=355338", "title": "Tulum", "text": "Tulum\n\nTulum (, Yucatec: \"Tulu'um\") is the site of a pre-Columbian Mayan walled city which served as a major port for Coba, in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. The ruins are situated on tall cliffs along the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula on the Caribbean Sea in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Tulum was one of the last cities built and inhabited by the Maya; it was at its height between the 13th and 15th centuries and managed to survive about 70 years after the Spanish began occupying Mexico. Old World diseases brought by the Spanish settlers appear to have resulted in very high fatalities, disrupting the society and eventually causing the city to be abandoned. One of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites, Tulum is today a popular site for tourists.\n\nThe site might have been called Zama, meaning \"City of Dawn,\" because it faces the sunrise. Tulum stands on a bluff facing east toward the Caribbean Sea. \"Tulúm\" is also the Yucatán Mayan word for \"fence\", \"wall\" or \"trench.\" The walls surrounding the site allowed the Tulum fort to be defended against invasions. Tulum had access to both land and sea trade routes, making it an important trade hub, especially for obsidian. From numerous depictions in murals and other works around the site, Tulum appears to have been an important site for the worship of the Diving or Descending god.\n\nTulum was first mentioned by Juan Díaz, a member of Juan de Grijalva's Spanish expedition of 1518, the first Europeans to spot Tulum. The first detailed description of the ruins was published by John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood in 1843 in the book \"Incidents of Travel in Yucatan\". As they arrived from the sea, Stephens and Catherwood first saw a tall building that impressed them greatly, most likely the great Castillo of the site. They made accurate maps of the site's walls, and Catherwood made sketches of the Castillo and several other buildings. Stephens and Catherwood also reported an early classic stele at the site, with an inscribed date of AD 564 (now in the British Museum's collection). This has been interpreted as meaning that the stele was likely built elsewhere and brought to Tulum to be reused.\n\nWork conducted at Tulum continued with that of Sylvanus Morley and George P. Howe, beginning in 1913. They worked to restore and open the public beaches. The work was continued by the Carnegie Institution from 1916 to 1922, Samuel Lothrop in 1924 who also mapped the site, Miguel Ángel Fernández in the late 1930s and early 1940s, William Sanders in 1956, and then later in the 1970s by Arthur G. Miller. Through these later investigations done by Sanders and Miller, it has been determined that Tulum was occupied during the late Postclassic period around AD 1200. The site continued to be occupied until contact with the Spanish was made in the early 16th century. By the end of the 16th century, the site was abandoned completely.\n\nTulum has architecture typical of Maya sites on the east coast of the Yucatán Peninsula. This architecture is recognized by a step running around the base of the building which sits on a low substructure. Doorways of this type are usually narrow with columns used as support if the building is big enough. As the walls flare out there are usually two sets of molding near the top. The room usually contains one or two small windows with an altar at the back wall, roofed by either a beam-and-rubble ceiling or being vaulted. This type of architecture resembles what can be found in the nearby Chichen Itza, just on a much smaller scale.\n\nTulum was protected on one side by steep sea cliffs and on the landward side by a wall that averaged about in height. The wall also was about thick and long on the side parallel to the sea. The part of the wall that ran the width of the site was slightly shorter and only about on both sides. Constructing this massive wall would have taken an enormous amount of energy and time, which shows how important defense was to the Maya when they chose this site. On the southwest and northwest corners there are small structures that have been identified as watch towers, showing again how well defended the city was. There are five narrow gateways in the wall with two each on the north and south sides and one on the west. Near the northern side of the wall a small cenote provided the city with fresh water. It is this impressive wall that makes Tulum one of the most well-known fortified sites of the Maya.\n\nThere are three major structures of interest at the Tulum archaeological site. El Castillo, the Temple of the Frescoes, and the Temple of the Descending God. \n\nAmong the more spectacular buildings here is the Temple of the Frescoes that included a lower gallery and a smaller second story gallery. The Temple of the Frescoes was used as an observatory for tracking the movements of the sun. Niched figurines of the Maya “diving god” or Venus deity decorate the facade of the temple. This “diving god” is also depicted in the Temple of the Diving God in the central precinct of the site. Above the entrance in the western wall a stucco figure of the “diving god” is still preserved, giving the temple its name. A mural can still be seen on the eastern wall that resembles that of a style that originated in highland Mexico, called the Mixteca-Puebla style, though visitors are no longer permitted to enter.\n\nThe Temple of the Descending God consists of a single room with a door to the west and a narrow staircase that was built on top of another temple that served as its base.\n\nIn the niche located at the top of the door stands a sculpture that’s found throughout Tulum. He has wings, a headdress and holds an object in his hands.\n\nAlso in the central precinct is the Castillo, which is tall. The Castillo was built on a previous building that was colonnaded and had a beam and mortar roof. The lintels in the upper rooms have serpent motifs carved into them. The construction of the Castillo appears to have taken place in stages. A small shrine appears to have been used as a beacon for incoming canoes. This shrine marks a break in the barrier reef that is opposite the site. Here there is a cove and landing beach in a break in the sea cliffs that would have been perfect for trading canoes coming in. This characteristic of the site may be one of the reasons the Maya founded the city of Tulum exactly here, as Tulum later became a prominent trading port during the late Postclassic.\n\nBoth coastal and land routes converged at Tulum. A number of artifacts found in or near the site show contacts with areas all over Central Mexico and Central America. Copper artifacts from the Mexican highlands have been found near the site, as have flint artifacts, ceramics, incense burners, and gold objects from all over the Yucatán. Salt and textiles were among some of the goods brought by traders to Tulum by sea that would be dispersed inland. Typical exported goods included feathers and copper objects that came from inland sources. These goods could be transported by sea to rivers such as the Río Motagua and the Río Usumacincta/Pasión system, which could be traveled inland, giving seafaring canoes access to both the highlands and the lowlands.\n\nThe Río Motagua starts from the highlands of Guatemala and empties into the Caribbean. The Río Pasión/Ucamacincta river system also originates in the Guatemalan highlands and empties into the Gulf of Mexico. It may have been one of these seafaring canoes that Christopher Columbus first encountered off the shores of the Bay Islands of Honduras. Jade and obsidian appear to be some of the more valuable found here. The obsidian would have been brought from Ixtepeque in northern Guatemala, which was nearly away from Tulum. This huge distance, coupled with the density of obsidian found at the site, show that Tulum was a major center for the trading of obsidian.\n\nTulum archaeological site is relatively compact compared with many other Maya sites in the vicinity, and is one of the best-preserved coastal Maya sites. Its proximity to the modern tourism developments along the Mexican Caribbean coastline and its short distance from Cancún and the surrounding \"Riviera Maya\" has made it a popular Maya tourist site in the Yucatán. Daily tour buses bring a constant stream of visitors to the site. The Tulum ruins are the third most-visited archaeological site in Mexico, after Teotihuacan and Chichen Itza, receiving over 2.2 million visitors in 2017.\n\nA large number of cenotes are located in the Tulum area such as Maya Blue, Naharon, Temple of Doom, Tortuga, Vacaha, Grand Cenote, Abejas, Nohoch Kiin and Carwash cenotes and cave systems.\n\nThe tourist destination is now divided into four main areas: the archaeological site, the \"pueblo\" (or town), the \"zona hotelera\" (or hotel zone) and the biosphere reserve of Sian Ka'an.\n\nIn 1995, tourism came to a brief halt as the powerful Hurricane Roxanne pounded into Tulum, packing 115 mph winds. Damage was moderate.\n\nConsidered a tropical savanna climate typically with a pronounced dry season. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is \"Aw\" (Tropical Savanna Climate).\n\n"}
{"id": "73511", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73511", "title": "T–V distinction", "text": "T–V distinction\n\nIn sociolinguistics, a T–V distinction (from the Latin pronouns and ) is a contrast, within one language, between various forms of addressing one's conversation partner or partners that are specialized for varying levels of politeness, social distance, courtesy, familiarity, age or insult toward the addressee. Many languages lack this type of distinction, instead relying on more explicit wording to convey these meanings. The morphosyntactic T–V distinction, though, is found in a variety of languages around the world.\n\nEnglish does not have a T–V distinction, with the exception of a few dialects. There previously was one with the pronouns \"thou\" and \"you\", with the familiar \"thou\" disappearing from Early Modern English. Additionally British commoners have historically spoken to nobility and royalty using the third person rather than the second person, a practice that has fallen out of favor. English speakers today often employ semantic analogues to convey the mentioned attitudes towards the addressee, such as whether to address someone by given or surname, or whether to use \"sir\"/\"ma'am\". Under a broader classification, T and V forms are examples of honorifics.\n\nThe T–V distinction is expressed in a variety of forms. Two particularly common means are\n\nThe terms T and V, based on the Latin pronouns and , were first used in a paper by the social psychologist Roger Brown and the Shakespearian scholar Albert Gilman. This was a historical and contemporary survey of the uses of pronouns of address, seen as semantic markers of social relationships between individuals. The study considered mainly French, Italian, Spanish and German. The paper was highly influential and with few exceptions, the terms T and V have been used in subsequent studies.\n\nIn Latin, was originally the singular, and the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. According to Brown and Gilman, usage of the plural to the Roman emperor began in the 4th century AD. They mention the possibility that this was because there were two emperors at that time (in Constantinople and Rome), but also mention that \"plurality is a very old and ubiquitous metaphor for power\". This usage was extended to other powerful figures, such as Pope Gregory I (590–604). However, Brown and Gilman note that it was only between the 12th and 14th centuries that the norms for the use of T- and V-forms crystallized. Less commonly, the use of the plural may be extended to other persons, such as the \"royal \"we\"\" (majestic plural) in English.\n\nBrown and Gilman argued that the choice of form is governed by either relationships of 'power' and/or 'solidarity', depending on the culture of the speakers, showing that 'power' had been the dominant predictor of form in Europe until the 20th century. Thus, it was quite normal for a powerful person to use a T-form but expect a V-form in return. However, in the twentieth century the dynamic shifted in favour of solidarity, so that people would use T-forms with those they knew, and V-forms in service encounters, with reciprocal usage being the norm in both cases.\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages (the 5th century to the 10th century), the pronoun was used to address the most exalted figures, emperors and popes, who would use the pronoun to address a subject. This use was progressively extended to other states and societies, and down the social hierarchy as a mark of respect to individuals of higher rank, religious authority, greater wealth, or seniority within a family. The development was slow and erratic, but a consistent pattern of use is estimated to have been reached in different European societies by the period 1100 to 1500. Use of V spread to upper-class individuals of equal rank, but not to lower class individuals.\nThis may be represented in Brown and Gilman's notation:\n\nSpeakers developed greater flexibility of pronoun use by redefining relationships between individuals. Instead of defining the father–son relationship as one of power, it could be seen as a shared family relationship. Brown and Gilman term this the semantics of solidarity. Thus a speaker might have a choice of pronoun, depending on how they perceived the relationship with the person addressed. Thus a speaker with superior power might choose V to express fellow feeling with a subordinate. For example, a restaurant customer might use V to their favourite waiter. Similarly a subordinate with a friendly relationship of long standing might use T. For example, a child might use T to express affection for their parent.\n\nThis may be represented as:\nThese choices were available not only to reflect permanent relationships, but to express momentary changes of attitude. This allowed playwrights such as Racine, Molière, Ben Johnson, Marlowe and Shakespeare to express a character's inner changes of mood through outward changes of pronoun.\n\nFor centuries, it was the more powerful individual who chose to address a subordinate either with T or with V, or to allow the subordinate to choose. For this reason, the pronouns were traditionally defined as the \"pronoun of either condescension or intimacy\" (T) and \"the pronoun of reverence or formality\" (V). Brown and Gilman argue that modern usage no longer supports these definitions.\n\nDevelopments from the nineteenth century have seen the solidarity semantic more consistently applied. It has become less acceptable for a more powerful individual to exercise the choice of pronoun. Officers in most armies are not permitted to address a soldier as T. Most European parents cannot oblige their children to use V. The relationships illustrated above have changed in the direction of the following norms:\nThe tendency to promote the solidarity semantic may lead to the abolition of any choice of address pronoun. During the French Revolution attempts were made to abolish V. In 17th century England the Society of Friends obliged its members to use only T to everyone, and some continue to use T (\"thee\") to one another. In most Modern English dialects the choice of T no longer exists outside of poetry.\n\nIt was reported in 2012 that use of the French and the Spanish are in decline in social media. An explanation offered was that such online communications favour the philosophy of equality, regardless of usual formal distinctions. Similar tendencies were observed in German, Persian and Chinese as well as in Italian.\n\nThe Old English and Early Middle English second person pronouns and (with variants) were used for singular and plural reference respectively with no T–V distinction. The earliest entry in the Oxford English Dictionary for \"ye\" as a V pronoun in place of the singular \"thou\" exists in a Middle English text of 1225 composed in 1200. The usage may have started among the Norman French nobility in imitation of French. It made noticeable advances during the second half of the 13th century. During the 16th century, the distinction between the subject form \"ye\" and the object form \"you\" was largely lost, leaving \"you\" as the usual V pronoun (and plural pronoun). After 1600, the use of \"ye\" in standard English was confined to literary and religious contexts or as a consciously archaic usage.\n\nDavid Crystal summarises Early Modern English usage thus:\n\nV would normally be used\n\nT would normally be used\n\nThe T–V distinction was still well preserved when Shakespeare began writing at the end of the 16th century. However, other playwrights of the time made less use of T–V contrasts than Shakespeare. The infrequent use of T in popular writing earlier in the century such as the Paston Letters suggest that the distinction was already disappearing from gentry speech. In the first half of the 17th century, \"thou\" disappeared from Standard English, although the T–V distinction was preserved in many regional dialects. When the Quakers began using \"thou\" again in the middle of the century, many people were still aware of the old T–V distinction and responded with derision and physical violence.\n\nIn the 19th century, one aspect of the T–V distinction was restored to some English dialects in the form of a pronoun that expressed friendly solidarity, written as \"y'all\". Unlike earlier \"thou\", it was used primarily for plural address, and in some dialects for singular address as well. The pronoun was first observed in the southern states of the US among African-American speakers, although its precise origin is obscure. The pronoun spread rapidly to White speakers in those southern states, and (to a lesser extent) other regions of the US and beyond. This pronoun is not universally accepted, and may be regarded as either nonstandard or a regionalism.\n\n\"Yous(e)\" (pron. , ) as a plural is found mainly in (Northern) England, Scotland, parts of Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, northern Nova Scotia and parts of Ontario in Canada and parts of the northeastern United States (especially areas where there was historically Irish or Italian immigration), including in Boston, Philadelphia, New York, and scattered throughout working class Italian-American communities in the American Rust Belt. It also occurs in Scouse (the regional dialect of the Liverpool area).\n\nIn Old French texts, the pronouns and are often used interchangeably to address an individual, sometimes in the same sentence. However, some emerging pattern of use has been detected by recent scholars. Between characters equal in age or rank, was more common than as a singular address. However, was sometimes used to put a young man in his place, or to express temporary anger. There may also have been variation between Parisian use and that of other regions.\n\nIn the Middle French period a relatively stable T–V distinction emerged. \"Vous\" was the V form used by upper-class speakers to address one another, while was the T form used among lower class speakers. Upper-class speakers could choose to use either T or V when addressing an inferior. Inferiors would normally use V to a superior. However, there was much variation; in 1596 in his comprehensive survey observed that the French sometimes used to inferiors as well as to superiors \"\" (\"according to our natural tendencies\"). In poetry, was often used to address kings or to speak to God.\n\nThe boundaries between formal and informal language differ from language to language, as well as within social groups of the speakers of a given language. In some circumstances, it is not unusual to call other people by first name and the respectful form, or last name and familiar form. For example, German teachers use the former construct with upper-secondary students, while Italian teachers typically use the latter (switching to a full V-form with university students). This can lead to constructions denoting an intermediate level of formality in T–V-distinct languages that sound awkward to English-speakers. In Italian, can be addressed with the (familiar) form or the (formal) one, but complete addresses range from (peer to peer or family) and (teacher or fellow student to high-school student, as stated above) to (live-in servant to master or master's son) and (senior staff member to junior) and (among peers).\n\nThe use of these forms may be an issue for compensating translation of dialogue into English if the translator does not wish to use the \"thou\" pronoun to translate. For example, a character in a French film or novel saying \"\" (\"Use [the informal pronoun] when addressing me!\") might be translated \"Do not be so formal!\" or \"Call me by my first name!\"\n\nConversely, when translating from English to a T–V language, the translator must decide again and again throughout the work which second-person form the reader would deem the more appropriate in a given situation. In the current German DVD release of \"Gone with the Wind\", the translators of the dubbed soundtrack and of the subtitles sometimes make opposite decisions; the actors dubbed voices speak with the familiar form, while the subtitles for the same scene are more formal.\n\nIn many languages, the respectful singular pronoun derives from a plural form. Some Romance languages have familiar forms derived from the Latin singular and respectful forms derived from Latin plural , sometimes via a circuitous route. Sometimes, singular V-form derives from a third person pronoun; in German and some Nordic languages, it is the third person \"plural\". Some languages have separate T and V forms for both singular and plural; others have the same form; others have a T–V distinction only in the singular.\n\nDifferent languages distinguish pronoun uses in different ways. Even within languages, there are differences between groups (older people and people of higher status tending both to use and to expect more respectful language) and between various aspects of one language. For example, in Dutch, V form is slowly falling into disuse in the plural, thus one could sometimes address a group as T form (which clearly expresses the plural) when one would address each member individually as (which has the disadvantage of being ambiguous). In Latin American Spanish, the opposite change has occurred – having lost the T form , Latin Americans address all groups as , even if the group is composed of friends whom they would call or (both T forms). In Standard Peninsular Spanish however, (literally, \"you others\") is still regularly employed in familiar conversation. In some cases V-forms are likely to be capitalized when written.\n\nThe following is a table of the nominative case of the singular and plural second person in many languages, including their respectful variants (if any):\n\nModern Afrikaans rarely makes the distinction between the informal and (\"you\" subject and \"your\" / \"you\" object) and the more formal (or when addressing God), although sometimes it is upheld in a formal setting, such as in politics, business or in a polite conversation. The trend is moving towards using the informal pronoun most often.\n\nOld Dutch did not appear to have a T–V distinction. was used as the second-person singular, and as the second-person plural. In early Middle Dutch, influenced by Old French usage, the original plural pronoun (or in the north) came to be used as a respectful singular pronoun, creating a T–V distinction. However, the formal started to be used in more and more situations. By the 17th century, had largely fallen out of use, although it lingered on in some of the more peripheral areas. At this point, the original T–V distinction had been lost, and the original V-pronoun / was used universally for both singular and plural regardless of the type of address. This resembled the state of English today, which has also (outside of dialectal, literary or religious use) lost its original T-pronoun \"thou\".\n\nAround this time, a new formal pronoun started to come into use. This was also the object form of the subject pronoun /, and how it came to be used as a subject pronoun is not exactly clear. It is usually related to a form of address in writing of the time: letters were often addressed formally to , standing for (\"Your Highness\"), which is thought to have been shortened to eventually. It can be compared to the Spanish , which is a similar contraction of a phrase of indirect address. As in Spanish, the Dutch was originally conjugated as the third person in verbs, although most verbs had identical second- and third-person singular forms, so that this difference was not apparent for the most part. It remains today in the use of (\"you (formal) have\", like \"he has\"), compared to (\"you (informal) have\"). However, is now also common.\n\nAround the same time, it became more common to clarify when multiple people were being spoken to, by adding , (\"people\"), or a shortened variety, to the end of the pronoun. Thus, when speaking to multiple people, one would use or . This combination was contracted and fused over time, eventually resulting in , the informal plural pronoun that is used today. It can be compared, in its origin, to the English \"y'all\" or Spanish .\n\nModern northern Dutch, and usually standard Dutch as well, has two forms of second person pronouns, namely and . is the formal pronoun, whereas is used as the informal personal pronoun to address a single person. In the plural, is also used, alongside the informal . In the south, only one pronoun, , is generally used in all three roles: both singular and plural, formal and informal. \"U\" is sometimes also used in formal situations, but the southern does not have a distinct informal connotation like the northern/standard , and can be used to address anyone without offence. Religious Dutch speakers in all areas address God using either or ; is never used. For speakers of the north, this is usually the only place where is encountered, giving it a formal and archaic tone, even though it is neutral in the southern areas where it is still used.\n\nThe pronoun (unstressed variant of ) can also be used impersonally, corresponding to the English generic you. The more formal Dutch term corresponding to English generic you or one is .\n\nIn Dutch the formal personal pronoun is used for older people or for people with a higher or equal status, unless the addressed makes it clear they want to be spoken to with the informal pronoun. Unlike for example in German, there is no defined line (in the case of German, roughly when someone passes the age of 16) in which everyone, apart from family, is addressed with the formal pronoun. Addressing parents by has become very rare; is often even used to address grandparents. There is also a tendency towards more use of the informal pronoun. Some companies such as IKEA consciously address their customers with the informal . However, can still be considered more or less obligatory in situations where, for example, a pupil addresses their teacher, people testify in court or communication between a doctor and their patient.\n\nContemporary English generally uses only the form \"you\", regardless of level of familiarity.\n\nOld English used in the second-person singular for both formal and informal contexts. Following the Norman Conquest, the Middle English that emerged continued to use ' at first, but by the 13th century, Norman French influence had led to the use of the second-person plural or in formal contexts.\n\nIn Early Modern English superiors and strangers were therefore respectfully addressed as \"ye\" in the nominative and \"you\" in the objective; \"thou\" and \"thee\" were used for familiars and subordinates. The more widespread and observed this division became, the more pejorative it became to strangers to be called by the familiar form of address. By the 17th century, such a use among the nobility was strongly and deliberately contemptuous, as in the declamation of the prosecutor at Sir Walter Raleigh's 1603 trial \"I thou thee, thou traitor!\" Accordingly, the use of \"thou\" began to decline and it was effectively extinct in the everyday speech of most English dialects by the early 18th century, supplanted by the polite \"you\", even when addressing children and animals, something also seen in Dutch and Latin America (most of Brazil and parts of Spanish America). Meanwhile, as part of English's continuing development away from its synthetic origins since the influx of French vocabulary following the Norman invasion, \"you\" had been replacing \"ye\" since the 15th century. Standard English was left with a single second-person pronoun for all cases, numbers and contexts and largely incapable of maintaining a T–V distinction.\nNotwithstanding all of this, the translators of the King James version of the Bible chose to employ the older forms in their work (1604–1611) in order to convey the grammatical distinctions made by their Hebrew, Greek and Latin sources. Its subsequent popularity and the religious rationale of many who continued to employ \"thou\" has preserved its use in English, but made it seem pious and ironically \"more\" formal and respectful than the everyday \"you\".\n\nIn the United States, some Protestant sects, such as the Quakers and Mormons insisted on addressing everyone as \"thou\", because they considered every person to be a friend and an equal. This persisted until the 19th or early 20th century.\n\nIn West Frisian, the formal singular nominative (pronounced \"yo\") is very close to the English \"you\" and the Middle and Early Modern English . There is no such distinction in the plural; the plural second person pronoun is always . , a Dutch dialect with strong Frisian influence, parallels this distinction (, , ).\n\nWest Frisian is used slightly more often than Dutch . Native speakers of Dutch are sometimes warned against addressing newly acquainted people with too soon.\n\nIn German, the formal address is the same as the third person plural pronoun . Verbs used with this form of address are also identical to third person plural forms. The polite form and its inflected forms are always capitalized in writing, to avoid any ambiguity.\n\nThe corresponding informal German address is or . The verbs and mean respectively \"to address using \" and \"to address using \" and the phrases or mean, \"to be on du terms\". The use of often coincides with the use of the title plus surname, usage of which is more widespread in German-speaking areas than Anglophone areas. In general terms, is used to children, animals and God, and between adults (or between adults and children) who are good friends of or related to each other. is used in other situations, such as in a business situation or where there is no existing relationship. In Internet chats and forums, Germans rarely use , although there are exceptions. Except in the case of adults addressing children, where it is common for the child to address the adult as , but be addressed as in return, it is not common in German for one party to address the other as , but be addressed as in return. In almost all cases it can be considered as impolite to use the \"wrong\" pronoun, that is a pronoun that is not expected by the other party. However on the other hand, using an unexpected can also be a very welcome sign of affection, and using an unexpected can, in the young, be a very welcome sign of appreciation of the addressed one's maturity.\n\nHigh school students in Germany are often called plus given name () by their teachers when they enter the  — the last 2 or 3 years of high school — around the age of 16.\n\nChildren and teenagers are expected to use when addressing all adults except for family members and family friends whom they have known since early childhood. Street and similar social workers, sports clubs trainers will sometimes tell children and teens to address them with . In shops, bars, and other establishments, if they target a younger audience, it is becoming increasingly common for customers and staff to address each other as , to the degree that it is sometimes considered awkward if a waitress and a customer who are both in their twenties call each other .\n\nThe use of or between two strangers may also be determined by the setting in which they meet (casual/formal), as well as clothing (casual/formal), gender (same/opposite), and personal preference. For example, it is customary to use in traditional small pubs and taverns in certain regions (including the Rhineland). This applies also to older people, whom one would otherwise address as . Two people who addressed each other as in a pub may go back to when they meet in the street if their acquaintance was only very superficial. During the famous Rhenish carnival, it is customary for most revelers to address each other as . Only if the age difference is more than one generation, the younger person might still use . Another setting in which is often used between adults is sporting events.\n\nBeing has also become increasingly common in workplace environments (depending on the line of business and corporate culture to varying degrees), mostly regardless of age. In such environments, the basis may also be observed as a (sometimes necessary) mark of good social integration within a working group. As a rule of thumb, one might expect to see team colleagues on the workplace level in many industries on a customary basis with each other, though not always with the group manager and more rarely with higher-ranking managers. As entrants to a team are more closely integrated, this is often marked by making an informal affirmation to that basis or by formally offering it, as a matter of style and habituality. Both the tempo and extent of using the basis depends much on the culture (and sometimes the climate) of the business, and in some places even more so on that of the particular workgroup itself. Business cultures that pride themselves on a \"flat hierarchy\" are more likely to adopt or accent a general professional parlance of and given name while inside corporations tending to emphasize professional formality, a may be expected to be used always except between very close colleagues or inside closed groups (sometimes including managers meeting on the same level with the exclusion of any subordinates), and strictly always in the presence of a superior. The superior, on the other hand, has the right to address the other perform informally or formally, which is a personal preference.\n\nCustomarily, the switch from to is initially proposed by the elder of the two people, the person with socially higher standing or by the lady to the gentleman. Alternatively, one person may use while they ask the other person if it is acceptable to be addressed informally, and then act accordingly. One way to propose the use of rather than is by stating one's first name (as in: ). One accepts the proposal by introducing one's own first name. Should a person later forget that they have adopted , it is polite to remind them by saying, (We moved on to terms). Sometimes switching back to is used as a method of distancing oneself from the addressee; the connotation is slightly ironic courtesy.\n\nThe inappropriate and uninvited use of towards someone who would otherwise reasonably expect to be addressed as is considered to be condescending and disrespectful, although insistence on in an environment where is largely accepted (flat hierarchies) can be interpreted as being equally disrespectful. The degree of offense that might be taken will depend on how obvious the etiquette violation was (an example of an obvious violation would be a teenager in the street addressing an elderly stranger on the street with , addressing a senior manager with as a result of a misjudged professional relationship would probably be taken with less offense), and will also depend on the upbringing of the person in question – progressive vs. conservative outlooks and age are examples of factors which can play a role in how individuals prefer to be addressed and choose to address others.\n\nIt has become the policy of some businesses for their employees to address customers with , often to set a progressive, \"modern\" tone, occasionally for other cultural reasons. IKEA, for instance, does this to reflect the widespread use of the form in Sweden (see ).\n\nIn Germany, an old custom (called , drinking brotherhood) involves two friends formally sharing a bottle of wine or drinking a glass of beer together to celebrate their agreement to call one another rather than . This custom has also been adopted among the Swiss-French of the Jura, in Poland and Russia (called by its German name, spelled and respectively), though the custom in Poland is now slowly disappearing. It was formerly found also in Sweden.\n\nAlthough the use of generally coincides with the use of title plus surname, especially in northern and eastern Germany, there is an intermediate address combining with the first name (), whereas in the Berlin region, sometimes is combined with the surname (). The former usage also occurs when addressing teenagers, household staff, or guests of TV or radio programs, while the latter style is usually considered inferior and mainly occurs in working class environments. It may be associated with professional contexts, when colleagues have known one another for a long time, but, e. g. due to differences of status, do not want to switch to the usual style; or in situations where strangers (e.g. customers) are present for whom it would not be appropriate to learn the first name of the addressee.\n\nWhen speaking to more than one person in formal situations where one would use to each one of them separately, Standard German uses . However, in this situation can often be heard instead, especially in the South of Germany and in Swiss German dialects, and is standard usage for pastors when preaching. If the standard here is followed, then the usage varies when addressing a group containing both and persons: Some speakers use the informal plural others prefer the formal and many, concerned that both pronouns might cause offence, prefer to use circumlocutions that avoid either pronoun, for example by expressing an imperative in infinitive form (), by applying the passive voice (), or using the indefinite pronoun ().\n\nFormerly, the 2nd person plural (\"ye\") was used to address social superiors, unless more informal relations had been established. The use of as the polite form, as this is the case with in the French language, has still survived in Bernese German and other Alemannic dialects. in this case has to be capitalized. However, itself shows a degree of informality, and would for example be used in addressing one's father. For the formal address, the third person would be used; and this in the singular with , (capitalized) to a social inferior, as a farmer addressing a stableboy, or in the plural to a social superior. It is from the latter occurrences that modern takes its origin; is the 3rd person plural pronoun. However, itself is relatively young, and it was rather the formal addresses, often itself singular forms, that took the plural. Even as late as in Dürrenmatt's \"The Visit\" (written in 1956), an address (\"You do know that, Mr Mayor\", modern German would just say ) can be found; Herr Bürgermeister is the formal address and itself a singular term, but wissen is plural. However, if the formal address itself contains a personal pronoun as in (His Majesty) etc., this one would be put to the 2nd person plural: (not: ) (\"What does [but plural] Your Majesty condescend to order?\")\n\nThus, all these go by a similar grammar rule pertaining to the verb used with these addresses as modern . The dated capitalized address demands the same verb form as the modern second person plural pronoun , the dated / demands the same verb form as the modern third person singular and , and the dated 3rd person plural address without demands, just as itself, the same verb form as the 3rd person plural pronoun (they).\n\nThe forms are still found today in some dialects as a respectful way of addressing elders, and is still very often found in works of art and literature (such as books and movies) depicting events at least several centuries in the past, or in a \"past-like\" fantasy setting, even if modern German is otherwise used in these works; indeed, using the modern in such a setting would be considered an out-of-place anachronism. and the 3rd person plural without is somewhat analogous to the English majestic plural.\n\nThe / form is not widely known or understood by the average person any more. While is often still used in dubbed films, especially in medieval/fantasy contexts such as Lord of the Rings e.g. \"\" (\"you have entered the Realm of the Lady of the Wood, you can not turn back\"). In this context, a historical level is used where the second person plural indicates some nobility of or respect for the addressee, such that from being used to address a single person, the viewer could mostly, without looking, conclude that the person was of elevated rank such as a king or nobleman, or at least being treated with expressed regard. would not normally be used to address a peasant (unless he is a prince in disguise or a future prince and the person addressing him has gathered some knowledge or presumption of that).\n\nIn Danish, the informal second-person singular is and the formal form of address uses the third-person plural , capitalized to distinguish it from its other use. The second-person plural and the third-person singular (\"he\") or (\"she\") were sometimes used until the early 19th century in standard Danish and awhile longer in the countryside. The German-inspired form entered Danish in the 18th century, too late to enter liturgical use. In church, as in rural or dialect-speaking areas, has always been the universal form, especially in Jutland.\n\nAs in other Scandinavian languages, even among the prestige dialects, the formal pronoun is waning in use — in the case of Danish, since the (\"Youth Revolts\") during and after the protests of 1968. As a general rule, the informal is accepted everywhere today, except when addressing royalty or during military service. In other contexts, it has come to seem excessively formal and old-fashioned to most Danes. Even at job interviews and among parliamentarians, has become standard.\n\nIn written Danish, remains current in legal, legislative, and formal business documents, as well as in some translations from other languages. This is sometimes audience-dependent, as in the Danish government's general use of except in healthcare information directed towards the elderly, where is still used. Other times, it is maintained as an affectation, as by the staff of some formal restaurants, the newspaper, TV 2 announcers, and the avowedly conservative Maersk corporation. Attempts by other corporations to avoid sounding either stuffy or too informal by employing circumlocutions — using passive phrasing or using the pronoun (\"one\") — have generally proved awkward and been ill-received, and (with the notable exception of the national railway DSB) most have opted for the more personable form.\n\nModern Icelandic is the Scandinavian dialect closest to Old Norse, which made a distinction between the plural and the dual . This distinction continued in written Icelandic the early 1920 when the plural was also used on formal occasions. The formal usage of seems to have pushed the dual to take over the plural so modern Icelandic normally uses as a plural. However, in formal documents such as by the president is still used as plural, and the usage of as plural and as dual is still retained in the Icelandic translation of the Christian scriptures. There are still a number of fixed expressions — particularly religious adages such as \"seek and ye shall find\" () — and the formal pronoun is sometimes used in translations from a language that adheres to a T–V distinction, but otherwise it appears only when one wants to be excessively formal either from the gravity of the occasion (as in court proceedings and legal correspondence) or out of contempt (in order to ridicule another person's self-importance), and is used in all other cases.\n\nIn Norwegian, the polite form / () and / () has more or less disappeared in both spoken and written language. Norwegians now exclusively use , and the polite form does not have a strong cultural pedigree in the country. Until recently, would sometimes be found in written works, business letters, plays and translations where an impression of formality must be retained. The popular belief that is reserved for the king is incorrect, since according to royal etiquette, the King (and other members of the royal family) will be addressed as ()/ () (Your majesty) or in third person singular as (His majesty), / (Her majesty), (the King), (the Queen) and similar.\n\nNorwegians generally refer to one another by first name only, unless the person is better known by full or last name only. This also contributes to the weakening of these pronouns and a general pattern of declining use of polite speech. For example, a student might address their professor by their first name, but would refer to a leading politician by their last name. Norwegian politicians and celebrities are sometimes referred to by their first names, especially in newspaper headlines, while the text of the article most likely would use the person's last name. Nicknames are not very common.\n\nThe distinction between and exists primarily for written Norwegian (most Norwegians speak dialects that differ from the standard written forms), and the T–V rules are the same for both forms—except that uses the third person plural to indicate politeness (as in German), while uses the second person plural (as in French). In both forms, when these pronouns are used to indicate politeness, they are always capitalised (to show deference, and separate them from when they indicate, respectively, the third and second person plural).\n\nIn Swedish, there has in the last two centuries been a marked difference between usage in Finland Swedish and in Sweden.\n\nIn the Swedish of Sweden, the polite was known from earlier epochs, but had come to be considered somewhat careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost altogether. Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the 1960s.\n\nAs the 20th century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. In the sixties, the so-called ('thou-reform') was carried out. First, authorities and influential circles tried rehabilitating the in a so-called \" reform\"—but most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, almost overnight and dubbed the \" reform\", the system broke down, and (noted as informal above) became the accepted way of addressing anyone except for royalty.\n\nAddressing royalty went somewhat more slowly from a universal ('Your Majesty'), etc., to that address only on formal occasions, otherwise replaced by third person (singular if the addressee is single) with title ( 'the King', etc.).\n\nThese rules still apply, with marginal exceptions. The vast majority of Swedes, including younger people in most or all situations, stick to the . In order to \"alleviate the intrusion\" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal \"du\" address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial revival.\n\nFinland Swedish has undergone a similar development to mainland Swedish since the 1960s, but slower and slightly less. There, one may have to reckon with influence from the Finnish language, still slightly more conservative. In Finland Swedish, the second person plural form (noted as formal above) was indeed the traditional respectful address to a single person up to the 1970s or so.\n\nSwedish, also, has verbs for the addresses: 'to say ', and 'to say '.\n\nIn Modern Scots the second person singular nominative (, Southern Scots , Shetlandic ) survived in colloquial speech until the mid 19th century in most of lowland Scotland. It has since been replaced by / in most areas except in Insular Scots where (, Shetlandic ) is also used, in North Northern Scots and in some Southern Scots varieties. is used as the familiar form by parents speaking to children, elders to youngsters, or between friends or equals. The second person formal singular or is used when speaking to a superior or when a youngster addresses an elder. The older second person singular possessive (), and (, Shetlandic along with ) still survive to some extent where remains in use.\n\nYiddish makes use of the second person plural form as the polite form for both singular and plural. In the second person plural form (), there is therefore no distinction between formal and informal forms. There is a dialectal pronoun () strictly for informal second-person plural form, but this pronoun is rarely used today and is only found in some dialects of Poland and neighboring regions.\n\nGiven that old German dialects were the main influence on the development of the Yiddish language, this form may be recognized with older polite forms of the German language.\n\nIn most French-speaking regions (Canada is an exception; see \"North American French\" below), a rigid T–V distinction is upheld. With regard to the second person singular, is used informally, whereas is used to convey formality. (The second person plural is always .) The formal is expected when encountering any unknown adult under normal circumstances. In general, the switch from to is \"negotiated\" on a case-by-case basis; it can happen nearly unconsciously, or can be explicitly negotiated. For instance, some couples have been known to call each other for some time while dating, and gradually switch to calling each other . The verb means \"address someone with -forms, speak informally\"; by contrast means \"address someone with forms\". Rigidly sticking to \"vous\" can become equally awkward in a long-standing relationship.\n\nIn certain circumstances, however, is used more broadly. For example, new acquaintances who are conscious of having something socially significant in common (e.g., student status, or the same \"rank\" in some hierarchy) often use \"tu\" more or less immediately. In some cases, there may be an explicitly defined practice in a particular company, political party, as to the use of and . Also, using the in conjunction with someone's given name is rather current in France as a less formal way of addressing someone, e.g. at work, among members of an association etc. Children and adolescents generally use to speak with someone of their own age, whether known or not. can also be used to show disrespect to a stranger, such as when surprising a thief or cursing other drivers on the road.\n\nIn families, was traditionally used to address older family members. Children were taught to use to address their parents, and was used until about 1950 between spouses of the higher classes. Former president Jacques Chirac and his wife Bernadette are a prominent example of the continuation of this usage.\n\nWhen praying, is nowadays often used in addressing the deity, though was used in Catholic prayers until the Second Vatican Council, and is still used to address the Blessed Virgin Mary. In Louisiana, however, is always used to convey a sense of respect and reverence when praying.\n\nIn Walloon, the use of which tends, in any case, to be restricted mostly to \"familiar\" contexts, (equivalent to ) is the general usage and is considered informal and friendly. (equivalent to ), on the other hand, is considered vulgar, and its use can be taken as an expression of an aggressive attitude towards the person addressed. This influence from Walloon affects the usage of and in the French spoken in Belgium, though more so among people accustomed to using Walloon as their everyday language (a tiny minority, mostly in the countryside). The influence of Standard French, particularly as exercised through the mass media, is eroding this particularity among younger French-speakers.\n\nIn the , the use of honorific styles or their abbreviation (literally \"she\", irrespective of the gender of the addressee, as the honorifics were feminine nouns) together with the 3rd person singular was also common. See below for Italian which has kept this style.\n\nNorth American dialects of French, including Quebec French and Acadian French as well as Louisiana French, permit and expect a far broader usage of the familiar than in Standard French. There are still circumstances in which it is necessary to say : in a formal interview (notably for a job) or when addressing people of very high rank (such as judges or prime ministers), senior citizens, between professors and students in universities, towards customers or new acquaintances in a formal setting. As acquaintances become familiar with one another, they may find to be unnecessarily formal and may agree to return to the with which they are generally more comfortable.\n\nFor a number of Francophones in Canada, sounds stilted or snobbish, and archaic. is by no means restricted to intimates or social inferiors. There is however an important minority of people, often those who call for a use of standard French in Quebec, who prefer to be addressed as . At Radio-Canada (the public broadcaster, often considered as establishing the normative objectives of standard French in Canada), the use of is widespread even among colleagues.\n\nIn , local languages (such as Baoulé, Dioula, etc.) do not make a distinction between informal or formal pronouns, which reflects on the local usage of French. It is thus uncommon to call an individual . A waiter, shop-keeper or taxi driver can very well call a customer , just like an employee towards a superior. For example, an accountant could call her direct branch manager , but will still use to address the company's CEO.\n\nRelationships between men and women are typically less formal than between people of the same gender (a female supermarket worker will more easily say towards a male customer than her male colleague).\n\nEven in formal situations (business, politics), the superiors can often be called in a familiar way by subordinates who will use affectionate terms of address such as , , , , for males, , , , for females, instead of the standard and . Superiors reciprocate with terms of address such as , , , . All those terms of address typically exclude the use of \"vous\".\n\nThe use is also conditioned to the \"level\" of French being spoken: using a Standard French code and/or accent (what is call in Ivorian French) will prompt addresses of , whereas code switching to Ivorian French will typically invite a concomitant switch to .\n\nInformed local people will still, most of the time, make a conscious effort to use and / when addressing Westerners in formal situations (unless, again, that Westerner talks Ivorian French rather than Standard French). Other groups of foreigners such as other Africans, Asians or Middle-Eastern people are less likely to enjoy that \"privilege\".\n\nThe use of , just like the use of and , is thus restricted to very formal situations where Standard French is being used, mostly for the higher class between themselves: managers at a meeting with the CEO, representatives of different political parties, upper class people who don't know each other at a social gathering. A switching to can still happen as soon as the formal event is over (such as managers getting out of the meeting room) or just after having been introduced to each other – usually simultaneous to a switch from Standard French to Ivorian French.\n\nCatalan uses the singular pronouns (informal) and (formal), while (informal) and (formal) are used for two or more addressees. The form , used instead of to address someone respectfully, follows the same concordance rules as the French (verbs in second person plural, adjectives in singular), and follows the same concordance rules as the Spanish (verbs in third person). originated from as a calque from Spanish, and replaced the original Catalan form .\n\nIn some dialects, is no longer used. Other dialects have a three-way distinction / / , where is used as a respectful form for elders and respected friends, and for foreigners and people whom one does not know well. is more distant than .\n\nThe Administration uses to address people.\n\nIn Peninsular, Mexican, and Peruvian Spanish, as in Italian, an original and usage similar to French disappeared in the Early Modern period. Today, is used for informal and familiar address while the respectful form is the third-person , which can be used respectfully to anyone. Scholars argue that evolved as a contraction of the Old Spanish (\"your mercy\"), with as a transitional form. In some cases, the title is also employed when speaking to a respected older man, while is used for older women.\n\nAmong Spanish dialects, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Spanish Empire was created during the middle of this linguistic shift, leading to differing linguistic norms being established across its territory. The region surrounding the Colombian capital of Bogotá (although not the city itself) preserves an alternate respectful form simplified from a different contraction of . In Rioplatense, was preserved — but as a replacement for and not as a respectful form of address; in Chile, in Western Venezuela, parts of Colombia and in Central America, is used in spoken address and is used in print and to express moderate formality, that is, it has essentially switched its function to the former role of . In Costa Rica and part of Colombia, is used as the common pronoun, using it both in formal and informal situations.\n\nIn the second-person plural, modern Spanish speakers in most of Spain employ (masculine) and (feminine) informally and (as the third-person plural) to express respect. In western Andalucia, is used in both contexts, but its verbs are conjugated in the second-person plural. Throughout the Americas and the Canaries, is used in all contexts and in the third person.\n\nIn European Portuguese (as well as in Africa, Timor-Leste and Macau), (singular \"you\") is commonly used as the familiar addressing pronoun, while is a general form of address; (plural both of and ) is used for both familiar and general. The forms and (plurals and ) are used for more formal situations (roughly equivalent to \"Mr/Sir\" and \"Mrs/Madam\".) Similarly to some Romance languages (e.g. Italian), can be omitted because the verb ending provides the necessary information. Not so much so with or / because the verb ending is the same as for the third person (historically, derives from (\"your mercy\" or \"your grace\") via the intermediate forms and ). The second person plural pronoun , from Latin , is archaic in most of the Portuguese-speaking world, but can be heard in liturgy and has a limited regional use.\n\nIn Brazilian Portuguese, and (singular and plural \"you\", respectively) are used informally, while and (\"Mr\"/\"Sir\" and \"Mrs\"/\"Madam\", plurals and ) are used in formal speech. Although now seen as archaic, is used when speaking ironically, very formally or when one is demonstrating respect to a superior and it is sometimes replaced by (\"Lady\"). Informal terms of respect to superiors, elders or strangers are (abbreviation of ) and (feminine of i.e. ). / and (\"Lad\"/\"Young man\" and \"Lady\") are used by seniors when addressing non-intimate youths and also as an equalizing form among strange youths. (\"youngster\") is used in the same manner by elders when addressing strange youths of both genders.\n\nOn premises where the atmosphere requires extreme formality like the Senate or different courts, the protocolar forms to address dignitaries (\"Your Excellence\") and (\"Your Lordship/Ladyship\") can still be heard. In a direct address to a judge or the president, must follow the vocatives (\"Your Honour\", literally \"full of merit\") and (\"Mr/Mrs\" President). When addressing an ecclesiastical dignitary the form (\"Your Reverence\") is used. Although is regarded as protocolar, it is an equalizing form.\n\nIn many parts of the geographic extension of the language e.g. most of Southern and Northeastern Brazil, some sociolects of coastal São Paulo, mainly in Greater Santos, colloquial sociolect, mainly among the less educated and some all-class youths of Greater Rio de Janeiro, and in Uruguay, \"tu\" (singular \"you\" or simply \"thou\") is used informally, but the plural form is always . For the overwhelmingly majority of people, the pronoun is commonly used with the verb conjugated as (third-person singular) rather than in the traditional conjugation (second-person singular). is somewhat familiar, even intimate, and should never be addressed to superiors, or strange elders, while is much more neutral, although equalizing.\n\nThe dialect that includes , capital city of Santa Catarina, as well as its shore and inner regions in the proximity like Blumenau, is an exception, as the use of is widespread, even addressing formally to an authority or to a superior. It is one of the few dialects in Brazil in which second-person singular agreement is used (along with the relatively conservative dialect of the state of ).\n\nIn Standard Italian the informal second-person singular pronoun is and the formal second-person singular pronoun is ( \"she\",  \"her\"), always used with the third-person singular conjugation of the verb. The pronouns may be freely omitted. Despite the original meaning of , modern Italian typically concords with the gender of the addressee when is the sentence subject; using feminine adjectives for a male addressee is not especially insulting but sounds confusing, literary or even archaic. When is an object, using feminine adjectives is normal (, i.e. \"I saw you (m.)\"), whereas gender concord is considered non-standard (, i.e. \"I saw you (m.)).\n\nAlthough seldom encountered, the third person or (\"Your Lord-\" or \"Ladyship\") is sometimes seen in formal correspondence and invitations, as a stronger form of its descendant .\n\nThe Romanian word when used for the second-person singular formal takes plural verbs but singular adjectives, similar to French . It is used roughly in the same manner as in Continental French and shows no signs of disappearing. It is also used as a more formal . It originates from – your lordship. In the past it was used extreme rarely to nobles especially, but its sense extended to other people in the 20th century but not so common and when the communists arrived it took the actual form. As happens with all subject pronouns, is often omitted from sentences, its use being implied by verbs in the second person plural form.\n\nThe form (originating from – thy lordship) is less distant than and somewhat midway between and . The verb is conjugated, as for , in the second person singular form. Older people towards younger people and peers favor . Its use is gradually declining.\n\nA more colloquial form of is , or . It is more familiar than and is used only in some regions of Romania. It is used only with immediate family members, and is spelled and pronounced the same in all cases, similar to . It is used with verbs in the second person singular, as is .\n\nThe plural form is a recent borrowing. Proto-Romanian and Aromanian, like Classical Latin, do not have the plural form.\n\nMost dialects of Sicilian Language have utilised , , or to express formality. However, due to encroachment by Italian language has become increasingly common particularly among younger speakers.\n\nIn Ancient Greek, () was the singular, and () the plural, with no distinction for honorific or familiar. Paul addresses King Agrippa II as (Acts 26:2).\n\nLater, and (,\"we\") became too close in pronunciation, and a new plural or (/) was invented, the initial () being a euphonic prefix that was also extended to the singular (/).\n\nIn Modern Greek, (, second person plural) with second person plural verb conjugation is used as the formal counterpart of (, second person singular) when talking to strangers and elders, although in everyday life it is common to speak to strangers of your age or younger using the singular pronoun. In addition, the informal second person singular is used even with older people you are acquainted with, depending on the level of mutual familiarity.\n\nSince the formal () has become less common outside schools and workplaces, many people often do not know which form to use (because using a formal version might sound too snobbish even to an elder and using the informal version might sound inappropriate to some strangers) and thus prefer to replace verbs with nouns (avoiding the dilemma) until enough information on the counterpart's intentions is gathered in order to choose between formal or informal second person pronoun and verb conjugation. A good rule of thumb is that singular accompanies first names and plural accompanies surnames with title (Mr, Mrs, etc.). Exceptions are rare, for example younger schoolchildren may address their teacher in the plural, title and \"first name\", or an officer may address a soldier in the singular and surname. The sequence singular-title-surname is a faux pas that can often indicate lack of education, of good manners, or of both.\n\nThe modern social custom when using Greek in Greece is to ask the other person \"may we speak in the singular?\" in which the other person is expected to answer \"yes\" and afterwards the discussion continues using the informal (); it is unthinkable for the other person to answer \"no\" or show preference for plural forms, and for this reason one should not even ask this question to a person of high status, such as a professional. Therefore, asking this question can itself be considered a form of disrespect in some social situations. Likewise, not asking this question and simply using the singular without prior explicit or implicit agreement would also be considered disrespectful in various social contingencies. In other cases, even using the formal plural (without a question) could also be considered offensive. A person being inappropriately addressed in the singular will often indicate their displeasure by insisting on responding in the plural, in a display of irony that may or may not be evident to the other party. A similar social custom exists with the words (Mr/Sir) and (Mrs/Madam), which can show both respect and a form of \"mock respect\" essentially communicating disapproval, often depending on the voice intonation and the social situation. Overall, the distinction between formal and informal forms of address and when to use each can be quite subtle and not easily discernible by a non-native speaker.\n\nCypriot Greek traditionally had no T–V distinction, with even persons of very high social status addressed in the singular, usually together with an honorific or title such as (\"teacher\", mainly for priests) or (literally \"master\", loosely \"sir\"). Even today, the singular form is used much more frequently in Cyprus compared to Greece, although this is changing under the influence of Standard Modern Greek. The plural form is now expected in a formal setting.\n\nIn Scottish Gaelic, the informal form of the second-person singular is / (emphatic: /), used when addressing a person the speaker knows well, or when addressing a person younger or relatively the same age as the speaker. When addressing a superior, an elder, or a stranger, or in conducting business, the form (emphatic: ) is used. ( is also the second person plural). This distinction carries over into prepositional pronouns: for instance, and (at you), and (against you), and (before you), etc., and into possessive pronouns and (your).\n\nIn Irish, the use of as an address to one person has died out, and is preferred. Formerly, Roman Catholic priests were addressed with the plural form , especially in Ulster, due to the possibility that the priest may be carrying the Eucharist on his person—belief in the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist would require the use of the plural.\n\nModern Welsh, Cornish and Breton all retain a T–V distinction to varying degrees.\n\nIn spoken Welsh, the plural pronoun is used when speaking to strangers, elders or superiors, while (or in some parts of the North) is used with friends, close family, animals and children. is also the form used when addressing God. Nonetheless, the use of and varies between families and regions, but those guidelines are generally observed.\n\nA similar distinction exists between Cornish singular / and plural / . The singular form is used when talking to friends, family, animals and children, and the plural form is used to talk to a group of people, or when being especially polite to one person.\n\nIn Breton the second person plural is used as a polite form when addressing a single person and the singular is reserved for informal situations. However, in a large area of central Brittany the singular form has been entirely replaced by , as in English.\n\nModern Russian distinguishes between the familiar ' () and the respectful ' (), the latter also being the plural of both forms. (Respectful () may be capitalised in written correspondence, while plural is not.) The distinction appeared relatively recently and began to gain currency among the educated classes in the 18th century through French influence.\n\nGenerally, is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults but are taught to address adults with . Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal but may transition to very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses to address B, then B also uses to address A. While people may transition quickly from to , such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult (or, in the case of opposite-sexed people, overly flirtatious), particularly if the other party maintains using .\n\nHistorically, the rules used to be more class-specific: as late as at the end of the 19th century, it was accepted in some circles (in aristocracy and especially gentry) that was to be used also between friends, between husband and wife, and when addressing one's parents (but not one's children), all of which situations today would strongly call for using . Meanwhile, up to this day, common people, especially those living in rural areas, hardly ever use the polite . Russian speakers online uphold the distinction and mainly use for strangers, although in the earlier days of internet it was more common and expected to use to address everyone.\n\nThe choice between and is closely related to, yet sometimes different from, the choice of the addressing format – that is, the selection from the first name, patronymics, last name, and the title to be used when addressing the person. Normally, is associated with the informal addressing by first name only (or, even more informally, by the patronymic only), whereas is associated with the more formal addressing format of using the first name together with patronymics (roughly analogous to \"title followed by last name\" in English) or the last name together with a title (the last name is almost never used together with either of the other two names to \"address\" someone, although such combinations are routinely used to \"introduce\" or \"mention\" someone). However, nowadays, can also be employed while addressing by first name only.\n\nIn Ukrainian, the present practice is essentially the same as in Russian, historically this was primarily in the Eastern, Russian-ruled part of Ukraine. Until about 1945, due to Polish influence, the practices in the former Galicia and Volyn regions, tended to more closely resemble the Polish practices, as described below. But since those areas became annexed to the Soviet Union, the East Ukrainian and Russian practices have become prevalent all over Ukraine, with the , , , etc. forms only being preserved in the émigré diaspora.\n\nIn all standard forms of Serbo-Croatian, i.e. Serbian, Croatian, Montenegrin and Bosnian, the use of is limited to friends and family, and used among children. In any formal use, , the second-person plural, is used only; can be used among peers in a workplace but is rare in official documents. It is a common misconception, even among native speakers, that is always capitalized when used in formal tone; is capitalized only in direct personal correspondence between two persons.\n\nWith the polite , masculine plural (in participles and adjectives) is used regardless of the sex of the person addressed.\n\nBulgarian distinguishes between familiar () and respectful (). is always singular and implies familiarity. , the plural of , also functions as the formal singular.\n\nIn addressing more than one person, the plural is always used. For example, \" means \"\"You\" two leave, please!\"). Here, although and both means \"you\", can not be used.\n\nWhen addressing a single person, if the people talking are acquainted then singular is used, otherwise plural should be used. Sometimes people start a new acquaintance straightforwardly with singular , but generally this is considered offensive, rude, or simply impolite. Children are taught to always use between themselves, but for addressing more than one child or an unknown adult.\n\nThe grammatically correct spelling of the singular word is always with a capital letter, whether being the first word in a sentence or not. For example, the sentence \"But \"you\" are wrong!\", if spelled (in Bulgarian) (the word with capital ), it would convey that the speaker is addressing an individual person with a plural, because he/she wants to express a polite, official manner; if spelt (the second possible Bulgarian translation of \"But \"you\" are wrong!\"), it would then mean that someone is talking to several persons.\n\nGenerally, is used among friends and relatives. When talking to each other, young people often start with the formal but quickly transition to in an informal situation. Unless there is a substantial difference in social situation (e.g. a teacher and a student), the choice of the form is symmetric: if A. uses to address B., then B. also uses to address A. While people may transition quickly from to , such transition presumes mutual agreement. There is a recent trend not to use the formal at all, but this can lead to awkward situations.\n\nMacedonian distinguishes between familiar () and respectful () – which is also the plural of both forms, used to address a pair or group. (Respectful may be capitalized, while plural is not.) Generally, is used among friends and relatives, but the usage depends not only on the closeness of the relationship but also on age and the formality of the situation (e.g., work meeting vs. a party). Children always use to address each other and are addressed in this way by adults, but are taught to address adults with . Younger adults typically also address older adults outside the family as regardless of intimacy, and may be addressed as in return. When talking to each other young people often start with the formal , but may transit to very quickly in an informal situation. Among older people, is often reserved for closer acquaintances. Unless there is a substantial difference in age, the choice of the form is symmetric: if A uses to address B, then B also uses to address A. While people may transit quickly from to , such transition presumes mutual agreement. Use of without consent of the other person is likely to be viewed as poor conduct or even as an insult, particularly if the other party maintains using .\n\nPolish uses as formal forms the words (meaning \"mister\" or \"gentleman\") and (\"lady\"), and in the plural (\"gentlemen\") and (\"ladies\") respectively, being used for mixed groups (originally a neutral noun, meaning roughly \"lordship\", but also, and until today, \"state\"). is used with the plural, like and . Because of their character as nouns (and not pronouns) these words are used with the third person: For example, the familiar (\"You want to drink\") becomes (literally \"The gentleman wants to drink\").\n\nFurther, and can be combined with the first name, the last name and with titles like \"President\", \"Professor\", \"Doctor\", \"Editor\" and others (, etc.; using these titles is considered necessary); using both (, ) is considered more polite or, in some context, even submissive. Addressing a present person with the last name is only usual in court or in other affairs, where government authority is involved, and generally considered impolite or condescending. When addressing someone, all these forms always require the vocative case, which is otherwise optional (for example (\"Mr Kowalski!\"), (\"Mrs Joanna!\"), (\"Professor!\")). For , etc. alone, + genitive is used instead of vocative: , , , and .\n\nA unique practice among both Poles and Western Ukrainians is addressing a lawyer as , meaning \"Mr. Philanthropist\", derived from the name of an ancient Greek king known for his generosity.\n\nThe V-forms are capitalized only in actual letters (or e-mails), where the T-forms and are also capitalized.\n\nPlural is also used as V-form in dialects, for example (\"Mother, what are you eating?\"). Following its Russian usage, the plural V-form was also promoted in the Polish language from 1945, becoming associated with Communist ideology and addressing of a person by a government or Party official.\n\nBesides, other forms can be sometimes used like in third person when talking to older family members (, \"May mother say\"), to clergy (, \"Yes, priest got it right\") or to other people in less formal or semi-formal situations, e.g. polite quarrel or dispute (, \"Also, may my dear friend please learn more and only then instruct others\").\n\nIn Slovenian, although informal address using the second person singular form (known as ) is officially limited to friends and family, talk among children, and addressing animals, it is increasingly used instead of its polite or formal counterpart using the second person plural form (known as ).\n\nThere is an additional nonstandard but widespread use of a singular participle combined with a plural auxiliary verb (known as ) that also reveals the gender of the person and is used in somewhat less formal situations:\n\n\nThe use of the third person plural form (known as in both direct address and indirect reference) as an ultra-polite form is now archaic or dialectal; it is associated with servant-master relationships in older literature, the child-parent relationship in certain conservative rural communities, and in general with relationships with people of highest respect (parents, clergy, royalty).\n\nIn Czech, there are three levels of formality. The most formal is using the second person plural verb forms (V form) with the surname or title of the addressed person, usual between strangers or people in a professional relationship. The second common form is made by using the second person singular verb forms (T form) together with the given name of the other person, used between friends and in certain social groups (students etc.). The third form, which is rather less common, is using the V form in combination with the given name. It may be used by a teacher when addressing a student (especially at the secondary school level), by a boss addressing their secretary, or in other relationships where a certain degree of familiarity has developed, but has not superseded some level of mutually acknowledged respect or distance. This form of address is usually asymmetrical (the perceived social superior uses V form in combination with the first name, the perceived social inferior using V form and the surname or honorific), less often symmetrical. Using the singular verb forms together with the surname or title is considered very rude. Where a stranger introduces themself with title (like , ), it is considered more polite to address them using the V form in combination with their title (always preceded by the honorific /, i.e. Mr/Ms), rather than their surname. However, it is considered poor manners to address somebody with their title in combination with the T form.\n\nTraditionally, use of the informal form was limited for relatives, very close friends, and for children. During the second half of the 20th century, use of the informal form grew significantly among coworkers, youth and members of organisations and groups. The formal form is always used in official documents and when dealing with a stranger (especially an older one) as a sign of respect. 2nd-person pronouns (, , , ) are often capitalized in letters, advertisement, etc. The capitalization is optional and is slowly becoming obsolete. A variant of the formal form modeled after German (/, /, verb ) was frequently used during the 19th century but has since disappeared. This form is also associated with Czech Jewish community before Second World War, and still appears very often in Jewish humour as sign of local colour. Sometimes it is used as irony.\n\nIn the Internet age, where people communicate under nicknames or pseudonymes and almost solely in informal way, capitalizing (/) is used to emphasise respect, or simply presence of respect. ( = friends, honored acquaintance, strangers = basic form, / = most formal, used to create distance or express contempt, very rude if not sufficiently advocated, often used as insult itself). \n\nIn grammar, plural forms are used in personal and possessive pronouns ( – you, – your) and in verbs, but not in participles and adjectives, they are used in singular forms (when addressing a single person). This differs from some other Slavic languages (Slovak, Russian, etc.)\n\nGreetings are also connected with T–V distinction. Formal (good day) and (good-bye) are used with formal , while , , (meaning both \"hello\", \"hi\", and \"bye\") are informal and used with .\n\nIn Lithuanian, historically, aside from familiar and respectful or , also used to express plural, there was a special form , mostly referred to in third person singular (although referring in second person singular is also not uncommon). This form was used to communicate with a stranger who has not earned particular respect (a beggar, for example). Modern Lithuanian Dictionary describes as a polite form of second singular person , making its meaning somewhere in the middle between informal and formal . Through the Soviet occupation period, however, this form was mostly replaced by standard neutral form (the vocative case for , \"comrade\", the latter being the standard formal form of addressing in all languages of the Soviet Union used in all situations, from \"comrade Stalin\" to \"comrade student\"), and by now is used sparsely. A common way of addressing people whom one doesn't know well is also (m) and (f), from Polish forms of address and , respectively.\n\nIn the standard forms of both Hindi and Urdu there are three levels of honorifics:\n\nBengali has three levels of formality in its pronouns; the most neutral forms of address among closer members of a family are and (plural). These two pronouns are also typically used when speaking to children, or to younger members of the extended family. is also used when addressing God. When speaking with adults outside the family, or with senior members of the extended family, the pronouns and (plural) are used. This is also true in advertisements and public announcements. A third set of pronouns, and (plural), is reserved for use between very close friends, and by extension, between relatives who share a bond not unlike a close friendship. It is also used when addressing people presumed to be of \"inferior\" social status; this latter use is occasionally used when speaking to housemaids, rickshaw-pullers, and other service workers, although this use is considered offensive.\n\nThe situations in which these different pronouns can be used vary considerably depending on many social factors. In some families, children may address their parents with and , although this is becoming increasingly rare. Some adults alternate between all three pronoun levels when speaking to children, normally choosing and , but also often choosing and to indicate closeness, or or in a joking manner. Additionally, Bengalis vary in which pronoun they use when addressing servants in the home; some may use and to indicate respect for an adult outside the family, while others may use and to indicate either inclusion into the family or to indicate somewhat less honorable status. Others may even use and to indicate inferior status.\n\nIn Finnish, today the use of the informal singular form of address () is widespread in all social circles, even among strangers and in business situations. The use of formal address has not disappeared however, and persists in situations involving customer service (especially if the customer is clearly older than the person serving them) and in general in addressing the elderly or in situations where strict adherence to form is expected, such as in the military. An increase in the use of formal address has been reported in recent years, whereby some people are choosing to use the formal form more often.. As the use of the form conveys formal recognition of the addressee's status and, more correctly, of polite social distance, the formal form might also occasionally be used jeeringly or to protest the addressee's snobbery. A native speaker may also switch to formal form when speaking in anger, as an attempt to remain civil. Advertisements, instructions and other formal messages are mostly in informal singular form ( and its conjugations), but the use of formal forms has increased in recent years. For example, as the tax authorities tend to become more informal, in contrast the social security system is reverting to using the formal form.\n\nThe same forms, such as the pronoun , are used for formal singular and for both formal and informal plural.\n\nIn Finnish the number is expressed in pronouns ( for second person singular, or for second person plural), verb inflections, and possessive suffixes. Almost all of these elements follow the grammar of the second person plural also in the formal singular form. For example, polite vs. informal , \"Could you move your car, (please)?\". Each of the person markers are modified: to (verb person), to (pronoun), to (possessive suffix).\n\nAs a few examples of this could be mentioned the way imperatives are expressed: \"Go!\" (plural), vs. \"Go!\" (singular), and the usage of the plural suffix \"your\" instead of the singular \"your\".\n\nThere is number agreement in Finnish, thus you say \"you are\" (singular), but \"you are\" (plural). However, this does not extend to words describing the addressee, which are in the singular, e.g. \"are you doctor?\" (plural, plural, singular)\n\nA common error, nowadays often made even by native speakers unused to the formal forms, is to use the plural form of the main verb in the perfect and pluperfect constructions. The main verb should be in the singular when addressing one person in the formal plural: instead of \"Have you heard?\"\n\nSometimes the third person is used as a polite form of address, after the Swedish model: \"What would madam like to have?\" This is far less common in the Eastern parts of Finland, influenced less by the Swedish language and all in all a declining habit. The passive voice may be used to circumvent the choice of the correct form of address. In another meaning, the passive voice is also the equivalent of the English patronizing \"we\" as in \"How are we feeling today?\"\n\nFinnish language includes the verbs for calling one with informal singular or formal plural: , , respectively.\n\nIn the Bible and in the Kalevala, only the \"informal\" singular is used in all cases.\n\nEstonian is a language with T–V distinction, second person plural () is used instead of second person singular () as a means of expressing politeness or formal speech. is the familiar form of address used with family, friends, and minors. The distinction is still much more widely used and more rigid than in closely related Finnish language.\n\nSimilar to the French language , the verb is used, and is used when addressing a (new) customer or a patient, or when talking to a person in his/her function. In hierarchical organizations, like large businesses or armies, is used between members of a same rank/level while is used between members of different ranks. (the verb is also used) is used with relatives, friends, when addressing children and with close colleagues. Borderline situations, such as distant relatives, young adults, customers in rental shops or new colleagues, sometimes still present difficulties.\n\nHungarian provides numerous, often subtle means of T–V distinction:\n\nThe use of the second-person conjugation with the pronoun (plural ) is the most informal mode. As in many other European languages, it is used within families, among children, lovers, close friends, (nowadays often) among coworkers, and in some communities, suggesting an idea of brotherhood. Adults unilaterally address children this way, and it is the form used in addressing God and other Christian figures (such as Jesus Christ or the Blessed Virgin), animals, and objects or ideas. Sociologically, the use of this form is widening. Whereas traditionally the switch to is often a symbolic milestone between people, sometimes sealed by drinking a glass of wine together (), today people under the age of about thirty will often mutually adopt automatically in informal situations. A notable example is the Internet: strangers meeting online use the informal forms of address virtually exclusively, regardless of age or status differences. \n\nNevertheless, formal forms of address are alive and well in Hungarian:\nIt is important to keep in mind that formal conjugation doesn't automatically imply politeness or vice versa; these factors are independent of each other. For example, \"What would you like to have?\" (literally, \"What do you command?\") is in the informal conjugation, while it can be extremely polite, making it possible to express one's honour towards people one has previously established a friendly relationship with. On the other hand, \"What do you want?\" is expressed with the formal conjugation, nevertheless it may sound rude and aggressive; the formal conjugation does not soften this tone in any way.\n\nIn modern Turkish, the T–V distinction is strong. Family members and friends speak to one another using the second-person singular , and adults use to address minors. In formal situations (business, customer–clerk, and colleague relationships, or meeting people for the first time) the plural second-person is used almost exclusively. In very formal situations, the double plural second-person may be used to address a much-respected person. Rarely, the third-person plural form of the verb (but not the pronoun) may be used to emphasize utmost respect. Additionally, if there are two or more person or could be used. For example, or have same meaning that \"You have been chosen\". However, are not certain whether plural or singular. It changes; formal speaking specifies one person or more but informal speaking it specifies only two or more person. In the imperative, there are four forms: second person singular for informal, second person plural for formal, and second person double plural for very formal situations: (second person singular, informal), (second person plural, formal), and (double second person plural, very formal). The very formal forms are not frequently used in spoken Turkish, but is pretty common in written directives, such as manuals and warning signs.\n\nUyghur is notable for using four different forms, to distinguish both singular and plural in both formal and informal registers. The informal plural originated as a contraction of , which uses a regular plural ending. In Old Turkic, as still in modern Turkish, () was the original second-person plural. However, in modern Uyghur () has become restricted to the formal singular, requiring the plural suffix for the plurals.\n\nIn the extinct Ubykh language, the T–V distinction was most notable between a man and his mother-in-law, where the plural form supplanted the singular very frequently, possibly under the influence of Turkish. The distinction was upheld less frequently in other relationships, but did still occur.\n\nModern Standard Arabic uses the majestic plural form of the second person ( ) in respectful address. It is restricted to highly formal contexts, generally relating to politics and government. However, several varieties of Arabic have a clearer T–V distinction. The most developed is in Egyptian Arabic, which uses (literally, \"Your Grace\"), and (literally, \"Your Lordship\") as the \"V\" terms, depending on context, while is the \"T\" term. is the most usual \"V\" term, with and being reserved for situations where the addressee is of very high social standing (e.g. a high-ranking government official or a powerful businessman). Finally, the \"V\" term is used only with social superiors (including elders); unfamiliar people perceived to be of similar or lower social standing to the speaker are addressed with the \"T\" term .\n\nIn modern Hebrew, there is a T–V distinction used in a set of very formal occasions, for example, a lawyer addressing a judge, or when speaking to rabbis. The second person singular (, masculine) or (, feminine) are the usual form of address in all other situations, e.g. when addressing ministers or members of the Knesset.\n\nThe formal form of address when speaking to a person of higher authority is the third person singular using the person's title without the use of the pronoun. Thus, a rabbi could be asked: (, \"would the honorable rabbi like to eat?\") or a judge told: (, \"his honour is considering my request\").\n\nOther persons of authority are normally addressed by their title only, rather than by name, using the second person singular. For example, officers and commanders in the army are addressed as (, \"the commander\") by troops.\n\nIn non-Hebrew-speaking Jewish culture, the second-person form of address is similarly avoided in cases of higher authority (e.g., a student in a yeshiva would be far more likely to say in a classroom discussion \"yesterday the Rav told us...\" than \"yesterday you told us...\"). However, this usage is limited to more conservative (i.e. Orthodox) circles.\n\nIn Tamil, the second-person singular pronoun நீ and its derived forms are used to address children, (younger or very close) members of the family and to people who are younger than the speaker. The second person plural pronoun நீங்கள் is used to address elders (also within the extended family), teachers, people who are older than the speaker and anyone whom the speaker does not personally know, especially in formal situations.\n\nChinese culture has taken naming and forms of address very seriously, strictly regulating which people were permitted to use which terms in conversation or in writing. The extreme example is the 1777 execution of Wang Xihou and his entire family and the confiscation of their entire estate as his penalty for writing the Qianlong Emperor's personal name as part of a criticism of the Kangxi Dictionary. Many honorifics and niceties of address fell by the wayside during the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s amid Mao Zedong's campaign against the \"Four Olds\". This included an attempt to eradicate expressions of deference to teachers and to others seen as preserving \"counter-revolutionary\" modes of thought. The defeat of the Maoist Gang of Four in the late 1970s and continuing reforms since the 1980s has, however, permitted a return of such traditional and regional expressions.\n\nHistorically, the T–V distinction was observed among the Chinese by avoiding \"any\" use of common pronouns in addressing a respected audience. Instead, third-person honorifics and respectful titles were employed. One aspect of such respectful address was avoiding the use of the \"first\"-person pronoun as well, instead choosing a (typically humble) epithet in its place. The extreme of this practice occurred when Shi Huangdi abrogated the then-current first-person pronoun (\"zhèn\"); the present first-person pronoun (\"wǒ\") subsequently developed out of the habit of referring to \"this [worthless] body\", the character's original meaning. An important difference between the T–V distinction in Chinese compared with modern European languages is that Chinese culture considers the relative age of the speakers an important aspect of their social distance. This is especially strong within families: while the speakers of European languages may generally prefer forms of address such as \"father\" or \"grandpa\", Chinese speakers consider using the personal names of elders such a taboo that they may not even \"know\" the given names of grandparents who live in the same apartment. While strictures against writing the personal name of any ancestor of the last seven generations are no longer observed, it remains very uncommon to name children for any living relative: younger people using the name freely would disrespect the original bearer.\n\nIn the present day, the informal second-person pronoun is (Mandarin: \"nǐ\"; Minnan: \"lí\") and the honorific pronoun is (Mandarin: \"nín\"; Minnan: \"lín\"). Much like European languages, the honorific form developed out of an earlier second-person plural: during the Jin and Yuan dynasties, the Mandarin dialects mutated (\"nǐměi\") into (\"nǐmen\") and then into . (A similar form , \"tān\" developed for the third-person singular but is now generally unused.) It is worth noting that the T–V distinction in Mandarin does \"not\" connote a distance or lack of intimacy between the speakers (as implied, e.g., in the French \"vous\"). On the contrary, it is often noted that the respectful form contains the radical for \"heart\" (, \"xīn\"); although this is actually for phonetic reasons, the implication is that the addressee is loved and cherished by the speaker.\n\nMost southern dialects, however, do not make this distinction in speech at all. Cantonese and Shanghainese speakers learn to \"write\" both forms in school but pronounce them identically: the Cantonese as \"nei\" and the Shanghainese as \"nóng\". Formality is still respected, but their languages like Japanese and Vietnamese retain the earlier Chinese tradition of employing epithets or honorifics instead of using any pronouns at all when showing formal respect.\n\nUnder heavy Chinese influence, traditional Japanese culture eschewed the use of common pronouns in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular (, \"chin\") was arrogated to the personal use of the emperor. The formality of Japanese culture was such that its original pronouns have largely ceased to be used at all. Some linguists therefore argue that Japanese lacks \"any\" pronouns whatsoever, but although it is a larger and more complex group of words than most languages employ Japanese pronouns do exist, having developed out of the most common epithets used to express different relationships and relative degrees of social status. As in Korean, polite language encompasses not only these specific pronouns but also suffixes and vocabulary as well.\n\nMost commonly, (, \"kimi\",  \"prince\", \"lord\") is used informally as the second-person singular and (, \"anata\", \"dear one\") is the most common polite equivalent, but is also commonly used by women towards an intimate as a term of endearment. The pronoun (, \"kisama\") is illustrative of the complexity that can be involved, though, in that its literal meaning is quite flattering \"dear and honorable sir\" but its ironic use has made it a strong insult in modern Japanese. Similarly, (, \"omae\") \"(one who is) before (me)\" was traditionally a respectful pronoun used toward aristocrats and religious figureheads, but today is considered very informal and impolite, yet also commonly used by husbands towards their wives in an endearing manner.\n\nUnder heavy Chinese influence, Vietnamese culture has eschewed the use of common pronouns in formal speech; similarly, the Chinese first-person singular (Vietnamese: \"trẫm\") was arrogated to the personal use of the emperor.\n\nIn modern Vietnamese, only the first-person singular \"tôi\" is in common use as a respectful pronoun; any other pronoun should be replaced with the subject's name or with an appropriate epithet, title, or relationship in polite formal speech. Similar to modern Chinese (but to a much greater extent), modern Vietnamese also frequently replaces \"informal\" pronouns with kinship terms in many situations. The somewhat insulting second-person singular \"mày\" is also frequently used in informal situations among young Vietnamese.\n\nIn Thai, first, second, and third person pronouns vary in formality according to the social standing of the speaker and the referent and the relationship between them. For a non-exhaustive list of Thai second person pronouns, see http://www.into-asia.com/thai_language/grammar/you.php.\n\nIn Indonesian, the T–V distinction is extremely important; addressing a stranger with the pronoun \"kau\" or \"kamu\" (you) is considered rude and impolite (unless the stranger is, for example, a child). When addressing a stranger or someone older, typically \"Bu\" ('ma'am') or \"Pak\" ('sir') is used. People also use \"mas\" (Javanese for 'older brother') or \"mbak\" (Javanese for 'older sister') when addressing someone that is not old enough to be called \"Bu\" or \"Pak\". There are variations in different areas. If the situation is more formal, such as in meetings or news broadcasting, \"Anda\" is always used, even if those addressed would otherwise be addressed by \"kau\" or \"kamu\" in informal situations. A more informal pronoun, written \"lu\", \"lo\", or sometimes as \"loe\" (originated from Hokkien language) is considered very impolite. This is normally used by teenagers (particularly in urban centers) to their peers. Adults can sometimes be heard using this pronoun with their close friends or when they are angry.\n\n\nSimilarly, \"kalian\" dan \"Anda\"/\"Anda sekalian\" are used.\n\nIn Tagalog, the familiar second person is \"ikáw/ka\" (in the nominative case). This is replaced by \"kayó\" (which is actually the second person plural) when the situation calls for a more polite tone. The pronoun \"kayó\" is accompanied by the particle \"pô\". This form is generally used to show respect to close, older relatives. This is also the form expected when talking with the peers of parents or grandparents.\n\nTraditionally, when a higher degree of formality is required, the third person plural (\"silá\") is used instead. It is used when addressing people of higher social rank, such as government officials and senior clergymen. It may also be used when speaking to complete strangers as a matter of courtesy, such as when answering the door or an unknown caller.\n\n\nYounger Filipinos tend to mix these forms of address, resulting in questions such as \"Sino ka pô ba?\" in an attempt to sound polite towards a total stranger. This and other nonstandard variants are very widespread, especially in the Manila dialect of Tagalog and its surrounding suburbs.\n\nBasque has two levels of formality in every dialect, which are hi and zu; Nevertheless, in some areas of Gipuzkoa and Biscay, the respectful form berori is still used by some speakers, just as the familiar xu in some areas of the Eastern Low Navarrese dialect, when addressing children and close friends. Most speakers only use the \"zu\" form (\"zuka\" level) and that is the usual one used in methods, slogans... although the \"hi\" form (\"hika\") is very common in villages.\n\nThe neutral or formal one is \"zu\", which originally used to be the plural form of the second person. The informal one is \"hi\", whose use is limited to some specific situations: among close friends, to children (children never use it when addressing their parents, neither the spouses among them), when talking to a younger person, to animals (cattle, pets...), in monologues, and when speaking angrily to somebody. Their common plural form is \"zuek\", whenever the speaker is talking to a group of listeners who would all be individually addressed with the form \"zu\", or the form \"hi\", or both (a conversation where some listeners are addressed as \"zu\" —i.e., somebody's parents, for instance— and others as \"hi\" —the speaker's siblings—).\n\nUnlike \"zu\", \"hi\" sometimes makes a distinction whether the addressed one is a male or a female. For example: \"duk\" (thou, male, hast) and \"dun\" (thou, female, hast). The use of the hika level requires the allocutive agreement (\"hitano\" or \"zeharkako hika\", i.e., indirect \"hika\") in non-subordinate sentences to mark this distinction for the first and third person verbs. Those allocutive forms are found in the Indicative and Conditional moods, but never in the Subjunctive and Imperative moods, with the one exception of \"goazemak\" (let's go, said to a male) and \"goazeman\" (said to a female) in Western dialects, opposed to \"goazen\", the neutral form. For example:\n\n\nNevertheless, if any of the allocutive sentences becomes subordinate, the formal one is used: \"aitak ikasi duelako\" (because Dad has learned it), \"aitak erosi diolako\" (because Dad bought it for him / her), and \"hona etorri nintzenean\" (when I came here).\n\nOn the other hand, in past tense verbal forms, no distinction is made when the addressee is the subject or the direct object in the sentence. For example:\n\n\nBut if the familiar second-person appears in the verb, or if the verb is an allocutive form in a non-dependent clause, the masculine and feminine forms differ. For example:\n\n\nThe friendly \"xu\" form or xuketa resembles the \"zuka\" forms of the verbs, and includes another kind of allocutive, as \"hika\": cf. \"egia erran dut\" (formal: I told the truth), \"egia erran diat\" (informal, said to a male), \"egia erran dinat\" (informal, said to a female), \"egia erran dautzut\" (in formal Eastern Low Navarrese, I told \"you\" the truth) and \"egia erran dixut\" (\"xuketa\"). It is mainly used among relatives and close friends.\n\nThe \"berori\" form or berorika is very formal, and hardly used nowadays, mainly in some areas of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, to address priests, the elderly, judges and the nobility. Verbs are inflected in their singular third form, like in Italian (\"(Lei) è molto gentile\", opposed to \"(tu) sei molto gentile\", you are very nice / thou art very nice) or the Spanish \"(usted) es muy amable\", opposed to \"(tú) eres muy amable\":\n\n\nUnlike the \"hika\" level, \"berorika\" has no allocutive forms.\n\nThe extinct dialect of Erronkari or Roncal, spoken in the easternmost area of Navarre, presented a four-levelled system:\n\n\nEsperanto is a T–V-distinguishing language, but usually \"vi\" is used for both singular and plural, just like \"you\" in modern English. An informal second person singular pronoun, \"ci\", indeed exists, but it is rarely used in practice. It is mainly intended to make the familiar/respectful distinction when translating (literature, for example) from languages that do have the T–V distinction.\n\nSome have imagined \"ci\" as an archaic term that was used before and then fell out of common usage; however, this is not true. It has appeared only sometimes in experimental language. In standard Esperanto, \"vi\" has always been used since the beginning. For example, \"ci\" appears in neither the \"Fundamenta Gramatiko\" nor the \"Unua Libro\". But, especially in some circles, people have begun to use \"ci\" in practical language, mainly as the familiar and intimate singular, reserving \"vi\" for the plural and formal singular. Others use \"ci\" as singular and \"vi\" as plural regardless of formality.\n\nIn Ido, in theory \"tu\" is limited to friends and family, whereas \"vu\" is used anywhere else. However, many users actually adapt the practice in their own mother tongue and use \"tu\" and \"vu\" accordingly. In the plural, though, the only form in use is \"vi\", which does not distinguish between formal and informal address.\n\nIn all cases, an -n is added to the original pronoun to indicate a direct object that precedes its own verb: \"Me amoras tu\" (I love you) becomes \"Tun me amoras\" if the direct object takes the first place, for example for emphatic purposes.\n\nIn High Elvish, self-named Quenya, there is a distinction between singular informal \"tyë\" and singular formal \"lyë\". The plural of both forms is \"lë\". The formal form is expected between all but family members and close friends. The appendices to \"Lord of the Rings\" state that Westron followed a similar pattern, although the dialect of Shire had largely lost the formal form.\n\nSome languages have a verb to describe the fact of using either a \"T\" or a \"V\" form. Some also have a related noun or pronoun. The English words are used to refer only to English usage in the past, not to usage in other languages. The analogous distinction may be expressed as \"to use first names\" or \"to be on familiar terms (with someone)\".\n"}

She received a certificate of achievement signed by LeVar Burton after submitting the first story she wrote to the Reading Rainbow Young Writers and Illustrators Contest, which encouraged her, and after reading Toni Morrison's \"Song of Solomon\" while attending Grissom High School at the age of 17, she was inspired to choose a career in writing.\n\nShe earned a Bachelor of Arts in English at Stanford, and a Master of Fine Arts from the Iowa Writers' Workshop, a creative writing program at the University of Iowa.\n\nShortly after graduating from Stanford, she began her debut novel and worked at a startup company in San Francisco, but she did not enjoy the work and resigned after she was accepted to Iowa in 2012.\n\nHer debut novel \"Homegoing\" was inspired by a 2009 trip to Ghana, Gyasi's first since leaving the country as an infant. The novel was completed in 2015, and after initial readings from publishers, was met with numerous offers before she accepted a seven-figure advance from Knopf. Ta-Nehisi Coates selected \"Homegoing\" for the National Book Foundation's 2016 \"5 under 35\" award, and the novel also was selected for the National Book Critics Circle's John Leonard Award, the PEN/Hemingway award for best first book, and the American Book Award for contributions to diversity in American literature.\n\nHer writing has also appeared in such publications as \"African American Review\", \"Callaloo\", \"Guernica\" \"The Guardian\", and \"Granta\".\n\nGyasi cites Toni Morrison (\"Song of Solomon\"), Gabriel García Márquez (\"One Hundred Years of Solitude\"), James Baldwin (\"Go Tell It on the Mountain\"), Edward P. Jones (\"Lost in the City\"), and Jhumpa Lahiri (\"Unaccustomed Earth\") as inspirations.\n\n, Gyasi lives in Berkeley, California.\n\n\n\n"}
