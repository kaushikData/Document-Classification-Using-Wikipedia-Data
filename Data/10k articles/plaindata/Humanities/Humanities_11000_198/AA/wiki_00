The title of the book comes from a comment made by British Lieutenant General Frederick Browning, deputy commander of the First Allied Airborne Army, who told Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery before the operation, \"I think we may be going a bridge too far.\"\n\nDrawing on a wide variety of sources, Ryan also documented his account of the 1944 battle with pictures and maps and included a section on the survivors, “Soldiers and Civilians – What They Do Today”. One particular focus was on the tactical mistakes made in planning the operation. Until Ryan's book, Market Garden had been a classic example of victors writing the history. Popular accounts of World War II usually tended not to mention the battle at all or put Montgomery's spin on it as being a \"partial success\".\n\nThe 1974 book was published by Simon & Schuster in New York and by Hamish Hamilton in London. There were frequent later editions, and a film based on it was released in 1977.\n"}

She was noted for her work with her husband George Horsfield at Petra and Kilwa, and produced detailed studies of the history of her father's castle, Allington, in Kent which had been owned by the Wyatt family in the 16th century.\n\nAgnes Conway was born on 2 May 1885 to William Martin Conway and Katrina Conway (née Lombard).\nShe attended Baker Street High School and Kings College before becoming a student at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1903. She studied for a History Tripos while also having tutorials in Greek from Jane Ellen Harrison, then Lecturer in Classical Archaeology at Newnham. Her father bought Allington Castle in Kent in 1905, and began a lengthy restoration of the castle in the following years.\nAgnes passed both parts of her \"History Tripos\" by 1907 and continued her tutorials in Greek with Harrison with a view to studying archaeology. She added to and catalogued her father's growing collection of photographs, working with Eugenie Sellers Strong at the British School at Rome in 1912 on this project. Admitted as a student of the British School at Athens for the 1913/1914 session, she travelled widely in Greece and the Balkans in 1914 with a friend, Evelyn Radford, who had also attended Newnham. Conway published an account of the journey, entitled \"A Ride Through the Balkans, on Classic Ground with a Camera\" in 1917.\n\nFrom 1917-1929, Conway worked on gathering materials representing women's work in the First World War as the chair of the Women's Work Sub-Committee of the newly established Imperial War Museum. Her father, Martin Conway, had been appointed the honorary Director-General of the Museum. She also attended classes at the Institute of Historical Research, where she studied the relationship of Henry VII with Scotland and Ireland, for which she was awarded an M. A. degree from the University of London. For this project she spent much time at the British Museum Reading Room and the Public Records Office.\n\nConway visited Petra for the first time in 1928, accompanying family friends on an extensive trip through Egypt, Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq. Struck by its beauty, she went back to Allington determined to do further research and write up her journey for publication. She contacted George Horsfield, Chief Inspector of Antiquities for the Transjordan Government, in order to find out more about the site; eventually becoming part of a team of archaeologists, including Horsfield, Tawfiq Canaan, a Palestinian physician, and Dr Detlief Nielsen, from Copenhagen, to explore Petra in detail in March 1929. Conway lectured on Petra at the Royal Geographical Society in 1930. She kept in touch with Horsfield over the results of the excavation, and the two developed a close relationship, resulting in their marriage in St George's Cathedral, Jerusalem, on 29 January 1932.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20104627", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20104627", "title": "Archaeoparasitology", "text": "Archaeoparasitology\n\nArchaeoparasitology, a multi-disciplinary field within paleopathology, is the study of parasites in archaeological contexts. It includes studies of the protozoan and metazoan parasites of humans in the past, as well as parasites which may have affected past human societies, such as those infesting domesticated animals.\n\nReinhard suggested that the term \"archaeoparasitology\" be applied to \"... all parasitological remains excavated from archaeological contexts ... derived from human activity\" and that \"the term 'paleoparasitology' be applied to studies of nonhuman, paleontological material.\" (p. 233) Paleoparasitology includes all studies of ancient parasites outside of archaeological contexts, such as those found in amber, and even dinosaur parasites.\n\nThe first archaeoparasitology report described calcified eggs of \"Bilharzia haematobia\" (now \"Schistosoma haematobium\") from the kidneys of an ancient Egyptian mummy. Since then, many fundamental archaeological questions have been answered by integrating our knowledge of the hosts, life cycles and basic biology of parasites, with the archaeological, anthropological and historical contexts in which they are found.\n\nParasites are organisms which live in close association with another organism, called the host, in which the parasite benefits from the association, to the detriment of the host. Many other kinds of associations may exist between two closely allied organisms, such as commensalism or mutualism.\n\nEndoparasites (such as protozoans and helminths), tend to be found inside the host, while ectoparasites (such as ticks, lice and fleas) live on the outside of the host body. Parasite life cycles often require that different developmental stages pass sequentially through multiple host species in order to successfully mature and reproduce. Some parasites are very host-specific, meaning that only one or a few species of hosts are capable of perpetuating their life cycle. Others are not host-specific, since many different hosts appear to harbor and pass on the infective stages of the parasite.\n\nMost archaeoparasitology reports involve species which are considered to be true parasites of humans today. However, incidental parasitism (referred to by some authors as \"pseudoparasitism\", \"false parasitism\" or \"accidental parasitism\") occurs when a parasite which does not normally utilize a host for the perpetuation of its lifecycle is found in that host incidentally. One example is finding the eggs of \"Cryptocotyle lingua\" (a fish parasite) in the stomach contents of an Eskimo mummy. It is estimated that 70% of the \"parasite\" species reported from present-day humans are actually only incidental parasites. Some incidental parasites do cause harm to the infested pseudohosts.\n\nIn archaeological contexts, endoparasites (or their eggs or cysts) are usually found in (i) fossilized human or animal dung (coprolites), (ii) the tissues and digestive contents of mummified corpses, or (iii) soil samples from latrines, cesspits, or middens (dumps for domestic waste). A cyst of \"Echinococcus granulosus\" was even retrieved from cemetery soil in Poland. Ectoparasites may be found on the skin or scalp, as well as wigs, clothing, or personal grooming accessories found in archaeological sites. Ectoparasite eggs may be found attached to individual hairs. The International Ancient Egyptian Mummy Tissue Bank in Manchester, England, provides tissue samples for a variety of uses, including parasitological studies.\n\nSince 1910, parasite remains have been found in archaeological samples from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and New Zealand. The age of archaeological sites yielding human parasite remains ranges from approx. 25,000-30,000 years ago to late 19th-early 20th century. Parasite remains have also been found in domestic animal remains at archaeological sites.\n\nHuman skeletal remains may exhibit indirect evidence of parasitism. For example, hookworm (\"Ancyslostoma duodenale\") parasitism may lead to anemia, and anemia is one factor associated with the skeletal changes of cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis. Thus, hookworm parasitism \"may\" be a causal factor in observed cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis, though dietary factors may also lead to anemia.\n\nInformation on the presence of intermediate hosts, required for life cycle completion by many parasites, is also useful in determining the likelihood that a parasite may have infected a particular ancient society. One example is the identification of molluscan intermediate hosts of schistosomiasis in an Islamic archaeological context.\n\nArtifacts depicting the appearance of individuals may also indicate cases of parasitism. Examples include the characteristic facial deformities of leishmaniasis found on pre-Columbian Mochica pottery, and morphological features of certain ancient Egyptian figurative art. Literary sources also provide valuable information regarding not only the parasites present in historic societies, but also the knowledge and attitudes that the people had towards their parasitic infestations. However, specific parasitological diagnoses reported in ancient and medieval texts must always be read with some degree of skepticism.\n\nParasite remains in archaeological samples are identified by a variety of techniques. Very durable remains, such as eggs and cysts, may remain intact for many thousands of years. In some cases, relatively intact soft-bodied adult helminths and ectoparasitic arthropods have been found. All of these forms can be identified to the family, genus or species level by compound or electron microscopy. \nPetrographic techniques have been used for eggs of \"Capillaria hepatica\" found in cysts in the corpse of an adolescent from the late Roman period buried in Amiens (France). The authors stated that identification of tissue-dwelling parasites such as \"Capillaria hepatica\" in archaeological remains is particularly dependent on preservation conditions and taphonomic changes and should be interpreted with caution due to morphological similarities with \"Trichuris\" sp. eggs\n\nIn cases where the intact bodies of parasites are not found, protein or DNA from the parasite may still be present. Antigenic and immunological assays (including enzyme-linked immunoassay - ELISA,), and DNA sequencing are used to identify the source of these chemical remains, often to the species level.\n\nArchaeoparasitological studies have provided information on many fundamental archaeological, historical, and biogeographical questions. These questions may be grouped into the following broad categories: past dietary and farming practices, animal domestication, migration patterns, climate change, sanitary practices, cultural contacts, ethnomedicine, and the overall health of various human societies. Archaeoparasitology data, combined with our knowledge of present host-parasite associations, also contributes to our understanding of the co-evolution of human host-parasite interactions. Our understanding of the geographic origins, evolution and biogeography of the parasites themselves and human diseases associated with them has also benefitted tremendously from archaeoparasitological studies.\n"}
{"id": "46903563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46903563", "title": "Blair Witch", "text": "Blair Witch\n\nBlair Witch is a horror film franchise distributed by Artisan Entertainment (now Lionsgate) and produced by Haxan Films that consists of three feature films and various merchandise products. The development of the franchise's first installment, \"The Blair Witch Project\", started in 1993. The filmmakers Eduardo Sánchez and Daniel Myrick wrote a 35-page outline of a story with the dialogue to be improvised. Filming began in 1997 and lasted eight days. The film follows the disappearance of three student filmmakers in the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland while shooting a documentary on the local legend known as the \"Blair Witch\".\n\nAfter premiering at the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, the film was released on 30 July 1999 after months of publicity during a controversial promotional campaign. The film went on to be a massive commercial success, and a sequel, \"\", was released on October 27, 2000. A second official sequel, \"Blair Witch\", was released on September 16, 2016. Series of video games, books, novels and comic books were released to accompany the films.\n\nThe backstory for the movie is a faux legend fabricated by Sánchez and Myrick which is detailed in \"The Curse of the Blair Witch\", a mockumentary broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel in 1999 prior to the release of \"The Blair Witch Project\". Sanchez and Myrick also maintained a website at BlairWitch.com which added further details to the legend. It is now the official site of the 2016 installment.\n\nThe fictional tale describes the murders and disappearances of some of the residents of Blair, Maryland (the fictitious former name of Burkittsville, Maryland) from the 18th century to the 20th century. According to the legend, residents always blame these occurrences on the ghost of Elly Kedward (also a fictitious person), a Blair resident executed in 1785 by exposure for practicing witchcraft. The mockumentary presents the legend as real, complete with manufactured newspaper articles, newsreels, television news reports, and staged interviews, all in an attempt to deceive viewers.\n\nHeather Donahue, Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard, student filmmakers, set out to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch. In the Black Hills forest near Burkittsville, Maryland, many children have vanished in the 1940s and people still avoid going too deep into the woods. The party sets out to look for facts that prove the legend, equipped only with two cameras and a little hiking gear. First, they find little piles of stone that must have been arranged artificially, later, they find themselves lost in the woods. Eerie sounds at night and more piles of stones in places where they have not been before cause the already desperate group to panic. One night, days after they should have been back home, Josh disappears. While searching for Josh, Heather and Mike find a derelict house in a clearing and go inside, where they see runic symbols on the wall next to child-sized handprints. Josh's voice seems to be coming from somewhere inside the house, and Mike rushes upstairs. Mike then realizes that the voice is now coming from the basement, and rushes down the steps. Suddenly, Mike is rendered silent and the camera falls. Hysterical, Heather follows and sees Mike in the corner of the room, faced against a wall. Suddenly Heather's camera is knocked down and she too is rendered silent. The film runs for a few seconds, then dies.\n\n\"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" returns to Maryland's Black Hills region in the wake of \"The Blair Witch Project\" and the prodigious media coverage devoted to its conflation of documentary style and supernatural legend, fans and curiosity-seekers have descended upon the movie's real-life setting of Burkittsville, Maryland. Jeff Patterson (Jeffrey Donovan), a black-sheep \"townie\" only recently released from a mental institution, has turned his obsession with the Blair Witch into a business and has lured four young people to Burkittsville for a tour of the Witch's purported Black Hills' haunts. Jeff's clients are also fixated on the film, for reasons they themselves may not fully comprehend. Erica Geerson (Erica Leerhsen) is a practicing Wiccan who has immersed herself in Blair Witch mythology, even though she decries the film's portrayal of her fellow witches. Grad students Tristen Ryler (Tristine Skyler) and Stephen Ryan Parker (Stephen Barker Turner) are writing a book about the Blair Witch, but disagree completely about the story's basis in fact, with folklorist Tristen arguing that it must contain some grain of truth while Stephen insists it's a textbook case of mass hysteria. Completing the group is Kim Diamond (Kim Director), a hard-edged, sardonic Goth aficionado possessed of striking psychic abilities.\n\nAfter spending a strange and disorienting night at one of the most sinister sites in Blair Witch lore, the five campers awake to a scene of destruction and no memory of having gone to sleep. They return to Jeff's abandoned warehouse loft to try to piece together what happened. But as Jeff leads Erica, Tristen, Stephen and Kim across the rickety drawbridge and unlocks the metal door to a chorus of barking dogs, they are entering a place no safer than the woods they just left. Inside, the legend seems to begin to bleed into reality as their mass hysteria ensues. Erica mysteriously disappears and Tristen ends up hanging herself from the second floor railing of the warehouse.\n\nThe end of the film reveals that Jeff, Stephen, and Kim have been arrested. Each is interrogated separately, with the police showing each person footage of their crimes. Security camera footage shows Kim stabbing a cashier in the neck. Surveillance camera footage shows a naked Jeff killing Erica, arranging her clothes, and putting her dead body in the closet. Jeff's video shows Stephen assaulting Tristen, pushing her over the second floor banister, and accusing her of being a witch. All three, close to a nervous breakdown, proclaim their innocence.\n\nThe tie-in mockumentary to \"\", \"Shadow of the Blair Witch\", establishes the events of the film being a film within a film; the in-universe mockumentary reveals that \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" is \"a film adaptation\" based on the \"Black Hills murders\" that took place shortly after the release of \"The Blair Witch Project\". \"Shadow of the Blair Witch\" follows \"the real James Patterson\"'s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to fictionalize the case's events for the big screen from the defense's point-of-view. Protests of the film \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" are discussed within the documentary coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the Wiccan community as a whole. Rachel Moskowitz and Andre Brooks respectively portray the \"real\" Kim Diamond and Jeffrey Patterson within the documentary.\n\nOn September 2, 2009, Ed Sánchez and Daniel Myrick announced their intent to produce a third \"Blair Witch\" film. The film was a sequel to the first film, would potentially contain the actors from the first film in some context, and would not reference any of the events from \"Book of Shadows\". In 2011, Sánchez remarked that further development on a sequel depended on getting Lionsgate to approve the idea and for his and Myrick's schedule to match up. The film went into development hell.\n\nBy January 2015, a third \"Blair Witch\" was still in talks. Sanchez stated that the film was \"inevitable\".\n\nIn July 2016, it was revealed at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con that the film marketed with the faux-title \"The Woods\", actually turned out to be the sequel \"Blair Witch\". The film was released on September 16, 2016.\n\nFour mockumentaries on the \"Blair Witch\" were produced to promote the films. The first being \"Curse of the Blair Witch\" which aired on the Syfy Channel in 1999, prior to the release of \"The Blair Witch Project\", and the second being \"Sticks and Stones: An Exploration of the Blair Witch Legend\" which overlaps quite a bit with \"Curse of the Blair Witch\". The latter two documentaries, \"The Massacre of The Burkittsville 7: The Blair Witch Legacy\" and \"Shadow of the Blair Witch\", both directed by Ben Rock, aired in 2000.\n\nBefore the release of \"The Blair Witch Project\" in 1999, the Sci-Fi Channel aired a 45-minute mockumentary about the Blair Witch called \"Curse of the Blair Witch\".\n\nThe program offers firsthand interviews with several fictional colleagues and relatives of Heather Donahue, Josh Leonard and Michael Williams, including their Montgomery College film professor.\n\nOne of the highlights of the video is the first mention of Elly Kedward, the woman who would go on to become the Blair Witch.\n\n\"Curse of the Blair Witch\" was created to give credibility to the idea that the events of \"The Blair Witch Project\" actually occurred, which was how the film was marketed upon its initial release.\n\nDirected by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, considered for inclusion in the theatrical release of \"The Blair Witch Project\" and released to VHS as part of a special promotion that ran when \"The Blair Witch Project\" was released on home video, \"Sticks and Stones\" runs 30 minutes and overlaps with the mockumentary \"Curse of the Blair Witch\". The mockumentary primarily consists of alternate cuts of many of the previous films' interviews, but there is some new material to be found, including a brief 1995 conversation with Joshua Leonard's father about his son's disappearance.\n\n\"Sticks and Stones\" also includes an extended conversation between Heather Donahue and Michael Williams from a deleted scene, that was cut from the theatrical release of \"The Blair Witch Project\".\n\nWhen \"The Blair Witch Project\" premiered on Showtime, it was accompanied by a new 40-minute Blair Witch mockumentary named \"The Burkittsville 7\", which delved into the murder case of Rustin Parr that was mentioned in \"The Blair Witch Project\". Within the mockumentary it is theorised that Kyle Brody, the lone survivor of the murders, may have himself been involved in the murders. Within the mockumentary, it is mentioned that after Parr was hanged, Brody grew up to become a troubled adult who spent most of the latter part of his life in mental institutions before committing suicide in the year 1971.\n\nDirected by Ben Rock, and airing on the Sci-Fi Channel in conjunction with the release of \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\", the mockumentary \"Shadow of the Blair Witch\" takes an objective look at the events of \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\". Running 45 minutes, it examines the troubled life of \"the real Jeff Patterson\" and his obsession with \"The Blair Witch Project\". Within the documentary, the events of \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" are presented as a film adaptation based on the \"Black Hills murders\" that took place shortly after the events of \"The Blair Witch Project\". This documentary presents \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" as a film within a film.\n\n\"Shadow of the Blair Witch\" follows \"the real James Patterson\"'s defense team as the case prepares for trial and as the public reacts to plans to . Protests of the film \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\" are discussed coming from both the families of those involved with the case and from the Wiccan community as a whole.\n\nList indicator(s)\n\n\nIn September 1999, D.A. Stern compiled \"The Blair Witch Project: A Dossier\". Perpetuating the film's \"true story\" angle, the dossier consisted of fabricated police reports, pictures, interviews, and newspaper articles presenting the movie's premise as fact, as well as further elaboration on the Elly Kedward and Rustin Parr legends. \"Blair Witch: Book of Shadows\" was released in November, 2000.\n\nStern wrote the 2000 novel \"Blair Witch: The Secret Confessions of Rustin Parr\" and in 2004, revisited the franchise with the novel \"Blair Witch: Graveyard Shift\", featuring all original characters and plot.\n\nIn May 1999, a Photonovel adaptation of \"The Blair Witch Project\" was written by Claire Forbes and was released by Fotonovel Publications.\n\nA series of eight young adult books entitled \"The Blair Witch Files\" were released by Random subsidiary Bantam from 2000 to 2001. The books center on Cade Merill, a fictional cousin of Heather Donahue, who investigates phenomena related to the Blair Witch in attempt to discover what really happened to Heather, Mike, and Josh.\n\n\nIn August 1999, Oni Press released a one-shot comic promoting the first film, simply titled \"The Blair Witch Project\". Written by Jen Van Meter and drawn by Bernie Mireault, Guy Davis, and Tommy Lee Edwards, the comic featured three short stories elaborating on the mythology of the Blair Witch. In mid-2000, the same group worked on a four-issue series called \"The Blair Witch Chronicles\".\n\nIn October 2000, coinciding with the release of \"Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2\", Image Comics released a one-shot called \"Blair Witch: Dark Testaments\", drawn by Charlie Adlard and written by Ian Edginton.\n\nIn 2000, Gathering of Developers released a trilogy of computer games based on the films, which greatly expanded on the myths suggested in the first film. The graphics engine and characters were all derived from the producer's earlier game \"Nocturne\". Each game, developed by a different team, focused on different aspects of the Blair Witch mythology: Rustin Parr, Coffin Rock, and Elly Kedward, respectively.\n\nThe trilogy received mixed reviews from critics, with most criticism being directed towards the very linear gameplay, clumsy controls and camera angles, and short length. The first volume, \"Rustin Parr\", received the most praise, ranging from moderate to positive, with critics commending its storyline, graphics and atmosphere; some reviewers even claimed that the game was scarier than the movie. The following volumes were less well-received, with \"PC Gamer\" saying that Volume 2's only saving grace was its cheap price and calling Volume 3 \"amazingly mediocre\".\n\nEduardo Sanchez, director of \"The Blair Witch Project\" said about the \"Blair Witch\" franchise in 2009:\n\nTelevision series\n\nOn October 30, 2017, Sánchez revealed on the Diminishing Returns podcast that he and the rest of the film's creative team are developing a \"Blair Witch\" television series, though he pointed out that any decisions would ultimately be up to Lionsgate now that they own the rights to it.\n"}

Without proper resources and training, many countries around the world struggle to maintain books and manuscripts as part of their cultural history. Environmental conditions pose perhaps the greatest threat to these materials. Political instability also endangers library and museum collections. Recent contributions are helping to address specific needs and promote the development of preservation programs.\n\nAll library collections experience damage from use and decay from the aging process. Due to a variety of economic, historic, environmental and political factors, libraries and archival repositories in developing countries face exceptional challenges in book and manuscript preservation. Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East have been identified as areas with materials having critical need for preservation. Local librarians and archivists struggle to provide access for patrons while protecting the structural integrity of materials against damage from over-use, neglect, and extreme climate conditions.\n\nThis is especially difficult as print materials in developing countries are often created using fragile, non-lasting paper product and ink. Providing information and education about preservation practices and principles is becoming an increasing focus for professionals working in countries with established practices. Going back to at least the year 2000, efforts have been made to establish a decision matrix and guidelines for preservation workers in developing countries to use in implementing preservation and conservation programs.\n\nIn August 1985, John F. Dean became Cornell University Library's first preservation and conservation librarian. Dean's efforts helped the Department of Preservation and Conservation at Cornell to grow into one of the leading programs of its kind in the United States. Aside from his work at Cornell, Dean has made important contributions towards improving preservation efforts in developing countries. He has created online tutorials for library conservation and preservation in Southeast Asia and Iraq and the Middle East. The tutorials are designed so that librarians and archivists in these and other countries have a set of basic guidelines to refer to when dealing with preservation issues. Specific topics addressed in the tutorials include \"Management and Planning\", \"Preservation\", \"Building Capacity\" and \"Supporting the Effort\". Both tutorials are available in English; the tutorial for Iraq and the Middle East is also available in Arabic.\n\nThe advancement of technology and IT professions in India has resulted in a large number of digital library projects across the country. The main problem these initiatives are running into are access and copyright laws.\n\nMunoz-Sola points out the impracticality of mounting modern environmental controls in a library to stabilize temperature and humidity in the balmy Puerto Rican climate. The expense involved in creating an ideal environment in both energy and manpower would counteract positive outcomes for the condition of collections. Puerto Rico also has an additional concern with preservation: due to political instability in the past, many libraries and collections have been destroyed, which places a greater need on preserving what is left. Munoz-Sola also points out that many developing countries are in tropical climates, and thus face these problems.\n\nConservators at the Ukraine V. Stefanyk Scientific Library of the National Academy of Sciences make the effort to adapt advanced preservation techniques to their home area by hiring local craftsmen to manufacture necessary tools and equipment. This library has a well-established conservation program, with staff trained at workshops in Europe.\n\nThe L’viv National University Library in Bulgaria received enough funds from their government to build a new facility to house extra collections and offices. However the new building, with its brand new heating system has caused the collections to deteriorate much more rapidly than those collections stored in the main building which has thick stone walls and a naturally occurring stable environment. These countries are coping with the transition from being under Soviet rule to self-governing states.\n\n\n\n"}

The magnificent art in the caves includes figures of various animals of the time such as bison, horses, goats, deer, cattle, hands and other paintings. Archaeologists have found remains of animals such as bears, the remains of arrows and other material indicating a human presence; these artifacts are now found mostly in the Regional Museum of Prehistory and Archaeology of Cantabria.\n\nThe cave of Las Aguas is located near the town of Novales, in the municipality of Alfoz de Lloredo. This cave contains rock art, including two bison carved and painted in red, a doe, a horse, a clavate (club), a sign on the grill and several more configurations. These remains have been dated to the early or middle Magdalenian period.\n\nThe Cave of Altamira is located near Santillana del Mar. This cave, called the \"Sistine Chapel of Quaternary\", is relatively small () and contains the rock paintings of sixteen bison, several depictions of deer, the largest of which is tall and of horses. The cave has been included in UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 1985.\n\nThe Cave of la Clotilde is located in the town of Santa Isabel de Quijas in the region of Reocín. Remains suggest that this area was occupied during the Magdalenian period; its cave paintings date from before the Aurignacian period, which include representations of animals and other symbols of unknown nature.\n\nThe cave of Cualventi is located in the town of Peralada, in Oreña in the municipality Alfoz of Lloredo dating approximately to the Magdalenian age. Several red spots can be found using the techniques of \"buffered\" and \"spot\" to depict a huge bison, goats, deer and horses very similar to the Cave of El Pendo, Cave of Covalanas and other Cantabrian caves.\n\nCullalvera Cave is located in the municipality of Ramales de la Victoria, capital of the comarca of Valley of the Asón River. The entry for this cave near the village arises from a Cantabrian oak, and it is part of a karstic complex about in size, in which a multitude of geological forms shaped by water over the course of thousands of years can be found. These forms in conjunction with other prehistoric remains make the cave one of the most visited of the region. Remains of a small reservoir and rock art, both from the Paleolithic have been found here.\n\nThe Cave of Chufín is located in the village of Riclones. It is located at the confluence point of several rivers and Nansa Lamasón in an environment with steep slopes amongst other caves with rock art. Chufín contains different levels of occupation, the oldest being around 20,000 years old. Even though the cave is small and of profound simplicity it subtle red paintings of deer, goats and cattle which are represented very schematically and a large number of symbols. One group, called \"sticks\", accompanies the animal paintings inside the cave. There are also a large number of pointillist drawings, including some around each hole in the rock which have been interpreted as a representation of a vulva. The cave has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2008.\n\nThe Cave of La Estación is located near the cave of La Clotilde, in Santa Isabel de Quijas.

There is also another group of paintings of lines and vulvas and remains of the Bronze Age.\n\nThe Cave of Los Marranos is located in Venta de Fresnedo, in the municipality of Lamasón; to access the cave, one follows a path that leads to two spring mouths. Geologically, it acts as a drain in times of flooding. It has a spacious entry with rock art. Remains of Paleolithic art are represented mainly by carvings in quartzite. a bronze buckle from the late Middle Ages indicates the possibility that the cave could have served as a shelter for travelers. In 2000, it was declared Bien de Interés Cultural by the Spanish Ministry of Law.\n\nThe cave of La Meaza is located in the municipality of Comillas. On the road to the district of La Molina there is a path leading to the cavity. Findings include the remains of Solutrean, Azilian and even some so-called Asturien evidence, recent prehistoric burials and remains of the Middle Ages. The fact that occupancy has many times explained by the shape of the cave, with a wide entrance and a comfortable lobby to your room. At the bottom of the cavity some remains of Paleolithic rock art framed in the style III of Leroi-Gourhan were found, although they have not been kept too well.\n\nThe Cave of Micolón is an archaeological site on the verge of the Palombera reservoir. It is a cavity of length with a particularly narrow labyrinthine structure, in which some flint carvings have been found, such as nodules with signs of having been worked on and a chisel.

{"id": "28504438", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28504438", "title": "Cuarenta Casas", "text": "Cuarenta Casas\n\nCuarenta Casas is an archaeological site in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua. Construction of the site is attributed to the Mogollon culture.\n\nLocated in Vallecito in the municipality of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Forty Houses is believed to be the southernmost site related to the period of Mogollon influence. The site consists of a series of cliff dwellings built in natural caves in the cliffs of Huapoca Canyon. The best known is the \"Cueva de las Ventanas\" (Cave of the Windows). Early Spanish explorers named the site Cuarenta Casas (\"forty houses\") based on their speculation of the total number of structures. The area consists of five main cave communities: Cueva del Puente, Cueva de la Serpiente, Nido del Aguila and Cueva Grande.\n\nThe zone is located 45 kilometers north of the Maderas Municipality, in the Sierra Madre Occidental, Mexico, and some 250 kilometers northwest of Chihuahua City.\nThere are five Paquimé Culture archaeological sites in this area, accessible from the Madera municipality, are:\n\nLocated 36 kilometers west of Madera, by a dirt road. The Ancestral Pueblo caves consist of the Serpent and the Eagle Nest caves. They are considered the most impressive built on cliffs. Have complete structures.\n\nThere are wonderful views of the Huapoca Canyon.\n\nIt has 14 adobe houses, over 1,000 years old.\n\nIt only has one house, built on the edge of a sheer cliff under a rocky overhang, provides a meaning to its name.\n\nLocated 66 kilometers west of Madera, on a dirt road. Cueva Grande hides within convoluted land and behind branches of trees. The mouth of the cave is obscured by a waterfall from the top of the cave to a stream.\nThere are two, double-story houses (800 years old) that are good examples of the native construction techniques. There is also a round grain storage area behind the structure.\n\nCave complex, 50 kilometers south of Madera. Has an extended archaeological remain area at the base of the Sirupa canyon.\n\n45 kilometers north of Madera\n\nDuring the early 16th century, explorer Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca wrote, \"And here by the side of the mountain, we forged our way inland more than 50 leagues and there found forty houses (cuarenta casas).\"\n\nThe current inhabitation of Chihuahua probably initiated throughout the Western Mountain Range (Sierra Madre Occidental), when native hunter-gatherer groups moved from the north looking for areas with abundant edible plants. One of those groups produced the first known evidences in the \"Cueva de las Ventanas\", when they still lacked the constructions we now see. As these settlers dominated agricultural techniques, gradually began occupying the margins of the rivers and originated the Paquimé culture, neighboring what today is known as Casas Grandes, Chihuahua.\n\nCuarentas Casas construction occurred during the height of Paquimé (Casas Grandes) (1205-1260 CE), a period corresponding to the late Mogollon culture period. Cuarentas Casas was a refuge site, similar to others at the Mesa Verde and Bandelier sites. The buildings share the typical T-shaped doorways of their northern neighbors and are constructed from adobe and rock with pine logs beams.\n\nIt is possible that Cuarenta Casas was a garrison that protected allied groups in the region, in addition to safekeeping commercial routes. It settlers farmed maize and pumpkin, their nourishment was supplemented with hunting of small species (rabbits) and harvesting of eatable wild plants like acorns, yucca seeds and maguey leaves. This was confirmed by remains found in archaeological excavations. The Paquimé regional center must have had frequent problems with hostile neighboring groups, which explains the presence of many surveillance points in extensive areas. Besieged by those groups or perhaps by internal problems, the settlement decayed, was abandoned and some of its inhabitants emigrated.\n\nConstructions date back to that period; at that time the zone was a meeting point for native traders of the Paquimé group communicating with the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of California coasts, and to other cultural centers to the north such as Mesa Verde in Colorado and Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. The routes to the Pacific followed the Piedras Verdes River to the south and connected with the rivers that flow to the Pacific by way of smaller arroyos and canyons. Among these is the Huapoca Canyon to the west of the town of Madera. The Huapoca Canyon is not among the deepest of the Sierra Tarahumara but it possesses the most archaeological interest.\n\nThe reasons why the settlement decayed, at 1340 CE are not known. At the Paquimé fall as social and cultural center, the commercial routes disappeared, the guardians left their posts and many settlements throughout the route were abandoned. Occasionally \"Cueva de las Ventanas\" was briefly occupied mainly with ceremonial purposes.\n\nAs of 1520, the caves still were inhabited by native groups, hence it was possible to obtain information about their way of life, the natives named themselves \"Jovas\" or Cáhitas, and with that name they also referred to a group or larger family. This ethnic group is now considered extinct.\n\nThe latest occupation of Cuarenta Casas occurred during the Paquimé apogee (1205 to 1260 CE); this period corresponds to the late period of Paquimé culture.\n\nOf the cave complex, the only area partially restored is the \"Cueva de las Ventanas\". It is a small archaeological site constructed with strong walls of poured adobe, with small \"T\" doors, characterizing the region pre-Hispanic architecture. It is a two-story structure of which only the ground floor rooms can be visited, these are distributed such that space was maximized within the space available in the cave.\n\nAlmost all rooms had stuccoed floors and furnaces.\n\nIt is almost totally destroyed and was placed towards the cave slope.\n\nOn its higher section, a watchtower was constructed; it has a large number of small windows. It was equipped with a small drain channel and a urinal, the only ones found at the site. It is suspected it was used particularly during the crude winters of the region.\n\nIt is a large room, by its characteristics it must have been an area where most daily activities took place. Because of a sidewalk carved on the rock it is believed to have been used for certain ceremonies, as was done in the kivas, by southwestern US natives, from prehispanic times. This site has relevant similarities with sites of that region.\n\nThe room is partially roofed with pine beams and displays remains of windows that would perhaps complement those of the watchtower. Vestiges of a normal size door was found, all others are a meter of high. In this enclosure and almost in all other, the remains of strong floors with well finished stucco can be seen.\n\nIt is almost totally destroyed, it lacks ceiling, and remaining walls indicate that its size was larger than others in the cave's back, with similar functions to those of Room 3.\n\nIts layout is irregular and it was built over a large rock. From old photographs of the site, it is known that its interior had an oval-shaped barn, with a kind of woven grass cover. Its overall height was two meters, currently, it is totally destroyed and it is only possible to see remains of the walls in the floor; these were reinforced with dry woven grass and covered with mud. Other similar barns have been found in like sites of the \"Sierra Madre Occidental\".\n\nThe remaining rooms were built at the end of the cave, embedded in the rocky wall and it is believed were housing units.\n\nNumber 6 is in the south side and still has its ceiling pine wood beams in good conditions. Being adjacent to rooms 3 and 7 it is very dark and cold.\n\nNumber 7 is similar to the previous one, does not have any distinguishing characteristics. Number 8 lacks a ceiling and has access to a small area that perhaps was used as an internal patio. Perhaps it was used to manufacture arrows, as a required complementary activity. Several stone tools were found, of the type used to carve and smooth the wooden materials used to make projectiles.\n\nBoth are deteriorated and 10 were probably propped up by the last inhabitants. Vestiges of small stoves were found as well as compacted earth steps that lead to the long enclosures that are to the front.\n\nBasically it is similar to the previous, but for some reason native groups of similar cultures to the constructors, visited it and painted zoomorphic designs on its walls; these are streamlined figures that represent elongated birds, the beak is apparent. It is possible that these artists were the original inhabitants, which returned to celebrate some type of ritual that could not be made elsewhere.\n\nAn individual burial was found, perhaps a local leader, it was placed in the small space between the wall and the rock of the cave. It had a small maize offering, one ceramic pot and a leather bag with pinole, used by pre-Hispanic people of Mexico. The burial also contained, semiprecious stones, possibly currency to ensure his entrance to the underworld. The man was shrouded in a mortuary bed roll (Petate) similar those depicted in some of the pre-Hispanic codices.\n\nNumber 13 is very deteriorated and perhaps had large dimensions.\n\nNumber 14 is smaller and isolated, was constructed at the rocky bottom and because of its small dimensions it could only be used to sleep, as well as to temporarily isolate people, as per inhabitants beliefs, and as was done with young girls at the time of their first menstruation. This custom was practiced by native groups of the area, even in current times.\n\nFrom this room it is possible to see the floors of the second floor rooms, although deteriorated, clay molded forms can be seen near the center of each floor; these are of rectangular shape and not too high, perhaps stoves used in the site.\n\n\n\n"}

This site is part of the Filobobos zone, where vestiges of at least six archaeological sites are known. Currently only two have been explored; Vega de la Peña and El Cuajilote.\n\nCuajilote, is also the name of a tree (Parmentiera aculeate), also known as huachilote or monkey cocoa, typical of low deciduous forest, exist in broad territories in the South and Centre Mexico.\n\nAccording to INAH the Filobobos name derives from the local sharp profiles (“Filos”) of gorges and ravines, created by a geologic phenomenon from the Cenozoic era, and of “”bobos”, name of an almost extinct fish variety, very appreciated in the region.\nThe gorges and water falls, have allowed a natural preservation of the Filobobos Archeological Site.\n\nIt is a very fertile region and from prehispanic time it has been an important natural communication corridor between the Central Plateau and the Gulf of Mexico, used by diverse ethnic groups for travels, in the process of commercial and cultural trade.\n\nThis site is located within the urban area of Tlapacoya, Alonso de Molina, establishes that Atzalan is a Nahuatl word meaning \"place where washing is done \", i.e. laundry. Cecilio Agustín Robelo, noted the word to be an impersonal verb “tlapa”, wash and yan, is the place where the verb’s action takes place, resulting in \"place where wahsing or laundry takes place\". Peñafiel interpreted the Tlapacoyan hieroglyph from the Matrícula de Tributos (Mendocino Codex) and adds establishes that the sign Teltl, means stone below water (atl) and above a fantastic figure which could be a white and black canvas with a hand over it, indicating a verbal word derived from Tlapaca \"wash\" ending with location prefix \"Yan\".\n\nAtzalan is of Totonac origin, there was a large city here, known today as “Vega de la Peña”. In the 16th century here was an old town called Yohualtlacualoyan, ancient center of Tenochtitlan tributary cities, including the cities of: Xilochitlán Xochicuauhtlan, Tuchtlán Coapan, Aztapan and Acazacatlán\n\nHistorical records establish that this area was a tax collection center (products) for the empire in this zone, it collected several products, including bird feathers Empire.\n\nEl Cuajilote flourished towards 200 CE, and had a constant occupation until 800 CE. Some constructions seem to have been altars, as vestiges indicate aspects of fertility and earth cult.\n\nPermanence of inhabitants in the Filobobos archaeological zone was made possible by the availability of survival resources, the permanent supply of water and its constant exploration, complemented with the bordering archaeological niches in high and low lands around the gorges. The ball games are different in both sites and have opposite alignment.\n\nUrban development is seen in the arrangement of the archaeological sites, which becomes evident by the urban planning adapted to the physiographic and natural terrain; for example hydraulic infrastructure is evident in the water wells, channels and Temazcales.\n\nThe great Totonaca Plaza, sheltered by cliffs, canyons and ravines is crossed by the Filobobos River, it is located in a very humid zone estimated at a little more than 2000 years old.\n\nThe site has an extension of about 31,500 square meters. It is estimated that there are 10.5 hectares of unexplored structures.\n\nThe main plaza has a phallic sculpture representing fertility. \nPhallic figurines were found, of the type known as “San Jose de Acateno”, representing a dual personage, fertility and rebirth worship, manifested by cycles of constant life renovation, which culminates with the triumph of the sun over darkness of the underworld.\n\nIn this area, there are several archaeological sites not yet explored, including “Piedra Blanca” on the left bank of the river; “Vega de la Peña”, an ancient town, 3 km below; \"La Colorada\" on the road to Martínez de la Torre, and \"El Relicario\". This site was opened to the public in 1994.\n\nIt is estimated that there are over 500 structures, with height ranging from 6 and 80 metros.\n\nThe Main plaza has 10 important side buildings and the main temple, there are other smaller plazas.\n\nThe site is laid out and aligned with three axes south-north, separated by well laid mounds that confine plazas of approximately 400 meters long by 80 meters wide with central altars. The main plaza is bordered on the north side by a ball game court.\n\nAs part of the main plaza is the ballgame court, which enclose the central plaza to the north, the wall have stucco plaster remains. A feline sculpture with a spike for embedding and offering pots, possibly representing Tezcatlipoca.\n\nThe ballgame court, built on the river bank, is aligned northwest-southeast, adapted to the physiographical conditions imposed by the Bobos River, whose flow is towards the west.\n\nThe place have five building complexes, that for INAH reasons have been named in agreement with the cardinal position in which they are located; e.g., west, center, south and southeastern complex.\n\nThe ballgame courts evidences a large El Tajín style influence and conserves stucco plaster remains on its walls.\n\nThis altar was named “Tlaltecuhtli”, represents a frog, carved from a single stone piece, displays on the sides a possible “Chalchihuitlxóchitl” or “divine flower”, as well as a mutilated face.\n\nIn front of the previous altar, an enormous circular Temazcal was excavated.\n\nAbout a kilometer to the north, what are believed to be astronomical markers known as “Teos” or Geoglyphs were found, protruding about a meter from the ground, made from volcanic rock, with engraved figures and spirals indicating the site distribution, believed to have been markers for pilgrims.\n\nThe \"Templo del Manatial\", is located at the top, shows remains of a double room.

He published many travel books, including translations of the work of Marco Polo and \"Mirabilia\" by the 14th century Dominican Friar Jordanus. He was also the compiler of a dictionary of Anglo-Indian terms, the \"Hobson-Jobson\", along with Arthur Coke Burnell.\n\nHenry Yule was born at Inveresk near Edinburgh in Scotland on 1 May 1820. He was the youngest son of Major William Yule (1764–1839) and his wife Elizabeth Paterson (died circa 1827). William Yule had served as an officer in the Bengal army of the East India Company and had retired in 1806. He was interested in Arabic and Persian literature and collected early manuscripts. These were later donated by his sons to the British Museum. He translated the \"Apothegms of Ali the son of Abu Talib\" (referring to Ali, the successor to Mohammed, the prophet of Islam; the obscure English word \"apothegm\" refers to short pithy sayings, see \"hadith\".)\n\nYule's mother died before he was eight and William moved to Edinburgh with his sons. Yule attended the Royal High School and then in 1833 was sent to be coached by the Reverend Henry Hamilton at his rectory in the village of Wath near Ripon in North Yorkshire. When Hamilton moved to Cambridge in the following year Yule was transferred to the care of the Reverend James Challis, at Papworth Everard near Cambridge. The other resident pupils were John Neale and Harvey Goodwin. (Neale co-founded the Society of Saint Margaret, an order of women in the Church of England dedicated to nursing the sick, while Goodwin became Bishop of Carlisle.) Yule's stay at Papworth Everard ended in 1826 when Challis was appointed Plumian Professor of Astronomy and moved to the Observatory in Cambridge.\n\nAfter a brief period at University College London, Yule entered the East India Military College at Addiscombe near Croydon (1837–8), followed by the Royal Engineers Establishment at Chatham, Kent. He obtained his commission in December 1838, and joined the Bengal Engineers in 1840.\n\nBoth of Henry's brothers worked in India. The eldest, George Udny Yule (1813–1886), worked in the Bengal civil service. The other brother, Robert (1817–1857), died near Delhi during the Indian Rebellion. The statistician Udny Yule was the son of George and thus the nephew of Henry.\n\nYule arrived in Calcutta at the end of 1840. His first posting was in the Khasi Hills, a remote area to the northeast of Bengal in the modern state of Meghalaya. His mission was to establish a practical method of transporting coal to the plains. In this he was unsuccessful but he became fascinated by the region and wrote an account of its people, including the first written description of their living root bridges. In 1842 he was transferred to a team of engineers led by Captain (later General) William Baker charged with the construction of irrigation canals. Their headquarters were at Karnal, to the north of Delhi.\n\nHe returned to England in 1843 and married his cousin Anna Maria (d. 1875), daughter of Major-General Martin White of the Bengal Infantry (d. 1856). In November 1843 she accompanied him back to India but returned owing to ill health. He was appointed to a committee charged with investigating the relationship between irrigation by the proposed Ganges Canal and its impact on public health in the area. He served in both the Sikh wars (1845-6 and 1848-9). In 1849 he took three years of extended leave and returned to live in Edinburgh with his wife. He lectured at the Scottish Naval and Military Academy and wrote a volume on fortifications (1851).. \n\nA daughter, Amy, was born in 1852 and shortly after her birth, Yule returned to Bengal. He worked in Arakan and Burma and was put in charge of a new railway system. This was interrupted by a posting as a secretary to Colonel Arthur Phayre's mission to Ava, Burma, in 1855. In 1858 he published his account of this journey, \"Narrative of the Mission to the Court of Ava\" with illustrations. The 1857 rebellion made his life difficult, and although Yule was close to the governor generals Lord Dalhousie and Lord Canning, he lost interest in his work.\n\nYule retired in 1862, and Canning's death in that year made it difficult for him to find any official appointment in London. In 1863 he was created a Companion of the Order of the Bath through the influence of Sir Roderick Murchison. He devoted his leisure to the medieval history and geography of Central Asia. His wife became unwell, and they crossed Europe to settle in Palermo, Sicily. He made use of the richly stocked public libraries there during this period. He published \"Cathay and the Way Thither\" (1866), and the \"Book of Marco Polo\" (1871), for which he received the Founder's Gold Medal of the Royal Geographical Society the following year. After his wife's death in 1875, Yule returned to England where he was appointed to the Council of India. Yule remarried in 1877, his new wife Mary Wilhelmina (died 26 April 1881) the daughter of a Bengal civil servant, Fulwar Skipwith.\n\nYule was a member, and from 1877 to 1889 President, of the Hakluyt Society. He was also vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society (1887–9), and would have become a president but for a protest that he led along with Henry Hyndman against Henry Morton Stanley. The Society wanted to welcome Stanley but Yule stood against the violent methods used in Africa. One of his heroes, on the other hand, was Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley.\n\nFor the Hakluyt Society, Yule edited the \"Mirabilia Descripta\" (1863), a translation of the travels of the 14th century Friar Jordanus, and \"The Diary of William Hedges\" (3 vols, 1887–89). The latter contains a biography of Governor Pitt, grandfather of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham. He contributed introductions to Nikolay Przhevalsky's \"Mongolia\" (1876) and Captain William Gill's \"The River of Golden Sand\" (1880). He wrote biographical notes for the Royal Engineers' \"Journal\", and many geographical entries in the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\".\n\nYule's most popular work, compiled with Arthur C. Burnell, was the \"Hobson-Jobson\" (1886), a historical dictionary of Anglo-Indian words and phrases which continues to provide an insight into the language used in British India.\n\nYule died at his home in Earls Court, London, on 30 December 1889 aged 69, and is buried at Tunbridge Wells.\n\nYule was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) from Edinburgh University in 1884 and served as royal commissioner for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of 1886. He was created Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in 1889.\n\nFor a full list see Cordier & Yule (1903).\n\nEditions revised by Henri Cordier\n\n\nContributions\n\n\n\n"}

Stanley Moss, a British soldier, writer and traveller. It describes an operation in Crete during the Second World War to capture German general Heinrich Kreipe. Moss kept a diary during the war years and based his book on it. The 2014 edition includes an introduction by one of Moss's children and an afterword by Patrick Leigh Fermor.\n\nThe story was made into a 1957 film with the same title starring Dirk Bogarde by the British writer-director-producer team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger.\n\nMoss recounted his and Patrick Leigh Fermor’s activities during the Second World War as agents in Crete of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), notably their extraordinary kidnapping of Heinrich Kreipe, Commander of the 22nd Air Landing Infantry Division that was occupying Crete, and his removal to Cairo (and British war forces) in 1944. The manuscript was written in early 1945 but was censored by the Head of SOE, Major-General Sir Colin Gubbins (CD), by instruction to Colin Mackenzie (BB100), Head of Force 136. When the book was finally published in 1950, it was selected by W. Somerset Maugham as one of the best three books of that year writing,\"more thrilling than any detective story I can remember, and written in a modest and most engaging manner\". The book was chosen to lead the BBC's famous radio series \"Now it can be told\" of 1950. It has been republished many times since and remains in print.\n\nThe title is a quotation from Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (Act 2, Scene 1, Line 60).\n\nThe book has been translated into Spanish, Italian and Greek.\n\nThe aftermath of \"Ill Met by Moonlight\" is described in Moss's second book, \"A War of Shadows\", covering his return to Crete and his subsequent operations in Greece and the Far East.\n\nIn May 1941, German forces attacked and occupied Crete. Allied forces were driven back and evacuated to North Africa by June. The Special Operations Executive (SOE) inserted agents on Crete in order to work with the local resistance in harrying German occupying forces.\n\nOn 4 February 1944, Major Patrick Leigh Fermor and Captain William Stanley Moss and two Cretan SOE agents left Egypt by plane for Crete. Their intention was to parachute into Crete but after arriving at the drop zone, only Leigh Fermor was able to parachute successfully. The others had to abandon the attempt due to bad weather and were returned to Egypt. On landing Leigh Fermor was met by a group from the Cretan resistance, with whom he remained until the arrival of the rest of the SOE team. After three more attempts at a parachute jump over a two-month period, Moss and the other two arrived by Motor Launch ML 842 on 4 April 1944. They were met on the beach by Leigh Fermor and another SOE agent, Sandy Rendel.\n\nTheir target General Müller was replaced by General Kreipe just before they arrived. The team decided to proceed with the plan to abduct the German commanding officer. The SOE team included a number of Cretans; 'Anthony' (Antonis Papaleonidas), 'Micky' (Michalis Akoumianakis) and Grigorios Chnarakis. Micky was especially welcome as his house was opposite Kreipe's residence, the Villa Ariadne, in the village of Knossos. The team reconnoitred the area and planned the abduction. Dressed as a Cretan shepherd, Leigh Fermor travelled on the local bus to check Knossos and the area around the German headquarters. He decided that the German headquarters would be too difficult to penetrate. After a few days of alternately observing the actions of the General, they finalized the details of the abduction. The plan was for the two British officers, dressed as corporals in the \"Feldgendarmerie\" (German military police), to stop the general's car on his way home at what was supposed to be a routine check point.\n\nOn the night of 26 April 1944, the two British officers stopped the General's car before the Villa Ariadne. When the car stopped, Leigh Fermor took care of Kreipe and Moss knocked the driver out with his cosh. Moss drove the team and the General in the General's car for an hour and a half through 22 controlled road blocks in Heraklion before leaving Leigh Fermor to abandon the car. When Leigh Fermor left the car, he also left documents revealing that the kidnapping had been done by British Commandos so that no reprisals should be taken against the local population.\n\nWith his Cretan escorts, Moss set off with the General across country to a rendezvous where they would be joined by Leigh Fermor. Hunted by German patrols, the group moved across the mountains to reach the southern side of the island, where a British motor launch (ML 842 commanded by Brian Coleman) was to pick them up. On 14 May 1944, the SOE team and the general were finally picked up from a beach near Rodakino, possibly Peristeres beach, on the southern side of the island. They were transported to safety, landing at Mersa Matruh in Egypt.\n\nAfter the war, a member of Kreipe’s staff reported how, on hearing the news of the kidnapping, an uneasy silence in the officers' mess in Heraklion was followed by, “Well gentlemen, I think this calls for champagne all round.” Post War correspondence explains that Kreipe was disliked by his soldiers because, amongst other things, he objected to the stopping of his own vehicle for checking in compliance with his commands concerning approved travel orders. This tension between the General and his troops, in part, explains the caution of sentries in considering stopping the General’s car as Moss drove it through Heraklion.\n\nThe book was due to be published in Germany in 1950. Kreipe alleged that he had never given his parole not to shout or to try to escape to Moss and Leigh Fermor as described by Moss in the book. Kreipe secured an injunction preventing publication of the book in Germany on the grounds that the statement in the book was untrue. Leigh Fermor's report after the operation and the publication of his account of the abduction published in 2015 both corroborated Moss's version of events.\n\n\nNotes\n"}

Before it was officially renamed \"Kerberos Saga\" \"circa\" 2004, it was known as the or the .\n\nThe franchise is currently owned by Mamoru Oshii and the Barque company; It consists of works based on Oshii's original story spanning in various media including feature films, radio dramas, comic books, animation films and monographs.

Merchandising includes posters, folding fans, mousepads, statuette busts, tee-shirts and even bottles of wine with a dedicated online shop available on the official website.\n\n\n\nIn order to celebrate \"The Red Spectacles\"' 20-year anniversary (actually the movie's 1986 production since the theatrical release is February 1987), a new Protect Gear armour (Type 34 \"Wolfpelz\") was designed by Jun Suemi in 2006 as part of a new Kerberos Saga project.

This was released as a sample of the upcoming two-volume \"Kerberos Panzer Cop\" \"revised edition\" to which it will be included.\n\nAs a military science fiction work the Kerberos Saga's main characters are members of rival military and police services, namely the Shutokei (a.k.a. the \"Capital Police\" in the English language adaptation), the Self-Police (\"Local Police\" in the English adaptation) and the JSDF.

In the Greek mythology, the \"Kerberos\" (Cerberus) watchdog guards the gates of the Underworld, called Hades, to prevent those who have crossed the river Styx from ever escaping. Hence the sewer can be regarded as an allegory of the Underworld; the original title for the 1991 movie \"StrayDog\" is \"kerberos: watchdog of \"jigoku\"\" (ケルベロス 地獄の番犬, \"keruberosu: jigoku no banken\") with \"jigoku\" being the realm of the dead in the Japanese mythology.\n\nThe saga started in January 1987 with the Japanese broadcast of the radio drama series \"While Waiting for the Red Spectacles\" (紅い眼鏡を待ちつつ, \"Akai megane o machi tsutsu\"), prior to the theatrical release of the live-action film \"The Red Spectacles\" (紅い眼鏡, \"Akai megane\").

For example, the Brigham Young University law school in 2000 created \"The International Center for Law and Religion Studies.\" It has an international mission and its annual symposium (which began in 1993) has brought to campus over 1000 scholars, human rights activists, judges from supreme courts, and government ministers dealing with religious affairs from more than 120 countries. \n\nAs of 2012, major law and religion organizations in the U.S. included 500 law professors, 450 political scientists, and specialists in numerous other fields such as history and religious studies. Between 1985 and 2010, the field saw the publication of some 750 books and 5000 scholarly articles, according to Emory Law Professor John Witte, Jr..\n\nScholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non establishment but also on the study of religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding on religious phenomena. For example, \"The Oxford Journal of Law and Religion\" seeks to cover:\n\nExponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in comparative perspective. Specialists have explored themes in western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, discipline and love. Common topics of interest include marriage and the family, and human rights. Moving beyond Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East, Asian ancestral religions, occult altercations, pagan Rome and any realm in which religious beliefs form the basis of or contradict governmental law.\n\nWithin Christianity, studies range from textual analysis of early Christians' relationship with Jewish Law, the effect of law on the Protestant Reformation, and modern day issues like homosexual unions, the ordination of women to the diaconate and priesthood, and consciences objectors to war. \n\nImportant studies have appeared regarding secularization. In particular the issue of wearing religion symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.\n\nIn Thailand, the constitutional monarchy that was established in the 1930s integrated traditional Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion with modern methods of public administration and legal authority. The result was the formation of a unique civic religion based on the three-way formula of nation, religion, and kingship. This new tradition has evolved and provides a framework for both the symbolic discourse as well as practical actions in modern Thai legal culture.\n\n\n\n\nr"}

It was written by Paul McCartney, although credited to Lennon–McCartney. \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" is a pop song with dark, eccentric lyrics about a medical student named Maxwell Edison who commits murders with a hammer. The lyrics are disguised by the upbeat, catchy, and rather \"childlike\" sound of the song. The recording sessions for the track were an acrimonious time for the Beatles, as McCartney pressured his bandmates to work at length on the song. John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr were vocal in their dislike of the song. Author Ian MacDonald described it as the \"single recording [that] shows why The Beatles broke up\".\n\nWhile in Rishikesh, India, on retreat, Paul began to write the first verse of the song. Having completed most of it by October 1968, he intended for its inclusion on the album \"The Beatles\", but it was never properly recorded during those sessions due to time constraints. It was rehearsed again three months later, in January 1969, at Twickenham film studios during the \"Get Back\" sessions but would not be recorded for another six months. The film features two brief rehearsal takes compiled together showing the band's progress on the song up to that point. Lennon is shown to be participating on electric guitar despite not featuring on the recording for \"Abbey Road\" at all. Road manager and Beatles associate Mal Evans participates by providing the anvil hits.\n\nMcCartney's wife Linda said that he had become interested in avant-garde theatre and had immersed himself in the writings of Alfred Jarry. This influence is reflected in the story and tone of \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\", and also explains how McCartney came across Jarry's word \"pataphysical\", which occurs in the lyrics.\n\nLennon dismissed it as \"more of Paul's granny music\". In 1994, McCartney said that the song epitomises the downfalls of life, being \"my analogy for when something goes wrong out of the blue, as it so often does, as I was beginning to find out at that time in my life. I wanted something symbolic of that, so to me it was some fictitious character called Maxwell with a silver hammer. I don't know why it was silver, it just sounded better than Maxwell's hammer.\"\n\nThe Beatles began recording the song at EMI Studios (later Abbey Road Studios) in London on 9 July 1969. John Lennon, who had been absent from recording sessions for the previous eight days after being injured in a car crash, arrived to work on the song, accompanied by his wife, Yoko Ono, who, more badly hurt in the accident than Lennon, lay on a large double-bed in the studio. Sixteen takes of the rhythm track were made, followed by a series of guitar overdubs. The unused fifth take can be heard on \"Anthology 3\". Over the following two days the group overdubbed vocals, piano, Hammond organ, anvil, and guitar. The song was completed on 6 August, when McCartney recorded a solo on a Moog synthesizer.\n\nThe recording process subsequently drew unfavourable comments from Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. Lennon said, \"I was ill after the accident when they did most of that track, and it really ground George and Ringo into the ground recording it\", adding later: \"I hate it, 'cos all I remember is the track ... [Paul] did everything to make it into a single, and it never was and it never could have been.\" Harrison recalled: \"Sometimes Paul would make us do these really fruity songs. I mean, my God, 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' was so fruity. After a while we did a good job on it, but when Paul got an idea or an arrangement in his head …\" Starr told \"Rolling Stone\" in 2008: \"The worst session ever was 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' It was the worst track we ever had to record. It went on for fucking weeks. I thought it was mad.\" McCartney recalled: \"The only arguments were about things like me spending three days on 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer.' I remember George saying, 'You've taken three days, it's only a song.' – 'Yeah, but I want to get it right. I've got some thoughts on this one.'\"\n\nIn his 1969 review of \"Abbey Road\", for \"Rolling Stone\", John Mendelsohn wrote: \"Paul McCartney and Ray Davies are the only two writers in rock and roll who could have written 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer', a jaunty vaudevillian/music-hallish celebration wherein Paul, in a rare naughty mood, celebrates the joys of being able to bash in the heads of anyone threatening to bring you down. Paul puts it across perfectly with the coyest imaginable choir-boy innocence.\" Robert Christgau referred to the song as \"a McCartney crotchet\".\n\nAmong Beatles biographers, Ian MacDonald said that \"If any single recording shows why The Beatles broke up, it's 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer'.\" He continued: \"This ghastly miscalculation – of which there are countless equivalents on his garrulous sequence of solo albums – represents by far his worst lapse of taste under the auspices of The Beatles … Thus \"Abbey Road\" embraces both extremes of McCartney: the clear-minded, sensitive caretaker of The Beatles in 'You Never Give Me Your Money' and the Long Medley – and the immature egotist who frittered away the group's patience and solidarity on sniggering nonsense like this.\" Author Jonathan Gould cites \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" as an example of the selfishness inherent in the Beatles' creative partnership, whereby a composition by McCartney or Lennon would be given preference over a more substantial song by Harrison. He also rues McCartney's penchant for a light entertainment style that the Beatles had sought to render obsolete, and concludes: \"The sorriest aspect of 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' is thus the way it demonstrates how Paul's workmanlike tendency to build on his past successes had caused him to translate the genuinely charming novelty and subversive parody of 'When I'm Sixty-Four' into a personal subgenre of glibly clever songs that had devolved in the two years since \"Sgt. Pepper\" into a form of musical \"schtick\".\"\n\n\nAccording to Ian MacDonald, Andy Babiuk and Mark Lewisohn:\n\nThe Beatles\n\nAdditional musician\n\n"}

Standards for what may be termed a miniature rather than just a small book have changed through time. Today, most collectors consider a book to be miniature only if it is 3 inches or smaller in height, width, and thickness, particularly in the United States. Many collectors consider nineteenth-century and earlier books of 4 inches to fit in the category of miniatures. Book from 3-4 inches in all dimensions are termed macrominiature books. Books less than 1 inch in all dimensions are called microminiature books. Books less than 1/4 inch in all dimensions are known as ultra-microminiature books.\n\nMiniature books stretch back far in history; many collections contain cuneiform tablets stretching back thousands of years, and exquisite medieval Books of Hours. Printers began testing the limits of size not long after the technology of printing began, and around 200 miniature books were printed in the sixteenth century. Exquisite specimens from the 17th century abound. In the 19th century, technological innovations in printing enabled the creation of smaller and smaller type. Fine and popular additions alike grew in number throughout the 19th century. While some miniature books are objects of high craft, bound in fine Moroccan leather, with gilt decoration and excellent examples of woodcuts, etchings, and watermarks, others are cheap, disposable, sometimes highly functional items not expected to survive. Today, miniature books are produced both as fine works of craft and as commercial products found in chain bookstores.\n\nSome popular types of miniature books from various periods include Bibles, encyclopedias, dictionaries, Bilingual dictionaries, short stories, verse, famous speeches, political propaganda, travel guides, almanacs, children's stories, and the miniaturization of well-known books such as \"The Compleat Angler\", \"The Art of War\", and Sherlock Holmes stories. \n\nAbraham Lincoln, \"Proclamation of Emancipation\" (Boston : John Murray Forbes, 1863). This miniature edition was the first of this text. It is estimated that a million copies were distributed to Union troops.\n\n\nMany books have claim to the title of smallest book in the world at the time of their publication. The title can apply to a variety of accomplishments: smallest overall size, smallest book with movable type, smallest printed book, smallest book legible to the naked eye, and so on.\n\n750: \"Hyakumantō darani\" or ‘One Million Pagoda Dharani.' Also one of the earliest known printed texts, these 2-3/8\" tall Buddhist charms were printed, rolled into a scroll, placed in miniature white pagodas, and distributed to Buddhist temples. A million were printed at the command of Japanese Empress Shotoku.\n\n1674: \"Bloem-Hofje\" (Amsterdam: Benedict Schmidt, 1674). For more than two centuries, this remained the smallest book printed with moveable type. \n\n1878: Dante, \"Divina Commedia\" (Milan: Gnocchi, 1878). 500 pages. 5 cm x 3.5 cm. Typeset and printed by the Salmin Brothers of Padua.\n\n1897: Galileo Galilei. \"Galileo a Madama Cristina di Loren\"a (Padua: dei Fratelli Salmin, 1897). 150 pages.

The whole construction rests on a horizontal sliver of a poppy seed.\"\n\nIn 2007, archaeologists found a miniature Bible (Glasgow: David Bryce & Son, 1901) tucked into a child's boot hidden in a chimney cavity in an English cottage attic. Shoes were placed in such locations as early as the fourteenth-century as anti-witchcraft devices known as \"spirit traps.\"\n\nThe creation of a miniature book requires exceptional skill in all aspects of book production, because elements such as bindings, pages, and type, illustrations, and subject matter all need to be approached with a new set of problems in mind. For instance, the pages of a miniature book do not fall open as do those of larger books, because the pages are not heavy enough. Bindings require exceptionally thin materials, and creating type that is readable and beautiful requires great skill. Many printers have created miniature books to test their own technical limits or to show off their skill. Many books have claimed the sought-after title of \"smallest book in the world,\" which is now held by experiments in nanoprinting.\n\nGood Book Press, Santa Cruz, California\n\nDawson's Book Shop, Los Angeles, CA\n\nThe Gleniffer Press\n\nGloria Stuart, the film actress, published numerous miniature books as collaborations with significant printers\n\nPlum Park Press\n\nThe Smallest Books in the World, Peru\n\nMiniboox German publisher of miniature books\n\nAchille St. Onge\n\nБукос(Bookos), russian publisher specializing in miniature craft books, Russia\n\nHarperCollins, Collins Gem Books division.\n\nOxford University Press published many miniature religious books and children's books in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nRunning Press, known for miniature books marketed as impulse buys in bookstore checkout lines.\n\nSanrio, known for tiny blank books in its Hello Kitty, Little Twin Stars, and other lines starting in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nSangorski & Sutcliffe\n\nJan Sobota\n\nTony Firman\n\nMargaret Hicks\n\nThe largest collection of miniature books in the United States is held by the Lilly Library at Indiana University Bloomington.

The museum’s 39 exhibition rooms cover 8,460 square meters and present more than 100,000 objects. It is home to 30 million objects available to more than 60 scientists and numerous guest researchers who carry out basic research in a wide range of topics related to human sciences, earth sciences, and life sciences.\n\nThe history of the Natural History Museum Vienna is shaped by the passion for collecting of renowned monarchs, the endless thirst for knowledge of famous scientists, and the spirit of adventure of travelling researchers. True to the spirit of the inscription carved into the front of the museum, scientists at the NHM Vienna have over the centuries dedicated themselves and their work “to the realm of nature and its exploration”.\n\nWhile in the 19th century this was expressed through major imperial research expeditions to little-known corners of the Earth, today it can be found in modern DNA analysis methods and meteorite research providing insights into unfamiliar worlds and the outer extremes of our cosmos. \n\nThe earliest collections of the Natural History Museum Vienna date back more than 250 years. It was Emperor Franz I Stephan of Lorraine, Maria Theresa’s husband, who in 1750 purchased what was at the time the world’s largest and most famous collection of natural history objects from the Florentine scholar and scientist Jean de Baillou. This was the first step on the road to creating the Natural History Museum Vienna.\n\nBaillou’s collection comprised 30,000 objects, including rare fossils, snails, mussels, and corals, as well as valuable minerals and precious stones. \n\nFranz I Stephan of Lorraine, who founded the Schönbrunn zoo in 1752 and the botanical garden in 1753, also organized the first scientific overseas expedition. In 1755 he commissioned Nicolaus Joseph Jacquin to travel to the Caribbean, the Antilles, Venezuela, and Colombia. Jacquin returned from this expedition with many live animals and plants for the zoo and the botanical garden, as well as 67 cases full of other items of interest from the natural world.\n\nAfter the Emperor’s death, Maria Theresa gave the natural science collection to the state and opened it up to the general public. Thus she created the first museum in line with the principles and visions of the Enlightenment.\n\nIt was Maria Theresa who brought the famous mineralogist Ignaz von Born to Vienna. Born, who had developed a new method of extracting precious metals, was tasked with classifying and expanding the collections. To this end he had minerals from many different regions sent to Vienna, where they were added to the collection. Under the leadership of Ignaz von Born the cabinet of natural history quickly developed into a center of practical research.\n\nTo mark the marriage of his daughter Leopoldine to the heir to the Portuguese throne, Dom Pedro, Emperor Franz II organized an expedition to her new home country of Brazil in 1817. Two Austrian frigates accompanied the archduchess on her journey to Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThose taking part in the expedition, carried out under the scientific direction of the head of the history collection, included the researchers Johann Mikan and Johann Emmanuel, as well as the taxidermist Johann Natterer and the landscape painter Thomas Ender. The expedition lasted 18 years aimed to collect all plants, animals, and minerals of scientific interest and bring them back to Vienna.\n\nThe most ambitious Austrian expedition was carried out by the SMS Novara, a frigate which sailed the world between 1857 and 1859. The scientific responsibility for this expedition was shared by the Academy of Sciences and the Geography Society. The man behind the project was Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, Commander in Chief of the Austrian Navy. \n\nAmong the advisors was the famous naturalist and researcher Alexander von Humboldt. Many well-known scientists took part in the two-year journey, including the geologist Ferdinand von Hochstetter, ethnologist Karl von Scherzer and zoologist Georg Ritter von Frauenfeld. The entire journey was documented in hundreds of sketches and paintings by the landscape artist Josef Selleny. The scientists returned home with a vast haul of minerals, animals, plants and items of ethnological interest. \n\nThe last significant research expedition of the 19th century was the Tegetthoff North Pole Expedition (1872 – 1874) led by Julius von Payer and Carl Weyprecht. On August 30, 1873 the participants on board discovered Franz Joseph Land. \n\nWith the Tegetthoff at risk of breaking up under the pressure of the ice, the members of the expedition were forced to leave the ship. On May 20, 1874 they began their long retreat to the south, transporting their equipment and provisions on sleds and boats. \nDespite many sacrifices and great danger, the scientists returned to Vienna with both their invaluable travel journals and observations of the landscape, as well as a number of natural history items of interest welded into metal cases.\n\nFrom 1876, Superintendents:\n\n1876 – 1884 Ferdinand von Hochstetter\n\n1885 – 1896 Franz von Hauer\n\n1896 – 1897 no superintendent, but temporary director: Franz Steindachner\n\n1898 – 1919 Franz Steindachner \n\nFrom 1919, Chairmen of the Museum Council:\n\n1919 – 1922 Ludwig Lorenz von Liburnau\n\n1923 – 1924 Franz Xaver Schaffer \n\nFrom 1924, First Directors\n\n1925 – 1932 Hans Rebel\n\n1933 – 1938 Hermann Michel\n\n1938 – 1939 Otto Pesta, “Acting Director”\n\n1939 – 1945 Hans Kummerlöwe, \"First Director of the Scientific Museums in Vienna\"\n\n1945 – 1951 Hermann Michel\n\n1951 – 1962 Hans Strouhal\n\n1963 – 1971 Karl Heinz Rechinger\n\n1972 – 1978 Friedrich Bachmayer\n\n1979 – 1987 Oliver Paget\n\n1987 – 1994 Heinz A.

However, some of the collections had been moved from even older buildings, such as the Austrian National Library, which contained the Zoology Cabinet (German: \"Tierkabinett\") collections.\n\nThe interaction of the building, its ornate decoration, furniture and precious exhibits makes the museum itself an artifact for historical preservation.\n\nFamous and irreplaceable exhibitsfor instance, the 25,000-year-old Venus of Willendorf, a copy of the skeleton of a \"Diplodocus\" dinosaur (Diplodocus carnegii) (a gift from Andrew Carnegie) and specimens of long-extinct lifeforms such as Steller's sea coware displayed across thirty-nine halls. A contemporary presentation of the exhibits, using modern exhibition technology, has been possible without any destruction of the building's historical structures.\n\nOn the upper floor (\"Hochparterre\") precious stones, minerals (some with origin in old Renaissance collections) and meteorites (the largest display collection in the world) can be seen, along with large dinosaur displays and rare fossils, and along with prehistoric art works: the \"Venus von Willendorf\", the skeleton of \"Diplodocus\", a giant topaz crystal weighing 117 kg (258 lb), and the gemstone-and-diamond bouquet of flowers which Maria Theresia had made as a present for her husband.\n\nThe first floor displays the species variety of the animal world, from protozoa to insects to highly developed mammals. Objects over 200 years old are of interest, not only on their own account but also as historical records for the history of science and the art of taxidermy: numerous stuffed animals of species either extinct, or extremely endangered, have made the collections irreplaceable.\n\nNote that some signs and explanations in the museum are in German, while much of the museum is in German and English following a recent renovation.\n\n\n\n"}

The book documents his own and his family's relationship to the past. This was a significant departure from Walker's academic work in which he is a pre-eminent authority on Australia's engagement with Asia. However, through this book, Walker found that the personal has a role in the writing of history; \"small events also have their place in determining who we are and what we value as individuals and as a community\".\n\n\"Not Dark Yet\" traces the story of Walker's family over five generations; from the settlement of his great-great grandparents in South Australia in the 1850s until the death of his mother in the 1990s. Many of the early chapters are set in Burra, a copper mining town 156 km (97 miles) north of Adelaide, where his family were well-known shopkeepers. Of particular significance is the story of Luke Day, a relative through marriage and a Chinese merchant in Burra. Here the personal narrative intersects with the author's academic interests and Walker uses Day's life to re-examine the position held by the Chinese in Australian society during a period when Australian racial nationalism and the resultant White Australia Policy were strident. Walker captures the essence of life in a small Australian town at the beginning of the twentieth century with all its strengths, limitations and petty jealousies.\n\nIn later sections of the book Walker intimately describes the lives of his parents and his own journey into academia. Australia's engagement with Asia is again given prominence through the description of the devastating effects that the Second World War had on the author's family. When he was a child, Walker was unaware of the fate of uncle Laurie and mention of his name lead to uncomfortable silences. This led Walker to use his historian's skills to investigate Laurie's life. He discovered that his uncle had volunteered for service with the 13th squadron of the RAAF and had been posted to Ambon. He had attempted to escape from the island when it was overrun by the advancing Japanese but through a series of fateful mishaps was captured and executed in the Laha Massacre of Australian prisoners of war. The brutality and apparent pointlessness of Laurie's death resonated in the Walker family over the next two generations. The book also explores the lives of two other uncles whose lives were affected by the war. One served in 467 squadron of the RAAF with Bomber Command and another with the 2/43rd Battalion in North Africa, New Guinea and Borneo. A further poignant episode is Walker's gentle description of his mother's decline into dementia and subsequent death.\n\nDespite these tragedies the book's premise is one of joy and optimism. This is achieved through the author's wit and good-natured humour in the face of misfortune. A single example in the first chapter sets the tone of the book. When his ophthalmologist told him that he was now \"legally blind\", his immediate response was to ask if it was possible for him to be \"illegally blind\" instead.\n\n\"Not Dark Yet\" received an extensive and positive critical response. Kerryn Goldsworthy in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" wrote that \"Not Dark Yet\" was an \"intriguing and engaging book... made even more readable by Walker's personality, which comes across as modest, funny and wry as he tells (his) stories. He's stoic but realistic about his precarious physical state and mildly self-reproaching for having, as a professional historian, undervalued the idea of family history for so long...the book exerts the same powerful grip on the reader as the family chronicles and sagas of good 19th-century fiction and has the same kind of deep, complicated, personal appeal.\" Professor Tom Griffiths of the Australian National University described the book as “a charismatic and enigmatic work... curious, wry, poignant and sweet”. It combined elements of, \"a memoir, a family history, a cultural history of modern Australia, a study of memory, legend and storytelling, an investigation of national character, a local and regional study, a reflection on history and the historian’s craft, an auto-ethnography\".\n\nJennifer Levasseur in \"The Australian\" found Walker to be \"a delightful, witty guide who balances thorough research with banter. While his memoir moves through some of the darkest moments of contemporary and personal history, including World War II atrocities and mental breakdowns, he maintains a fluid, easy style that combines empathy with cheekiness\". Andrew Moore writing in \"Labour History\" discovered interconnections between Walker's family history and his long term academic interests. The stories told in \"Not Dark Yet\" emphasised elements of Australian cultural development and the history of Australia's engagement with Asia. Phillip Adams described the book as “an evocative portrait of 20th century Australia …the attitudes, idiosyncrasies and prejudices of the era.”\n\n"}

{"id": "43031515", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43031515", "title": "Red Sky Poetry Theatre", "text": "Red Sky Poetry Theatre\n\nRed Sky Poetry Theatre was the longest running live weekly poetry series and open mic in Seattle history.\n\nDon Wilsun, who previously co-founded Dogtown Poetry Theater with Joe Scozzy, was a driving force in the founding of Red Sky Poetry Theatre. Along with Joe Keppler, Tom Parson, who also started the Bumbershoot Small Press Fair in 1977, and Judith Roche, whose home was used as a meeting place to plan Red Sky Poetry Theatre, Wilsun formed the core of what would become Red Sky Poetry Theatre. Prior to forming Red Sky Poetry Theatre, Wilsun held ad hoc readings which were simply called Poetry Theatre. Wilsun named his labor of love Red Sky because one day he was putting up flyers for his Poetry Theatre in the Pike Place Market and as he was doing so, saw an amazing red sunset. He wrote a poem at the Soup and Salad called Red Sky. It inspired him to name his Poetry Theatre, Red Sky. The first Red Sky Poetry Theatre reading was May 24, 1981.\n\nBill Shively, Joseph Keppler, Judith Roche, Matt Lennon, and Tom Parsons joined the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board in 1981 and were listed in the original incorporation documents as board members in 1982 with Don Wilsun as President and acting agent. Red Sky Poetry Theatre was a Non-profit Organization existing solely to promote and encourage poetry performance and Performance Art as well as other arts. Elliott Bronstein would join the board a short time later.\n\nTrudy Mercer, an early editor of \"SkyViews\", joined the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board in 1982, the same day Marion Kimes and Michael Hureaux were voted onto the board.\n\nKay Kinghammer and JT Stewart, who formerly taught at Seattle Central Community College, were also part of the early Red Sky Poetry Theatre board.\n\nCharlie Burks, the coordinator of the first Bumbershoot Writers in Performance Competition in 1981, was not officially on the board but collaborated with Red Sky Poetry Theatre on a regular basis. Burks' influence on the collaborative efforts of Red Sky Poetry Theatre was substantial. The expression \"Poet's Gymnasium\", in the context of Red Sky Poetry Theatre as a forum for perfecting one's poetry, is attributed to Burks. Red Sky Poetry Theatre joined Burks in judging the Writers in Performance contests that would decide who, out of hundreds, would read at Bumbershoot. Bumbershoot Writers in Performance Competitions continue to this day, although without Red Sky Poetry Theatre. However, former board member Judith Roche coordinated the Bumbershoot Literary Arts Festival for One Reel after Red Sky Poetry Theatre discontinued the Bumbershoot Association.\n\nBill Shively edited the very first \"Open Sky\" in which writers and visual artists of any sort could contribute 400 pages to be included in the magazine. Red Sky Poetry Theatre considered its collective efforts to be more conducive to the creative process, the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Essentially, \"Open Sky\" wasn't edited so much as compiled. Shively's brainchild, \"Open Sky\", eventually became a quarterly publication. The only person to submit to all twelve issues of \"Open Sky\" was author Dann O'Keefe. \"Open Sky\" became \"Open Sound\" in 1989 with 200 pages. Ezra Mark was the editor of the first \"Open Sound\". Ezra Mark was later on the board of Subtext, another poetry series.\n\nShively created and edited the early \"SkyViews\" magazine which started out as a monthly newsletter with 'guest editors' but became a full-fledged poetry magazine shortly after the first issues. Charlie Burks added a 'Sunday Supplement' one month when he was guest editor that was much admired by the Pacific Northwest literary public. Trudy Mercer took over the compilation of this monthly magazine in 1984. Mercer published \"Redlines\" as well as working with Red Sky Poetry Theatre. \"SkyViews\" was renamed \"Parallel Discourse\" in 1989 with Phoebe Bosché and James Maloney as editors although it still referred to itself as \"SkyViews\" inside the first \"Parallel Discourse\" pages. \"Parallel Discourse\" soon spun off of Red Sky Poetry Theatre completely and was solely published by Bosché and Maloney.\n\"Swale Magazine\" was edited by Bosché and Roberto Valenza but it was not actually a Red Sky Poetry Theatre publication. \"Swale\" was well received.\n\nWhen Don Wilsun withdrew from regular participation in Red Sky Poetry Theatre, the Secretary of State of Washington State listed Elliott Bronstein as the acting Agent for Red Sky Poetry Theatre and Marion Kimes as the acting President and Treasurer. Red Sky Poetry Theatre presented a continuous live poetry series for more than the 25 years that it was incorporated. This puts Red Sky Poetry Theatre on the same par as City Lights Books, which has been running a poetry series since 1953, and Nuyorican Poets Cafe, which has had a series since 1973. Red Sky Poetry Theatre still does occasional Red Sky Redux at the Hopvine Pub or venues such as the Richard Hugo House. Red Sky Poetry Theatre board membership changed much over the course of 25 incorporated years.\n\nRed Sky Poetry Theatre held their first readings at the Soames Dunn Building in the Pike Place Market and continued there for more than a year, then moving to the Pike Development Authority meeting room for 6 months. From there, Red Sky Poetry Theatre stayed in the Pike Place Market and started reading in December, 1983 at the Soup and Salad Cafe overlooking Puget Sound. This was the first venue where people who weren't looking for Red Sky Poetry Theatre could come across them and walk in.\n\nMichael Hureaux, who was an active member of Red Sky Poetry Theatre, was the instigator that convinced Red Sky Poetry Theatre to move to the Five-O Tavern on Capitol Hill in December 1984, thus changing the ambiance of the performance stage, when the Soup and Salad turned into the Soundview Cafe. Hureaux had already staged Poem People: Poetry Night at the Five-O Tavern and found the location conducive to poetry. (The Five-O later became the Hopvine Pub). The Five-O was an early venue for the fledgling Seattle Grunge Rock scene. It is among venues where the influence of Steven Jesse Bernstein, on Grunge first occurred. Bernstein had been reading at Dogtown Poetry Theater prior to Red Sky Poetry Theatre and was always an influence in Seattle and the West Coast.\n\nHureaux left the board in 1986 to pursue other interests, including becoming a member of the Choreopoets.\n\nThe renowned Pioneer Square Theater hosted Red Sky Poetry Theatre Works In Progress such as Charlie Burks \"War Babies\", in 1983 and 1984. Pioneer Square Theater continued working with Red Sky Poetry Theatre affiliated authors such as Roberto Valenza, although the connections with Red Sky Poetry Theatre were no longer direct.\n\nIn fact, Red Sky Poetry Theatre was so involved with the Seattle performance culture, that it was hard to tell where Red Sky Poetry Theatre ended and another organization began. Members worked with On the Boards performing in the 1982 Poetry Marathon to benefit Amnesty International. Matt Lennon hosted a monthly reading at the Comet Tavern, where Red Sky Poetry Theatre would cross pollinate with the Actor's Table. Joe Keppler hosted readings at the Greenwood Gallery before he left in 1983 to form \"Poets, Painters, Composers\" It was this flexibility which made it so easy to move venues as needed without harming the free-spirited, collaborative nature of Red Sky Poetry Theatre.\n\nPhoebe Bosché and Roberto Valenza became Red Sky Poetry Theatre board members in 1984 and were influential in taking Red Sky Poetry Theatre in new directions toward Performance Poetry. Bosché recently edited Art and Politics Now Cultural Activism in a Time of Crisis. Bosché currently publishes \"Raven Chronicles\" with Philip H. Red Eagle.\nValenza, was a flamboyant character, who along with Bernstein, Gary Heffern, and others, encouraged heckling of his readings. Heckling gave a spontaneity and comedic value to performances although many of the other readers frowned upon it.\nThe 1980s found Red Sky Poetry Theatre receiving grants from the King County Arts Commission,<ref name=\"Alternative 8/4\">Alternative to Load Boats Set for August 4, \"The Arts; King County Arts Commission Newsletter Volume 20 Number 5\", July 1991</ref> the Allied Arts Foundation, the Seattle Arts Commission and 911 Media Arts Center, which allowed Red Sky Poetry Theatre to expand into other media.\n\nThere were two radio shows affiliated with Red Sky Poetry Theatre in the early years, both on KRAB-FM from 1981 through 1983. There was Red Sky Radio hosted by Matt Lennon and Art Talk hosted by Don Wilsun.\n\nRed Sky Poetry Theatre would branch off into Public Access Television hosted by TCI Cable in 1985 starting with the Paramount Poets by Alan Goodin and Martina Poth Goodin, both Red Sky Poetry Theatre board members since 1984. They would continue the tradition of video poetry with Cactus Poets, the show starting production in 1987. Red Sky Poetry Theatre Live would air, also on TCI, in 1988. These three video poetry series aired frequently until 1992.\n\nmargareta waterman (lowercase intentional) would join the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board in 1989, bringing with her nine muses books and producing Manifest Arts, a series of Poetry and Performance Art broadcast on TCI. nine muses published many Red Sky Poetry Theatre authors. waterman left the board in 1994 to travel and perform around the country.\n\nMembers of Red Sky Poetry Theatre were instrumental in creating An Alternative To Loud Boats, which was a Performance Art event that coincided with the Seattle Seafair Albert Lee Cup Hydroplane Races, started in 1985. It soon had a different theme every year such as 'Censorship' or 'Sanctuary' (from the first Iraq War). Between 1988 and 1991, Alternative to Loud Boats was helped along by grants from the King County Arts Commission written by Cydney Gillis of \"Arts Focus\". \"Arts Focus\" was a popular Seattle magazine dedicated to the Northwest literary and performance culture. Alternative to Loud Boats continued for ten years until 1994.\n\nMany musicians worked with Red Sky Poetry Theatre, including Wally Shoup, who improvised saxophone on stage with poets and Michael Monhart, also a saxophonist. Pete Leinonen recorded many of the Red Sky poets along with The Pete Leinonen Band. The Bill Shively Band, was a mainstay of Red Sky Poetry Theatre from the beginning. Don Wilsun, himself, played the congas and would often recite as he drummed. There are recordings of much of this work, as well as recordings of spoken word.\n\nFor all of the influence Red Sky Poetry Theatre had on the West Coast and national literary world, it was still considered \"underground\" by the academic establishment. This was due to the controversial nature of many of the performers as Red Sky Poetry Theatre allowed anyone to openly state anything about the society within we live. Many of these performers would have no formal academic training. Not everyone liked this approach but it would prove to be paramount to the success of Red Sky Poetry Theatre.\n\nKaren Finneyfrock was one of the Red Sky Poetry Theatre featured readers who would become MC of the Seattle Poetry Slam between 2001 and 2005. Red Sky Poetry Theatre poets were more cooperative at first and not competitive as the Slams were. (The only competitions Red Sky Poetry Theatre would do would be to decide who would be reading at the Bumbershoot Literary Festival. Hundreds applied.) Kathleen Daviduke AKA Katushka, a frequent reader at Open Mics, would win a place in the 1992 \"Poetry Bus: The Metro Moving Poetry Series\". Matthew Stadler also was a frequent featured reader. Ira Cohen, Sam Hamill and many other well known readers read at Red Sky Poetry Theatré. The list of influential or award winning poets who read at Red Sky Poetry Theatre is extensive.\n\nWhile Red Sky Poetry Theatre was housed at the Ditto Tavern in the early 1990s, it had such an effect on the Belltown neighborhood that the local art magazine, \"Belltown's Brain Fever Dispatch\" would dedicate a full page to Red Sky Poetry Theatre for several months in the early 1990s.\n\nRed Sky would continue with board members leaving and new members joining. Peter Sawicki AKA Tobeimean Peter would join the board in 1985 bringing his artistic flare to the \"Open Sky\" magazine with his images on the cover. Peter left the following year to pursue his art. Martina and Alan Goodin would leave in 1992 and Trudy Mercer, instrumental in the publication of early \"SkyViews\" and \"Open Sound\", would leave in 1994. Stephen Thomas, who owned Cabaret Hegel which was a performance venue from 84 to 87, would become active in Red Sky Poetry Theatre. Although Thomas was not officially on the board, in 1981 he was a judge for the Bumbershoot Literary Competition. Thomas continued working closely with Red Sky Poetry Theatre until 1997. Steve Potter would join the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board in 1994 and stayed until the end.\n\nPaul Hunter was an intrinsic member of the board, but left in 2004, the year before the last reading. Paul Nelson, who was also a DJ at KPLU-FM and KNDD-FM as well as other stations, would become a Red Sky Poetry Theatre board member in 1997. Nelson was on the board at the end.\nNelson, Bachman, Bart Baxter, another Red Sky Poetry Theatre board member from 1989 through 91, and board member Clarice Keegan were also on the board of the now disbanded Washington Poets Association. Keegan had previously been on the Seattle Poetry Slam board before joining Red Sky Poetry Theatre.\n\nJesse Minkert would join the board in 1998 and stayed until the end. Minkert recorded readings at the Globe Cafe and released a CD called \"Red Sky At Night: Poets in Seattle\" in 2002. Others associated with the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board at this time were Diane Westergaard, who was on the board for a year starting in 2004, Allison Durazzi, also on the board, Belle Randall, a frequent featured reader, David Lloyd Whited, whose book \"3 & 1\" was published by Red Sky Press, and many others continued the Red Sky Poetry Theatre tradition of an unfettered open mic.\n\nDon Wilsun, who according to Trudy Mercer was the 'Father of Red Sky Poetry Theatre', stayed on the board until 2001 although he started to participate much less after 1991. He died on May 8, 2003, taking with him much of the original Spirit of Red Sky Poetry Theatre. Wilsun's work is now in an Archive at the University of Washington.\nRoberto Valenza left the World on January 19, 2010 leaving much of his work to the University of Washington.\nMarion Kimes, the Grande Dame and guiding light of Red Sky Poetry Theatre, died on March 13, 2014.\n\nBill Shively, founding member of Red Sky Poetry Theatre, who formed the Bill Shively Band and others, died on September 28, 2014.\n\nThe works of everyone affiliated with Red Sky Poetry Theatre or nine muses books is being archived at the University of Washington. Most of this growing body of works by various authors, musicians, and artists has not yet been digitized. (A History about Red Sky Poetry Theatre written for that collection, contains inaccuracies which are corrected in this document.)\n\nRed Sky Poetry Theatre went through many venues after it left the Five-O Tavern in the late 1980s. It moved to the Cause Celebre Cafe, also on Capitol Hill, for a few months, then moved to the Still Life Cafe in Fremont, 'The Center of the Universe'. It moved to Anna's Cafe briefly. From there Red Sky Poetry Theatre moved around but landed at Squid Row in the late 1980s. It showed in other venues, as well, moving in 1990 to the Ditto Tavern in Belltown, Seattle. Once the Ditto Tavern folded, Red Sky Poetry Theatre moved back up to Capitol Hill to the Globe Cafe. Robin Schultz, owner of the Globe Cafe, also published Poetry Around Press which published many Red Sky Poetry Theatre authors. In 2005, the Globe changed hands and the last continuous Red Sky Poetry Theatre reading was on October 23, 2005.\nPaul Nelson, Teresa Bachman AKA Alley Greymond, who was on the Red Sky Poetry Theatre board between 1996 and 1998, Phoebe Bosché, and others have brought back Red Sky Poetry for occasional special events called Red Sky Redux.\n"}

The method is an essential hedonistic aspect of the aesthetic way of life.\n\nKierkegaard likens the rotation method to the crop rotation used in agriculture, in which the soil is constantly rotated in order to maximize the use of nutrients for the crops. For the aesthete, one constantly changes what one is doing in order to maximize the enjoyment and pleasure derived from each activity.\n\nA consequence of the rotation method would be the aesthete's lack of commitment to any one thing. Commitment requires one to constantly repeat an activity; however, for the aesthetic, repeating an activity leads to boredom, as this activity is no longer novel.\n\nThe rotation method, Kierkegaard argues, would eventually lead aesthetes to a state of despair, because all activities, no matter how unique or new, will eventually become boring:\n\nThe aesthete, Kierkegaard predicts, realizing and responding to the futility of one's hedonistic finite aims, will yearn to experience a more meaningful life.\n\n"}

Mahmassani (, January 29, 1909 – September 10, 1986) was a Lebanese legal scholar, practising lawyer, judge, and political figure helped to build the legal and civic foundations of the then-nascent country of Lebanon, and whose writings on Islamic jurisprudence remain authoritative works on this topic for legal scholars and researchers.\n\nMahmassani was born in Beirut, Lebanon to Rajab Mahmassani and Aisha Khoja. He and his three male and five female siblings pursued higher education. In 1940, he married Ismat Abdul Kader Inkidar, with whom he had four sons: Ghaleb (1941), Malek (1944), Maher (1947) and Hani (1956).\n\nWith the onset of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975, Mahmassani struggled to maintain his professional activities in Lebanon and overseas as a legal consultant and international arbitrator. After 1983 his activities slowed down as he was diagnosed with lung cancer, of which he died in Paris, where he was pursuing medical treatment, on September 10, 1986.\n\nMahmassani commenced primary and high school education in Beirut during World War I at the Preparatory School of the Syrian Evangelical College (now known as International College), a preparatory school for the American University of Beirut. He graduated from the high school in 1924 with high marks, and was designated valedictorian of his class.\n\nHe pursued legal studies at the law school of University of Lyon in France from which he graduated with a License en Droit (law degree) followed by a doctorate in law in 1932. He joined the school of law of the London University and obtained bachelors in law degree in English law in 1935. As a result, he was well-versed in both French (Latin) and Anglo-Saxon legal traditions.\n\nMahmassani was fluent in Arabic, English and French; he also had a reading knowledge of German.\n\nMahmassani started his judicial career in 1929, during the French Mandate over Lebanon, as a court clerk while he was still pursuing his higher education. He served as judge at progressively higher ranks in various locations of Lebanon until he became counselor at the mixed court of appeals in Beirut (in that period, higher courts were presided by French judges). Following the independence of Lebanon, Mahmassani became president of the civil chamber of the court of appeals and cassation of Beirut, the then highest judicial instance in the country.\n\nMahmassani took early retirement from his judicial career toward the end of 1946 to start a professional career as a lawyer.\n\nIn early 1947, Mahmassani founded a law firm in Beirut and became an attorney. That career continued until his death in 1986. During that period, Mahmassani was appointed to lead a number of international arbitrations, some in highly visible cases.\n\nThe Mahmassani family is noted for its contributions to public life. On May 6, 1916 (Martyrs' Day), Sobhi's first cousins Mohammad and Mahmoud Mahmassani were publicly executed in what is now called Martyrs' Square, Beirut by Jamal Pasha, the Ottoman wāli of Greater Syria, because of their nationalist activities.\n\nIn 1944, Mahmassani was appointed as member of the Lebanese delegation to the founding of the Arab League in Alexandria, Egypt, in the capacity of legal advisor.\n\nIn 1945, he was appointed as member of the Lebanese delegation to the founding of the United Nations in San Francisco, USA, in the capacity of legal advisor. His role was recognized in a 2013 exhibition at the American University of Beirut.\nMahmassani contributed to the modernization of Lebanese legislation and the creation of state institutions through his participation in the higher committee appointed for that purpose by President Fuad Chehab upon his election as President of the Republic in 1958.\nIn the Lebanese general election, 1964, Mahmassani was elected to a four-year term as member of the Lebanese Parliament representing the capital city Beirut. He did not seek re-election.\n\nIn 1966, he was appointed minister of national economy in the Lebanese government presided by Abdallah El-Yafi, a position he occupied until 1968.\n\nIn parallel with his professional legal and political careers, Mahmassani had an academic career that spanned from the late 1930s to the late 1970s.\n\nHe joined the faculty of the American University of Beirut in 1936 and continued until 1964; over which period he taught several courses, namely Roman law, the laws of the Arab countries and Islamic law.\n\nAround the same time, Mahmassani also joined the faculty of the law school of Saint Joseph University in Beirut where he taught the comparative legal systems of the Arab countries.\n\nMahmassani was a founder of the Lebanese University and its law school in the early 1960s; he was thus among its first professors teaching Islamic law.\n\nMahmassani also joined the faculty of the law school of the Beirut Arab University when it opened its doors in Beirut.\n\nFinally, Mahmassani taught law courses at the Military Academy in Lebanon. During a certain period, Mahmassani was lecturing at five universities.\n\nAs part of his academic career, Mahmassani visited a number of countries to give lectures as a visiting professor (such as in the US, the Netherlands, Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Tunisia) or as participant in international conferences (such as in the US, France, Italy, Egypt, Iraq). In particular, in the summer of 1966, he gave a series of lectures at the Hague Academy of International Law on International law and relations in Islam.\n\nHe was elected as a Member of the Arab Academies of Damascus, Cairo and Baghdad.\n\nAs a scholar of Islamic law, Mahmassani was noted for being open-minded towards other cultures and faiths, and is frequently quoted in discussions of \"Liberal Islam\". He actively participated in international conferences on cultural exchanges and inter-faith dialogue. Most notable were his participation in the UNESCO conferences in Florence, Italy (1950) and Paris, France (1953); the Colloquium on Islamic Culture in Princeton, US (September 1953); the conferences on Muslim - Christian cooperation in Tehran, Iran (1957) and Bhamdoun, Lebanon (1954).\n\nCitations to his work appear in many scholarly books and articles on Islamic law, e.g. \"Shari_a: Islamic Law in the Contemporary Context\", \"Islam in Transition, Muslim Perspectives\", and J. Schacht's \"An Introduction to Islamic Law\". His work on the legal aspects of human rights, from the perspective of different legal systems, is a source for scholars of international affairs.\nIn a review, published in the \"Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies\", of the first English translation of Mahmassani’s classic reference \"Falsafat Al-Tashri' Fi Al-Islām, The Philosophy of Jurisprudence in Islam\" (translated into English by Farhat Ziadeh), Anderson refers to Mahmassani as a \"leading Lebanese lawyer of the modern school\", stating \"Professor Mahmassani has … a wide knowledge both of European and Islamic law; he has provided a number of admirable examples of such phenomena as changes in the law authored by early Caliphs or approved by classical jurists; his statements are well-documented; and his remarks…-and indeed most of his summary of the law of evidence are admirable.\"\n\nA number of honours have been awarded to Mahmassani in Lebanon and abroad in recognition of his contributions. Upon his passing in 1986, he was posthumously awarded the National Order of the Cedar by the President of Lebanon.\n\nSeveral obituaries and testimonials highlighting Mahmassani's influence as a legal scholar have appeared in Arabic publications; an English language biographical note appears in the \"Middle East Commercial Law Review\". A 25th Anniversary obituary was published (in Arabic) in the \"Al Liwaa\" newspaper.\n\nMahmassani authored books in Islamic law. A complete list of his books is included below.

The neighborhood is generally bounded between Front Street and Seventh Street and includes Pine Street and is known for its \"bohemian\", \"punk\", and generally \"alternative\" atmosphere. It is one of Philadelphia's largest tourist attractions. \n\nIn 2014, the area's population was 27,805. The average age for the neighborhood is 34.9, with 57.44% of the population between the ages of 18 to 44 and 62.3% of the population are renters with the average income of $71,856.\n\nAccording to City Data, the area has 1,248 males and 1,196 females.\n\nThe district spans the following areas:\n\nThe neighborhood significantly overlaps with Queen Village, Washington Square West, Bella Vista, and Society Hill.\n\nOriginally the southern border of William Penn's 1682 city plan and officially named Cedar Street until 1854, eastern South Street has been the center of local Swedish, Dutch, Jewish, Irish, and Italian immigrant culture as well as a vibrant African-American neighborhood beginning in the early 1800s. Because Quaker doctrine opposed live performances within the city limits, the first permanent theater in America was built on the south side of the street at Leithgow Street, giving birth to a tradition of Philadelphians seeking out entertainment on South Street that continues today.\n\nIn 1854, the same year that South Street officially became South Street, the city boundaries were redrawn to expand the area of Philadelphia to 130 square miles. Despite no longer being a literal border, South Street remained a liminal space where cultures collided. The African-American theater district of western South Street, the Jewish shops, nearby Italian businesses, and visitors from other parts of the city combined to create a place described by William Gardner Smith in his 1954 book \"South Street\" as a lively zone of contact between many different ethnicities. \nFrom the early 1960s to the 1970s, South Street was filled with clubs and bars that fostered a growing nightlife. During this time, the neighborhood also served as an artists' haven and a hub of Beat subculture and, later, 1960s counterculture, bohemianism, and the hippie movement in Philadelphia, establishing a lasting association of South Street with avant-garde and alternative subcultures. \n\nIt was not uncommon for South Philadelphians to \"bar-hop\" across the clubs, listening to live bands along the way. This community of fans helped attract recording contracts for many artists, including Kenn Kweder, the \"bard of South Street\"; George Thorogood; and Robert Hazard. From the mid to late 1970s into the 1980s, South Street's reputation as a musical, artistic, and countercultural hub was further solidified as it became the center of Philadelphia's punk scene and punk and alternative rock music communities, with venues such as JC Dobbs and stores such as Zipperhead catering to the burgeoning scene. \n\nIn 1976, Jim's Steaks of West Philadelphia expanded to 400 South Street, becoming the notable restaurant's first franchise.\n\nIn the late 1980s, South Street became one of the city's main tourist attractions anchored by the Theatre of Living Arts (TLA) which began as an arthouse theater and then was reborn as a live music venue. Tourists flocked to the South Street's nightlife and the \"neighborhood\" community aspect was gradually lost.\n\nSouth Street remains a popular hangout area for teens, college students, and twentysomethings with its assortment of bars, take-out eateries, sex shops, gift shops, and retailers catering to hip hop fashion, punk fashion, and/or urban culture. A few restaurants and independent boutiques targeting a slightly more mature clientele are interspersed with these businesses, such as Accent on Animals, a pet supply store, and South Street Souvlaki, a Greek restaurant. Starting in the late 1990s, the street saw the establishment of various chain stores, including Johnny Rockets, two Starbucks locations, Häagen-Dazs, Rita's Italian Ice, Super Fresh, Whole Foods, CVS, and Fine Wine & Good Spirits. South Street is adjacent to Headhouse Square, a notable plaza with various shops and restaurants.\n\nArtist Isaiah Zagar has made South Street his home since the late 1960s and his mosaic work can be seen in multiple places along South Street including his large installation Philadelphia's Magic Gardens between 10th Street and 11th Street.\n\nThe Orlons, a music group from Philadelphia, released a 1963 song based on (and entitled) South Street, which begins with the line \"Where do all the hippies meet?\" Another Philadelphia-area band, The Dovells also mentioned South Street in their 1963 hit \"You Can't Sit Down\".\n\nPhiladelphia band Need New Body has a song called \"So St RX\" which is about South Street.\n\nFear's 1982 song \"I Don't Care About You\", which name-checks the neighborhoods associated with the punk movement in the United States in the early 1980s, begins with the line, \"I'm from South Street Philadelphia\" (also relevant to writer/vocalist Lee Ving who was born in the city).\n\nThe Dead Milkmen's 1988 song \"Punk Rock Girl\" makes references to Zipperhead (a punk rock/alternative clothing and accessories store) and The Philadelphia Pizza Company., Ltd, both of which were located on South Street. Portions of the video for this song were filmed on South Street. Zipperhead has since relocated to South 4th St. and been renamed to Crash Bang Boom. A few years after Zipperhead founder and building landlord Rick Millan sold the business to local musician Rob Windfelder of the rock band Live Not On Evil and his business partner Stefanie Jollis, the store was relocated and renamed.\n\nGreen Day made their Philadelphia debut on January 23, 1993 at J.C. Dobbs on the 300 block of South Street. The band had not yet signed with Reprise and the club oversold the 125-capacity venue. Late arrivals paid to enter the second floor and watch the live video feed. During the third song of the set, a young woman had a seizure, the show was halted, and police ended the concert and cleared the venue.\n\nBoyz II Men's debut song and video \"Motownphilly\" was partially filmed on South Street and the location is referenced in the song.\n\nSinger songwriter Jake Laufer's 2009 rockabilly song, \"Center City,\" about a guy from Tennessee coming north to meet up with his Philly-based girlfriend, features several South Street landmarks, including Lorenzo's Pizza and Famous 4th Street Deli.\nThe HBO comedy special \"The Diceman Cometh\", starring comedian Andrew Dice Clay, was recorded at South Street's Theater of the Living Arts (and was mentioned in the special by Clay).\n\nThe block of South Street between 5th and 6th Street is shown in the opening credits of the FX Network show \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\".\n\nPhiladelphia native Will Smith makes mention in his song \"Getting Jiggy with it\" in the lyric \"livin' that life some consider a myth,\nrock from south street to one two fifth\".\n\nSouth Street is served by the William M.

{"id": "13531879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13531879", "title": "The Suffering of God", "text": "The Suffering of God\n\nThe Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective is a book by Old Testament scholar Terence E. Fretheim. In 1984 it appeared as number 14 in the Overtures to Biblical Theology series published by Fortress Press.\n\nMost Christians believe the incarnation of God is an exclusively New Testament idea, but in \"The Suffering of God: An Old Testament Perspective\", Terence E. Fretheim argues that incarnation has always been God's standard method of interaction with humanity. Through exegesis and a literary and philosophical approach to Scripture, Fretheim draws the elusive God of the Old Testament close. Indeed, the author seeks to balance the common images of God as wrathful judge or cold lawgiver with an image of God in relationship with humanity. According to Fretheim, God suffers because He has completely and intimately bound Himself in relation to the created world, especially His people Israel.\n\nFretheim defends his thesis by claiming that \"metaphors matter\" and appealing to biblical images of an immanent deity. For him, the most significant metaphors for God in the Old Testament are anthropomorphic. If man is created in the image of God, he argues, then we have \"permission to reverse the process and, by looking at the human, learn what God is like\" (p. 11). The human metaphor is presented as the dominant expression of God's nature and character. The author says that many aspects of humanity are not appropriate for describing God. Sexuality, death, sinfulness, etc. are aspects of human nature that should not be ascribed to God. These \"ungodly\" aspects of humanity have moved some Christians to dismiss anthropomorphic descriptions of God out of hand, but Fretheim argues that the human metaphor is so pervasive and appropriate that it acts as a sort of guide, directing the reader as to the proper way to understand all non-human metaphors.\n\nThe human metaphor has been long neglected in Fretheim's opinion, but he sees feminist theology, liberation / Black theology, and the theological response to catastrophic events of the twentieth century as positive responses to this neglect. The problem, he says, is that too many theologians are doing their own exegesis, and they are bringing ideas to the text which cannot be supported. He argues that biblical scholars, biased by their theology, have largely ignored texts concerning God's repentance, downplayed anthropomorphic descriptions of God, and misunderstood issues relating to divine foreknowledge. Fretheim believes that an unbiased view will be more pluralistic and more willing to incorporate the relational aspects of the Old Testament God.\n\nThe first traditional view that Fretheim seeks to undermine, or perhaps more accurately to bring balance to, is the idea of divine transcendence. He argues that both the monarchical and organismic views are present in scripture, but that the organismic, immanent image is dominant. This “relationship of reciprocity” (p. 35) between God and the world is the foundation for all of Fretheim's conclusions. God affects and is affected by the world He has created, and this relationship is key to understanding what kind of God He is.\n\nThe second widely held position that Fretheim challenges is the doctrine of divine omniscience. (chapter 4) Fretheim uses solid biblical exegesis to argue compellingly against a view (at least in the Old Testament) which classifies omniscience as one of God's fundamental characteristics. Divine foreknowledge, he believes, is limited because of God's relationship with creation. There is no doubt, he says, that God always knows what He will do in the future, but He does not always know what free moral agents outside of Himself will do. For Fretheim, the widespread use of words like “perhaps” and “if” in divine speech point to a lack of certainty in God's mind about the future. God's bargain with Abraham over Sodom is an excellent example of God's mind being open to change depending on the unforeseen actions of human beings. The issue of foreknowledge is not presented as complex or difficult. Rather, Fretheim quickly lays out his argument and in less than fifteen pages and moves on to the addresses the issue of God's presence in the world. (chapter 5) While acknowledging that God is everywhere at all times in a structural or general presence, Fretheim describes what he calls, the “intensification of the divine presence.” This intensity of presence can be affected positively or negatively by human beings. Fretheim argues that sin drives away God (as in Ezekiel 8:6) and actually results in the intensification of divine presence in the form of God's wrath. Conversely, righteousness or “receptiveness” can move God to draw near.\n\nThe most intense experience of God's presence occurs in the form of theophany. In what is probably Fretheim's most controversial chapter (chapter 6), he describes the appearances of God in the Old Testament and the human reaction to them. To Fretheim, the spoken word delivered by God is no more important than the appearance itself, the visible word, as he calls it. He suggests that modern theologians need to broaden their understanding of the Word of God to include the visual aspects of revelation as well as the spoken/written word.\nFretheim makes a thorough examination of several different Old Testament theophanies noting their similarities and differences before coming to his surprising conclusion: All theophanies involve God taking on human form (chapter 6). Theologically, this is key for Fretheim. The consistent use of human form shows God's vulnerability. It proves that there is nothing fundamentally ungodly about the human form, and it shows that “the finite form is capable of the infinite.” (p. 102) In wrestling with the theological implications of such a statement, Fretheim questions whether God uses the human form for the sake of appearances or whether there is a fundamental continuity between the two. Not surprisingly, he argues for the latter position, and from the argument establishes that God is fundamentally connected to His creation and that He is fundamentally vulnerable because of this relationship. This leads to his actual discussion of the suffering of God.\n\nIn three short chapters Fretheim describes God as suffering because of His creation (chapter 7), for His creation (chapter 8), and with His creation (chapter 9) . These chapters flow logically out of the groundwork established in the first one hundred pages of the text. Each chapter is neatly summarized in numbered points making it easy to review and synthesize.\nThe final chapter of Fretheim's book deals with the special relationship between the suffering God and His suffering servants, the prophets. In men like Jeremiah, the divine word is incarnated to the point that the prophet shares in the divine suffering and God shares in the prophets suffering. The lives of the prophets are tied up in the divine life to the point that they embody the word of God in their lives as well as their words. The suffering servant in Isaiah experiences the same phenomenon as prophets like Moses and Jeremiah, but in him, Fretheim sees another level intensification of presence. Despite his strong claims about the shared suffering of the prophets and God, Fretheim acknowledges that in the Old Testament God Himself did not become completely incarnate in an entire human life. That act is reserved for the incarnation of Jesus Christ, but Fretheim sees it, not as something radically new, but as “the culmination of a long-standing relationship of God with the world that is much more widespread in the OT than is commonly recognized.”\n\nFretheim's work is incredibly successful at accomplishing its stated purpose of bringing balance to the church's image of God in the Old Testament. He powerfully synthesizes the work of feminist, liberation, and process theologians while relying firmly on his expertise as a biblical exegete. The real strength of this work is that Fretheim manages to make many of the same critiques common to these movements without sounding like a feminist or a liberation theologian. While he acknowledges their influence on him, the author's tone and focus remain overtly biblical throughout the book.\n\nFretheim brings an air of authority and experience in the task of exegesis that is missing in the works of systematic theologians addressing the same issues. Influences like Abraham Heschel help him keep Christian bias to a minimum when approaching the Old Testament text. Furthermore, he does not limit himself to one or two proof texts to support his position. On the contrary, I found myself flipping through my Bible constantly while reading his work. He challenges the reader to draw theology from the biblical text rather than to allow our preconceived ideas about God to distort our reading of the Old Testament.\nFretheim's book is a marvelous example of inductive logical organization and rational approach to a complex topic. His argument is well-formed and easy to follow. The reader may be confused as to why a book called \"The Suffering of God\" takes over one hundred pages to actually discuss any pain endured by the deity, but Fretheim is not rushed into embracing a position before laying the biblical and philosophical groundwork necessary to support that position. Indeed, laying the foundation is the difficult part. After chapter six, the reader already anticipates the conclusion.\n\nThe author is conversant with a wide range of modern scholarship as evidenced by his excellent endnotes and bibliography. The relative brevity of the book is amazing considering the wide range of topics addressed. Here again, Fretheim's organizational skills are at work. When a related but unessential issue arises, he usually adds a note to refer the reader to good sources on the topic and continues on without interrupting his argument.\nOne of the nicest things about this work is its energetic and engaging style. Fretheim hopes this book will change the church's view of God in the Old Testament, and readability is essential to influencing preachers and teachers within churches. The provocative nature of the topic and Fretheim's willingness to make bold claims leads the reader into dialogue with the text. Ward characterizes it as “bold and challenging, inviting vigorous response,” saying that the margins of his review copy are “filled with comments” While the content is too technical for direct use in most church settings, the ideas that Fretheim lays out can easily be transferred to a sermon or Bible class. Certainly, The Suffering of God is not a popular level book, but it is also not so technical as to exclude ministers or seminary students from its audience.\n\nWhile reviews have been very positive, they have raised three serious critiques of the work. First, in his effort to emphasize the imminent and relational nature of God, Fretheim neglects to adequately address themes like holiness as a balance to his relational theology. Without the tension provided by God's holiness, relational theology can be pushed too far, and Fretheim sometimes is guilty of this. Dale Patrick points out that while Fretheim does not deny that much of the God-talk in the Old Testament does fit into the traditional paradigms which emphasize holiness, sovereignty, and transcendence he ignores these elements claiming that the organismic is predominant. Patrick argues that the task of biblical theology is to present a comprehensive image of God rather than simply a prominent one. Some have claimed that Fretheim's process theology (a term Fretheim himself never embraces) is to blame for the lack of material on holiness. However, given Fretheim's presupposition that transcendence and sovereignty have been overemphasized, it is easy to see why he doesn’t spend time affirming them. His stated goal is not to replace ideas of holiness, but to bring balance to them.\nAs previously stated, Fretheim uses a wide variety of texts to support his position, but the vast majority of these come from the Psalms and the prophetic literature. As Elizabeth Bellefontaine notes, Israel's wisdom traditions are conspicuously absent. Despite his heavy criticism of those who “remove certain materials from the OT theological repertoire” for the purposes of theological convergence (p. 20), Fretheim himself offers a nod to the wisdom literature and then completely ignores it. This would be less relevant were it not for the fact that much of the wisdom literature stands in tension if not opposition to his own theology.\n\nWhile Fretheim's catch phrase, “Metaphors matter,” can be universally affirmed, he is sometimes guilty of thinking that they matter too much. This leads him at time to engage in an overly literal reading of scripture. Metaphors reveal God to us, but they are not God himself. “The modern interpreter’s challenge, which is not adequately confronted in this book, is to discern how the Old Testament understood its metaphors.” He overstates his case when discussing incarnational metaphor and theodicy. White says, “There is no need for Fretheim to argue (as he does) that all theophanies were in human form in order to substantiate the interrelationship between theophanic motif and the prophet.” Saying that a human figure can be inferred within the pillar of cloud or the burning bush (p. 94–95) is speculative at best, and Fretheim doesn’t need it to advance his argument. \n\n"}

Ippen belonged to the group of Albanologists who published their works on Albania through the state-financed institutes of Austria-Hungary in order to create the Albanian national consciousness which he believed would be beneficial for Dual Monarchy. Ippen supported the establishment of an independent nation-state of Albanians. He served as diplomat in Shkoder, Pljevlja, Istanbul, Jerusalem, Athens and London where he advised ambassador of Austria-Hungary during London Conference which ended with signing of the London treaty and a decision to establish the Principality of Albania reached on 29 July 1913. During the period between 1921 and 1927, he was a member of the International Danube Commission.\n\nIppen was born on 29 November 1861 to a family of baptized Jews in Sezemice.\n\nIppen studied the oriental languages and economics at the Oriental Academy in Vienna. He started his career of diplomat serving at the consulate of Austria-Hungary in Ottoman held Shkodër in Albania between 1884 and 1887. At the end of 1887 he was appointed as Austro-Hungarian diplomat in Pljevlja (vice-consul), Istanbul (1891—1893) and Jerusalem (1893—1895), Istanbul (1895—1897), and again in Shkodër (1897—1904).\n\nIn the period from 1905 to 1909 he continued his diplomatic career in Athens, Greece, and after 1909 in London, where he advised the ambassador of Austria-Hungary during the London Conference, which was intended to arbitrate between the combatants in the First Balkan War. In 1912 Ippen prepared an ethnographic map of the Albanian-populated areas of Ottoman Empire, which was submitted by the Austro-Hungarian ambassador during the London Conference as a basis for the border negotiations. After the London treaty has been signed the ambassadors of six Great Powers decided, in July 1913, to constitute a new state, Albania, as a hereditary principality. In period between 1921 and 1927 he was a member of the International Danube Commission.\n\nIppen belonged to the group of Albanologists whose works were published through the state-financed institutes of Austria-Hungary. He participated in the writing and dissemination of the first history of Albania published in the Albanian language because he insisted that creating Albanian national consciousness would be beneficial for the Dual Monarchy. Ippen struggled for the establishment of an independent nation-state of Albanians.\n\nThe group of Western scholars he belonged to played a significant role in the creation and dissemination of the myths of Albanian nationalism, \"i.e.\", the myth of a connection of Ali Pasha with the Islamic Bektashi Order, aimed to use Bektashism in creation of the 'Albanian identity' and an 'Albanian state'. Ippen and Nopcsa openly propagated their efforts in financing activities of Albanian nationalists, for example the translation and distribution of the works authored by Sami Frasheri.\n\nIn period between 1897 and 1903 he was a consul of Austria-Hungary in Scutari, then in the Ottoman Empire. In October 1897 Ippen traveled to central Albania and established contacts with important beys in Elbassan and Tirana. Ippen had extensively visited the Catholic clans on the Ottoman-Montenegrin border and reported their problems caused by the Ottoman and Montenegrin authorities. To improve their conditions he asked for provisions of assistance, which were granted as from 1898 to 1903 corn was regularly distributed to the clans, which in turn became pro-Austrian. Ippen distributed money to Albanian families, especially to Albanians from Hoti and Grudë clans who were populated near Montenegrin border and most exposed to Montenegrin influence.\n\nIt was Ippen who asserted that Skanderbeg was buried within the fortifications of Lezhë. His opinion was based on the work of Barletius who wrote that Skanderbeg was buried in the Church of St. Nicholas, without explanation if the church's building was inside or outside the castle. Ippen assumed that such notable person like Skanderbeg would have been buried in the best place of the city, in its castle. He also speculated that the Ottomans transformed this church into a mosque. According to Ippen's estimations around 20,000 Albanians fled parts of Ottoman Empire captured by Serbia during Serbian-Ottoman War (1877-1878).\n\nIppen was one of the authors whose texts were published in the periodical \"Albania\" published by Faik Konitza in period 1897—1910. Konitza assured Ippen that he and his friends believed that Albania should be in political and military union with Austria.\n\n\nPublished in 'Glasnik Zemaljskog muzeja u Bosni i Hercegovini', within series 'Zbirka povjesti' by \"Zemaljska štamparija\" [State's printing house] in Sarajevo, Austria-Hungary:\n\nPublished in 'Die Kultur', Vienna, Austria-Hungary:\n\n\n"}
