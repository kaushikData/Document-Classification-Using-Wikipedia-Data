Although it has been out of print since 2002, the book remains a talking point amongst older travellers. Its unique feature was that practical information was displayed in a set of schematic 'treasure maps' rather than in run-on text, a style later replicated in certain other books by Trailblazer.\n\nBetween maps, the book's writing offered a way to inspire questions and investigation more than providing answers in the style of more classic Lonely Planet style guides. The guide gained a certain notoriety by explaining 'tricks' for crossing ex-Soviet borders semi-legally, for reaching Iraqi Kurdistan when that area was still little known to exist, and for getting into North Korea without a visa. Today these tips appear extremely foolhardy but at the time the book was written (largely pre-Internet) they worked and caused much excitement amongst travellers of the era. Despite considerable interest from the public, there has been no follow-up edition and at times second-hand copies of the original edition have been offered at relatively exorbitant prices on Amazon and e-Bay.\n\nThe book contains several hidden in-jokes including 'towns' on maps named after friends of the authors (Bakus, Danigrad etc.).\n\n\"Asia Overland\" was the first practical guide book in English to cover the ex-Soviet Caucasus region after the breakup of the USSR.\n\n"}
{"id": "1287285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1287285", "title": "Bell Witch", "text": "Bell Witch\n\nThe Bell Witch or Bell Witch Haunting is a legend from Southern American folklore, centered on the 19th-century Bell family of northwest Robertson County, Tennessee. John Bell Sr., who made his living as a farmer, resided with his family along the Red River in an area currently near the town of Adams. According to legend, from 1817-1821, his family and the local area came under attack by a mostly invisible entity that was able to speak, affect the physical environment, and shapeshift. Some accounts record the spirit also to have been clairvoyant and capable of crossing long distances with superhuman speed (and/or of being in more than one place at a time).\n\nIn 1894, newspaper editor Martin V. Ingram published his \"Authenticated History of the Bell Witch\". The book is widely regarded as the first full-length record of the legend and a primary source for subsequent treatments. The individuals recorded in the work were known historical personalities. In modern times, some skeptics have regarded Ingram's efforts as a work of historical fiction or fraud. Other researchers consider Ingram's work a nascent folklore study and an accurate reflection of belief in the region during the 19th century.\n\nWhile not a fundamental element of the original recorded legend, the Bell Witch Cave in the 20th century became a source of continuing interest, belief, and generation of lore. Contemporary artistic interpretations such as in film and music have expanded the reach of the legend beyond the regional confines of the Southern United States.\n\nIn his book \"An Authenticated History of the Bell Witch\", author Martin Van Buren Ingram published that the poltergeist's name was Kate, after the entity claimed at one point to be \"Old Kate Batts' witch,\" and continued to respond favorably to the name. The physical activity centered on the Bells' youngest daughter, Betsy, and her father, and 'Kate' expressed particular displeasure when Betsy became engaged to a local named Joshua Gardner.\n\nThe haunting began sometime in 1817 when John Bell witnessed the apparition of a strange creature resembling a dog. Bell fired at the animal but it disappeared. John's son Drew Bell approached an unknown bird perched on a fence that flew off and was of \"extraordinary size.\" The daughter Betsy observed a girl in green dress swinging from the limb of an oak tree. Dean, a slave of the Bell family, reported being followed by a large black dog on evenings he visited his wife. Activity moved to the Bell household with knocking heard along the door and walls. The family heard sounds of gnawing on the beds, invisible dogs fighting, and chains along the floor. About this time John Bell began experiencing paralysis in his mouth. The phenomena grew in intensity as sheets were pulled from beds when the children slept. Soon the entity pulled hair and scratched the children with particular emphasis on Betsy who was slapped, pinched and stuck with pins.\n\nThe Bells turned to a family friend James Johnston for help. After retiring for the evening at the Bell home, Johnston was awakened that night by the same phenomena. That morning he told John Bell it was a \"spirit, just like in the Bible.\" Soon word of the haunting spread with some traveling great distances to see the witch. The apparition began to speak out loud and was asked, \"Who are you and what do you want?\" and the voice answered feebly, \"I am a spirit; I was once very happy but have been disturbed.\" The spirit offered diverse explanations of why it had appeared, tying its origin to the disturbance of a Native American burial mound located on the property, and sent Drew Bell and Bennett Porter on a unproductive search for buried treasure. With the emergence of full conversations, the spirit repeated word for word two sermons given 13 miles apart at the same time. The entity was well acquainted with Biblical text and appeared to enjoy religious arguments. As another amusement, the witch shared gossip about activities in other households, and at times appeared to leave for brief moments to visit homes after an inquiry.\n\nJohn Johnston, a son of James, devised a test for the witch, something no one outside his family would know, asking the entity what his Dutch step-grandmother in North Carolina would say to the slaves if she thought they did something wrong. The witch replied with his grandmother's accent, \"Hut tut, what has happened now?\" In another account, an Englishman stopped to visit and offered to investigate. On remarking on his family overseas, the witch suddenly began to mimic his English parents. Again at early morning, the witch woke him to voices of his parents worried as they had heard his voice as well. The Englishman quickly left that morning and later wrote to the Bell family that the entity had visited his family in England. He apologized for his skepticism.\n\nAt times, the spirit displayed a form of kindness, especially towards Lucy, John Bell's wife, \"the most perfect woman to walk to earth.\" The witch would give Lucy fresh fruit and sing hymns to her, and showed John Bell Jr. a measure of respect.\n\nReferring to John Bell Sr. as \"Old Jack,\" the witch claimed she intended to kill him and signaled this intention through curses, threats and afflictions. The story climaxes with the Bell patriarch being poisoned by the witch. Afterward the entity interrupted the mourners by singing drinking songs. In 1821, as a result of the witch's entreatment, Betsy Bell called off her engagement to Joshua Gardner. Subsequently, the entity told the family it was going to leave, but return in seven years in 1828. The witch returned on time to Lucy and her sons Richard and Joel with similar activities as before, but they chose not to encourage it, and the witch appeared to leave again.\n\nSeveral accounts say that during his military career, Andrew Jackson was intrigued with the story and his men were frightened away after traveling to investigate. In an independent oral tradition recorded in the vicinity of Panola County, Mississippi, the witch was the ghost of an unpleasant overseer John Bell murdered in North Carolina. In this tradition, the spirit falls in love with the central character 'Mary', leading to her death. This account is reminiscent of vampire lore. The supernatural powers attributed to the Tennessee spirit have also been compared to that of jinn in mythology.\n\nIn the manuscript attributed to Richard Williams Bell, he wrote that the spirit remained a mystery:\n\nThe publications \"New England Farmer\" of Boston and the \"Green Mountain Freeman\" of Vermont in January and February 1856 published an article regarding the Bell Witch legend and the publications ascribed the origin of the text to the \"Saturday Evening Post\". The \"Farmer\" was a weekly agricultural journal. The \"Freeman\" was affiliated with the abolitionist Liberty Party. The unidentified author described the apparition as the 'Tennessee Ghost' or 'Bell Ghost,' and stated the event occurred 30 years or more from the time the article was written. There are three human characters in the account, Mr. Bell, his daughter Betsey Bell, and Joshua Gardner. The author stated that the voice, which spoke freely about the house from all directions, would not manifest itself until the lights were extinguished at night. The phenomenon attracted wide interest. The author claimed to have become well acquainted with Mr. Gardner. When the ghost was asked how long it would remain, it replied, \"until Joshua Gardner and Betsey Bell get married.\" The author goes on to state that Betsey Bell had fallen in love with Joshua Gardner and had discovered the skill of 'ventriloquism'. The author states that Ms. Bell then used her skill to attempt to convince Joshua Gardner to marry her. When they did not marry, the apparition disappeared.\n\nM. V. Ingram, in his \"An Authenticated History Of The Bell Witch\", wrote that a \"Saturday Evening Post\" article regarding the Bell Witch had been retracted:\n\nIn September 1868, an article was published entitled \"Witchcraft and Murder: Hobgoblins and Old Gray Horses the Incentive to Crime.\" Tom Clinard and Dick Burgess were arrested for the murder of Mr. Smith. The article reported that Smith claimed the powers of witchcraft while working near Adam's Station, chopping wood on a farm with the defendants. The article stated that Smith claimed to use these occult powers on Clinard and Burgess, leading to the conflict between them. The identity of the decedent was reported variously as James or Charles Smith. The jury of State vs. Clinard and Burgess returned a not guilty verdict.\n\nIngram published an interview with Lucinda E. Rawls, of Clarksville, Tennessee, daughter of Alexander Gooch and Theny Thorn, both reported as close friends of Betsy Bell. Rawls testified that the Bell Witch was a frequent topic of conversation during her lifetime and pointed to a murder of a man for witchcraft as evidence for this claim.\n\nIngram appended a date of 1875 or 1876 to the bloodshed, but connected the Rawls recollection with the death of Smith:\n\nOn April 24, 1880 an article was published regarding a 'haunted house' in Springfield, Tennessee where knocking underneath the floor was heard. The fourth night of knockings began at 10:30 p.m. and ended at 4 a.m. with the home surrounded by 10-12 persons working in an effort to discover the origin of the sound. In a follow up report from April 26, 1880, the writer reported that several hundred people had visited the home attempting to witness the phenomenon with many camped out over night despite the home owners asking them to leave. On Wednesday night, April 28, 1880, the family were reported to have left the home for the night and a smaller group of investigators around the home heard knocking from fifty yards away. During the events, the journalist took the opportunity to mention the Bell Witch legend:\n\nIt is an actual fact that several hundred intelligent people of Springfield and vicinity have been so excited over the noise as to go night after night to listen to it ... About thirty years ago Robertson county had a sensation similar to this known as the \"Bell Witch,\" and people came from all parts of the country, even as far as New York, to hear or see her.\n\nThe Springfield floor knocking occurred at the residence of John W. Nuckolls, a prominent physician. Nuckolls was recently married to Laura Hopkins Jones, a union opposed by her family. The phenomenon created a domestic disturbance between the couple, as a local carpenter, Gill Walling, accused Laura Nuckolls of creating the noise with an iron ball attached to a rubber belt hidden under her clothes. Robertson County historian Yolanda Reid states, \"they came to the conclusion that the wife was tying it into the bottom of her skirt to make the sounds, nobody ever proved it.\" The couple separated in May, 1880. That August, John Nuckolls retrieved his infant child from his wife, running through town with his estranged wife following in anguish. Afterward the child was returned to Laura Nuckolls who was living with her father, Asa Hopkins. John Nuckolls, in February 1882, confronted Laura's father, over his desire to see the child, and threatened his father-in-law's life. During the argument, the subject of 'ghosts' between the men was reported by an eyewitness as Nuckolls attempted to shoot Hopkins but was restrained. The next day, as a result of this confrontation, Nuckoll's brother-in-law, S. B. Hopkins, traveled from Nashville and shot John W. Nuckolls with a double-barreled shotgun, causing his death. The circumstances of the shooting were contested and S. B. Hopkins was acquitted of murder.\n\nThe journal \"Studies in Philology\", in 1919, published a study of witchcraft in North Carolina by folklorist Tom Peete Cross. Cross cites a column from the \"Nashville Banner\" where it mentions the paper had sent a reporter to Robertson County in the 1880s, John C. Cooke, to investigate reports of the possible reemergence of the Bell Witch phenomenon.\n\nA several page account of the Bell Witch legend was included in a sketch of Robertson County and was reportedly written for Nashville's Centennial Exposition in 1880. The sketch was published in 1900 by the Tennessee Historical Society. The author of the sketch is unknown and the article is undated. Dates in the sketch end at 1880. The writer stated the source of the first portion of the narrative from \"F. R. Miles, William Pride, W. J. Gooch, Ben. B. Batts, and many others.\" The author identified the burial disturbance as skull bones previously located in a \"mound nearby on the river bluff.\" The return of the remains did not placate the spirit. The witch could speak in several languages and would \"set the dogs\" on unsuspecting victims. In the Centennial account, the Bell entity did not explicitly poison John Bell.\n\nAt one time a vial of poison was found in the flue of the chimney, and being taken down, Dr. George B. Hopson gave one drop to a cat, causing its death in seven seconds. The witch claimed to have put the poison there for the purpose of killing Mr. Bell. Being asked how it was going to administer the poison, it said by pouring it into the dinner pot. It is remarkable that, although he enjoyed good health up to the time of this event, Mr. Bell died within [ ] days after the vial was found, being in a stupor at the time of his death. From this time the people visited the house less frequently, although the witch would now and then be heard.\n\nIn the Ingram account, attributed to Richard Williams Bell, John Bell was already suffering from an unknown affliction and bedridden for some time. John Bell's son, John Bell Jr., found the vial in the cupboard after his father did not wake. The family called for Dr. Hopson, while the Bell Witch exclaimed she had fed the poison to John Bell. Alex Gunn and John Bell Jr. tested the poison on the cat with a straw, which \"died very quick.\" John Bell died the next day on December 20, 1820.\n\nThe Centennial sketch stated the witch could appear as a rabbit, bear or black dog, and imitate various animal sounds. The sketch described the entity as one of seven spirits with three names given by the author: Three Waters, Tynaperty, and Black Dog. The Ingram account also described a family of spirits. In addition to Kate, the other members of the 'witch family' had the names of Blackdog, Mathematics, Cypocryphy, and Jerusalem. Blackdog was described as the apparent leader of the group.\n\nGoodspeed Brothers' 1886 \"History of Tennessee\", recorded a short account of the legend that identified the spirit as female and stated that interest in the phenomenon was widespread in the region at the time.\n\nA remarkable occurrence, which attracted wide-spread interest, was connected with the family of John Bell, who settled near what is now Adams Station about 1804. So great was the excitement that people came from hundreds of miles around to witness the manifestations of what was popularly known as the \"Bell Witch.\" This witch was supposed to be some spiritual being having the voice and attributes of a woman. It was invisible to the eye, yet it would hold conversation and even shake hands with certain individuals. The freaks it performed were wonderful, and seemingly designed to annoy the family. It would take the sugar from the bowls, spill the milk, take the quilts from the beds, slap and pinch the children, and then laugh at the discomfiture of its victims. At first it was supposed to be a good spirit, but its subsequent acts, together with the curses with which it supplemented its remarks, proved the contrary. A volume might be written concerning the performances of this wonderful being, as they are now described by contemporaries and their descendants. That all this actually occurred will not be disputed, nor will a rational explanation be attempted. It is merely introduced as an example of superstition, strong in the minds of all but a few in those times, and not yet wholly extinct.\n\nAn article was published February 3, 1890 describing a series of events from Adam's Station, Tennessee. At dusk, January 27, 1890, Mr. Hollaway reported watching two unknown women arrive at his home and dismount from their horses as he was feeding cattle. When he arrived at the house, the horses and women were gone. Mr. Hollaway's wife reported seeing the women in the yard as well. That week, Mr. Rowland attempted to place a sack of corn on his horse's back and it fell off. He again attempted to place the sack of corn on the horse's back several more times, but each time the sack fell off. Joe Johnson arrived and held on to the sack as Mr. Rowland mounted his horse. They witnessed the sack floating away for 20 yards where it settled down at the fence. When the men went to retrieve the sack, a voice was heard, \"You won't touch this sack anymore.\"\n\nA follow up report was published on February 18, 1890 with the title, \"A Weird Witch: More Tales of a Mulhattanish Flavor from Adams Station.\" In the late 19th century, Joseph Mulhattan was a known hoaxer of newspaper articles. The article was republished a few days later with the subtitle \"More Tales of a Fishy Flavor.\" In the account, the entity was referred to only as the witch. The article reports that Mr. Johnson was visiting Buck Smith and were discussing a recent visitation of the ghost at his home. They heard a knocking at the door, and when they opened the door, the knocking began at another door. They sat down and the dog began to fight with something invisible. Two minutes later, the door flew open and fire spread across the room blown by a cyclonic wind with the coals disappearing as they tried to put it out. That evening Mr. Johnson started home on his horse and something jumped on the back grabbing his shoulder as he tried to restrain the horse. He felt it jump off as he neared his home and move in the leaves into the woods.\n\nMr. Winters reported taking a peculiar bird while hunting with great difficulty. After he returned home, he opened the game-bag to discover the bird had disappeared and in place was a rabbit which then also disappeared. While burning vegetation outdoors, Mr. Rowland described a visit at 9 p.m. of a half clothed black man with one eye in his forehead that directed Mr. Rowland to follow him and dig at a large rock. The figure then disappeared. Mr. Rowland dug that night until exhaustion. He received help the next morning from Bill Burgess and Mr. Johnson and discovered something described as a \"kettle turned bottom upward.\" They were unable to remove it as the soil began moving back into the hole faster than the men could remove the soil. The report concludes saying that many people were visiting to see the witch.\n\nBorn near Guthrie, Kentucky, June 20, 1832, Martin Van Buren Ingram took over responsibility of the family farm at the age of 17. A member of Hawkins' Nashville Battalion during the Civil War, he was discharged for disability after the Battle of Shiloh. Ingram began his editing and publishing career in April 1866 with the \"Robertson Register\" with no previous experience. October 1868, Ingram moved the paper to Clarksville and began issuing the \"Clarksville Tobacco Leaf\" in February 1869. Ingram continued an ownership association with the \"Leaf\" until about 1881. The consequences of poor health, family tragedy and fire limited his continuing interest in the newspaper industry.\n\nOn the occasion of Ingram's death in October 1909, editor of the \"Clarksville Leaf Chronicle\", W. W. Barksdale, wrote of his friend and colleague:\n\nThe week of January 24, 1890, Ingram was suffering from a \"severe case of la grippe.\" February, 1890 Ingram resigned as editor of the \"Clarksville Chronicle\". A month later, the \"Chronicle\" was purchased by the \"Leaf\", and Ingram joined the new editorial staff. On July 13, 1892, a report in the \"Leaf-Chronicle\" was published of Ingram's travels to Adams Station and Cedar Hill with John Allen Gunn, \"for the purpose of viewing the grounds where historic and most intensely thrilling events were enacted seventy-five years ago,\" and interviewing individuals, who \"were then living and familiar with the wonderful phenomena that awakened such a widespread sensation.\" In the report, Mahala Darden, age 85, related memory of Lafayette's visit to Clarksville in 1825. A follow up report was published July 19, 1892, recording a visit to Nancy Ayers, daughter of John Johnston. Ingram left the editorial position with the \"Leaf-Chronicle\" the same month.\n\nIngram subsequently traveled to Chicago in October 1893, while editor of the \"Progress-Democrat\", in an attempt to publish his manuscript, \"An Authenticated History of the Famous Bell Witch. The Wonder of the 19th Century, and Unexplained Phenomenon of the Christian Era. The Mysterious Talking Goblin that Terrorized the West End of Robertson County, Tennessee, Tormenting John Bell to His Death. The Story of Betsy Bell, Her Lover and the Haunting Sphinx.\" Ingram left the \"Progress-Democrat\" to complete his book in February 1894. At the end of March, it was announced publisher W. P. Titus of Clarksville would print the work. The publisher reported a delay in printing after the witch visited one night in early May. Titus stated the witch demonstrated with maniacal singing, laughter, prayers, moaning, clapping, and rattling of the roof. The phenomena caused the printers to evacuate. By July 1894, the book was in print and a review from the newspaper in Hopkinsville presented the work as a factual account.\n\nIn the introduction to the book, Ingram published a letter dated July 1, 1891 from former TN State Representative James Allen Bell of Adairville, Kentucky. J. A. Bell, a son of Richard Williams Bell and a grandson of John Bell Sr., explained that his father had met with his brother John Bell Jr. before his death and they agreed no material he had collected should be released until the last immediate family member of John Bell Sr. had died. The last immediate member of the family and youngest child of John Bell Sr., Joel Egbert Bell died in 1890 at the age of 77.\n\nJ. Allen Bell expressed the belief that his father's manuscript was written when he was 35 years old in 1846. He stated his father gave him the manuscript and family notes shortly before his death in 1857. Richard Williams Bell was roughly 6 to 10 years of age during the initial manifestations of the Bell Witch phenomenon and 17 at the occurrence of the spirit's return in 1828. The reported contributions of Richard Williams Bell, approximately 90 pages in length, are recorded in Chapter 8 of Ingram's work, entitled \"Our Family Trouble\".\n\nAccording to Brian Dunning no one has ever seen this diary, and there is no evidence that it ever existed: \"Conveniently, every person with firsthand knowledge of the Bell Witch hauntings was already dead when Ingram started his book; in fact, every person with secondhand knowledge was even dead.\" Dunning also concluded that Ingram was guilty of falsifying another statement, that the \"Saturday Evening Post\" had published a story in 1849 accusing the Bells' daughter Elizabeth of creating the witch, an article which was not found at the time. Joe Nickell argues the chapter includes the use of Masonic themes and anachronism which impacts credibility. Jim Brooks, native of Adams, writes in his work \"Bell Witch Stories You Never Heard,\" that Bell family descendants report that Ingram did not return the manuscript to the family. Brooks explores the possibility that Ingram would have had an enhanced opportunity to modify the story by not returning the papers.\n\nKeith Cartwright of the University of North Florida compares Ingram's work with \"Uncle Remus\" folklore as recorded by Joel Chandler Harris and also as an expression of the psychological shame of slavery and Native American removal. The slaves in the account are regarded as experts on the witch, with Uncle Zeke identifying the witch as, \"dat Injun spirit ... the Injuns was here fust, and we white fokes driv em out, all but dem whar wur dead and cudent go, an da's here yit, in der spirit.\" The figure of \"progress\" Gen. Andrew Jackson was brought nearly to heel and the master, John Bell, was dead. The role of the trickster not played by the Br'er Rabbit but the witch-rabbit, the spirit's common animal form. The displaced, blacks, widows and girls, act as witness to a force polite society cannot comprehend. The witch, \"appears as a catch-all for every remainder of resistant agency.\"\n\nAmong those who were alive during the haunting, Ingram conducted interviews with Ibby Gunn, born in 1806, a daughter of Uncle Zeke and the sister-in-law of Dean, as well as Mahala Byrns Darden, born circa 1807, daughter of James Byrns. Ibby Gunn shared some experiences of Dean including the creation of a witch ball made of hair by her sister Kate for her husband Dean, the use of which appeared to anger the entity. Mahala Darden detailed what she understood family and friends were experiencing at the time of the haunting, expressed her great fear the witch would come visit her home and also related the spirit sang drinking songs at John Bell's graveside.\n\nThe account of General Andrew Jackson's visit is confined to Chapter 11 of Ingram's work. The chapter is a letter from Thomas L. Yancey, an attorney in Clarksville, dated January 1894. Yancey explained that his grandfather, Whitmel Fort, was a witness to phenomena at the Bell homestead and Fort had related the story of Jackson's visit which was undated in the letter. Yancey described his grandfather's account as, \"quite amusing to me.\"\n\nThe Bell household was strained of resources from visitors and Jackson brought a wagon load of supplies with his men. Nearing the Bell homestead, the wagon stopped and appeared fastened to its position despite considerable effort by Jackson's men to free it. Jackson exclaimed, \"By the eternal, boys, it is the witch.\" A metallic voice was heard in the vegetation, \"All right General, let the wagon move on, I will see you again tonight.\" The horses began moving again. Instead of camping out, the party stayed at the Bell home that evening. Among the Jackson party was a 'witch layer' who boasted of his supernatural exploits. Tiring of the bravado, Jackson whispered, \"By the eternals, I do wish the thing would come, I want to see him run.\" The entity arrived and taunted the witch layer to shoot her. The man's gun would not fire. The witch countered, \"I'll teach you a lesson,\" and appeared to beat the man and led him out the door by his nose. Jackson exclaimed, \"By the eternal, boys, I never saw so much fun in all my life. This beats fighting the British.\" The witch told Jackson she would uncover another rascal the next night. That morning Jackson's men chose to leave for home as they were apprehensive as to who was next.\n\nParanormal investigator Benjamin Radford, as well as Brian Dunning, conclude that there is no evidence that Andrew Jackson visited the Bell family home. During the years in question, Jackson's movements were well documented, and nowhere in history or his writings is there evidence of his knowledge of the Bell family. According to Dunning, \"The 1824 Presidential election was notoriously malicious, and it seems hard to believe that his opponent would have overlooked the opportunity to drag him through the mud for having lost a fight to a witch.\" Carl Lindahl, affiliated with the University of Houston, writes that the Andrew Jackson encounter is an example of how belief and history mix together in the formation of legend. Such legends, which may persist in a locale for generations, upon receiving a media treatment can spread far outside of the area where the legend originated.\n\nA prophecy was reported by May 1903 that the witch could return on the centennial of the Bell family arrival in Tennessee. In response to an August 1903 article from Memphis, \"The Springfield Herald\" expressed that no one in the local area was concerned with a return of the Bell Witch and made a charge of plagiarism towards the Memphis paper. The \"Herald\" also stated the copyright for Ingram's work had passed to his son Tolbert who was working at The Denver Times. By September, the local paper was again incredulous as the spirit was not reported to have returned in August.\n\nCharles Bailey Bell, a grandson of John Bell Jr., and neurologist in Nashville, published a book entitled \"The Bell Witch: A Mysterious Spirit\" in 1934. In the work, he recounted stories he stated were told to him by his great aunt Betsy later in her life. This included another account of Andrew Jackson's visit and of a boy trapped in the Bell Witch Cave and pulled out of the cave feet first by the witch. Bell also detailed a series of prophecies he stated were given to his ancestors in 1828 by the spirit, including a declaration the witch was set to return again in 1935, 107 years after her last visit to the Bell family.\n\nIn 1937, there were reports of quirky events. Louis Garrison, owner of the farm that included the Bell Witch Cave, heard unexplained noises coming from inside. Bell descendants described the sound of something rubbing against a house, a paper like object that flew out the door and reentered through a side door, and faint music heard from a piano. A group from the local Epworth League were reported to have attended a wiener roast in a rock quarry near the Bell Witch Cave on July 29, 1937. The group were joking about the legend when they saw a figure of a woman sitting on top of the cliff over the cave causing many to flee. According to the newspaper, a minister in the group later claimed to have investigated and discovered it was moonlight on a rock. The second report concluded with a weather report that the moon was barely noticeable that night. Jim Brooks published in 2015 that his mother was in attendance at the roast, and relates that the minister caught up to the youth on the road to town after discovering no explanation for the figure.\n\nIn November 1965, an article was published involving an antique oak rocking chair said to have been previously owned by attorney Charlie Willett, a Bell descendant. The rocking chair was acquired in Willett's estate sale by Mrs. J. C. Adams, owner of an antique store on U.S. 41. A customer sat down in the chair, after learning it was not for sale, and while rocking in the chair asked Mrs. Adams if she believed in the supernatural. Two weeks later, the customer's daughter visited the home of Mrs. Adams and said after her mother had left and visited the Bell cemetery a voice told her to \"stand up and look around, you will find something of much value.\" After some car trouble, the woman walked out into a field and found a black iron kettle turned over. She turned the kettle over and found a pearl buckle in the grass. The woman's daughter reported a jeweler estimated the buckle to be 160 to 200 years old.\n\nAttorney Charles Romaine Willett (1886-1963), son of Sarah Elizabeth Bell, began an interest in the newspaper business at the age of 16. After some time playing professional baseball and working at other newspapers, Willett became the first managing editor of the \"Nashville Tennessean\" in 1907 while teaching himself law. A mayor of Adams, and member of the State legislature, Charlie Willett was known for his reliability. Every Sunday, Willett would accompany his sweetheart, Miss Jerry Cullom Gardner, for ice cream in Clarksville and dinner at Richardson's Restaurant on the return home. According to community lore, the couple never married so as not to tempt fate as they descended from the Bell and Gardner families respectively. Jim Brooks relates that a family member detailed familial obligations as the likely explanation. Brooks inquired what the couple thought about the rumor in the early 1960s. Jerry Gardner explained if Charlie Willet ever asked her to marry him, she would assent. When Brooks related this to Charlie Willett, he immediately smiled, pulled his thumbs through his suspenders and said, \"Oh, she said that, did she?\"\n\nBonnie Haneline, in 1977, recounted a time during her childhood in 1944 when she was exploring the cave. She left English class, playing 'hooky,' and borrowed a lantern from Mrs. Garrison, the cave owner. She reported to have explored the cave with her friends for several years. While she was inside, her lantern blew out despite no breeze inside the cave. She managed to relight the lantern and it blew out again. Terrified, she crawled along the water path of the cave in the dark until she reached the entrance where she saw an opened can of pork and beans and marshmallows. Later that evening, she learned law enforcement discovered two escaped fugitives in the back of the cave. She credited the witch with helping her avoid them.\n\nA visit in 1977 was reported of five soldiers from nearby Fort Campbell to the Bell Witch Cave. One of the soldiers was sitting on a rock and expressed skepticism of the legend when something invisible grabbed him around the chest.\n\nIn 1986, staff writer David Jarrard for \"The Tennessean\" and photographer Bill Wilson, the latter also a member of the National Speleological Society, were given permission to sleep in the cave over night. While in the first cave room they heard a noise from deeper in the cave Jarrard estimated at 30 yards. Subsequently, an \"unwavering groan\" repeated again with greater volume and accompanied by several loud thumps. When it began a third time, the men retreated to the gate entrance. They explored the wiring to the lights looking for a reason for the noises. They went back to the first cave room but heard a rumble near the entrance. Walking back to the entrance they discovered the rumble was noise from a jet. As they reached the gate, a loud, high pitched scream emanated from inside the cave. The journalists left and did not spend the night.\n\nIn 1987, H. C. Sanders, owner of a nearby gas station, reported 20 years earlier he ran out of gas at night near the Red River across from the Bell Witch Cave. He began to walk towards town when a rabbit came out of the woods and began to follow him. Sanders walked faster, but the rabbit kept pace even as he broke out into a run. After a mile, Sanders sat down on a log to catch his breath. The rabbit hopped up on the other side of the log looked at him and said, \"Hell of a race we had there, wasn't it?\"\n\nAccording to Radford, the Bell Witch story is an important one for all paranormal researchers: \"It shows how easily legend and myth can be mistaken for fact and real events and how easily the lines are blurred\" when sources are not checked. Dunning wrote that there was no need to discuss the supposed paranormal activity until there was evidence that the story was true. \"Vague stories indicate that there was a witch in the area. All the significant facts of the story have been falsified, and the others come from a source of dubious credibility. Since no reliable documentation of any actual events exists, there is nothing worth looking into.\"\n\nDunning concludes, \"I chalk up the Bell Witch as nothing more than one of many unsubstantiated folk legends, vastly embellished and popularized by an opportunistic author of historical fiction.\" Radford reminds readers that \"the burden of proof is not on skeptics to \"disprove\" anything but rather for the proponents to prove ... claims\".\n\nJoe Nickell has written that many of those who knew Betsy suspected her of fraud and the Bell Witch story \"sounds suspiciously like an example of \"the poltergeist-faking syndrome\" in which someone, typically a child, causes the mischief.\"\n\nAmy Fluker, a researcher of the Mississippi version of the legend while affiliated with the University of Mississippi, has expressed the Bell Witch legend has other value. \"As a historian of collective memory, it matters very little to my research if hauntings are real or not. It does matter that people believe they are. As a result, they can help us understand the perspectives, in this case, of 19th and 20th century Americans.\"\n\nThere have been several movies based, at least in part, on the Bell Witch legend. Roger Clarke, former film critic for \"The Independent\", argues the legend has also had a measurable influence on cinema such as in the \"Poltergeist\" film series, the found footage \"Paranormal Activity\" film series, \"The Witch\" released in 2015, the trope of burial ground disturbance in \"The Amityville Horror\", and the apport of cherries to the children in \"Mama\" released in 2013.\n\nThe American television series \"Ghost Adventures\" filmed an episode at the Bell Witch Cave.\n\nAn American television series – \"Cursed: The Bell Witch\" – based on descendants of the Bell family trying to end the curse. The series premiered October 2015 on the A&E Network.\n\nThe Travel Channel series Haunted Live featured the paranormal investigators the Tennessee Wraith Chasers visit the town of Adams, Tenn. where the descendants of the Bell family take them to the cabin.\n\nCharles Faulkner Bryan, as apart of a Guggenheim Fellowship, composed \"The Bell Witch,\" a cantata which premiered in Carnegie Hall in 1947 with Robert Shaw conducting the Juilliard Chorus and Orchestra.\n\nNashville music group The Shakers released \"Living In The Shadow Of A Spirit\" in 1988 on vinyl record EP.\n\nAnn Marie DeAngelo and Conni Ellisor choreographed and composed a ballet entitled \"The Bell Witch\" for the Nashville Ballet.\n\nNashville Children's Theatre premiered \"Our Family Trouble: The Legend of the Bell Witch\" in 1976. The play was written by Audrey Campbell.\n\nA play by Ric White, \"The Bell Witch Story\". First performed in 1998 by the Sumner County Players. And performed again in 2008 by the Tennessee Theater Company.\n\nA play by David Alford, \"Spirit: The Authentic Story of the Bell Witch of Tennessee\", performed in Adams, TN during the Bell Witch Fall Festival in late October.\n\nThe Danish metal band Mercyful Fate released a song titled \"The Bell Witch\" on their 1993 album \"In the Shadows\".\n\nSeattle-based doom metal band Bell Witch took their name from this legend.\n\nMerle Kilgore recorded a song titled \"The Bell Witch\" in 1964.\n\nMadeline recorded a song titled \"The Legend of the Bell Witch\" in 2014.\n\n\n\n"}

Deeper learning is based on the premise that the nature of work, civic, and everyday life is changing and therefore increasingly requires that formal education provides young people with mastery of skills like analytic reasoning, complex problem solving, and teamwork. \n\nDeeper learning is associated with a growing movement in U.S. education that places special emphasis on the ability to apply knowledge to real-world circumstances and to solve novel problems. \n\n\"Deeper learning\" was first introduced by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation in 2010 and specified a set of educational outcomes-\n\nA number of U.S. schools and school districts serving a broad socio-economic spectrum apply deeper learning as an integral component of their instructional approach.\n\nWhile the term \"deeper learning\" is relatively new, the notion of enabling students to develop skills that empower them to apply learning and to adapt to and thrive in post-secondary education as well as career and life is not. A number of significant antecedents to deeper learning exist.\n\nFor example, American philosopher, psychologist and educational reformer John Dewey (1859–1952) made a strong case for the importance of education not only as a place to gain content knowledge, but also as a place to learn how to live. Like modern proponents of deeper learning, Dewey believed that students thrive in an environment where they are allowed to experience and interact with the curriculum, and all students should have the opportunity to take part in their own learning. Dewey's arguments undergirded the movements of progressive education and constructivist education, which called for teaching and learning beyond rote content knowledge.\n\nIn the 1990s, skills-based education saw a resurgence with the advent of the \"21st Century Skills\" movements and the \"Partnership for 21st Century skills\". In 2012 the National Research Council of the National Academies issued \"Education for Life and Work: Developing Transferrable Knowledge and Skill in the 21st Century,\" a report on deeper learning re-elevating the issue and summarizing research evidence on its outcomes to date. These were followed by a multi-collection series of major voices (e.g. Ken Kay, Linda Darling Hammond, Yong Zhao, James Pellegrino and others) in the Leading Edge publications \"Rethinking Student Learning\" and \"Deeper Learning: Beyond 21st Century Skills\". In addition, Solution Tree published \"How to Teach Thinking in the Common Core\" and \"Enriched Learning Projects\" by James Bellanca. Teacher College Press also published \"how to\" books to help teachers with deeper learning instruction. Included in these are Reuven Feuerstein's \"Beyond Smarter\" and James Bellanca's \"Focus Factor\" and \"Classrooms without Borders\".\n\nAccording to labor economists Frank Levy of MIT and Richard Murnane of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education, since 1970, with the economic changes brought about by technology and globalization, employers’ demands for workers with routine, repetitive skills—whether manual or cognitive—have dropped steeply, while demand for those with deeper learning competencies like complex thinking and communications skills has soared.\n\nLevy and Murnane argue that the success of the U.S. economy will rely on the nation’s ability to give students the \"foundational skills in problem-solving and communications that computers don’t have.\"\n\nResearch by Cassel and Kolstad found that by the year 2000 the top skills demanded by U.S. Fortune 500 companies had shifted from traditional reading, writing and arithmetic to teamwork, problem solving, and interpersonal skills.\n\nA 2006 Conference Board survey of some 400 employers revealed that key deeper learning competencies were the most important for new entrants into the workforce. Essential capabilities included oral and written communications and critical thinking/problem solving. The Conference Board findings indicate that \"applied skills on all educational levels trump basic knowledge and skills, such as Reading Comprehension and Mathematics ... while the ‘three Rs’ are still fundamental to any new workforce entrant’s ability to do the job, employers emphasize that applied skills like Teamwork/Collaboration and Critical Thinking are ‘very important’ to success at work.\"\n\nIn 2002 a coalition of national business community, education leaders, and policymakers founded the Partnership for 21st Century Skills (now the Partnership for 21st Century Learning, or P21), a non-profit organization. P21's goal is to foster a national conversation on \"the importance of 21st century skills for all students\" and \"position 21st century readiness at the center of US K-12 education\". The organization has released reports exploring how to integrate the Four Cs approach into learning environments. Their research and publications included an identification of deeper learning competencies and skills they called the Four Cs of 21st century learning (collaboration, communication, critical thinking, creativity). In a 2012 survey conducted by the American Management Association (AMA), executives found a need for highly skilled employees to keep up with the fast pace of change in business and to compete on a global level. The survey identified three of the \"Four Cs\" (critical thinking, communication and collaboration) as the top three skills necessary for these employees.\n\nDeeper learning practitioners have developed a number instructional reform methods and built a variety of classroom, school, and district models. While stressing robust content mastery, instructors ask students to \"move beyond basic comprehension and algorithmic procedures and engage in skills that lie at the top of traditional learning taxonomies—analysis, synthesis, and creation,\" according to Harvard education scholars Jal Mehta and Sarah Fine. \"Students are treated as active meaning makers with the capacity to do interesting and valuable work now ... the purpose of school is not so much to prepare students for a hypothetical future as to support them in engaging with the complex challenges that professional work at its best entails.\"\n\nIn its 2012 report \"Education for Life and Work\", the National Research Council identified the following research-based methods for developing deeper learning:\n\nDeeper examination of what \"best practices\" evidence shows connect teaching methods to the development of the Partnership for 21st Century Learning's 4C framework and the competencies identified in the Hewlett model for deeper learning, give a sharper picture of \"what works\" in terms of instructional strategies and tools. For instance, the Marzano Lab has identified the high effects of cooperative learning to develop collaboration, graphic organizers to advance critical thinking, feedback to sharpen communication, advance organizers to enrich entry activities in PBLs, etc. John Hattie's meta-analysis of visible learning is even more specific. Strategies that promote metacognition, reflection, student feedback, creativity, inquiry and more support the type of teaching that most enriches mindful, deeper learning. In addition, his studies detail how surface teaching strategies such as lectures, worksheets, overly frequent testing and others do little for achievement or deeper learning. For young learners, the Center for Childhood Creativity has identified the powerful role of creative thinking in the classroom.\n\nWhile evidence supporting the direct impact of education organized around deeper learning outcomes in driving academic achievement is not robust to date, it continues to build. P21 is leading an effort at the University of Connecticut to remedy this. As early as 2008 a study of seven hundred California students demonstrated that students exposed to math instruction designed to develop deeper learning competencies significantly outperformed peers taught through more traditional methods.\n\nA number of educational reform school networks across the country focus on developing deeper learning competencies. While committed to deeper learning educational outcomes, these networks, however, vary in their instructional models and approaches to school design. They include: Asia Society International Studies Schools Network, Big Picture Learning, ConnectEd California, EdVisions Schools, Envision Education, Expeditionary Learning, High Tech High, Internationals Network for Public Schools, New Tech Network, New Visions for Public Schools. A 2014 trade book by educational consultant Monica Martinez highlights features of Deeper Learning schools.\n\nBecause of limits imposed by state and federal laws, public school districts face the largest challenges to bring deeper learning back into their schools. The Partnership for 21st Century Learning ( initiated the identification of exemplar schools which were relying on inclusion of 21st Century Skills as a base component for bringing deeper learning experiences to all children. Some of these exemplar schools come from the reform networks, but many are schools and districts that targeted deeper learning instruction and outcomes as their mission but without the benefits in money, public relations and compliance given to charter schools.\n\nTo further advance the notion, P21 created a Blogazine to \"connect the dots between 21st Century skills and deeper learning outcomes\". The blog articles are written pro bono by major educational writers who advocate for the paradigm shift to Deeper Learning as well as by a balance of school leaders, teachers, professional learning specialists and others who are incorporating deeper learning practices into their curricula, instruction, assessment and system change plans. In its second year, the no-fee online P21 Blogazine expanded into a three times weekly online journal as a major voice of deeper learning theory and practice. Its aim was to seed understanding of the principles and picture the best practices occurring in innovative schools and classrooms.\n\nIt expanded its distribution by partnering with major 21st Century learning organizations such as Connected Educator's Month, chapters of ASCD, school districts and many P21 sponsors.It introduced a self-directed professional learning option for educators who are interested in reading, discussing and putting action plans garnered from P21 posts into classrooms.\n\nAs more schools, especially public schools, began to plan to integrate deeper learning, a group of Illinois advocates, aligned with P21, searched for assistance to scale best 21st Century teaching practices into classrooms. Already successful exemplars in the US and abroad were relying on versions of project based learning (problem-based, inquiry-based, product-making, project- based); there was great variation in effectiveness. After reviewing models from multiple sources, the Illinois Consortium for 21st Century Schools determined none were adequate for systemic integration into schools or systems. The consortium team, made up of volunteer, long experienced professional developers, classroom teachers, administrators and school change specialists, all with experience in \"public\" school reform, adapted and redesigned the most effective PBL models and designed a new school-wide approach of PBL that included explicit instruction and assessment of the 4CS as advocated by the Partnership, technology, reflection and a 5th C, cultural responsiveness. These elements were integrated into a PBL design cycle, called MindQuest21. Creative making was balanced with critical thinking to allow for teachers to challenge the narrow framework of the standards which ignored the creative C.\n\nThe resulting cost-effective, grass roots model intentionally targeted deeper learning outcomes with carefully selected deeper learning methods. It was piloted in an urban school with a large English Language Learning population, a suburban affluent district with four schools and a suburban, but economically and racially changing district, all using limited but existing funds.\n\nAt the same time that site administrators and teachers participated in a year-long, twice monthly interaction with the \"MindQuest21\" team, that same team interacted with district administrators to change systemwide practices to those ways of leading that would readily support the new focus on deeper learning practices and outcomes. What emerged was a scalable and sustainable model for changing the school and district systems so that the systems, including teacher evaluation, would support new approaches to teaching and learning in \"every\" classroom and a multi-faceted system of evaluation would show significant deeper learning (including standardized test content) gains for students, their schools and the district. It would also show to any visitor that a different way of teaching and learning existed as the norm in every classroom, engaging students every moment of the day in deeper learning processes aimed at explicit deeper learning outcomes.\n\nThe MindQuest21 approach was not an isolated example. As the P21 Exemplar identification program showed, more and more schools, often acting alone, sometimes in concert with other schools in a district, were shifting the learning paradigm from surface learning pushed by NCLB recall tests to deeper learning stimulated by entrepreneurial administrators and teachers. In a like manner, creative teachers who were able to defy the punishment threats of NCLB, did the same.\n\nThe majority of tests used in the current U.S. school system focus mainly on achievement of content knowledge and rely heavily on multiple-choice items, measuring primarily low-level knowledge and some basic skills. A study by the RAND Corporation found that, in the 17 states studied, fewer than 2% of mathematics items and only about 20% of English language arts (ELA) items on state tests ask students to analyze, synthesize, compare, critique, investigate, prove, or explain their ideas.\n\nHowever, two federally funded multi-state assessment consortia—the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) and the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium (SBAC) —were formed to develop next-generation assessment tools, to be launched in 2014–15. Research conducted by UCLA's CRESST show marked increases in the amount of higher-order skills to be assessed as measured by the Depth of Knowledge scale. The Innovation Lab Network (ILN) of states, coordinated by the Council of Chief State School Officers, convenes a smaller, informal consortium of ten states to develop strategies to create and deploy even more intellectually ambitious assessments. The performance assessments under development by participating states includes tasks that require students to analyze, critique, evaluate, and apply knowledge. The new tests also intend to encourage instruction aimed at helping students acquire and use knowledge in more complex ways.\n\nIn September 2014, a report was released by the American Institutes for Research on a three-year, quasi-experimental comparison of traditional and Deeper Learning schools. The research findings demonstrated the following improved student outcomes: students attending deeper learning network schools benefited from greater opportunities to engage in deeper learning and reported higher levels of academic engagement, motivation to learn, self-efficacy, and collaboration skills; students had higher state standardized assessment scores regardless of student background; students scored higher on PISA-based Test for Schools on measures of core content knowledge and complex problem-solving skills; students graduated on time at statistically significantly higher rates (9 percent); and after graduation students were more likely to attend four-year colleges and enroll in more selective institutions.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4784544", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4784544", "title": "Dogū", "text": "Dogū\n\nEveryday ceramic items from the period are called Jōmon pottery.\n\nSome scholars theorize the Dogū acted as effigies of people, that manifested some kind of sympathetic magic. For example, it may have been believed that illnesses could be transferred into the Dogū, then destroyed, clearing the illness, or any other misfortune.\n\nDogū are made of clay and are small, typically 10 to 30 cm high. Most of the figurines appear to be modeled as female, and have big eyes, small waists, and wide hips. They are considered by many to be representative of goddesses. Many have large abdomens associated with pregnancy, suggesting that the Jomon considered them mother goddesses. According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, these figurines \"suggest an association with fertility and shamanistic rites\". The dogū tend to have large faces, small arms and hands and compact bodies. Some appear to wear goggles or have \"heart-shaped\" faces. Most have marks on the face, chest and shoulders, that suggest tattooing and probable incision with bamboo.\n\n\nThe , or \"goggle-eyed dogū,\" were created in the Jōmon era, and are so well known that when most Japanese hear the term \"dogū\", this is the image that comes to mind. The name \"shakōki\" (literally \"light-blocking device\") comes from the resemblance of the figures' eyes to traditional Inuit snow goggles. Another distinguishing feature of the objects are the exaggerated, feminine buttocks, chest and thighs. Furthermore, the abdomen is covered with patterns, many of which seem to have been painted with vermilion. The larger figures are hollow, presumably in order to prevent cracking during the firing process.\n\nUnbroken figures are rare, and most are missing an arm, leg or other body part. In many cases, the parts have been cut off. One theory is that parts of the figures may have been cut off in fertility rituals.\n\nThese types of dogū have been found in the Kamegaoka Site in Tsugaru, Aomori Prefecture; the Teshiromori Site in Morioka, Iwate Prefecture; the Ebisuda Site in Tajiri, Miyagi Prefecture; and the Izumisawa Kaizuka Site in Ishinomaki, Miyagi Prefecture.

Construction of a new route for Line 3 has been proposed by the Canadian oil company, Enbridge. While this project was easily approved in Canada, Wisconsin, and North Dakota, the proposed pipeline has received resistance from environmental groups and U.S. Native American communities in Minnesota.\n\nConstruction on the original Line 3 pipeline started in 1962. It began operating in 1968 to meet growing U.S. demand for oil. Since its construction, the pipeline has carried on average between 390,000 and 760,000 barrels of oil per day. Numerous structural anomalies have developed along the pipeline over time. These holes, and concerns about the safety of the pipeline, have led Enbridge to reduce the amount of oil transported daily. Enbridge announced plans to build the new Line 3 in 2014. That multi-billion dollar project would allow Enbridge to restore their historic operating capacity and move nearly 800,000 barrels per day.\n\nWhile governing bodies in Canada, North Dakota, and Wisconsin had approved their segments of the pipeline by 2016, approval took longer in Minnesota where environmentalists have resisted the project. In advance of their decision on Line 3 the MN Public Utilities Commission (PUC) solicited public input about Line 3. Most feedback they received opposed the pipeline. Of the nearly 70,000 individual comments that were submitted, 68,244, or 94%, voiced opposition to the pipeline's completion. However, in June 2018 the PUC granted Enbridge the Certificate of Need and approved their desired route for Line 3. Environmentalists and Native communities in the state have pledged to resist the pipeline's construction.\n\nMuch of the resistance to the Line 3 project comes from concerns over climate change. Environmental groups such as the North Star Chapter of the Sierra Club, MN350, and Honor the Earth have anti-Line 3 campaigns. The Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which was conducted by the Minnesota Department of Commerce, explains how the new Line 3 pipeline would contribute to deforestation, increase risk of pollution to Minnesota's pristine water ecosystems and wild rice beds, and generate greenhouse gasses that contribute to climate change. Since the publication of the EIS, the MN Department of Commerce has formally denounced the proposed Line 3 project on environmental grounds, going so far as to say that they would prefer to see the old pipeline cease operations:\n\nOne specific concern about the project is the potential for oil spills along Line 3. In recent years, Enbridge has safely transported 99.999% of oil. However, among other accidental releases, the original Line 3 pipeline was responsible for the largest ever inland oil spill in the U.S. In 1991, 1.7 million gallons of oil ruptured from Line 3 in Grand Rapids, MN. Enbridge was also responsible for the 2010 spill on the Kalamazoo river in Michigan. After 8 years and over a billion dollars spent, that spill is still being cleaned up. The resulting pollution has adversely affected the economy, public health, and the environment in MIchigan. Enbridge has consistently reassured the public that pipeline safety is their primary goal. They employ technology to monitor pipelines, and train employees on emergency response. While significant oil spills (>238 barrels of oil) have decreased in recent years, organizers in Minnesota feel that the potential for even one serious spill is too much of a risk. The Environmental Impact Statement on Line 3 acknowledges that some accidental release of oil is inevitable and that serious oil spills are possible.\n\nMany Native communities in Minnesota oppose Line 3. Five Anishinaabe tribes, the White Earth, Red Lake, Mille Lacs, Fond du Lac, and Leech Lake bands hold status as intervening parties against the project in the PUC's permit deliberations. The Environmental Impact Statement acknowledges that the construction of Line 3 would disrupt tribal cultural sites such as burial grounds and historic locales, and degrade natural resources such as wild rice beds and healthy water ecosystems. A complete Traditional Cultural Properties Survey has not been conducted of the proposed route. One will not take place unless a permit for construction is granted to Enbridge. This lack has been criticized by tribal groups. The Minnesota Chippewa Tribe, in conjunction with Honor the Earth, an Indigenous climate justice organization, released their own assessment of the cultural and environmental determinants Line 3 would have on their land. The Chippewa Cumulative Impact Assessment reflects grave concern in that community and strongly opposes the pipeline's construction. In response to such concerns, Enbridge has an 'Indigenous Peoples Policy' which lays out guidelines for the company's work on Native land.\n\nAnother debate surrounding the proposed Line 3 project is what will happen to the infrastructure of the old Line 3. Enbridge has proposed a process they call \"deactivation.\" Many who oppose the project call it \"abandonment.\" Enbridge explains deactivation of a pipeline as a 5 step process: remove the oil, clean the pipe, disconnect it from facilities, put corrosion controls in place, and then leave the pipe in the ground. The method that Enbridge would use to prevent corrosion is called cathodic protection. Minnesotans for Pipeline Cleanup, an organization opposed to Line 3, has expressed concerns about the efficacy of that process. Many landowners along the old route worry that they will bear the financial burden for the decommissioned pipe, either through costs of cleanup, removal, or lost property value. Both the Pipeline Abandonment Report from Minnesotans for Pipeline Cleanup and the Chippewa Cumulative Impact Statement mention that Line 3 would be the first pipeline ever to be decommissioned in MN, and try to interrogate what sort of precedent that might set.\n\nMany Minnesotans support the Line 3 project for its potential to support the economy of communities along the route. Enbridge has said that thousands of jobs will be created as a result of the pipeline's construction. However, the Environmental Impact Statement draws a distinction between the temporary employment that would be available during construction and the likelihood of long term job creation:\n\nIn addition to job creation, Line 3 supporters also cite the positive impact that Enbridge property taxes could have on communities in Northern Minnesota. In the first year of the new Line 3's operations, Enbridge would pay $19.5 million in property taxes along the route. That number would increase over time. Organizers hold some reservations about how impactful that revenue might be, citing Enbridge's recent lawsuit in which their claim that they had been overtaxed indebted counties across Minnesota to Enbridge for tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAnother argument in support of the pipeline ties safety to the economic concept of supply and demand. Recent studies have highlighted that train and truck transportation of oil results in more regular spills than transport by pipe. Among their arguments in support of the pipeline, Minnesotans for Line 3 cites the growing number of trains transporting oil through the state. They argue that, due to high U.S. demand, oil will be moved through the states by whatever means are available. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, also advanced this argument in his public endorsement of the Canadian section of Line 3:\n\nEnbridge estimates that Line 3 would replace more than 10,000 rail cars or 24,000 tanker trucks transporting oil everyday. Minnesotans for Line 3 say that by approving the pipeline, government regulators could ensure safer transport of millions of barrels of oil a year. The MN Department of Commerce, in their testimony against Line 3, questioned these projections, claiming that they depend on an unrealistic idea of the future demand of oil.\n\nEnbridge's key argument in support of the pipeline relates to that critique from the Department of Commerce. Today, U.S. Americans consume more petroleum than any other source of energy. Oil and its byproducts fuel cars, pave roads, and even make up the foundation for many cosmetic products and synthetic fabrics. Enbridge calls Line 3 a \"vital link,\" supplying that highly demanded oil to Minnesota and the United States. While many analysts in the industry believe that demand for oil will eventually begin to fall, no one can predict when that will be. Some environmentalists worry about future decreased demand, concerned with the notion of stranded assets. A stranded asset is equipment or a product that can't be turned into profit because of some change in the demand. Environmentalists raise the question of what will happen to oil infrastructure when the companies that owned them are no longer profitable or cease to operate.\n\nWith environmentalists vowing to fight the pipeline, government officials are concerned about what sort of resistance might materialize as construction begins. Commentators have compared the potential resistance to the front line protests over the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines. Environmentalists have already pursued legal intervention, direct action, and more creative resistance to the pipeline, so officials along the route fear that the next phase of resistance to Line 3 could incur high security costs and disruption to life along the proposed route.\n"}

It employs a number of methods, techniques, analyses, and approaches, based upon archaeological source material such as ancient structures or artifacts.\n\nIt is distinct from uses of primitive technology without any concern for archaeological or historical study. Living history and historical reenactment, which are generally undertaken as a hobby, are the non archaeological person's version of this academic discipline.\n\nOne of the main forms of experimental archaeology is the creation of copies of historical structures using only historically accurate technologies. This is sometimes known as reconstruction archaeology or reconstructional archaeology; however, reconstruction implies an exact replica of the past, when it is in fact just a construction of one person's idea of the past; the more archaeologically correct term is a \"working construction of the past\". In recent years, experimental archaeology has been featured in several television productions, such as BBC's \"Building the Impossible\" and the PBS's \"Secrets of Lost Empires\". Most notable were the attempts to create several of Leonardo da Vinci's designs from his sketchbooks, such as his 15th century armed fighting vehicle.\n\nA good example is Butser Ancient Farm in the English county of Hampshire which is a working replica of an Iron Age farmstead where long-term experiments in prehistoric agriculture, animal husbandry, and manufacturing are held to test ideas posited by archaeologists. In Denmark, the Lejre Experimental Centre carries out even more ambitious work on such diverse topics as artificial Bronze Age and Iron Age burials, prehistoric science and stone tool manufacture in the absence of flint.\n\nOther examples include:\n\nOther types of experimental archaeology may involve burying modern replica artifacts and ecofacts for varying lengths of time to analyse the post-depositional effects on them. Other archaeologists have built modern earthworks and measured the effects of silting in the ditches and weathering and subsidence on the banks to understand better how ancient monuments would have looked. One example is Overton Down in England.\n\nThe work of flintknappers is also a kind of experimental archaeology as much has been learnt about the many different types of flint tools through the hands-on approach of actually making them. Experimental archaeologists have equipped modern professional butchers, archers and lumberjacks with replica flint tools to judge how effective they would have been for certain tasks. Use wear traces on the modern flint tools are compared to similar traces on archaeological artifacts, making probability hypotheses on the possible kind of use feasible. Hand axes have been shown to be particularly effective at cutting animal meat from the bone and jointing it.\n\nAnother field of experimental archaeology is illustrated by the studies of the stone flaking abilities of non-human primates. It has been demonstrated that bonobos are able to produce modified cores and flaked stones which are morphologically similar to early lithic industries in East Africa.\n\nThe subject has proven popular enough to spawn several re-creation-type television shows: \n\n\n"}

Such a grid does not have a straightforward relationship to latitude and longitude, but conforms to many of the main criteria for a statistically valid discrete global grid. Primarily, the cells' area and shape are generally similar, especially near the poles where many other spatial grids have singularities or heavy distortion. The popular Quaternary Triangular Mesh (QTM) falls into this category.\n\nGeodesic grids may use the dual polyhedron of the geodesic polyhedron, which is the Goldberg polyhedron. Goldberg polyhedra are made up of hexagons and (if based on the icosahedron) 12 pentagons.

{"id": "2382395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2382395", "title": "Grammatical relation", "text": "Grammatical relation\n\nIn linguistics, grammatical relations (also called grammatical functions, grammatical roles, or syntactic functions) refer to functional relationships between constituents in a clause. The standard examples of grammatical functions from traditional grammar are subject, direct object, and indirect object. In recent times, the syntactic functions (more generally referred to as grammatical relations), typified by the traditional categories of subject and object, have assumed an important role in linguistic theorizing, within a variety of approaches ranging from generative grammar to functional and cognitive theories. Many modern theories of grammar are likely to acknowledge numerous further types of grammatical relations (e.g. complement, specifier, predicative, etc.). The role of grammatical relations in theories of grammar is greatest in dependency grammars, which tend to posit dozens of distinct grammatical relations. Every head-dependent dependency bears a grammatical function.\n\nThe grammatical relations are exemplified in traditional grammar by the notions of subject, direct object, and indirect object:\n\nThe subject \"Fred\" performs or is the source of the action. The direct object \"the book\" is acted upon by the subject, and the indirect object Susan receives the direct object or otherwise benefits from the action. Traditional grammars often begin with these rather vague notions of the grammatical functions. When one begins to examine the distinctions more closely, it quickly becomes clear that these basic definitions do not provide much more than a loose orientation point.\n\nWhat is indisputable about the grammatical relations is that they are relational. That is, subject and object can exist as such only by virtue of the context in which they appear. A noun such as \"Fred\" or a noun phrase such as \"the book\" cannot qualify as subject and direct object, respectively, unless they appear in an environment, e.g. a clause, where they are related to each other and/or to an action or state. In this regard, the main verb in a clause is responsible for assigning grammatical relations to the clause \"participants\".\n\nMost grammarians and students of language intuitively know in most cases what the subject and object in a given clause are. But when one attempts to produce theoretically satisfying definitions of these notions, the results are usually less than clear and therefore controversial. The contradictory impulses have resulted in a situation where most theories of grammar acknowledge the grammatical relations and rely on them heavily for describing phenomena of grammar but at the same time, avoid providing concrete definitions of them. Nevertheless, various principles can be acknowledged that attempts to define the grammatical relations are based on.\n\nThe thematic relations (=thematic roles, semantic roles, e.g. agent, patient, theme, goal, etc.) can provide semantic orientation for defining the grammatical relations. There is a tendency for subjects to be agents and objects to be patients or themes. However, the thematic relations cannot be substituted for the grammatical relations, nor vice versa. This point is evident with the active-passive diathesis and ergative verbs:\n\n\"Marge\" is the agent in the first pair of sentences because she initiates and carries out the action of fixing, and \"the coffee table\" is the patient in both because it is acted upon in both sentences. In contrast, the subject and direct object are not consistent across the two sentences. The subject is the agent \"Marge\" in the first sentence and the patient \"The coffee table\" in the second sentence. The direct object is the patient \"the coffee table\" in the first sentence, and there is no direct object in the second sentence. The situation is similar with the ergative verb \"sunk/sink\" in the second pair of sentences. The noun phrase \"the ship\" is the theme in both sentences, although it is the object in the first of the two and the subject in the second.\n\nThe grammatical relations belong to the level of surface syntax, whereas the thematic relations reside on a deeper semantic level. If, however, the correspondences across these levels are acknowledged, then the thematic relations can be seen as providing prototypical thematic traits for defining the grammatical relations.\n\nAnother prominent means used to define the syntactic relations is in terms of the syntactic configuration. The subject is defined as the verb argument that appears outside of the canonical finite verb phrase, whereas the object is taken to be the verb argument that appears inside the verb phrase. This approach takes the configuration as primitive, whereby the grammatical relations are then derived from the configuration. This \"configurational\" understanding of the grammatical relations is associated with Chomskyan phrase structure grammars (Transformational grammar, Government and Binding and Minimalism).\n\nThe configurational approach is limited in what it can accomplish. It works best for the subject and object arguments. For other clause participants (e.g. attributes and modifiers of various sorts, prepositional arguments, etc.), it is less insightful, since it is often not clear how one might define these additional syntactic functions in terms of the configuration. Furthermore, even concerning the subject and object, it can run into difficulties, e.g.\n\nThe configurational approach has difficulty with such cases. The plural verb \"were\" agrees with the post-verb noun phrase \"two lizards\", which suggests that \"two lizards\" is the subject. But since \"two lizards\" follows the verb, one might view it as being located inside the verb phrase, which means it should count as the object. This second observation suggests that the expletive \"there\" should be granted subject status.\n\nMany efforts to define the grammatical relations emphasize the role inflectional morphology. In English, the subject can or must agree with the finite verb in person and number, and in languages that have morphological case, the subject and object (and other verb arguments) are identified in terms of the case markers that they bear (e.g. nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, ergative, absolutive, etc.). Inflectional morphology may be a more reliable means for defining the grammatical relations than the configuration, but its utility can be very limited in many cases. For instance, inflectional morphology is not going to help in languages that lack inflectional morphology almost entirely such as Mandarin, and even with English, inflectional morphology does not help much, since English largely lacks morphological case.\n\nThe difficulties facing attempts to define the grammatical relations in terms of thematic or configurational or morphological criteria can be overcome by an approach that posits protoyptical traits. The prototypical subject has a cluster of thematic, configurational, and/or morphological traits, and the same is true of the prototypical object and other verb arguments. Across languages and across constructions within a language, there can be many cases where a given subject argument may not be a prototypical subject, but it has enough subject-like traits to be granted subject status. Similarly, a given object argument may not be prototypical in one way or another, but if it has enough object-like traits, then it can nevertheless receive the status of object.\n\nThis third strategy is tacitly preferred by most work in theoretical syntax. All those theories of syntax that avoid providing concrete definitions of the grammatical relations but yet reference them often are (perhaps unknowingly) pursuing an approach in terms of prototypical traits.\n\nThe importance of the syntactic functions (= grammatical relations) reaches its greatest extent in dependency grammar (DG) theories of syntax. Every head-dependent dependency bears a syntactic function. The result is that an inventory consisting of dozens of distinct syntactic functions is needed for each language. For example, a determiner-noun dependency might be assumed to bear the DET (determiner) function, and an adjective-noun dependency is assumed to bear the ATTR (attribute) function. These functions are often produced as labels on the dependencies themselves in the syntactic tree, e.g.\n\nThe tree contains the following syntactic functions: ATTR (attribute), CCOMP (clause complement), DET (determiner), MOD (modifier), OBJ (object), SUBJ (subject), and VCOMP (verb complement). The actual inventories of syntactic functions will differ from the one suggested here in the number and types of functions that are assumed. In this regard, this tree is merely intended to be illustrative of the importance that the syntactic functions can take on in some theories of syntax and grammar.\n\n\n"}

The two statues were both placed in the Palazzo Dei Convervatori for safe keeping in 1950 and remain there today. The Hercules of Forum Boarium was likely to have been a cult image of Temple of Hercules that stood by the ancient cattle market.\n\nThe bronze sculpture is slightly over life-sized and is in the Hellenistic style of the second century BCE. The Hellenistic style was based on the canon of proportions that had been established by Lysippos in the early fourth century BCE. The muscles on the sculpture are exaggerated and the head is proportionally smaller when compared to the rest of the body. The Forum Boarium statue is one of the two surviving full-sized Greek statues from ancient Greece. The second Hercules statue was discovered near the Theatre of Pompey. The Hercules of the Theatre of Pompey had been carefully buried under protective tiles and uncised FCS (Fulgor Conditum Summanium) because it was constantly hit by lightning. The Hercules of the Theatre of Pompey depicts him leaning on his club vertically as he holds the apple of Hesperides in his left hand. On his left forearm, he has draped the skin of the Nemean Lion that he defeated on his first Labor.\nBoth sculptures display contrapposto, a typical style from Lysippos in which the figure's weight is thrown entirely on one foot. Though their muscles are exaggerated, they stand in marked contrast to the bearded, burly and perhaps more familiar \"Farnese Hercules\".\n\nThe statue of Hercules from Forum Boarium is based on his twelve labors where he must bring back the Golden Apples of Hesperides to Eurystheus. Hercules found Prometheus during his search and freed him from his prison. In return, Prometheus told him where he could find the Golden Apples. The apples were guarded by a hundred-headed dragon named Ladon who could not be conquered by Hercules. To defeat Ladon, he needed the help of Atlas, the titan that held the Earth and Heavens on his shoulder. Hercules managed to convince Atlas to help him get the apples, but in exchange, Hercules would have to carry the weight of the world while Atlas acquired the apples. When Atlas returned with the apples, he did not want to retake the weight of the world back. Hercules tricked Atlas by saying that he would gladly stay and hold up the world, but asked Atlas if he could take the weight again so he can adjust his cloak. Atlas took back the weight of the world and Hercules immediately picked up the Golden Apples and ran off..\n\nThe temple of the Forum Boarium in Rome is located by the Tiber River. The statue was first created for the cult of Ara Maxima, which was dedicated to Hercules by the Greek king Evander. Legend states that the statue was created to commemorate the story of Hercules killing the robber Cacus who attempted stealing cattle from Geryon. During the early Renaissance, the little that was left of the temple was demolished under the orders of Sixtus IV. The temple was converted into a church. This statue of Hercules was moved to the Palazzo dei Conservatori on the Campidoglio in 1510 The statue of Hercules Aemilianus is believed to have been commissioned by either Aemilius Paullus, who dedicated a tomb to Hercules, or by Scipio Aemilianus. The statue was found after Romans demolished a portion to create space for their new rotunda. There are two ancient temples where the statue may have been displayed: the temple located between Circus Maximus and the Church of Santa Maria and the temple of Hercules Ameliana.

{"id": "2383366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2383366", "title": "Hexis", "text": "Hexis\n\nHexis () is a relatively stable arrangement or disposition, for example a person's health or knowledge or character. It is an Ancient Greek word, important in the philosophy of Aristotle, and because of this it has become a traditional word of philosophy. It stems from a verb related to possession or \"having\", and Jacob Klein, for example, translates it as \"possession\". It is more typically translated in modern texts occasionally as \"state\" (e.g., H. Rackham), but more often as \"disposition\". Joe Sachs translates it as \"active condition\", in order to make sure that \"hexis\" is not confused with passive conditions of the soul, such as feelings and impulses or mere capacities that belong to us by nature. Sachs points to Aristotle's own distinction, explained for example in \"Categories\" 8b, which distinguishes the word \"diathesis\", normally uncontroversially translated as disposition. In this passage, \"diathesis\" only applies to passive and shallow dispositions that are easy to remove and change, such as being hot or cold, while \"hexis\" is reserved for deeper and more active dispositions, such as properly getting to know something in a way that it will not be easily forgotten. Another common example of a human \"hexis\" in Aristotle is health (\"hugieia\", or sometimes \"eu(h)exia\", in Greek) and in cases where \"hexis\" is discussed in the context of health, it is sometimes translated as \"constitution\".\n\nApart from needing to be relatively stable or permanent, in contexts concerning humans (such as knowledge, health, and good character) \"hexis\" is also generally understood to be contrasted from other dispositions, conditions and habits, by being \"acquired\" by some sort of training or other habituation.\n\nAccording to Plotinus, virtue is a hexis of the soul that is not primarily related to praxis and habituation; hexis is a quality of being in an active state of possession that intellectualizes the soul in permanent contemplation of the intelligible world (Enn. VI.8.5.3–37).\n\nOther uses also occur, for example it is sometimes translated as \"habit\", based upon the classical translation from Greek to Latin \"habitus\", which also comes from a verb indicating having.\n\nBeing in a truly fixed state, as opposed to being stable, is not implied in the original Aristotelian usage of this word. He uses the example of \"health\" being a \"hexis\".\n\nSo according to Aristotle, a \"hexis\" is a type of \"disposition\" (diathesis) which he in turn describes in the same as follows...\n\nAnd specifically it is the type of disposition \"in virtue of which (\"kath' ho\") the thing which is disposed is disposed well or badly, and either independently or in relation to something else\".\n\nThe wording \"in virtue of which\" was also described in the same passage...\n\nIn Aristotle then, a \"hexis\" is an arrangement of parts such that the arrangement might have excellence, being well arranged, or in contrast, might be badly arranged. Also see Aristotle's Categories viii where a hexis (\"habit\" in the translation of Edghill) is contrasted with a disposition (\"diathesis\") in terms of it being more permanent and less easy to change. The example given is \"knowledge\" (\"epistemē\").\n\nIn perhaps the most important case, Aristotle contrasted \"hexis\" with \"energeia\" (in the sense of activity or operation) at Nicomachean Ethics I.viii.1098b33 and Eudemian Ethics II.i.1218b. The subject here was \"eudaimonia\", the proper aim of human life, often translated as \"happiness\" and \"hexis\" is contrasted with \"energeia\" (ἐνέργεια) in order to show the correctness of a proposed definition of \"eudaimonia\" - \"activity (ἐνέργεια) in conformity with virtue\"\n\nHappiness then, is an \"energeia\", but virtue of character (often translated as \"moral virtue\") is made up of \"hexeis\". Happiness is said to deserve honoring like the divine if it actually achieved, while virtue of character, being only a potential achievement, deserves praise but is lower.\n\n...and defined in the Strong's concordance...\n\n"}
{"id": "11234681", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11234681", "title": "Interpersonal deception theory", "text": "Interpersonal deception theory\n\nInterpersonal deception theory\n\n(IDT) attempts to explain how individuals handle actual (or perceived) deception at the conscious or subconscious level while engaged in face-to-face communication. IDT assumes that communication is not static; it is influenced by personal goals and the meaning of the interaction as it unfolds. The sender's overt (and covert) communications are affected by the overt and covert communications of the receiver, and vice versa. Intentional deception requires greater cognitive exertion than truthful communication, regardless of whether the sender attempts falsification (lying), concealment (omitting material facts) or equivocation (skirting issues by changing the subject or responding indirectly). IDT explores the interrelation between the sender's communicative meaning and the receiver's thoughts and behavior in deceptive exchanges.\n\nIDT views deception through the lens of interpersonal communication, considering deception as an interactive process between sender and receiver. In contrast with previous studies of deception (which focused on the sender and receiver individually), IDT focuses on the dyadic and relational nature of deceptive communication. Behaviors by sender and receiver are dynamic, multifunctional, multidimensional and multi-modal.\n\nDyadic communication is communication between two people; a dyad is a group of two people between whom messages are sent and received. Relational communication is communication in which meaning is created by two people simultaneously filling the roles of sender and receiver. Dialogic activity is the active communicative language of the sender and receiver, each relying upon the other in the exchange.\n\nIn psychotherapy and psychological counseling, dyadic, relational and dialogic activity between therapist and patient relies on honest, open communication if the patient is to recover and be capable of healthier relationships. Deception uses the same theoretical framework in reverse; the communication of one participant is deliberately false.\n\nSigmund Freud studied nonverbal cues to detect deception about a century ago. Freud observed a patient being asked about his darkest feelings. If his mouth was shut and his fingers were trembling, he was considered to be lying. In 1989, DePaulo and Kirkendol developed the Motivation Impairment Effect (MIE). MIE states the harder people try to deceive others, the more likely they are to get caught. Burgoon and Floyd, however, revisited this research and formed the idea that deceivers are more active in their attempt to deceive than most would anticipate or expect.\n\nIDT was developed by two communication professors, David B. Buller and Judee K. Burgoon. Prior to their study, deception had not been fully considered as a communication activity. Previous work had focused upon the formulation of principles of deception. These principles were derived by evaluating the lie detection ability of individuals observing unidirectional communication. These early studies found initially that \"although humans are far from infallible in their efforts to diagnose lies, they are substantially better at the task than would result merely by chance.\" Buller and Burgoon discount the value of highly controlled studies – usually one-way communication experiments – designed to isolate unmistakable cues that people are lying. Therefore, IDT is based on two-way communication and intended to describe deception as an interaction communicative process.\n\nIDT's model of interpersonal deception has 18 verifiable propositions. Based on assumptions of interpersonal communication and deception, each proposition can generate a testable hypothesis. Although some propositions originated in IDT, many are derived from earlier research. The propositions attempt to explain the cognition and behavior of sender and receiver during the process of deception, from before interaction through interaction to the outcome after interaction.\n\nIDT's explanations of interpersonal deception depend on the situation in which interaction occurs and the relationship between sender and receiver. \n\nIndividuals approach deceptive exchanges with factors such as expectancy, knowledge, goals or intentions and behaviors reflecting their communication competence. IDT posits that these factors influence the deceptive exchange.\n\nIDT posits that factors before the interaction influence the sender's deception and fear of detection.\n\nIDT also posits that factors before the interaction, combined with initial behavior, affect receiver suspicion and detection accuracy.\n\nIDT describes receiver suspicion and sender reaction.\n\nIDT posits that interaction between sender and receiver influences how credible the receiver thinks the sender is and how suspicious the sender thinks the receiver is.\n\nAlthough most people believe they can spot deception, IDT posits that they cannot. A deceiver must manages his or her verbal and nonverbal cues to ensure that what they are saying appears true. According to IDT, the more socially aware a receiver is, the better he or she is at detecting deceit.\n\nIn a common social agreement, people are honest with one another and believe that others will be honest with them. If a deceiver begins a deceptive exchange with an accurate statement, the statement may induce the receiver to believe the rest of the deceiver's story is also true. The sender prepares the receiver to accept his or her information as truth, even if some (or all) of the dialogue is false. If the sender repeats the same tactic, the receiver will become more aware that the sender is lying.\n\nEmotion plays a central role in IDT as a motivation and result of deception. Emotion can motivate deception, with the sender relying on relevant knowledge (informational, relational and behavioral familiarity) to achieve goals such as self-gratification, avoiding a negative emotional outcome or creating a negative emotional outcome for the target of deception. Emotion can be a result of deception, since a physical response occurs in the sender (usually arousal and negative affect).\n\nLeakage in deception is manifested most overtly in nonverbal signals; studies indicate that over 90 percent of emotional meaning is communicated non-verbally. Humans are sensitive to body signals, and communication is often ambiguous; something is communicated verbally and its opposite non-verbally. Leakage occurs when nonverbal signals betray the true content of a contradictory verbal message. Facial expression is difficult to read, and the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a means of uncovering deception. Small facial movements, known as micro-expressions, can be detected in this system using action units.\n\nAction units (AUs) can be examined frame by frame, since these micro-expressions are often rapid. Paul Ekman’s research in facial deception has found several constants in certain expressions, with the action units relating to lip-corner pulling (AU12) and cheek-raising (AU6) qualifiers for happiness in most people. Brow-lowering (AU4) and lip-stretching (AU20) are disqualifiers for happiness. Emotional leakage appears in these fleeting expressions.\n\nA study of Ekman’s observations revealed that AUs appear in over 90 percent of facial expressions. Despite the progress of the facial deception theory and the use of video to capture micro-expressions, it is more practical to search the body for signs of betraying what the sender is trying to communicate. The following signs may indicate deception: \n\nUniversity of Virginia social psychologist Bella DePaulo has said, \"Facial cues ... are indeed faking cues\".\n\nSeven basic emotions are communicated through facial expression: anger, fear, sadness, joy, disgust, surprise and contempt. These emotions are recognized universally. These expressions are innate of develop through socialization.\n\nCultures have a variety of rules governing the social use of facial expression; for example, the Japanese discourage the display of negative emotions. Individuals may find it difficult to control facial expression, and the face may \"leak\" information about how they feel.\n\nPeople use eye contact to indicate threat, intimacy and interest. Eye contact is used to regulate turn-taking in conversation, and indicates how interested the listener (receiver) is in what the speaker is saying. Receivers make eye contact about 70–75 percent of the time, with each contact averaging 7.8 seconds.\n\nGestures are among the most culture-specific forms of nonverbal communication, and may lead to misinterpretation. Involuntary self-touching, such as touching the face, scratching, gripping the hands together or putting the hands in (or near) the mouth, occur when people experience intense emotions such as depression, elation or extreme anxiety.\n\nEkman and Friesen demonstrated gesture leakage by showing films of a depressed woman to a group, which was asked to judge the woman's mood. Those shown only the woman's face thought she was happy and cheerful, while the group who saw only her body thought she was tense and disturbed.\n\nTouch can reassure and indicate understanding. Humans touch one another in sexual intimacy, affiliation and understanding; in greetings and farewells; as an act of aggression, and to demonstrate dominance. According to Argyle (1996), there \"appear to be definite rules which permit certain kinds of touch, between certain people, on certain occasions only. Bodily contact outside these narrow limits is unacceptable\".\n\nDePaulo, Ansfield and Bell questioned IDT: \"We can find the 'why' question in Buller and Burgoon's synthesis. There is no intriguing riddle or puzzle that needs to be solved, and no central explanatory mechanism is ever described.\" Although they praised Buller and Burgoon's 18 propositions as a comprehensive description of the timeline of deceptive interactions, they said the propositions lacked the interconnectedness and predictive power of a unifying theory. DePaulo \"et al.\" criticized IDT for failing to distinguish between interactive communication (which emphasizes the situational and contextual aspects of communicative exchanges) from interpersonal communication, which emphasizes exchanges in which the sender and receiver make psychological predictions about the other's behavior based on specific prior knowledge; this conceptual ambiguity limited IDT's explanatory power.\n\nBuller and Burgoon have conducted over two dozen experiments in which they ask participants to deceive another person, and the researchers have found that people often find themselves in situations where they make statements that are not completely honest \"to avoid hurting or offending another person, to emphasize their best qualities, to avoid getting into a conflict, or to speed up or slow down a relationship\".\n\nBuller and Burgoon asked participants to put themselves in the following situation:\n\"You've been dating Pat for nearly three years and feel quite close in your relationship. Since Pat goes to a different school upstate, the two of you have agreed to date other people. Nevertheless, Pat is quite jealous and possessive. During the school year you see Pat only occasionally, but you call each other every Sunday and talk for over an hour. On Friday one of your friends invites you to a party on Saturday night, but the party is 'couples only' so you need a date. There's no way that Pat could come down for the weekend. You decide to ask someone from your class who you've been attracted to so that you can go to the party. The two of you go and have a great time. On Sunday afternoon, there's a knock on your door and it's Pat. Pat walks in and says, 'Decided to come down and surprise you, tried calling you all last night, but you weren't around. What were you doing? The researchers listed three possible responses: lying (\"I was at the library getting ready for my theory exam\"), telling part of the truth while omitting important details (\"Went to a party at a friend's apartment\") or being intentionally vague or evasive (\"Went out for a while\").\n\nA qualitative study investigated deception in online dating. The study focused on four questions: (1) About what characteristics are online daters deceptive? (2) What motivation do online daters have for their deception of others in the online-dating environment? (3) What perceptions do online daters have about other daters' deceit towards them in the online-dating environment? (4) How does deception affect romantic relationships formed in the online-dating environment? In an online survey, data was collected from 15 open-ended questions. The study had 52 participants, ranging in age from 21 to 37, and found that most online daters consider themselves (and others) mostly honest in their online self-presentation. Online daters who used deception were motivated to do so by the desire to attract partners and project a positive self-image. Daters were willing to overlook deception in others if they viewed the dishonesty as a slight exaggeration or a characteristic of little value to the dater. Despite deception, participants believe that the online-dating environment can develop successful romantic relationships.\n\n\n"}

She received her art training at a school in Bushey founded by Sir Hubert von Herkomer.\nFrom 1911 to 1913 she attended University College London and obtained a Certificate in Egyptology. Her teachers were Sir Flinders Petrie and Margaret Murray.\n\nIn 1927, Broome was invited to participate in a project being conducted in Egypt by the British School of Archeology. The participants, including archeologist Olga Tufnell, copied tomb inscriptions at Qua-El-Kebi, Egypt.\n\nIn 1929, Broome returned to Egypt to work as an artist with Canadian epigrapher Amice Calverley. Calverley had been hired by the Egypt Exploration Society in 1927 to copy the wall scenes in the Temple of Seti I, c. 1300 BC at Abydos. In the winter of 1928, a visit to Abydos by Mr. and Mrs. John D. Rockefeller Jr. changed the scope of the work being done. Rockefeller was so impressed with the painted reliefs and Calverley's photography like reproductions, that he decided to finance the entire project. As a patron of the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, he was also responsible for the Oriental Institute joining efforts on the temple endeavor with the Egypt Exploration Society.\n\nCalverley was appointed director of the Temple project. With the increased funds, Broome was hired as Calverley's assistant in 1929. During eight seasons at the Temple, the two women were responsible for all the paintings and replications, with the help of a small staff of artists. Besides using large photographs to record the reliefs, the artists penciled over lines and inscriptions for a completely accurate rendering.\n\nBroome and Calverley also used watercolor paintings to provide color to the reproductions, because only black and white photography was available at the time. The result of that effort is four volumes with coloured plates published by the University of Chicago between 1933 and 1958.\n\nThe artists lived together in a mudbrick house near the temple with two local servants. Broome and Calverley were actively involved in the life of the village, participating in feasts and ceremonies and often providing medical assistance to the villagers. The two women traveled together throughout Egypt, taking trains and often driving across the desert in a Jowett car they named Joey; Broome's impressions from that time are noted in letters and illustrations that were sent to her parents.\n\nBroome retired from Egyptology in 1937 and returned to England due to her father's illness. She later painted a number of watercolours of Egyptian villages and the surrounding landscape. Over seventy of her paintings are on permanent exhibit at the Bushey Museum in Bushey, England. Broome's letters and papers are at the Griffith Institute in Oxford, England.\n\nBroome's father, Washington Herbert Broome was a music and book publisher. He was a contemporary of William Morris, an influential designer in the British Arts and Crafts movement. W. Broome worked with Morris at the Kelmscott Press before establishing The Old Bourne Press with James Guthrie. In 1907, W. Broome built a house in Bushey that is now listed as a historically interesting building with Historic England. The Broome house \"Avalon\" was designed and built in the late Arts and Crafts Style. Myrtle Broome created painted panels and decorations throughout the house. She is also mentioned as being a designer and a craft worker, who designed for Liberty.\n\nAvalon is also listed as the home of Myrtle and Washington Broomes' business – \"Designers and Workers in Metal and Enamel\". Historic England describes the house as being \"of special interest as a building created for a designer and craftsman of the Arts and Crafts movement, containing a rich variety of decorative elements of the period designed by Broome and his daughter.\"\n\n\n"}

PRONOM was the first and remains, to date, the only operational public file format registry in the world, although the \"Magic File\" repository of the File Command has served this role in a less formal capacity for two decades. Other projects to develop technical registries, including the UK Digital Curation Centre's Representation Information Registry, and the Global Digital Format Registry project at Harvard University, are now in progress.\n\nPRONOM's origins lie in a requirement to have access to reliable technical information about the electronic records held by The National Archives. By definition, electronic records are not inherently human-readable - file formats encode information into a form which can only be processed and rendered comprehensible by very specific technological environments. The accessibility of that information is therefore highly vulnerable to technological obsolescence. Technical information about the structure of those file formats, and the software and hardware environments required to support them, is therefore a prerequisite for any digital preservation regime. PRONOM was developed to provide this function, initially as an internal resource for National Archives staff, and subsequently as public, web-based resource.\n\nThe first version of PRONOM was developed by The National Archives digital preservation department in March 2002. PRONOM 2 was released in December 2002, and provided support for the development of multi-lingual versions of the registry. The web-enabling of PRONOM (PRONOM 3) in February 2004 represented the starting point for the development of PRONOM as a major online resource for the international digital preservation community.\n\nPRONOM 4, released in October 2005, includes a significant reworking of the underlying data model to allow the capture of detailed technical information on file formats and support future interoperability with other planned registry systems, and the release of the DROID software for automatic file format identification.\n\nThe latest version PRONOM 5 was a relatively minor update to support improvements to DROID and was released in 2006. A much more substantial update is planned for 2007, which will include the exposure of core PRONOM functions through web services interfaces. This work forms part of the Seamless Flow programme to position The National Archives to receive and manage future government records in electronic formats.\n\nIn future, PRONOM may participate as a node in the planned Global Digital Format Registry project.\n\nThe National Archives won the 2007 Digital Preservation Award sponsored by the Digital Preservation Coalition, for its work on PRONOM and DROID.\n\nThe core technical registry supports a number of specific services:\n\nThe PRONOM registry provides a searchable web database of technical information about file formats, the software tools required to access them, and the technical environments required to access them. Users can search for formats and software using a variety of criteria, such as format or software name and file extension. PRONOM also holds information about support periods for software products, and can also be queried on this basis. In addition to on-screen viewing, registry information can be exported in XML, CSV and printer-friendly formats. The PRONOM website allows users to submit new information for inclusion in PRONOM.\n\nThe PRONOM Persistent Unique Identifier (PUID) is an extensible scheme of persistent, unique and unambiguous identifiers for records in the PRONOM registry. Such identifiers are fundamental to the exchange and management of digital objects, by allowing human or automated user agents to unambiguously identify, and share that identification of, the representation information required to support access to an object. This is a virtue both of the inherent uniqueness of the identifier, and of its binding to a definitive description of the representation information in a registry such as PRONOM.\n\nAt present, the PUID scheme is limited to one particular class of representation information: the format in which a digital object is encoded. Formats were considered a particular priority for such a scheme, as no existing, universally applicable system provides for this. Unix magic numbers and Macintosh data forks do provide some of this functionality, but the same is not true within DOS or Microsoft Windows environments. The three-character file extension is neither standardised nor unique, and is interpreted differently by different environments. Equally, the IANA MIME-type scheme does not provide sufficient granularity or coverage to satisfy the requirements for unique identifiers. The PUID scheme has been developed for the single purpose of providing such identifiers.\n\nThe scheme has been adopted as the recommended encoding scheme for describing file formats in the latest version of the \"UK e-Government Metadata Standard\". The scheme is designed to be extensible, and may be expanded in future to include other classes of representation information in PRONOM, such as compression methods, character encoding schemes, and operating systems.\n\nPUIDs can be expressed as Uniform Resource Identifiers using the info:pronom/ namespace, details of which are available from the info URI registry. Neither the PUID scheme, nor its expression as an info URI, supports any inherent dereferencing mechanism, i.e. a PUID does not resolve to a Uniform Resource Locator. However, The National Archives is planning to develop a range of services to expose PRONOM registry content, including a resolution service for PUIDs.\n\nDROID (Digital Record Object Identification) is a software tool developed by The National Archives to perform automated batch identification of file formats. It is one of a planned series of tools utilising PRONOM to provide specific digital preservation services. DROID uses internal (byte sequence) and external (file extension) signatures to identify and report the specific file format versions of digital files. These signatures are stored in an XML signature file, generated from information recorded in the PRONOM technical registry. New and updated signatures are regularly added to PRONOM, and DROID can be configured to automatically download updated signature files from the PRONOM website via web services.\n\nDROID allows files and folders to be selected from a file system for identification. After the identification process had been run, the results can be output in XML, CSV or printer-friendly formats.\n\nDROID is a platform-independent Java tool. It includes a documented, public API, and can be invoked from both GUI and command line interfaces.\n\nProposed future services include format risk assessments and preservation planning, and the automated generation of migration pathways for converting between formats.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15611519", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15611519", "title": "Political radicalism", "text": "Political radicalism\n\nThe term political radicalism (in political science known as radicalism) denotes political principles focused on altering social structures through revolutionary or other means and changing value systems in fundamental ways.\n\nDerived from the Latin (\"root\"), the denotation of radical has changed since its eighteenth-century coinage to comprehend the entire political spectrum—yet it retains the \"change at the root\" connotation fundamental to revolutionary societal change. Historically, radicalism has referred exclusively to the radical left (under the single category of far-left politics) and rarely incorporating far-right politics—though these may have revolutionary elements. The prominent exception is in the United States, where some consider radicalism to include both political extremes of the radical left and the radical right. In traditional labels of the spectrum of political thought, the opposite of radical – on the \"right\" of the political spectrum – is termed \"reactionary\".\n\nThe nineteenth-century \"Cyclopaedia of Political Science\" (1881, 1889) reports that \"radicalism is characterized less by its principles than by the manner of their application\". Conservatives often used the term \"radical\" pejoratively whereas contemporary left radicals used the term \"conservative\" derogatorily, thus contemporary denotations of \"radical\", \"radicalism\" and \"political radicalism\" comprise far-left (hard left, radical left) and far-right (hard right, radical right).\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" records the first political usage of \"radical\" as ascribed to the British Whig Party parliamentarian Charles James Fox, who in 1797 proposed a \"radical reform\" of the electoral system, franchise to provide universal manhood suffrage, thereby idiomatically establishing \"radical\" to denote supporters of the reformation of the British Parliament. Throughout the nineteenth century, the term was combined with political notions and doctrines, thus producing the concepts of working class radicalism, middle class-, philosophic-, democratic- bourgeois-, Tory- and plebeian radicalism. In the event, politically influential radical leaders give rise to their own trend of political radicalism (see Spencean radicalism and Carlilean radicalism). Philosophically, the French political scientist Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778) is the principal theoretician proposing \"political radicalism\" as feasible in republican political philosophy, \"viz\" the French Revolution (1789–1799) and other modern revolutions—the antithesis to the liberalism of John Locke (1632–1704).\n\n"}

Even if not the work now at Detroit, this could have been the latter's prototype, since the painting is not unanimously attributed to van Eyck. There are indeed striking similarities between this work and Domenico Ghirlandaio's \"Saint Jerome in His Study\" (1480).\n\nThe painting depicts Saint Jerome in the traditional representation inside his study. He wears a cardinal's dress and hat, and is reading a book, in a small study clogged with numerous objects showing his erudition and interests. Below is a lion, recalling the saint's legend in which he had extracted a thorn from the paw of the animal, who had later remained loyal to him. The light enters from a window behind the writing desk and from the foreground, in order to illuminate any detail of the scene. Objects on the desk and the shelves include an hourglass, a pounce pot, a ruler, an astrolabe, numerous books and writing instruments, all suitable for the idealized man of the Renaissance.\n\n"}

{"id": "5161032", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5161032", "title": "Sole Survivor Policy", "text": "Sole Survivor Policy\n\nThe Sole Survivor Policy or DoD Directive 1315.15 \"Special Separation Policies for Survivorship\" describes a set of regulations in the Military of the United States that are designed to protect members of a family from the draft or from combat duty if they have already lost family members in military service.\n\nThe issue that gave rise to the regulations first caught public attention after the five Sullivan brothers were all killed when the USS \"Juneau\" (CL-52) was sunk during World War II. The policy was enacted as law in 1948. No nominally peacetime restriction was in place until 1964 during the Vietnam War; in 1971, Congress amended the law to include not only the sole surviving son or daughter, but also any son or daughter who had a combat-related death in the family. Since then, each branch of the military has made its own policies with regard to separating immediate family members.\n\nBefore the Sole Survivor Policy was officially implemented in 1948, several occasions occurred when sole survivors were excused from active service.\n\nIn World War II, the Borgstrom brothers, Elmer, Clyde, and twins Rolon and Rulon, were killed within a few months of each other in 1944. Their parents then successfully petitioned for their son Boyd, who was also on active duty, to be released from service. Their sixth son, Elton, who had not yet reached conscription age, was exempted from military service.\n\nThe three Butehorn brothers of Bethpage, New York, Charles, Joseph, and Henry, were all deployed during World War II. After Charles was killed in action in France in 1944 and Joseph was killed in action in the Pacific in 1945, Henry, who was serving with the Army Air Forces in Italy, was ordered home by the War Department. The \"Veterans of Foreign Wars\" post in Bethpage is named after their sacrifice.\n\nIn the case of the Niland brothers, U.S. intelligence believed that all but one of four siblings were killed in action. The eldest brother, Technical Sergeant Edward Niland, of the U.S. Army Air Forces, was later found to have been held in a prisoner of war camp in Burma. The academy-award winning film \"Saving Private Ryan\", directed by Steven Spielberg, was loosely based on the Niland brothers' story.\n\nBoth the Borgstrom and Butehorn incidents occurred before the Sole Survivor Policy was put into effect in 1948. They, along with the deaths of all of the Sullivan brothers in 1942, helped lead to it. \n\nJason and Nathan Hubbard joined the army after their brother Jared had died in Iraq in 2004. In 2007, Nathan died in a helicopter crash. Military officials ordered Jason home shortly after.\n\nJeremy, Ben, and Beau Wise served in active combat roles in the Afghan War. Jeremy, a former Navy SEAL, was at a CIA base as a military contractor and was killed in 2009 when a suicide bomber attacked the base. Later in 2011, Ben, an Army Special Forces combat medic, was seriously wounded in Afghanistan and died of his injuries at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center. Beau was deployed in Afghanistan with the Marines at that time and was immediately relieved of combat duties and returned to the United States.\n\nThis policy protects \"only sons/daughters\", \"the last son/daughter to carry the family name\", and \"sole surviving sons/daughters\" only during peacetime. In times of war or national emergency as declared by the US Congress, this provision does not apply to any of the above. Also, this provision is voluntary, meaning that the member wishing to be sent home has to request for the policy to be applied and get his application approved. Furthermore, it does not apply strictly to the sole surviving son but also to all surviving sons.\n\nMembers of the Armed Forces who are not eligible for Department of Defense Directive 1315.15, \"Special Separation Policies for Survivorship\", include those who currently have court-martial charges pending against them or those who have been convicted by court-martial. \n\nThe policy was changed to allow both enlisted and officers to apply for this discharge. If members of the Armed Forces re-enlist or voluntarily extend their active duty beyond the requirement after having been notified of a death in the family, those members automatically becomes ineligible.\n\n\n"}

All of the children were enrolled in Head Start classrooms in Lane County, Oregon, who were also participants in Project STAR a larger study conducted by the University of Oregon. The intervention included activities that targeted vocabulary, comprehension, and narrative ability. It was conducted for twenty minutes a day, approximately four days a week for eight weeks.\n\nThe trained teachers were instructed to read assigned storybooks to their classrooms for the allotted period of time. The storybooks used in the intervention were age appropriate, had numerous distinct sequence events, and varied vocabulary. Three vocabulary words were assigned per book to be introduced to the preschoolers that were related to the story and likely to be unfamiliar words. Some examples of selected words were ukulele, magician, optometrist, flashlight, crane, and restaurant. Activities were planned for all four days the book was assigned.\n\nOn the first day, children were introduced to the author, and had the opportunity to predict the events of the story based on the cover of the book. The teacher read the story, pausing to define assigned vocabulary words. At the conclusion of the story, the teachers asked comprehension questions.\n\nOn the second day, the teacher re-introduced the author and reminded the children of the three assigned vocabulary words. The teachers showed pictures of the vocabulary words and discussed broader categories that these words could fall into (e.g., \"elk\" falls into the category of \"animals\").\n\nOn the third day, students retold the story using the pictures in the book, and were encouraged to use the three vocabulary words while retelling the story. The teacher then asked review-oriented questions focusing on the vocabulary words.\n\nOn the final day, the children acted out events of the story beginning by stating the three vocabulary words. The children were assigned to play different roles of characters in the story.\n\nPreschoolers who participated in the intervention improved on measures of vocabulary and narrative ability. However, there were no significant gains in comprehension or Print Awareness. This study differed from previous studies in that it took place in a large group setting, to accommodate the resources available in typical Head Start programs, and in that teachers spent four days on one storybook. The study further supported that reading aloud to children may not be a sufficient practice to increase literacy skill.\n\n"}

She was awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature \"for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time\". She is the first writer from Belarus to receive the award.\n\nBorn in the west Ukrainian town of Stanislav (since 1962 Ivano-Frankivsk) to a Belarusian father and a Ukrainian mother, Svetlana Alexievich grew up in Belarus. After finishing school she worked as a reporter in several local newspapers before graduating from Belarusian State University (1972) and becoming a correspondent for the literary magazine \"Nyoman\" in Minsk (1976).\n\nDuring her career in journalism, Alexievich specialised in crafting narratives based on witness testimonies. In the process, she wrote oral histories of several dramatic events in Soviet history: the Second World War, the Afghan War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the Chernobyl disaster. After political persecution by the Lukashenko administration, she left Belarus in 2000. The International Cities of Refuge Network offered her sanctuary and during the following decade she lived in Paris, Gothenburg and Berlin. In 2011, Alexievich moved back to Minsk.\n\nAlexievich's books trace the emotional history of the Soviet and post-Soviet individual through carefully constructed collages of interviews. According to Russian writer and critic Dmitry Bykov, her books owe much to the ideas of Belarusian writer Ales Adamovich, who felt that the best way to describe the horrors of the 20th century was not by creating fiction but through recording the testimonies of witnesses. Belarusian poet Uladzimir Nyaklyayew called Adamovich \"her literary godfather\". He also named the documentary novel \"I'm from the Burned Village\" () by Ales Adamovich, Janka Bryl and Uladzimir Kalesnik, about the villages burned by the German troops during the occupation of Belarus, as the main single book that has influenced Alexievich's attitude to literature. Alexievich has confirmed the influence of Adamovich and Belarusian writer Vasil Bykaŭ, among others. She regards Varlam Shalamov as the best writer of the 20th century.\n\nHer most notable works in English translation include a collection of first-hand accounts from the war in Afghanistan (\"Zinky Boys: Soviet Voices from a Forgotten War\") and an oral history of the Chernobyl disaster (\"Chernobyl Prayer / Voices from Chernobyl\"). Alexievich describes the theme of her works this way:\n\nHer first book, \"War's Unwomanly Face\", came out in 1985. It was repeatedly reprinted and sold more than two million copies. The book was finished in 1983 and published (in short edition) in \"Oktyabr\", a Soviet monthly literary magazine, in February 1984. In 1985, the book was published by several publishers, and the number of printed copies reached 2,000,000 in the next five years. This novel is made up of monologues of women in the war speaking about the aspects of World War II that had never been related before. Another book, \"The Last Witnesses: the Book of Unchildlike Stories\", describes personal memories of children during wartime. The war seen through women's and children's eyes revealed a new world of feelings. In 1993, she published \"Enchanted with Death\", a book about attempted and completed suicides due to the downfall of the Soviet Union. Many people felt inseparable from the Communist ideology and unable to accept the new order surely and the newly interpreted history.\n\nHer books were not published by Belarusian state-owned publishing houses after 1993, while private publishers in Belarus have only published two of her books: \"Chernobyl Prayer\" in 1999 and \"Second-hand Time\" in 2013, both translated into Belarusian. As a result, Alexievich has been better known in the rest of world than in Belarus.\n\nShe has been described as the first journalist to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature. She herself rejects the notion that she is a journalist, and, in fact, what appears in her books as witnesses, are fiction and are changed between different editions of the same book.\n\nAlexievich has been awarded many awards, including:\n\nShe is a member of the advisory committee of the Lettre Ulysses Award.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57975", "title": "Time Team", "text": "Time Team\n\nTime Team is a British television programme that originally aired on Channel 4 from 16 January 1994 to 7 September 2014. Created by television producer Tim Taylor and presented by actor Tony Robinson, each episode featured a team of specialists carrying out an archaeological dig over a period of three days, with Robinson explaining the process in lay terms. The specialists changed throughout the programme's run, although it consistently included professional archaeologists such as Mick Aston, Carenza Lewis, Francis Pryor and Phil Harding. The sites excavated ranged in date from the Palaeolithic to the Second World War.\n\nIn October 2012, Channel 4 announced that the final series would be broadcast in 2013. Series 20 was screened from January–March 2013 and nine specials were screened between May 2013 and September 2014.\n\nAt the start of the programme, Tony Robinson explains, in an opening \"piece to camera\", the reasons for the team's visit to the site and during the dig, he enthusiastically encourages the archaeologists to explain their decisions, discoveries and conclusions. He tries to ensure that everything is comprehensible to the archaeologically uninitiated. The site is frequently suggested by a member of the viewing public. \"Time Team\" uncover as much as they can of the archaeology and history of the site in three days.\n\nExcavations are not just carried out to entertain viewers. Tony Robinson claims that the archaeologists involved with \"Time Team\" have published more scientific papers on excavations carried out in the programme than all British university archaeology departments over the same period and that by 2013, the programme had become the biggest funder of field archaeology in the country.\n\nA team of archaeologists, usually led by Mick Aston or Francis Pryor (the latter usually heading Bronze Age and Iron Age digs), including field archaeologist Phil Harding, congregate at a site, usually in Britain. The original \"Time Team\" line-up from 1994 has altered over the years. Historian Robin Bush was a regular in the first nine series, having been involved with the programme through his long friendship with Mick Aston. Architectural historian Beric Morley featured in ten episodes between 1995 and 2002. In 2005, Carenza Lewis left to pursue other interests. She was replaced by Helen Geake, Anglo-Saxon specialist. The regular team also included: Stewart Ainsworth, landscape investigator; John Gater and Chris Gaffney, archaeological geophysicists; Henry Chapman, surveyor; Victor Ambrus, illustrator; and Robin Bush, archivist\n\nThe team was supplemented by experts appropriate for the period and type of site. Guy de la Bédoyère has often been present for Roman digs, as well as those involving the Second World War such as D-Day and aircraft (such as the Spitfire). Architectural historian Jonathan Foyle has appeared in episodes relating to excavations of country estates. Paul Blinkhorn (pottery), Mark Corney (coins) and Jackie McKinley (bones) have appeared from time to time. Mick ‘the dig’ Worthington, an excavator in the early series, occasionally returned as a dendrochronologist, whereupon he was dubbed 'Mick the twig'. Margaret Cox often assisted with forensic archaeology, mainly between 1998 and 2005. Other specialists who appeared from time to time include historian Bettany Hughes, archaeologist Gustav Milne, East of England specialist Ben Robinson and David S. Neal, expert on Roman mosaics. Local historians also joined in when appropriate.\n\nIn February 2012, it was announced that Aston had quit the show due to format changes. The disputed changes included hiring anthropologist Mary-Ann Ochota as a co-presenter, dispensing with other archaeologists and what he thought were plans to \"cut down the informative stuff about the archaeology\". \"The time had come to leave. I never made any money out of it, but a lot of my soul went into it. I feel really, really angry about it.\" he told \"British Archaeology\" magazine. \"Time Team\" producer Tim Taylor released a statement in response to the news reports saying \"His concerns are of great importance to me. We have addressed some of them\" and that \"you’ve not heard the last of Mick on \"Time Team\"\".\n\nMore recent regular team members included archaeologist Neil Holbrook, Roman coins specialist Philippa Walton, and historian Sam Newton. Younger members of \"Time Team\" who made regular appearances include: Jenni Butterworth; Raksha Dave; Kerry Ely; Brigid Gallagher; Rob Hedge; Katie Hirst; Alex Langlands; Cassie Newland; Ian Powlesland; Alice Roberts; Faye Simpson ; Barney Sloane; Tracey Smith; and Matt Williams.\n\n\"Time Team\" developed from an earlier Channel 4 programme, \"Time Signs\", first broadcast in 1991. Produced by Taylor, \"Time Signs\" had featured Aston and Harding, who went on to appear on \"Time Team\". Following that show's cancellation, Taylor went on to develop a more attractive format, producing the idea for \"Time Team\", which Channel 4 also picked up, broadcasting the first series in 1994. \"Time Team\" has had many companion shows during its run, including \"Time Team Extra\" (1998), \"History Hunters\" (1998–1999) and \"Time Team Digs\" (1997–2006), whilst several spin-off books have been published. The programme features special episodes, often documentaries on history or archaeology and live episodes. \"Time Team America\", a US version of the programme, was broadcast on PBS in 2009 and co-produced by Oregon Public Broadcasting and Videotext/C4i. The programme has been exported to 35 other countries.\n\n\"Time Team\" was commissioned by Channel 4 Television (the broadcaster) and made in partnership between VideoText Communications Ltd and Picturehouse Television Co. Ltd (based in London). Recently formed Wildfire Television was involved in the production of \"The Big Roman Dig\" (2005) and \"The Big Royal Dig\" (2006). It was produced by Tim Taylor, the show's originator, with Associate Producer Tony Robinson.\n\nOn 13 September 2007, during the filming of a jousting reenactment for a special episode of \"Time Team\", a splinter from a balsa wood lance went through the eye-slit in the helmet of one of the participants and entered his eye socket. 54-year-old Paul Anthony Allen, a member of a re-enactment society, died a week later in hospital. Channel 4 stated that the programme would be shown, but without the re-enactment sequence. The episode, dedicated to Mr Allen, was transmitted on 25 February 2008.\n\nIn 2012 Mick Aston announced he was leaving the show criticising format changes that focused less on archaeological activities. Channel 4 subsequently announced that the final \"Time Team\" series would be broadcast in 2013. Viewing figures had been in decline from 2.5 million in 2008 to 1.5 million watching a special called \"Brunel's Last Launch\" in November 2011.\nIn October 2013 Tony Robinson said in an interview with \"Radio Times\" that he believed \"Time Team\" still had life in it and suggested that after a three- or four-year absence it could make a return. He also expressed support for a fan-organised Facebook campaign to bring the \"Time Team\" crew together again to carry out a dig in memory of Aston, who died suddenly on 24 June 2013. The regular \"Time Team\" programme ended on 24 March 2013; the final \"Time Team\" special aired on 7 September 2014.\n\n\"Time Team's Big Dig\" was an expansion on the live format. A weekend of live broadcasts in June 2003 was preceded by a week of daily short programmes. It involved about a thousand members of the public in excavating test pits each one metre square by fifty centimetres deep. Most of these pits were in private gardens and the project stirred up controversies about approaches to public archaeology.\n\n\"Time Team's Big Roman Dig\" (2005) saw this format altered, in an attempt to avoid previous controversies, through the coverage of nine archaeological sites around the UK which were already under investigation by professional archaeologists. \"Time Team\" covered the action through live link-ups based at a Roman Villa at Dinnington in Somerset - itself a \"Time Team\" excavation from 2003. Over 60 other professionally supervised excavations were supported by \"Time Team\" and carried out around the country in association with the programme. A further hundred activities relating to Roman history were carried out by schools and other institutions around the UK.\n\n\"Time Team Specials\" are documentary programmes about topics in history and archaeology made by the same production company. They are generally presented by Tony Robinson and often feature one or more of the familiar faces from the regular programme of \"Time Team\". In some cases the programme makers have followed the process of discovery at a large commercial or research excavation by another body, such as that to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the ending of the First World War at the Vampire dugout in Belgium. \"Time Team\" usually does not carry out excavations for these programmes, but may contribute a reconstruction.\n\n\"Time Team History of Britain\" saw Robinson and the team document everything they have learned up to now and show a history of Britain. \"Behind the Scenes of Time Team\" showed meetings of the archaeologists, and material not transmitted during the episode of the dig. \"10 Years of Time Team\" presented a round-up of what has happened in Time Team over the past 10 years and what they expect to happen in the future.\n\n\"Time Team\" has been credited with promoting archaeology in the UK. In a 2008 report produced by English Heritage, a working group of Palaeolithic specialists recognised the importance of the show in \"promoting public awareness\" of Palaeolithic Britain, something which they argued was to be encouraged.\nComplete series have been released in Australia starting with Series 15 in 2010. Since then, Series 12 (2014), Series 14 (2012), Series 16 (2010), Series 17 (2011), Series 18 (2012), Series 19 (2012) and Series 20 (2013) have all been released in Australia. 'Best Of' DVDs were released in the UK over the years; however, a complete series had never been released until Series 18 was released by Acorn Media UK on 6 February 2012. On 15 May 2012, Acorn Media released a collection of Roman themed episodes on Region One DVD.\n\n\n"}

They had their origin in religious symbolism.\n\nIn the Avestan literature and Iranian mythology, there are several sacred vegetal icons related to life, eternality and cure, like: Amesha Spenta Amordad (guardian of plants, goddess of trees and immortality), Gaokerena (or white Haoma, a tree that its vivacity would certify continuance of life in universe), Bas tokhmak (a tree with remedial attribute, retentive of all herbal seeds, and destroyer of sorrow), Mashyа and Mashyane (parents of the human race in Iranian myths), Barsom (copped offshoots of pomegranate, gaz or Haoma that Zoroastrians use in their rituals), Haoma (a plant, unknown today, that was source of sacred potable), etc.\n\nGaokerena is a large, sacred Haoma planted by Ahura Mazda. Ahriman (Ahreman, Angremainyu) created a frog to invade the tree and destroy it, aiming to prevent all trees from growing on the earth. As a reaction, Ahura Mazda created two kar fish staring at the frog to guard the tree. The two fish are always staring at the frog and stay ready to react to it. Because Ahriman is responsible for all evil including death, while Ahura Mazda is responsible for all good (including life).\n\nhaoma is another sacred plant due to the drink made from it. The preparation of the drink from the plant by pounding and the drinking of it are central features of Zoroastrian ritual. Haoma is also personified as a divinity. It bestows essential vital qualities—health, fertility, husbands for maidens, even immortality. The source of the earthly haoma plant is a shining white tree that grows on a paradisiacal mountain. Sprigs of this white haoma were brought to earth by divine birds.\n\nHaoma is the Avestan form of the Sanskrit \"soma\". The near identity of the two in ritual significance is considered by scholars to point to a salient feature of an Indo-Iranian religion antedating Zoroastrianism.\n\nAnother related issue in ancient mythology of Iran is the myth of Mashyа and Mashyane, two trees who were the ancestors of all living beings. This myth can be considered as a prototype for the creation myth where living beings are created by Gods (who have a human form).\n\nThe Assyrian tree of life was represented by a series of nodes and criss-crossing lines. It was apparently an important religious symbol, often attended to in Assyrian palace reliefs by human or eagle-headed winged genies, or the King, and blessed or fertilized with bucket and cone. Assyriologists have not reached consensus as to the meaning of this symbol. The name \"Tree of Life\" has been attributed to it by modern scholarship; it is not used in the Assyrian sources. In fact, no textual evidence pertaining to the symbol is known to exist.\nThe \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" is a similar quest for immortality. In Mesopotamian mythology, Etana searches for a 'plant of birth' to provide him with a son. This has a solid provenance of antiquity, being found in cylinder seals from Akkad (2390–2249 BCE).\n\nIn ancient Urartu, the tree of life was a religious symbol and was drawn on walls of fortresses and carved on the armor of warriors. The branches of the tree were equally divided on the right and left sides of the stem, with each branch having one leaf, and one leaf on the apex of the tree. Servants stood on each side of the tree with one of their hands up as if they are taking care of the tree.\n\nThe concept of the tree of life appears in the writings of the Bahá'í Faith, where it can refer to the Manifestation of God, a great teacher who appears to humanity from age to age. An example of this can be found in the \"Hidden Words\" of Bahá'u'lláh:\n\nAlso, in the \"Tablet of Ahmad\" of Bahá'u'lláh: \"Verily He is the Tree of Life, that bringeth forth the fruits of God, the Exalted, the Powerful, the Great\".\n\nBahá'u'lláh refers to his male descendants as branches ( \"ʾaghṣān\") and calls women leaves.\n\nA distinction has been made between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. The latter represents the physical world with its opposites, such as good and evil and light and dark. In a different context from the one above, the tree of life represents the spiritual realm, where this duality does not exist.\n\nThe \"Bo\" tree, also called \"Bodhi\" tree, according to Buddhist tradition, is the pipal (Ficus religiosa) under which the Buddha sat when he attained Enlightenment (Bodhi) at Bodh Gaya (near Gaya, west-central Bihar state, India). A living pipal at Anuradhapura, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), is said to have grown from a cutting from the Bo tree sent to that city by King Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE.\n\nAccording to Tibetan tradition when Buddha went to the holy Lake Manasorovar along with 500 monks, he took with him the energy of Prayaga Raj. Upon his arrival, he installed the energy of Prayaga Raj near Lake Manasorovar, at a place now known as Prayang. Then he planted the seed of this eternal banyan tree next to Mt. Kailash on a mountain known as the \"Palace of Medicine Buddha\".\n\nIn Chinese mythology, a carving of a tree of life depicts a phoenix and a dragon; the dragon often represents immortality. A Taoist story tells of a tree that produces a peach of immortality every three thousand years, and anyone who eats the fruit receives immortality.\n\nAn archaeological discovery in the 1990s was of a sacrificial pit at Sanxingdui in Sichuan, China. Dating from about 1200 BCE, it contained three bronze trees, one of them 4 meters high. At the base was a dragon, and fruit hanging from the lower branches. At the top is a bird-like (Phoenix) creature with claws. Also found in Sichuan, from the late Han dynasty (c 25 – 220 CE), is another tree of life. The ceramic base is guarded by a horned beast with wings. The leaves of the tree represent coins and people. At the apex is a bird with coins and the Sun.\n\nThe tree of life first appears in Genesis 2:9 and 3:22-24 as the source of eternal life in the Garden of Eden, from which access is revoked when man is driven from the garden. It then reappears in the last book of the Bible, the Book of Revelation, and most predominantly in the last chapter of that book (Chapter 22) as a part of the new garden of paradise. Access is then no longer forbidden, for those who \"wash their robes\" (or as the textual variant in the King James Version has it, \"they that do his commandments\") \"have right to the tree of life\" (v.14). A similar statement appears in Rev 2:7, where the tree of life is promised as a reward to those who overcome. Revelation 22 begins with a reference to the \"pure river of water of life\" which proceeds \"out of the throne of God\". The river seems to feed two trees of life, one \"on either side of the river\" which \"bear twelve manner of fruits\" \"and the leaves of the tree were for healing of the nations\" (v.1-2). Or this may indicate that the tree of life is a vine that grows on both sides of the river, as John 15:1 would hint at.\n\nPope Benedict XVI has said that \"the Cross is the true tree of life.\" Saint Bonaventure taught that the medicinal fruit of the tree of life is Christ himself. Saint Albert the Great taught that the Eucharist, the Body and Blood of Christ, is the Fruit of the Tree of Life. Augustine of Hippo said that the tree of life is Christ:\nIn Eastern Christianity the tree of life is the love of God.\n\nThe tree of life vision is a vision described and discussed in the Book of Mormon. According to the Book of Mormon, the vision was received in a dream by the prophet Lehi, and later in vision by his son Nephi, who wrote about it in the First Book of Nephi. The vision includes a path leading to a tree symbolizing salvation, with an iron rod along the path whereby followers of Jesus may hold to the rod and avoid wandering off the path into pits or waters symbolizing the ways of sin. The vision also includes a large building wherein the wicked look down at the righteous and mock them.\n\nThe vision is said to symbolize the spiritual plight of humanity and is a well known and cited story within Mormonism. A Mormon commentator reflected a common Mormon belief that the vision is \"one of the richest, most flexible, and far-reaching pieces of symbolic prophecy contained in the standard works [scriptures].\"\n\nIn \"Dictionnaire Mytho-Hermetique\" (Paris, 1737), Antoine-Joseph Pernety, a famous alchemist, identified the tree of life with the Elixir of life and the Philosopher's Stone.\n\nIn \"Eden in the East\" (1998), Stephen Oppenheimer suggests that a tree-worshipping culture arose in Indonesia and was diffused by the so-called \"Younger Dryas\" event of c. 10,900 BCE or 12,900 BP, after which the sea level rose. This culture reached China (Szechuan), then India and the Middle East. Finally the Finno-Ugric strand of this diffusion spread through Russia to Finland where the Norse myth of Yggdrasil took root.\n\nThe Borjgali () is an ancient Georgian tree of life symbol.\n\nIn Germanic paganism, trees played (and, in the form of reconstructive Heathenry and Germanic Neopaganism, continue to play) a prominent role, appearing in various aspects of surviving texts and possibly in the name of gods.\n\nThe tree of life appears in Norse religion as \"Yggdrasil\", the world tree, a massive tree (sometimes considered a yew or ash tree) with extensive lore surrounding it. Perhaps related to Yggdrasil, accounts have survived of Germanic Tribes' honouring sacred trees within their societies. Examples include Thor's Oak, sacred groves, the Sacred tree at Uppsala, and the wooden Irminsul pillar. In Norse Mythology, the apples from Iðunn's ash box provide immortality for the gods.\n\nThe \"Tree of Immortality\" (Arabic: شجرة الخلود) is the tree of life motif as it appears in the Quran. It is also alluded to in hadiths and tafsir. Unlike the biblical account, the Quran mentions only one tree in Eden, also called the tree of immortality, which Allah specifically forbade to Adam and Eve. Satan repeatedly told Adam to eat from the tree, and eventually both Adam and Eve did so, thus disobeying Allah. The hadiths also speak about other trees in heaven.\n\nAccording to the Indian Ahmadiyya movement founded in 1889, Quranic reference to the tree is symbolic; eating of the forbidden tree signifies that Adam disobeyed God.\n\n\"Etz Chaim\", Hebrew for \"tree of life,\" is a common term used in Judaism. The expression, found in the Book of Proverbs, is figuratively applied to the Torah itself. \"Etz Chaim\" is also a common name for yeshivas and synagogues as well as for works of Rabbinic literature. It is also used to describe each of the wooden poles to which the parchment of a Sefer Torah is attached.\n\nThe tree of life is mentioned in the Book of Genesis; it is distinct from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. After Adam and Eve disobeyed God by eating fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, they were driven out of the Garden of Eden. Remaining in the garden, however, was the tree of life. To prevent their access to this tree in the future, Cherubim with a flaming sword were placed at the east of the garden. ()\n\nIn the Book of Proverbs, the tree of life is associated with wisdom: \"[Wisdom] is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her, and happy \"[is every one]\" that retaineth her.\" () In the tree of life is associated with calmness: \"A soothing tongue is a tree of life; but perverseness therein is a wound to the spirit.\"\n\nThe Book of Enoch, generally considered non-canonical, states that in the time of the great judgment God will give all those whose names are in the Book of Life fruit to eat from the tree of life.\n\nJewish mysticism depicts the tree of life in the form of ten interconnected nodes, as the central symbol of the Kabbalah. It comprises the ten \"Sefirot\" powers in the divine realm. The panentheistic and anthropomorphic emphasis of this emanationist theology interpreted the Torah, Jewish observance, and the purpose of Creation as the symbolic esoteric drama of unification in the \"Sefirot\", restoring harmony to Creation. From the time of the Renaissance onwards, Jewish Kabbalah became incorporated as an important tradition in non-Jewish Western culture, first through its adoption by Christian Kabbalah, and continuing in Western esotericism occult Hermetic Qabalah. These adapted the Judaic Kabbalah tree of life syncretically by associating it with other religious traditions, esoteric theologies, and magical practices.\n\nThe concept of world trees is a prevalent motif in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cosmologies and iconography. World trees embodied the four cardinal directions, which represented also the fourfold nature of a central world tree, a symbolic \"axis mundi\" connecting the planes of the Underworld and the sky with that of the terrestrial world.\n\nDepictions of world trees, both in their directional and central aspects, are found in the art and mythological traditions of cultures such as the Maya, Aztec, Izapan, Mixtec, Olmec, and others, dating to at least the Mid/Late Formative periods of Mesoamerican chronology. Among the Maya, the central world tree was conceived as or represented by a \"ceiba\" tree, and is known variously as a \"wacah chan\" or \"yax imix che\", depending on the Mayan language. The trunk of the tree could also be represented by an upright caiman, whose skin evokes the tree's spiny trunk.\n\nDirectional world trees are also associated with the four Yearbearers in Mesoamerican calendars, and the directional colors and deities. Mesoamerican codices which have this association outlined include the Dresden, Borgia and Fejérváry-Mayer codices. It is supposed that Mesoamerican sites and ceremonial centers frequently had actual trees planted at each of the four cardinal directions, representing the quadripartite concept.\n\nWorld trees are frequently depicted with birds in their branches, and their roots extending into earth or water (sometimes atop a \"water-monster,\" symbolic of the underworld). The central world tree has also been interpreted as a representation of the band of the Milky Way.\n\nIn a myth passed down among the Iroquois, \"The World on the Turtle's Back\", explains the origin of the land in which a tree of life is described. According to the myth, it is found in the heavens, where the first humans lived, until a pregnant woman fell and landed in an endless sea. Saved by a giant turtle from drowning, she formed the world on its back by planting bark taken from the tree.\n\nThe tree of life motif is present in the traditional Ojibway cosmology and traditions. It is sometimes described as Grandmother Cedar, or \"Nookomis Giizhig\" in Anishinaabemowin.\n\nIn the book Black Elk Speaks, Black Elk, an Oglala Lakota (Sioux) \"wičháša wakȟáŋ\" (medicine man and holy man), describes his vision in which after dancing around a dying tree that has never bloomed he is transported to the other world (spirit world) where he meets wise elders, 12 men and 12 women. The elders tell Black Elk that they will bring him to meet \"Our Father, the two-legged chief\" and bring him to the center of a hoop where he sees the tree in full leaf and bloom and the \"chief\" standing against the tree. Coming out of his trance he hopes to see that the earthly tree has bloomed, but it is dead.\n\nIn Serer religion, the tree of life as a religious concept forms the basis of Serer cosmogony. Trees were the first things created on Earth by the supreme being Roog (or Koox among the Cangin). In the competing versions of the Serer creation myth, the \"Somb\" (\"Prosopis africana\") and the \"Saas\" tree (acacia albida) are both viewed as trees of life. However, the prevailing view is that, the \"Somb\" was the first tree on Earth and the progenitor of plant life. The \"Somb\" was also used in the Serer tumuli and burial chambers, many of which had survived for more than a thousand years. Thus, \"Somb\" is not only the tree of life in Serer society, but the symbol of immortality.\n\nThe World Tree or tree of life is a central symbol in Turkic mythology. It is a common motif in carpets. In 2009 it was introduced as the main design of the common Turkish lira sub-unit 5 kuruş.\n\nIn the sacred books of Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma), Puranas mention divine tree Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). This divine tree is guarded by Gandharvas in the garden of Amaravati, city under the control of Indra, King of gods. Popular story goes like this, for a very long time, gods and demi-gods who are believed to be fathered by Kashyapa Prajapati and have different mothers. After a long time frequent battles between the two half-brother clans, both groups decided to churn the milky ocean to obtain Amrutam (అమృతం, अमृत ) and share equally. During the churning, along with many other mythical items emerged the Kalpavruksham (కల్పవృక్షం, कल्पवृक्ष ). It is gold in colour. It has mesmerizing aura. It can be pleased with chanting and offers. When it is pleased, it grants every wish. \n\nAustrian symbolist artist Gustav Klimt portrayed his version of the tree of life in his painting, \"The Tree of Life, Stoclet Frieze\". This iconic painting later inspired the external facade of the \"New Residence Hall\" (also called the \"Tree House\"), a colorful 21-story student residence hall at Massachusetts College of Art and Design in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nIn George Herbert's poem \"\" (part of \"The Temple\", 1633), the tree of life is the rood on which Jesus Christ was crucified. In C. S. Lewis' \"Chronicles of Narnia\", the tree of life plays a role, especially in the sixth published book (the first in the in-world chronology) \"The Magician's Nephew\".\n\nAlex Proyas' 2009 film \"Knowing\" ends with the two young protagonists directed towards the tree of life.\n\nIn season 13 of the TV series \"Supernatural\", fruit from the tree of life is an important ingredient in a spell to open a portal to an alternate reality. The angel Castiel is able to find the tree in Syria and returns from a mission with the fruit in \"Scoobynatural\". The fruit is used in subsequent episodes as part of the spell to open the portal between the worlds.\n\n\n"}

At its largest extent the site covered some 21.85 km, and its political influence extended over an area of more than 25,000 km² of the neighbouring territory.\n\nIts name in Mixtecan languages was \"Yucu Dzaa\".\n\nToday, the site is occupied by the contemporary settlement of Villa de Tututepec de Melchor Ocampo, in the Mexican state of Oaxaca.\n\n"}

{"id": "74661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74661", "title": "Veto", "text": "Veto\n\nA veto – Latin for \"I forbid\" – is the power (used by an officer of the state, for example) to unilaterally stop an official action, especially the enactment of legislation. A veto can be absolute, as for instance in the United Nations Security Council, whose permanent members (China, France, Russia, United Kingdom, and the United States of America) can block any resolution, or it can be limited, as in the legislative process of the United States, where a two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate may override a Presidential veto of legislation. A veto may give power only to stop changes (thus allowing its holder to protect the status quo), like the US legislative veto mentioned before, or to also adopt them (an \"amendatory veto\"), like the legislative veto of the Indian President, which allows him to propose amendments to bills returned to the Parliament for reconsideration.\n\nThe concept of a veto body originated with the Roman consuls and tribunes. Either of the two consuls holding office in a given year could block a military or civil decision by the other; any tribune had the power to unilaterally block legislation passed by the Roman Senate.\n\nThe institution of the veto, known to the Romans as the \"intercessio\", was adopted by the Roman Republic in the 6th century BC to enable the tribunes to protect the mandamus interests of the plebs (common citizenry) from the encroachments of the patricians, who dominated the Senate. A tribune's veto did not prevent the senate from passing a bill, but meant that it was denied the force of law. The tribunes could also use the veto to prevent a bill from being brought before the plebeian assembly. The consuls also had the power of veto, as decision-making generally required the assent of both consuls. If one disagreed, either could invoke the \"intercessio\" to block the action of the other. The veto was an essential component of the Roman conception of power being wielded not only to manage state affairs but to moderate and restrict the power of the state's high officials and institutions.\n\nIn Westminster systems and most constitutional monarchies, the power to veto legislation by withholding the Royal Assent is a rarely used reserve power of the monarch. In practice, the Crown follows the convention of exercising its prerogative on the advice of its chief advisor, the prime minister.\n\nSince the Statute of Westminster (1931), the United Kingdom Parliament may not repeal any Act of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia on the grounds that is repugnant to the laws and interests of the United Kingdom. Other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations (not to be confused with the Commonwealth of Australia), such as Canada and New Zealand, are likewise affected. However, according to the Australian Constitution (sec. 59), the Queen may veto a bill that has been given royal assent by the Governor-General within one year of the legislation being assented to. This power has never been used. The Australian Governor-General himself or herself has, in theory, power to veto, or more technically, withhold assent to, a bill passed by both houses of the Australian Parliament, and contrary to the advice of the prime minister. This may be done without consulting the sovereign as per Section 58 of the constitution:\n\nWhen a proposed law passed by both Houses of the Parliament is presented to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent, he shall declare, according to his discretion, but subject to this Constitution, that he assents in the Queen's name, or that he withholds assent, or that he reserves the law for the Queen's pleasure. The Governor-General may return to the house in which it originated any proposed law so presented to him, and may transmit therewith any amendments which he may recommend, and the Houses may deal with the recommendation.\n\nThis reserve power is however, constitutionally arguable, and it is difficult to foresee an occasion when such a power would need to be exercised. It is possible that a Governor-general might so act if a bill passed by the Parliament was in violation of the Constitution. One might argue, however, that a government would be hardly likely to present a bill which is so open to rejection. Many of the viceregal reserve powers are untested, because of the brief constitutional history of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the observance of the convention that the head of state acts upon the advice of his or her chief minister. The power may also be used in a situation where the parliament, usually a hung parliament, passes a bill without the blessing of the executive. The governor general on the advice of the executive could withhold consent from the bill thereby preventing its passage into law.\n\nWith regard to the six governors of the states which are federated under the Australian Commonwealth, a somewhat different situation exists. Until the Australia Act 1986, each state was constitutionally dependent upon the British Crown directly. Since 1986, however, they are fully independent entities, although the Queen still appoints governors on the advice of the state head of government, the premier. So the Crown may not veto (nor the UK Parliament overturn) any act of a state governor or state legislature. Paradoxically, the states are more independent of the Crown than the federal government and legislature. State constitutions determine what role a governor plays. In general the governor exercises the powers the sovereign would have, including the power to withhold the Royal Assent.\n\nAccording to the Constitution Act, 1867, the Queen in Counsel (in practice the Cabinet of the United Kingdom) may instruct the Governor General to withhold the Queen's assent, allowing the sovereign two years to disallow the bill, thereby vetoing the law in question. This was last used in 1873, and the power was effectively nullified by the Balfour Declaration of 1926.\n\nProvincial viceroys, called \"Lieutenant Governors\" (plural) are able to reserve Royal Assent to provincial bills for consideration and possible disallowance by the Federal Cabinet; this clause was last invoked in 1961 by the Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan.\n\nIn India, the president has three veto powers, i.e. absolute, suspension & pocket. The president can send the bill back to parliament for changes, which constitutes a limited veto that can be overridden by a simple majority. But the Bill reconsidered by the parliament becomes a law with or without the assents of President after 14 days. The president can also take no action indefinitely on a bill, sometimes referred to as a pocket veto. The president can refuse to assent, which constitutes an absolute veto.\n\nIn Spain, Section 91 of the Constitution provides that the King shall give his assent to laws passed by the General Courts within 15 days after their final passing by them. The absence of the royal assent, although not constitutionally provided, would mean the bill did not become a part of the law. \nSection 90 of the Constitution states that \"Within two months after receiving the text, the Senate may, by a message stating the reasons for it, adopt a veto or approve amendments thereto. The veto must be adopted by overall majority.\"\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the royal veto (\"withholding Royal Assent\") was last exercised in 1708 by Queen Anne with the Scottish Militia Bill 1708.\n\nThe House of Lords used to have an effective power of veto by refusing to concur in bills adopted by the House of Commons. However, reform first by a Liberal government and then by a Labour government has limited its powers. The Parliament Acts of 1911 and 1949 reduced its powers: they can now only amend and delay legislation. They can delay legislation for up to one year. Under the 1911 Act, money bills (those concerning finance) cannot be delayed, and under the Salisbury Convention, the Lords, by convention, cannot delay any bills set out in the governing party's manifesto.\n\nAll legislation passed by both houses of Congress must be presented to the President. This presentation is in the President's capacity as Head of Government.\n\nIf the President approves of the legislation, then the President signs it into law. According to of the Constitution, when the President chooses not to sign or does not approve of the bill, the President must return the bill, unsigned, within ten days, excluding Sundays, to the house of the United States Congress in which it originated, while the Congress is in session. The President is constitutionally required to state any objections to the bill in writing, and the Congress is constitutionally required to consider them, and to reconsider the legislation. This action, in effect, is a veto.\n\nIf the Congress overrides the veto by a two-thirds vote in each house, it becomes law without the President's signature. Otherwise, the bill fails to become law unless it is presented to the President again and the President chooses to sign it. Historically, the Congress overrides the Presidential veto 7% of the time.\n\nA bill can also become law without the President's signature if, after its presentment, the President simply fails to sign it within the ten days noted. If there are fewer than ten days left in the session before Congress adjourns, and if Congress does so adjourn before the ten days have expired in which the President might sign the bill, then the bill fails to become law. This procedure, when used as a formal device, is called a pocket veto.\n\nIn 1983, the Supreme Court had struck down the one-house legislative veto, on separation of powers grounds and on grounds that the action by one house of Congress violated the Constitutional requirement of bicameralism. The case was \"INS v. Chadha\", concerning a foreign exchange student in Ohio who had been born in Kenya but whose parents were from India. Because he was not born in India, he was not an Indian citizen. Because his parents were not Kenyan citizens, he was not Kenyan. Thus, he had nowhere to go when his student visa expired because neither country would take him, so he overstayed his visa and was ordered to show cause why he should not be deported from the United States.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act was one of many acts of Congress passed since the 1930s, which contained a provision allowing either house of that legislature to nullify decisions of agencies in the executive branch simply by passing a resolution. In this case, Chadha's deportation was suspended and the House of Representatives passed a resolution overturning the suspension, so that the deportation proceedings would continue. This, the Court held, amounted to the House of Representatives passing legislation without the concurrence of the Senate, and without presenting the legislation to the President for consideration and approval (or veto). Thus, the Constitutional principle of bicameralism and the separation of powers doctrine were disregarded in this case, and this legislative veto of executive decisions was struck down.\n\nIn 1996, the United States Congress passed, and President Bill Clinton signed, the Line Item Veto Act of 1996. This act allowed the President to veto individual items of budgeted expenditures from appropriations bills instead of vetoing the entire bill and sending it back to the Congress. However, this line-item veto was immediately challenged by members of Congress who disagreed with it. In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to declare the line-item veto unconstitutional. In \"Clinton v. City of New York\" (), the Court found the language of the Constitution required each bill presented to the President to be either approved or rejected as a whole. An action by which the President might pick and choose which parts of the bill to approve or not approve amounted to the President acting as a legislator instead of an executive and head of state—and particularly as a single legislator acting in place of the entire Congress—thereby violating the separation of powers doctrine. Prior to being declared unconstitutional, President Clinton had applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.\n\nIn 2006, Senator Bill Frist introduced the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 in the United States Senate. Rather than provide for an actual legislative veto, however, the procedure created by the Act provides that, if the President should recommend rescission of a budgetary line item from a budget bill he previously signed into law—a power he already possesses pursuant to U.S. Const. Article II—the Congress must vote on his request within ten days. Because the legislation that is the subject of the President's request (or \"Special Message\", in the language of the bill) was already enacted and signed into law, the vote by the Congress would be ordinary legislative action, not any kind of veto—whether line-item, legislative or any other sort. The House passed this measure, but the Senate never considered it, so the bill expired and never became law.\n\nIn 2009, Senators Russ Feingold and John McCain introduced legislation of a limited version of the line-item veto. This bill would give the president the power to withdraw earmarks in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus the line-item vetoed earmark. Congress would then vote on the line-item vetoed bill with a majority vote under fast track rules to make any deadlines the bill had.\n\nDuring the Constitutional Convention, the veto was routinely referred to as a 'revisionary power'.\n\nThe Veto was constructed not as an absolute veto, but rather with limits, such as that Congress can override a veto, and that the President's objections must be stated in writing. These limits would have been important in the minds of the Founders, given that in Britain the monarch retained an absolute veto (though by this time the power had become a formality). Further, as Elbridge Gerry explained in the final days of the Convention: \"The primary object of the revisionary check of the President is not to protect the general interest, but to defend his own department.\"\n\nDuring the Constitutional Convention the framers overwhelmingly rejected three proposals for an absolute veto.\n\nThe Presidents of the Continental Congress (1774–81) did not have the power of veto. The President could not veto an act of Congress under the Articles of Confederation (1781–89), but he possessed certain recess and reserve powers that were not necessarily available to the predecessor President of the Continental Congress. It was only with the enactment of the United States Constitution (drafted 1787; ratified 1788; fully effective since 4 March 1789) that veto power was conferred upon the person titled \"President of the United States\".\n\nThe presidential veto power was first exercised on 5 April 1792 when President George Washington vetoed a bill outlining a new apportionment formula. Apportionment described how Congress divides seats in the House of Representatives among the states based on the US census figures. President Washington's stated reasons for vetoing the bill were (1) that it did not apportion representatives according to states' relative populations and (2) that it gave eight states more than 1 representative per 30,000 residents, in violation of the Constitution.\n\nThe Congress first overrode a presidential veto (passed a bill into law notwithstanding the President's objections) on 3 March 1845.\n\nAll U.S. states also have a provision by which legislative decisions can be vetoed by the governor. In addition to the ability to veto an entire bill as a \"package,\" many states allow the governor to exercise specialty veto authority to strike or revise portions of a bill without striking the whole bill.\n\n\nMany European republics allow some form of presidential veto on legislation, which may vary, according to their constitutional form or by convention. These include France, Italy, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, and Hungary.\n\nThe President of Austria has no veto power, but signs bills into law.\n\nThe President of Iceland may refuse to sign a bill, which is then put to referendum. This right was not exercised until 2004, by President Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, who has since refused to sign two other bills. The first bill was withdrawn, but the latter two resulted in referenda.\n\nThe President of France has only a very limited form of suspensive veto: when presented with a law, he or she can request another reading of it by the Assembly, but only once per law. Aside from it, the President can only refer bills to the Constitutional Council.\n\nThe President of Hungary has two options to veto a bill: submit it to the Constitutional Court if he suspects that it violates the constitution or send it back to the Parliament and ask for a second debate and vote on the bill. If the Court rules that the bill is constitutional or it is passed by the Parliament again, respectively, the President must sign it.\n\nThe President of Ireland may refuse to grant assent to a bill that he or she considers to be unconstitutional, after consulting the Council of State; in this case, the bill is referred to the Supreme Court, which finally determines the matter. This is the most widely used reserve power. The President may also, on request of a majority of Seanad Éireann (the upper house of parliament) and a third of Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament), after consulting the Council of State, decline to sign a bill \"of such national importance that the will of the people thereon ought to be ascertained\" in an ordinary referendum or a new Dáil reassembling after a general election held within eighteen months. This latter power has never been used because the government of the day almost always commands a majority of the Seanad, preventing the third of the Dáil that usually makes up the opposition from combining with it.\n\nThe President of Italy may request a second deliberation of a bill passed by Parliament before it is promulgated. This is a very weak form of veto as the Parliament can override the veto by an ordinary majority. The same provision exists in France and Latvia. While such a limited veto cannot thwart the will of a determined parliamentary majority, it may have a delaying effect and may cause the parliamentary majority to reconsider the matter. The President of Republic can also call a new election for parliament. He can also veto minister nominations, as happened in 2018.\n\nThe President of Estonia may effectively veto a law adopted by Estonian parliament by refusing to proclaim it and demanding a new debate and decision. The parliament, in its turn, may override this veto by passing the law unamended for the second time (a simple majority is enough). In this case the President is obliged to proclaim the law or to request the Supreme Court of Estonia to declare the law unconstitutional. If the Supreme Court rules that the law does not violate the Constitution, the President may not object any more and is obliged to finally proclaim the law.\n\nThe President of Latvia may suspend a bill for a period of two months, during which it may be referred to the people in a referendum if a certain number of signatures are gathered. This is potentially a much stronger form of veto, as it enables the President to appeal to the people against the wishes of the Parliament and Government.\n\nThe President of Poland may submit a bill to the Constitutional Tribunal if he suspects that bill is unconstitutional or send it back to the Sejm for a second voting. If the Tribunal says that the bill is constitutional or if Sejm passes it by at least three-fifths of the votes, the President must sign the bill.\n\nThe President of Portugal may refuse to sign a bill or refer it, or parts of it, to the Constitutional Court. If the President refuses to sign bill without it being declared unconstitutional, the Assembly of the Republic (parliament) may pass it again, in which case it becomes law.\n\nThe President of Ukraine may refuse to sign a bill and return it to Parliament with his proposals. If the parliament agrees on his proposals, the President must sign the bill. Parliament may overturn a veto by a two-thirds majority. If Parliament overturns his veto, the President must sign the bill within 10 days.\n\nIn the constitution Poland or the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the 17th and 18th centuries, there was an institution called the liberum veto. All bills had to pass the \"Sejm\" or \"Seimas\" (Parliament) by unanimous consent, and if any legislator voted \"nay\" on anything, this not only vetoed that bill but also dissolved that legislative session itself. The concept originated in the idea of \"Polish democracy\" as any Pole of noble extraction was considered as good as any other, no matter how low or high his material condition might be. It was never exercised, however, under the rule of the strong Polish royal dynasties, which came to an end in the mid-17th century. These were followed by an elective kingship. As might be expected, the more and more frequent use of this veto power paralyzed the power of the legislature and, combined with a string of weak figurehead kings, led ultimately to the partitioning and the dissolution of the Polish state in the late 18th century.\n\nThe President of the Philippines may refuse to sign a bill, sending the bill back to the house where it originated along with his objections. Congress can override the veto via a two-thirds vote with both houses voting separately, after which the bill becomes law. The president may also veto specific provisions on money bills without affecting other provisions on the same bill. The president cannot veto a bill due to inaction; once the bill has been received by the president, the chief executive has thirty days to veto the bill. Once the thirty-day period expires, the bill becomes law as if the president had signed it.\n\n"}

Reporting on a Pew study, the \"Washington Post\" has noted that polls of \"likely voters\" represent the \"Holy Grail of polling\" and are most likely to accurately reflect the outcome of an election.\n\nAn analysis of 2010 polling by Five Thirty Eight concluded that polls of \"registered voters\" that year tended to favor Democratic candidates by a factor of five percentage points over the actual results of the election, while polls of \"likely voters\" tended to favor Republican candidates by a factor of one percentage point over the actual results of the election. According to the \"Huffington Post\" this is because registered voters who are least likely to actually cast a ballot tend to be low-income voters, or persons living in urban areas, which are constituencies that tend to favor Democratic candidates. A 2018 study by the Pew Research Center found that registered voters tend to lean more to the Democratic Party than to the Republican Party, stating that \"For those individuals identified as registered to vote by state governments, the voter file has a score (ranging from 0 to 100) describing their likelihood of voting for Democrats or Republicans, with higher numbers indicating a preference for Democrats. According to the full voter file, 55% of all registered voters in the U.S. are likely Democrats and 33% are likely Republicans.\" \n\nPolls targeting \"likely voters\" generally begin with a list of known registered voters and then ask respondents a series of screening questions before the survey is conducted. Often this can simply be \"are you going to vote on Election Day?\" with respondents who answer \"yes\" to the question being included in the survey's final results, and those who answer \"no\" being excluded. In other cases, complex formulas that account for a variety of demographic and psychographic variables are applied.\n"}
{"id": "1749565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1749565", "title": "Vowel reduction", "text": "Vowel reduction\n\nIn phonetics, vowel reduction is any of various changes in the acoustic \"quality\" of vowels, which are related to changes in stress, sonority, duration, loudness, articulation, or position in the word (e.g. for the Creek language), and which are perceived as \"weakening\". It most often makes the vowels shorter as well.\n\nSuch a vowel may be called \"reduced\" or \"weak\". In contrast, an unreduced vowel may be described as \"full\" or \"strong\".\n\nPhonetic reduction most often involves a centralization of the vowel, that is, a reduction in the amount of movement of the tongue in pronouncing the vowel, as with the characteristic change of many unstressed vowels at the ends of English words to something approaching schwa. A well-researched type of reduction is that of the neutralization of acoustic distinctions in unstressed vowels, which occurs in many languages. The most common reduced vowel is schwa.\n\nWhereas full vowels are distinguished by height, backness, and roundness, according to , reduced unstressed vowels are largely unconcerned with height or roundness. English , for example, may range phonetically from mid to to open ; English ranges from close , , , to open-mid . The primary distinction is that is further front than , contrasted in the numerous English words ending in unstressed \"-ia.\" That is, the jaw, which to a large extent controls vowel height, tends to be relaxed when pronouncing reduced vowels. Similarly, English ranges through and ; although it may be labialized to varying degrees, the lips are relaxed in comparison to , , or . The primary distinction in words like \"folio\" is again one of backness. However, the backness distinction is not as great as that of full vowels; reduced vowels are also centralized, and are sometimes referred to by that term. They may also be called \"obscure,\" as there is no one-to-one correspondence between full and reduced vowels.\n\nSound duration is a common factor in reduction: In fast speech, vowels are reduced due to physical limitations of the articulatory organs, e.g., the tongue cannot move to a prototypical position fast or completely enough to produce a full-quality vowel (compare with clipping). Different languages have different types of vowel reduction, and this is one of the difficulties in language acquisition; see, e.g., \"Non-native pronunciations of English\" and \"Anglophone pronunciation of foreign languages\". Vowel reduction of second language speakers is a separate study.\n\nStress-related vowel reduction is a principal factor in the development of Indo-European ablaut, as well as other changes reconstructed by historical linguistics.\n\nThere are several ways to distinguish full and reduced vowels in transcription. Some English dictionaries mark full vowels for secondary stress, so that e.g. is a full unstressed while is a reduced unstressed \"schwi\". The vowel quality may be considered distinct, with reduced vowels centralized, e.g. with full vs reduced . Some transcriptions of English and Russian use non-IPA letters for reduced vowels, such as and in English.\n\nSuch vowel reduction is one of the sources of distinction between a spoken language and its written counterpart. Vernacular and formal speech often have different levels of vowel reduction, and so the term \"vowel reduction\" is also applied to differences in a language variety with respect to, e.g., the language standard.\n\nSome languages, such as Finnish, Hindi, and classical Spanish, are claimed to lack vowel reduction. Such languages are often called syllable-timed languages. At the other end of the spectrum, Mexican Spanish is characterized by the reduction or loss of the unstressed vowels, mainly when they are in contact with the sound . It can be the case that the words \"pesos\", \"pesas\", and \"peces\" are pronounced the same: .\n\nIn some cases phonetic vowel reduction may contribute to \"phonemic\" (phonological) reduction, which means merger of phonemes, induced by indistinguishable pronunciation.\nThis sense of vowel reduction may occur by means other than vowel centralisation, however. Many Germanic languages, in their early stages, reduced the number of vowels that could occur in unstressed syllables, without (or before) clearly showing centralisation. Proto-Germanic and its early descendant Gothic still allowed more or less the full complement of vowels and diphthongs to appear in unstressed syllables, except notably short /e/, which merged with /i/. In early Old High German and Old Saxon, this had been reduced to five vowels (i, e, a, o, u, some with length distinction), later reduced further to just three short vowels (i/e, a, o/u). In Old Norse, likewise, only three vowels were written in unstressed syllables: a, i and u (their exact phonetic quality is unknown). Old English, meanwhile, distinguished only e, a, and u (again the exact phonetic quality is unknown). Catalan, a Romance language, also shows reduction, but in differing degrees depending on dialect. The Valencian dialect reduces the number of possible vowels from seven to five in unstressed environments, merging into and into . The central Catalan dialect goes even further, distinguishing only , and , with , and becoming and and merging into . In Italian, the vowels noted e and o in spelling are pronounced and in unstressed syllables.\n\nStress is a prominent feature of the English language, both at the level of the word \"(lexical stress)\" and at the level of the phrase or sentence \"(prosodic stress)\". Absence of stress on a syllable, or on a word in some cases, is frequently associated in English with vowel reduction – many such syllables are pronounced with a centralized vowel (schwa) or with certain other vowels that are described as being \"reduced\" (or sometimes with a syllabic consonant as the syllable nucleus rather than a vowel). Various phonological analyses exist for these phenomena.\n\nOld Latin had initial stress, and short vowels in non-initial syllables were frequently reduced. Long vowels were usually not reduced.\n\nVowels reduced in different ways depending on the phonological environment. For instance, in most cases they reduced to . Before \"l pinguis\", an not followed by , they became Old Latin and Classical Latin . Before and some consonant clusters, they became .\n\n\nIn Classical Latin, stress changed position, so in some cases reduced vowels became stressed. Stress moved to the penult if it was heavy or the antepenult in other cases.\n\nIn the Bulgarian language the vowels \"а\", \"о\" and \"е\" can be reduced when unstressed to \"ъ\", \"у\" and \"и\", respectively. The most prevalent is \"а\" > \"ъ\", while \"о\" > \"у\" is considered incorrect in literary speech. The last reduction \"е\" > \"и\" is prevalent in the more Eastern dialects of the language.\n\nThere are five vowel phonemes in Standard Russian. Vowels tend to merge when they are unstressed. The vowels /a/ and /o/ have the same unstressed allophones for a number of dialects and reduce to a schwa. Unstressed /e/ may become more central if it does not merge with /i/.\n\nOther types of reduction are phonetic, such as that of high vowels (/i/ and /u/), which become near-close so этап ('stage') is pronounced [ɪˈtap], and мужчина ('man') is pronounced [mʊˈɕːinə].\n\nThe Proto-Slavic language possessed two short high vowels known as yers: a short high front vowel denoted as ĭ or ь, and a short back vowel denoted as ŭ or ъ. These vowels underwent reduction and were eventually deleted in certain positions in a word in the early Slavic languages, beginning from the late dialects of Proto-Slavic. This process is known as Havlík's law.\n\n\n"}

Opened in the 13th century, the mine produced table salt continuously until 2007, as one of the world's oldest salt mines in operation. Throughout, the royal mine was run by the \"Żupy krakowskie\" Salt Mines company.\n\nCommercial mining was discontinued in 1996, because of salt prices going down and also mine flooding. The mine is currently one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (\"Pomniki historii\"), whose attractions include dozens of statues and four chapels carved out of the rock salt by the miners, as well as supplemental carvings made by contemporary artists.\n\nThe Wieliczka salt mine reaches a depth of 327 meters and is over long. The rock salt is naturally grey in various shades, resembling unpolished granite rather than the white or crystalline look that many visitors may expect. In the 13th century, rock salt was discovered in Wieliczka and the first shafts were dug. The construction of the Saltworks Castle in Wieliczka (the central building – “The House within the Saltworks”) – head office of the mine’s board since medieval times till 1945. The Saltworks Castle was built in the late 13th to early 14th century. Wieliczka is now the location of the Kraków Saltworks Museum. Many shafts were dug throughout the time the mine was in operation. Different technology was added such as the Hungarian-type horse treadmill and Saxon treadmills to haul the salt to the top of the surface. During World War II, the shafts were used by the occupying Germans as an \"ad hoc\" facility for various war-related industries. The mine features an underground lake; and the new exhibits on the history of salt mining, as well as a touring route (less than 2% of the length of the mine's passages) that includes historic statues and mythical figures carved out of rock salt in distant past. More recent sculptures have been fashioned by contemporary artists.\n\nThe Wieliczka mine is often referred to as \"the Underground Salt Cathedral of Poland\". In 1978 it was placed on the original UNESCO list of the World Heritage Sites. Even the crystals of the chandeliers are made from rock salt that has been dissolved and reconstituted to achieve a clear, glass-like appearance. It also houses a private rehabilitation and wellness complex.\n\nThere is a legend about Princess Kinga, associated with the Wieliczka mine. The Hungarian princess was about to be married to Bolesław V the Chaste, the Prince of Kraków. As part of her dowry, she asked her father, Béla IV of Hungary, for a lump of salt, since salt was prizeworthy in Poland. Her father King Béla took her to a salt mine in Máramaros. She threw her engagement ring from Bolesław in one of the shafts before leaving for Poland. On arriving in Kraków, she asked the miners to dig a deep pit until they come upon a rock. The people found a lump of salt in there and when they split it in two, discovered the princess's ring. Kinga had thus become the patron saint of salt miners in and around the Polish capital.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation, several thousand Jews were transported from the forced labour camps in Plaszow and Mielec to the Wieliczka mine to work in the underground armament factory set up by the Germans. However, manufacturing never began as the Soviet offensive was nearing. Some of the machines and equipment were disassembled, including an electrical hoisting machine from the Regis Shaft, and transported to Liebenau in the Sudetes mountains. Part of the equipment was returned after the war, in autumn 1945. The Jews were transported to factories in the Czech Republic and Austria.\n\nThe mine is one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (\"Pomniki historii\"), as designated in the first round, 16 September 1994. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland.\nIn 2010 it was successfully proposed that the nearby historic Bochnia Salt Mine (Poland's oldest salt mine) be added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites. The two sister salt mines now appear together in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites as the \"Wieliczka and Bochnia Royal Salt Mines\". In 2013 the UNESCO World Heritage Site was expanded by the addition of the Żupny Castle.\n\nThe mine is currently one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (\"Pomniki historii\"), whose attractions include dozens of statues and four chapels carved out of the rock salt by the miners. The older sculptures have been supplemented with new carvings made by contemporary artists. About 1.2 million people visit the Wieliczka Salt Mine annually.\n\nNotable visitors to this site have included Nicolaus Copernicus, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Alexander von Humboldt, Fryderyk Chopin, Dmitri Mendeleyev, Bolesław Prus, Ignacy Paderewski, Robert Baden-Powell, Jacob Bronowski (who filmed segments of \"The Ascent of Man\" in the mine), the von Unrug family (a prominent Polish-German royal family), Karol Wojtyła (later, Pope John Paul II), former U.S. President Bill Clinton, and many others.\n\nThere is a chapel, and a reception room that is used for private functions, including weddings. A chamber has walls carved by miners to resemble wood, as in wooden churches built in early centuries. A wooden staircase provides access to the mine's 64-metre (210-foot) level. A 3-kilometre (1.9-mile) tour features corridors, chapels, statues, and underground lake, underground. An elevator (lift) returns visitors to the surface; the elevator holds 36 persons (nine per car) and takes some 30 seconds to make the trip.\n\nThe earliest writings about the Wieliczka Salt Mine include a description by Adam Schröter: \"Salinarum Vieliciensium incunda ac vera descriptio. Carmine elegiaco...\" (1553); augmented edition: \"Regni Poloniae Salinarum Vieliciensium descriptio. Carmine elegiaco...\" (1564).\n\nThe Polish journalist and novelist Bolesław Prus described his 1878 visit to the salt mine in a remarkable series of three articles, \"Kartki z podróży (Wieliczka)\" [\"Travel Notes (Wieliczka)\"], in \"Kurier Warszawski\" (The Warsaw Courier), 1878, nos. 36–38. The great Prus scholar Zygmunt Szweykowski writes: \"The power of the Labyrinth scenes [in Prus' 1895 historical novel, \"Pharaoh\"] stems, among other things, from the fact that they echo Prus' own experiences when visiting Wieliczka.\" The Wieliczka Salt Mine indeed helped inspire \"Pharaoh\". Prus combined his powerful impressions of the salt mine with the description of the ancient Egyptian Labyrinth, in Book II of Herodotus' \"Histories\", to produce the remarkable scenes found in chapters 56 and 63 of his novel.\n\nIn 1995, \"Preisner's Music\", a compilation of film music by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner, was recorded by \"Sinfonia Varsovia\" in the Wieliczka mine's chapel. The chapel is often said to have the best acoustics in Europe.\n\nIn the Australia television series , the mines were used as the Land of the Moloch.\n\n\n\n\n"}
