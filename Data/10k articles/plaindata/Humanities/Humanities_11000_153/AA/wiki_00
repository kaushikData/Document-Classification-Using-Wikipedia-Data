Leaders to twenty Arab countries were present, including King Hussein of Jordan and Anwar Sadat of Egypt, together with representatives of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). A unanimous resolution was passed which, for the first time, declared the PLO to be the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.\" Furthermore, the Arab League resolved that the \"oil-rich Arab states ... [provide] multi-annual financial aid to the [states in confrontation with Israel] and the PLO.\"\n\nThe summit shaped the future of the conflict in several ways. First, it forced King Hussein to relinquish his claim to be able to speak for the Palestinians and to acknowledge that a future Palestinian state would have to be independent of Jordan. Second, it \"weakened the American position. [U.S. Secretary of State Henry] Kissinger agreed with the Israelis that it was preferable to negotiate with Hussein rather than with the PLO.\"\n\nA Fatah plot to assassinate Hussein upon his arrival to the summit was uncovered by Moroccan authorities.\n\n\n"}

The earliest records of accession celebrations date from the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and the custom is now observed in many nations.\n\nAccession Day in India's Jammu and Kashmir commemorates the day in 1947 when the area joined the Dominion of India.\n\nIn Belgium there are local celebrations of the reigning monarch's accession, but the anniversary of the accession of the first King of modern Belgium, Leopold I, on 21 July 1831, is celebrated as a full national holiday, known as \"Belgian National Day\".\n\nAccession Day is a state holiday in India's northernmost state, Jammu and Kashmir, commemorating 26 October 1947, when Maharaja Hari Singh signed off the Instrument of Accession, in which Jammu and Kashmir joined the Dominion of India. This was part of the series of events in 1947 by which rule the Indian Empire was converted into the two new Dominions of India and Pakistan, the latter having two territories separated by the whole of northern India. As a Hindu ruler of a state with both Hindu and Muslim subjects, the Maharaja's decision was crucial.\n\nFestivities of the day include holding rallies, lighting firecrackers, singing India's national anthem, and raising the flag of India.\n\n\"Koninginnedag\" (Queen's Day) was, during the reign of Queen Beatrix, celebrated on 30 April, the date of her accession in 1980 upon the abdication of her mother, Queen Juliana, whose birthday fell on 30 April). Beatrix abdicated on Koninginnedag 2013 which, led to the accession of King Willem-Alexander. As a result, the holiday became known as Koningsdag (King's Day) from 2014 and the celebration was moved three days ahead to 27 April, to instead mark the birthday of Willem-Alexander.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is unusual in celebrating the accession of its President, although the President is elected from amongst the seven hereditary Emirs (ruling Princes) of the constituent states of the UAE, and is therefore also a hereditary and monarchical leader. Accession Day is a national holiday in the UAE.\n\nThe custom of marking this day was inaugurated during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I of England. Her accession day was celebrated in England and Wales during her reign and also, according to the 19th-century historian Thomas Lathbury, during the reigns of her successors. A \"Form of Prayer and Thanksgiving\" to be used in churches on the anniversary of the queen's accession was published in 1576 and used until 1602.\n\nIn 1568, the tenth anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's accession was marked with the ringing of bells and 17 November became known as \"Queen Elizabeth's Day\" or \"Queene's Day\". As her reign progressed, it was celebrated with increased fervour and, long after her death, it continued to be observed as a day of Protestant rejoicing and expression of anti-Catholic feeling. The observances included triumphal parades and processions, sermons against populism and the burning of the Pope in effigy. After the Great Fire of London (1666), \"these rejoicings were converted into a satirical saturnalia of the most turbulent kind\"; the greatest excesses occurred in the years 1679–81 when wealthy members of political clubs paid for processions and bonfires to arouse the populace to political fervour. The inhabitants of Berry Pomeroy in south Devon reinstated the tradition of Queene's Day in 2005 with a special church service and bonfire.\n\nOn the accession of King James I of England, a form of prayer and thanksgiving was issued for use in all churches \"upon his entry to this kingdom\". In 1625, a new service was issued which was sanctioned by Convocation in 1640 but set aside by Parliament at the Restoration when certain parts of it were included in the special service for 29 May. When King James II acceded the throne, he ordered the preparation of a special form of prayer and thanksgiving for the anniversary of his accession day and a revised version of the old service was prepared and set forth by authority in 1685. The form of words \"the day on which His Majesty began his happy reign\" was first used in this service and has been retained ever since. After falling out of use during the reigns of William III and Mary II, the service was revised and used again during the reign of Queen Anne. King George V's accession day (reigned 1910–36) was 6 May.\n\nThe present monarch, Elizabeth II's accession day is 6 February and is observed in the United Kingdom by the flying of specific flags and various official functions. In London, a Royal Salute is fired by the guns of the King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park and by the Honourable Artillery Company at the Tower of London. Salutes are also fired at Woolwich, Colchester, Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle, Cardiff, Belfast, York, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Dover Castle.\n\nSpecial services are required by canon in all cathedrals, churches, and chapels of the Church of England. The Book of Common Prayer provides options for a stand-alone Accession Day service, or for special propers by which any or all of the services of Matins, Evensong and Holy Communion may be altered for the day. The Church's more recent prayer book Common Worship does not provide a full form of service, but refers the user to the Book of Common Prayer; it does, however, provide propers for the Eucharist on 6 February. Although not a legal requirement, special services are also held in some churches of other denominations.\n\nThe Vatican counts the \"Anniversario dell'Elezione del Santo Padre\", or the anniversary of the election of the reigning pontiff, among its statutory public holidays. Since 2014, the city-state has observed this holiday on March 13, the anniversary of Pope Francis' election in 2013.\n\n"}

These orders emphasize patient comfort and pain management instead of life extension. Currently, American medical communities utilize “do not resuscitate,” (DNR) orders to define patients’ medical wishes. Those who propose to replace DNR with AND posit that DNR orders are ambiguous and require complex understanding between several parties, while AND orders are clearer.\n\nDNR orders range from solely prohibiting the use of resuscitation to prohibiting any action seen as life extending. Because there are many parties involved in a patient’s end of life care - significant others, family, personal doctors, specialists and nurses - DNR orders are not always completely clear, leaving open possible violation of the patient’s wishes. “DNR orders may lead to conflict, unnecessary suffering, and inappropriate care at the EOL [end of life.]” Those who propose to replace DNR orders with AND orders posit that AND are less ambiguous, clearly instructing medical personnel to not use any artificial, life extending measures. This would be especially helpful in regards to emergency care, when medical personnel who are unfamiliar with the patient must decide what medical practices should be used. Furthermore, proponents of AND claim that because it contains “death” in the title it is more clear to the patient and family exactly what the patient is agreeing to.\n\nCritics of AND claim it is simply the replacement of one ambiguous term with another. Just as DNR particulars vary so too would AND particulars vary. Thus, the change would be ineffective.\n\n"}

He was the main proponent of the genre named epic theatre (which he preferred to call \"dialectical theatre\"). During the Nazi period and World War II he lived in exile, first in Scandinavia and then in the United States. Returning to East Berlin after the war, he established the theatre company Berliner Ensemble with his wife and long-time collaborator, actress Helene Weigel.\n\nEugen Berthold Friedrich Brecht (as a child known as Eugen) was born in February 1898 in Augsburg, Bavaria, the son of Berthold Friedrich Brecht (1869–1939) and his wife Sophie, née Brezing (1871–1920). Brecht's mother was a devout Protestant and his father a Roman Catholic (who had been persuaded to have a Protestant wedding). The modest house where he was born is today preserved as a Brecht Museum. His father worked for a paper mill, becoming its managing director in 1914.\n\nDue to his mother's influence, Brecht knew the Bible, a familiarity that would have a lifelong effect on his writing. From her, too, came the \"dangerous image of the self-denying woman\" that recurs in his drama. Brecht's home life was comfortably middle class, despite what his occasional attempt to claim peasant origins implied. At school in Augsburg he met Caspar Neher, with whom he formed a lifelong creative partnership. Neher designed many of the sets for Brecht's dramas and helped to forge the distinctive visual iconography of their epic theatre.\n\nWhen Brecht was 16, the First World War broke out. Initially enthusiastic, Brecht soon changed his mind on seeing his classmates \"swallowed by the army\". Brecht was nearly expelled from school in 1915 for writing an essay in response to the line \"Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori\" from the Roman poet Horace, calling it \"Zweckpropaganda\" (\"cheap propaganda for a specific purpose\") and arguing that only an empty-headed person could be persuaded to die for their country. His expulsion was only prevented through the intervention of his religion teacher.\n\nOn his father's recommendation, Brecht sought a loophole by registering for a medical course at Munich University, where he enrolled in 1917. There he studied drama with Arthur Kutscher, who inspired in the young Brecht an admiration for the iconoclastic dramatist and cabaret-star Frank Wedekind.\n\nFrom July 1916, Brecht's newspaper articles began appearing under the new name \"Bert Brecht\" (his first theatre criticism for the \"Augsburger Volkswille\" appeared in October 1919). Brecht was drafted into military service in the autumn of 1918, only to be posted back to Augsburg as a medical orderly in a military VD clinic; the war ended a month later.\n\nIn July 1919, Brecht and (who had begun a relationship in 1917) had a son, Frank. In 1920 Brecht's mother died.\n\nSome time in either 1920 or 1921, Brecht took a small part in the political cabaret of the Munich comedian Karl Valentin. Brecht's diaries for the next few years record numerous visits to see Valentin perform. Brecht compared Valentin to Charlie Chaplin, for his \"virtually complete rejection of mimicry and cheap psychology\". Writing in his \"Messingkauf Dialogues\" years later, Brecht identified Valentin, along with Wedekind and Büchner, as his \"chief influences\" at that time:\n\nBrecht's first full-length play, \"Baal\" (written 1918), arose in response to an argument in one of Kutscher's drama seminars, initiating a trend that persisted throughout his career of creative activity that was generated by a desire to counter another work (both others' and his own, as his many adaptations and re-writes attest). \"Anyone can be creative,\" he quipped, \"it's rewriting other people that's a challenge.\" Brecht completed his second major play, \"Drums in the Night\", in February 1919.\n\nBetween November 1921 and April 1922 Brecht made acquaintance with many influential people in the Berlin cultural scene. Amongst them was the playwright Arnolt Bronnen with whom he established a joint venture, the Arnolt Bronnen / Bertolt Brecht Company. Brecht changed the spelling of his first name to Bertolt to rhyme with Arnolt.\n\nIn 1922 while still living in Munich, Brecht came to the attention of an influential Berlin critic, Herbert Ihering: \"At 24 the writer Bert Brecht has changed Germany's literary complexion overnight\"—he enthused in his review of Brecht's first play to be produced, \"Drums in the Night\"—\"[he] has given our time a new tone, a new melody, a new vision. [...] It is a language you can feel on your tongue, in your gums, your ear, your spinal column.\" In November it was announced that Brecht had been awarded the prestigious Kleist Prize (intended for unestablished writers and probably Germany's most significant literary award, until it was abolished in 1932) for his first three plays (\"Baal\", \"Drums in the Night\", and \"In the Jungle\", although at that point only \"Drums\" had been produced). The citation for the award insisted that:\n\n[Brecht's] language is vivid without being deliberately poetic, symbolical without being over literary. Brecht is a dramatist because his language is felt physically and in the round.\nThat year he married the Viennese opera-singer Marianne Zoff. Their daughter—Hanne Hiob (1923–2009)—was a successful German actress.\n\nIn 1923, Brecht wrote a scenario for what was to become a short slapstick film, \"Mysteries of a Barbershop\", directed by Erich Engel and starring Karl Valentin. Despite a lack of success at the time, its experimental inventiveness and the subsequent success of many of its contributors have meant that it is now considered one of the most important films in German film history. In May of that year, Brecht's \"In the Jungle\" premiered in Munich, also directed by Engel. Opening night proved to be a \"scandal\"—a phenomenon that would characterize many of his later productions during the Weimar Republic—in which Nazis blew whistles and threw stink bombs at the actors on the stage.\n\nIn 1924 Brecht worked with the novelist and playwright Lion Feuchtwanger (whom he had met in 1919) on an adaptation of Christopher Marlowe's \"Edward II\" that proved to be a milestone in Brecht's early theatrical and dramaturgical development. Brecht's \"Edward II\" constituted his first attempt at collaborative writing and was the first of many classic texts he was to adapt. As his first solo directorial début, he later credited it as the germ of his conception of \"epic theatre\". That September, a job as assistant dramaturg at Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater—at the time one of the leading three or four theatres in the world—brought him to Berlin.\n\nIn 1923 Brecht's marriage to Zoff began to break down (though they did not divorce until 1927). Brecht had become involved with both Elisabeth Hauptmann and Helene Weigel. Brecht and Weigel's son, Stefan, was born in October 1924.\n\nIn his role as dramaturg, Brecht had much to stimulate him but little work of his own. Reinhardt staged Shaw's \"Saint Joan\", Goldoni's \"Servant of Two Masters\" (with the improvisational approach of the \"commedia dell'arte\" in which the actors chatted with the prompter about their roles), and Pirandello's \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" in his group of Berlin theatres. A new version of Brecht's third play, now entitled \"Jungle: Decline of a Family\", opened at the Deutsches Theater in October 1924, but was not a success.\n\nAt this time Brecht revised his important \"transitional poem\", \"Of Poor BB\". In 1925, his publishers provided him with Elisabeth Hauptmann as an assistant for the completion of his collection of poems, \"Devotions for the Home\" (\"Hauspostille\", eventually published in January 1927). She continued to work with him after the publisher's commission ran out.\n\nIn 1925 in Mannheim the artistic exhibition \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (\"New Objectivity\") had given its name to the new post-Expressionist movement in the German arts. With little to do at the Deutsches Theater, Brecht began to develop his \"Man Equals Man\" project, which was to become the first product of \"the 'Brecht collective'—that shifting group of friends and collaborators on whom he henceforward depended.\" This collaborative approach to artistic production, together with aspects of Brecht's writing and style of theatrical production, mark Brecht's work from this period as part of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" movement. The collective's work \"mirrored the artistic climate of the middle 1920s,\" Willett and Manheim argue:\nwith their attitude of \"Neue Sachlichkeit\" (or New Matter-of-Factness), their stressing of the collectivity and downplaying of the individual, and their new cult of Anglo-Saxon imagery and sport. Together the \"collective\" would go to fights, not only absorbing their terminology and ethos (which permeates \"Man Equals Man\") but also drawing those conclusions for the theatre as a whole which Brecht set down in his theoretical essay \"Emphasis on Sport\" and tried to realise by means of the harsh lighting, the boxing-ring stage and other anti-illusionistic devices that henceforward appeared in his own productions.\n\nIn 1925, Brecht also saw two films that had a significant influence on him: Chaplin's \"The Gold Rush\" and Eisenstein's \"Battleship Potemkin\". Brecht had compared Valentin to Chaplin, and the two of them provided models for Galy Gay in \"Man Equals Man\". Brecht later wrote that Chaplin \"would in many ways come closer to the epic than to the dramatic theatre's requirements.\" They met several times during Brecht's time in the United States, and discussed Chaplin's \"Monsieur Verdoux\" project, which it is possible Brecht influenced.\n\nIn 1926 a series of short stories was published under Brecht's name, though Hauptmann was closely associated with writing them. Following the production of \"Man Equals Man\" in Darmstadt that year, Brecht began studying Marxism and socialism in earnest, under the supervision of Hauptmann. \"When I read Marx's \"Capital\"\", a note by Brecht reveals, \"I understood my plays.\" Marx was, it continues, \"the only spectator for my plays I'd ever come across.\" Inspired by the developments in USSR Brecht wrote a number of agitprop plays, praising the bolshevik collectivism (replaceability of each member of the collective in \"Man Equals Man\") and red terror (\"The Decision\").\nIn 1927 Brecht became part of the \"dramaturgical collective\" of Erwin Piscator's first company, which was designed to tackle the problem of finding new plays for its \"epic, political, confrontational, documentary theatre\". Brecht collaborated with Piscator during the period of the latter's landmark productions, \"Hoppla, We're Alive!\" by Toller, \"Rasputin\", \"The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik\", and \"Konjunktur\" by Lania. Brecht's most significant contribution was to the adaptation of the unfinished episodic comic novel \"Schweik\", which he later described as a \"montage from the novel\". The Piscator productions influenced Brecht's ideas about staging and design, and alerted him to the radical potentials offered to the \"epic\" playwright by the development of stage technology (particularly projections). What Brecht took from Piscator \"is fairly plain, and he acknowledged it\" Willett suggests:\nThe emphasis on Reason and didacticism, the sense that the new subject matter demanded a new dramatic form, the use of songs to interrupt and comment: all these are found in his notes and essays of the 1920s, and he bolstered them by citing such Piscatorial examples as the step-by-step narrative technique of \"Schweik\" and the oil interests handled in \"Konjunktur\" ('Petroleum resists the five-act form').\nBrecht was struggling at the time with the question of how to dramatize the complex economic relationships of modern capitalism in his unfinished project \"Joe P. Fleischhacker\" (which Piscator's theatre announced in its programme for the 1927–28 season). It wasn't until his \"Saint Joan of the Stockyards\" (written between 1929–1931) that Brecht solved it. In 1928 he discussed with Piscator plans to stage Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\" and Brecht's own \"Drums in the Night\", but the productions did not materialize.\n\n1927 also saw the first collaboration between Brecht and the young composer Kurt Weill. Together they began to develop Brecht's \"Mahagonny\" project, along thematic lines of the biblical Cities of the Plain but rendered in terms of the \"Neue Sachlichkeit\"'s \"Amerikanismus\", which had informed Brecht's previous work. They produced \"The Little Mahagonny\" for a music festival in July, as what Weill called a \"stylistic exercise\" in preparation for the large-scale piece. From that point on Caspar Neher became an integral part of the collaborative effort, with words, music and visuals conceived in relation to one another from the start. The model for their mutual articulation lay in Brecht's newly formulated principle of the \"separation of the elements\", which he first outlined in \"The Modern Theatre Is the Epic Theatre\" (1930). The principle, a variety of montage, proposed by-passing the \"great struggle for supremacy between words, music and production\" as Brecht put it, by showing each as self-contained, independent works of art that adopt attitudes towards one another.\n\nIn 1930 Brecht married Weigel; their daughter Barbara Brecht was born soon after the wedding. She also became an actress and would later hold the copyrights to all of Brecht's work.\n\nBrecht formed a writing collective which became prolific and very influential. Elisabeth Hauptmann, Margarete Steffin, Emil Burri, Ruth Berlau and others worked with Brecht and produced the multiple teaching plays, which attempted to create a new dramaturgy for participants rather than passive audiences. These addressed themselves to the massive worker arts organisation that existed in Germany and Austria in the 1920s. So did Brecht's first great play, \"Saint Joan of the Stockyards\", which attempts to portray the drama in financial transactions.\n\nThis collective adapted John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\", with Brecht's lyrics set to music by Kurt Weill. Retitled \"The Threepenny Opera\" (\"Die Dreigroschenoper\") it was the biggest hit in Berlin of the 1920s and a renewing influence on the musical worldwide. One of its most famous lines underscored the hypocrisy of conventional morality imposed by the Church, working in conjunction with the established order, in the face of working-class hunger and deprivation:\n\nThe success of \"The Threepenny Opera\" was followed by the quickly thrown together \"Happy End\". It was a personal and a commercial failure. At the time the book was purported to be by the mysterious Dorothy Lane (now known to be Elisabeth Hauptmann, Brecht's secretary and close collaborator). Brecht only claimed authorship of the song texts. Brecht would later use elements of \"Happy End\" as the germ for his \"Saint Joan of the Stockyards\", a play that would never see the stage in Brecht's lifetime. \"Happy End\"'s score by Weill produced many Brecht/Weill hits like \"Der Bilbao-Song\" and \"Surabaya-Jonny\".\n\nThe masterpiece of the Brecht/Weill collaborations, \"Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny\" (\"Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny\"), caused an uproar when it premiered in 1930 in Leipzig, with Nazis in the audience protesting. The \"Mahagonny\" opera would premier later in Berlin in 1931 as a triumphant sensation.\n\nBrecht spent the last years of the Weimar-era (1930–1933) in Berlin working with his \"collective\" on the \"Lehrstücke\". These were a group of plays driven by morals, music and Brecht's budding epic theatre. The \"Lehrstücke\" often aimed at educating workers on Socialist issues. \"The Measures Taken\" (\"Die Massnahme\") was scored by Hanns Eisler. In addition, Brecht worked on a script for a semi-documentary feature film about the human impact of mass unemployment, \"Kuhle Wampe\" (1932), which was directed by Slatan Dudow. This striking film is notable for its subversive humour, outstanding cinematography by Günther Krampf, and Hanns Eisler's dynamic musical contribution. It still provides a vivid insight into Berlin during the last years of the Weimar Republic.\n\nFearing persecution, Brecht left Nazi Germany in February 1933, just after Hitler took power. After brief spells in Prague, Zurich and Paris he and Weigel accepted an invitation from journalist and author Karin Michaëlis to move to Denmark. The family first stayed with Karin Michaëlis at her house on the small island of Thurø close to the island of Funen. They later bought their own house in Svendborg on Funen. This house located at Skovsbo Strand 8 in Svendborg became the residence of the Brecht family for the next six years, where they often received guests including Walter Benjamin, Hanns Eisler and Ruth Berlau. During this period Brecht also travelled frequently to Copenhagen, Paris, Moscow, New York and London for various projects and collaborations.\n\nWhen war seemed imminent in April 1939, he moved to Stockholm, Sweden, where he remained for a year. After Hitler invaded Norway and Denmark, Brecht left Sweden for Helsinki, Finland, where he lived and waited for his visa for the United States until 3 May 1941. During this time he wrote the play \"Mr Puntila and his Man Matti\" (\"Herr Puntila und sein Knecht Matti\") with Hella Wuolijoki, with whom he lived in .\n\nDuring the war years, Brecht became a prominent writer of the Exilliteratur. He expressed his opposition to the National Socialist and Fascist movements in his most famous plays: \"Life of Galileo\", \"Mother Courage and Her Children\", \"The Good Person of Szechwan\", \"The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui\", \"The Caucasian Chalk Circle\", \"Fear and Misery of the Third Reich\", and many others.\n\nBrecht co-wrote the screenplay for the Fritz Lang-directed film \"Hangmen Also Die!\" which was loosely based on the 1942 assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Nazi Deputy Reich Protector of the German-occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Heinrich Himmler's right-hand man in the SS, and a chief architect of the Holocaust, who was known as \"The Hangman of Prague.\" Hanns Eisler was nominated for an Academy Award for his musical score. The collaboration of three prominent refugees from Nazi Germany – Lang, Brecht and Eisler – is an example of the influence this generation of German exiles had on American culture.\n\n\"Hangmen Also Die!\" was Brecht's only script for a Hollywood film. The money he earned from writing the film enabled him to write \"The Visions of Simone Machard\", \"Schweik in the Second World War\" and an adaptation of Webster's \"The Duchess of Malfi\".\n\nIn 1942 Brecht's reluctance to help Carola Neher, who died in a gulag death camp in the USSR after being arrested during the 1936 purges, caused much controversy among Russian emigrants in the West.\n\nIn the years of the Cold War and \"Red Scare\", Brecht was blacklisted by movie studio bosses and interrogated by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Along with about 41 other Hollywood writers, directors, actors and producers, he was subpoenaed to appear before the HUAC in September 1947. Although he was one of 19 witnesses who declared that they would refuse to appear, Brecht eventually decided to testify. He later explained that he had followed the advice of attorneys and had not wanted to delay a planned trip to Europe. On 30 October 1947 Brecht testified that he had never been a member of the Communist Party. He made wry jokes throughout the proceedings, punctuating his inability to speak English well with continuous references to the translators present, who transformed his German statements into English ones unintelligible to himself. HUAC vice-chairman Karl Mundt thanked Brecht for his co-operation. The remaining witnesses, the so-called Hollywood Ten, refused to testify and were cited for contempt. Brecht's decision to appear before the committee led to criticism, including accusations of betrayal. The day after his testimony, on 31 October, Brecht returned to Europe.\n\nHe lived Zurich in Switzerland for a year. In February 1948 in Chur, Brecht staged an adaptation of Sophocles' \"Antigone\", based on a translation by Hölderlin. It was published under the title \"Antigonemodell 1948\", accompanied by an essay on the importance of creating a \"non-Aristotelian\" form of theatre. \n\nIn 1949 he moved to East Berlin and established his theatre company there, the Berliner Ensemble. He retained his Austrian nationality (granted in 1950) and overseas bank accounts from which he received valuable hard currency remittances. The copyrights on his writings were held by a Swiss company. At the time he drove a pre-war DKW car—a rare luxury in the austere divided capital.\n\nThough he was never a member of the Communist Party, Brecht had been schooled in Marxism by the dissident communist Karl Korsch. Korsch's version of the Marxist dialectic influenced Brecht greatly, both his aesthetic theory and theatrical practice. Brecht received the Stalin Peace Prize in 1954.\n\nBrecht wrote very few plays in his final years in East Berlin, none of them as famous as his previous works. He dedicated himself to directing plays and developing the talents of the next generation of young directors and dramaturgs, such as Manfred Wekwerth, Benno Besson and Carl Weber. At this time he wrote some of his most famous poems, including the \"Buckow Elegies\".\n\nAt first Brecht apparently supported the measures taken by the East German government against the uprising of 1953 in East Germany, which included the use of Soviet military force. In a letter from the day of the uprising to SED First Secretary Walter Ulbricht, Brecht wrote that: \"History will pay its respects to the revolutionary impatience of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. The great discussion [exchange] with the masses about the speed of socialist construction will lead to a viewing and safeguarding of the socialist achievements. At this moment I must assure you of my allegiance to the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.\"\n\nBrecht's subsequent commentary on those events, however, offered a very different assessment—in one of the poems in the \"Elegies\", \"Die Lösung\" (The Solution), a disillusioned Brecht writes a few months later:\n\nBrecht died on 14 August 1956 of a heart attack at the age of 58. He is buried in the Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery on Chausseestraße in the Mitte neighbourhood of Berlin, overlooked by the residence he shared with Helene Weigel.\n\nAccording to Stephen Parker, who reviewed Brecht's writings and unpublished medical records, Brecht contracted rheumatic fever as a child, which led to an enlarged heart, followed by lifelong chronic heart failure and Sydenham's chorea. A report of a radiograph taken of Brecht in 1951 describes a badly diseased heart, enlarged to the left with a protruding aortic knob and with seriously impaired pumping. Brecht's colleagues described him as being very nervous, and sometimes shaking his head or moving his hands erratically. This can be reasonably attributed to Sydenham's chorea, which is also associated with emotional lability, personality changes, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and hyperactivity, which matched Brecht's behavior. \"What is remarkable,\" wrote Parker, \"is his capacity to turn abject physical weakness into peerless artistic strength, arrhythmia into the rhythms of poetry, chorea into the choreography of drama.\"\n\nFrom his late twenties Brecht remained a lifelong committed Marxist who, in developing the combined theory and practice of his \"epic theatre\", synthesized and extended the experiments of Erwin Piscator and Vsevolod Meyerhold to explore the theatre as a forum for political ideas and the creation of a critical aesthetics of dialectical materialism.\n\nEpic Theatre proposed that a play should not cause the spectator to identify emotionally with the characters or action before him or her, but should instead provoke rational self-reflection and a critical view of the action on the stage. Brecht thought that the experience of a climactic catharsis of emotion left an audience complacent. Instead, he wanted his audiences to adopt a critical perspective in order to recognise social injustice and exploitation and to be moved to go forth from the theatre and effect change in the world outside. For this purpose, Brecht employed the use of techniques that remind the spectator that the play is a representation of reality and not reality itself. By highlighting the constructed nature of the theatrical event, Brecht hoped to communicate that the audience's reality was equally constructed and, as such, was changeable.\n\nBrecht's modernist concern with drama-as-a-medium led to his refinement of the \"epic form\" of the drama. This dramatic form is related to similar modernist innovations in other arts, including the strategy of divergent chapters in James Joyce's novel \"Ulysses\", Sergei Eisenstein's evolution of a constructivist \"montage\" in the cinema, and Picasso's introduction of cubist \"collage\" in the visual arts.\n\nOne of Brecht's most important principles was what he called the \"Verfremdungseffekt\" (translated as \"defamiliarization effect\", \"distancing effect\", or \"estrangement effect\", and often mistranslated as \"alienation effect\"). This involved, Brecht wrote, \"stripping the event of its self-evident, familiar, obvious quality and creating a sense of astonishment and curiosity about them\". To this end, Brecht employed techniques such as the actor's direct address to the audience, harsh and bright stage lighting, the use of songs to interrupt the action, explanatory placards, the transposition of text to the third person or past tense in rehearsals, and speaking the stage directions out loud.\n\nIn contrast to many other avant-garde approaches, however, Brecht had no desire to destroy art as an institution; rather, he hoped to \"re-function\" the theatre to a new social use. In this regard he was a vital participant in the aesthetic debates of his era—particularly over the \"high art/popular culture\" dichotomy—vying with the likes of Adorno, Lukács, Ernst Bloch, and developing a close friendship with Benjamin. Brechtian theatre articulated popular themes and forms with avant-garde formal experimentation to create a modernist realism that stood in sharp contrast both to its psychological and socialist varieties. \"Brecht's work is the most important and original in European drama since Ibsen and Strindberg,\" Raymond Williams argues, while Peter Bürger dubs him \"the most important materialist writer of our time.\"\n\nBrecht was also influenced by Chinese theatre, and used its aesthetic as an argument for \"Verfremdungseffekt\". Brecht believed, \"Traditional Chinese acting also knows the alienation [sic] effect, and applies it most subtly... The [Chinese] performer portrays incidents of utmost passion, but without his delivery becoming heated.\" Brecht attended a Chinese opera performance and was introduced to the famous Chinese opera performer Mei Lanfang in 1935. However, Brecht was sure to distinguish between Epic and Chinese theatre. He recognized that the Chinese style was not a \"transportable piece of technique,\" and that Epic theatre sought to historicize and address social and political issues.\n\nBrecht used his poetry to criticize European culture, including Nazis, and the German bourgeoisie. Brecht's poetry is marked by the effects of the First and Second World Wars. Many of the poems take a Marxist outlook.\n\nThroughout his theatric production, poems are incorporated into this plays with music. In 1951, Brecht issued a recantation of his apparent suppression of poetry in his plays with a note titled \"On Poetry and Virtuosity\". He writes:\nWe shall not need to speak of a play's poetry ... something that seemed relatively unimportant in the immediate past. It seemed not only unimportant, but misleading, and the reason was not that the poetic element had been sufficiently developed and observed, but that reality had been tampered with in its name ... we had to speak of a truth as distinct from poetry ... we have given up examining works of art from their poetic or artistic aspect, and got satisfaction from theatrical works that have no sort of poetic appeal ... Such works and performances may have some effect, but it can hardly be a profound one, not even politically. For it is a peculiarity of the theatrical medium that it communicates awarenesses and impulses in the form of pleasure: the depth of the pleasure and the impulse will correspond to the depth of the pleasure.\n\nBrecht's most influential poetry is featured in his \"Manual of Piety (Devotions)\", establishing him as a noted poet.\n\nBrecht's widow, the actress Helene Weigel, continued to manage the Berliner Ensemble until her death in 1971; it was primarily devoted to performing Brecht's plays.\n\nBesides being an influential dramatist and poet, some scholars have stressed the significance of Brecht's original contributions in political and social philosophy.\n\nBrecht's collaborations with Kurt Weill have had some influence in rock music. The \"Alabama Song\" for example, originally published as a poem in Brecht's \"Hauspostille\" (1927) and set to music by Weill in \"Mahagonny\", has been recorded by The Doors, on their self-titled debut album, as well as by David Bowie and various other bands and performers since the 1960s.\n\nBrecht's son, Stefan Brecht, became a poet and theatre critic interested in New York's avant-garde theatre.\n\n\nCollective and collaborative working methods were inherent to Brecht's approach, as Fredric Jameson (among others) stresses. Jameson describes the creator of the work not as Brecht the individual, but rather as 'Brecht': a collective subject that \"certainly seemed to have a distinctive style (the one we now call 'Brechtian') but was no longer personal in the bourgeois or individualistic sense.\" During the course of his career, Brecht sustained many long-lasting creative relationships with other writers, composers, scenographers, directors, dramaturgs and actors; the list includes: Elisabeth Hauptmann, Margarete Steffin, Ruth Berlau, Slatan Dudow, Kurt Weill, Hanns Eisler, Paul Dessau, Caspar Neher, Teo Otto, Karl von Appen, Ernst Busch, Lotte Lenya, Peter Lorre, Therese Giehse, Angelika Hurwicz, Carola Neher and Helene Weigel herself. This is \"theatre as collective experiment [...] as something radically different from theatre as expression or as experience.\"\n\n\nEntries show: \"English-language translation of title\" (\"German-language title\") [year written] / [year first produced]\n\nBrecht wrote hundreds of poems throughout his life. He began writing poetry as a young boy, and his first poems were published in 1914. His poetry was influenced by folk-ballads, French \"chansons\", and the poetry of Rimbaud and Villon.\n\nSome of Brecht's poems\n\n\n\n\n"}

Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of Guillaume de Machaut. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged.

{"id": "658994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=658994", "title": "Conflict (narrative)", "text": "Conflict (narrative)\n\nIn works of narrative, conflict is the challenge main characters need to solve to achieve their goals.\n\nTraditionally, conflict is a major literary element that creates challenges in a story by adding uncertainty to if the goal would be achieved. A narrative is not limited to a single conflict. While conflicts may not always resolve in narrative, the resolution of a conflict creates closure or fulfillment, which may or may not occur at a story's end.\n\nConflict in literature refers to the different drives of the characters or forces involved. Conflict may be internal or external—that is, it may occur within a character's mind or between a character and exterior forces, (or point(s) of view). Conflict is most visible between two or more characters, usually a protagonist and an antagonist/enemy/villain, but can occur in many different forms. A character may as easily find himself or herself in conflict with a natural force, such as an animal or a weather event, like a hurricane. The literary purpose of conflict is to create tension in the story, making readers more interested by leaving them uncertain which of the characters or forces will prevail.\n\nThere may be multiple points of conflict in a single story, as characters may have more than one desire or may struggle against more than one opposing force. When a conflict is resolved and the reader discovers which force or character succeeds, it creates a sense of closure. Conflicts may resolve at any point in a story, particularly where more than one conflict exists, but stories do not always resolve every conflict. If a story ends without resolving the main or major conflict(s), it is said to have an \"open\" ending. Open endings, which can serve to ask the reader to consider the conflict more personally, may not satisfy them, but obvious conflict resolution may also leave readers disappointed in the story.\n\nThe basic types of conflict in fiction have been commonly codified as \"man against man\", \"man against nature\", and \"man against self.\"\n\nAlthough frequently cited, these three types of conflict are not universally accepted. Ayn Rand, for instance, argued that \"man against nature\" is not a conflict because nature has no free will and thus can make no choices. Sometimes a fourth basic conflict is described, \"man against society\". Some of the other types of conflict referenced include \"man against machine\" (\"The Terminator\", \"Brave New World\"), \"man against fate\" (\"Slaughterhouse Five\"), \"man against the supernatural\" (\"The Shining\") and \"man against God\" (\"A Canticle for Leibowitz\").\n\n\"Man against man\" conflict involves stories where characters are against each other. This is an external conflict. The conflict may be direct opposition, as in a gunfight or a robbery, or it may be a more subtle conflict between the desires of two or more characters, as in a romance or a family epic. This type of conflict is very common in traditional literature, fairy tales and myths. One example of the \"man against man\" conflict is the relationship struggles between the protagonist and the antagonist stepfather in \"This Boy's Life\". Other examples include Dorothy's struggles with the Wicked Witch of the West in \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" and Tom Sawyer's confrontation with Injun Joe in \"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\".\n\n\"Man against nature\" conflict is an external struggle positioning the hero against an animal or a force of nature, such as a storm or tornado or snow. The \"man against nature\" conflict is central to Ernest Hemingway's \"The Old Man and the Sea\", where the protagonist contends against a marlin. It is also common in adventure stories, including \"Robinson Crusoe. Man vs. Wild\" not only takes its name from this conflict, but it is also a great example, featuring Bear Grylls and his attempts to keep nature at bay.\n\nWith \"man against self\" conflict, the struggle is internal. A character must overcome her/his own nature or make a choice between two or more paths—good and evil; logic and emotion. A serious example of \"man against himself\" is offered by Hubert Selby Jr.'s 1978 novel \"Requiem for a Dream\", which centers around stories of addiction. In the novel \"Fight Club\" by Chuck Palahniuk, published in 1994, as well as in its 1999 film adaptation, the unnamed protagonist struggles against himself in what is revealed to be a case of dissociative identity disorder. \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" also focuses on internal conflict, as the titular character deals with her own neuroses and self-doubts.\n\nWhere man stands against a man-made institution (such as slavery or bullying), \"man against man\" conflict may shade into \"man against society\". In such stories, characters are forced to make moral choices or frustrated by social rules in meeting their own goals. \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and \"Fahrenheit 451\" are examples of \"man against society\" conflicts. So is \"Charlotte's Web\", in which the pig Wilbur fights for his survival against a society that raises pigs for food.\n\nAs with other literary terms, these have come about gradually as descriptions of common narrative structures. Conflict was first described in ancient Greek literature as the \"agon\", or central contest in tragedy. According to Aristotle, in order to hold the interest, the hero must have a \"single\" conflict. The agon, or act of conflict, involves the protagonist (the \"first fighter\") and the antagonist (a more recent term), corresponding to the hero and villain. The outcome of the contest cannot be known in advance, and according to later critics such as Plutarch, the hero's struggle should be ennobling.\n\nEven in modern non-dramatic literature, critics have observed that the agon is the central unit of the plot. The easier it is for the protagonist to triumph, the less value there is in the drama. In internal and external conflict alike, the antagonist must act upon the protagonist and must seem at first to overmatch him or her. For example, in William Faulkner's \"The Bear\", nature might be the antagonist. Even though it is an abstraction, natural creatures and the scenery oppose and resist the protagonist. In the same story, the young boy's doubts about himself provide an internal conflict, and they seem to overwhelm him.\n\nSimilarly, when godlike characters enter (e.g. Superman), correspondingly great villains have to be created, or natural weaknesses have to be invented, to allow the narrative to have drama. Alternatively, scenarios could be devised in which the character's godlike powers are constrained by some sort of code, or their respective antagonist.\n\n\n"}

When applied to cultural heritage this activity is generally undertaken by a conservator-restorer.\nGlass was discovered in the third millennium B.C.E. and is still a relatively new material. The art of glassworking did not occur until long after metalwork or pottery. The act of conservation and restoration strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. Water is the primary cause of deterioration in glass materials.<ref name= \"Newton/Davison\"></ref>\n\nWeathering\n\nWeathering is a broad definition for any form of deterioration which appears on the surface of the glass and is caused by exposure to adverse conditions. Below are the seven typical forms of weathering.\n\n\"Dulling\" is the simplest form of weathering. It occurs when glass loses its clarity and transparency and becomes translucent.\n\n\"Strain cracking\" describes the presence of minuscule cracks running through the glass in all directions, giving it a sugary appearance and causing the glass to disintegrate.\n\n\"Frosting\"\n\n\"Iridescence\" is caused by continuous flaking of a glass surface causing a multi-colored sheen to appear on the surface of formerly transparent glass.\n\n\"Milky\"\n\n\"Enamel-like\"\n\nDevitrification\nDevitrification is the process of converting glass into a crystalline substance by heating it to a temperature just below its melting point then cooled. By doing this, the randomly situated molecules in the glass, when cooled, will attempt to settle in a less random and more crystalline form. This technique is used to create an opaque appearance in the glass. Due to the high level of stress this technique places on the glass, it may cause the glass to deteriorate. For more information on devitrification as an artistic technique, see the main article above.\n\nThe term \"devitrification\" is used by archaeologists and art historians to refer to a glass object which has lost it vitreous nature, giving the glass a weathered appearance. This is first caused by the loss of alkali then followed by the loss of other materials of the glass, and finally the creation of a silica gel, indicating the change in the glass's chemical composition.\n\nCrizzling\nAtmospheric deterioration, commonly referred to as crizzling, weeping or glass disease is primarily caused by a chemical imbalance in specific types of glass, though it can occur in almost any glass. This form of deterioration is a basic defect in glass caused by incorrect proportions of ingredients, particularly an excess of alkali in the glass composite. Crizzling occurs in 5 main stages.\n\n\"Stage One\"\n\n\"Stage Two\"\n\n\"Stage Three\"\n\n\"Stage Four\"\n\n\"Stage Five\"\n\nBrittleness\n\nStorage and handling\n\nIn France, conservators specialized in earthenware and glassware are trained at the Institut National du Patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage). Their mission is to intervene when heritage resources are threatened or deteriorated for several reasons. The conservator prevents works of art from disappearing or loses its purpose whilst analyzing the complex stage of its material history and the cause of alteration.\n\nMuseum Practices\n\n\n"}

Established by private cultural initiatives that continue the work of American benefactors, the center provides hands-on programs for people to experience archaeological excavation of Native American sites.\n\nCrow Canyon is the result of work in experiential and hands-on education started in 1967 by Edward F. Berger, a history teacher with the Cherry Creek Schools near Denver, Colorado. Berger brought students to SW Colorado and involved them in building community and programs that increased motivation and accelerated learning. Because of the rich prehistoric cultural base in the area, archaeology was added to the curricula and Berger, with the help of Dr. Art Rohn (then of Wichita State University) supported Rohn’s graduate students to teach and supervise high school students doing original research excavating ancient pueblo sites. The development of this arrangement with academic scholars and the involvement and teaching of high school age students is believed to be first of its kind.\n\nIn 1972, Berger began working through the University of Northern Colorado on a doctoral program designed to create and field test experiential, motivational, and accelerated learning programs. These programs were interdisciplinary, supplemental high school credit courses . In 1972, Berger wrote the non-profit corporation Crow Canyon operates under today. Then it was called I-S Education Programs. \nIn 1974, Berger purchased 80 acres of land west of Cortez, Colorado on Crow Canyon and began designing a year round campus . He earned his Ed.D. in 1975. His research into learning continued and from 1975 until 1986, Berger, now joined by his wife Joanne, pioneered new and effective learning and teaching techniques. The challenge was taking a student from zero knowledge about SW history and archaeology to working alongside of an academic scholar – and being effective – in two days. The accelerated learning techniques he developed made this possible.\n\nThe original campus facilities were basic, but “better than tents.” Educational programs were expanded to age groups 10 – 80 years of age. Dr. Ron Gould was the first staff archaeologist and teacher. Significant involvement with the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe resulted in special Native American programs on campus and deep and lasting relationships with Ute Neighbors. Survey work in the areas west of the campus resulted in the identification and naming of sites (Smithsonian Numbers). Many bear the names of the schools across the US whose students identified them.\n\nBy the early 80s, Crow Canyon was well known for its educational programs and its archaeological research. The Bergers needed capital to improve the campus and to free them of 24/7/365 responsibility. They learned of the Foundation for Illinois Archaeology and its fledgling program at Kampsville, Illinois. A young and dynamic man, Clark Hinsdale, was building an educational component. Bergers contacted professor Struever at Northwestern University who headed the FIA. Struever was a successful fundraiser and promoter. By 1983, negations resulted in a merger of the two non-profit corporations note that Non-profit corporations are not bought and sold. FIA then changed its name to The Center for American Archaeology (at Northwestern University). CAA paid off I-SEP’s debts and Bergers donated 70 acres of land. A new lodge designed to house 40 students was built. A lab building was provided. Additional research archaeologists were hired, and Bergers identified two major sites for research: Sand Canyon Pueblo, and the Duckfoot Site. Southwest archaeologists coordinated the research design and standards, academic supervision, and selection of staff archaeologists.\n\nIn the spring of 1986, knowing that the center was on firm ground, Jo and Ed Berger resigned their positions of executive director and associate director respectively. They were able to pick their successor, Ian Sandy Thompson. So much had been accomplished and the model that drives Crow Canyon today had been tested and functioning for almost 18 years.\n\nSince its foundation, the mission of Crow Canyon has been to preserve and protect the rich heritage of the ancient Pueblo Indians (or Anasazi) of the American Southwest[3] and to educate the public of the need to preserve and protect archaeological resources. Archaeological research has been conducted in the Mesa Verde region with the goal of teaching archaeology through hands-on experience. Students and teachers alike are invited to participate in research in the archaeological camp.\n\nKey initiatives include education, research, and cultural programs.

Local terms for a European ethics committee include:\n\nIn the United States, an ethics committee is usually known as an institutional review board and is dedicated to overseeing the rights and well-being of research subjects participating in scientific studies in the US. Similarly in Canada, the committee is called a Research Ethics Board (REB).\n\nIn Australia, an ethics committee in medical research refers to a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC).\n\nOne of the most fundamental ethical principles in human experimentation is that the experimenter should not subject the participants in the experiment to any procedure they would not be willing to undertake themselves. This idea was first codified in the Nuremberg Code in 1947, which was a result of the trials of Nazi doctors at the Nuremberg trials accused of murdering and torturing victims in valueless experiments. Several of these doctors were hanged. Point five of the Nuremberg Code requires that no experiment should be conducted that is dangerous to the subjects unless the experimenters themselves also take part. The Nuremberg Code has influenced medical experiment codes of practice around the world, as has the exposure of experiments that have since failed to follow it such as the notorious Tuskegee syphilis experiment.\n\nAnother ethical principle is that volunteers must stand to gain some benefit from the research, even if that is only a remote future possibility of treatment being found for a disease that they only have a small chance of contracting. Tests on experimental drugs are sometimes conducted on sufferers of an untreatable condition. If the researcher does not have that condition then there can be no possible benefit to them personally. For instance, Ronald C. Desrosiers in responding to why he did not test an AIDS vaccine he was developing on himself said that he was not at risk of AIDS so could not possibly benefit.\n\nAn important element of an ethics committee's oversight is to ensure that informed consent of the subjects has been given. Informed consent is the principle that the volunteers in the experiment should fully understand the procedure that is going to take place, be aware of all the risks involved, and give their consent to taking part in the experiment beforehand. The principle of informed consent was first enacted in the U.S. Army's research into Yellow fever in Cuba in 1901. However, there was no general or official guidance at this time. That remained the case until the yellow fever program was referenced in the drafting of the Nuremberg Code. This was further developed in the Declaration of Helsinki in 1964 by the World Medical Association which has since become the foundation for ethics committees' guidelines.\n\nThe convening of ethics committees to approve the research protocol in human experiments was first written into international guidelines in the first revision to the Declaration of Helsinki (Helsinki II, 1975). A controversy arose over the fourth revision (1996) concerning placebo trials in developing countries. It was claimed that US trials of the anti-HIV drug zidovudine in India was in breach of this requirement. This led the US Food and Drug Administration to cease incorporating new revisions of Helsinki and refer instead to the 1989 revision.\n\nEthics committees are also made a requirement in \"International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects\", produced by the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS), a body set up by the World Health Organization. First published in 1993, the CIOMS guidelines have no legal force but they have been influential in the drafting of national regulations for ethics committees. The COIMS guidelines are focused on practice in developing countries.\n\n"}
{"id": "2610792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2610792", "title": "Expectancy violations theory", "text": "Expectancy violations theory\n\nExpectancy violations theory (EVT) is a theory of communication that analyzes how individuals respond to unanticipated violations of social norms and expectations. The theory was proposed by Judee K. Burgoon in the late 1970s and continued through the 1980s and 1990s as \"nonverbal expectancy violations theory\", based on Burgoon's research studying proxemics. Burgoon's work initially analyzed individuals' allowances and expectations of personal distance and how responses to personal distance violations were influenced by the level of liking and relationship to the violators. The theory was later changed to its current name when other researchers began to focus on violations of social behavior expectations beyond nonverbal communication.\n\nThis theory sees communication as an exchange of behaviors, where one individual's behavior can be used to violate the expectations of another. Participants in communication will perceive the exchange either positively or negatively, depending upon an existing personal relationship or how favorably the violation is perceived. Violations of expectancies cause arousal and compel the recipient to initiate a series of cognitive appraisals of the violation. The theory predicts that expectancies influence the outcome of the communication interaction as either positive or negative and predicts that positive violations increase the attraction of the violator and negative violations decrease the attraction of the violator.\n\nBeyond proxemics and examining how people interpret violations in many given communicative contexts, EVT also makes specific predictions about individuals' reaction to given expectation violations: individuals reciprocate or match someone's unexpected behavior, and they also compensate or counteract by doing the opposite of the communicator's behavior.\n\nThe expectancy violations theory examines three main components in interpersonal communication situations: Expectancies, communicator reward valence, and violation valence.\n\nExpectancy refers to what an individual anticipates will happen in a given situation. Expectancies are primarily based upon social norms and specific characteristics and idiosyncrasies of the communicators.\n\nBurgoon (1978) notes that people do not view others' behaviors as random. Rather, they have various expectations of how others should think and behave. EVT proposes that observation and interaction with others leads to expectancies. The two types of expectancies noted are predictive and prescriptive. Predictive expectations are \"behaviors we expect to see because they are the most typical,\" (Houser, 2005) and vary across cultures. They let people know what to expect based upon what typically occurs within the context of a particular environment and relationship. For example, a husband and wife may have an evening routine in which the husband always washes the dishes. If he were to ignore the dirty dishes one night, this might be seen as a predictive discrepancy. Prescriptive expectations, on the other hand, are based upon \"beliefs about what behaviors should be performed\" and \"what is needed and desired\" (Houser, 2005). If a person walks into a police department to report a crime, the person will have an expectation that the police will file a report and follow up with an investigation.\n\nWhen the theory was first proposed, EVT identified three factors which influence a person's expectations: Interactant variables, environmental variables, and variables related to the nature of the interaction. Interactant variables are the traits of those persons involved in the communication, such as sex, attractiveness, race, culture, status, and age. Environmental variables include the amount of space available and the nature of the territory surrounding the interaction. Interaction variables include social norms, purpose of the interaction, and formality of the situation.\n\nThese factors later evolved into communicator characteristics, relational characteristics, and context. Communicator characteristics include personal features such as an individual's appearance, personality and communication style. It also includes factors such as age, sex and ethnic background. Relational characteristics refer to factors such as similarity, familiarity, status and liking. The type of relationship one individual shares within another (e.g. romantic, business or platonic), the previous experiences shared between the individuals, and how close they are with one another are also relational characteristics that influence expectations. Context encompasses both environment and interaction characteristics. Communicator characteristics lead to distinctions between males and females in assessing the extent to which their nonverbal expressions of power and dominance effect immediacy behaviors. Immediacy cues such as conversational distance, lean, body orientation, gaze, and touch may differ between the genders as they create psychological closeness or distance between the interactants.\n\nBehavioural expectations may also shift depending on the environment one is experiencing. For example, a visit to a church will produce different expectations than a social function. The expected violations will therefore be altered. Similarly, expectations differ based on culture. In Europe, one may expect to be greeted with three kisses on alternating cheeks, but this is not the case in the United States.\n\nThe communicator reward valence is an evaluation one makes about the person who committed a violation of expectancy. Em Griffin summarizes the concept behind Communicator Reward Valence as \"the sum of positive and negative attributes brought to the encounter plus the potential to reward or punish in the future\". The social exchange theory explains that individuals seek to reward some and seek to avoid punishing others. When one individual interacts with another, Burgoon believes he or she will assess the \"positive and negative attributes that person brings to the encounter\". If the person has the ability to reward or punish the receiver in the future, then the person has a positive reward valence. Rewards simply refer to the person's ability to provide a want or need. The term 'communicator reward valence' is used to describe the results of this assessment. For example, people will feel encouraged during conversation when the listener is nodding, making eye contact, and responding actively. Conversely, if the listener is avoiding eye contact, yawning, and texting, it is implied they have no interest in the interaction and the speaker may feel violated.\n\nWhen examining the context, relationship, and communicator's characteristics in a given encounter, individuals will arrive at an expectation for how that person should behave. Changing even one of these expectancy variables may lead to a different expectation.\n\nBehavior violations arouse and distract, calling attention to the qualities of the violator and the relationship between the interactants. A key component of EVT is the notion of violation valence, or the association the receiver places on the behavior violation. A violatee's response to an expectancy violation can be positive or negative, and is dependent on two conditions: positive or negative interpretation of the behavior and the nature (rewardingness) of the violator. Rewardingness of the violator is evaluated through many categories – attractiveness, prestige, ability to provide resources, or associated relationship. For instance, a violation of one's personal distance might have more positive valence if committed by a wealthy, powerful, physically appealing member of the opposite sex than a filthy, poor, homeless person with foul breath. The evaluation of the violation is based upon the relationship between the particular behavior and the valence of the actor. A person's preinteractional expectancies, especially\npersonal attributes, may cause a perceiver to evaluate the communication behavior\nof a target differently in terms of assigning positive and negative valenced expectancies.\n\nAnother perspective of violation valence is that the perceived positive or negative value assigned to a breach of expectations is inconsequential of who the violator is. This perspective places much greater weight on the act of the breach itself than the violator. The difference between the negative violation and the negative confirmation do not appear significant. Dis-confirmations tend to intensify the outcomes, especially in the positive violation condition.\n\nExpectancy violations refer to actions which are noticeably discrepant from an expectancy and are classified as outside the range of expectancy. The term 'arousal value' is used to describe the consequences of deviations from expectations. When individuals' expectations are violated, their interests or attentions are aroused.\n\nWhen arousal occurs, one's interest or attention to the deviation increases, resulting in less attention paid to the message and more attention to the source of the arousal. There are two kinds of arousals. Cognitive arousal is an idea that people will be mentally aware of the violation. Physical occurs when people have body actions and behaviors in response to the deviations from their expectations.\n\nThe occurrence of arousal is aligned with threats. Burgoon introduced the term \"threat threshold\" to explain that people have different levels of tolerance about distant violations. The threat threshold is high when people feel good even if they keep a very close distance with the violator, whereas people with low threat threshold will be sensitive and uncomfortable about the closeness of distance with the violator.\n\nAfter assessing expectancy, violation valence, and communicator reward valence of a given situation, it becomes possible to make rather specific predictions about whether the individual who perceived the violation will reciprocate or compensate the behavior in question. Guerrero (1996) and Burgoon (2000) noticed that predictable patterns develop when considering reward valence and violation valence together. Specifically, if the violation valence is perceived as positive and the communicator reward valence is also perceived as positive, the theory predicts individuals will reciprocate the positive behavior. For example, your boss gives you a big smile after you have given a presentation. Guerrero and Burgoon would predict that you would smile in return. Similarly, if you perceive the violation valence as negative and perceive the communicator reward valence as negative, the theory again predicts that you reciprocate the negative behavior. Thus, if a disliked coworker is grouchy and unpleasant towards you, you will likely reciprocate and be unpleasant in return.\n\nConversely, if one perceives a negative violation valence but views the communicator reward valence as positive, it is likely that the person will compensate for his or her partner's negative behavior. For example, one day your boss appears sullen and throws a stack of papers in front of you. Rather than grunt back, EVT predicts that you will compensate for your boss' negativity, perhaps by asking if everything is OK (Guerrero & Burgoon, 1996). More difficult to predict, however, is the situation in which a person who is viewed unfavorably violates another with positive behavior. In this situation, the receiver may reciprocate, giving the person the \"benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nThe assumptions discussed thus far can be summarized into six major propositions posited by Expectancy Violations Theory:\n\n\nExpectancy violations theory builds upon a number of communication axioms. EVT assumes that humans have two competing needs: A need for personal space and a need for affiliation. Specifically, humans all need a certain amount of personal space, also referred to as distance or privacy. People also desire a certain amount of closeness with others, or affiliation. EVT seeks to explain 'personal space', and the meanings that are formed when expectations of appropriate personal space are infringed or violated.\n\nAnother feature of personal space is territoriality. Territoriality refers to behavior which \"is characterized by identification with a geographic area in a way that indicates ownership\" (Hall, 1966). In humans, territoriality refers to an individual's sense of ownership over physical items, space, objects or ideas, and defensive behavior in response to territorial invasions. Territoriality involves three territory types: Primary territories, secondary territories and public territories. Primary territories are considered exclusive to an individual. Secondary territories are objects, spaces or places which \"can be claimed temporarily\" (Hall, 1966), but are neither central to the individual's life nor are exclusively owned. Public territories are \"available to almost anyone for temporary ownership\". Territoriality is frequently accompanied by prevention and reaction. When an individual perceives one of their needs has been compromised, EVT predicts that they will react. For instance, when an offensive violation occurs, the individual tends to react as though protecting their territory.\n\nEVT offers an opportunity to study how individuals communicate through personal space. This part of the theory explains the notion of \"personal space\" and our reactions to others who appear to \"violate\" our sense of personal space. What we define as personal space, however, varies from culture to culture and from person to person. The \"success\" or \"failure\" of violations are linked to perceived attraction, credibility, influence and involvement. The context and purpose of interaction are relevant, as are the communicator characteristics of gender, relationships, status, social class, ethnicity and culture. When it comes to different interactions between people, what each person expects out of the interaction will influence their individual willingness to risk violation. If a person feels comfortable in a situation, they are more likely to risk violation, and in turn will be rewarded for it.\n\nIntroduced by Edward Hall in 1966, Proxemics deals with the amount of distance between people as they interact with one another. Spatial distance during an interaction can be an indication of what type of relationship exists between the people involved.\n\nThere are 4 different personal zones defined by Hall. These zones include:\n\nMany different cultures are influenced by Proxemics in different ways and respond differently to the same situation. In some cultures, those who have not formed close relationships may greet each other with kisses on the cheek, engaging one another well within the intimate range of proxemics. In other cultures, a custom greeting is a handshake which maintains a physical separation but is well within personal distance. Across the Proxemic Zones, actions can be interpreted differently among different cultures. For example, Japanese people do not address others by their first names unless they have been given permission. Calling someone by their first name in Japan without permission is considered an insult. In the Japanese culture, they address people using their last name and 'san', which is equivalent to 'Mr.','Mrs.' and 'Ms.' in the English language. The way Japanese people address each other is an example of a verbal Proxemic zone. A Japanese person allowing another to call them by their first name is an example of intimate distance, because this is a privilege extended only someone very close to them.\n\nIt is important to note that EVT can apply to both non-relational interaction and close relationships. In 1998, more than twenty years after the theory was first published, several studies were conducted to catalog the types of expectancy violations commonly found in close relationships. Expectations with friends formulate over time and are usually brought together by a series of observations of behavior and predictions on how that friend will act in the future. When these expectations are violated, it often can be damaging and dangerous for a close friendship. It can cause an end to the friendship and bring a strong negative experience in that person's life. After time and experiences with that friend we might suspect them to act consistently around me in the way they have always acted, that is until a violation to this expectation takes place. For example, when they begin “breaking promises or even acting in an inauthentic manner to impress others, can have aversive consequences for close relationships” (Cohen 2010). The fact is, we expect our friends to act in a social manner where they are adhere to all of our personal rules we set in our minds. That includes being nice, kind, considerate, and refraining from any comment that puts another down. This is a part of the personal rules we set within ourselves with a personal friendship, that is until we are in a different setting with that individual and they are around different people and the rules are broken. While this might be an offense in one’s eyes, it may not be offensive in the others. Each negative experience can deteriorate the relationship and allow more experiences where expectations are continually violated until the relationship is dissolved. Cohen said “the more that a friendship is voluntary, easily replaceable, and disconnected from external pressures to continue, the more vulnerable it is to expectancy violation damage” (Cohen, 2010). Someone will always look for the better option if a negative experience has taken place. The more you are invested in a friendship with someone the stronger the effect will have on the individual when expectations are violated. There is also an interesting perspective of expectation violation when you throw gender into the picture. A friend that shares the same sex as you usually has a completely different feel to the relationship than a friendship with members of the opposite sex. Women are generally less tolerant with members of the opposite sex when violations have taken place. Relationships over time, whether it be with the same sex or not, tend to fail when the other will fall away from the behaviors and norms that the other is used to. This can be shown with hostile attitudes, sharp comments, distancing away from the other, etc. Both parties are also capable of violating each other's expectations at the same time. It is not just one person in the relationship that perceives behavior as unusual. One can respond to a violation with another social violation, leaving the friendship in confusion of direction it is going. \n\nIn later review of the studies, the \"support or confirmation\" category was inserted into \"acts of devotion\" and included another category, \"uncharacteristic social behavior\". These are acts that aren't relational but are unexpected, such as a quiet person raising his or her voice.\n\nIn terms of the response to expectancy violations, the sensitivity of expectancy violations varies from genders. Research found that women are less tolerant than men when their expectation are violated by negative behaviors, regardless of the types of violations such as dishonesty and immorality.\n\nExpectancy violations happen frequently in romantic relationships. In relationships there is an unspoken expectation when interacting and that is the significant other will give their full undivided attention when in the presence of their significant other. As the new generation evolves we can see the face to face contact has changed. Unfortunately, with the access use of phones and social media the attention of individuals has shifted to their devices and continues to become worse. With the access to many mobile devices there has been an increase of lack of communication face to face. This has made it difficult for some relationships to grow and or has created conflict because the expectation of attention has been shifted. \"Individuals expect conversational partners to be moderately involved in an interaction (Burgoon, Newton, Walther, & Baesler, 1989). Within existing relationships, partners rely on one another to show interest and immediacy in interactions (White, 2008). However, the presence of cell phones and the expectation to be constantly available (Ling, 2012) impacts partners' abilities to give full attention to one another\" (Miller-Ott, A., & Kelly, L. 2015).\n\nWhen romantic partners spend time together, both prefer gaining attention, intimacy, and feeling a close connection with each other. However, the usage of cell phones acts as a distractive behavior that drives romantic partner's attention to absent elements. Although romantic partners are more likely to be viewed as high reward communicators, their cell phone usage behaviors will be evaluated as negative in certain conditions and contexts.\n\nRegardless of where the romantic relationship takes place, people are likely to have negative valence about cell phone usage if their demand of attention and intimacy are violated. The negative behaviors include texting, viewing news and playing games. In addition, large quantity of annoying cell phone usage during the date has great impact on romantic partner's negative valence towards the violated behaviors. However, Miller-Ott and Kelly found that small amount of cell phone usage during date is acceptable, such as responding to a text message and quickly bringing attentiveness back to the date partner. The same behavior in different occasions and contexts is viewed differently in terms of the degree of valence. Research found that same behavior is viewed as more negative in a restaurant than at home. Since people are more likely to have higher expectations for undivided attention during formal contexts, using cell phone in formal dates will more negatively violate partner's expectations. Divided attention is acceptable in casual contexts – therefore, the degree of expectancy violations is low under a hanging out context.\n\nCell phone usage behaviors that do not contradict intimate moment are viewed as positive violations, including sharing interesting messages and playing online games together. People have less negative valence on cell phone usage if they gain more reward from the behaviors.\n\nResearch also found the most common response to the violated cell phone usage is to do nothing. However, people have different reactions to the violations under different stages of romantic relationships. In the early stage of dating, people are more likely to respond by indirect messages and silence. While there are direct verbal responses when expectations are violated in established relationships.\n\nSexual resistance is viewed as a typical expectancy violation in romantic relationships. In 2003, Bevan used EVT to evaluate the impact of sexual resistance on close relationships. The research focused on two considerations: relational contexts and directness of the messages.\n\nThe research concluded that people who are resisted in a romantic relationship perceived the violation of sexual resistance as more negative and unexpected than those resisted in a regular cross-sex friendship. The reason might because romantic partners believe that they have clearer and deeper understanding of each other's expectations and degree of acceptance and tolerance. When it comes to message directness of sexual resistance, although the study did not find any significant difference of levels of violation valence and expectedness between direct and indirect messages, direct sexual resistance messages in close relationships proved to be more relationally important than indirect messages. Therefore, direct sexual resistance messages will be a harmful factor that affects the continuity of a romantic relationship.\n\nAs has previously been addressed, EVT has evolved tremendously over the years, expanding beyond its original induction when it focused on FtF communication and proxemics. The advancement of information and communications technology has provided tools for expressing oneself and conveying messages beyond just typing in text. As already discussed, arousal can divert one's attention or interest from a message\nto the source of the arousal. Virtual realities\ncreated online through computer-mediated communication, especially those which evoke\nstrong visual presence through media, can increase arousal levels, such as those\nwith high violent or sexual content. Just\nas people may use television viewing to increase or decrease arousal levels, people\nmay use media in online communication to increase or decrease arousal levels. People may interact with others online by assuming\nthe identities of avatars which may take on completely different, alternate personalities.\nThe differences in perceived intimateness, co-presence, and emotionally-based trust can very significantly between avatar communication and other communication modalities such as text chat, audio, and audio-visual. The media options available to users when communicating\nwith others online present a host of potential expectancy violations unique to CMC.\n\nThe introduction of social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as dating social networks such as Match.com and eHarmony, has greatly contributed to the increased use of computer-mediated communication (CMC) which now offers a context for studying communication devoid of nonverbal information. Though these media are relatively new, they have been in existence long enough for users to have developed norms and expectations about appropriate behaviors in the online world. However, there has been a lag by researchers to study and understand these new established norms, which makes CMC rich with heuristic possibilities from a communications theory perspective.\n\nRamirez and Wang studied the occurrence and timing of modality switching, or shifts from online communication to FtF interaction, from the perspective of EVT. Their research documented inconsistent findings which revealed in some instances relationships were enhanced and in others they were dampened, indicating the expectations, evaluations, and outcomes associated with initial modality switches varied amongst individuals. Additionally, studies have found that when individuals who meet online meet face-to-face for the first time, the length of time spent communicating online can determine whether individuals will rate physical characteristics of each other positively or negatively. Unlike FtF communication, CMC allows people to pretend to be connected with a person who violates their expectancy by ignoring violations or filtering news feed. Meanwhile, people can also cut the connection completely with someone who is not important by deleting friendship status when a serious violation occurs. A confrontation is much more likely for close friends than for acquaintances, and compensation is much more likely for acquaintances, a finding which contrasts typical EVT predictions. Furthermore, EVT on the Internet environment is strongly related to online privacy issues.\n\nIn social media such as Facebook, people are connected online with friends and sometimes strangers. Norm violations on Facebook may include too many status updates, overly emotional status updates or Wall posts, heated interactions, name calling through Facebook's public features, and tags on posts or pictures that might reflect negatively on an individual. Research has also shown that the act of unfriending on Facebook is perceived as a highly negative expectancy violation, with the duration of the Facebook friendship and personal ties to the unfriending party dictating how negatively the act is perceived. Moreover, the importance of the violation was also found to dictate whether the unfriending person informed the other individual of their actions.\n\nIn a study conducted by Fife, Nelson, and Bayles of focus groups from a Southeastern liberal arts university, five themes were ascertained regarding Facebook use and expectancy violations:\nIn 2010, Stutzman and Kramer-Duffield examined college undergraduates' motivations to have friends-only profiles on Facebook. Having a friends-only profile is a practical method to enhance privacy management on Facebook. The two authors made distinctions between intended audience, to whom one hopes to disclose the Facebook profile, and expected audience, a group of people by whom one thinks the Facebook profile has been viewed. The study indicated that \"expectancy violations were identified as instances where an expected audience was not jointly identified as an intended audience\". Facebook networks were categorized into different levels: strong ties of family and intimate friends, weak ties comprising \"casual friends and campus acquaintances\", and outsiders such as \"faculty or administrators\". According to the study, expectancy violations by weak ties showed greater relevance to the establishment of a friends-only profile among college undergraduates, compared to other Facebook network ties.\n\nEmail has become one of the most widely used methods of communication within organizations and workplaces. When discussing expectancy violations\nwith electronic e-mail, just as with other modes of communication, a distinction\nmust be made between inadvertent violations of norms and purposeful violations,\nreferred to as 'flaming'. Flaming\nis defined as hostile and aggressive interactions via text-based CMC.\n\nOne form of expectancy violation in email is the length of time between the sending of the initial email and the receiver's reply. Communicator reward valence plays a large part in how expectancy violations are handled in email communications. In computer-mediated communication, people have expectations to others’ online behaviors based on individual identity. In online contexts, violations are not simply assessed as positive or negative. Some violations are ambiguous such as e-mail response latency. In 2017, Nicholls and Rice stated that “when deviation is ambiguous, the communicator’s reward value will mediate the perceptions of the deviation.”\n\nChronemic studies on email have shown that in organizations, responder status played a large part in how individuals reacted to various lapses in response to the previously sent email. Long pauses between responses for high-status responders produced positive expectancy violation valence and long pauses from low-status responders produced a negative expectancy violation valence. However, in the case of job interviews, long pauses between email for high-status candidates reflected negatively on their reviews. Expectations for email recipients to respond within a normative time limit illustrate the medium's capacity for expectancy violations to occur.\n\nMcPherson, Kearney, and Plax examined teacher anger in college classrooms through the lens of norm violations. Naturally, teachers will become frustrated and angry with students in classrooms from time to time. How teachers express themselves and convey those\nemotions will determine how students respond and interpret those emotional demonstrations.\nThe students judged the appropriateness of teachers' anger in classrooms in the modal expressions of distributive aggression, passive aggression, integrative assertion, and nonassertive denial. Students rated the aggressive expressions as\nhighly intense, destructive, and inappropriate (or non-normative), including such behaviors as sarcasm or putdowns (most\nfrequently cited), verbal abuse, rude and condescending behaviors toward students, and acts intended to demoralize students. The students described assertive displays as appropriate and less intense. Although anger is often considered to be a negative emotion, teacher anger is not necessarily a violation of classroom norms. Based on the study, intense and aggressive displays of teacher anger are considered socially inappropriate by students. These perceived norm violations result in negative evaluations of the teacher and the course. Because only integrative-assertive expressions of teacher anger were positively related to students' perceptions of appropriateness, the study concluded that teachers should avoid intense, aggressive anger displays and should rather assertively and directly discuss the problem with students.\n\nClothing is considered a form of nonverbal communication. Dress communicates status, hierarchy, credibility, and attractiveness. Specific social codes dictate what forms of dress are appropriate in various cross-cultural contexts. When individuals wear clothing that is deemed inappropriate for a given situation, or when an individual's clothing does not seem to match their perceived status or attractiveness, this can constitute an expectancy violation. Studies on clothing and teacher perceptions have shown that when teachers wear formal attire, students rate their credibility higher. However, for high-reward teachers, clothing formality did not raise perceptions of attractiveness. Students seem to retain information best when teachers are dressed moderately, and teacher value appears to derive from what grade students predict they will get from a teacher more so than clothing.\n\nGenerally, students have expectations to their instructors in college classroom. According to Sidelinger and Bolen, students might be dissatisfied about instructors who talk a lot during class. After they did the research about the compulsive communication and communication satisfaction, they concluded that if an instructor is evaluated as credible by the students, his credibility decreases students’ dissatisfaction despite of his talkativeness. Particularly, instructor’s goodwill such as politeness and care for students is the most effective characteristic to alleviate students’ negative feelings towards a talkative instructor.\n\nMost American colleges and universities employ course rating surveys as a method to gauge teacher effectiveness and the degree to which students are satisfied with the pedagogy of their professors. Expectancy violation and violation valence play a part in course ratings because a wide range of expectancies exist for students while taking a course. Common expectancies for students include stimulation and interest, instructor behavior, relevance of the course, and the student's expected and actual success in the course. A higher education study on EVT and course ratings analyzed 228 students in seven introductory sociology classes at a university of 25,000 students. Since the courses were required for most students, were open to all students, used the same textbook, and met for the same length of time during the semester, expectancy violations in the classroom could be reported more accurately. Some factors used to report the data included instructor personality, interestingness and informativeness of textbook materials, difficulty of lectures, lecturer speaking ability, and the ability to answer questions. At the end of the study, the only factor that affected course ratings was relevance. Expectancies had virtually no effect otherwise on course evaluations. This reason could be attributed to the fact that students who found a course highly relevant were already interested in the subject area and were more motivated to do well.\n\nEVT has been used to study the experiences of non-traditional college and university students who begin an undergraduate education over the age of 25. The study focused on the students' expectations of their professors and how they should behave in the classroom. Since nontraditional students often feel that they are different from their academic peers, and since the traditional university setting focuses on the 18-23-year-old demographic, studying nontraditional student classroom experiences can help higher education institutions instruct teachers on how to behave in the classroom. Traditional and non-traditional students have been shown to expect teachers to make use of examples, provide feedback, and adequately prepare them for exams. Both traditional and non-traditional students have been found to have their expectations for instructor clarity negatively violated. Surprisingly, non-traditional students differed from traditional students by responding negatively to affinity-seeking behaviors and believed that instructors should be less concerned with making class more fun and enjoyable.\n\nIn 2013, Frisby and Sidelinger conducted a research about student disclosures in college classroom, which discussed about what kinds of student disclosures would violate peers’ expectations and their perceptions about the disclosers. According to the study, those who make inappropriate disclosures violate others’ expectations most in a classroom environment. Inappropriate disclosures are described as high frequent, negative, offensive and irrelevant topics. Disclosers of inappropriate information are more likely to be described as incompetent students, and they are less likeable than students who disclose appropriate information that are related to course materials.\n\nA 2008 study of the top 500 US colleges by Kaplan found that 10% of admissions offices checked applicants' social networking site (SNS) profiles, and 38% of those saw information that reduced the applicants' prospects for admission. In 2011, a college student was cited for underage drinking after campus police found pictures on Facebook of\nthe student holding a beer.\nSwearing and cursing are some of the most readily observable instances of verbal expectancy violations. Examples of swearing expectancy violations include U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney telling Patrick Leahy, Senator of Vermont, to \"go fuck yourself\", actor Christian Bale's lashing out toward a bystander who walked in front of the camera while he was filming, and U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's remarks during a live broadcast of his speech congratulating U.S. President Barack Obama on passage of the health care reform bill, commenting that it was a \"big fucking deal\". Expletives also vary among different cultures, so valence of expectancy violations involving swearing may differ when used in different contexts.\n\nSwearing is common among many workplaces. Swearing has been identified functionally as one of several ways to express emotion in response to workplace stress, to convey verbal aggression, or to engage in deviant workplace behavior (Johnson, 2012). In formal work settings, people have much stronger feelings that their expectations are violated by swearing than in casual occasions. Expletives are more prevalent in unstructured conversations than in more structured, task-oriented ones (Johnson, 2012). The use of profanity has been shown to influence the perceptions of speakers. It may also have emotional impact on the user and the audience. Research has shown that profanity users appear less trustworthy, less sociable, and less educated. The more swearing messages one expresses that violate respondent's expectations in workplaces, the more negative evaluations the respondent will generate about the speaker's incompetency. These traits are likely to appear as fixed among profanity users. Moreover, the content of the swearing messages also poses great impact on the extent of expectancy violations in formal work settings. The verbal messages include words related to sex, excretion and profaneness. Research found that respondents experience highest level of surprise about the swearing with sexual expressions. Thus their expectations are more likely to be violated by sexual swearing than excretory and profane words. A more productive approach than focusing on whether a specific word is offensive may be to make sure that those engaging in workplace swearing are aware of how they and their messages might be perceived in multiple ways (Johnson, 2012).\n\nExpectancy violations are tightly related to the changes of people's evaluation on their relationships with media figures. In 2010, Cohen made comparisons between relationships with friends and media figures in order to find similarities and differences of people's reactions when their expectations are violated in these two relationships. Violations were generally divided in three categories: social violations such as making offensive comments, trust violations such as making up stories about their life experience, and moral violations such as cheating in a marital relationship or drunk driving.\n\nResearch indicated that in both friendships and relationships with media figures, social and trust violations are more offensive than moral violations. Specifically, people are more intolerable about moral violations from media figures than from their friends. According to the study, the reason for the intolerance is because relationships with media figures are relatively weak that people invest less on the relationships with media figures than on friendships.\nThe type of media figures is also an important factor to determine the changes of closeness with media figures. People have different expectations to various types of media figures. Research discussed that moral violations negatively influence relationships with athletes, damaging their positive and energetic appearance expected by the public. Social violations reduce closeness with TV hosts, whom people expect as amiable public figures.\n\nExpectancy violation theory has even been applied to encouraging healthy habits and changing bad ones. In a study by Karolien van den Akker, Myrr van den Broek, Remco C. Havermans, and Anita Jansen, expectancy violation theory was tested to see if it was successful in changing ingrained cravings for chocolate. Although researchers did not find that expectancy violation mediated responses to chocolate cravings, they believe more research is needed to determine whether this theory is profitable for this kind of application to human behavior.\n\nEVT assumes that humans have a certain degree of free will. This theory assumes that humans can assess and interpret the relationship and liking between themselves and their conversational partner, and then make a decision whether or not to violate the expectations of the other person. The theory holds that this decision depends on what outcome they would like to achieve. This assumption is based on the \"interaction position\". The interaction position is based on a person's initial stance toward an interaction as determined by a blend of personal Requirements, Expectations, and Desires (RED). These \"RED\" factors meld into our interaction position of what's needed, anticipated, and preferred.\n\nEVT assumes that there are norms for all communication activities and if these norms are violated, there will be specific, predictable outcomes. EVT does not fully account for the overwhelming prevalence of reciprocity that has been found in interpersonal interactions. Secondly, it is silent on whether communicator valence supersedes behavior valence or vice versa when the two are incongruent, such as when a disliked partner engages in a positive violation.\n\nThis theory seeks to be value-neutral as supporting studies have been conducted empirically and sought to objectively describe how humans react when their expectations are violated.\n\nExpectancy violations theory has undergone scrutiny for its attempt to provide a covering law for certain aspects of interpersonal communication. Some critics of EVT believe most interactions between individuals are extremely complex and there are many contingencies to consider within the theory. This makes the prediction of behavioral outcomes of a particular situation virtually impossible to consistently predict.\n\nAnother critique of the theory is the assumption that expectancy violations are mostly highly consequential acts, negative in nature, and cause uncertainty to increase between communicators. In actuality, research shows expectancy violations vary in frequency, seriousness, and valence. While it is true that many expectancy violations carry a negative valence, numerous are positive and actually reduce uncertainty because they provide additional information within the parameters of the particular relationship, context, and communicators.\n\nEmory Griffin, the author of \"A First Look at Communication Theory\", analyzed unpredictability in expectancy violations theory. His test consisted in analyzing his interaction with four students who made various requests from him. The students were given the pseudonyms Andre, Belinda, Charlie and Dawn. They start with the letters A, B, C and D to represent the increasing distance between them and Griffin when making their requests.\n\nAndre needed the author's endorsement for a graduate scholarship, and spoke to him from an intimate eyeball-to-eyeball distance. According to Burgoon's early model, Andre made a mistake when he crossed Griffin's \"threat threshold\"; the physical and psychological discomfort the lecturer might feel could have hurt his cause. However, later that day Griffin wrote the letter of recommendation.\n\nBelinda needed help with a term paper for a class with another professor, and asked for it from a 2-foot distance. Just as Burgoon predicted, the narrow gap between Belinda and Griffin determined him to focus his attention on their rocky relationship, and her request was declined.\n\nCharlie invited his lecturer to play water polo with other students, and he made the invitation from the right distance of 7 feet, just outside the range of interaction Griffin anticipated. However, his invitation was declined.\n\nDawn launched an invitation to Griffin to eat lunch together the next day, and she did this from across the room. According to the nonverbal expectancy violations model, launching an invitation from across the room would guarantee a poor response, but this time, the invitation was successful.\n\nGriffin's attempt to apply Burgoon's original model to conversational distance between him and his students didn't meet with much success. The theoretical scoreboard read:\n\nHowever, when Grifffin applied the revised EVT standards on his responses to \"the proxemic violations of Andre, Belinda, Charlie, and Dawn,\" the scorecard \"shows four hits and no misses.\"\n\nBecause EVT is sociopsychological in nature and focuses on social codes in both intrapersonal and interpersonal communication, it is closely related to communication theories such as cognitive dissonance and uncertainty reduction theory. Recently, this theory has undergone some reconstitution by Burgoon and her colleagues and has resulted in a newly proposed theory known as interaction adaptation theory, which is a more comprehensive explanation of adaptation in interpersonal interaction.\n\nAs mentioned above, EVT has strong roots in uncertainty reduction theory. The relationship between violation behavior and the level of uncertainty is under study. Research indicates that violations differ in their impact on uncertainty. To be more specific, incongruent negative violations heightened uncertainty, whereas congruent violations (both positive and negative) caused declines in uncertainty. The theory also borrows from social exchange theory in that people seek reward out of interaction with others.\n\nTwo other theories share similar outlooks to EVT – Discrepancy-Arousal Theory and Patterson's social facilitation model (SFM). Like EVT, DAT explains that a receiver becomes aroused when a communicative behavior does not match the receiver's expectations. In DAT, these differences are called discrepancies instead of expectancy violations. Cognitive dissonance and EVT both try to explain why and how people react to unexpected information and adjust themselves during communication process.\n\nThe social facilitation model has a similar outlook and labels these differences as unstable changes. A key difference between the theories lies in the receiver's arousal level. Both DAT and SFM maintain that the receiver experiences a physiological response whereas EVT focuses on the attention shift of the receiver. EVT posits that expectancy violations occur frequently and are not always as serious as perceived through the lenses of other theories.\n\nAnxiety/uncertainty management theory is the uncertainty and Anxiety people have towards each other, relating to EVT this anxiety and uncertainty can differ between cultures. Causing a violation for example violating someones personal distance or communicating ineffectively can cause uncertainty and anxiety.\n\nThe popularity of computer-mediated communication (CMC) as means of conducting task-oriented and socially oriented interactions is a part of the social information processing (SIP) theory. Coined by Joseph Walther, the theory explores CMC's ability to fulfill many of the same functions as the more traditional forms of interaction, especially face-to-face (FtF) interaction. SIP can be used in conjunction with EVT to examine interpersonal and hyperpersonal relationships established through CMC.\n\nThe concept of social norms marketing follows expectancy violation in that it is based upon the notion that messages containing facts that vary from perception of the norm will create a positive expectancy violation. Advertising, strategic communications, and public relations base social norms campaigns on this position.\n\nInteraction adaptation theory further explores expectancy violations. Developed by Burgoon to take a more comprehensive look at social interaction, IAT posits that people enter into interactions with requirements, expectations, and desires. These factors influence both the initial behavior as well as the response behavior. When faced with behavior that meets an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, the response behavior will be positive. When faced with behavior that does not meet an individual's needs, expectations, or desires, he or she can respond either positively or negatively depending on the degree of violation and positive or negative valence of the relationship.\n\nExpectancies exert significant influence on people's interaction patterns, on their impressions of one another, and on the outcomes of their interactions. People who can assume that they are well regarded by their audience are safer engaging in violations and more likely to profit from doing so than are those who are poorly regarded. When the violation act is one that is likely to be ambiguous in its meaning or to carry multiple interpretations that are not uniformly positive or negative, then the reward valence of the communicator can be especially significant in moderating interpretations, evaluations, and subsequent outcomes.\n\nEVT also applies to international experience in the workplace. “A foreign newcomer who has the necessary education, work experience, and international experience will be perceived as having the ability to make valuable contribution to the group’s task. Consequently, education, work experience and international experience will influence a foreign newcomer’s initial task-based group acceptance (Joardar, 2011). It can be argued that a person with significant international experience will be perceived as having had the opportunity to learn how to build valuable relationships in a cross-cultural setting. Hence, international experience will have effects on initial relationship-based group acceptance as well. Meaning, this will make for a more positive expectancy violation, in the workplace especially. \nEVT is also used as a framework to analyze the negative impact of mind reading expectations on romantic relationships. In 2015, Wright and Roloff explained the idea of mind reading expectations (MRE) that romantic partners should clearly know about each other's feelings even though they are not being informed. When relational partners have done something wrong without self-consciousness, people's expectations are violated. Particularly those who hold high value of MRE are more likely to become distressful once their relational partners are unaware of their violations to expectations. The study asserted that such kinds of violations related to MRE result in responses such as combative attitude and silent treatment, which is harmful to long-term romantic relationships.\n\n"}
{"id": "33687930", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33687930", "title": "Family feuds in the United States", "text": "Family feuds in the United States\n\nFeuds in the United States deals with the phenomena of historic blood feuding in America. These feuds have been numerous and some became quite vicious. Often, a conflict which may have started out as a rivalry between two individuals or families became further escalated into a clan-wide feud or a range war, involving dozens—or even hundreds—of participants. Below are listed some of the most notable blood feuds in United States history, most of which occurred in the Old West.\n\nAaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton were two noted founding fathers as famous for their feud-ending duel as their politics. The trouble began in 1791 when the Democrat-Republican Burr was elected senator for New York, replacing the Federalist, and Hamilton-backed, Philip Schuyler. This began the political feud between the two which culminated in the July 11, 1804 duel.\n\nHamilton had been actively fighting against Burr’s campaign for governor of New York; helping to ensure that a rival politician, Morgan Lewis, won. Burr took this personally. After several months marked by heated personal correspondence, published accusations, and verbal sparring between the two, he challenged Hamilton to a duel. As dueling had been outlawed in the state of New York, the two, along with their seconds, traveled to Weehawken, New Jersey for their final confrontation. Mortally wounded in the abdomen by Burr, Hamilton died the next day.\n\nA family feud that took place immediately following the American Civil War, in Bell County, Texas from 1865 to 1869; where the two families and their allies found themselves extending the ideological battle of that recent conflict.\n\nJohn Early, a supporter of the federal officials then occupying Texas, was an early member of the Texas Home Guard. He was having repeated run-ins with Drew Hasley, an older local citizen who had been a staunch Confederacy backer. When Hasley’s son, Samuel, returned from service in the war, he became active in the conflict with Early, escalating the feud. When the younger Hasley brought a local outlaw, Jim McRae, into the fight, Early sought federal troop intervention, which was granted. On July 30, 1869, McRae was ambushed and killed. Dr. Calvin Clark, an Early ally, was gunned down shortly afterward in Arkansas. The Hasley supporters soon disbanded and the feud faded.\n\nPerhaps the most infamous feud in the history of the U.S., the Hatfield–McCoy conflict is now an icon of American folklore. The Hatfields, of West Virginia, were led by William Anderson \"Devil Anse\" Hatfield. The McCoys, of Kentucky, were under the leadership of Randolph \"Ole Ran’l\" McCoy.\n\nThe feud began after the killing of Asa Harmon McCoy, an ex-Union soldier, who was gunned down on January 7, 1865, while hiding in a cave. McCoy died at the hands of a group of Hatfield allies, and Confederate irregulars (named the \"Logan Wildcats\"), who had tracked him to his hiding place. The conflict was renewed thirteen years later when two McCoy family members killed a witness (who was related to both families) and who had testified against them in a court case involving ownership of a stray pig.\n\nThe simmering feud escalated soon afterward, when Roseanna McCoy began a courtship with Johnson \"Johnse\" Hatfield, Devil Anse’s son. Roseanna left her family to live with the Hatfields in West Virginia. In 1881, when Johnse abandoned the pregnant Roseanna, marrying her cousin instead, the bitterness between the two families grew. In 1882, Ellison Hatfield, brother of Devil Anse Hatfield, was killed in an election-day dispute by three of Roseanna’s brothers, who themselves were killed by a Hatfield-led mob while in the custody of the law.\n\nBetween 1880 and 1891, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families, becoming headline news around the country.\n\nThe feud reached its peak during the so-called 1888 New Years Night Massacre. Several of the Hatfield gang surrounded the McCoy cabin and opened fire on the sleeping family. The cabin was set on fire in an effort to drive Randolph McCoy into the open. He escaped by making a break, but two of his children were murdered, and his wife was beaten and left for dead.\n\nIn 1888, Wall Hatfield and eight others were arrested and ordered to stand trial for the New Years Night murders. Seven received life imprisonment, while the eighth, Ellison \"Cottontop\" Mounts, was executed by hanging. Fighting between the families eased following the hanging of Mounts. Trials, however, continued for several years, with the trial of Johnse Hatfield the last, in 1901.\n\nThe Lee–Peacock feud took place in the four-corners area of the Texas counties of Fannin, Grayson, Collin, and Hunt. It became a local, four-year extension of the American Civil War - lasting from 1867 to 1871 - in which an estimated 50 men lost their lives.\n\nWhen the war broke out, a resident of the area, Bob Lee, immediately joined the Confederate Army, leaving his wife, three children, and his home in the care of his father Daniel. Near the end of the war, word reached Lee that a Union sympathizer, Lewis Peacock, had set up an organization in his home which was actively working for the protection of blacks and Union sympathizers. This was \"The Union League\", in Pilot Grove, Texas, less than seven miles from Lee’s home. By the time that Lee and other ex-Confederate soldiers of the area returned to their homes in northeast Texas, the region was already roiling in conflict, as most area residents resented the intrusion of the Reconstruction soldiers stationed throughout the state.\n\nOne night in late 1866, Peacock and several of his followers allegedly \"arrested\" Lee, but instead kidnapped him, robbed him, and forced him to sign a $2,000 promissory note to secure his release. The Lee clan subsequently refused to honor the note. Shortly thereafter, in February 1867, an assassination attempt on Lee took place was perpetrated by Peacock ally Jim Maddox. A few days later, as he lay convalescing in the next room, Lee’s doctor was murdered by Hugh Hudson, another Peacock sympathizer, and the feud immediately escalated.\n\nHudson, the doctor’s killer, was himself quickly killed, as were other combatants. Many were wounded, including Peacock. By the summer of 1868, the conflict had become so heated that Peacock requested help from the federal government, which promptly posted a $1,000 reward for Bob Lee's capture. The U.S. Cavalry, acting on a tip from an informant, shot Lee down on May 24, 1869; however, the fighting still continued. It wasn’t until Lewis Peacock was himself killed, on June 13, 1871, that the feud ended.\n\nThis notorious range war began as a county law enforcement issue between the Taylor family, headed by Pitkin Taylor, brother of Creed Taylor, a renowned Texas Ranger, and local lawman William E. Sutton, a former Confederate soldier, who had moved with his family to DeWitt County, Texas, originally intending to simply raise cattle. The feud, which lasted a decade and cost at least 35 lives, has been called the longest and bloodiest in Texas history. It eventually involved the Texas State Police, the Texas Rangers, and the outlaw John Wesley Hardin.\n\nSutton had become a deputy sheriff in Clinton, Texas, and on March 25, 1868, he shot and killed a Taylor kinsman, Charley Taylor, whom he was trying to arrest for horse theft. The following Christmas Eve, Sutton killed Buck Taylor and Dick Chisholm in a saloon in Clinton, after an argument regarding the sale of some horses. On August 23, 1869, the Sutton faction was suspected of the ambush and killing of Jack Hays Taylor.\n\nIn July 1870, Sutton was appointed to the State Police Force, serving under Captain Jack Helm (sometimes Helms). The police force was tasked with enforcing the \"Reconstruction\" policies of the federal government, but operated with somewhat of a free-hand, and more often than not returned with wanted suspects dead.\n\nOn August 26, 1870, the Suttons were allegedly sent to arrest Henry and his brother William Kelly, who were both related by marriage to Pitkin Taylor, on a trivial charge. However, rather than arresting the men, the Suttons shot the Kellys. Due to his handling of the affair, Helm was dismissed from the State Police Force, though cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nIn early 1872, on-the-run outlaw John Wesley Hardin joined his cousin, Mannen Clements, in neighboring Gonzales County, Texas. There, Clements and his brothers were active in the cattle rustling or herding business working for Taylor family friends.\n\nOn May 15, 1873, Sutton family allies Jim Cox and Jake Christman were killed by the Taylor faction during a gunfight at Tomlinson Creek. Hardin later admitted that there were reports that he had led the fight in which these two men were killed, but would neither confirm nor deny his involvement.\n\nTwo days later, in a May 17, 1873, gunfight, Hardin killed Dewitt County deputy sheriff, J.B. Morgan—serving under Helm, who was now sheriff of DeWitt County. Hardin played a part in the assassination later that same day of Sheriff Helm in Albuquerque, Texas. Hardin, Helm and Sam McCracken, Jr. were gathered together talking in front of a blacksmith shop. Helm was unarmed, having left his revolvers at Mrs. McCracken's boarding house, where he was then residing. James Taylor advanced on Helm from behind and attempted to discharge his revolver, but it misfired. As Helm turned, Taylor fired again, this time striking Helm in the chest. Helm rushed Taylor with the intent to grapple with him, but Hardin discharged a double barrel shotgun, shattering his arm. As Helm attempted to flee into the blacksmith shop, Hardin held townspeople at gunpoint while Taylor unloaded the remaining five bullets from his revolver into him. As Hardin and Taylor mounted their horses and prepared to ride away, they boasted that they had accomplished what they had come to do. The next night, Hardin and other Taylor supporters surrounded the ranch house of Sutton family ally, Joe Tumlinson. A shouted truce was arranged and both sides signed a peace treaty in Clinton, Texas. However, within a year, violence once again broke out between the two sides.\n\nThe feud reached its apex when Jim and his cousin Bill Taylor gunned down Billy Sutton and a friend, Gabriel Slaughter, as they waited on a steamboat platform, in Indianola, Texas on March 11, 1874. Tired of the feud, Billy Sutton had been planning to leave the area for good. In retaliation, the Sutton faction caught and lynched three of the Taylor group, on June 22, 1874. After this, the fighting continued, though with much less frequency. Jim Taylor was killed January 1, 1875. On November 17, 1875, Reuben H. Brown, the new leader of the Suttons and ex-marshal of Cuero, Texas, was shot down in the Exchange Saloon by Hardin, his last known action in the feud.\n\nIn October 1876, after another outbreak of violence, Texas Ranger, Captain Jesse Lee Hall, led a force into Cuero, Texas to break up the feud for good. By January 1877, he and his supporting troop had put an end to the conflict.\n\nThe Horrell and Higgins families had both settled in the Lampasas County, Texas area several years before the American Civil War. By all accounts, the two families got along well for over a decade. However, by the early 1870s, the five 'Horrell boys': Mart, Tom, Merritt, Ben and Sam had been involved in numerous lawless activities. In January 1873, Lampasas County Sheriff, Shadrick T. Denson, attempted to arrest two brothers, Wash and Mark Short, who were friends of the Horrell family. Intervention by the Horrell brothers resulted in a gunfight in which Sheriff Denson was shot and killed. A county judge appealed to Texas Governor, Edmund J. Davis, for help. The Texas State Police dispatched a number of lawmen to the area to maintain order.\n\nOn March 14, 1873, state officers Wesley Cherry, Jim Daniels, and Andrew Melville arrested Bill Bowen, a brother-in-law to the Horrell brothers, for carrying a firearm (which Governor Davis had recently outlawed in the area). The officers then entered Jerry Scott's Saloon with Bowen in tow. After a verbal exchange with the Horrell brothers, who had been inside the saloon, a gunfight ensued. Four of the officers were killed, including Capt. Williams. Williams had managed to shoot and badly wound Mart Horrell, and his brother, Tom Horrell, was also among the wounded. Following the gunfight, more state police were sent to the county. Mart Horrell and three friends were arrested and taken to the Georgetown, Texas jail. However, a large crowd of Horrell family friends broke into the jail and freed them.\n\nThe brothers fled to Lincoln County, New Mexico, where later that same year, Ben Horrell was himself killed after he murdered a local law enforcement officer. In early February 1874, the brothers returned to Lampasas, but were no longer welcome. Shortly after their return, local rancher, John \"Pink\" Higgins, accused the Horrell brothers of rustling some of his cattle. The brothers were arrested, but were quickly acquitted. Although things were tense between the two families, no actions were taken by either side at that time.\n\nThe feud quickly escalated, when, on January 22, 1877 (while in the Wiley and Toland's Gem Saloon in Lampasas), John Higgins shot and killed Merritt Horrell in a gunfight. The three remaining Horrell brothers vowed revenge. On March 26, 1877, Tom and Mart Horrell were shot and wounded in an ambush, but both survived. John Higgins and Bob Mitchell were arrested for the action, but later acquitted.\n\nOn June 7, 1877, John Higgins rode into Lampasas accompanied by: brother-in-law, Bob Mitchell; Mitchell's brother, Frank; a friend, Bill Wren; and another brother-in-law, Ben Terry. The Horrell brothers and several friends were already in town, gathered at the town square. It is unknown who fired first, but it is believed that someone within the Horrell faction opened fire on the Higgins group. When the gunfight ended, Bill Wren had been wounded, Frank Mitchell had been killed, and Horrell faction members, Buck Waltrup and Carson Graham, had been killed.\n\nAll three Horrell brothers were arrested, and Texas Ranger, Major John B. Jones, acted as a mediator between the remaining members of the two factions. Less than one year later, Mart and Tom Horrell were arrested in Meridian, Texas for armed robbery and murder. While confined to the local jail, vigilantes broke in and shot and killed them both. Sam was the only remaining Horrell brother. He moved his family to Oregon in 1882, thus marking an end to the feud.\n\nThe Lincoln County Feud occurred in the Harts Creek community of Lincoln and Logan counties, West Virginia, between 1878 and 1890. Initially a personal vendetta between prominent residents Paris Brumfield and Canaan Adkins, the feud culminated in a bitter war between local timber barons and businessmen, including Allen Brumfield, John W. Runyon, and Benjamin Adams. The feud resulted in at least four deaths, numerous injuries and scuffles between factions, nationwide press coverage, and the extermination/out-migration of several key participants. It has been memorialized in at least one ballad and play, as well as through music recorded by John Hartford. Feud descendant and author Brandon Ray Kirk has written a history of the feud titled \"Blood in West Virginia: Brumfield v. McCoy\", which draws primarily upon twenty years of research including oral histories with other feud descendants, newspaper accounts, and courthouse documents.\n\nThe Earp vendetta ride arose as a result of coordinated attacks (in December 1881 and again in March 1882) against the Earp brothers. These ambushes were in retaliation for their involvement in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, in Tombstone, Arizona.\n\nThe noted gun-battle had occurred on October 26, 1881, and was itself the climax of the Earp–Clanton family feud, simmering since the summer of 1880. Tensions between the Earps and both the Clantons and McLaurys increased through 1881, culminating in the historic gunfight. At the O.K. Corral, three deputized Earp brothers, Wyatt, Morgan and Virgil, along with Doc Holliday, had killed Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury and Tom McLaury. The Clanton and McLaury families were aligned with the \"Outlaw Cowboys\", a loosely knit outlaw group of families, friends and acquaintances then living in surrounding Cochise and Pima counties.\n\nThe Earp Vendetta ride was a manhunt for the \"Outlaw Cowboys\" that Wyatt Earp held responsible for the maiming of his brother Virgil (the police chief of Tombstone, Arizona as well as a Deputy U.S. Marshal) the previous December, and the recent assassination of his brother Morgan (also an assistant U.S. Marshal) the week before. When several suspects in the attacks were set free by the court − some owing to legal technicalities and others based on the strength of alibis provided by sympathetic confederates – Wyatt Earp decided he could not rely on civil justice, and took matters into his own hands.\n\nOn March 20, 1882, a newly deputized United States Marshal Wyatt Earp formed a federal posse that began to scour Cochise and Pima counties for the purpose of hunting down and killing the men he thought guilty of the attacks. Wyatt and Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, John \"Texas Jack\" Vermillion, Dan Tipton, Charlie Smith, Fred Dodge, Johnny Green, and Lou Cooley made up the federal posse.\n\nThe killing began with the March 22, 1882, shooting of Frank Stilwell as he and several Outlaw Cowboys – including Ike Clanton – lay in ambush at the Tucson rail station. The Earp group was escorting the still invalid Virgil Earp, and his wife, to safety so they could be removed from the now dangerous Arizona Territory.\n\nCowboy confederate and Wyatt Earp rival, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, then formed his own posse and deputized a number of the outlaws, including Johnny Ringo, Phineas Clanton, Johnny Barnes and about 18 more men to ride after the federal posse and the five men \"wanted\" for the shooting of Stilwell.\n\nCarrying federal arrest warrants for the assassins, the federal posse killed four men. The vendetta ride ended with the killing of \"Curly Bill\" Brocius and Johnny Ringo on April 15, 1882. The Earps and their associates then quickly headed for the New Mexico Territory, leaving Arizona Territory, and the feuding behind.\n\nA family feud taking place between 1896 and 1902, centered in the Creek Nation of the old Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). It began with the death of Thomas Brooks on August 24, 1896. Brooks was killed during a botched holdup which was to originally include some members of the McFarland family in its execution. The Brooks family blamed the McFarland family for the death, and there followed a series of confrontations between the two clans that culminated in the historic shootout at Spokogee (now Dustin), Oklahoma on September 22, 1902. During the gunfight, family patriarch, Willis Brooks, and his son, Clifton were killed, as well as McFarland family associate, George Riddle. John Brooks, brother of Clifton, lay seriously wounded. Survivors Jim and Joe McFarland, Alonzo Riddle (George's brother), and the wounded John Brooks, were arrested pending murder charges, though all were quickly released on bail.\n\nThe feud ended on October 10, 1902 when Jim McFarland was ambushed and killed near his home, possibly at the hands of Sam Baker, a Brooks ally.\n\nJohn Brooks left the area after recuperating from his wounds. Remaining Brooks brother, Henry, left the area soon after serving time for a subsequent arrest for horse theft. He died violently in a shootout with Alabama law enforcement in 1911. Sam Baker was killed October 7, 1911 by the son of an irate shopkeeper he had previously confronted. Willis Brooks' widow and family matriarch, \"Old Jenny\" Brooks, died on March 29, 1924, at the age of ninety-eight, and is said to have been proud that all of her sons had \"\"died like men, with their boots on.\"\"\n\nThe members of McFarland faction were acquitted of any wrongdoing after the fight and continued living in the Dustin area.\n\nThe Reese–Townsend conflict, also called the \"Colorado County Feud\", was a politically motivated feud which took place in the closing days of the Old West. The events of the conflict were centered in Columbus, Texas, but involved other parts of Colorado County before it was over. The feud ran from 1898 through 1907. The feud resulted from a local political race that placed incumbent Sheriff Sam Reese against a former deputy sheriff, Larkin Hope. Former U.S. senator, Mark Townsend, was a power-broker who had been the deciding factor for several past contests for sheriff. He had pulled his support away from Reese, supporting Hope instead. This led to tensions between those in support of Reese, and the Townsend faction. When Hope was assassinated in downtown Columbus before the election was held, suspicion immediately fell on the Reese allies. Townsend's hand-picked replacement candidate, Will Burford, won the election.\n\nOn March 16, 1899, Reese was killed in a gunfight (provoked by him) with Townsend allies, and Reese's family vowed revenge. From May 17, 1899 to May 17, 1907, five additional gunfights took place in the area, with the results that Dick Reese (Sam's brother), Arthur Burford, Hiram Clements and Jim Coleman lost their lives in the violence. Legendary Texas Ranger, Captain Bill McDonald, along with officer James Brooks and others, were dispatched to the area to restore order, and ended the fighting.\n\n\n\n"}

The campaign was created by Joe Lawson and Noel Ritter while working at The Martin Agency. According to an episode of the public radio show \"99% Invisible\", \"It's so easy a caveman could do it\" was first coined by Ritter. The inspiration for the campaign came from \"Pastoralia\", a short story by George Saunders – the story revolves around two employees, a man and a woman, who work as \"cave-people\" for a failing theme park. In 2004, GEICO began an advertising campaign featuring Neanderthal-like cavemen in a modern setting. The premise of the commercials is that GEICO advertises that using their website is \"so easy, a caveman could do it\"; and that this slogan offends several cavemen, who not only still exist in modern society but live as intelligent, urbane bachelors. The first three GEICO commercials to feature cavemen were \"Apartment\", \"Apology\", and \"Boom Mic\".\n\nJeff Daniel Phillips and Ben Weber played the two earliest cavemen and continuously reprise their roles. Actor John Lehr appears most frequently as the caveman, while Ben Wilson has also portrayed one of the characters. The makeup effects for the caveman include facial prosthetics, dental veneers, lace hairpieces, and body hair, and were designed and created by Tony Gardner and his special effects company Alterian, Inc. In an online interview with \"Esquire\", Joe Lawson said that one aspect of the ads is a critique of modern political correctness. The cavemen have been honored by the Madison Avenue Advertising Walk of Fame.\n\n\nAlso, at the time of the launch of the Caveman's Crib website, a short advertisement featuring all cavemen at the \"hip party\" featured on the website was added after every Caveman commercial that was currently airing.\n\nRecently, one of the Cavemen was spotted filming a new commercial (or series of commercials) in Homer, Alaska on the Time Bandit boat (from The Deadliest Catch TV series). The Mayor of the city presented the caveman with a key to the city.\n\nOn March 2, 2007, \"Variety\" reported that a sitcom based on the cavemen characters, simply titled \"Cavemen\", was being developed for ABC. The magazine reported, \"'Cavemen' will revolve around three pre-historic men who must battle prejudice as they attempt to live as normal thirtysomethings in modern Atlanta.\" ABC announced this series for their fall schedule in May 2007. Originally it featured none of the Cavemen from the commercials, but Jeff Daniel Phillips later agreed to join the cast. It premiered on October 2, 2007. In the face of sagging ratings, it was quietly cancelled, automatically being the shortest lived ABC sitcom of the season. In February 2008, a new series of Caveman commercials featured two of the characters spoofing the premise of the show.\n\n\n"}

His name at birth was Yuri Nikolaevich Rerikh. George's work encompassed many areas of Tibetan studies, but in particular he is known for his contributions to Tibetan dialectology, his monumental translation of the \"Blue Annals\", and his 11-volume Tibetan-Russian-English dictionary (published posthumously).\n\nGeorge was the son of the painter and explorer Nicholas Roerich and Helena Roerich.\n\nMuch of Roerich's early life was spent in Saint Petersburg. His brother, Svetoslav Roerich, was born in 1904. Both sons' interests were nurtured by their mother, who wrote of her oldest son's childhood: \"The elder one showed love for history and tin soldiers. He had thousands of them. His passion for the art of war has survived until now. Strategy is his pet subject. By the way, this talent is inborn, and he is very proud of his ancestor — field marshal of the Russian Empire Mikhail Kutuzov, the hero of Patriotic War of 1812.\" \n\nBy the time Roerich was 15, he had already begun studying Egyptology with Boris Turayev and Mongolian language and history with Andrei Dmitryevich Rudnyev. He was a student with broad interests and many talents. After finishing his studies at Karl May School, he entered the Indian and Iranian department of Oriental Languages at London University in 1918. Under Indologist Professor Edward Denison Ross he studied Sanskrit and Pali. He was recognized for his language abilities and was introduced as the best Sanskrit student to the Secretary of State for Indian Affairs who visited the university.\n\nUpon completion of his study at London University in 1920, he moved to America with his parents. He studied in the Indian Philology Department of Harvard University and also studied during his time there. At the age of 18, Roerich was already firmly rooted in his passion for Oriental studies. He mastered Sanskrit during his time at Harvard under the direction of Professor Charles Rockwell Lanman, whose comparative grammar lessons made a lifelong impact on George's future studies. Roerich also attended lectures by Professor Michael Rostovtzeff on Middle Asia influences in the art of southern Russia. During his years at Harvard, he wrote his first essay on Buddhism and studied classical Chinese. He received both a bachelor's and master's degree from Harvard University, then continued his education in Paris, France.\n\nHe spent the years 1922-1923 at Paris University in Sorbonne, working in the Department of Middle Asian, Indian and Mongol-Tibetan Studies and studying in the Military Department as well as the Department of Law and Economy. During his time here, he cooperated with such famous orientalists as Paul Pelliot and Sylvain Lévi. He learned Mongolian and Tibetan while also continuing his study of Chinese and Persian languages. He graduated with his M.A. in Indian Philology in 1923.\n\nRoerich began his independent research at the age of 21. In November 1923 he left for Bombay with his family. After years of study and preparation, his dream of going to India came true. By December 1923, he had arrived at the base of the Himalayas as a member of a scientific expedition to Sikkim. The purpose of this expedition was to visit ancient monuments and Buddhist monasteries, as well as to record local legends, beliefs and artistic traditions. In Darjeeling, George polished his colloquial Tibetan with scholar Lama L.M. Dorje, who also guided him in the study of Tibetan Art. Roerich found strong similarities between ancient Russian icon painting and the art of tankha painting in both technique and in the treatment of the subject. He wrote: \"Indeed, it seems that the Russian icon art and the Tibetan pictorial art derive their methods of work from a common source... Thus we often see on Tibetan paintings the principal figures enthroned on an island (this being usually the case when Buddha or Bodhisattva is represented). Similar images are frequently found on Russian icons...\" In 1925, Roerich published his first book entitled 'Tibetan Paintings' in which he attempted to define Tibetan art, its history, and the three existing schools of art in Tibet. David Jackson in his 'A history of Tibetan painting' acknowledged that in the Western scholarship, \"the earliest account of Tibetan paintings styles... was that of George Roerich\".\n\nThe Roerich family embarked on an ambitious journey throughout Central Asia in 1925. This journey began in India and lasted four years. It was a crucial time in George Roerich's career as a scientist and he began his study of ancient pre-Buddhist doctrine of Bon and the translation of its manuscript. Despite the difficulties of travel and political instability, Roerich managed to make several important discoveries during this expedition, including previously unknown materials about the Tibetan Epic of King Gesar. Another important discovery was that the animal style that was used by nomads who had migrated from Central Asia to South Russia in the 7th and 8th centuries B.C.E. could also be found amongst Northern Tibetan nomads. Roerich believed that, \"All art objects made in animal style found and described by the expedition clearly proved the existence of ancient Central Asian art amongst nomads of Tibet.\"\n\nHis role as translator was invaluable to the group as they traveled. Roerich could speak Mongolian and Tibetan fluently, in addition to many other Central Asian languages. Despite his young age, he was given the task of guarding the group's safety. Here, his knowledge of military tactics from his university study proved useful and his tactical skills and courage saved their caravan on more than one occasion. His study of the geography, archeology, ethnology, and linguistics during the expedition formed the basis of his work \"Trails to Inmost Asia\", which was published in 1930. This publication put the young orientalist on par with the famous researchers of Central Asia, such as Nikolay Przhevalsky, Grigory Potanin, Pyotr Kozlov, and Sven Hedin.\n\nOf this lengthy and challenging journey, Roerich later said, \"The expedition headed by Professor Nicholas Roerich, organized by the Roerich Museum in New York and International Centre of Art “Corona Mundi” had as its main task creation of the unique pictorial panorama of the lands and nations of Inmost Asia.\nThe second task, was research of the possibilities of the new archaeological excavations, and thus, preparation of the ways for the future expeditions in this region. The third task was research of the languages and dialects of Central Asia, and gathering a big collection of objects, that depict spiritual culture of these nations. Central Asia has been a cradle and a meeting place of many Asian civilizations, and inaccessible mountain valleys till our days preserved many invaluable linguistic and ethnographic materials, which can help to reconstruct the past of Asia.\"\n\nThe plethora of materials collected during the Central Asia Expedition became the foundation for the establishment of the Himalayan Research Institute named 'Urusvati' in Darjeeling in 1928. A few months later the institute moved to Naggar in Kulu Valley. The center engaged in scientific exchange with 285 institutes, universities, museums, and libraries around the world. Roerich collaborated with Tibetan scholars and published the Tibetan English Dictionary in 1934. One of his main focuses for the center was to bring people to the institute who practiced and lived the cultures being examined by the center. He was the director of the institute for 10 years.\n\nIn 1934 – 1935, Roerich undertook an expedition with his father to Manchuria and Inner Mongolia which was organized by the US Department of Agriculture for the purpose of collecting seeds of drought resistant plants that would help prevent erosion of soils and the spreading of pests. In addition to gaining purely scientific knowledge, this expedition also had a social and cultural aim: to create wider agricultural cooperation and public collaboration. Professor Nicholas Roerich led the expedition while George Roerich was the assistant and responsible for the medicinal research. They gathered a collection of drought resistant plants, herbs, and soil, as well as a valuable list of traditional medicinal treatments. Roerich made maps and conducted a photo survey of the region in which the expedition took place. In 1935, the research from the expedition was transferred back to India and the Roerichs returned to Kulu Valley in October 1935.\n\nAfter the Manchuria expedition, Roerich spent many years living in India. His father, Nicholas Roerich, died in 1947. Due to political unrest in the area Roerich moved with his mother, Helena Roerich, from their home in Nagger to Kalimpong where he lived until 1956. Helena Roerich died in 1955 and in 1957 Roerich returned to Russia. Before his return to his homeland, Roerich participated in several important projects.\n\nHe collaborated with Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark and R. Sanskrtyayana to translate the Buddhist text \"Pramanavaartikam\" from Tibetan into Sanskrit. Working with Tse-Trung Lopsang Phuntshok he wrote \"Textbook of Colloquial Tibetan\". Together with Gendün Chöphel, he translated the lengthy pioneering work on Tibetan history, \"Blue Annals\", which was published in two volumes by the Asiatic Society in 1949 and 1954.\nAfter spending almost 30 years in India Roerich returned in 1957 to Soviet Russia, where he made efforts to revive the Russian School of Oriental Studies. As the Head of the Indology Department in the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, he resumed editing of \"Bibliotheca Buddhica\". This was a series devoted to the publication of Buddhist texts and monographs on the subject, started in 1897 by Prof. S.F. Oldenburg. In this same series A.I. Vostrikov's \"Tibetan Historical Literature\" and \"Dhammapada\" were also translated from Pali.\n\nHis return to Russia and acquisition of Soviet citizenship was courageous as the USSR's opinion of his family was rather distorted. Because of his effort, bans were lifted on everything associated with the Roerich family name and the legacy of research left by the family was preserved. The first of his father's exhibitions was organized in Moscow in 1958, then spread to Leningrad, Riga, Kiev, Tbilisi, and other cities. He was able to dispel myths about the family's philosophy of Agni Yoga and start a cultural movement using this philosophy to spread Living Ethics in the USSR.\n\nRoerich died on May 21, 1960, at the age of 58 and his ashes were placed in Moscow, at the Novodevichy Cemetery. Svetoslav Roerich is the author of the memorial to this outstanding Russian scientist.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}

In an attempt to corner the local market on gas stations, Dhinsa defrauded customers, evaded taxes, committed at least two murders, and is believed to have ordered eight others. He is serving a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release in a federal prison.\n\nDhinsa was born a Sikh in Punjab and expatriated to the Bronx in 1982. He worked as a Petroleum engineer until he was able procure a filling station of his own. As business improved, Dhinsa's holding company, Citygas Gasoline Corp \"City Gas\" opened more stations in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. At its height, City Gas had 51 locations and 300 employees, with annual revenues of $100 million.\n\nWhen Dhinsa leased his first gas station in 1984, neighborhood residents were illegally and forcibly using the lot to park their cars. According to a witness, Dhinsa smashed every windshield with a baseball bat. The cars were moved, and the gas station became profitable.\n\nAs he expanded his business, Dhinsa modified gas pumps, evaded taxes on gasoline bought in bulk, and kept his employees silent with death threats. He was arrested in 1990 on suspicion of kidnapping, robbery, and assault, but served only 90 days by pleading guilty to a weapons charge. In 1993, he was convicted of weapons charges again and served a year in prison.\n\nIn July 1995, Dhinsa ordered associates to kidnap an employee he suspected of stealing. When the victim's brother came looking for him in early 1997, Dhinsa ordered his murder. This killing was reported to police by several residents of the neighborhood. Police discovered that Dhinsa's brother Gurdip, who had fled to India to avoid prosecution for a 1991 murder, was back in the U.S. and was working at City Gas. On May 16, 1997, police surrounded the City Gas headquarters and arrested three employees, including Gurdip. When Gurmeet Dhinsa arrived at the scene, he was held for questioning and released. Although Dhinsa was released, a task force was formed to look into his operation, including the investigation of several disappearances and unsolved homicides. The kidnapped employee was never found.\n\nOn July 1, 1997, police were called by a man who claimed Dhinsa had threatened him and his family. Later that day, investigators stopped Dhinsa and searched the car he was driving. When Dhinsa opened the trunk, the police discovered circuit boards for gas pumps.\n\nPolice arrested Dhinsa on July 7. At the same time, Dhinsa's car was seized and inventoried. Evidence of gas pump tampering, including Department of Consumer Affairs metal seals and inspection stickers, was found during the search.\n\nOn August 22, 1997, Dhinsa was indicted by a grand jury on 29 counts including racketeering, murder, conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, and witness intimidation.\n\nDhinsa was represented by high-profile defense attorney Gerald Shargel, but was found guilty of murder and racketeering after an eight-week trial. Although the prosecution sought the death penalty, the jury turned down the request and Dhinsa was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. In addition, Dhinsa was forced to pay $1.75 million in restitution and fines—$625,000 to the family of each victim as well as a separate $500,000 fine to the city—and his businesses were auctioned by the government to cover civil fines.\n\nHe's in the FCI Schuylkill Now.\n\nThe story of the police investigation and prosecution of Dhinsa is the subject of an episode of The FBI Files entitled \"Deadly Business\" (Season 3, Episode 9).\n"}

{"id": "22404187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22404187", "title": "Information structure", "text": "Information structure\n\nIn linguistics, information structure, also called information packaging, describes the way in which information is formally packaged within a sentence. This generally includes only those aspects of information that “respond to the temporary state of the addressee’s mind”, and excludes other aspects of linguistic information such as references to background (encyclopedic/common) knowledge, choice of style, politeness, and so forth. For example, the difference between an active clause (e.g., \"the police want him\") and a corresponding passive (e.g., \"he is wanted by police\") is a syntactic difference, but one motivated by information structuring considerations. Other structures motivated by information structure include preposing (e.g., \"that one I don't like\") and inversion (e.g., \"\"the end\", said the man\").\n\nThe basic notions of information structure are focus, givenness, and topic, as well as their complementary notions of background, newness, and comment respectively. Focus “indicates the presence of alternatives that are relevant for the interpretation of linguistic expressions”, givenness indicates that “the denotation of an expression is present” in the immediate context of the utterance, and topic is “the entity that a speaker identifies, about which then information, the comment, is given”. Additional notions in information structure may include contrast and exhaustivity, but there is no general agreement in the linguistic literature about extensions of the basic three notions. There are many different approaches, such as generative or functional architectures, to information structure.\n\nInformation structure can be realized through a wide variety of linguistic mechanisms. In the spoken form of English Language, one of the primary methods of indicating information structure is through intonation, whereby pitch is modified from some default pattern. Other languages use syntactic mechanisms like dislocation, anaphora, and gapping; morphological mechanisms like specialized focus or topic-marking affixes; and specialized discourse particles. English in fact uses more than intonation for expressing information structure, so that clefts are used for exhaustive focus, and grammatical particles like \"only\" also induce contrastive focus readings.\n\nCross-linguistically, there are clear tendencies that relate notions of information structure to particular linguistic phenomena. For instance, focus tends to be prosodically prominent, and there do not seem to be any languages that express focus by deaccenting or destressing.\n\nThe following German sentences exhibit three different kinds of syntactic ‘fronting’ that correlate with topic.\n\nb. _Diesen Mann_, den habe ich noch nie gesehen.\n\nIt is often assumed that answers to questions are focused elements. Question and answer pairs are often used as diagnostics for focus, as in the following English examples.\n\n\"Focus\" is a grammatical category or attribute that determines indicating that part of an utterance contributes new, non-derivable, or contrastive information. Some theories (in line with work by Mats Rooth) link focus to the presence of \"alternatives\" (see Focus: Alternative Semantics). An alternatives theory of focus would account for the stress pattern in the example from the previous section (When did Jane sell the book? She sold the book YESTERDAY), saying that YESTERDAY receives focus because it could be substituted with alternative time periods (TODAY or LAST WEEK) and still serve to answer the question the first speaker asked.\n\n\"Background\" is a more difficult concept to define; it's not simply the complement of focus. Daniel P. Hole gives the following framework: \"‘Focus’ is a relational notion, and the entity a focus relates to is called its background, or presupposition.\"\n\nThe \"topic\" (or theme) of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the \"comment\" (or rheme, or sometimes focus) is what is being said about the topic. That the information structure of a clause is divided in this way is generally agreed on, but the boundary between topic/theme depends on grammatical theory. Topic is grammaticized in languages like Japanese and Korean, which have a designated topic-marker morpheme affixed to the topic.\n\nSome diagnostics have been proposed for languages that lack grammatical topic-markers, like English; they attempt to distinguish between different kinds of topics (such as \"aboutness\" topics and \"contrastive\" topics). The diagnostics consist of judging how felicitous it is to follow a discourse with either questions (\"What about x?\") or sentences beginning with certain phrases (\"About x, ... Speaking of x,\" ... \"As for x\", ...) to determine how \"topical\" \"x\" is in that context.\n\nIntuitively, \"givenness\" classifies words and information in a discourse that are already known (or given) by virtue of being common knowledge, or by having been discussed previously in the same discourse (\"anaphorically recoverable\"). Certain theories (such as Roger Schwarzschild's GIVENness Constraint) require all non-focus-marked constituents to be given.\n\nWords/information that are not given, or are \"textually and situationally non-derivable\" are by definition \"new\".\n"}

He received his PhD in Political Science from Columbia in 1998.\n\nMassad's first book, \"Colonial Effects: The Making of National Identity in Jordan\", was published in 2001 by Columbia University Press. The book is based on Massad's PhD dissertation, which won the Middle East Studies Association Malcolm Kerr Dissertation Award in 1998.\n\nOver the course of a detailed history of the Jordanian state, from its inception in 1921 to 2000, he argues that state institutions are central to the fashioning of national identity. Massad focuses on institutions of law, the military, and education as key components of nationalism, and elaborates on the production not only of national identity but also of national culture including food, clothes, sports, accents, songs, and television serials.\n\n\"Colonial Effects\" was critically praised both by several senior academics in Middle East Studies, including Edward Said who described the book as \"a work of genuine brilliance,\" and by scholars of nationalism such as Partha Chatterjee, Amr Sabet, and Stephen Howe, the last of whom called the book \"among the most sophisticated and impressive products\" of recent studies in the field. The book was extensively reviewed in academic journals and, according to Betty Anderson, one of the book's reviewers, it has become staple reading on syllabi of nationalism and Middle East politics university courses across the United States and Europe.\n\n\"The Persistence of the Palestinian Question: Essays on Zionism and the Palestinians\", Massad's second book, was published in 2006 by Routledge.\n\n\"The Persistence of the Palestinian Question\" analyzes Zionism and Palestinian nationalism from a variety of angles, including race, gender, culture, ethnicity, colonialism, antisemitism, and nationalist ideology. Massad's analysis of the discourse on terrorism in the introduction deals with the dynamics of power relations between Zionism and the Palestinians and traces the history of Zionist and Israeli violence which the British called \"terrorism\" in Palestine before 1948 and after, while his title chapter on the persistence of the Palestinian question argues that the Palestinian and the Jewish questions are one and the same and that \"both questions can only be resolved by the negation of anti-Semitism, which still plagues much of Europe and America and which mobilizes Zionism's own hatred of Jewish Jews and of the Palestinians.\"\n\nThe book has received praise from scholars Ilan Pappé and Ella Shohat as well as from Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi. Shohat praised the book as a \"timely and engaging volume\" that \"makes an invaluable contribution to the ongoing debate over Zionism and Palestine.\" Pappé saw the book as a \"courageous intellectual exercise\" and as \"a thought provoking book that forces us to reverse our conventional images and perceptions about Palestine's history and future.\"\n\nOther scholars situated the book's contribution in relation to European history and to the work of Edward Said. University of Pennsylvania political science professor Anne Norton wrote:\n\nMassad's brilliant and scholarly work is profoundly illuminating not only for the history of Palestine and the discourses surrounding it, but for the history of Europe and the United States and, finally, as an account that raises compelling theoretical questions.\n\nIn his review in \"Nations and Nationalism\", Israeli scholar Ephraim Nimni wrote that \n\nlike his intellectual mentor, Massad reminds us of a long and honourable tradition of Jewish Intellectuals who could only envisage the solution to the Jewish Question through universal emancipation. It seems that Massad, and the late Edward Said, are existential Diaspora Jews of the old kind ... The book is also fastidiously referenced, showing the erudition of the author and his command of the voluminous Israeli and Palestinian literature as well as the classics of Jewish history.\n\nMassad's third book, \"Desiring Arabs\", was published in 2007 by the University of Chicago Press. \"Desiring Arabs\" won Columbia University's 2008 Lionel Trilling Book Award, awarded by a jury of students on the grounds that it \"offers a probing study of representations of Arab sexuality\" and is \"an important and eloquent work of scholarship that the committee feels will have a lasting impact on the field.\"\n\n\"Desiring Arabs\" is an intellectual history of the Arab world and its Western representations in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The book makes contributions to a number of academic and theoretical fields. It extends Said's study of Orientalism by analyzing the latter's impact on Arab intellectual production; it links Orientalism to definitions and representations of sex and desire and in doing so provides a colonial archive to the sexual question that has hitherto been missing; it approaches the literary as the limits of imagining the future; and puts forth the question of translation as a central problem in Euro-American studies of the other.\n\nMassad argues that \"Western male white-dominated\" gay activists, under the umbrella of what he terms the \"Gay International,\" have engaged in a \"missionary\" effort to impose the binary categories of heterosexual/homosexual into cultures where no such subjectivities exist, and that these activists in fact ultimately replicate in these cultures the very structures they challenge in their own home countries. Massad writes that \n\nThe categories gay and lesbian are not universal at all and can only be universalized by the epistemic, ethical, and political violence unleashed on the rest of the world by the very international human rights advocates whose aim is to defend the very people their intervention is creating.\n\n\"Desiring Arabs\" has received critical praise from academics for its contributions both to the analysis of Arab culture and to the theory of sexuality.\n\nTalal Asad, professor of Anthropology at CUNY, described it as a \"remarkable book, at once a fascinating history of ideas and a brilliantly analyzed case study of cultural imperialism. ... [It] is quite stunning.\" Anton Shammas, professor of Arabic Literature at the University of Michigan, praised the book as an \"elaborate, relentless, and unabashed\" critique of Arab intellectual production on the question of sex and desire, \"the most interesting and equally illuminating commentaries on modern Arab culture to be published in the past decade.\" Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Avalon Foundation Professor of the Humanities, Columbia University blurbed the book in the following terms. \n\nThis compendious study of the discursive production of an Arab sexuality incorporates new readings of the modernity/tradition debates that go well beyond a specifically Arab context, and moves all the way from historical research into the history of literature and literary criticism. Even as it supplements Edward Said's work by its consideration of Arab Orientalism, Desiring Arabs boldly looks forward to an unscripted future.\n\nFerial Ghazoul reviewed the book in the \"Journal of Arabic Literature\", stating that \"Desiring Arabs\" \n\nis a brilliant text with a breadth of knowledge and sophisticated analytical techniques ... Massad's interdisciplinary approach, dense prose, impeccable research, and above all the thought-provoking issues he raises make his book a scholarly landmark ... As a student of the late Edward W. Said and as Desiring Arabs was dedicated to Said ... , Massad has certainly learned the lessons of Said, his critical innovation, his scholarly meticulousness, and his virtuoso style.\n\nFeminist scholar Joan Scott, a professor of history at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, describes the book as \"an inspired and erudite intellectual history, complex, nuanced, critical, and deeply engaged.\" Scott comments that Massad refuses both an essentialized opposition between Arab and Western civilization and an all-embracing universalism offered in the name of human rights. Instead, she writes, Massad insists that representations of Arab sexuality must be understood historically, as the outcome of the encounter between Arab and Orientalist writers. In her review of the book in the \"Arab Studies Journal\", feminist scholar Marnia Lazreg, a professor of sociology at CUNY, wrote, \"This truly monumental book is a corrective to Michel Foucault's History of Sexuality that inexplicably omitted the role played by the cultural effects of colonial systems on conceptions and constructions of sexuality ... [Desiring Arabs] is an epoch-making book\". Khaled El-Rouayheb of Harvard University called the book, \"A pioneering work on a very timely yet frustratingly neglected topic. ... I know of no other study that can even begin to compare with the detail and scope of [this] work.\"\n\nSamia Mehrez, a professor of Arabic Literature at the American University in Cairo writes in the \"Journal of Gender Studies\", \n\nDesiring Arabs by Joseph Massad is an impressive project that ventures into uncharted territory and can be read as a complement to both Edward Said's Orientalism and Michel Foucault's work on sexuality. Like all of Massad's work, Desiring Arabs investigates the discursive and institutional continuum through which culture is 'invented' under both colonial rule through colonial practices that sought to reify racial and religious differences as well as through the cultural politics of the post-colonial nation state and its efforts to consolidate the nation, national identity, and national belonging.\n\nWhile there has been a clear consensus on the book's significant scholarly contributions, some of the book's theses have also been criticized by Rayyan Al-Shawaf, a freelance writer and reviewer living in Beirut, who concedes that Massad makes a few good points, but observes that \n\nMassad's relativism – stemming from his accurate observation that 'homosexuality' is alien to Arab same-gender sexual traditions – is so extreme that he refuses to support a call for universal freedom of sexual identity.\n\nAl-Shawaf argues that, \n\nIn postulating the inevitability of (heterosexual) Arab violence wherever there is gay and lesbian assertiveness, Massad pre-emptively exonerates the perpetrators – whether individuals or the state – of any wrongdoing. However regrettable their behaviour, those Arabs who react violently to the gay rights campaign are not perceived by Massad as responsible for their actions, but as caught up in a broader struggle against 'imperialism', to which the gay rights movement is wedded.\n\n\"Islam in Liberalism\" is Joseph Massad's fourth book, published by University of Chicago Press in 2015. A review in the Los Angeles Review of Books states that the thesis of the book is that \"American and European missionaries of liberalism are trying to proselytize Muslims — and the entire world writ large — to the only sane system of values that exists on the planet: those of Western liberalism\". The book deals with the \"instrumentalization of Islam in the West\" and responds to critiques of his earlier book \"Desiring Arabs\".\n\nFollowing arguments made by Edward Said in his 1978 book Orientalism, Massad asserts that 19th Century European antisemitic characterizations of Jews have transformed in the present era to target Arabs, while maintaining the same racialist characterizations, and thus, racism towards Arabs and Muslims today is a form of \"Euro-American Christian anti-Semitism and ... Israeli Jewish anti-Semitism.\" Massad bases this belief on an understanding of antisemitism as a specific historical phenomenon originating in Europe, rather than simply as hatred of Jews; he writes: \"... the claims made by many nowadays that any manifestation of hatred against Jews in any geographic location on Earth and in any historical period is 'anti-Semitism' smack of a gross misunderstanding of the European history of anti-Semitism.\"\n\nMassad has characterized Israel as \"a racist Jewish state.\" In Massad's view, Zionism is not only racist but antisemitic, and antisemitic not only towards Arab Palestinians, but also towards Jews. Massad writes that after Europeans invented the racialist conception of the \"Semite,\" the Zionist movement \"adopted wholesale anti-Semitic ideologies\", and describes Zionism as an \"anti-Semitic project of destroying Jewish cultures and languages in the diaspora\", which has ultimately led to \"the transformation of the Jew into the anti-Semite, and the Palestinian into the Jew.\" Massad further accuses Zionists of unjustly \"appropriating the fruit of the land that Palestinian peasants produced,\" and specifies the renaming of \"Palestinian rural salad (now known in New York delis as Israeli salad)\" as an example of Israeli \"racism.\"\n\nMassad has spoken of genetic links being established between 19th-century European Jews and the ancient Israelite kingdom and the creation of a \"semitic\" identity for Jews at that time as actually a European, racist construction designed to portray European Jews as foreigners. Massad considers claims to Israel made by the Zionists movement based on that connection to be \"problematic.\" In a debate with Israeli historian Benny Morris, Massad said:\n\nThe claim made by the Zionists, and by Professor Morris, that late nineteenth-century European Jews are direct descendants of the ancient Palestinian Hebrews is what is preposterous here. This kind of anti-Semitic claim that European Jews were not European that was propagated by the racist and biological discourses on the nineteenth century, that they somehow descend from first-century Hebrews, despite the fact that they look like other Europeans, that they speak European languages, is what is absurd.\n\nMassad argues that US imperialism is ultimately behind Israeli actions. He has problematized the mainstream criticisms of the Israel Lobby by explaining the underlying imperialist affinities that tie Israel and the US together: \"the lobby is powerful in the United States because its major claims are about advancing US interests and its support for Israel is contextualised in its support for the overall US strategy in the Middle East.\" Massad is especially critical of \"rabidly pro-Israeli American President Obama.\"\n\nMassad views US culture as deeply infected with racism and misogyny, tying the Abner Louima case to torture in Abu Ghraib, and arguing that in Iraq, \"American male sexual prowess, usually reserved for American women, [was] put to military use in imperial conquests\", with \"Iraqis ... posited.. as women and feminised men to be penetrated by the missiles and bombs ejected from American warplanes.\" Massad concludes that \"the content of the word 'freedom' that American politicians and propagandists want to impose on the rest of the world is nothing more and nothing less than America's violent domination, racism, torture, sexual humiliation, and the rest of it.\"\n\nMassad has also criticized Arab intellectuals who \"defend the racist and barbaric policies\" of the United States, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the Arab world.\n\nMassad refers to the Palestinian Authority as the \"Palestinian Collaborationist Authority,\" calls Mahmoud Abbas the \"chief Palestinian collaborator,\" and accuses the PA of collaborating with Israel and the United States to crush Palestinian resistance.\n\nIn 2004, a pro-Israel activist organization, the David Project, produced a film, \"Columbia Unbecoming\", interviewing students who claimed that Massad and other Columbia professors had intimidated or been unfair to them for their pro-Israel views. This eventually sparked the appointment of an Ad Hoc Grievance Committee by the university to investigate the complaints. In response to the film, United States Representative Anthony Weiner called on Columbia to fire Massad for what Weiner characterized as \"anti-Semitic rantings.\"\n\nThe Ad Hoc Grievance Committee, which concluded its work in April 2005, dismissed most of the allegations against Massad, writing in its report that it had \"no basis for believing that Professor Massad systematically suppressed dissenting views in his classroom.\" and stated that they \"found no evidence of any statements made by the faculty that could reasonably be construed as anti-semitic.\" The committee found it credible that Massad was angered by a question in class from a student that he understood to be defending Israel's conduct toward Palestinians and that his response \"exceeded commonly accepted bounds by conveying that her question merited harsh public criticism\", but it also described an environment of incivility, with pro-Israel students disrupting lectures on Middle Eastern studies.\n\nCritics described the committee's findings as a whitewash.\n\nIn response to the investigation of Massad and other professors by Columbia, Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, expressed concern that it would become an inquisition into the political views of professors, and that there was a \"political agenda\" motivating the complaints. Lieberman previously had met with some of the Columbia students who have made the allegations featured in \"Columbia Unbecoming\" and said in an interview that it was \"wrong to accept these allegations at face value\".\n\nMassad continues to deny the one allegation that the report found \"credible.\" Two students beside his accuser said that they witnessed the incident, but a teaching assistant said on WNYC in April 2005 that she was present and that Massad did not angrily criticize the student in question; after the release of the report, 20 students signed a letter stating that they were in class on the day of the alleged incident, and that the incident had never happened.\n\nIn an editorial discussing the case one week after the release of the Committee report, the \"New York Times\" noted that, while it believed Massad had been guilty of inappropriate behavior, it found the controversy overblown and professors such as Massad themselves victimized:\n\nThere is no evidence that anyone's grade suffered for challenging the pro-Palestinian views of any teacher or that any professors made anti-Semitic statements. The professors who were targeted have legitimate complaints themselves. Their classes were infiltrated by hecklers and surreptitious monitors, and they received hate mail and death threats. The panel had no mandate to examine the quality and fairness of teaching. That leaves the university to follow up on complaints about politicized courses and a lack of scholarly rigor as part of its effort to upgrade the department.\n\nA review by Massad of the book \"Palestinian Art\", written by Israeli art history professor Gannit Ankori, was threatened by a libel suit in Britain. In the review, Massad accused Ankori of illegitimately appropriating the work of Kamal Boullata, a Palestinian artist and art historian, a charge which Ankori viewed as defamatory.\n\nThe review appeared in Art Journal, a publication of the College Art Association of America, (CAA). To avoid a libel suit, the CAA agreed to issue an apology to Ms. Ankori, to pay her $75,000.00 and to send a letter to its institutional subscribers, stating that the Massad review \"contained factual errors and certain unfounded assertions.\" Massad acknowledged \"minor errors\", but not libel, and accused the CAA of cowardice. CAA executive director Linda Downs told the \"Forward\" that, while \"there were mistakes\" in the review, the journal agreed to pay only because it could not afford to fight out the case.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "16366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16366", "title": "Jurisprudence", "text": "Jurisprudence\n\nJurisprudence or legal theory is the theoretical study of law, principally by philosophers but, from the twentieth century, also by social scientists. Scholars of jurisprudence, also known as jurists or legal theorists, hope to obtain a deeper understanding of legal reasoning, legal systems, legal institutions, and the role of law in society.\n\nModern jurisprudence began in the 18th century and was focused on the first principles of the natural law, civil law, and the law of nations. General jurisprudence can be divided into categories both by the type of question scholars seek to answer and by the theories of jurisprudence, or schools of thought, regarding how those questions are best answered. Contemporary philosophy of law, which deals with general jurisprudence, addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution as law relates to the larger political and social situation in which it exists.\n\nThis article distinguishes three distinct branches of thought in general jurisprudence. To begin with, ancient natural law, as a major branch and theory of jurisprudence, is the idea that there are rational objective limits to the power of legislative rulers. The foundations of law are accessible through reason and it is from these laws of nature that human-created laws gain whatever force they have. Secondly, 'clarificatory' or analytic jurisprudence rejects natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. It espouses the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to aspects of legal systems. It comprises different theories of jurisprudence. For example, \"legal positivism\", holds that there is no necessary connection between law and morality and that the force of law comes from some basic social facts. And \"legal realism\" argues that the real world practice of law is what determines what law is; the law has the force that it does because of what legislators, lawyers and judges do with it. Thirdly, normative jurisprudence is concerned with \"evaluative\" theories of law. It deals with what the goal or purpose of law is, or what moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law. Besides the question \"What is law?\", it tries to answer what the proper function of law was, or what sorts of acts should be subject to legal sanctions, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted.\n\nThe English word is based on the Latin maxim \"jurisprudentia\": \"juris\" is the genitive form of \"jus\" meaning \"law\", and \"prudentia\" means \"prudence\" (also: discretion, foresight, forethought, circumspection; refers to the exercise of good judgment, common sense, and even caution, especially in the conduct of practical matters). The word is first attested in English in 1628, at a time when the word \"prudence\" had the meaning of \"knowledge of or skill in a matter\". The word may have come via the French \"jurisprudence\", which is attested earlier.\n\nAncient Indian jurisprudence is available in various Dharmaśāstra texts starting from the Dharmasutra of Bhodhayana. Jurisprudence already had this meaning in Ancient Rome even if at its origins the discipline was a (\"periti\") in the \"jus\" of \"mos maiorum\" (traditional law), a body of oral laws and customs verbally transmitted \"by father to son\". Praetors established a workable body of laws by judging whether or not singular cases were capable of being prosecuted either by the edicta, the annual pronunciation of prosecutable offense, or in extraordinary situations, additions made to the edicta. An iudex then would judge a remedy according to the facts of the case.\n\nTheir sentences were supposed to be simple interpretations of the traditional customs, but effectively it was an activity that, apart from formally reconsidering for each case what precisely was traditionally in the legal habits, soon turned also to a more equitable interpretation, coherently adapting the law to the newer social instances. The law was then implemented with new evolutive \"Institutiones\" (legal concepts), while remaining in the traditional scheme. Praetors were replaced in the 3rd century BC by a laical body of \"prudentes\". Admission to this body was conditional upon proof of competence or experience.\n\nUnder the Roman Empire, schools of law were created, and the activity constantly became more academic. In the age from the early Roman Empire to the 3rd century, a relevant literature was produced by some notable groups including the Proculians and Sabinians. The scientific depth of the studies was unprecedented in ancient times.\n\nAfter the 3rd century, \"Juris prudentia\" became a more bureaucratic activity, with few notable authors. It was during the Eastern Roman Empire (5th century) that legal studies were once again undertaken in depth, and it is from this cultural movement that Justinian's Corpus Juris Civilis was born.\n\nIn its general context, natural law theory may be compared to both state-of-nature law and general law understood on the basis of an analogy to the physical laws of science. Natural law is often contrasted to positive law which asserts law as the product of human activity and human volition.\n\nAnother approach to natural law jurisprudence generally asserts that human law may be supported by decisive reasons for action. In other words, there must be a compelling rationale behind following human law. There are two readings of the natural law jurisprudential stance.\nNotions of an objective moral order, external to human legal systems, underlie natural law. What is right or wrong can vary according to the interests one is focused upon. Natural law is sometimes identified with the maxim that \"an unjust law is no law at all\", but as John Finnis, the most important of modern natural barristers has argued, this maxim is a poor guide to the classical Thomist position. Strongly related to theories of natural law are classical theories of justice, beginning in the West with Plato's Republic.\n\nAristotle is often said to be the father of natural law. Like his philosophical forefathers Socrates and Plato, Aristotle posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (\"dikaion physikon\", \"δικαίον φυσικόν\", Latin \"ius naturale\"). His association with natural law is largely due to the way in which he was interpreted by Thomas Aquinas. This was based on Aquinas' conflation of natural law and natural right, the latter of which Aristotle posits in Book V of the \"Nicomachean Ethics\" (= Book IV of the \"Eudemian Ethics\"). Aquinas's influence was such as to affect a number of early translations of these passages, though more recent translations render them more literally.\n\nAristotle's theory of justice is bound up in his idea of the golden mean. Indeed, his treatment of what he calls \"political justice\" derives from his discussion of \"the just\" as a moral virtue derived as the mean between opposing vices, just like every other virtue he describes. His longest discussion of his theory of justice occurs in \"Nicomachean Ethics\" and begins by asking what sort of mean a just act is. He argues that the term \"justice\" actually refers to two different but related ideas: general justice and particular justice. When a person's actions are completely virtuous in all matters in relation to others, Aristotle calls them \"just\" in the sense of \"general justice;\" as such this idea of justice is more or less coextensive with virtue. \"Particular\" or \"partial justice\", by contrast, is the part of \"general justice\" or the individual virtue that is concerned with treating others equitably. Aristotle moves from this unqualified discussion of justice to a qualified view of political justice, by which he means something close to the subject of modern jurisprudence. Of political justice, Aristotle argues that it is partly derived from nature and partly a matter of convention. This can be taken as a statement that is similar to the views of modern natural law theorists. But it must also be remembered that Aristotle is describing a view of morality, not a system of law, and therefore his remarks as to nature are about the grounding of the morality enacted as law, not the laws themselves. The passage here is silent as to that question.\n\nThe best evidence of Aristotle's having thought there was a natural law comes from the \"Rhetoric\", where Aristotle notes that, aside from the \"particular\" laws that each people has set up for itself, there is a \"common\" law that is according to nature. The context of this remark, however, suggests only that Aristotle thought that it could be rhetorically advantageous to appeal to such a law, especially when the \"particular\" law of one's own city was adverse to the case being made, not that there actually was such a law; Aristotle, moreover, considered two of the three candidates for a universally valid, natural law suggested in this passage to be wrong. Aristotle's theoretical paternity of the natural law tradition is consequently disputed.\n\nThomas Aquinas, [Thomas of Aquin, or Aquino] (c. 1225 – 7 March 1274) was an Italian philosopher and theologian in the scholastic tradition, known as \"Doctor Angelicus, Doctor Universalis\". He is the foremost classical proponent of natural theology, and the father of the Thomistic school of philosophy, for a long time the primary philosophical approach of the Roman Catholic Church. The work for which he is best known is the \"Summa Theologica\". One of the thirty-five Doctors of the Church, he is considered by many Catholics to be the Church's greatest theologian. Consequently, many institutions of learning have been named after him.\n\nAquinas distinguished four kinds of law: eternal, natural, human and divine:\n\n\nNatural law, of course, is based on \"first principles\":\n\n\"... this is the first precept of the law, that good is to be done and promoted, and evil is to be avoided. All other precepts of the natural law are based on this ...\"\n\nThe desires to live and to procreate are counted by Aquinas among those basic (natural) human values on which all other human values are based.\n\nFrancisco de Vitoria was perhaps the first to develop a theory of \"ius gentium\" (the rights of peoples), and thus is an important figure in the transition to modernity. He extrapolated his ideas of legitimate sovereign power to society at the international level, concluding that this scope as well ought to be ruled by just forms respectable of the rights of all. The common good of the world is of a category superior to the good of each state. This meant that relations between states ought to pass from being justified by force to being justified by law and justice. Some scholars have upset the standard account of the origins of International law, which emphasises the seminal text \"De iure belli ac pacis\" by Grotius, and argued for Vitoria and, later, Suárez's importance as forerunners and, potentially, founders of the field. Others, such as Koskenniemi, have argued that none of these humanist and scholastic thinkers can be understood to have founded international law in the modern sense, instead placing its origins in the post-1870 period.\n\nFrancisco Suárez, regarded as among the greatest scholastics after Aquinas, subdivided the concept of \"ius gentium\". Working with already well-formed categories, he carefully distinguished \"ius inter gentes\" from \"ius intra gentes\". \"Ius inter gentes\" (which corresponds to modern international law) was something common to the majority of countries, although, being positive law, not natural law, was not necessarily universal. On the other hand, \"ius intra gentes\", or civil law, is specific to each nation.\n\nIn his treatise \"Leviathan, (1651)\", Hobbes expresses a view of natural law as a precept, or general rule, found out by reason, by which a man is forbidden to do that which is destructive of his life, or takes away the means of preserving the same; and to omit that by which he thinks it may best be preserved. Hobbes was a social contractarian and believed that the law gained peoples' tacit consent. He believed that society was formed from a state of nature to protect people from the state of war between mankind that exists otherwise. Life is, without an ordered society, \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\". It is commonly commented that Hobbes' views about the core of human nature were influenced by his times. The English Civil War and the Cromwellian dictatorship had taken place, and he felt absolute authority vested in a monarch, whose subjects obeyed the law, was the basis of a civilized society.\n\nWriting after World War II, Lon L. Fuller defended a secular and procedural form of natural law. He notably emphasised that the (natural) law must meet certain formal requirements (such as being impartial and publicly knowable). To the extent that an institutional system of social control falls short of these requirements, Fuller argues, we are less inclined to recognise it as a system of law, or to give it our respect. Thus, law has an internal morality that goes beyond the social rules by which valid laws are made.\n\nSophisticated positivist and natural law theories sometimes resemble each other more than the above descriptions might suggest, and they may concede certain points to the other \"side\". Identifying a particular theorist as a positivist or a natural law theorist sometimes involves matters of emphasis and degree, and the particular influences on the theorist's work. In particular, the older natural lawyers, such as Aquinas and John Locke made no distinction between analytic and normative jurisprudence. But modern natural lawyers, such as John Finnis claim to be positivists, while still arguing that law is a basically moral creature. His book \"Natural Law and Natural Rights\" (1980, 2011) is a restatement of natural law doctrine.\n\nAnalytic, or 'clarificatory', jurisprudence means the use of a neutral point of view and descriptive language when referring to the aspects of legal systems. This was a philosophical development that rejected natural law's fusing of what law is and what it ought to be. David Hume famously argued in \"A Treatise of Human Nature\" that people invariably slip between describing that the world \"is\" a certain way to saying therefore we \"ought\" to conclude on a particular course of action. But as a matter of pure logic, one cannot conclude that we \"ought\" to do something merely because something \"is\" the case. So analysing and clarifying the way the world \"is\" must be treated as a strictly separate question to normative and evaluative \"ought\" questions.\n\nThe most important questions of analytic jurisprudence are: \"What are laws?\"; \"What is \"the\" law?\"; \"What is the relationship between law and power/sociology?\"; and \"What is the relationship between law and morality?\" Legal positivism is the dominant theory, although there are a growing number of critics who offer their own interpretations.\n\nHistorical jurisprudence came to prominence during the German debate over the proposed codification of German law. In his book \"On the Vocation of Our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence\", Friedrich Carl von Savigny argued that Germany did not have a legal language that would support codification because the traditions, customs and beliefs of the German people did not include a belief in a code. The Historicists believe that the law originates with society.\n\nThe effort to inform jurisprudence systematically with sociological insights developed strongly from the beginning of the twentieth century, as sociology began to establish itself as a distinct social science, especially in the United States and in continental Europe. In Germany the work of the 'free law' theorists (e.g. Ernst Fuchs, Hermann Kantorowicz and Eugen Ehrlich) encouraged the use of sociological insights in judicial development of law and juristic theory. The most internationally influential advocacy of a 'sociological jurisprudence' occurred in the United States, where Roscoe Pound, for many years the Dean of Harvard Law School, used this term to characterise his legal philosophy throughout the first half of the twentieth century. In the United States many later writers followed Pound's lead or developed distinctive approaches to sociological jurisprudence. In Australia, Julius Stone strongly defended and developed Pound's ideas. In the 1930s a significant split between the sociological jurists and the American legal realists emerged. In the second half of the twentieth century sociological jurisprudence as a distinct movement declined as jurisprudence came more strongly under the influence of analytical legal philosophy but with increasing criticism of dominant orientations of Anglophone legal philosophy in the present century it has attracted renewed interest.\n\nPositivism simply means that law is something that is \"posited\": laws are validly made in accordance with socially accepted rules. The positivist view on law can be seen to cover two broad principles: Firstly, that laws may seek to enforce justice, morality, or any other normative end, but their success or failure in doing so does not determine their validity. Provided a law is properly formed, in accordance with the rules recognized in the society concerned, it is a valid law, regardless of whether it is \"just\" by some other standard. Secondly, that law is nothing more than a set of rules to provide order and governance of society. No legal positivist, however, argues that it follows that the law is therefore to be obeyed, no matter what. This is seen as a separate question entirely.\n\nOne of the earliest legal positivists was Jeremy Bentham. Bentham was an early and staunch supporter of the utilitarian concept (along with Hume), an avid prison reformer, advocate for democracy, and strong atheist. Bentham's views about law and jurisprudence were popularized by his student, John Austin. Austin was the first chair of law at the new University of London from 1829. Austin's utilitarian answer to \"what is law?\" was that law is \"commands, backed by threat of sanctions, from a sovereign, to whom people have a habit of obedience\". Contemporary legal positivists have long abandoned this view, and have criticised its oversimplification, H. L. A. Hart particularly.\n\nHans Kelsen is considered one of the prominent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential in Europe and Latin America, although less so in common-law countries. His Pure Theory of Law aims to describe law as binding norms while at the same time refusing, itself, to evaluate those norms. That is, 'legal science' is to be separated from 'legal politics'. Central to the Pure Theory of Law is the notion of a 'basic norm (Grundnorm)'—a hypothetical norm, presupposed by the jurist, from which in a hierarchy all 'lower' norms in a legal system, beginning with constitutional law, are understood to derive their authority or 'bindingness'. In this way, Kelsen contends, the bindingness of legal norms, their specifically 'legal' character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or—of great importance in his time—a personified State or Nation.\n\nIn the Anglophone world, the pivotal writer was H. L. A. Hart, who argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules. Hart rejected Kelsen's views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon, like law, can not be grounded in non-normative social facts. Hart revived analytical jurisprudence as an important theoretical debate in the twentieth century through his book \"The Concept of Law\". As the professor of jurisprudence at Oxford University, Hart argued that law is a 'system of rules'.\n\nRules, said Hart, are divided into primary rules (rules of conduct) and secondary rules (rules addressed to officials to administer primary rules). Secondary rules are divided into rules of adjudication (to resolve legal disputes), rules of change (allowing laws to be varied) and the rule of recognition (allowing laws to be identified as valid). The \"rule of recognition\" is a customary practice of the officials (especially barristers and judges) that identifies certain acts and decisions as sources of law. A pivotal book on Hart was written by Neil MacCormick in 1981 (second edition due in 2007), which further refined and offered some important criticisms that led MacCormick to develop his own theory (the best example of which is his recently published \"Institutions of Law\", 2007). Other important critiques have included that of Ronald Dworkin, John Finnis, and Joseph Raz.\n\nIn recent years, debates about the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained. One important debate is within legal positivism. One school is sometimes called \"exclusive legal positivism\", and it is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness. A second school is labeled \"inclusive legal positivism\", a major proponent of which is Wil Waluchow, and it is associated with the view that moral considerations \"may\" determine the legal validity of a norm, but that it is not necessary that this is the case.\n\nSome philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that there is \"no necessary connection\" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists, including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).\n\nJoseph Raz defends the positivist outlook, but criticised Hart's \"soft social thesis\" approach in \"The Authority of Law\". Raz argues that law is authority, identifiable purely through social sources, without reference to moral reasoning. Any categorisation of rules beyond their role as authority is better left to sociology than to jurisprudence.\n\nLegal realism was a view popular with some Scandinavian and American writers. Skeptical in tone, it held that the law should be understood and determined by the actual practices of courts, law offices, and police stations, rather than as the rules and doctrines set forth in statutes or learned treatises. It had some affinities with the sociology of law and sociological jurisprudence. The essential tenet of legal realism is that all law is made by human beings and, thus, is subject to human foibles, frailties and imperfections.\n\nIt has become common today to identify Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., as the main precursor of American Legal Realism (other influences include Roscoe Pound, Karl Llewellyn and Justice Benjamin Cardozo). Karl Llewellyn, another founder of the U.S. legal realism movement, similarly believed that the law is little more than putty in the hands of judges who are able to shape the outcome of cases based on their personal values or policy choices. The chief inspiration for Scandinavian legal realism many consider to be the works of Axel Hägerström.\n\nDespite its decline in popularity, realism continues to influence a wide spectrum of jurisprudential schools today, including critical legal studies, feminist legal theory, critical race theory, sociology of law and law and economics.\n\nCritical legal studies are a younger theory of jurisprudence that has developed since the 1970s. It can be generally traced to American legal realism and is considered \"the first movement in legal theory and legal scholarship in the United States to have espoused a committed Left political stance and perspective\". It holds that the law is largely contradictory, and can be best analyzed as an expression of the policy goals of a dominant social group.\n\nKarl Popper originated the theory of critical rationalism. According to Reinhold Zippelius many advances in law and jurisprudence take place by operations of critical rationalism. He writes, \"daß die Suche nach dem Begriff des Rechts, nach seinen Bezügen zur Wirklichkeit und nach der Gerechtigkeit experimentierend voranschreitet, indem wir Problemlösungen versuchsweise entwerfen, überprüfen und verbessern\" (that we empirically search solutions of problems, which harmonise fair with the reality: by projecting, testing and improving the solutions).\n\nContemporary philosopher of law Ronald Dworkin has advocated a more constructivist theory of jurisprudence that can be characterized as a middle path between natural law theories and positivist theories of general jurisprudence. \nIn his book \"Law's Empire\" Dworkin attacked Hart and the positivists for their refusal to treat law as a moral issue. He argues that law is an 'interpretive' concept, that requires barristers to find the best-fitting and most just solution to a legal dispute, given their constitutional traditions. According to him, law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the morally best justification for the institutional facts and practices that we intuitively regard as legal. It follows on Dworkin's view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some moral truths about the justifications for the practices in that society. It is consistent with Dworkin's view—in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists—that \"no-one\" in a society may know what its laws are, because no-one may know the best justification for its practices.\n\nInterpretation, according to Dworkin's \"integrity theory of law\", has two dimensions. To count as an interpretation, the reading of a text must meet the criterion of \"fit\". Of those interpretations that fit, however, Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that puts the political practices of the community in their best light, or makes of them \"the best that they can be\". But many writers have doubted whether there \"is\" a single best justification for the complex practices of any given community, and others have doubted whether, even if there are, they should be counted as part of the law of that community.\n\nConsequences from the operation of legal rules or legal procedures—or from the behavior of legal actors (such as lawyers and judges)—may be either beneficial (therapeutic) or harmful (anti-therapeutic) to people. Therapeutic jurisprudence (\"TJ\") studies law as a social force (or agent) and uses social science methods and data to study the extent to which a legal rule or practice affects the psychological well-being of the people it affects.\n\nIn addition to the question, \"What is law?\", legal philosophy is also concerned with normative, or \"evaluative\" theories of law. What is the goal or purpose of law? What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law? What is the proper function of law? What sorts of acts should be subject to punishment, and what sorts of punishment should be permitted? What is justice? What rights do we have? Is there a duty to obey the law? What value has the rule of law? Some of the different schools and leading thinkers are as follows.\n\nAretaic moral theories such as contemporary virtue ethics emphasize the role of character in morality. Virtue jurisprudence is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous characters by citizens. Historically, this approach is associated mainly with Aristotle or Thomas Aquinas later. Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics.\n\nDeontology is \"the theory of duty or moral obligation.\" The philosopher Immanuel Kant formulated one influential deontological theory of law. He argued that any rule we follow must be able to be universally applied, i.e. we must be willing for everyone to follow that rule. A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin.\n\nUtilitarianism is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences for the greatest number of people possible. Historically, utilitarian thinking about law is associated with the philosopher Jeremy Bentham. John Stuart Mill was a pupil of Bentham's and was the torch bearer for utilitarian philosophy through the late nineteenth century. In contemporary legal theory, the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the law and economics tradition.\n\nJohn Rawls was an American philosopher, a professor of political philosophy at Harvard University and author of \"A Theory of Justice\" (1971), \"Political Liberalism\", \"\", and \"The Law of Peoples\". He is widely considered one of the most important English-language political philosophers of the 20th century. His theory of justice uses a device called the original position to ask us which principles of justice we would choose to regulate the basic institutions of our society if we were behind a 'veil of ignorance.' Imagine we do not know who we are - our race, sex, wealth status, class, or any distinguishing feature - so that we would not be biased in our own favour. Rawls argues from this 'original position' that we would choose exactly the same political liberties for everyone, like freedom of speech, the right to vote and so on. Also, we would choose a system where there is only inequality because that produces incentives enough for the economic well-being of all society, especially the poorest. This is Rawls's famous 'difference principle'. Justice is fairness, in the sense that the fairness of the original position of choice guarantees the fairness of the principles chosen in that position.\n\nThere are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law, including critical legal studies and libertarian theories of law.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50276542", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50276542", "title": "Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix", "text": "Legal issues and controversies surrounding Netflix\n\nNetflix is an American global provider of streaming films and television series. Since its launch in 1998, it has been at the centre of numerous legal issues and controversies.\n\nIn 2006, Netflix held the first Netflix Prize competition to find a better program to predict user preferences and beat its existing Netflix movie recommendation system, known as Cinematch, by at least 10%. CEO Hastings did not necessarily expect a lot of quick progress towards the prize, \"We thought we built the best darn thing ever.\" But by June 2007, Hastings said the competition is \"three-quarters of the way there in three-quarters of a year.\" Three teams – an AT&T Research Team called BellKor, commendo's team BigChaos, and Pragmatic Theory – combined to win the 2009 grand prize competition for $1 million. The winning team, called BellKor's Pragmatic Chaos, used machine learning techniques to find that, for example, the rating system people use for older movies is very different from that used for a movie they just saw. The mood of the day made a difference also; for example, Friday ratings were different from Monday morning ratings.\n\nIn 2010, Netflix canceled a running contest to improve the company's recommendation algorithm due to privacy concerns: under the terms of the competition, contestants were given access to customer rental data, which the company had purportedly anonymized. However, it was discovered that even this anonymized dataset could, in fact, identify a user personally. Netflix was sued by KamberLaw L.L.C. and ended the contest after reaching a deal with the FTC.\n\nNetflix's DVD allocation policy – referred to by many as \"throttling\" – gives priority shipping and selection to customers who rent fewer discs per month. Higher volume renters may see some of their selections delayed, routed elsewhere, or sent out of order. Netflix claims that \"the large majority of our subscribers are able to receive their movies in about one business day following our shipment of the requested movie from their local distribution center.\" However, not all shipments come from the subscriber's local distribution center, and shipments from distant centers are often delayed, as well.\n\nIn September 2004, a consumer class action lawsuit, \"Frank Chavez v. Netflix, Inc.\", was brought against Netflix in San Francisco Superior Court. The suit alleged false advertising in relation to claims of \"unlimited rentals\" with \"one-day delivery.\" In January 2005, Netflix changed its terms of use to acknowledge \"throttling\" (Mike Kaltschnee, owner of the Hacking Netflix blog, says Netflix calls this practice \"smoothing\" internally).\n\nIn October 2005, Netflix proposed a settlement for those who had enrolled as a paid Netflix member prior to January 15, 2005. These earlier members would be able to renew their subscriptions with a one-month free membership, and those early members with current subscriptions would receive a one-month free upgrade to the next-highest membership level. Netflix's settlement denied allegations of any wrongdoing, and the case did not reach a legal judgment. Netflix estimated the settlement cost approximately US$4 million, which included up to US$2.53 million to cover plaintiff lawyer fees. A controversial aspect of the settlement offer was that the customer's account would continue at the renewed or upgraded membership level after the free month provided by the settlement, with customers being charged accordingly unless they opted out after the month-long free period ended. After Trial Lawyers for Public Justice filed a challenge to the proposed settlement and the Federal Trade Commission filed an amicus brief urging the rejection or modification of the settlement, Netflix offered to alter the settlement terms, requiring customers to actively approve any continuation after the free month. The final settlement hearing took place on March 22, 2006. Implementation of the settlement was delayed pending appeal in the California Appellate Courts. The settlement was affirmed on April 21, 2008, with the court stating, \"the trial court did not abuse its discretion in approving the amended class action settlement agreement, approving the notice given to class members, or determining the amount of fees.\" The court approved email notice and an online claims submission process. The court said:\n\nThe summary notice and long-form notice together provided all of the detail required by statute or court rule, in a highly accessible form. The fact that not all of the information was contained in a single e-mail or mailing is immaterial ... Using a summary notice that directed the class member wanting more information to a Web site containing a more detailed notice, and provided hyperlinks to that Web site, was a perfectly acceptable manner of giving notice in this case ... The class members conducted business with defendant over the Internet, and can be assumed to know how to navigate between the summary notice and the Web site. Using the capability of the Internet in that fashion was a sensible and efficient way of providing notice, especially compared to the alternative Vogel apparently preferred—mailing out a lengthy legalistic document that few class members would have been able to plow through.\nThe settlement was criticized because it paid out $2.5 million to attorneys for fees and costs, while offering only coupons to the class members.\n\nThe Terms of Use have since been amended with terms that indicate such a suit would not be possible in the future:\n\nThese Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without regard to conflicts of laws provisions. You and Netflix agree that the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and/or the California Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute between you and Netflix relating in any way to the Netflix service or Web site or these Terms of Use. You and Netflix expressly and irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in these courts. The parties agree that in any such dispute or subsequent legal action, they will only assert claims in an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis, and that they will not seek or agree to serve as a named representative in a class action or seek relief on behalf of those other than themselves.\n\nThe Netflix website at one time featured a list of titles, \"Releasing This Week\" (RTW), that enabled customers to easily view new DVDs the company planned for rental release each week. On December 21, 2007, the company removed the link to the page without notice and replaced it with a slider system showing only four previously released movies at a time. The new page, called \"Popular New Releases\", does not list newly released DVDs for rental. The listing of new releases is still active, although there is no menu option that links to the page.\n\nOn January 1, 2008, a Netflix employee unofficially stated on the Netflix Community Blog that customers used the RTW page to add newly released movies to the top of their queues, then complained about delays in receiving them after demand outstripped the supply of DVDs on hand. By removing the page, Netflix sought to quell complaints that these movies were not readily available. Critics, however, have suggested this was just another Netflix attempt at throttling.\n\nOn April 4, 2006, Netflix filed a patent infringement lawsuit in which it demanded a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Blockbuster's online DVD rental subscription program violated two patents held by Netflix. The first cause of action alleged Blockbuster's infringement of U.S. Patent No. 7,024,381 (issued April 4, 2006; only hours before the lawsuit was filed) by copying the \"dynamic queue\" of DVDs available for each customer, Netflix's method of using the ranked preferences in the queue to send DVDs to subscribers, and Netflix's method permitting the queue to be updated and reordered. The second cause of action alleged infringement of Patent No. 6,584,450 (issued June 24, 2003), which covers in less detail the subscription rental service as well as Netflix's methods of communication and delivery. The dispute ended a year later, on June 25, 2007, with both companies declining to disclose the terms of their legal settlement, except for a statement by Blockbuster that it would not have a major impact on its future financial performance. Blockbuster also said that the company planned to close 282 stores that year to shift focus to its online service. The company had already closed 290 stores in 2006.\n\nIn fall 2006, Blockbuster signed a deal with The Weinstein Company that gave it the exclusive rental rights to the studio's films beginning on January 1, 2007. This agreement forced Netflix to obtain copies from mass merchants or retailers, instead of directly from the studio. Netflix has speculated that the effect of the Blockbuster-Weinstein agreement could result in higher rental costs and/or fewer copies of the studio's movies, which would limit the number of each movie's DVDs that would be available to subscribers at any one time. , Netflix continues to make available Weinstein movies, including \"Unknown\", \"School For Scoundrels\" and \"Harsh Times\", among others. The first-sale doctrine allows Netflix and other video rental businesses to offer movies released by The Weinstein Company.\n\nBeginning in 2004, Netflix subscribers could use a feature that allowed them to interact with friends who were also members. This feature was meant to tap into the growing popularity of social networking. With this feature, users could see how their friends rated a movie on that movie's page; view what DVDs their friends were renting; and allow them to leave their friends notes with film recommendations.\n\nIn March 2010, as part of a redesign of its movie-details pages, the Friends feature began to be phased out. Users could no longer see their friends' ratings on movie pages, and what remained of the friends section was moved to a small link at the bottom of each page. The initial announcement about the redesign on Netflix's official blog made no reference to any changes to the Friends feature. Hundreds of angry users posted negative comments, and the feedback prompted Netflix's Vice President of Product Management, Todd Yellin, to post a follow-up statement. While apologizing for poor communication about the changes, Yellin stated that the Friends feature would continue to be phased out, citing figures that only 2% of members used the feature and the company's limited resources to maintain the service. Netflix users also began using the movie-reviews section of the website to post comments protesting against the changes.\n\nNetflix formerly supported online streaming only on Microsoft Windows, macOS, iOS and Android, relying on Microsoft Silverlight. Partly due to digital rights management issues, despite the open-source implementation of Silverlight known as Moonlight, this has created problems for users of fully open source versions of Linux and similar operating systems. Though Google's partially proprietary Android and Chrome OS platforms are essentially based upon Linux and other free software infrastructure, Netflix did not provide any crossover support for using its proprietary components to stream any of its content upon more free systems, such as Ubuntu and Fedora, although this changed in October 2014.\n\nOn August 9, 2011, Netflix released a Google Chrome web store item for Chrome OS, Mac OS, and Windows; however, it did not initially enable Netflix streaming on Linux machines. On Linux systems running the Chrome browser, the extension simply redirects users to view Netflix.com.\n\nIn June 2014, Netflix chose to switch from Silverlight to HTML5 playback using Encrypted Media Extensions (EME), since then, the extensions were added to Microsoft's Internet Explorer on Windows 8.1 and Apple's Safari on OS X Yosemite. It was implemented in Google Chrome on all platforms shortly afterward.\n\nAs of October 10, 2014 multiple versions of Linux including Ubuntu and PCLinuxOS claim support for Netflix in Google Chrome version 37 or newer. The website for PCWorld also states that users of other Linux distributions such as version 17 of Linux Mint have been successfully using Netflix via Google Chrome without any special workarounds.\n\n, Google had initially released plans for a plugin for the Chrome browser and Chrome OS which would allow Netflix streaming, including traditional Linux users.\n\nOn November 15, 2012, patches to the Wine compatibility layer to make viewing of Netflix on Linux and similar systems were made available.\n\nOn November 18, 2012, a PPA and installation files were made publicly available making the installation and use of Netflix much easier for users of Ubuntu 12.04 and possibly other distributions.\n\nOn August 8, 2013, software repositories were made publicly available making possible the usage of the Windows Silverlight plugin in Linux-native web browsers using Wine. Previous Linux Netflix support required running the entire Firefox web browser through the Wine compatibility layer.\n\nOn March 11, 2011, Don Cullen filed a national class action lawsuit against Netflix alleging that the service failed to closed caption its streaming video library and had misled deaf and hard of hearing customers. In June 2011, the National Association of the Deaf represented by the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund (DREDF) filed a lawsuit against Netflix for not providing closed captioning on all of its movies on the \"Watch Instantly\" service. The group claims Netflix is violating the Americans with Disabilities Act by not providing equal access on entertainment. On November 11, 2011, the court denied Netflix a motion to dismiss the case. In 2015, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals dismissed the suit, saying the Americans with Disabilities Act applies only to physical spaces, not online.\n\nIn March 2012, Netflix increased the number of programs that are closed captioned. Almost all Netflix-ready devices in distribution today (including AppleTV, BD players, the Roku set-top box, and all the game consoles, phone apps, tablet apps, and TVs) are capable of rendering captions.\n\nIn July 2012, Netflix formed an experimental project to crowdsource the closed-captioning effort using the Amara (formerly Universal Subtitles) platform. However, this proved problematic in the face of claims that crowdsourced subtitles, regardless of whether they are transcriptions or translations, are derivative works which infringe copyright if created or distributed without consent from the film's copyright owner. Amara operates under DMCA safe-harbor provisions which indemnify it from secondary copyright infringement lawsuits over user-uploaded content, and presumably Netflix would not publish any subtitles produced by this effort without authorization. Netflix was careful to say it is not committed to using any subtitles produced by the crowdsourcing project.\n\nIn October 2012, Netflix was found to be offering the television series \"Andromeda\" to customers in Finland with unauthorized subtitles from the fansub scene. Such subtitles, and motion pictures incorporating them, have long been traded online, resulting in cease and desist notices, takedowns, and copyright infringement lawsuits against traders, website operators, and search engines; even criminal prosecution happened in one Norwegian case involving the distribution of fan-created subtitles alone. When confronted, Netflix apologized and promised to remove the unauthorized translations but did not explain how the content came to be offered in the first place, or whether other potentially copyright-infringing subtitles exist in the company's repertoire.\n\nOn January 20, 2014, Jon Christian published an article in \"The Week\", titled \"How Netflix alienated and insulted its deaf subscribers: The streaming video giant still can't manage to competently produce closed captions\", which catalogues Netflix's various technical and legal issues regarding closed captioning, including the poor quality of the subtitles that are provided. For example, he states: \"But for all the service's strengths, one aspect is still decidedly twentieth century: The bizarrely low standards for Netflix's closed captions, which continue to alienate subscribers who are deaf, hard of hearing, or simply have difficulty understanding dialogue.\" The article was updated the following day to publish Netflix's response: \"Update: The day after this article was published, a representative from Netflix contacted the author of this piece with an additional comment: 'While we don't have the rights to make edits to subs/captions we do, in fact, request redelivery of subtitles or captions when we discover errors. The titles in your piece are now under investigation.'\"\n\nFollowing the launch of \"Daredevil\" in 2015, disability rights advocates pointed out that Netflix had not yet included content with audio descriptions of visual content for those who are blind or visually impaired. One critic considered it \"terribly laughable PR\" for Netflix to not include audio descriptions on a series that focuses on a character who himself is blind. On April 14, 2015, director of content operations Tracy Wright announced that Netflix would begin to work with studios to add audio descriptions to its original content.\n\nMore than 30 million Netflix subscribers use the service via a proxy server or virtual private network (VPN); doing so can make a user appear to be located in a country other than the one they are actually in, thus allowing them to use the service to access content that Netflix cannot offer in their region, due to geographical licensing restrictions. It is unclear whether accessing geo-blocked content via VPN violates local copyright laws, but content providers and other broadcasters have asserted that it is illegal because it infringes local rights to content that may have been sold to a competitor. GlobalWebIndex showed about 20 million of such VPN users came from China alone. As of November 2013, Canadian Netflix offered 3,600 titles compared to the U.S. service which had more than 10,000 which results in Canadians using VPNs so they can access the larger U.S. content selection.\n\nIn a leaked e-mail revealed by the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack in 2014, Sony Pictures Television's president of international distribution, Keith LeGoy, described VPN usage of Netflix as being \"semi-sanctioned\" piracy, and he criticized the company for not taking further steps to detect these users and restrict their access to content Netflix had not licensed for their region.\n\nIn response, on January 14, 2016, Netflix announced its intent to strengthen measures to restrict access to unlicensed material, by viewers using VPNs or proxies.\n\nA lawsuit was filed agented Netflix in 2016 by George Keritsis. The suit alleged that Netflix broke the contract it made with millions of customers who have \"grandfathered\" subscription plans with price guarantees.\n\n20th Century Fox filed a lawsuit in 2016, after Marco Waltenberg and Tara Flynn left the company for Netflix. Its claim argued that Netflix was enticing executives to break their employment contracts with Fox.\n\nOn June 2018, Netflix CCO Jonathan Friedland was fired for saying the word nigger during a company meeting about offensive words. A memo released by Reed Hastings, which stated that he should have used a euphemism, mentioned that Friedland said the word again during a follow-up meeting with human resources. Hastings described the second utterance as \"confirm[ing] a deep lack of understanding\". Days later, an advertising campaign for Netflix launched, which emphasized its black talent.\n"}
{"id": "1341275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1341275", "title": "Leon Levy", "text": "Leon Levy\n\nLeon Levy (September 13, 1925 – April 6, 2003) was an American investor, mutual fund manager, and philanthropist.\n\nBorn to a Jewish family, Levy attended Townsend Harris High School and studied psychology at City College of New York. After serving in the U.S. Army, he began working as a research analyst. He was strongly influenced in his business approach by his father, Jerome Levy, an economist and business executive who emphasized the role corporate profits play in charting the economy's direction.\n\nIn 1956 he became a partner of Oppenheimer & Co. Inc, then in 1959 Levy co-founded the Oppenheimer mutual funds. There he started dozens of mutual funds that, at his death, had grown to manage more than $120 billion. In 1982, he sold both companies to the U.K.'s Mercantile House for $162 million and co-founded Odyssey Partners, a private investment partnership. It grew to be a $3 billion hedge fund before it was dissolved in 1997.\n\nLevy's financial philosophy stressed common sense and the psychology of investors.\n\nIn 1986, to honor his father, he founded the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, now the Levy Institute, at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. The Levy Institute has established itself as a sponsor of extensive work in Keynesian and post-Keynesian economics. In the last year of his life, Levy commuted up the Hudson River from New York City to teach a class at the Levy Institute, \"Contemporary Developments in Finance\", in which he focused on his belief that investing is as much a psychological as it is an economic act.\n\nWhen he died in his late seventies, Levy was estimated to be worth a billion dollars, though his personal wealth might have been substantially higher were it not for his philanthropic interests.\n\nLevy's philanthropy began in the 1950s, when he established the Jerome Levy Foundation, which still exists, giving grants to human rights and land preservation organizations. His donations grew steadily, and during his lifetime, Levy and his wife, Shelby White, gave away more than $200 million, becoming well known for their philanthropic efforts. They donated $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for the construction of the Leon Levy and Shelby White Court, a gallery hosting the largest selection of Hellenistic and Roman artwork ever exhibited at that museum. The gallery included a number of pieces from Levy and White's substantial art collection, which also includes art from the Near East. Between 1997 and 2003, Levy and White donated nearly $5 million to 107 scholars for the publication of archaeological excavations that had been completed but never published. The projects funded by their program, the Shelby White-Leon Levy Program for Archaeological Publications, include excavations at some of the highest profile archaeological sites throughout Greece and the Middle East, including Knossos, Aphrodisias, Kition, Ras Shamra, Sarepta, Mt. Gerizim, Ekron, Lachish, Megiddo, Jerusalem, Pella, Jerash, the Dead Sea Scrolls, Assur, Nineveh, Nuzi, and Tepe Hissar.\n\nThey also funded the Leon Levy Excavation at Ashkelon, Israel; created the Leon Levy Visitor Center at the New York Botanical Garden; and financed the Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind Brain and Behavior at Rockefeller University, where Levy was a member of the Board. Levy also served as President of the Board of the Institute for Advanced Study, Vice Chairman of the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, and was a director of Bard College, and many other not-for-profit boards.\n\nThe Leon Levy Foundation and Shelby White, as Chairman of the Friends of the Israel Antiquities Authority, provided the funds for conserving the extraordinarily well-preserved Lod Mosaic and established the Shelby White and Leon Levy Lod Mosaic Archaeological Center, which will house the mosaic once it returns from its 2010-2016 international exhibition tour.\n\nLong interested in ancient history, Levy in his final years, along with White, began discussions about the creation of a path-breaking institute where advanced scholars would explore trade and cultural links among ancient civilizations.\n\nAfter his death in 2003, Levy’s philanthropy was continued through the Leon Levy Foundation, and one of its earliest initiatives was the fulfillment of that plan. In spring, 2006, the Leon Levy Foundation pledged $200 million to New York University for the creation of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, a center for advanced scholarly research and graduate education, intended to cultivate cross-cultural study of the ancient world, from the western Mediterranean to China.\n\nThe donation created controversy among some academics who believe that collectors of antiquities encourage the looting of ancient sites. In their 2006 book \"The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities – From Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums\", Peter Watson and Cecelia Todeschini lay out the dynamics of the illegal trade in antiquities and use Leon Levy and Shelby White as an example of collectors whose purchases may have led to unethical dealing in artifacts.\n\nOne NYU professor, Randall White, resigned from NYU’s existing Center for Ancient Studies – which is independent of the new Institute for the Study of the Ancient World – saying that he opposed the acceptance of a donation from a foundation whose benefactor had sometimes been associated with such questionable practices and trafficking. Several scholars outside NYU, notably from Bryn Mawr College, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Cincinnati, also commented negatively on NYU's acceptance of the gift. Many other scholars, however, supported the institute and the gift. Professor James McCredie, of the Institute of Fine Arts, NYU's graduate teaching and advanced research center for art history, wrote a letter to Provost David McLaughlin endorsing the project.

{"id": "22076525", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22076525", "title": "Religious alienation", "text": "Religious alienation\n\nReligious alienation is a term some use to describe how religion creates an impediment to human self-understanding.\n\nAlthough the roots of alienation lie far back in the Judeo-Christian tradition, the concept of alienation first gained prominence in the philosophy of Hegel, and particularly in his mature writings. There are signs of the idea in his earlier works, but it is not until the \"Phenomenology of Spirit\" (1807) that alienation occupies a central place in his writings.\n\nIn the opening sections of the \"Phenomenology\", Hegel attacked the views of common sense and simplified natural science that the world consisted of discrete objects independent of man's consciousness. Truth, for Hegel, was not to be found in knowledge that was stripped of any influence from man's own desires and feelings. Ultimately, Hegel considered that there could be no truth that was not intimately linked with the ongoing process of human beings as thinking subjects; truth was their truth. The supposed objectivity of the world of nature was in fact an alienation, for man's task was to discover, behind these appearances, his own essential life and finally to view everything as a facet of his own self-consciousness. The same principle applied to the world of culture in which such spheres as art and religion, if viewed as independent of man, constituted so many alienations to be overcome by integration into the final understanding and recapitulation which was Absolute Knowledge.\n\nHegel had created a system; and all his followers believed that it was the final one. However, when it came to applying the system to particular problems, they conceived his system to be ambivalent. The fact that alienation seemed to them to be a challenge, something to be overcome, led them to put the emphasis on the concepts of dialectic and negativity in Hegel's system; and thus they challenged, first in religion and then in politics, his view that the problem of alienation had, at least in principle, been solved. The foremost among these radical disciples of Hegel, Bruno Bauer, applied the concept of alienation to the religious field. Bauer, who lectured in theology and made his name as a Gospel critic, considered that religious beliefs, and in particular Christianity, caused a division in man's consciousness by becoming opposed to this consciousness as a separate power. Thus religion was an attitude towards the essence of self-consciousness that had become estranged from itself. In this context, Bauer promoted the use of the expression \"self-alienation\" that soon became current among the Young Hegelians.\n\nFor Feuerbach (\"The Essence of Christianity\" (1841)), people alienate their essential being by attributing their human qualities to a god who is then worshipped on account of these qualities. In worshipping god, therefore, people are unconsciously worshipping themselves. Thus Feuerbach argues that religion is a form of alienation which prevents people from attaining realisation of their own species-being. Feuerbach’s thinking has been described as humanist in that his theory of alienation is based on a theory of human nature as species-being, as innate to the human species. This position would later be examined by Karl Marx in his \"Theses on Feuerbach\".\n"}
{"id": "36456126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36456126", "title": "Romantic medicine", "text": "Romantic medicine\n\nRomantic medicine is part of the broader movement known as Romanticism, most predominant in the period 1800–1840, and involved both the cultural (humanities) and natural sciences, not to mention efforts to better understand man within a spiritual context ('spiritual science'). Romanticism in medicine was an integral part of Romanticism in science.\n\nThe impetus for Romantic ideas in medicine came from the Great Britain, and more specifically Scotland - John Hunter (1728–93) - and the idea of life as a principle not reducible to material constructs, and John Brown (1735–88), founder of the Brunonian system of medicine (\"see also\", Romanticism in Scotland#Science). The nexus for Romantic Medicine was Germany, largely nurtured and guided by German natural scientific inquiries regarding the vital aspects of nature, such as that of Johann Friedrich Blumenbach (1752–1840) and his influential ideas regarding a life principle (\"Bildungstrieb\"), a formative drive (\"nisus formatives\") as well as a philosophical tradition that emphasized the dynamic aspects of man and nature, and their essential relationship as part of a unity - German idealism and \"Naturphilosophie\" - all guided by Immanuel Kant's (1724–1804) challenge calling for critical inquiry as the basis for science.\n\nThe essence of romantic medicine was to overcome the deep crisis that Western medicine found itself in during the latter half of the 1700s by means of a science of life (pathology and physiology grounded in history) that went beyond the simple application of the method of the inertial sciences (physics and chemistry, grounded in mathematics) that had worked so well for inert nature, but was found wanting when applied to vital nature, but also a science of life that went beyond the idea of medicine as a subjective art largely to be left to individual practice. The \"Zeitgeist\" of Romantic medicine sought to unite the uneasy partnership of material natural science and subjective clinical practice to create a true scientific foundation for Western medicine (see also Romanticism and epistemology)\n\nThe issue of life – what \"is\" life? – or the scientific inquiry and quest (\"questio\") regarding vital nature was one that increasingly drew the attention of philosophers and scientists in the 1700s, following the great advances concerning the laws and principles of inert nature - the Copernican, Galilean and Newtonian revolutions in celestial and earthly mechanics - astronomy and physics. With great confidence and optimism, philosophy and science turned to the mystery of life, or rather, that of health - how to restore and maintain it. Those most immediately drawn to this field were those who had some concern with health issues, physicians in particular. Thus, a natural alliance formed between natural philosophy and science on the one hand and medicine on the other. What they had in common was to advance the discipline of the study of living functions or physiology.\n\nBecause of the influence of the inertial sciences and the success of the method used to gain knowledge of the laws and principles applying to inert nature, the initial approach was to apply the same method to vital nature. What emerged from this was the extensive study in the first part of the 1700s of ‘irritability’, this being based on the central nervous system and involving physical forces such as electricity and magnetism. However, the mechanico-material explanation was not fruitful when it came to actually dealing with life in the case of healthcare practitioners. Albrecht Von Haller's (1708–77) 'irritability' hypothesis and its failure adequately to explain the phenomenon of life, as well as the waning capacity of the Western mentality to participate living nature that lay at the root of the Hippocratic system of humours (or noetic capacities), led to a split between those who clung to the ancient tradition, but in name only (becoming routinists or empiricists), and those, largely in the universities, who sought a (material-mechanical) scientific basis regarding life and medicine. This split led to a widely acknowledged crisis in Western ‘medicine’ in the latter half of the 1700s.\n\nThe attempt on the part of philosophers and scientists to come to grips with the question of \"life\" led to an emphasis away from mechanics or statics, to dynamics. Life was action, living movement, a manifestation of an underlying polarity in nature and the universe. Instead of seeing nature from a ‘one-eyed, color blind’ spectator perspective, what was needed was a perspective that was binocular and participative. Inertial science had advanced in man's understanding of inert nature, her outer form or shell, what Francis Bacon termed \"natura naturata\" (outer form or appearance). However, it was not capable of going beyond this to a more dynamic discernment or apperception of the living inner content of nature, the domain of life – life in general, not just \"life biological\" as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, at the philosophic core of the scientific effort to penetrate to natura naturans, put it, asking further “what is not life?” based on the understanding of life as a dynamic polarity between powers, forces and energies. As one observer wrote \"Die eigentliche Lebenslehre der Romantik aber war: Polarität.\" But as he promptly adds: \"Sie klingt uns überall entgegen, nicht nur in der Naturphilosophie.\"\n\nThe groundwork for this intensive search to understand life was laid down by Francis Bacon, who sought to sweep clean the Augean stables of late medieval Scholasticism, with its increasingly obtuse and confused attempts to approach \"natura naturans\" (nature becoming or 'naturing') using the old Greek noetic capacity, already long lost to the Western mind and having gone underground into the arts, but also the nominalist straying into abstractions and refractions in their study of \"natura naturata\" via secondary phenomena as in Newton's study of color (cf. Goethe's \"Farbenlehre\" or Study of Color). Neither the Realists nor the Nominalists of late medieval scholasticism could handle the task before them, and Bacon sought, at the start of the Age of Science, to provide a method to approach nature's outer form rationally, but by means of a conscious use of man's higher faculty in the form of the ‘forethoughtful inquiry’ (‘lux siccum’), that is, an inquiry that brought a particular idea, itself evinced through the mind and the domain of true philosophy, namely, the \"mind’s self-experience in the act of thinking\" (Coleridge's \"Biographia Literaria\"), or epistemology. The Baconian approach was further developed by C.S. Peirce who made a distinction between induction and abduction: the latter being the method of discovering hypotheses, the former that of testing them.\n\nBacon's work provided what Coleridge termed ‘method’ – the derivation of laws or ideas to guide the mind (\"mens\") in its observation of nature, out of which emerges understanding (concepts) and principles (reason). It is also the task of philosophy, as Coleridge emphasized, to \"settle the nomenclature,\" as the key to science is terminology where one term is not synonymous with something else, as is the case in demotic language, but instead the term discloses its meaning and increases understanding and knowledge. This was further developed by Heidegger and phenomenology (such as with the term \"Veranlassung\").\n\nGreek philosophy (love of wisdom or \"sophia\") later emerged as philology (love of the Logos) to interpret philosophical works. It is this penetration of nature using both the eductive (as opposed to the projective) arts (innate wisdom) and (Logos-backed) sciences to achieve a rational, conscious understanding of nature, both outer form and inner essence that those who became part of the Romantic movement in England and Germany in particular, were seeking. It is not surprising that Romanticism, a scientific endeavor and quest, involved the cultural sciences or humanities (epistemology, philology, literature, poetry, music, etc.), as well as the natural sciences.\n\nRomanticism rejected the application of the method that had worked so well for inert nature to the realm of living nature, or life biological. While living organisms contained a degree of a mineral, material nature amenable to being approached via the laws of material physics and chemistry, life itself could not thereby be satisfactorily explained. On the one side, the material scientists sought a solution in reducing the non-material or metaphysical to ‘just’ a manifestation of the material, essentially thereby ignoring that this did not at all account for life. On the other side, a part of the ‘Old School’, drawing from the Hippocratic humoral theory (involving non-mechanical, etheric concepts), sought to emphasize the non-physical or vital aspect of nature, which somehow existed above and outside of nature and directed its activities. The Romantic scientists and philosophers rejected both reductionist mechano-materialism (material natural science) and conflationist mystical-idealism (vitalism).\n\nRomanticism also involved a fundamental understanding of functional polarities as the basis for and essence of life as Idea, Law and Principle. One of these polarities in cultural history involved the seminal influence of the English genius and the germinal or gestational genius of German-language culture. Coleridge mentions this in his \"Essays on Method\", and the theme is explored in D.E. Faulkner-Jones' The English Spirit.\n\nThe seminal ideas came from Francis Bacon regarding scientific method and from John Locke regarding the ideas of self-consciousness and mind. Locke set up a relationship between mind (subject) and outer world (object) wherein the mind is set in motion by objects producing sensations but also has an internal activity of its own (reflection) that acts on the sensations to create perception and conceptions. For Locke, the activity of mind is paramount, as for Bacon, and it is only through the activity of mind (consciousness) that the outer world can be ‘realized’ as causative and as actual. Identity for Locke lay in the capacity for the ‘I’ (consciousness) to unite disparate ‘deeds’ or actions of nature (as cognized by the mind), into a meaningful unity. For Locke, identity of self exists in nothing other than participation in life (the etheric) by means of fluctuating particles of matter rendered meaningful and real by acts of the mind and consciousness. The Romantics, as Locke, refused to accept the view that life is a product of “the chance whirlings of unproductive particles” (Coleridge).\n\nLocke's ideas were taken up by Johann Fichte in Germany and developed into a philosophy of nature and natural science based on mind and consciousness, which he termed \"Wissenschaftslehre\". Fichte, as so many of that time, was also inspired to challenge Kant's views on human freedom (constraints by material forces) and the limits to cognition, and sought this in Locke's emphasis on the mind and consciousness as the pivotal actor and creator of reality. For Fichte, selfhood (\"Ichheit\") is an act not a thing or a substance, and being or identity consists in the acts of mind and self-consciousness, such that being and identity are co-operant. Fichte's work heavily influenced German philosophy and science, leading to a general system of thought known as German Idealism (including Schelling and Hegel), though this idealism would either end paradoxically in accepting the methods of material science for natural science (\"Naturphilosophie\" – Schelling), or in academic and lifeless dialectics (Hegel) that negate life rather than support it and used for political ends (Marxism).\n\nPrior to Fichte's writings, the idea of life as a power and principle independent of and not reducible to matter or substance had been put forward in England and Scotland in the mid-1700s, by the philosopher, Thomas Reid and John Hunter (surgeon), a highly influential anatomist and surgeon as well as an observational scientist in the true Baconian tradition. Hunter rested the idea of the life principle on solid observation of nature. For him, anatomy and structure, matter and form were simply outer expressions of a vital dynamics.\n\nThis idea found a receptive soil in German philosophy and eclectic medicine, as represented by Christoph Hufeland (1762–1836), which had developed the concept of a life force or energy (\"Lebenskraft\") as well, but one that had remained largely speculative or metaphorical. In 1781, Johan Friedrich Blumenbach, a natural philosopher and researcher published his thoughts regarding the \"Bildungstrieb\", a dynamic power that was evolutive, progressive, and creative. Blumenbach's work provided for the later important distinction (by Samuel Hahnemann) between a sustaining power (\"homeostasis\") and a generative power (\"Erzeugungskraft\"), not just for procreation in all its myriad forms, but also creative acts of the mind, which Coleridge said involved the imagination (as opposed to fancy), both primary (unconscious figuration) involving perception, and secondary, the latter leading to apperceptive concepts as a result of conscious acts of the mind (ideas applied to perceptions).\n\nAll of this set up a climate for ideas and concepts that went beyond the mechanistic method of inertial science, one that allowed a role for creative actions of the mind (works of art) as well as reactions to sensations involving objects. Equally, the climate was conducive to considering a dynamic between subject (self and mind/consciousness) and object, one in which the mind is both receptive and pro-active, and also one in which the mind is critical to determining the meaning and reality of any given stimulation from the world outside.\n\nBy the end of the 1700s, medicine, not only in Germany, but throughout Europe, was in a deep crisis. This widely acknowledged crisis was brought into stark relief in 1795 in a famous critical essay by a German physician and philosopher, (1766–1827), in the ‘shot’ that was heard around the medical world. \"Erhard's attack focused on what he called the \"uncertainty\" of medical knowledge and its failure to measure up to the criteria of a philosophical \"Wissenschaft\". He located the central problem in doctors' lack of a clear idea either of illness in general or of particular diseases.\"\n\nJohann B. Erhard’s essay, coupled with the earlier introduction of the Brunonian system into German medical circles, almost immediately triggered a remarkable surge of writings by a graduating medical student, Andreas Röschlaub. Röschlaub wrote his doctoral dissertation on the work of a rather obscure and then little known Scottish physician, John Brown, \"Elementa Medicinae\". Almost at the same time, in 1796, a German physician., Samuel Friedrich Hahnemann, who had been highly critical of the medical practices of his day, published a remarkable essay on the treatment of disease that became the foundation for the homeopathic approach to medicine, as part of a more comprehensive scientific approach for therapeutics he termed Heilkunde, and then later Heilkunst. (Lesser Writings, p. 251)\n\nWhile Brown’s work had been available in Germany for almost 15 years, since its publication in 1780, it had been mostly ignored or rejected, as in England itself, because the method outlined by Brown was seen as a mechanical approach, which hardly endeared it to the German philosophical tradition and mindset seeking a more dynamic, vital approach. However, Röschlaub grasped, where no one else had been able, even Schelling with his \"Naturphilosophie\", that Brown had provided the very elements of an approach to health and sickness that were dynamic in nature and by means of a synthetic concept – ‘excitation’ – that was the practical application of a Lockean and Fichtean approach to the problem of cognition due to subject/object or observer/observed, to the problem of the relationship between qualitative and quantitative, and also to the very problem of life itself. \"Brunonian doctrine therefore fulfilled Erhard's call for a medical practice based on the \"real\" causes of disease rather than on divination of the meaning of symptoms. ... where Erhard had offered only criticism, Brunonianism offered an alternative. Brunonianism now stood ready to complete what Erhard had begun, and to inaugurate a revolution in German medicine.\"\n\nThrough Röschlaub’s writings, mainly between 1795 and 1806, Brown’s conception of life was brought out: as a potential in us that is brought into action and reality as a result of the workings of the actual (excitants or stimulants) on us, and of the living principle as a receptive potentiality (‘excitability’, or the capacity to be impinged upon) and pro-active (‘excitement’, or the capacity to respond to impingements), that is, as a dynamic power.\n\nBrown's use in the original Latin of ‘incitability’ (rather than the more restricted term used in the English – ‘excitability) contained the germ of a distinction between the sustentive (Lebenskraft) and generative (Bildungstrieb) powers, as Coleridge astutely noted: “Brown has not proved that the Incitability itself cannot be altered – not merely thro’ incitement – but unmittlebar [unmediated]– Says the Jena recensent, Feb. 1799, No. 48 (Notebooks 1:38). He might have been thinking of Brown's discussion of contagious diseases wherein we see this interplay between the general action (‘affection’) of the sustentive power (excitability/excitement) and the more specific and different action of ‘contagions’ (e.g., LXXVI: “Contagious diseases are] not an exception...because...no general affection follows the application of contagion, if no undue excess or defect of excitement is the consequence...\"), or his reference to a pro-creative as well as sustaining power as in CCCXXVI (“every living system lives in that which it procreates…that the system of nature remains and maintains an eternal vigour”).\n\nWhen added to his distinction between beneficial (‘agreeable’) and harmful (malignities) ‘excitants’, Brown provided the basis for understanding how the level of excitability/incitability (potential) can be shifted upwards (potentiated). Finally, Brown introduced the powerful idea that pathology (unhealthy function) was simply physiology (healthy function) extended beyond a certain range of sustainable variability or pulsation (a function of the polarities that constitute life).\n\nRöschlaub worked initially with Fichtean insights and then Schelling and his \"Naturphilosophie\", establishing a dynamic philosophical basis in natural science for medicine. However, he realized that medicine could not be restricted to natural science, even a dynamic science grounded in physiology (the germ of which was provided by Dr. in England in 1798, \"A New System of Physiology\"<ref name=Saumarez group=http://www.bookdepository.com/New-System-Physiology-Comprehending-Laws-by-Which-Animated-Beings-General-Human-Species-Particular-Are-Governed-Their-Several-States-Health-Disease-Second-Edition-Two-Volumes-1-2-Richard-Saumarez/9781171030492?b=-3&t=-26#Bibliographicdata-26></ref>), but had an artistic/aesthetic side. In this regard, he made a distinction first between \"Wissenschaftslehre\" (natural science) and \"Heilkunde\" (the practical, clinical side of therapeutics), in which latter work he established the first teaching clinic, in concert with Dr. Markus, in Bamberg, Germany.\n\nRöschlaub made a further distinction between biophysical (\"Heilkunde\") and biomedical (\"Heilkunst\"). The second took him into the very dimension of life itself, the etheric, that is, beyond the physical, a dimension that required an entirely different organ of knowledge from the intellect or \"Sinn\" (\"mens\") that was the foundation of both \"WissenschaftsHeillehre\" and \"Heilkunde\", as the construction of a protocol entails \"arte\". Unbeknownst to him, one of his countrymen had been working on the development and understanding of this new cognitive capacity, called the \"Gemüt\". As a result, Goethe was able to ‘see’ (\"anschauende Erkenntnis\") into the dynamic realm of nature (\"natura naturans\") and comprehend the very movement behind the forms, and the very functions that determined a given form, including the dynamic archetype (\"Kraftwesen\") out of which all forms of a given Idea (such as ‘plant’ or ‘animal’) emanated. It was Goethe who founded the science of morphology. Although Goethe termed this study \"Metamorphosenlehre\", it was, more accurately stated, a pleomorphic process.\n\nThis new cognitive capacity is what was needed for the physician or \"Leibarts\" to go beyond the inner symptomatics and outer semiotics of a case as a basis for assessment and evaluation used by the Old School, and to avoid the pitfalls of the merely empirical approach. It was the task of the physician to draw out (‘educe’), and allow ‘to come forth’ (Heidegger's \"Veranlassung\" and \"Hervorbringung\"), the natural state of health of the individual so as to enable him to undertake his individualized higher purpose in life.\n\"Heilkunst\" was not simply another projective art form such as painting, music, sculpture or poetry, but an educative art, in which the artist, the \"Heilkünstler\" (Hahnemann), seeks to bring forth out of the tangle of illness and disease at all levels, the true physiological selfhood, the fully liberated (at liberty to follow his higher purpose or aspiration) and conscious (a super-conscious mind higher than ordinary or waking consciousness) man or mensch.\n\nRöschlaub also realized that Brown had only provided the basic ‘elements’ of a method for the science of life, and that what was still needed was the overarching or archetypal function from which all other functions were derivable and given meaning and direction, and which would also then provide the very goal and purpose of medicine and health, the ‘positive’ as well as the ‘negative’ (removal of suffering) sides of healthcare. However, this overarching, archetypal function would have to wait until the 20th century for its discovery and elucidation by Dr. Wilhelm Reich (Super-imposition or \"Überlagerung\") and Rudolf Steiner's Metamorphosis, the exponents of the underlying \"Kraftwesen\".\n\nAt the same time that Röschlaub embarked on his quest for a true science of life and health, a compatriot, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, who had quit his medical practice earlier in protest against the lack of science and efficacy of the Old School and the empty ‘metaschematisms’ of the academic ‘doctors’, had also begun a similar quest for a true system of medicine. Hahnemann's essay of 1796 and subsequent writings, all part of an extended \"Organon der Heilkunst\", laid down the basic foundation for a distinction between the sustentive (\"Lebenserhaltungskraft\") [Aphorism 63, 205 fn., 262) and generative (\"Erzeugungskraft\") [Aphorism 21-22] sides of the living principle, between physic, operating under the natural healing law of opposites (\"contraria contrarius\"), and medicine proper, operating under the natural curative law of similars (similia similibus), and between disease, a dynamica impingement on the generative power (degeneration), a derangement of the sustentive power, or disturbance of \"homeostasis\".\n\nHahnemann further established various principles for the application of the law of similars, including a crucial distinction between diseases of a fixed nature (tonic diseases), and those of a variable nature, the basis for the later discovery by some of his followers of a dual remedy prescribing, each remedy addressing one ‘side’ of disease, the tonic and pathic sides. Hahnemann set out a comprehensive approach to the diagnosis and treatment of disease, including a nosology.\n\nHahnemann argued, logically, that the material effects of disease could not be their own cause (\"causa morbii\"). Disease was instead a dynamic affection of the generative power occasioned by a spirit-like morbid entity (Krankheitswesen) [Aphorisms 22, 28] that had the power to impinge upon the generative power of a human (Menschenkraftwesen) [Aphorism 289 fn.], acting as malignant ‘excitants’ in the Brunonian sense. However, this power depended on a susceptibility or receptivity (negative resonance) caused by weakening of the life force from various malignities (Brown's underlying diathesis).\n\nThe disease process consists of a dual action: the initial action (\"Eerstwirkung\") [Aphorisms 70,62,64,65] of the disease agent, which impinges upon the generative power, which is generally imperceptible (such as the initial infection by the measles microbe), and the counter or after-action (\"Gegenwirkung\" [Aph. 63,112, 115], \"Nachwirkung\") [Aph. 62,70, 71] of the sustentive power, which produces the various sufferings the patient complains about.\n\nWhile the fixed nature of tonic diseases could be identified by \"discerning\" the underlying causal state of mind, along with a curative medicine based on fixed principles, the variable or pathic diseases could only be identified, along with their curative medicine, through the symptoms (suffering or \"pathos\") produced by the disease in the patient. However, such an approach was problematic as a person could have more than one disease at a time (Aph. 40-44). This then required a principle to organize the symptoms into an identifiable \"complex\" (\"Inbegriff\") correspondent to a given disease state. Just as each tonic disease has a unique state of mind disturbance, so does each pathic disease contain a unique disturbance of the thermal organization in man. This approach to pathic diseases Hahnemann termed \"homeopathy\" (from the Greek \"homoios\" and \"pathos\", or similar suffering). This approach expanded empiricism from its limitation within the bounds of \"Erfahrung\" (experience of outer forms or \"natura naturata\") to \"Erlebnis\" provings (experience via the life body of \"natura naturans\").\n\nThe tonic diseases were to be found in various jurisdictions: homotoxic (toxins), homogenic (physical and emotional traumas), pathogenic, iatrogenic and ideogenic (spiritual diseases engendered by false belief, which he termed the \"highest diseases\" - as compared to the ‘deepest’ pathic diseases). The pathic diseases are found in reversible layers (‘layers prescribing’).\n\nBecause the pathic diseases generally arise out of the more primary constant (tonic) diseases, such as the chronic diseases that arise out of the chronic miasms, Hahnemann also laid down the principle that the tonic diseases should be treated first, and second any remaining pathic diseases.\n\nWhile the curative medicines for the tonic diseases could be largely determined by the principle linking disease and medicinal agent for the relevant jurisdiction, pathic disease treatment required a corresponding image of derangement of the \"Lebenskraft\" or \"Leib\" (executive organ of the \"Kraftwesen\") so that this could be matched to the image presented by the patient. The problem lay in that a patient could present with more than one disease, each with a particular grouping of symptoms, but how could the practitioner link which symptoms manifest disorder(s) and of those ascribable to disease, and to which disease of the several possible at a given time in the patient, and finally, how could one trace any symptoms so identified to their origins? Here Hahnemann's genius adduced a living experience (\"Erlebnis\") of the essence of a natural substance (\"Naturwesen\") by way of a human prover, and in doing so, also provided the very practical scientific basis for removing the barrier set up by Kantian intellect between observer and observed, by invoking the cognitive capacity of Goethe's \"Gemüt\" (Aphorism 253 of the \"Organon der Heilkunst\"). Goethe himself, later in his life, recognized that Hahnemann had found a way to apply to and through human nature what he was doing with Mother Nature.\n\nIn the light of difficulties treating more complex cases, Hahnemann undertook further research and developed a theory of chronic miasms, which are fixed nature diseases of the pathogenic type (originally infectious, but also inherited) which give rise to all the (secondary) chronic diseases, which are pathic in nature (cf. Röschlaub's \"Pathogenesis\"). Hahnemann also gave indications as to when the practitioner could tell that the disease had been cured by the similar medicine and healing was underway (the complete process termed \"heilen\" or remediation). Constantine Hering, often called the Father of Homeopathy in the US, further developed these guidelines, which are often referred to as \"Hering's Law or Principles\" :\n\nThis was later expanded in the latter half of the 19th century by Dr. James Tyler Kent who noticed that when disease was suppressed or several groups of symptoms (diseases) developed in a patient over time, that the remedial process proceeded in the reverse order of their emergence. This provides the basis for a sequential treatment of diseases. If some symptoms become worse some time after the similar medicine or there is even a return of old symptoms, essentially in chronic, complex cases, this Hahnemann identified as part of the healing process, which involves the counteraction of the sustentive power of the \"Kraftwesen\" against the medicine (similar ‘disease’).[Aph. 63-64]\n\nWhile medicine had historically recognized, even into Hahnemann's time, the law of similars (similia similibus), it was also wary of its use because of risk of harm with the improper dose, and had largely abandoned it in favor of the other approach set out by Hippocrates involving the law of opposites, that is, acting to support the \"physis\" or sustentive power. Dr. Hahnemann discovered a way to attenuate the dose so that it could be rendered harmless but remain therapeutically active, what is often referred to as ‘dynamization’. Later he also discovered a way in which to sublimate, or the increase in dynamic power, of medicines (cf. Brown's sthenic enhancement).\n\nBecause of the use of these two laws, we have two great realms of therapeutics: medicine proper, (medic-al) which is the application of the law of similars, and physic-al, which is the application of the law of opposites. This gives us the mutually interactive and supportive jusrisdictions of the true \"Heilkundiger\" and \"Heilkünstler\" – physician and medician, involving respectively a \"physic\" approach based on the law of opposites and a \"medic\" approach based on the law of similars.\n\nDr. Brown provided the essential elements for a new, functional (actions of powers, forces and energies) approach to understanding life and health, which insights were elaborated by Drs. Röschlaub and Hahnemann. Through their work, a fundamental set of dynamic polarities emerged with which to understand the essential polaric nature of life itself:\n\nAt the same time, Goethe's scientific work on the underlying living functions in nature and Dr. Saumarez's new physiology of functions provided the necessary basis for understanding health and life. Underneath it all lay the elements of the Brunonian system, with its dynamic interplay of impression and response, positive or negative in terms of health (physiology) and divergences therefrom (pathology).\n\nGoethe's approach to Mother Nature provided the theoretical foundation for and found a practical application in human nature in the works of Samuel Hahnemann. Goethe was aware of Hahnemann and his new approach to disease, and was treated using Hahnemann's system of medicine, \"Heilkunst\". On one occasion Goethe wrote:\n\nIn his famous play, Faust, Goethe has the lead character, Mephistopheles, assert the homeopathic principle of similars: “To like things like, whatever one may ail; there’s certain help.”\n\nGoethe wrote several letters in 1820 mentioning and supporting ‘Hahnemann’s method’, ‘Hahnemann’s terminology’, and declaring his ‘confession of faith of a Hahnemannian disciple’, and indicating that he had read his works and looked forward to reflecting on ‘the wonder physician’.\n\nGoethe was also aware of and followed Hahnemann's dietary rules. In 1826, he wrote to the Grand Duke Karl August that his diet was ‘almost Hahnemannian in its strictness’.\n\nHahnemann grasped and worked directly with Goethe's key contribution to Romantic epistemology, the \"Gemüt\", or emotional mind and resonance organ, as well as its polarity to the \"Geist\" or spiritual mind, the directive organ: \"Geistes oder Gemüths Zustandes des Kranken\"; \"Geistes- oder Gemüths-Krankheiten\"; \"gemüthlicher und geistiger Charakter\"; \"Gemüthsart\"; \"Gemüths- und Denkungs- Art\"; \"Geistes- und Gemüths-Organe\", \"Gemüths-Verstimmung\".\n\nHahnemann undertook in the human realm what Goethe had explored in the plant realm with his morphology, that 'adventure of reason' Kant had stated was not possible, and observed first hand, through a living experience (\"Erlebnis\") the impact of a natural \"Wesen\" (dynamic, living essential power) on a human \"Wesen\" (initially himself, and later other volunteers), producing a systematic image of the disturbance it produced in terms of pathology (alterations in feelings, functions and sensations) and semiology (outwardly perceptible signs), both over time in the one person, and then over time in a number of people giving an image (\"Bild\") of the disturbance through its various expressions and manifestations, a Goethean approach.\nIndeed, the entire series and progression of provings or living experiences of medicinal substances by overtly healthy people constitutes an example of what Goethe was promoting as true scientific research:\n\nIn his approach to disease diagnoses and treatment, Hahnemann avoided what Goethe considered the ‘greatest failure’ (\"Unheil\") and fault of material science, namely the separation of experimenter from nature, producing abstract hypotheses (notions) and artificial (\"künstlich\") approaches/treatments based on an accumulation of disparate facts, rather than seeing nature as a complex web of associations, and understanding, as did Hahnemann and Goethe that \"scientific knowledge emerges out of relationships and historical contexts.\"\n\nHahemann also sought to understand disease in its historical progression, as in the case of his \"Wesensgeschichte\" of Psora, the archetype (tonic) of inherited chronic disease, as well as its pleomorphic unfolding via numerous (gradated) levels of secondary (pathic) diseases, which then required a sequential (scalar) approach to treatment. Goethe's morphological insights provide the theoretical basis for Hahnemann's empirical discoveries and living experiments ('provings' or \"Erlbenisse\"). In these provings, Hahnemann sought to contemplate the movement, the flow and transformation of a disease state (\"Gestalt\"), not just an abstract image. Hahnemann also had a Goethean understanding of the sequential nature or unfolding of a disease phenomenon.\n\nIn Hahnemann's distinction between the two sides of the \"Lebenskraft\" – the sustentive or \"Erhaltungskraft\" and the generative or \"Erzeugungskraft\" (\"Bildungstrieb\"), we find the polar logic identified in Goethe's \"Chromatology\" – ‘the sufferings and deeds of light’ via a turbid medium, in the struggle between light energy (\"Licht\") and the now identified 'dark' energy (\"Finsternis\"). We also find this polarity, as well as Goethe's distinction between the spectrum of dark and of light, in the distinction Hahnemann made between primary or tonic disease (based on a super-sensible knowing of psychic states involving alterations in circumstances, occurrents and behaviors via the Goethean \"Gemüt\" or super-sensible cognitive organ) and secondary or pathic disease (based on the sensible manifestation of life energy at the somatic level in terms of feelings, functions and sensations, as well as signs). For Goethe the turbid medium is the atmosphere (airy realm), for Hahnemann it is the living organism (fluid or etheric realm). Goethe's interplay of \"Licht\" and \"Finsternis\" can also be seen in Hahnemann's polarity between \"Geist\" (Spirit) and \"Wesen\" (Dynamis).\n\nThe objections that Goethe leveled against the taxonomy of Linnaeus in botany can be found in the medical sphere in Hahnemann's criticism of the blindly empirical or abstractly intellectual nosology of his time that took a few outer elements, arbitrarily conflated them, then confounded similarity of appearance here with identity of cause and origin. Hahnemann's criticism also was based on an historical study of the morphology of this medical state of mind or \"Kurwesen\", much as Goethe considered the study of history of a phenomenon as a form of knowledge (as did the Greeks).\nEqually, Hahnemann was critical of a static approach to disease nosology, which was constantly shape-shifting as the interaction between \"Krankheitwesen\" and \"Menschenwesen\" expressed different aspects of the same underlying disease (these being considered different diseases in the static Linnean nosology of materialistic medicine). Hahnemann also understood that there was an element of fixity and variability to disease (found in his distinction (1796) between primary (tonic) and secondary (pathic) diseases, just as Goethe accepted a degree of form and structure at the physical level whilst pointing to the underlying dynamics leading to new forms over time (Darwin's adaptation).\n\nThe works of Hahnemann and Röschlaub were continued and furthered by Drs. Arthur Lutze and Johan Schönlein (1793–1864) respectively. Lutze (1813–1870) took the foundations of Hahnemann's approach to disease and placed it on a solid romantic footing in consciously and consistently applying dual remedy prescribing (tonic and pathic disease associations in a given patient).\n\nWhere Hahnemann had hesitated and eventually withdrew his public support in the 5th edition of his \"Organon der Heilkunst\" for dual remedy prescribing, having been unable yet to establish a principle upon which to ground it rationally (what is known as the ‘dual remedy affair’), Lutze later re-issued the 5th edition with the withdrawn dual remedy section and clinically practiced based on such an approach. His contribution is recognized in the monument to both Hahnemann and Lutze in Köthen, Germany.\n\nRöschlaub's innovative work in establishing a teaching clinic based on the Brunonian system, in conjunction with Dr. Albert Marcus, was developed further by J. L. Schönlein (1793–1864), who is recognized explicitly even in allopathic historiography for having established the scientific foundation for the modern teaching and practice clinic. This foundation is one based on natural science, but also on the \"arte\" (Pascal's \"spirit of finesse\") of the practitioner, which is something objective and reproducible though based on a different logic and involving more fugitive causes (allopathic ‘medicine’ accepting only the first and then only natural inertial science, not a true physiology of functions, both physical and etheric)\n\nUp until the middle of the 19th century, following the pioneering work of Brown, Hahnemann, Röschlaub, Lutze and Schönlein, to mention only the main figures, the scientific approach to the question of life, particularly as reflected in the development of Healthcare, seemed conducive to the development of a method that was based on a cognitive capacity going beyond mere mentation (\"Sinn\" or \"mens\") and a true physiology involving living functions rather than simply mechanics and chemistry. However, it seemed that the Zeitgeist (Spirit of the Times) could not yet accept such an approach, most minds being still fully ensconced in the intellectual phase (Coleridge's \"epoch of the intellect and the senses\") of human consciousness. It was only the extraordinary mind of genius that was able at this stage to meet the challenge of a true science of life and mind, what Colerdige termed the “Dynamic System of Thought.”\n\nAs a result, the analytical approach favored by the French, schooled in the Cartesian system of mind-body duality, and with their significant advances in surgery (albeit based on access to and development of original Greek medical writings and more modern Greek surgical practice), came to dominate Western science. In Germany, the work of Rudolf Virchow, while drawing from the advances made by Romantic science, effectively reduced and simplified them more in line with what the intellect was able to grasp. The achievements of Romantic Science and Medicine could not be denied, but neither could they be accepted; instead, the followers of the Romantic tradition were either denigrated as considered misguided, occult, and ultimately dreamers rather than serious scientists. The following historiographic assessment is the one that has generally prevailed until recently.\n\nVirchow's cellular theory provided the supposed basis for life, without explaining it, and superseded the ancient, and by now denigrated humoral theory (because the noetic capacity to diagnose at this etheric level had waned). As such, chemistry and physics could become the basis for medicine, all the more in that medicine effectively had been reduced to surgery and chemistry, the latter due to Pasteur's ‘germ theory’ of disease (really an unproven hypothesis and where proven according to strict requirements of Koch's postulates, still not fully explanatory in terms of the concepts and reality of ‘susceptibility’ and ‘immunity’, which contemporaries of Pasteur, such as Béchamp and Claude Bernard, sought to address).\n\nThe problem of life was to be ‘solved’ by Virchow's cellular hypothesis as the basis of life, which conveniently posited life within medicine without having to explain it.\nThus, as N. Tsouyopoulos points out, Western ‘medicine’ was effectively reduced to surgery and emergency drug treatments, possessing no basis to deal with chronic, complex disorders or diseases having rejected the dynamic approaches developed by the Brunonian orientation, as developed in general terms (physic and physiology) by Röschlaub/Schönlein and Saumarez, and in particular regarding disease (medicine and pathology) by Hahnemann/Lutze. As one reviewer of Tsouyopoulos' major work on romantic medicine summarized: \"Romantic medicine was to fall into disfavour as the positivist approach from France gained ground, to the point where Karl August Wunderlich in 1859 dismissed it as mere hollow theory divorced from all empiricism, a myth that survived for nearly a century.\"\n\nTo the extent that human physiology contains a physical/chemical aspect (broken bones, impinging tumours on vital nerves, severed arteries, or severe tissue damage, significant hormonal or chemical imbalances, severe microbial invasion, and the like), a mechanic-material approach will produce effective results, witness the ‘miracles’ of Western emergency medicine, but in the realm of internal ‘medicine’, there are no cures, only the suppression of symptoms or long-term disease and disorder management using chemical means, mostly synthetic, the intellect seeing no difference between a natural ‘chemical’ and a synthesized one. As one writer summarizes: \"Alongside of English and French medicine of that time, whose significance was never under-appreciated, German Romantic Medicine comes off in no way as inferior or reactionary. Its contribution to overcoming the foundational crisis in medical history and for founding a scientific clinic is substantial and decisive for the whole of later developments...today, in our searching for new models and alternatives in medicine, Romantic Medicine lies closer to home than the so-called natural\nscientific medicine of the later 1800s and early 1900s.\"\n\nIn 2017, Kamiar-K. Rueckert introduced the term \"Romantic Patient\" in reference to Romantic medicine and romantic relationships to describe a patient group, which uses the defence mechanism of splitting to divide medicine into good spiritual alternative medicine and bad scientific-based medicine. In his view, these patients are on the one hand aware of their longing for an intuitively understood healing relationship, while on the other hand deny their underlying reason for this longing.\n"}
{"id": "6724509", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6724509", "title": "Russian cursive", "text": "Russian cursive\n\nRussian cursive is a printed variant of the Russian cursive (when it is reproduced in ABC books and other places) and is typically referred to as , \"(Russian) handwritten font\". It is the handwritten form of the modern Russian Cyrillic script, used instead of the block letters seen in printed material. In addition, Russian italics for lowercase letters are often based on Russian cursive (such as lowercase , which resembles Latin \"m\"). Most handwritten Russian, especially in personal letters and schoolwork, uses the cursive alphabet. In Russian schools most children are taught from first grade how to write with this script.\n\nThe Russian (and Cyrillic in general) cursive was developed during the 18th centuries on the base of the earlier Cyrillic tachygraphic writing (, \"rapid or running script\", which in turn was the 14th–17th chancery hand of the earlier Cyrillic bookhand scripts (called \"ustav\" and \"poluustav\"). It became the handwritten counterpart of so-called \"civil\" (or Petrine) printed script of books. In order, modern Cyrillic italic typefaces are based (in their lowercase part) mostly on the cursive shape of the letters.\n\nThe resulting cursive bears many similarities with the Latin cursive. For example, the modern Russian cursive letters \"\" may coincide with Latin cursive \"ABDEUKMHOPCYX abgezuonpcmyxr\" (𝒜ℬ𝒟ℰ𝒰𝒦ℳℋ𝒪𝒫𝒞𝒴𝒳 𝒶𝒷ℊℯ𝓏𝓊ℯ𝓃𝓅𝒸𝓂𝓎𝓍𝓇), respectively (despite having completely different sound values in many cases); both upright and italic printed typefaces demonstrate less similarity.\n\nOne must not confuse the historical Russian chancery hand (), the contemporary Russian cursive () and the contemporary Russian stenography. The latter is completely different from the other two, though it is sometimes called like the former.\n\nRussian cursive is much like contemporary English and other Latin cursives. But unlike Latin handwriting, which can range from fully cursive to heavily resembling the printed typefaces and where idiosyncratic mixed systems are most common, it is standard practice to write Russian in Russian cursive almost exclusively.\n\nThere exists some ambiguity from the fact that several lowercase cursive letters consist (entirely or in part) of the element that is identical to the dotless Latin cursive letter \"ı\", the cursive Greek letter ι or a half of the cursive letter \"u\", namely . Therefore, certain combinations of these Russian letters cannot be unambiguously deciphered without knowing the language or without a broader context. For example, in the words , \"magician\" and , \"little house\" the combinations and are written identically. The word , \"(you will) deprive (somebody of)\" written in cursive consists almost exclusively of these elements. There are examples of different words that become absolutely identical in their cursive form, e.g. , \"(I) revenge\" and , \"(to) a face\".\n\nIn some forms of cursive, the distinction between and may become elusive because both are written in the shapes of either \"m\" or \"ɯ\". To alleviate this case of ambiguity, a horizontal bar can be written above the character (like \"m̅\" or rarely \"ɯ̅\") if it is , or below (like \"ɯ̲\" or rarely \"m̲\") if it is . Also, writing in its printed form (the \"T\" shape) rather than its usual \"m\" shape is common.\n\nThe letter may also be written in the shape of ∂.\n\nSeveral letters in Russian cursive are different from the cursive used in the Serbian and Macedonian languages. Thus, Serbian/Macedonian cursive lowercase г looks same as in Russian with additional macron, п is written like the cursive Latin \"u\" with macron (\"ū\"), and the letter т is written in the shape of \"ɯ̅\".\n\n"}

Hinton) is an American author who is best known for writing young adult fiction. \"The Outsiders\" was Hinton's first published book in 1967; Hinton wrote the book at the age of seventeen. Hinton based the characters, the Greasers and the Socs, off of teenage gangs and alienated youth in her hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma during the 1960s. \"The Outsiders\" has sold over fourteen million copies since it was published. In 1983, \"The Outsiders\" became a movie, and was later released onto DVD. After experiencing a writer's block and going into a state of depression, Hinton met somebody in her freshmen biology class, who inspired her to continue writing.\n\nHinton followed the advice given to her and wrote her second novel, \"That Was Then, This Is Now\" in 1971. Following that, she wrote her shortest novel, \"Rumble Fish\"; it was published in 1975 after she had published a short story version in a 1968 edition of University of Tulsa's \"Alumni Magazine\". Four years later in 1979, \"Tex\" was published and would be Hinton's last book for nine years as she devoted her time to raise her child. Hinton's next novel \"Taming the Star Runner\" was her first book that wasn't written in first-person point of view. Seven years after \"Taming the Star Runner\", Hinton released her first children's book, \"Big David, Little David\", which followed with the release of \"The Puppy Sister\" in 1995. In 2004, \"Hawkes Harbor\", Hinton's first adult novel, was released. Hinton's most recent book, \"Some of Tim's Stories\", was published in 2007 and is Hinton's third children's book. Overall, Hinton has written nine published books.\n\nHinton has won many awards for her books. Hinton has won the \"ALA Best Books for Young Adults Award\" four times; she won the award for \"That Was Then, This Is Now\" (in 1971), \"Rumble Fish\" (in 1975) and for \"Tex\" and \"Taming the Star Runner\" (in 1979). Hinton has also won a \"School Library Journal Best Books of the Year Award\" for \"Rumble Fish\" (in 1975), and \"Tex\" and \"Taming the Star Runner\" (in 1979). In 1979, Hinton received three other awards for both \"Tex\" and \"Taming the Star Runner\". Hinton's first and only award for a children's book is the \"Parent's Choice Silver Honor Book Award,\" which she won for \"The Puppy Sister\".

{"id": "479210", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=479210", "title": "Secret ballot", "text": "Secret ballot\n\nThe secret ballot, also known as Australian ballot, is a voting method in which a voter's choices in an election or a referendum are anonymous, forestalling attempts to influence the voter by intimidation, blackmailing, and potential vote buying. The system is one means of achieving the goal of political privacy.\n\nSecret ballots are used in conjunction with various voting systems. The most basic form of secret ballot utilizes blank pieces of paper, upon which each voter writes his or her choice. Without revealing the votes to anyone, the voter would fold the ballot paper and place it in a sealed box, which is emptied later for counting. An aspect of secret voting is the provision of a voting booth to enable the voter to write on the ballot paper without others being able to see what is being written. Today, printed ballot papers are usually provided, with the names of the candidates or questions and respective check boxes. Provisions are made at the polling place for the voters to record their preferences in secret, and the ballots are designed to eliminate bias and to prevent anyone from linking voter to ballot.\n\nA problem of privacy arises with moves to improve efficiency of voting by the introduction of postal voting and electronic voting. Some countries permit proxy voting, which some argue is inconsistent with voting privacy.\n\nIn ancient Greece, secret ballots were used in several situations, like ostracism, and also to remain hidden from people seeking favors.\n\nIn ancient Rome, the laws regulating elections were collectively known as \"Tabellariae Leges\", the first of which was introduced in 139 BC (\"lex Gabinia tabellaria\").\n\nToday, the practice of casting secret ballots is so commonplace that most voters would not consider that any other method might be used. Other methods which had been used and which are still used in some places and contexts include \"oral votes\" as well as Open ballot systems involving the public display of votes or roll calls. Other public voting methods include raising a hand to indicate a vote, or the use of coloured marbles or cards to indicate a voting choice.\n\nArticle 31 of the Constitution of the Year III of the revolution (1795) states that \"All elections are to be held by secret ballot\". The same goes with the constitution of 1848: voters could hand-write the name of their preferred candidate on their ballot at home (the only condition was to write on white paper) or receive one distributed on the street. The ballot was folded in order to prevent other people from reading its contents.\n\nLouis-Napoléon Bonaparte attempted to abolish the secret ballot for the 1851 plebiscite with an electoral decree requesting electors to write down \"yes\" or \"no\" (in French: \"oui\" or \"non\") under the eyes of everyone. But he faced strong opposition and finally changed his mind, allowing secret ballot to take place.\n\nAccording to the official web site of the \"Assemblée nationale\" (the lower house of the French parliament), the voting booth was permanently adopted only in 1913.\n\nThe demand for a secret ballot was one of the six points of Chartism.\nThe British parliament of the time refused even to consider the Chartist demands, but it is notable that Lord Macaulay, in his speech of 1842, while rejecting Chartism's six points as a whole, admitted that the secret ballot was one of the two points he could support.\n\nThe London School Board election of 1870 was the first large-scale election by secret ballot in Britain.\n\nAfter several failed attempts (several of them spearheaded by George Grote), the secret ballot was eventually extended generally in the Ballot Act 1872, substantially reducing the cost of campaigning (as treating was no longer realistically possible) and was first used on 15 August 1872 to re-elect Hugh Childers as MP for Pontefract in a ministerial by-election following his appointment as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The original ballot box, sealed in wax with a liquorice stamp, is held at Pontefract museum.\n\nHowever, the use of numbered ballots makes it possible in theory if given access to the relevant documents, to identify which candidate voters voted for. Meaning voting in the UK is not physically secret only in so much as the law says the information should not be accessed.\n\nIn Australia, secret balloting appears to have been first implemented in Tasmania on 7 February 1856.\n\nUntil the original Tasmanian \"Electoral Act 1856\" was \"re-discovered\" recently, credit for the first implementation of the secret ballot often went to Victoria, where it was pioneered by the former mayor of Melbourne, William Nicholson, and simultaneously South Australia. Victoria enacted legislation for secret ballots on 19 March 1856, and South Australian Electoral Commissioner William Boothby generally gets credit for creating the system finally enacted into law in South Australia on 2 April of that same year (a fortnight later). The other Australian colonies followed: New South Wales (1858), Queensland (1859), and Western Australia (1877). New Zealand implemented secret voting in 1870.\n\nState electoral laws, including the secret ballot, applied for the first election of the Australian Parliament in 1901, and the system has continued to be a feature of federal elections and referenda. \nThe Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 does not explicitly set out the secret ballot but a reading of sections 206, 207, 325, 327 of the Act would imply its assumption. Sections 323 and 226(4) do however, apply the principle of a secret ballot to polling staff and would also support the assumption.\n\nBefore 1890, partisan newspapers printed filled-out ballots which party workers distributed on election day so voters could drop them directly into the boxes. All of the states replaced these with secret ballots around 1890, popularly called \"Australian ballots.\" They were printed by the local government and listed all the candidates impartially.\n\nThe \"Australian ballot\" is defined as having four parts:\n\nIn the United States, most states had moved to secret ballots soon after the presidential election of 1884. Kentucky was the last state to do so in 1891, when it quit using an oral ballot. But seven states did not have government-printed ballots until the 20th century; South Carolina created them in 1950\nand Georgia in 1922.\n\nThe first city to start using the Australian ballot in the United States was Louisville, Kentucky, using a ballot drafted by Lewis Naphtali Dembitz, the uncle of and inspiration for future Supreme Court associate justice Louis Brandeis, and the first state to adopt the Australian ballot was Massachusetts. For this reason it is also known as the \"Massachusetts ballot\". In the U.S., voting by secret ballot was universal by 1892 but criminal prohibitions against paying people to vote were only instituted in 1925.\n\nElections in the United States are mostly held by secret ballot, although some states use mail ballots instead, which violate requirements 3 and 4 of the \"Australian ballot\", as it is distributed to the home, and potentially marked in the presence of other people. The states of Colorado, Oregon, and Washington conduct all elections by mailed ballots. The Constitution for the state of West Virginia still allows voters to cast \"open ballots\".\n\nThe right to hold elections by secret ballot is included in\nnumerous treaties and international agreements that obligate their signatory states:\n\nBallot design and polling place architecture often denies the disabled the possibility to cast a vote in secret. In many democracies disabled persons may vote by appointing another person who is allowed to join them in the voting booth and fill the ballot in their name. This does not assure secrecy of the ballot.\n\nThe United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which entered into force in 2008 assures secret ballot for disabled voters. Article 29 of the Convention requires that all Contracting States protect \"the right of the person with disabilities to vote by secret ballot in elections and public referendums\". According to this provision, each Contracting State should provide for voting equipment which would enable disabled voters to vote independently and secretly. Some democracies, e.g. the United States, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Albania or India allow disabled voters to use electronic voting machines. In others, among them Azerbaijan, Canada, Ghana, the United Kingdom, and most African and Asian countries, visually impaired voters can use ballots in Braille or paper ballot templates. Article 29 also requires that Contracting States ensure \"that voting procedures, facilities and materials are appropriate, accessible and easy to understand and use.\" In some democracies, e.g. United Kingdom, Sweden and the United States, all the polling places already are fully accessible for disabled voters.\n\nThe United Kingdom secret ballot arrangements are sometimes criticised because it is possible to link a ballot paper to the voter who cast it. Each ballot paper is individually numbered and each elector also has a number. When an elector is given a ballot paper, their number is noted down on the counterfoil of the ballot paper (which also carries the ballot paper number). This means, of course, that the secrecy of the ballot is not guaranteed, if anyone can gain access to the counterfoils, which are locked away securely before the ballot boxes are opened at the count. Polling station officials colluding with election scrutineers may therefore determine how individual electors have voted.\n\nThis measure is thought to be justified as a security arrangement so that if there was an allegation of fraud, false ballot papers could be identified. The process of matching ballot papers to voters is formally permissible only if an Election Court requires it; in fact the Election Court has never made such an order since the secret ballot was introduced in 1872, although reportedly prisoners in a UK prison were observed identifying voters' ballot votes on a list in 2008. The legal authority for this system is set out in the Parliamentary Elections Rules in Schedule 1 of the Representation of the People Act 1983.\n\nIn the United States, sometimes the number on the ballot is printed on a perforated stub which is torn off and placed on a ring (like a shower curtain ring) before the ballot is cast into the ballot box. The stubs prove that an elector has voted and ensure that they can only vote once, but the ballots themselves are both secret and anonymous. At the end of voting day, the number of ballots inside the box should match the number of stubs on the ring, certifying that every ballot was cast by a registered elector, and that none of them were lost or fabricated. Sometimes the ballots themselves are numbered, making the vote trackable. In 2012, this procedure was ruled legal by Federal District Judge Christine Arguello in Colorado, who determined that the U.S. Constitution does not grant a right to a secret ballot.\n\nSome people believe that the secret ballot enables election fraud and so should be eliminated or supplemented with other ways of verifying voting, such as cryptographically secure receipts.\n\n\n"}

The Project also curates related events, symposia, and exhibitions. The \"Small Axe\" Project is administered by Small Axe Incorporated, a not-for-profit [501(c)3] organization established in New York State in 2002, and is funded by The Ford Foundation, The Reed Foundation, The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, The Wolf Kahn and Emily Mason Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. David Scott, Director; Nijah Cunningham, Coordinator. \nThe aim of the Small Axe Project is to promote the expansion and revision of the scope of Caribbean criticism across multiple platforms. The Project aims to rethink the conceptions that guided the formation of Caribbean modernities; namely, race, class, sovereignty, democracy, development, gender, nation and culture. At the same time, the project is concerned with re-conceptualizing the Caribbean as an object of knowledge and study, across its three major linguistic regions—anglophone, francophone and hispanophone. \nThe current project statement reads:\nDavid Scott is the president of Small Axe Inc., the director of the Small Axe Project, and the founding editor of \"Small Axe\". He teaches in the Department of Anthropology at Columbia University. He is the author of \"Formations of Ritual: Colonial and Anthropological Discourses on the Sinhala Yaktovil\" (1994), \"Refashioning Futures: Criticism After Postcoloniality\" (1999), \"Conscripts of Modernity: The Tragedy of Colonial Enlightenment\" (2004), \"Omens of Adversity: Tragedy, Time, Memory, Justice\" (2014), and \"Stuart Hall’s Voice: Intimations of an Ethics of Receptive Generosity\" (2017). He is also co-editor of \"Powers of the Secular Modern: Talal Asad and his Interlocutors\" (2007), He is currently working on a book project examining the moral imperative of reparations for New World slavery.\n\nDavid Scott was awarded the Council of Editors of Learned Journals (CELJ) Distinguished Editor prize in 2017 for his work as editor of \"Small Axe: A Journal of Caribbean Criticism\".\nGordon Hutner said, at the Book Review Session arranged by CELJ on 5 January 2017:\nSmall Axe: A Caribbean Journal of Criticism is a peer-reviewed triennial print journal that was established in Jamaica in March 1997 as a forum for critical writing. It was originally published by Ian Randle Publishers biannually for the Small Axe Collective. In 1998, the journal moved to University of the West Indies Press. The journal moved again in 2000 to Indiana University Press, and began triennial publication in 2006. \"Small Axe\" has been published by Duke University Press in March, July and November, since 2009. David Scott is Editor and Vanessa Pérez-Rosario is Managing Editor.\n\nThe journal publishes scholarly articles, essays, book discussions, and interviews, as well as literary works of fiction and poetry, visual arts, and reviews. The mission of the journal consists in the renewal of practices of intellectual criticism in the Caribbean, as well as an interrogation and expansion of the idea of \"criticism\". Furthermore, \"Small Axe\" aims to rethink extant conceptualizations of the regional and diasporic Caribbean, and to provide a platform for critical dialogues emerging from and pertaining to the Caribbean. \n\nAccording to \"The Caribbean Review of Books\", \"Small Axe\" has become \"the leading intellectual journal published in the anglophone Caribbean, while maintaining a decidedly critical stance towards the region's political and cultural establishment.\" \n\n\"Small Axe\" celebrated its 50th anniversary issue in 2016.\n\n\"Small Axe\" covers have been designed by graphic artist Juliet Ali since 2006. The covers have been noted for their striking aesthetic. Some covers have aroused controversy. \"Small Axe\" 6 (1999) was considered controversial for its parodying of Edna Manley’s sculpture “Negro Aroused” (1937). In March 2000, \"Small Axe\" 7, guest-edited by Faith Smith, was rejected by the press for being pornographic. This controversy eventually led to the journal’s departure from University of the West Indies Press. \n\nEach cover figures original work from a Caribbean artist. Notable artists featured on the cover of \"Small Axe\" include:\nRas Daniel Heartman (\"Small Axe\" 5, 1999),\nWendy Nanan (\"Small Axe\" 11, 2002),\nLubaina Himid (\"Small Axe\" 23, 2007),\nEdouard Duval Carrie (\"Small Axe\" 27, 2008),\nIngrid Pollard (\"Small Axe\" 28, 2009),\nSandra Brewster (\"Small Axe\" 29, 2009),\nHew Locke (\"Small Axe\" 34, 2011),\nEbony Patterson (\"Small Axe\" 35, 2011),\nArthur Simms (\"Small Axe\" 40, 2013),\nMarlon Griffith (\"Small Axe\" 41, 2013),\nLavar Munroe (\"Small Axe\" 44, 2014),\nNari Ward (\"Small Axe\" 50, 2016), and\nFirelei Báez (\"Small Axe\" 51, 2016).\n\nNotable interviewees featured in the journal include:\nStuart Hall (\"Small Axe\" 1, 1997),\nRichard Hart (\"Small Axe\" 3, 1998),\nKen Post (\"Small Axe\" 4, 1998),\nRobert A.

Notable sections include:\n\nsx salon is a tri-annual digital forum for critical and creative explorations of Caribbean literature. Since its initiation in 2010, \"sx salon\" has aimed to stimulate and engage aesthetic forms across different literary genres that reflect the changing sensibilities of regional and diasporic realities. sx salon publishes literary discussions, interviews, reviews, poetry and prose.

Patterson (Jamaica), Jorge Pineda (Dominican Republic).\n\nA digital platform launched in 2016 that focuses on the digital humanities and its implications for Caribbean scholarship. In the wake of the \"digital turn\" in the humanities, sx archipelagos seeks to promote creative exploration, debate, and critical thinking about and through digital practices in contemporary scholarly and artistic work in and on the Caribbean. \"Sx archipelagos\" engages with scholarly essays; digital scholarship projects; and digital project reviews. Alex Gil and Kaiama L. Glover, Editors.\n\nThe literary competition, launched in 2009, serves as a venue for hearing the voices of emerging Caribbean writers of short fiction and poetry, writing in English, Spanish and French. The competition offers prizes for first and second places in each category. Competition winners are published in \"Small Axe\" the following year. Martin Munro and Vanessa Pérez-Rosario, Coordinators.\n\nIn 2017, the \"Small Axe\" Literary Competition entered a new phase, accepting entries in Spanish, English, and French, on a three-year rotation for submissions in these language.

Part of EC's Picto-Fiction line, each magazine featured three to five stories. The format alternated blocks of text with several illustrations per page.\n\nThe first issue appeared with a cover date of November–December 1955, but the second issue was the last. A third issue existed but was not printed by EC. The Picto-Fiction magazines lost money from the start, and the line was cancelled when EC's distributor went bankrupt.\n\n\"Terror Illustrated\" was edited by Al Feldstein. As with EC's comics, Feldstein was the most prolific writer of the title, and generally wrote up to three stories per issue. In addition to the stories credited to him, Feldstein also wrote under the pseudonyms Maxwell Williams and Alfred E. Neuman. Feldstein included multiple retellings of previous stories, a move suggested by publisher William Gaines. This included \"The Basket\" and \"The Gorilla's Paw\" in the first issue and \"Horror in the Freak Tent\" and \"Reflection of Death\" in #2. Other contributing writers included Jack Oleck (who had worked as a writer on EC's earlier publications) and John Larner.\n\nFeatured illustrators included Reed Crandall, Joe Orlando, George Evans, Graham Ingels, Johnny Craig, Charles Sultan and Jack Davis.\n\nIn 2006 \"Terror Illustrated\" was reprinted along with the other Picto-Fiction magazines by publisher Russ Cochran (with Gemstone Publishing) in hardbound volumes as the final part of his \"Complete EC Library\".

It is similar to \"break a leg\" and reflects a superstition that wishing someone \"good luck\" is in fact bad luck.\n\n\"Toi toi toi\" was an idiom used to ward off a spell or hex, often accompanied by knocking on wood or spitting. The origin is a threefold warning of the devil (Teufel, pr. toi-fell) in German dialect:\n\n\"No’ kommt mer in’s Teu-Teu-Teufelskuchen bey ihm. Now we come into the De-De-Devil's Kitchen!\"\n\nAlso from Rotwelsch \"tof\" and from Yiddish \"tov\" (\"good\", derived from the Hebrew טוב and with phonetic similarities to the Old German \"tiuvel\" \"Devil\").\n\nA separate explanation sees \"toi toi toi\" as the onomatopoeic rendition of spitting three times, a common practice in many parts of the world to ward off evil spirits. Saliva traditionally had demon-banishing powers.\n\nAn alternate operatic good luck charm, originating from Italy, is the phrase \"\" (\"In the mouth of the wolf\") with the response \"Crepi!\" or \"Crepi il lupo!\" (\"May it [the wolf] die!\"). Amongst actors \"Break a leg\" is the usual phrase, while for professional dancers the traditional saying is \"merde\" (from the French \"shit\"). In Spanish, the phrase is \"mucha mierda\", or \"lots of shit\".\n\n"}
{"id": "1954257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1954257", "title": "Ubayd Zakani", "text": "Ubayd Zakani\n\nNizam al-Din Ubaydullah Zakani (), or simply Ubayd-i Zakani ( c. 1300 – 1371 CE), was a Persian poet and satirist of the 14th century (Mongol Period) from the city of Qazvin. He studied in Shiraz under the best masters of his day, but eventually moved back to his native town. He however preferred Shiraz to Qazvin, as he was a court poet in Shiraz for \"Shah Abu Ishaq\", where a young Hafez was present as well.\n\nHis work is noted for its satire and obscene verses, often political or bawdy, and often cited in debates involving homosexual practices. He wrote the \"Resaleh-ye Delgosha\", as well as \"Akhlaq al-Ashraf\" (\"Ethics of the Aristocracy\") and the famous humorous fable \"Masnavi Mush-O-Gorbeh\" (Mouse and Cat), which was a political satire. His non-satirical serious classical verses have also been regarded as very well written, in league with the other great works of Persian literature. He is one of the most remarkable poets, satirists and social critics of Iran (Persia), whose works have not received proper attention in the past. His books are translated into Russian, Danish, Italian, English, and German (by Joachim Wohlleben, 2009: seemingly the first translation of the complete work into a Western language).\n\nWhile pursuing his studies in Shiraz Ubayd became one of the most accomplished men of letters and learning of his time, acquiring complete proficiency in every art, and compiling books and treatises on them. He subsequently returned to Qazvin, where he had the honour of being appointed to a judgeship and was chosen as the tutor and teacher of sundry young gentlemen. At that time the Turks in Persia had left no prohibited or vicious act undone, and the character of the Persian people, by reasons of association and intercourse with them, had become so changed and corrupted that Ubayd Zakani, disgusted at the contemplation thereof, sought by every means to make known and bring home to them the true conditions of affairs. Therefore, as an example of the corrupt morals of the age and its people, he composed the treatise known as \"Akhlaq-i Ashraf\" \"Ethics of the Aristocracy\", which was not intended as mere ribaldry, but as a satire containing serious reflections and wise warnings. So, likewise, in order to depict the level of intelligence and degree of knowledge of the leading men of Qazwin each one of whom was a mass of stupidity and ignorance, he included in his \"Risala-i Dilqusha\" \"Joyous Treatise\" many anecdotes of which each contains a lesson for persons of discernment.\n\nAs a measure of his accomplishments, experience, learning and worldly wisdom, his \"Risala-i-Sad\" \"Tract of a Hundred Counsels\" and his \"Ta'rifat\" \"Definitions\" are a sufficient proof. Moreover, he composed a treatise \"Ilm-i-Ma'ni u Bayan\" \"Rhetoric\" which he desired to present to the king. The courtiers and favorites, however, told him that the King had no need for such rubbish. Then he composed a fine panegyric, which he desired to recite, but they informed him that the king did not like to be mocked with the lies, exaggerations and fulsome flattery of poets. Thereupon 'Ubayd-i-Zakani said, 'In that case I, too, will pursue the path of impudence, so that by these means I may obtain access to the King's most intimate society, and may become one of his courtiers and favorites', which he accordingly did.\n\nThen he began recklessly to utter the most shameless sayings and the most unseemly and extravagant jests, whereby he obtained innumerable gifts and presents, which none dared to pose and contend with him. Thus 'Ubayd-i-Zakani a serious writer, a moralist and a panegyrist was compelled by circumstances to become a ribald satirist.\n\nThe most striking feature of the serious poems of 'Ubayd-i-Zakani is the constant references to Fars and its capital, Shiraz, which evidently held the affection of the poet far more than his native city of Qazvin.\n\nUbayd wrote religious poems, praise of God, Muhammad and the Rashidun caliphs; but he neither claimed nor desired to lead a virtuous life.\n\nPoverty and debt were the usual lots of 'Ubayd.\n\nAmong his works are the Musnavi and Mush o-gorbeh (Mouse and Cat)\nTract of hundred counsels.(short sayings of Wisdom).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) A guy got married. On their first night together, his wife started piercing her ears with a needle. When they had sex a bit later, he found she was not a virgin. He said: \"my lady, the hole you must have created while in your father's house, you're making here, and the one you should make here you've already made there\".\n\n2) A guy from Qazvin was screwing his wife in the summer heat. The woman kept farting every now and then. \"What are you doing?\" he protested. \"Blowing air at your balls so they don't overheat\", she responded.\n\n3) A good-looking Christian boy converted to Islam. The sheriff ordered his circumcision, on the first day, and raped him that very night. The next day his father asked him: \"how did you find Muslims?\" \"Strange peoples\", he responded. \"Whoever accepts their faith, they cut his dick in the day and tear his ass in the night.\" \n\n4) A guy went to a religious scholar and said: \"I get an erection whenever I pray. What should I do?\" The scholar said: \"think of your parents passing\". \"Doesn't work\", he responded. \"Your own last breath\", \"no use\". Whatever the scholar said didn't work. He finally got mad and said: \"so just come fuck me you ass\". The guy responded: \"your holiness's wish is my command\". \n\n5) A guy from Shiraz was making love to his wife. He noticed that she had not removed her pubic hair. He said: \"this is no problem between us as husband and wife, but make sure you're careful about these things with strangers as it would cause huge embarrassment\".\n\n6) A king had three wives: Persian, Arab and Coptic. One night, he was in bed with the Persian wife. \"What time is it?\" he asked. \"It must be dawn\", the wife responded. \"How do you know?\", \"The scent of fresh grass and flowers has risen and the birds are singing\", she responded. The next night he asked the Arab wife the same question. \"It must be dawn as the pearls of my necklace feel cool on my breasts\", she answered. On the third night, he asked the same question to the Coptic wife. \"It must be dawn as I really have to shit\", she said.\n"}
