Access to public information is considered of fundamental importance for the effective functioning of democratic systems, as it enhances governments' and public officials' accountability, boosting people participation and allowing their informed participation into public life. The fundamental premise of the right to access public information is that the information held by governmental institutions is in principle public and may be concealed only on the basis of legitimate reasons which should be detailed in the law. Access to public information builds on the principle that in a democratic system people should be in the condition of accessing a wide range of information in order to effectively participate in public life as well as on matters affecting them.\n\nIn Armenia the right of access to information is guaranteed and defined by the Articles 27 and 27.1 of the Constitution. Also, Armenia has a specific law on freedom of information providing the basic foundations for the realization of this right. According to the Constitution and the Law, in Armenia everybody, in spite of the fact he/she is a citizen of the country or not, has a right to have access to information.\n\nThe Law on Freedom of Information was adopted in September 2003 and was widely considered a progressive document, greatly appreciated by international experts. Since the adoption of the law, civil society and the journalists community, have advocated for the need to pass the regulations that would have supported and improved the implementation of the law. Such regulations were finally adopted in October 2015, when the Armenian government approved a procedure for improving the effectiveness of the procedure to access public information by streamlining the classification, maintenance and provision of information from the government to the public. Prior to the adoption of these regulations, in several cases public officials used to cite the lack of these implementation rules when refusing requests for information.\n\nAccording to the law, people can obtain information from: central government bodies, self-governing bodies, state institutions, organizations financed from central or local government finances, organizations with public functions, i.e. organisations providing public services (for instance, private universities, schools, hospitals, energy provider companies, etc.) Each body has a person that is responsible for freedom of information and is in charge of dealing with information requests.\n\nTo submit a request to access information, applicants have to apply to the information holder with a written or oral inquiry to be addressed to specific departments in the appropriate body or organization. Civil society organizations advocating for access to information suggest to apply with a written inquiry so that a compliant can be done in case of rejection. To be taken into consideration, both written and oral inquiries have to meet the requirements stated by the law.\n\nThe inquirer is not obliged to justify the enquiry and to state the reason for it or how the information sought is going to be used.\n\nIf the body/organizations does not possess all the details concerning the information required, the information holder has to provide the available parts and mention the name and the location of other possible information holders who might be in possess of other details concerning the information sought.\n\nInformation are provided free of charge. Only technical expenses of information provision (photocopies, electronic supports, etc.) can be charged.\n\nFreedom of information can be restricted only on grounds well defined by the law. Information holder may refuse to provide information if it contains state, official, bank or trade secret; infringe the privacy of individuals and his family; contains pre-investigation data which cannot be made public; concerns data with accessibility limitation (such as business, notary or medical secrets); infringes copyright and associated rights.\n\nIn case of rejection, the information holder has to inform the applicant within 5 days in a written form and explain the reasons for the refusal as well as the relevant appealing procedures. Denials can be appealed to the Ombudsman or the court by administrative procedure. Citizens can also apply directly to the concerned bodies without appealing by an administrative procedure. Also, it is possible to apply to non-governmental organizations which provide legal advisory.\n\nIn practice, despite the good legal framework, citizens and media professionals face some problems in accessing documents, such as incomplete disclosure of the information required, extensions of the time frame for obtaining information prescribed by the law, the refusal of some government bodies and officials to implement the law, and so forth. According to the NGO Freedom of Information Center of Armenia and the Transparency International Anticorruption Center, the main challenge is the behaviour of some public officials and public bodies that continue to provide answers that are either irrelevant or incomplete. This has resulted in major difficulties for NGOs being less and less successful in bringing freedom of information cases before the courts than in previous years, as judges rejected their cases on the grounds that public offices had provided the answers, regardless of their content.\n\nIn Armenia, NGOs have played a significant role in educating the public on how to exercise their \"right to know\" and have organised trainings for public officials. By 2012, the NGO Freedom of Information Center Armenia has distributed around 2050 bulletin boards in several urban and rural communities in order to inform the public on the right to access public information and how to realize it.\n\n"}
{"id": "177483", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177483", "title": "Aestheticism", "text": "Aestheticism\n\nAestheticism (also the Aesthetic Movement) is an intellectual and art movement supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values more than social-political themes for literature, fine art, music and other arts. This meant that art from this particular movement focused more on being beautiful rather than having a deeper meaning — \"art for art's sake\". It was particularly prominent in Europe during the 19th century, supported by notable figures such as Walter Pater and Oscar Wilde, but contemporary critics are also associated with the movement, such as Harold Bloom, who has recently argued against projecting social and political ideology onto literary works, which he believes has been a growing problem in humanities departments over the 20th century. \n\nIn the 19th century, it was related to other movements such as symbolism or decadence represented in France, or decadentismo represented in Italy, and may be considered the British version of the same style.\n\nThe British decadent writers were much influenced by the Oxford professor Walter Pater and his essays published during 1867–68, in which he stated that life had to be lived intensely, with an ideal of beauty. His text \"Studies in the History of the Renaissance\" (1873) was very well regarded by art-oriented young men of the late 19th century. Writers of the Decadent movement used the slogan \"Art for Art's Sake\" (\"L'art pour l'art\"), the origin of which is debated. Some claim that it was invented by the philosopher Victor Cousin, although Angela Leighton in the publication \"On Form: Poetry, Aestheticism and the Legacy of a Word\" (2007) notes that the phrase was used by Benjamin Constant as early as 1804. It is generally accepted to have been promoted by Théophile Gautier in France, who interpreted the phrase to suggest that there was not any real association between art and morality.\nThe artists and writers of Aesthetic style tended to profess that the Arts should provide refined sensuous pleasure, rather than convey moral or sentimental messages. As a consequence, they did not accept John Ruskin, Matthew Arnold, and George MacDonald's conception of art as something moral or useful, \"Art for truth's sake\". Instead, they believed that Art did not have any didactic purpose; it only needed to be beautiful. The Aesthetes developed a cult of beauty, which they considered the basic factor of art. Life should copy Art, they asserted. They considered nature as crude and lacking in design when compared to art. The main characteristics of the style were: suggestion rather than statement, sensuality, great use of symbols, and synaesthetic/Ideasthetic effects—that is, correspondence between words, colours and music. Music was used to establish mood.\n\nPredecessors of the Aesthetics included John Keats and Percy Bysshe Shelley, and some of the Pre-Raphaelites who themselves were a legacy of the Romantic spirit. There are a few significant continuities between the Pre-Raphaelite philosophy and that of the Aesthetes: Dedication to the idea of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’; admiration of, and constant striving for, beauty; escapism through visual and literary arts; craftsmanship that is both careful and self-conscious; mutual interest in merging the arts of various media. This final idea is promoted in the poem \"L’Art\" by Théophile Gautier, who compared the poet to the sculptor and painter. Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones are most strongly associated with Aestheticism. However, their approach to Aestheticism did not share the creed of ‘Art for Art’s Sake’ but rather “a spirited reassertion of those principles of colour, beauty, love, and cleanness that the drab, agitated, discouraging world of the mid-nineteenth century needed so much.” This reassertion of beauty in a drab world also connects to Pre-Raphaelite escapism in art and poetry.\n\nIn Britain the best representatives were Oscar Wilde and Algernon Charles Swinburne, both influenced by the French Symbolists, and James McNeill Whistler and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The style and these poets were satirised by Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera \"Patience\" and other works, such as F. C. Burnand's drama \"The Colonel\", and in comic magazines such as \"Punch,\" particularly in works by George Du Maurier.\n\nCompton Mackenzie's novel \"Sinister Street\" makes use of the type as a phase through which the protagonist passes as he is influenced by older, decadent individuals. The novels of Evelyn Waugh, who was a young participant of aesthete society at Oxford, describe the aesthetes mostly satirically, but also as a former participant. Some names associated with this assemblage are Robert Byron, Evelyn Waugh, Harold Acton, Nancy Mitford, A.E. Housman and Anthony Powell.\n\nArtists associated with the Aesthetic style include Simeon Solomon, James McNeill Whistler, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Aubrey Beardsley. Although the work of Edward Burne-Jones was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery which promoted the movement, it also contains narrative and conveys moral or sentimental messages hence it falls outside the given definition.\n\nThe primary element of Decorative Art is utility. The maxim \"art for art's sake\", identifying art or beauty as the primary element in other branches of the Aesthetic Movement, especially fine art, cannot apply in this context. Decorative art must first have utility, but may also be beautiful. Decorative art is dissociated from fine art.\n\nImportant elements of the Aesthetic Movement have been identified as Reform and Eastern Art. The Government Schools of Design were founded from 1837 onwards in order to improve the design of British goods. Following the Great Exhibition of 1851 efforts were intensified and Oriental objects purchased for the schools teaching collections. Owen Jones, architect and Orientalist was requested to set out key principles of design and these became not only the basis of the schools teaching but also the propositions which preface \"The Grammar of Ornament\" (1856), which is still regarded as the finest systematic study or practical sourcebook of historic world ornament.\n\nJones identified the need for a new and modern style that would meet the requirements of the modern world, rather than the continual re-cycling of historic styles, but saw no reason to reject the lessons of the past. Christopher Dresser, a student and later Professor at the school worked with Owen Jones on \"The Grammar of Ornament\", as well as on the 1863 decoration of The Oriental Courts (Chinese, Japanese, and Indian) at the South Kensington Museum, advanced the search for a new style with his two publications \"The Art of Decorative Design\" 1862, and \"Principles of Design\" 1873.\n\nProduction of Aesthetic style furniture was limited to approximately the late 19th century. Aesthetic style furniture is characterized by several common themes:\n\nEbonized furniture means that the wood is painted or stained to a black ebony finish. The furniture is sometimes completely ebony-colored. More often however, there is gilding added to the carved surfaces of the feathers or stylized flowers that adorn the furniture.\n\nAs aesthetic movement decor was similar to the corresponding writing style in that it was about sensuality and nature, nature themes often appear on the furniture. A typical aesthetic feature is the gilded carved flower, or the stylized peacock feather. Colored paintings of birds or flowers are often seen. Non-ebonized aesthetic movement furniture may have realistic-looking three-dimensional-like renditions of birds or flowers carved into the wood.\n\nContrasting with the ebonized-gilt furniture is use of blue and white for porcelain and china. Similar themes of peacock feathers and nature would be used in blue and white tones on dinnerware and other crockery. The blue and white design was also popular on square porcelain tiles. It is reported that Oscar Wilde used aesthetic decorations during his youth. This aspect of the movement was also satirised by \"Punch\" magazine and in \"Patience\".\n\nIn 1882 Oscar Wilde visited Canada, where he toured the town of Woodstock, Ontario and gave a lecture on May 29 titled \"The House Beautiful\". This particular lecture featured the early Aesthetic art movement, also known as the \"Ornamental Aesthetic\" art style, where local flora and fauna were celebrated as beautiful and textured, layered ceilings were popular. An example of this can be seen in Annandale National Historic Site, located in Tillsonburg, Ontario, Canada. The house was built in 1880 and decorated by Mary Ann Tillson, who happened to attend Oscar Wilde's lecture in Woodstock, and was influenced by it. Since the Aesthetic art movement was only prevalent from about 1880 until about 1890, there are not many surviving examples of this particular stylem but one such example is 18 Stafford Terrace, London, which provides an insight into how the middle classes interpreted the principles of Aesthetics.\n\n\n\n"}

Florida Democratic Senator Bob Graham, who chaired the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence at the time the report said in his sworn statements that \"there was evidence of support from the Saudi government for the terrorists.\"\n\nIn 2017 a New York lawyer, Jim Kreindler, said that he had found \"a link between Saudi officials and the hijackers.\"\n\nIn July 2016, the U.S. government released a document, compiled by Dana Lesemann and Michael Jacobson, known as \"File 17\", which contains a list naming three dozen people, including Fahad al-Thumairy, Omar al-Bayoumi, Osama Bassnan, and Mohdhar Abdullah, which connects Saudi Arabia to the hijackers. According to the former Democratic US Senator Bob Graham, “Much of the information upon which File 17 was written was based on what’s in the 28 pages.”\n\nThe Saudi government has long denied any connection. Relatives of victims have tried to use the courts to hold Saudi royals, banks, or charities responsible, but these efforts have been thwarted partly by a 1976 law giving foreign governments immunity. According to Gawdat Bahgat, a professor of political science, following the 11 September attacks the so-called \"Saudi policy of promoting terrorism and funding hatred\" faced strong criticism by several \"influential policy-makers and think-tanks in Washington\".\n\nThe US government has actively collaborated with the Saudis in suppressing the revelation of evidence of the Saudi government's responsibility for the attacks, denying FOIA requests and supplying inside information to the lawyers representing the Saudis involved. Graham characterises the strategy as not a 'cover up' but \"aggressive deception\".\n\nAccording to the New York Post in 2017, Saudi government was accused of performing \"dry run\" by paying two Saudi nationals, al-Qudhaeein and Hamdan al-Shalawi, \"living undercover in the US as students, to fly from Phoenix to Washington,\" two years before the attacks. Based on the FBI documents, Qudhaeein and Shalawi were in fact members of \"the Kingdom's network of agents\" in the United States. The documents also claimed that they were \"trained in Afghanistan with a number of other al-Qaeda operatives that participated in the attacks.\" In November 1999, they boarded an America West flight to Washington, reportedly paid for by the Saudi Embassy. During the flights they tried to access the cockpit several times, in order to \"test out flight deck security before 9/11.\" The pilots made an emergency landing in Ohio since they were \"so spooked by the Saudi passengers and their aggressive behavior.\"\n\nIn March 2016, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir threatened to sell US$750 billion worth of American assets owned by Saudi Arabia if the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) designed to create an exception to the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act was enacted, which caused fears of destabilizing the US dollar. U.S. president Barack Obama also warned against “unintended consequences”, while Saudi economy analysts believed that this action would damage the Saudi government.\n\nThe JASTA was enacted, after Barack Obama's veto was overridden by Congress, on 28 September 2016. Although Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton publicly supported the proposed legislation, Sanders and Tim Kaine, Clinton's running mate, were the only two senators that refrained from voting to override Obama's veto. Senator Harry Reid was the sole \"No\" vote.\n\nIn March 2018, a US judge allowed a suit to move forward against Saudi Arabia brought by 9/11 survivors and victim's families.\n\n"}

Peterson (born 1963) is an American scholar of religious studies who is currently a professor in the Department of Religion at the University of Florida, where she has worked since 1993. Her research variously concerns religion in Latin America and ethics—including religious ethics, Christian ethics, environmental ethics, animal ethics and social ethics. She is the author of five monographs: \"Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion\" (State University of New York Press, 1997); \"Being Human\" (University of California Press, 2001); \"Seeds of the Kingdom\" (Oxford University Press, 2001); \"Everyday Ethics and Social Change\" (Columbia University Press, 2009); and \"Being Animal\" (Columbia University Press, 2013).\n\nPeterson studied at Williams College (1981–1983) before going on to receive a religious studies BA from the University of California at Berkeley (1983–1985). She then studied at the University of Chicago Divinity School from 1986 to 1991. She received an MA in 1987, and a PhD in Ethics and Society in 1991. Her doctoral thesis was supervised by Robin Lovin. She became an assistant professor in religious studies at St. Norbert College in 1991, where she remained until 1993, when she took up the position of assistant professor at the University of Florida Department of Religion. In 1997, her \"Martyrdom and the Politics of Religion\" was published with State University of New York Press. The book blends theology, social history and ethnographic anthropology to explore ideas of Catholic martyrdom in the Salvadoran Civil War. She became an associate professor in 1998, and spent two years as a visiting fellow at the Wesleyan University Department of Religion. 2001 saw the publication of her \"Being Human\", a book about environmental ethics from the perspective of religious ethics. In 2002, she became a full professor.\n\nPeterson has published a number of books while a full professor at Florida. \"Seeds of the Kingdom\", a comparative study of United States Amish farming communities and of El Salvador's refugee communities, appeared in 2005. Both groups examined, Peterson argues, attempt to build utopian Christian communities. \"Everyday Ethics and Social Change\" was published in 2009. In this book, Peterson argues that humans should the extend ethical values dominant in interpersonal relationships, such as love, to differently structure currently instrumental societal and political relationships. 2011 saw the publication of \"Working Toward Sustainability: Ethical Decision-Making in a Technological World\", a textbook which Peterson co-authored with Charles J. Kibert, Martha C. Monroe, Richard R. Plate and Leslie Paul Thiele. In 2013's \"Being Animal\", Peterson critiques the separation of environmental and animal ethics. Though frequently thought irreconcilable, Peterson argues that the separation can be blamed on a weak understanding of nature, humans, and animals, as well as the relationships between them.\n\nIn addition to her books, Peterson has written over twenty articles published in peer reviewed academic journals and scholarly edited collections, as well as various review articles, book reviews and encyclopedia articles.\n\n\n"}

There are hundreds of companies that operate acting, modeling, and dancing audition websites. Originally, only talent agents were able to provide actors, models, dancers and other performers with audition information. This meant that only performers that were represented by Talent Agents could go on auditions. Today, both open auditions and private auditions can be found on reliable audition websites. Talented performers can browse the World Wide Web and find many different audition websites. The primary organization of professional screen and theater casting in the United States is the Casting Society of America (CSA). Membership to the CSA is optional.\n\nAudition websites are an integral component in the employment statistics of actors and other industry professionals. Most acting assignments are typically short term and range from 1 day to a few months. Many professional actors use either agents or managers to find work, and plan their careers. A talent agent generally earns a percentage of the pay earned by an actor, as specified in the actor’s contract. Other actors rely solely on attending open auditions, found on audition websites, for parts.\n\nSome audition websites require membership and others are free to use. Most all audition websites involve the member regularly browsing audition listings and \"self-submitting\" for auditions. This enables members to choose the types of jobs that they audition for. Other than membership dues, audition websites do not charge other fees or take a percentage of income earned from jobs. Audition websites have grown in popularity and the most visited audition websites have memberships in the millions. A casting director, talent agent, film producer, or movie director can use Audition websites to locate performers for casting. These industry professionals use audition websites to find talent for commercials, music videos, movies, and other entertainment projects.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "31627440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31627440", "title": "Biohistory", "text": "Biohistory\n\nBiohistory is a relatively new school of historiography although its development can be found in the late nineteenth century. Biohistory is defined, according to biohistorian Stephen Boyden, as a \"coherent system of knowledge, or field of study, which reflects the broad sequence of happenings in the history of the biosphere and of civilization, from the beginning of life to the present day.\"\nFor the historians who study under this school, one of the main principles is the understanding the relationship of the biosphere, the total collection of Earth’s ecosystems combined and various human elements, including cultural adaptations and the impact of biological forces on society. One of the things that make biohistory unique is that the \"starting point is the history of life on Earth, and the basic principles and facts of evolution, genetic inheritance, ecology, and physiology. Next, it turns to consider the evolutionary background, biology and innate sensitivities of the human species, and the emergence in evolution of the human aptitude for culture.\"\n\nBiohistory emerged from several different schools and disciplines including the Annales school, environmental history, human geography, and sociobiology as well as Darwinian Theory. However, there are biohistorians who work towards eliminating affiliation with Darwinian Theory, especially Social Darwinism, in order to reduce critiques of biological determinism.\n\nA similar concept to biohistory, evolutionary biology is different because it only takes into account the scientific aspects of phenomena and not the historical implications.\nAs of 2010, the American Historical Association (AHA) has not accepted biohistory as a legitimate historiographical school of study, though there are academic scholars who study under it. However, for over one hundred years, there have been statements given that suggest an eventual acceptance of the main tenets of biohistory as a basis for future historical research and scholarship. The term biohistory has contested origins because many scholars who write on the topic claim to have coined it.\n\nThere are scholars within the field of history that say the current study of history does not fully take into account the scope of human history, but “omits the events and effects of the longest period of human existence.” The “longest period” referring to the large quantity of time that humans (Homo Sapiens) spent adapting and evolving to their environment. Robert S. McElvaine (January 24, 1947- ) argues that the study of history should take into account “the evolution of the particular sort of animals we are.” History combined with “evolutionary biology could provide historians with a means of assessing how changes over long periods of prehistory affect the times we study.”\nIn 1991, Carl N. Degler (February 6, 1921- ) noted that, as of that time, social scientists in various fields including sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and political scientists had begun to accept the notion that biology, as it describes innate human proclivities, plays an important role in study, but he could not point to any historian that necessarily accepted this notion. Many of the scholars that have influenced biohistory are scientists by nature. Aside from the above list of professionals, geographers, sociobiologists, microbiologists, pathologists, and others have contributed.\nHuman proclivities or the natural tendencies to behave in a certain manners commonly referred to as human nature, which historians can study, include the ability to adapt into small bands of hunter-gatherers.\nOne of the many benefits of studying biohistory is the increased ability for historians and scientists to conduct “collaborative research projects, which offer the potential for unusual analytical perspectives as well as new evolutionary sources” as stated by Nancy Buenger, an American history scholar.\nSome scholars promote the idea that using biology as a method to history should not only study what features, values, and predispositions of the human condition were favorable in the environment, but also “how those predispositions interacted with the various cultural and historical environments in which humans have lived.” In the study of biohistory, McElvaine states that biology is a useful tool for history and that both can be utilized to gain a broader perspective of history.\n\nBiohistory has its roots in the late nineteenth century with the evolutionary biology theories of Charles Darwin (February 12, 1809 – April 19, 1882). Up until this time, the primary focus of history was to study the lives and events of important people including kings and generals. The topics of biohistory soon began gaining popularity as a study of history. In 1901 the president of the AHA, Charles Francis Adams Jr (May 27, 1835 – May 20, 1915), stated that Darwinian Theory “was the dividing line between us [contemporary historians] and the historians of the old school.”\nThe early movements toward biohistory, however, were not followed and lost momentum due to Franz Boas (July 9, 1859 – December 21, 1942) with his research into the differences between biological and cultural evolution. Another group that led to the decline of biohistorical study was the Frankfurt School, a group of neo-Marxist intellectuals that challenged some widely held societal ideologies.\n\nThe Annales School, which was formed in the years between the world wars, came into opposition to these critiques of biohistorical research. The idea behind the Annales School was to write a total history which utilized various scientific studies such as geography. Fernand Braudel (August 24, 1902 – November 27, 1985), a student of founder Lucien Febvre (July 22, 1878 – September 11, 1956), believed that in the study of history, one must remember to consider “humans as living organisms and to not lose sight of the ‘biological reality of man.”\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, environmental history gained notoriety as a discipline. It did not take long for environmental history to shift towards using biology to explain history. Alfred W. Crosby, a prominent environmental historian once claimed that “[t]he ideology of environmental history is, at its roots, biological.” He is also noted as combining both principles in several of his books including The Colombian Exchange (1972) and Ecological Imperialism (1986). The study of biohistory, although similar to environmental history, is different in the aspect that it takes into account the environment as well as other biological phenomena in the study of history.\nIn 2001, at the 115th annual conference of the AHA, Edward O. Wilson (June 10, 1929- ), the founder of sociobiology, gave a speech at the 115th annual conference of the AHA in 2001. He stated that “[h]istory is no longer just the study of war and peace, of politicians and economics. If the next generation of historians hopes to understand the driving forces of humanity, they need to know the principles of ecology, population genetics and even molecular biology.” Although not fully recognized as a separate discipline, the 115th AHA conference sponsored a distinct session on biohistory which shows that historians are thinking of the implications of biology on history, though many historians remain skeptical because they do not wish biohistory to be labeled “biological determinism.”\n\nOne of the first contributors to what can be deemed biohistory was Ellsworth Huntington (September 16, 1876 – October 17, 1947). Although a geographer by study, Huntington discovered an interesting correlation between the nature of climate, human geography, and culture. In his book, Climate and Civilization published in 1915, he found that there is a positive correlation between the amounts of energy exerted based on climate regions and the perceived areas of civilization. Ellsworth defines civilization as “those characteristics which are generally recognized as the highest value.”\nIn 1916, a year after Huntington’s work went into circulation, Madison Grant (November 19, 1865 – May 30, 1937), a eugenicist, published his work, The Passing of the Great Race; or, The racial basis of European history, which advanced his opinion of Nordic superiority over the Alpine and Mediterranean peoples.\nThese two thinkers utilized biohistory in their research. However, Huntington’s work was largely dismissed, although never disproven, and Grant’s theories were highly contested and repudiated by the United States and Europe by 1945.\n\nBiohistory encompasses a wide array of study. It can be used in many different areas that are commonplace in historical study as well as new areas of research. Below, several social aspects and their application are considered.\n\nThe interplay between the human condition, natural processes, and the environment is important in the study of biohistory.\nStephen Vickers Boyden, an historian well-noted for his definition of biohistory, has written extensively about this concept. He has studied various aspects of humanity including weaponry, farming, and society in regard to biological factors in order to better understand this relationship.\nUnder the focus of biohistory Boyden examines the evolution of human progress and thought from its inception thousands of years ago. He is also known for his use of adaptation as a major factor for human progress. There are many types of adaptation, including cultural and evolutionary adaptation, which have shaped and allowed humanity to thrive in many areas of the world and survive as a species.\n\nHe classifies human existence into four distinct ecological periods: the hunter-gather phase, the early farming phase, the early urban phase, and the high-energy phase. In each phase there is a unique relationship between humanity and the environment.\n\nBoyden states that if the human race were to survive in the future then there is the necessity to enter into a fifth phase. This new phase would have to be more sustainable than the current one.\nEllsworth Huntington’s research also speaks to the nature of humanity and the environment. His work on the nature of the climate of an area and the rate of perceived civilization provides a framework for the seemingly complex interaction among humans and the environment.\n\nThere are many different methods that can be applied to the study of race and race relations under the biohistorical method. There are scholars, like Robert McElvaine, who say that “biohistory seeks to illuminate aspects of history through a better understanding of human nature – the fundamental traits and predispositions that all humans share and that make us alike” which eliminates the necessity of the study of race. Other scholars, however, see validity in the study of the differences that make people unique. In their study, S. O. Y. Keita and Rick A. Kittles found that “[r]acial thinking rests on the belief that visible human variation connotes fundamental deep differences within the species, which can be packaged into units of near-uniform individuals.”\nRace biohistorians use many different methods in their study. Scholars use dental morphology, bone structure data, and DNA testing to identify certain aspects of racial identity and growth. One common practice is to use scientific data to explain certain aspects of race. One scholar, Heather J.H. Edgar, used teeth samples and other genetic identifiers to test her hypotheses. She used these samples to check evolutionary change of both European Americans and African Americans and societal perceptions of Americans of each group. Through her study she found the idea of “White” changed over a small length of time to include Eastern Europeans, while the idea of “Black” has changed very little over the 400 years that there has been contact with Americans.\nAlthough never actually accepted as valid, the research of Madison Grant, which advocated the idea of Nordic superiority, is another example of racial biohistoric study. His book outlined his belief that the Mediterranean and Alpine races were causing various problems in the political structure of Europe and the United States.\n\nMany race historians have studied biohistory in relation to African Americans. Like Heather Edgar, Lesley M. Rankin-Hill in her dissertation, focused mainly on the conditions, especially the prevalence of disease, of free African Americans, including the population of blacks at the First African Baptist Church in Philadelphia. Through her research, using bone, teeth, and other samples, one of her findings was that “free Philadelphia Afro-Americans were generally healthier than their slave or emancipated counterparts.”\nIn her article, Fatimah Linda Collier Jackson describes various factors and their effects on the African American population. She states that along with the continent of Africa having had the longest history of human habitation\nAfrican American biological variation is also a product of the great Atlantic Diaspora, a movement that was initiated with the social and economic disruptions in Africa preceding the trans-Atlantic trade in enslaved Africans peoples and includes the forced march of prisoners of war to the sea for transport, the dynamics of the horrific Middle Passage and the seasoning process, and the biological and biocultural readjustments of Africans to enslavement in the Americas\n\nThomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 – July 4, 1826), third President of the United States once wrote, “[t]he stronger sex imposes on the weaker. It is civilization alone which replaces women in their natural equality.” This quote is reflective of the relationship that has existed between man and women throughout most of human history.\nRobert S. McElvaine, author of Eve’s Seed: Biology, the Sexes, and Human History, explains the relationship between men and women through a biological framework. His research focuses on the idea that instead of women having penis envy, men have breast and/or womb envy. This can be attributed to the fact that “[p]regnancy, birthing, and nursing have always constituted a ‘no man’s land.’” With these areas that men were not allowed, they\nIn response to this circumstance...have, throughout history and across cultures, set up a variety of ‘no woman’s land’: war, politics, clergy, business, men’s clubs, and so forth. From which activities women are excluded varies from one culture to another, but some form of exclusion can be found in all societies\nMcElvaine argues that it is this distinction that has driven men to subordinate women. Through various studies, he also hypothesizes that women were responsible for the agriculture, which took control and power away from the males, of which males soon took back power. McElvaine asserts that it throughout history, it is this interaction and struggle, among others, between the sexes that led to the subordination of women.\nOf Robert McElvaine and his research, some say that he almost accurately presents the masculine/feminine dichotomy in relation to environmental and biological factors.\n\nAside from the above-stated study of biohistory there is another branch that is more accessible to the public. This branch of biohistory is concerned with using science to not only validate history, but to form historical conclusions about certain events or trends that cannot be noted otherwise. It uses various methods that are also associated with the other branch of study such as DNA testing and other methods to determine specific characteristics of specific individuals and/or artifacts.\nBoth historians, scholars, and amateur historians are able to partake of this study. This is because individuals and organizations are more able to petition for and conduct studies. Individuals can often cause a stir, such as this support group’s letter to the Chicago Historical Society, “I thought that a ‘historical’ society wanted to ferret out truth. Where is that line in the sand drawn—what we ignorant heathens are permitted to learn about historical figures and what is off limits to us? And who draws that line—the Chicago Historical Society?”\nRussell Lewis states that as a biohistorian he “felt compelled to undertake this research by the promise of finding new clues, new evidence, perhaps even new understandings of the past in dirt and stains and grit and grime that typically would be removed from an artifact during cleaning.” This can be considered a common approach and desire for many biohistorians under this method.\n\nOn April 25, 2011, Wynne Parry wrote an article for MSNBC about the unknown child aboard the Titanic. For years there have been speculations about the identity of this young boy. Through misleading evidence, researchers have inaccurately identified the child numerous times. The use of genetics to solve this problem began a decade ago. Robert Parr, an adjunct professor familiar with extraction and DNA testing pursued one claim. Through mitochondrial DNA test of the remains, he tested the DNA with that of the siblings of the perceived child. When results did not match, the search continued. After another false identification due to perceived age, researchers have agreed on the identity of the child, Sidney Goodwin. Even with looking at other factors including teeth structures, researchers misidentified the child. Ryan Parr commented, “Luckily, it was a rare difference, so that is what gives you 98 percent certainty the identification is correct.” The possibility exists that the child may still be inappropriately identified, but this case shows how this branch of biohistory works.\nThis form of biohistory was also used with artifacts of Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865). The Chicago Historical Society has the largest collection of artifacts and items related to the late President. There are many scholars and amateur historians that have the desire to “exemplify biohistorical quests that typically involve the authentication of historical remains and artifacts, the resolution of speculative medical history or paternity disputes, or the commercial potential of genetic analysis.” The CHS was constantly asked to conduct DNA testing on several of Lincoln’s personal items in order to find out various facts including “proof whether or not he suffered from Marfan’s syndrome.” Others have stated interest in conducting aDNA tests on the bloody cloak of Mary Lincoln, wife of Abraham.\nThese types of claims and research are an integral part of this branch of biohistory.\n\nSome scholars have developed a set of ethical standards for biohistorical study. These ethical standards are largely associated with the branch of study that uses science to validate history since the other branch does not necessarily require such standards since the nature of study does not directly have any debilitating consequences.\nThere have been concerns with the scope of biohistorical research as the study has grown in popularity. Russell Lewis stated that a “review of professional codes for twenty-three scientific, historical, and cultural organizations showed a lack of inconsistency and insufficient concern for ethical values that should inform biohistorical investigation.”\nSome aspects of biohistorical research that can be detrimental towards understanding include the destruction of fragile and/or antique artifacts, unreliable and wrong data attributed as fact due to scientific reasoning, and the defamation and other consequences that can affect living populations associated with what is being studied. This last point is especially true of studies dealing with people who are deceased. Because “[b]iohistory often involves an identifiable object and genetic analysis of tissue can reveal information about the paternity, health status, and predispositions of family members” there is the potential for biohistoric research to lead to inappropriate claims as well as other areas of defamation. In one study done by the Chicago Historical Society they “concluded that DNA testing [one of the most widely accepted forms of biohistorical research] would damage the artifacts [here referring to the Society’s Abraham Lincoln collection].” Buenger states that \"[g]reater consideration should be given to basic techniques, such as detailed visual or microscopical examination\" which are less destructive rather than rely on DNA and similar tests.\n\nThe norm of scientific validation and\n\n[b]iohistorical research proposals have generated historical, scientific, and social concerns, including the justification for the proposed research, appropriateness of the study design, destruction of fragile museum specimens, the relevance of informed consent, potential harm to live relatives, cultural respect for the dead, confidentiality of medical and genetic information, and the interpretation of study results\n\nwhich has led to a call for some ethical standards to set a framework for study.\nThrough her evaluation of biohistorical ethical standards Nancy Buenger came up with a series of questions that should be answered by those doing the research. She broke them down into three areas: Historical, Scientific, and Social Considerations. Some of the questions that she states need to be asked include:\nFor a full list of her ethical considerations click here .\n\nOne debate coming out of the rise of biohistorical research centers on whether or not these studies should be conducted based on cultural and societal beliefs. There are those that say “cranial dimensions” and other scientific measurements “should trump notions of cultural affiliation.” Then there are those that ask if this kind of study should be paramount because of certain significances that some societies hold true that can be eliminated with scientific discovery.\n\nAs with any intellectual school of thought, there exist critiques, criticisms, and praise for biohistory. Below are a few examples of both positive and negative critiques.\n\nThe study of biohistory allows for the possibility of collaboration between historians and scientists, in a way that has rarely been seen before. This collaboration allows for better understanding between the disciplines because “[t]hey need the insights of historians to mediate between humans’ evolutionary inheritance and modern behavior as much as historians and social scientists need the insights of biologists to understand better the motivations behind the historical behavior we study.”\nThe study of biohistory allows for historians to consider an aspect of historical research that has not been considered before. Biohistory also opens up the scope of study to the beginning of human existence into prehistory, which goes back many more years than historians normally like to go back.\n\nAside from the collaboration that can be a product of this type of study, there are many scholars who find fault with biohistory. One major critique of biohistory is the continued repetition of ideas from scholar to scholar. In a review of Stephen Boyden’s book, Western Civilization in the Biological Perspective: Patterns in Biohistory, one such scholar states that “[r]eaders who are familiar with other works in biohistory by René Dubos, D. B. Grigg, C.J. Glacken, Donald Worster, and William McNeill will find little that is new.”\nAnother critique is that biohistory encompasses too vast a scope. To start from the beginning of the human condition creates too wide a spread of time, leaving room for much speculation. That is because there is not much data and knowledge about the early times studied, leading biohistorians to speculate and possibly make invalid assumptions. Another critique is that many biohistorians rely on too much science in their research. In trying to make assertions about certain historical issues, many are limited in their areas of study to just focusing on scientific aspects while leaving out others.\n\nOne scholar, in review of Lesley M. Rankin-Hill’s book, A Biohistory of 19th Century Afro-Americans: The Burial Remains of a Pennsylvania Cemetery, stated that while supporting her hypothesis with examples and statistics that she promotes others have not considered, “Rankin-Hill charts out, and then gets bogged down in, the model she will use in her ‘biocultural analysis’” that she fails to present any new evidence.\nReferring to the CHS and the collection of Lincoln’s items, Nancy Brueger states that in their general study\nHistorians are most interested in analyses that illuminate broad cultural, economic, political, or social trends. The authenticity of an individual artifact such as CHS’s cloak would not significantly contribute to the reevaluation of President Lincoln’s assassination or the social impact of this event.\n\nArno Karlen.

Fictional blogs are a changing phenomenon with great potential to young writers.\n\nDuring the 20th century, there were various authors who were leading the change to bring about the end of the print book. They intend to replace it with a mode of expression that was nonlinear and free to cross as many boundaries as the ever-increasing powers of the computers were making possible. Eventually, blog fiction was developed in 1965; however, it was referred to as a hypertext or web. Well-known philosopher and sociologist Ted Nelson coined the term hypertext. He defined hypertext as \"a body of pictorial material interconnected in such a complex way that is could not conveniently be presented or represented on paper.\" Although Ted Nelson was given credit for combining the term and defining hypertext, many people were confused on what tasks it could complete. Most people assumed that it involved linking, like the World Wide Web. After much confusion and speculation about hypertext, the first Hypertext Conference was held in 1985.\n\nFictional blogging is all about expressing ideas and creativity. Blog fiction or fictional blogging help readers find who they are. \n\nFake blogs, also known as flogs, are misleading web sites that launch scareware and post ads and comments to a real blog site to lure readers to the page. The con artists who run these sites currently make an estimated $750 million a year by selling products of miracle cures to phony anti-virus software and items of questionable value. Most of them have one article posing as impartial new report commenting on a miracle product.\n\nFictional blogging can be a personal journal or diary that is posted online.\n\nThough many critics and literary scholars dismiss blog fiction as an inferior and faddish literary form, there is a trend towards the recognition of blogs as a legitimate arena of fiction production. For instance, self-publishing provider Lulu sponsors the Lulu Blooker Prize, which began in 2006. The Blooker prize is an award given to the best \"blook\" of the year: a work of fiction begun as blog fiction and then transformed into a printed publication. Thus, even despite the radical and democratizing potential of blog fiction, printed works still maintain greater authority and \"official\" status in the world of fiction and academia. \n\nSome people say blog fiction is not true blogging and that blogs should not contain fake content. However, blog fiction and regular blogging are all the same. In fictional blogging, writers talk about fictional subject matter and also write about real life events but with fictional characteristics. Blog fiction is what a blogger makes of it.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "34740274", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34740274", "title": "Brian Lamb", "text": "Brian Lamb\n\nBrian Patrick Lamb (; born October 9, 1941) is an American journalist and the founder, executive chairman, and now retired CEO of C-SPAN; an American cable network which provides coverage of the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate as well as other public affairs events. Prior to launching C-SPAN in 1979, Lamb held various communications roles including White House telecommunications policy staffer and Washington bureau chief for \"Cablevision\" magazine. He also served as a commissioned officer in the United States Navy for four years. Lamb has conducted thousands of interviews in his lifetime, including those on C-SPAN's \"Booknotes\" and \"Q&A\", and is known for his unique interview style, focusing on short, direct questions. Over the course of his career Lamb has received numerous honors and awards including the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the National Humanities Medal.\n\nLamb was born in Lafayette, Indiana and lived there until he was 22 years old. Growing up, he wanted to be an entertainer and spent time as a disc jockey and as a drummer in many local bands. Lamb showed an early interest in television and radio: he started his first radio job at a local station in Lafayette, WASK (AM), at the age of 17, working as a disc jockey and selling advertisements. His job at the radio station gave him the opportunity to interview musicians including Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, Count Basie, and The Kingston Trio, while he was still in high school. In 1961, during his junior year at college, he coordinated a television program titled \"Dance Date\", similar to Dick Clark's ABC series, \"American Bandstand\".\n\nAfter graduation from Jefferson High School, Lamb attended Purdue University, where he was a member of Phi Gamma Delta and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in Speech in 1963.\n\nFollowing graduation from Purdue, Lamb was accepted into the United States Navy Officer Candidate School. Upon completion of his training, he served 18 months on the attack cargo ship , and then moved to the Pentagon where he served in the audio/visual office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs. Lamb took up this role midway through the Vietnam War and, in addition to handling queries from radio and television networks, he attended press briefings with Defense Secretary Robert McNamara. In July 1967, following riots in Detroit, Lamb was sent there and tasked with providing recordings of news conferences of Governor George W. Romney of Michigan for the White House Situation Room. He also served as a White House social aide to Lyndon B. Johnson, in which role he escorted Lady Bird Johnson down the aisle at the wedding of Chuck Robb and Lynda Johnson. He later recalled, \"For five years after I got out of the Navy and went back part of the time to Indiana, the only thing I was known to have ever done in my life was to escort Mrs. Johnson down the aisle.\" Lamb spent a total of four years in the U.S. Navy and was a Lieutenant, junior grade at the time that he left. He later said that his time in the U.S. Navy \"was probably the most important thing [he has] ever done\".\n\nIn December 1967, following his Navy service, Lamb's interest in politics led him to interview for the role of personal aide to Richard Nixon during his campaign for the 1968 presidential election, but instead he returned to Indiana . In August 1968, after working at a local television station in Lafayette, he spent ten weeks working for a group called United Citizens for Nixon-Agnew. Following the campaign, he worked as a reporter for UPI Audio and in 1969 became press secretary for Senator Peter H. Dominick (R-Colo.), before becoming an assistant for media and congressional relations to Clay T. Whitehead, director of the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy.\n\nAfter the White House, Lamb returned to journalism as the editor of a biweekly newsletter entitled, \"The Media Report\". While editing \"The Media Report\", he also became the Washington bureau chief of trade magazine \"Cablevision\" for four years, covering telecommunications issues. During this time, he developed his idea of creating a public affairs-oriented cable network.\n\nIn 1977, Lamb submitted to cable television executives a proposal for a nonprofit channel that would broadcast official proceedings of Congress. He later said, \"The risks weren't very significant. No one knew who I was. If I failed, so what?\" The idea was approved in December 1977 and the Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network was created as a private nonprofit business with a board of cable-operating company executives, funded by affiliate fees from cable companies. At its launch the network had a staff of four employees, including Lamb, and an annual budget of US$450,000. The first broadcast occurred on March 19, 1979, with live coverage of the first televised House of Representatives floor debate.\n\nBy 2010, C-SPAN reached over 100 million households, and the network employed 275 individuals in Washington D.C. and at its archives in West Lafayette. Its coverage includes a variety of public affairs programming, including presidential press conferences and Senate hearings, in addition to its gavel-to-gavel coverage of the House and Senate. , C-SPAN consists of three networks: C-SPAN, C-SPAN2 and C-SPAN3 plus a radio station, with more than 170,000 hours of C-SPAN footage available online via the C-SPAN Video Library. Lamb is the former CEO and president of C-SPAN, and now serves as executive chairman of its board of directors. He has described the network as \"in every single way, the antithesis of commercial television\".\n\nIn March 2012, Lamb announced his plan to step down as CEO, handing control over to Rob Kennedy and Susan Swain.\n\nOn C-SPAN, Lamb hosted \"Washington Journal\", \"Booknotes\", and continues to host \"Q&A\", and through these programs has become known for his distinctive interview style. According to him, he learned the basics of broadcasting and interviewing from his high school broadcasting teacher, Bill Fraser, who taught him to \"stay out of the way\" while he conducted interviews. \n\nLamb does not discuss his own political views. \n\nAccording to \"The Advocate\", his style of interviewing is \"Spartan\", and he has stated: \"Too many interviewers intrude too much. … They try to make us think they're smarter than the person they're interviewing. Well, I assume I'm not smarter and if I am smarter I don't want the audience to find out.\" \n\nIf a guest uses a term of art such as \"cloture\" he will ask them to define it for the audience, and invariably will ask the guest where they went to school, his or her children's names, and occupations.\n\nIn his 35 years at C-SPAN, Lamb has conducted thousands of interviews, including 801 editions of \"Booknotes\", a weekly program he hosted focusing on nonfiction books. His first \"Booknotes\" interview was broadcast on April 2, 1989, and the final program aired on December 4, 2004. Over the course of the program, Lamb's interviewees included notable authors, politicians, and world leaders including George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev, Richard Nixon, Colin Powell, and Margaret Thatcher. \n\nThe program's format was described in its tagline, \"One author, one book, one hour\", and Lamb has stated that he spent an average of 20 hours reading and preparing for each interview, though by some counts he spoke for less than five minutes over the course of each program. \n\nLamb has also published five books based on \"Booknotes\" interviews, each a collection of essays written from transcripts of his interviews with authors. The books focus on writing, biographies of figures from American history, American history stories, \"American character\" and the life of Abraham Lincoln, respectively.\n\nAfter \"Booknotes\" ended, Lamb began hosting a new program titled \"Q&A\", featuring interviews with notable figures from politics, technology, education, and media, as well as authors. He also continued to host \"Washington Journal\", C-SPAN's morning call-in program, until 2008.\n\nIn 2011, Lamb donated his collection of books from the \"Booknotes\" series, many containing his personal marginalia, to the rare books collection of George Mason University to create an academic archive.\n\nAs CEO of C-SPAN, Lamb was involved in issues related to ensuring public access to the proceedings of the federal government and also to increasing media access to legislative and judicial proceedings. Lamb opposed the \"must-carry\" provisions of the Cable Television Protection and Competition Act of 1992, which he later stated had led to 10 million Americans losing or experiencing reduced access to C-SPAN. In 1998, he wrote to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, arguing against digital must-carry legislation. During the impeachment of President Clinton, Lamb wrote to then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, urging the Senate to \"keep this process open to the public\" and formally requesting permission for televised coverage of the Senate's deliberations. In addition, he has written to House Speakers of both parties in 1994, 2006 and 2010, requesting that independent media cameras be added to the House floor to allow a more complete view of debates. Lamb has also written to chief justices Rehnquist and Roberts requesting the televising of oral arguments before the Supreme Court of the United States and other federal courts.\n\nIn addition to his five books based on \"Booknotes\" interviews, Lamb has written a book with Richard Norton Smith about the gravesites of American presidents, \"Who's Buried in Grant's Tomb? A Tour of Presidential Gravesites\", and a companion book to a series of C-SPAN interviews with Supreme Court justices, \"The Supreme Court: A C-SPAN Book, Featuring the Justices in their Own Words\".\n\nA complete list of his published works:\n\nLamb has received numerous honors and awards for his work at C-SPAN. He was the recipient of the National Press Club's Fourth Estate Award in 2002. The following year, he was awarded the National Humanities Medal, the Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award, and The Media Institute's Freedom of Speech Award.\n\nIn November 2007, Lamb received the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his work at C-SPAN. The medal is the highest civilian award in the United States, and the White House announcement stated that Lamb had received the award for his \"dedication to a transparent political system and to the free flow of ideas\". In September 2011, Lamb received The Lone Sailor award from the U.S. Navy Memorial, recognizing individuals who begin their careers in the Navy, but go on to have \"exceptional civilian careers\".\n\nIn addition, he has received a number of communications-related awards, including the Manship Prize for Exemplary Use of Media and Technology from Louisiana State University's Manship School of Mass Communication, and the Al Neuharth Award for Excellence in the Media. In 2011, he was awarded the Gaylord Prize for Excellence in Journalism sponsored by the Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Oklahoma, and was named as one of Library of American Broadcasting's 2011 \"Giants of Broadcasting\".\n\nLamb has received numerous honorary doctorates, including one from his alma mater, Purdue University. Purdue also awarded him its Distinguished Alumni Award in 1987 and in 2011 its communications department was renamed as the Brian Lamb School of Communication. In 2015, Lamb was awarded an honorary doctorate from Gettysburg College.\n\nLamb has spent most of his life in Washington, D.C. and currently lives with his wife, Victoria, in Arlington, Virginia. He married Victoria Martin in September 2005. The couple met in grade school at St. Mary's Cathedral and had dated in Washington, D.C. in the 1970s, later restarting their relationship in 1998.

Pancras was entrusted to his uncle Dionysus at age 8,after his parents died, and they both came to Rome. Saint Pancras converted to Christianity while in Rome and at the age of 14, he was beheaded in May 304 AD (around 303 AD Christians were being persecuted for their faith) when he refused to sacrifice to the gods. Before Diocletian, emperor at the time, was impressed with how young Pancras was and how he had the courage to refuse sacrificing to the Gods, so he offered Pancras money and power to leave the Christian faith, but Pancras still refused so he was beheaded and thrown to the side.\n\nHis body was abandoned on the Via Aurelia and was picked up by a Christian matrona, Ottavilla, who buried him. Ottavilla found the body and the head on May 12 304 AD, she picked them up, wrapped Pancras in precious linen and buried him specifically in the Catacombs that stood there. His head was eventually placed in a precious manner in the Basilica, the body lays in an urn and the site still reads \"Hic decollatus fuit Sanctus Pancratius\" (Here San Pancrazio was taken off) \". His body now rests among other martyrs buried in the Catacombs.\n\nThe ancient sources, particularly the Medieval itineraries for pilgrims, mention other martyrs buried within the catacomb: Artemy, Paulinus, Sophia and her three daughters Faith, Hope and Charity. The resting place of the last four martyrs can probably be identified with the so-called cubicle of St. Sophia.\n\nThe cult of St. Pancras highly spread during the Middle Ages, so much so that the catacomb bearing his name was one of the few in Rome that could always be visited by the pilgrims. The once di Calepodio cemetery, where Pancras was buried, changed its name to the Catacombs of San Pancrazio. The first notice about the martyrdom of Pancras comes from the Martyrologium Hieronymianum, that sets the date of the death at 12 May.\n\nBetween the end of the 4th century and the beginning of the 5th, Pope Symmachus built a basilica above the catacomb consecrated to the martyr and a thermal edifice. In 594 Gregory the Great provided the basilica with a cloister. In 625 Pope Honorius I rebuilt the basilica after a Greek-Gothic war, with three naves. Pope Honorius' rebuilding is the basilica that still exists today.\n\nAs mentioned above, San Pancrazio is one of the few catacombs in Rome whose track has not been completely lost during the centuries, even if it has often been confused with other catacombs rising along the Via Aurelia. Antonio Bosio thoroughly studied the cemetery, but he confused it with the cemetery of Calepodius; the two catacombs were distinguished by Giovanni Battista de Rossi in the 19th century.\n\nExcavations carried out at the beginning of the 1930s under the floor of the Basilica of San Pancrazio led to the discovery of a Roman street that cut in two, diagonally to the church; they also brought to light some mausolea and ground graves, both inside the basilica and in its square, such demonstrating that the hypogeous cemetery also included an extended funerary area on the topsoil.\n\nThe Catacomb of San Pancrazio is not in the most perfect condition: the tunnels are mostly destroyed and therefore the visit to see the Catacomb is very short.\n\nThe hypogeous cemerety can be divided into three main regions:\n\n\n\n\nDe Santis L. - Biamonte G., Le catacombe di Roma, Newton & Compton Editori, Rome 1997, pp. 128–132\nCecchelli M., San Pancrazio, Rome, Marietti 1972\nVerrando G.

First published in 1992, in London by Jonathan Cape (having been commissioned by Candida Lacey, now publisher of Myriad Editions), and in New York by Pantheon Books, \"Daughters of Africa\" is regarded as a pioneering work, covering a variety of genres — including fiction, essays, poetry, drama, memoirs and children's writing — and more than 1000 pages in extent. Arranged chronologically, it includes work translated from African languages as well as from Dutch, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.\n\nThe anthology's title derives from an 1831 declaration by Maria W. Stewart (1803–1880), the first African-American woman to give public lectures, in which she said: \"O, ye daughters of Africa, awake! awake! arise! no longer sleep nor slumber, but distinguish yourselves. Show forth to the world that ye are endowed with noble and exalted facutlies.\"\n\n\"Daughters of Africa\" was widely praised on publication. Reviewing it for Black British newspaper \"The Weekly Journal\", Evie Arup wrote: \"\"Daughters of Africa\" is a literary first. Never before has the work of women of African descent world-wide been gathered together in one volume. The breadth of this collection is startling... This book should be required reading for any student of literature, and a standard reference book in school libraries, and, to paraphrase that well known slogan, 'every home should have one.'\" The reviewer from \"The Independent\", however, observed: \"This book may seem to be about literature but in the end it is as much a testament to language: its power to create attitudes as well as its potency as a means of expression.\" According to \"Library Journal\", the anthology is \"an invaluable text for courses on women writers and writers of African descent\", and Keneth Kinnamon in \"Callaloo\" saw it as \"impressive\", noting: \"Brief headnotes and long bibliographies enhance the value of this important volume.\" Lorna Sage in the \"Independent on Sunday\" concluded that \"\"Daughters of Africa\" has a paradoxical universality\", while \"The Washington Post Book World\" called it: \"A magnificent starting place for any reader interested in becoming part of the collective enterprise of discovering and uncovering the silent, forgotten, and underrated voices of black women.\" The reviewer for \"Black Enterprise\" wrote: \"It is a landmark anthology... Busby's first-of-a-kind anthology is a poignant reminder of how vast and varied the body of black women's writing is.\" It has also been described as \"groundbreaking\", as \"one of the most significant assemblages of writers across the diaspora\" and as \"the ultimate reference guide to the writing of 'daughters of Africa'\".\n\nIt was included in \"Sacred Fire: \"QBR\" 100 Essential Black Books\", which said: \"\"Daughters of Africa\" is a monumental achievement because it is the most comprehensive international anthology of oral and written literature by women of African descent ever attempted. (...) The success of the collection is that it clearly illustrates why all women of African descent are connected by showing how closely related are the obstacles, the chasms of cultural indifference, and the disheartening racial and sexual dilemmas they faced. In so doing, the collection captures the range of their singular and combined accomplishments.\n\n\"Daughters of Africa\"′s accomplishment lies in its glorious portrayal of the richness and magnitude of the spiritual well from which we've all drawn inspiration and to where we've all gone for sustenance, and as such, it is a stunning literary masterpiece.\"\n\nThe anthology was on the Royal African Society's list of \"50 Books By African Women That Everyone Should Read\", was named by \"Ms Afropolitan\" as one of \"7 non-fiction books African feminists should read\", features regularly on many required-reading lists, and in the words of Kinna Likimani: \"It remains the ultimate guide to women writers of African descent.\"\n\nIn November 2017 \"Wasafiri\" magazine included a special feature marking the 25th anniversary of the first publication of \"Daughters of Africa\", including an interview with the editor by Ellah Wakatama Allfrey, an article by Candida Lacey and contributions from Edwige-Renee Dro, Angela Barry, Goretti Kyomuhendo, Nadifa Mohamed, Phillippa Yaa de Villiers and Ayobami Adebayo about the influence of the anthology on them. In December 2017, it was announced that a companion volume, to be called \"New Daughters of Africa\", had been commissioned from Margaret Busby by Myriad Editions.\n\nMore than 200 women are featured in \"Daughters of Africa\", including:\n\n\n\n"}

It first aired across all of Channel 4's television channels on the day of the official opening of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, 7 February 2014, having been released on YouTube the previous night, on 6 February 2014. Within 48 hours of its online release (by 8pm 8 February 2014), it had accumulated over half a million views.\n\nThe video opens with a title slide saying: \"Channel 4 proudly presents A SPECIAL WINTER ANTHEM\" and depicts a fictional scenario in which a young woman enters a small auditorium and takes a seat as one of the last people to arrive. A man (Fred Bear of cabaret act Bearlesque), wearing a large brown fur coat, appears on stage and starts singing a song parodying the National Anthem of Russia, with his hand held to his chest.\n\nSeveral members of the audience stand and emulate his gesture. Within a few bars, the singer turns around to face a red curtain behind him; this now opens up to reveal a rainbow arch with light bulbs which illuminate, and the music style changes into an up-beat dance track. Four female dancers, wearing cabaret costumes and sunglasses, appear and peel the fur coat off the singer, while putting a set of fake bear ears on his head. Now only wearing his boots, socks, red shorts with a fake bear tail and his bear ears, the man continues singing and dancing, repeating the chorus: \"Good luck gays on Gay Mountain\".\n\nAs the song progresses, more and more members of the audience get up and dance to the music and silver foil confetti rains from the ceiling. Among the cutaways to the audience, a young woman is seen happily dancing on her own, a male couple kiss and a topless DJ wearing sunglasses - who commentators have noted bears some resemblance to Russian President Vladimir Putin - is also dancing along to the music. Throughout, the lyrics of the song appear as Karaoke-style subtitles. The video ends with the music fading out and a closing slide wishing \"GOOD LUCK TO EVERYONE OUT IN SOCHI.\" It finally cuts to a station ident that features the Channel 4 logo, a super-imposed, revolving, rainbow-coloured prism and the caption: \"BORN RISKY\".\n\nChannel 4's Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Dan Brooke, has been quoted as saying: \"This is a typically Channel 4 way of celebrating the start of the Winter Games and showing our support to all of the athletes out in Sochi, gay or straight.\" The video was scheduled to be broadcast by the channel for a week after its launch and ties in with Channel 4's temporary rebranding of its logo in the rainbow colours, in response to Russian legislation restricting the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, introduced in 2013, as well as widely reported human rights abuses against members of the LGBT community, such as those investigated in Channel 4's own documentary \"Hunted\", which was first broadcast in the \"Dispatches\" series on Wednesday 5 February 2014, in the run up to the Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\n\"Gay Mountain\" drew a largely positive response, with several mainstream media outlets covering its release and viewers' 'likes' outnumbering 'dislikes' on YouTube by 10:1 after two months following its release.\n\nThe night the Gay Mountain video was first aired on Channel 4, a small portion of the song/routine was performed live, to close an episode of The Last Leg. Earlier in the Last Leg episode, they showed a clip of the original Gay Mountain video, and offered half-hearted protest at Channel 4 blatantly mocking Putin and the anti-LGBT attitudes in Russia, when the makers of The Last Leg (which also airs on Channel 4) had been unofficially cautioned by MI6 in the previous weeks, to cut down on their attempts to poke fun at Putin by portraying him as a gay icon. The live performance of Gay Mountain was intercut with a rap - performed by show hosts Adam Hills, Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker - offering their apologies and friendship to Vladimir Putin, and offering hope that he won't have them assassinated with a \"poisoned umbrella.\" \n\nChannel 4 published the lyrics of \"Gay Mountain\" on its own website. They are:\n\nBe fabulous, be free<br>\nWe honour our Queens<br>\nAnd follow the rainbow which leads to the east<br>\n<br>\nGay mountain, gay mountain<br>\nBe proud on gay mountain<br>\nGay mountain, gay mountain<br>\nGood luck gays, on gay mountain<br>\n<br>\nMens and all Men's and Womens and all Womens \"[sic]\"<br>\nCome together tonight, sing with pride<br>\n<br>\nGay mountain, gay mountain<br>\nBe proud on gay mountain<br>\nGay mountain, gay mountain<br>\nGood luck gays, on gay mountain<br>\n<br>\nA \"Gay Mountain Extended Mix\" was posted to SoundCloud on the same date as the YouTube release.\n"}

Her research has shown that fishing cultures had arisen in the area at the end of the Pleistocene period, indicating an occupation from at least 11,000 years ago. In a cave shelf known as the \"Babisuri Shelter\", radiocarbon dating indicated the area may have been occupied 40,000 years ago.\n\nHarumi Fujita was born in Otaru, Hokkaido, Japan and was raised in Sapporo until her fifth birthday. Because her father was a student at the University of Michigan, the family, which included a brother and her parents, moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan for two years, where Fujita began her primary schooling. Returning to Japan, she completed her secondary studies and attended Hokkaido University. After her graduation, Fujita moved to Israel to study Hebrew and met several Mexican students in her classes. Living on a kibbutz, she became interested in archaeology, visiting various sites during her two years in the country. In 1978, she moved to Mexico City and enrolled in archaeology classes at the Escuela Nacional de Antropologia e Historia (ENAH). Completing her course work in 1982, she accompanied Jesus Mora and Baudelina Garcia Uranga to the Baja California Peninsula in northern Mexico to complete her field projects. Writing her thesis on the shellfish gathered by the prehistoric indigenous people on the peninsula, she graduated with a bachelor's degree in archaeology in 1985.\n\nWorking on a waste pile in Baja California Sur, Fujita postulated in 1988, that the settlements along the coast from the remains of sea animals appeared to be transitory.\nIn 1991, Fujita was designated as a researcher with the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) (National Institute of Anthropology and History) and assigned to Baja California Sur working the cape region. Her initial task was to coordinate a survey of the area and document sites. Between 1994 and 1996, Fujita's survey of the Island as well as nearby Isla Partida were compiled as \"El poblamiento de América visto desde la isla Espíritu Santo\" (The settlement of America seen from the island Espiritu Santo) and documented 127 coastal sites, which included caves, open-air campsites, shelters, and waste piles, containing artifacts, burials and cave paintings. Dated to indicate habitation between 10,000 and 21,000 years ago, the findings confirmed occupation of the island long before the arrival of Europeans.\n\nIn 1996, Fujita identified the Babisuri Shelter site on the Island of Espíritu Santo. In stratum III of the shelter, she discovered artifacts made from shell that were radiocarbon dated to yield dates indicating occupation of the site at 40,000 years ago. The findings were significant, as they indicated that habitation of the Americas may have occurred thousands of years before previously estimated. Eighty-eight different dating tests were performed on the site, confirming five layers of soils and three different occupations by inhabitants for the Archaic period. In 2000, Fujita and Judith F. Porcasi evaluated methods in which early hunters might have exploited dolphins. Lack of remains, has caused many theorists to reject that such hunting occurred in northern Mexico, but Fujita and Porcasi postulated that clacking stones together underwater from the side of a boat, could disrupt the sonar of dolphins. In areas where deep water is found near the shoreline, the technique could be used to beach the animals and allow them to be clubbed or speared, as it was in the North Atlantic and the Pacific Islands.\n\nFujita discovered artifacts in 2011, which were c-shaped hooks, similar to those found in Ecuador, Australia and along the coast of the Arabian Sea, indicating that as early as 8,000 to 11,000 years ago, indigenous peoples living in Baja California Sur were engaged in fishing. Fourteen of the hooks were definitively dated to the Terminal Pleistocene era, making the among the oldest fishing hooks known to exist and confirming that fishing cultures had emerged in North America before the Early Holocene period. In 2013, Aníbal Lopez Espinoza published an analysis of the cave paintings documented by Fujita, Dave Huddart and Silva. Expanding her research area along the coast covering the area between La Paz and the Sierra de las Cacachilas (west to east) and between El Novillo and Tecolote Beach (south to north), Fujita identified 172 sites with significant archaeological remains. In all, her work in Baja California Sur has identified over 500 places with traces of historical value. In 2014, she located two caves near Tecolote Beach which confirm ancient settlement of the area to around 10,000 years ago in the Early Holocene period. Similarly to earlier sites found on Espíritu Santo, marine resources and shells were frequently used by the inhabitants. Continuing her work on the site, she discovered 61 burial sites, which show funerary characteristics of dual burials for the ancient inhabitants.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9715234", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9715234", "title": "History of media studies", "text": "History of media studies\n\nThis article outlines the history of media studies.\n\nThough not yet named as such, media studies' roots are in the Chicago School and thinkers such as John Dewey, Charles Cooley and George Mead. These authors saw American society on the cusp of positive social change toward pure democracy. Mead argued that for an ideal society to exist, a form of communication must be developed to allow the unique individual to appreciate the attitudes, viewpoints and positions of others unlike himself, and allow him to be understood by others as well. Mead believed that this \"new media\" would allow humans to empathize with others, and therefore moves toward an \"ideal of human society.\" Where Mead sees an ideal society, Dewey names it the \"Great Community,\" and further asserts the assumption that humans are intelligent enough for self-government, and that that knowledge is \"a function of association and communication.\" Similarly, Cooley asserts that political communication makes public opinion possible, which in turn promotes democracy. Each of these authors represent the Chicago School’s attention to electronic communication as a facilitator of democracy, its faith in the informed electorate, and its focus on the individual as opposed to the mass.\n\nThe social impact of mass communication has been studied at The New School University in New York since its founding in 1919. The first college course to investigate the motion picture was offered here in 1926. Marshall McLuhan's colleague, John Culkin, brought his Center for Understanding Media to The New School in 1975 and The New School began offering the Master of Arts degree in Media Studies, one of the first graduate programs of its kind. Today, among other programs, MA in Media Studies is still being offered by School of Media Studies, The New School, which will celebrate 40th anniversary of Media Studies at The New School during the academic year 2015-2016\n\nBetween the First and Second World Wars, the Institute for Propaganda Analysis briefly rose to importance. Their definition of propaganda was \"expression of opinion or action by individuals or groups deliberately designed to influence opinion or actions of other individuals or groups with reference to predetermined ends.\" \n\nHarold Lasswell, who worked in the paradigm of the Chicago School of sociology wrote Propaganda Technique in the World War, which included this definition of propaganda:\n\"Propaganda in the broadest sense is the technique of influencing human action by the manipulation of representations. These representations may take spoken, written, pictorial or musical form.\"\n\nThese definitions of propaganda clearly show that this was a school of thought that focused on media effects, as it highlighted the influence that media could have over its audiences attitudes and actions.\n\nEpitomizing this early school of media effects studies are experiments done by The Experimental Section of the Research Branch of the U.S. War Department's Information and Education Division. In the experiments, the effects of various U.S. wartime propaganda films on soldiers were observed.\n\nCurrent Propaganda studies are applied into many fields besides politics. Herman described a propaganda model as \"a model of media behavior and performance, not of media effects.\" (Herman, 2000, p. 63) He argued: \"They are profit-seeking business, owned by very wealthy people (or other companies); and they are funded largely by advertisers who are also profit-seeking entities, and who want their advertisements to appear in a supportive selling environment.\" He also presented \"five factors: owner ship, advertising, sourcing, flak and anti-communist ideology-work as filters through which information must pass, and that individually and often in cumulative fashion they greatly influence media choices.\" Until now, there is no conclusion of propaganda, debate still continues.\n\nTypified by the philosophical and theoretical orientations of Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, and Herbert Marcuse, the Frankfurt school contributed greatly to the development and application of critical theory in media studies. Their Marxist critique of market-driven media was critical of its atomizing and leveling effects.\n\nThe Frankfurt school also lamented the effects of the \"culture industry\" on the production and appreciation of art. For example, in \"A Social Critique of Radio Music\", Adorno asserts: \"…music has ceased to be a human force and is consumed like other consumers’ goods. This produces ‘commodity listening’…The listener suspends all intellectual activity.\"\n\nAs the Frankfurt school lamented on the effects of the \"culture industry\" they also began to identify mass culture and high culture as two distinct entities. Scholars like Benjamin (1936) and Adorno (1945) can be credited with what would eventually become known as popular culture and high culture. Their finite distinction of equating original production with ritualistic behavior as compared with mass culture that finds its identifying symbols in reproductions. These reproductions are souless and lacking in definition and originality.\n\nThe less paradigm in media studies since the Second World War has been associated with the ideas, methods and findings of Paul F. Lazarsfeld and his school: media effect studies. Their studies focused on measurable, short-term behavioral ‘effects’ of media and concluded that the media played a limited role in influencing public opinion. The \"Limited-Effects\" Model developed by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues from Columbia was highly influential in the development of media studies. The model claims the mass media has \"limited-effects\" on voting patterns. Voters are influenced, rather, through the ‘two-step flow’ model, the idea that media messages are disseminated through personal interaction with ‘opinion leaders’.\n\nThe model of limited- effects was so influential that the question of media \"effects\" on politics was left largely unaddressed until the late 1960s. Eventually Mass Communication scholars began to study political behavior again and the limited-effects model was called into question.\n\nAs a response to the previous emphasis upon media effects, from the 1970s researchers became interested in how audiences make sense of media texts. The \"uses and gratifications\" model, associated with Jay Blumler and Elihu Katz, reflected this growing interest in the 'active audience'. One such example of this type of research was conducted by Hodge and Tripp, and separately Palmer, about how school-children make sense of the Australian soap opera \"Prisoner\". They found that pupils could identify with the prisoners: they were \"shut in\", separated from their friends and wouldn't be there had they not been made to be, etc. Also, the children could compare the wardens to their teachers: \"the hard-bitten old [one], the soft new one, the one you could take advantage of...\"John Fiske summarises:\n\nThe children inserted meanings of the program into their social experience of school in a way that informed both -- the meanings of school and the meanings of \"Prisoner\" were each influenced by the other, and the fit between them validated the other.\n"}

A prolific author, he is perhaps best remembered for his work on the \"Dictionary of Ming Biography, 1368–1644\".\n\nLuther Carrington Goodrich was born on September 21, 1894, in Tongzhou, a southeastern suburb of Beijing, where his parents were serving as Protestant missionaries. His father, Chauncey Goodrich (b.1836), had published \"A Pocket Dictionary (Chinese-English) and Pekingese Syllabary\" in 1891 and among the nephews of Chauncey's great-grandfather Josiah (b.1731) were a US Senator and US Representative.\n\nAs a young child, he lived through the Siege of the International Legations in Beijing; he was able to remember some of these events even in his old age, when he must have been one of the last survivors. He attended the Chefoo School in Yantai (Shandong), the Oberlin Academy in Ohio, and Williams College, from which he graduated in 1917. In 1918, soon after the United States entered World War I, Goodrich joined the US Army and was sent to France, where he worked with the Chinese Labour Corps in France, workers who were brought to France during the war, and were now participating in the post-war rebuilding of the country.\n\nIn 1920, Goodrich started graduate work at Columbia University, but soon left for China, where he worked for the China Medical Board of the Rockefeller Foundation. Back at Columbia in 1925, he received his master's degree in 1927 and Ph.D. in 1934. Continued at Columbia as a faculty member, attaining the rank of full Professor in 1945. Excluding a few short breaks spent as a visiting professor in institutions abroad (as far as India, Japan, and Australia), he spent the rest of his career at Columbia University; even after his retirement from teaching, he still remained associated with Columbia as Dean Lung Professor Emeritus of Chinese.\n\nDuring his academic career, Goodrich published a number of works on Chinese history. In 1956-57, he was President, Association for Asian Studies.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "27472075", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27472075", "title": "Maritime Archaeology Trust", "text": "Maritime Archaeology Trust\n\nThe Maritime Archaeology Trust (formerly the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology) is a charitable trust that researches and excavates maritime archaeology and heritage in Great Britain. Historically, their core activities were focused around Hampshire, the Isle of Wight and the Solent, but now they work in other parts of the country and on international projects.\n\nThe discovery of the wreck of HMS \"Pomone\" at The Needles in 1969 led the Isle of Wight Council to fund and organise a team to research and excavate the site. As more wrecks were discovered in the following decades, the Isle of Wight Maritime Heritage Project was formed. The project originally focused on the Yarmouth Roads Protected Wreck Site but also began to identify Mesolithic sites on the seabed of the Solent. When central government funds were withdrawn, the project was re-organised as the Isle of Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology in 1990. The Trust managed the excavation of several sites and became the licensee for many of them. In 1991, with support from Hampshire County Council, the Trust's scope expanded and it became the Hampshire and Wight Trust for Maritime Archaeology. In 2013, it became the Maritime Archaeology Trust.\n\nThe charity has since investigated a great deal of maritime archaeology around the Solent, including shipwrecks, submerged landscapes and inter-tidal foreshore sites. They have also conducted projects as far away as Gibraltar and the Farasan Islands.\n\nIn 1999 divers from the Trust discovered the Mesolithic settlement site of Bouldnor Cliff. The site is offshore of Bouldnor on the Isle of Wight and about 11 metres below the surface of the Solent. Attention was first drawn to the site when divers observed a lobster discarding worked flint tools from its burrow. Since then, regular fieldwork has revealed that Bouldnor was almost certainly a settlement site approximately 8,000 years ago (6,000 BC), at a time when lower sea levels meant that the Solent was an extensive river valley. Work done so far has revealed that the technology of Mesolithic settlers was probably 2,000 years ahead of what had previously been believed.\n\nBetween 2006 and 2009, the Trust ran a joint community archaeology project at Forton Lake, with the Nautical Archaeology Society, cataloguing the wide range of hulks there. The project was designed to raise local awareness and foster a sense of local pride and ownership amongst nearby residents in Gosport.\n\nIn a joint project with Southsea Sub Aqua Club, the Trust has investigated two Centaur tanks from a capsized Landing Craft Tank in the Solent, as part of a case study to see if land based legislation can be used to protect maritime archaeology.\n\nThe Trust investigated a 'mystery wreck' on Horse Tail Sands in the Solent between 2003 and 2011. It was not until 2011 that the Trust was able to confirm the vessel's identity as the \"Flower of Ugie\", a 19th-century barque. As well as fully recording the vessel's remains, the Trust replicated the process of wreck research and identification in a teaching pack for children.\n\nThe Trust runs an active outreach and schools programme and operates a \"Maritime Bus\" to make maritime archaeology more accessible to the general public. The bus attends regular events in the south coast, including school, community and other public events. The Trust also runs the Sunken Secrets exhibition at Fort Victoria on the Isle of Wight.\n\nIn 2011, the Trust was awarded a Europa Nostra award for Category 4: Education, Training and Awareness Raising, for \"raising the profile of maritime heritage and archaeology\", recognising the numerous ways in which the Trust teaches audiences of all types about maritime heritage.\n\nIn 2004, the Trust formed Maritime Archaeology Ltd as a commercial trading arm in order to provide archaeological contractual services.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "885795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=885795", "title": "Modern history", "text": "Modern history\n\nModern history, the modern period or the modern era, is the linear, global, historiographical approach to the time frame after post-classical history. Modern history can be further broken down into periods:\n\nThis article primarily covers the 1800–1950 time period with a brief summary of 1500–1800. For a more in depth article on modern times before 1800, see Early Modern period.\n\nIn the pre-modern era, many people's sense of self and purpose was often expressed via a faith in some form of deity, be it that in a single God or in many gods. Pre-modern cultures have not been thought of creating a sense of distinct individuality, though. Religious officials, who often held positions of power, were the spiritual intermediaries to the common person. It was only through these intermediaries that the general masses had access to the divine. Tradition was sacred to ancient cultures and was unchanging and the social order of ceremony and morals in a culture could be strictly enforced.\n\nThe term \"modern\" was coined in the 16th century to indicate present or recent times (ultimately derived from the Latin adverb \"modo\", meaning \"just now\"). The European Renaissance (c. 1420–1630), which marked the transition between the Late Middle Ages and Early Modern times, started in Italy and was spurred in part by the rediscovery of classical art and literature, as well as the new perspectives gained from the Age of Discovery and the invention of the telescope and microscope, expanding the borders of thought and knowledge.\n\nIn contrast to the pre-modern era, Western civilization made a gradual transition from pre-modernity to modernity when scientific methods were developed which led many to believe that the use of science would lead to all knowledge, thus throwing back the shroud of myth under which pre-modern peoples lived. New information about the world was discovered via empirical observation, versus the historic use of reason and innate knowledge.\n\nThe term \"Early Modern\" was introduced in the English language in the 1930s to distinguish the time between what has been called the Middle Ages and time of the late Enlightenment (1800) (when the meaning of the term \"Modern Ages\" was developing its contemporary form). It is important to note that these terms stem from European history. In usage in other parts of the world, such as in Asia, and in Muslim countries, the terms are applied in a very different way, but often in the context with their contact with European culture in the Age of Discovery.\n\nIn the Contemporary era, there were various socio-technological trends. Regarding the 21st century and the late modern world, the Information Age and computers were forefront in use, not completely ubiquitous but often present in everyday life. The development of Eastern powers was of note, with China and India becoming more powerful. In the Eurasian theater, the European Union and Russian Federation were two forces recently developed. A concern for Western world, if not the whole world, was the late modern form of terrorism and the warfare that has resulted from the contemporary terrorist acts.\n\nThe modern period has been a period of significant development in the fields of science, politics, warfare, and technology. It has also been an age of discovery and globalization. During this time, the European powers and later their colonies, began a political, economic, and cultural colonization of the rest of the world.\n\nBy the late 19th and 20th centuries, modernist art, politics, science and culture has come to dominate not only Western Europe and North America, but almost every civilized area on the globe, including movements thought of as opposed to the west and globalization. The modern era is closely associated with the development of individualism, capitalism, urbanization and a belief in the possibilities of technological and political progress.\n\nWars and other perceived problems of this era, many of which come from the effects of rapid change, and the connected loss of strength of traditional religious and ethical norms, have led to many reactions against modern development. Optimism and belief in constant progress has been most recently criticized by postmodernism while the dominance of Western Europe and Anglo-America over other continents has been criticized by postcolonial theory.\n\nOne common conception of modernity is the condition of Western history since the mid-15th century, or roughly the European development of movable type and the printing press. In this context the \"modern\" society is said to develop over many periods, and to be influenced by important events that represent breaks in the continuity.\n\nThe modern era includes the early period, called the early modern period, which lasted from c. 1500 to around c. 1800 (most often 1815). Particular facets of early modernity include:\n\nImportant events in the early modern period include:\nThis combination of epoch events totally changed thinking and thought in the early modern period, and so their dates serve as well as any to separate the old from the new modes.\n\nAs an Age of Revolutions dawned, beginning with those revolts in America and France, political changes were then pushed forward in other countries partly as a result of upheavals of the Napoleonic Wars and their impact on thought and thinking, from concepts from nationalism to organizing armies.\n\nThe early period ended in a time of political and economic change as a result of mechanization in society, the American Revolution, the first French Revolution; other factors included the redrawing of the map of Europe by the of the Congress of Vienna and the peace established by Second Treaty of Paris which ended the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nAs a result of the Industrial Revolution and the earlier political revolutions, the worldviews of Modernism emerged. The industrialization of many nations was initiated with the industrialization of Britain. Particular facets of the late modernity period include:\n\nOther important events in the development of the Late modern period include:\n\nOur most recent eraModern Timesbegins with the end of these revolutions in the 19th century, and includes the World Wars era (encompassing World War I and World War II) and the emergence of socialist countries that led to the Cold War. The \"contemporary era\" follows shortly afterward with the explosion of research and increase of knowledge known as the Information Age in the latter 20th and the early 21st century. Today's Postmodern era is seen in widespread digitality.\n\nHistorians consider the early modern period to be approximately between 1500 and 1800. It follows the Late Middle Ages and is marked by the first European colonies, the rise of strong centralized governments, and the beginnings of recognizable nation-states that are the direct antecedents of today's states.\n\nThe expansion of Islam took place in North and East Africa. In West Africa, various native nations existed. The Indian Empires and civilizations of Southeast Asia were a vital link in the spice trade. On the Indian subcontinent, the Mughal Empire existed. The archipelagic empires, the Sultanate of Malacca and later the Sultanate of Johor, controlled the southern areas.\n\nVarious Chinese dynasties and Japanese shogunates controlled the Asian sphere. In Japan, the Edo period from 1600 to 1868 is also referred to as the early modern period. In Korea, the early modern period is considered to have lasted from the rise of the Joseon Dynasty to the enthronement of King Gojong. In the Americas, Pre-Columbian peoples had built a large and varied civilization, including the Aztec Empire and alliance, the Inca civilization, the Mayan Empire and cities, and the Chibcha. In the west, kingdoms of Europe moved in the direction of reformation and expansion. Russia reached the Pacific coast in 1647 and consolidated its control over the Russian Far East in the 19th century.\n\nLater religious trends of the period saw the end of the aforementioned Muslim expansion. Christians and Christendom saw the end of the Crusades and of religious unity under the Roman Catholic Church. It was during this time that the Inquisitions and the Protestant Reformation took place.\n\nDuring the early modern period, an age of discovery and trade was undertaken by the Western European nations. Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France went on a colonial expansion and took possession of lands and set up colonies in Africa, southern Asia, and North and South America. Turkey colonized Southeastern Europe, and parts of the West Asia and North Africa. Russia took possession in Eastern Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nIn China, urbanization increased as the population grew and as the division of labor grew more complex. Large urban centers, such as Nanjing and Beijing, also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil. Despite the xenophobia and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of neo-Confucianism, China under the later Ming Dynasty became isolated, prohibiting the construction of ocean going sea vessels. Despite isolationist policies the Ming Economy still suffered from an inflation due to an overabundance of Spanish New World silver entering its economy through new European colonies such as Macao. Ming China was further strained by victorious but costly wars to protect Korea from Japanese Invasion.\n\nThe Qing dynasty (1644–1912) was founded after the fall of the Ming, the last Han Chinese dynasty, by the Manchus. The Manchus were formerly known as the Jurchens. When Beijing was captured by Li Zicheng's peasant rebels in 1644, the Chongzhen Emperor, the last Ming emperor, committed suicide. The Manchus then allied with former Ming general Wu Sangui and seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty. The Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule of China proper. Schoppa, the editor of \"The Columbia Guide to Modern Chinese History\" argues, \"A date around 1780 as the beginning of modern China is thus closer to what we know today as historical 'reality'. It also allows us to have a better baseline to understand the precipitous decline of the Chinese polity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.\"\n\nIn pre-modern Japan following the Sengoku period of \"warring states\", central government had been largely reestablished by Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi during the Azuchi–Momoyama period. After the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, central authority fell to Tokugawa Ieyasu who completed this process and received the title of \"shōgun\" in 1603.\nSociety in the Japanese \"Tokugawa period\" (Edo society), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class hierarchy originally established by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The \"daimyōs\" (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of samurai, with the farmers, artisans, and traders ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the \"Sakoku\" policy. Literacy among the Japanese people rose in the two centuries of isolation.\n\nIn some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, \"daimyōs\" and samurai were more or less identical, since \"daimyōs\" might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this social stratification system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the peasantry were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.\n\nOn the Indian subcontinent, the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century. The \"classic period\" ended with the death and defeat of Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707 by the rising Hindu Maratha Empire, although the dynasty continued for another 150 years. During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the Third Battle of Panipat which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.\n\nThe development of New Imperialism saw the conquest of nearly all eastern hemisphere territories by colonial powers. The commercial colonization of India commenced in 1757, after the Battle of Plassey, when the Nawab of Bengal surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company, in 1765, when the Company was granted the \"diwani\", or the right to collect revenue, in Bengal and Bihar, or in 1772, when the Company established a capital in Calcutta, appointed its first Governor-General, Warren Hastings, and became directly involved in governance.\n\nThe Maratha states, following the Anglo-Maratha wars, eventually lost to the British East India Company in 1818 with the Third Anglo-Maratha War. The rule lasted until 1858, when, after the Indian rebellion of 1857 and consequent of the Government of India Act 1858, the British government assumed the task of directly administering India in the new British Raj. In 1819 Stamford Raffles established Singapore as a key trading post for Britain in their rivalry with the Dutch. However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an Anglo-Dutch treaty demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.\n\nThe Dutch East India Company (1800) and British East India Company (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only Thailand was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.\n\nMany major events caused Europe to change around the start of the 16th century, starting with the Fall of Constantinople in 1453, the fall of Muslim Spain and the discovery of the Americas in 1492, and Martin Luther's Protestant Reformation in 1517. In England the modern period is often dated to the start of the Tudor period with the victory of Henry VII over Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. Early modern European history is usually seen to span from the start of the 15th century, through the Age of Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries, until the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century.\n\nRussia experienced territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of Cossacks. Cossacks were warriors organized into military communities, resembling pirates and pioneers of the New World. The native land of the Cossacks is defined by a line of Russian/Ruthenian town-fortresses located on the border with the steppe and stretching from the middle Volga to Ryazan and Tula, then breaking abruptly to the south and extending to the Dnieper via Pereyaslavl. This area was settled by a population of free people practicing various trades and crafts.\n\nIn 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the Zaporozhian Cossacks in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the Khmelnytsky Uprising, because of the social and religious oppression they suffered under Polish rule. In 1654 the Ukrainian leader, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, Aleksey I. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another Russo-Polish War (1654–1667). Finally, Ukraine was split along the river Dnieper, leaving the western part (or Right-bank Ukraine) under Polish rule and eastern part (Left-bank Ukraine and Kiev) under Russian. Later, in 1670–71 the Don Cossacks led by Stenka Razin initiated a major uprising in the Volga region, but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels. In the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. Russian explorers pushed eastward primarily along the Siberian river routes, and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in the Eastern Siberia, on the Chukchi Peninsula, along the Amur River, and on the Pacific coast. In 1648 the Bering Strait between Asia and North America was passed for the first time by Fedot Popov and Semyon Dezhnyov.\n\nTraditionally, the European intellectual transformation of and after the Renaissance bridged the Middle Ages and the Modern era. The Age of Reason in the Western world is generally regarded as being the start of modern philosophy, and a departure from the medieval approach, especially Scholasticism. Early 17th-century philosophy is often called the Age of Rationalism and is considered to succeed Renaissance philosophy and precede the Age of Enlightenment, but some consider it as the earliest part of the Enlightenment era in philosophy, extending that era to two centuries. The 18th century saw the beginning of secularization in Europe, rising to notability in the wake of the French Revolution.\n\nThe Age of Enlightenment is a time in Western philosophy and cultural life centered upon the 18th century in which reason was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy for authority. Enlightenment gained momentum more or less simultaneously in many parts of Europe and America. Developing during the Enlightenment era, Renaissance humanism as an intellectual movement spread across Europe. The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). The term \"umanista\" comes from the latter part of the 15th century. The people were associated with the \"studia humanitatis\", a novel curriculum that was competing with the \"quadrivium\" and scholastic logic.\n\nRenaissance humanism took a close study of the Latin and Greek classical texts, and was antagonistic to the values of scholasticism with its emphasis on the accumulated commentaries; and humanists were involved in the sciences, philosophies, arts and poetry of classical antiquity. They self-consciously imitated classical Latin and deprecated the use of medieval Latin. By analogy with the perceived decline of Latin, they applied the principle of \"ad fontes\", or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning.The quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns was a literary and artistic quarrel that heated up in the early 1690s and shook the Académie française. The opposing two sides were, the Ancients (\"Anciens\") who constrain choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of Antiquity and the Moderns (\"Modernes\"), who supported the merits of the authors of the century of Louis XIV. Fontenelle quickly followed with his \"Digression sur les anciens et les modernes\" (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.\n\nThe Scientific Revolution was a period when European ideas in classical physics, astronomy, biology, human anatomy, chemistry, and other classical sciences were rejected and led to doctrines supplanting those that had prevailed from Ancient Greece to the Middle Ages which would lead to a transition to modern science. This period saw a fundamental transformation in scientific ideas across physics, astronomy, and biology, in institutions supporting scientific investigation, and in the more widely held picture of the universe. Individuals started to question all manners of things and it was this questioning that led to the Scientific Revolution, which in turn formed the foundations of contemporary sciences and the establishment of several modern scientific fields.\n\nToward the middle and latter stages of the Age of Revolution, the French political and social revolutions and radical change saw the French governmental structure, previously an absolute monarchy with feudal privileges for the aristocracy and Catholic clergy transform, changing to forms based on Enlightenment principles of citizenship and inalienable rights. The first revolution led to government by the National Assembly, the second by the Legislative Assembly, and the third by the Directory.\n\nThe changes were accompanied by violent turmoil which included the trial and execution of the king, vast bloodshed and repression during the Reign of Terror, and warfare involving every other major European power. Subsequent events that can be traced to the Revolution include the Napoleonic Wars, two separate restorations of the monarchy, and two additional revolutions as modern France took shape. In the following century, France would be governed at one point or another as a republic, constitutional monarchy, and two different empires.\n\nDuring the French Revolution, the National Assembly, which existed from June 17 to July 9 of 1789, was a transitional body between the Estates-General and the National Constituent Assembly.\n\nThe Legislative Assembly was the legislature of France from October 1, 1791 to September 1792. It provided the focus of political debate and revolutionary law-making between the periods of the National Constituent Assembly and of the National Convention.\n\nThe Executive Directory was a body of five Directors that held executive power in France following the Convention and preceding the Consulate. The period of this regime (2 November 1795 until 10 November 1799), commonly known as the Directory (or Directoire) era, constitutes the second to last stage of the French Revolution. Napoleon, before seizing the title of Emperor, was elected as First Consul of the Consulate of France.\n\nThe campaigns of French Emperor and General Napoleon Bonaparte characterized the Napoleonic Era. Born on Corsica as the French invaded, and dying suspiciously on the tiny British Island of St. Helena, this brilliant commander, controlled a French Empire that, at its height, ruled a large portion of Europe directly from Paris, while many of his friends and family ruled countries such as Spain, Poland, several parts of Italy and many other Kingdoms Republics and dependencies. The Napoleonic Era changed the face of Europe forever, and old Empires and Kingdoms fell apart as a result of the mighty and \"Glorious\" surge of Republicanism.\n\nItalian unification was the political and social movement that annexed different states of the Italian peninsula into the single state of Italy in the 19th century. There is a lack of consensus on the exact dates for the beginning and the end of this period, but many scholars agree that the process began with the end of Napoleonic rule and the Congress of Vienna in 1815, and approximately ended with the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, though the last \"città irredente\" did not join the Kingdom of Italy until after World War I.\n\nToward the end of the early modern period, Europe was dominated by the evolving system of mercantile capitalism in its trade and the New Economy. European states and politics had the characteristic of Absolutism. The French power and English revolutions dominated the political scene. There eventually evolved an international balance of power that held at bay a great conflagration until years later.\n\nThe end date of the early modern period is usually associated with the Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in about 1750. Another significant date is 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution, which drastically transformed the state of European politics and ushered in the Prince Edward Era and modern Europe.\n\nThe French and Indian Wars were a series of conflicts in North America that represented the actions there that accompanied the European dynastic wars. In Quebec, the wars are generally referred to as the Intercolonial Wars. While some conflicts involved Spanish and Dutch forces, all pitted Great Britain, its colonies and American Indian allies on one side and France, its colonies and Indian allies on the other.\n\nThe expanding French and British colonies were contending for control of the western, or interior, territories. Whenever the European countries went to war, there were actions within and by these colonies although the dates of the conflict did not necessarily exactly coincide with those of the larger conflicts.\n\nBeginning the Age of Revolution, the American Revolution and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also called American War of Independence).\n\nThe American Revolution began with fighting at Lexington and Concord. On July 4, 1776, they issued the Declaration of Independence, which proclaimed their independence from Great Britain and their formation of a cooperative union. In June 1776, Benjamin Franklin was appointed a member of the Committee of Five that drafted the Declaration of Independence. Although he was temporarily disabled by gout and unable to attend most meetings of the Committee, Franklin made several small changes to the draft sent to him by Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe rebellious states defeated Great Britain in the American Revolutionary War, the first successful colonial war of independence. While the states had already rejected the governance of Parliament, through the Declaration the new United States now rejected the legitimacy of the monarchy to demand allegiance. The war raged for seven years, with effective American victory, followed by formal British abandonment of any claim to the United States with the Treaty of Paris.\n\nThe Philadelphia Convention set up the current United States; the United States Constitution ratification the following year made the states part of a single republic with a limited central government. The Bill of Rights, comprising ten constitutional amendments guaranteeing many fundamental civil rights and freedoms, was ratified in 1791.\n\nThe decolonization of the Americas was the process by which the countries in the Americas gained their independence from European rule. Decolonization began with a series of revolutions in the late 18th and early-to-mid-19th centuries. The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century, from 1808 until 1829, directly related to the Napoleonic French invasion of Spain. The conflict started with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville.\n\nWhen the Central Junta fell to the French, numerous new Juntas appeared all across the Americas, eventually resulting in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south, to Mexico in the north. After the death of the king Ferdinand VII, in 1833, only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the Spanish–American War in 1898. Unlike the Spanish, the Portuguese did not divide their colonial territory in America. The captaincies they created were subdued to a centralized administration in Salvador (later relocated to Rio de Janeiro) which reported directly to the Portuguese Crown until its independence in 1822, becoming the Empire of Brazil.\n\n[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM]]\n\nThe development of the [[steam engine]] started the Industrial Revolution in [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]. The steam engine was created to pump water from coal mines, enabling them to be deepened beyond [[groundwater]] levels. The date of the Industrial Revolution is not exact. [[Eric Hobsbawm]] held that it \"broke out\" in the 1780s and was not fully felt until the 1830s or 1840s, while [[T.S. Ashton]] held that it occurred roughly between 1760 and 1830 (in effect the reigns of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], The [[English Regency|Regency]], and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]). The great changes of centuries before the 19th were more connected with ideas, religion or military conquest, and technological advance had only made small changes in the material wealth of ordinary people.\n\nThe first Industrial Revolution merged into the Second Industrial Revolution around 1850, when technological and economic progress gained momentum with the development of steam-powered ships and railways, and later in the 19th century with the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[electric power]] generation. The Second Industrial Revolution was a phase of the Industrial Revolution; labeled as the separate Technical Revolution. From a technological and a social point of view there is no clean break between the two. Major innovations during the period occurred in the chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel industries. Specific advancements included the introduction of oil fired steam turbine and internal combustion driven steel ships, the development of the airplane, the practical commercialization of the automobile, mass production of consumer goods, the perfection of canning, mechanical refrigeration and other food preservation techniques, and the invention of the telephone.\n\n[[Industrialization]] is the process of social and economic change whereby a human group is transformed from a pre-industrial society into an industrial one. It is a subdivision of a more general [[modernization]] process, where [[social change]] and [[economic development]] are closely related with [[innovation|technological innovation]], particularly with the development of large-scale energy and metallurgy production. It is the extensive organization of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing. Industrialization also introduces a form of philosophical change, where people obtain a different attitude towards their [[nature|perception of nature]].\n\n[[File:First passenger railway 1830.jpg|left|thumb|[[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] from 1830, world's first railway.]]\nAn [[economic system|economy]] based on [[manual labour]] was replaced by one dominated by industry and the manufacture of machinery. It began with the mechanization of the [[textile]] industries and the development of [[iron]]-making techniques, and trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, improved roads, and then [[rail transport|railways]].\n\nThe introduction of [[steam engine|steam power]] (fuelled primarily by [[coal]]) and powered machinery (mainly in [[textile manufacturing]]) underpinned the dramatic increases in production capacity. The development of all-metal [[machine tool]]s in the first two decades of the 19th century facilitated the manufacture of more production machines for manufacturing in other industries.\n\nThe modern [[petroleum industry]] started in 1846 with the discovery of the process of refining [[kerosene]] from [[coal]] by [[Nova Scotia]]n [[Abraham Pineo Gesner]]. [[Ignacy Łukasiewicz]] improved Gesner's method to develop a means of refining kerosene from the more readily available \"rock oil\" (\"petr-oleum\") [[seep]]s in 1852 and the first rock oil mine was built in [[Bóbrka, Krosno County|Bóbrka]], near [[Krosno]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in the following year. In 1854, [[Benjamin Silliman]], a science professor at [[Yale University]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], was the first to fractionate petroleum by distillation. These discoveries rapidly spread around the world.\n\n[[File:Teslathinker.jpg|thumb|Nikola Tesla with his high-frequency transformer at East Houston Street, New York|alt=|193x193px]]\n\nEngineering achievements of the revolution ranged from electrification to developments in materials science. The advancements made a great contribution to the quality of life. In the first revolution, [[Lewis Paul]] was the original inventor of roller spinning, the basis of the water frame for spinning cotton in a cotton mill. [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]]'s improvements to the steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution in both the Kingdom of Great Britain and the world.\n\nIn the latter part of the second revolution, [[Thomas Alva Edison]] developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world and is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. In 1882, Edison switched on the world's first large-scale [[electrical supply network]] that provided 110 volts direct current to fifty-nine customers in lower Manhattan. Also toward the end of the second industrial revolution, [[Nikola Tesla]] made many contributions in the field of [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe Industrial Revolutions were major [[technology|technological]], [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]], and [[culture|cultural]] changes in late 18th and early 19th centuries that began in Britain and spread throughout the world. The effects spread throughout [[Western Europe]] and North America during the 19th century, eventually affecting the majority of the world. The impact of this change on [[society]] was enormous and is often compared to the [[Neolithic revolution]], when mankind developed [[agriculture]] and gave up its [[nomad]]ic lifestyle.\n\nIt has been argued that [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] per capita was much more stable and progressed at a much slower rate until the industrial revolution and the emergence of the modern [[capitalism|capitalist]] economy, and that it has since increased rapidly in capitalist countries.\n\n[[File:Alexanderplatz Berlin 1848.jpg|left|thumb|[[Revolutions of 1848|German Revolution]], Berlin 1848]]\nThe [[Revolutions of 1848|European Revolutions of 1848]], known in some countries as the Spring of Nations or the Year of Revolution, were a series of political upheavals throughout the European continent. Described as a revolutionary wave, the period of unrest began in France and then, further propelled by the French Revolution of 1848, soon spread to the rest of Europe. Although most of the revolutions were quickly put down, there was a significant amount of violence in many areas, with tens of thousands of people tortured and killed. While the immediate political effects of the revolutions were reversed, the long-term reverberations of the events were far-reaching.\n\nIndustrial age [[reform movement]]s began the gradual change of society rather than with episodes of rapid fundamental changes. The reformists' ideas were often grounded in liberalism, although they also possessed aspects of utopian, socialist or religious concepts. The Radical movement campaigned for electoral reform, a reform of the Poor Laws, free trade, educational reform, postal reform, prison reform, and public sanitation.\n\nFollowing the Enlightenment's ideas, the reformers looked to the [[Scientific Revolution]] and industrial progress to solve the social problems which arose with the Industrial Revolution. Newton's natural philosophy combined a mathematics of axiomatic proof with the mechanics of physical observation, yielding a coherent system of verifiable predictions and replacing a previous reliance on revelation and inspired truth. Applied to public life, this approach yielded several successful campaigns for changes in social policy.\n\n[[File:Russian Peasant Girls-retouched.jpg|thumb|Russian Peasant Girls, 1900]]\nUnder [[Peter the Great]], Russia was proclaimed an Empire in 1721 and became recognized as a world power. Ruling from 1682 to 1725, Peter defeated Sweden in the [[Great Northern War]], forcing it to cede West [[Karelia]] and [[Ingria]] (two regions lost by Russia in the [[Time of Troubles]]), as well as [[Governorate of Estonia|Estland]] and [[Livland]], securing Russia's access to the sea and sea trade. On the [[Baltic Sea]] Peter founded a new capital called [[Saint Petersburg]], later known as Russia's \"Window to Europe\". [[Peter the Great's reforms]] brought considerable Western European cultural influences to Russia. [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] (\"the Great\"), who ruled in 1762–96, extended Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the [[Partitions of Poland]], pushing the Russian frontier westward and southward. Russia would [[Russian conquest of Siberia|colonize]] the vast Asian lands of [[Siberia]] expanding by land to the Pacific Coast of Asia, and [[Russian America|North America]]. As the large realm embraced [[Absolute monarchy|Absolute Monarchy]] Russia remained more conservative than its western neighbors. In the 19th century, Russia was invaded by France in 1812 but emerged as a more powerful superpower afterwards. Nonetheless industrialization did not come to Russia until the 1870s. The Medieval practice of serfdom was [[Emancipation reform of 1861|abolished]] in 1861 freeing over thirty million Russian peasants. A market economy finally emerged in the Russian Empire. However class warfare rose, and the nation was vulnerable due to rivalries with the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]].\n\nHistorians define the 19th century [[List of time periods|historical era]] as stretching from 1815 (the [[Congress of Vienna]]) to 1914 (the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]]). Alternatively, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] defined the [[The long 19th century|\"Long Nineteenth Century\"]] as spanning the years 1789 to 1914.\n\n[[File:World heads of state in 1889.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|alt=Painting of a group of standing and seated heads of state in a variety of national uniforms and formal dress|\"The World's Sovereigns\", 1889]]\n\nIn the 1800s and early 1900s, once great and powerful Empires such as Spain, Ottoman Turkey, the Mughal Empire, and the Kingdom of Portugal began to break apart. Spain, which was at one time unrivaled in Europe, had been declining for a long time when it was crippled by Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion. Sensing the time was right, Spain's vast colonies in South America began a series of rebellions that ended with almost all of the Spanish territories gaining their independence.\n\nThe once mighty Ottoman Empire was wracked with a series of revolutions, resulting with the Ottoman's only holding a small region that surrounded the capital, Istanbul.\n\n[[File:Imperalism.xcf|left|thumb|Montage that depicts European wars of imperialism. By clockwise, wars include [[French conquest of Algeria|French Algerian War]], [[First Opium War|Opium War]], [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|Russian Conquest of Central Asia]] and [[Anglo-Zulu War|Zulu War]]]]\nThe Mughal empire, which was descended from the Mongol Khanate, was bested by the upcoming [[Maratha Confederacy]]. All was going well for the [[Maratha]]s until the British took an interest in the riches of India and the British ended up ruling not just the boundaries of Modern India, but also Pakistan, Burma, Nepal, Bangladesh and some Southern Regions of Afghanistan.\n\nThe King of Portugal's vast territory of Brazil reformed into the independent Empire of Brazil. With the defeat of Napoleonic France, Britain became undoubtedly the most powerful country in the world, and by the end of the First World War controlled a Quarter of the world's population and a third of its surface. However, the power of the British Empire did not end on land, since it had the greatest navy on the planet. Electricity, steel, and petroleum enabled Germany to become a great [[Power (international)|international power]] that raced to create empires of its own.\n\nThe [[Meiji Restoration]] was a chain of events that led to enormous changes in Japan's political and social structure that was taking a firm hold at the beginning of the [[Meiji Era]] which coincided the opening of Japan by the arrival of the [[Black Ships]] of [[Commodore (USN)|Commodore]] [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]] and made [[Imperial Japan]] a [[great power]]. [[Imperial Russia|Russia]] and [[Qing Dynasty]] China failed to keep pace with the other world powers which led to massive social unrest in both empires. The Qing Dynasty's military power weakened during the 19th century, and faced with international pressure, massive [[rebellion]]s and defeats in wars, the dynasty declined after the mid-19th century.\n\nEuropean powers controlled parts of Oceania, with French [[New Caledonia]] from 1853 and [[French Polynesia]] from 1889; the Germans established colonies in [[German New Guinea|New Guinea]] in 1884, and [[German Samoa|Samoa]] in 1900. The United States expanded into the Pacific with Hawaii becoming a [[Territory of Hawaii|U.S. territory]] from 1898. Disagreements between the US, Germany and UK over Samoa led to the [[Tripartite Convention (1899)|Tripartite Convention of 1899]].\n\n[[File:British Empire 1897.jpg|thumb|The British Empire in 1897, marked in the traditional colour for imperial British dominions on maps|alt=|left]]The Victorian era of the United Kingdom was the period of [[Queen Victoria]]'s reign from June 1837 to January 1901. This was a long period of prosperity for the British people, as profits gained from the overseas British Empire, as well as from industrial improvements at home, allowed a large, educated middle class to develop. Some scholars would extend the beginning of the period—as defined by a variety of sensibilities and political games that have come to be associated with the Victorians—back five years to the passage of the [[Reform Act 1832]].\n[[File:Fleet Street. By James Valentine c.1890..jpg|alt=Fleet Street in London, 1890.|thumb|Fleet Street in London capital of the [[British Empire]], 1890]]\nIn Britain's \"imperial century\", victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than Russia in central Asia. Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the \"[[Pax Britannica]]\", and a foreign policy of \"[[splendid isolation]]\". Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many nominally independent countries, such as China, [[Argentina]] and [[Thailand|Siam]], which has been generally characterized as \"[[informal empire]]\". Of note during this time was the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], which was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the [[Zulu Empire]].\n\nBritish imperial strength was underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the Empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]]. Growing until 1922, around of territory and roughly 458 million people were added to the British Empire. The British established colonies in Australia in 1788, New Zealand in 1840 and [[Colonial Fiji|Fiji]] in 1872, with much of [[Oceania]] becoming part of the British Empire.\n\nThe [[Bourbon Restoration]] followed the ousting of Napoleon I of France in 1814. The Allies restored the Bourbon Dynasty to the French throne. The ensuing period is called the Restoration, following French usage, and is characterized by a sharp conservative reaction and the re-establishment of the Roman Catholic Church as a power in French politics. The [[July Monarchy]] was a period of liberal constitutional monarchy in France under King Louis-Philippe starting with the July Revolution (or Three Glorious Days) of 1830 and ending with the Revolution of 1848. The [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] was the Imperial Bonapartist regime of Napoleon III from 1852 to 1870, between the Second Republic and the Third Republic, in France.\n\n[[File:BismarckundNapoleonIII.jpg|left|thumb|[[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] and [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] after the [[Battle of Sedan]]]]\nThe [[Franco-Prussian War]] was a conflict between France and Prussia, while Prussia was backed up by the North German Confederation, of which it was a member, and the South German states of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria. The complete Prussian and German victory brought about the final unification of Germany under King Wilhelm I of Prussia. It also marked the downfall of Napoleon III and the end of the Second French Empire, which was replaced by the Third Republic. As part of the settlement, almost all of the territory of Alsace-Lorraine was taken by Prussia to become a part of Germany, which it would retain until the end of World War I.\n\nThe [[French Third Republic]] was the republican government of France between the end of the Second French Empire following the defeat of Louis-Napoléon in the Franco-Prussian war in 1870 and the Vichy Regime after the invasion of France by the German Third Reich in 1940. The Third Republic endured seventy years, making it the most long-lasting regime in France since the collapse of the Ancien Régime in the French Revolution of 1789.\n\n[[File:Une Dame d´une Fortune Ordinaire dans son Intérieur au Milieu de ses Habitudes Journalières, by Jean-Baptiste Debret 1823.jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[Slavery]] in [[Brazil]], before 1823]]\n\n[[Slavery]] was greatly reduced around the world in the 19th century. Following a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt in Haiti]], Britain forced the [[Barbary pirates]] to halt their practice of kidnapping and enslaving Europeans, [[Slavery Abolition Act|banned slavery throughout its domain]], and charged its navy with ending the global [[slave trade]]. Slavery was then abolished in [[Emancipation reform of 1861 in Russia|Russia]], [[Emancipation Proclamation|America]], and [[Lei Áurea|Brazil]].\n\nFollowing the abolition of the slave trade in 1807 and propelled by economic exploitation, the [[Scramble for Africa]] was initiated formally at the [[Berlin West Africa Conference]] in 1884–1885. The Berlin Conference attempted to avoid war among the European powers by allowing the European rival countries to carve up the continent of Africa into national colonies. Africans were not consulted.\n\nThe major European powers laid claim to the areas of [[Africa]] where they could exhibit a sphere of influence over the area. These claims did not have to have any substantial land holdings or treaties to be legitimate. The European power that demonstrated its control over a territory accepted the mandate to rule that region as a national [[colony]]. The European nation that held the claim developed and benefited from their colony’s commercial interests without having to fear rival European competition. With the colonial claim came the underlying assumption that the European power that exerted control would use its mandate to offer protection and provide welfare for its colonial peoples, however, this principle remained more theory than practice. There were many documented instances of material and moral conditions deteriorating for native Africans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under European colonial rule, to the point where the colonial experience for them has been described as \"hell on earth.\"\n[[File:Kongokonferenz.jpg|left|thumb|European officials staking claims to [[Africa]] in the [[Congress of Berlin]] ]]\nAt the time of the [[Berlin Conference]], Africa contained one-fifth of the world’s population living in one-quarter of the world’s land area. However, from Europe's perspective, they were dividing an unknown continent. European countries established a few coastal colonies in Africa by the mid-nineteenth century, which included [[Cape Colony]] (Great Britain), [[Angola]] (Portugal), and [[Algeria]] (France), but until the late nineteenth century Europe largely traded with free African states without feeling the need for territorial possession. Until the 1880s most of Africa remained uncharted, with western maps from the period generally showing blank spaces for the continent’s interior.\n\nFrom the 1880s to 1914, the European powers expanded their control across the African continent, competing with each other for Africa’s land and resources. [[Great Britain]] controlled various colonial holdings in East Africa that spanned the length of the African continent from Egypt in the north to South Africa. The [[France|French]] gained major ground in West Africa, and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] held colonies in southern Africa. [[Germany]], [[Italy]], and [[Spain]] established a small number of colonies at various points throughout the continent, which included German East Africa (Tanganyika) and German Southwest Africa for Germany, Eritrea and Libya for Italy, and the Canary Islands and Rio de Oro in northwestern Africa for Spain. Finally, for [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold]] (ruled from 1865 to 1909), there was the large “piece of that great African cake” known as the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]], which became his personal fiefdom. By 1914, almost the entire continent was under European control. [[Liberia]], which was settled by freed American slaves in the 1820s, and Abyssinia ([[Ethiopia]]) in eastern Africa were the last remaining independent African states.\n\n[[File:View of Kobe LACMA M.91.377.8.jpg|left|thumb|Kobe Japan and its harbor, 1865. Hand colored.]] Around the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century, the [[Meiji era]] occurred during the reign of the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]]. During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This [[Japanese era name|era name]] means \"Enlightened Rule\". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The [[Ministry of War (pre-modern Japan)|hyobusho]] (war office) was replaced with a [[Imperial Japanese Army|War Department]] and a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Naval Department.]] The [[samurai]] class suffered great disappointment the following years.\n\nLaws were instituted that required every able-bodied male Japanese citizen, regardless of class, to serve a mandatory term of three years with the first reserves and two additional years with the second reserves. This action, the deathblow for the samurai warriors and their \"daimyōs\", initially met resistance from both the peasant and warrior alike. The peasant class interpreted the term for military service, ketsu-eki (\"blood tax\") literally, and attempted to avoid service by any means necessary. The Japanese government began modelling their ground forces after the French military. The French government contributed greatly to the training of Japanese officers. Many were employed at the military academy in Kyoto, and many more still were feverishly translating French field manuals for use in the Japanese ranks. Japan's modernized military gave Japan the opportunity to engage in Imperialism with its victory against the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] Japan annexed [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]], [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea]] and the Chinese province of [[Shandong|Shangdong]].\n\nAfter the death of the Meiji Emperor, the [[Emperor Taishō|Taishō Emperor]] took the throne, the[[Taishō period]] was a time of democratic reform granting democratic rights to all Japanese men. Foreigners would instrumental in aiding in Japan's modernization. A key foreign observer of the remarkable and rapid changes in [[culture of Japan|Japanese society]] in this period was [[Ernest Mason Satow]].\n\n[[File:Westward the Course of Empire.jpg|thumb|American westward expansion is idealized in [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting \"Westward the Course of Empire Takes its Way\" (1861).]]\nThe [[Antebellum Age]] was a period of increasing division in the country based on the growth of slavery in the [[Southern United States|American South]] and in the western territories of [[Kansas]] and [[Nebraska]] that eventually led to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] in 1861. The Antebellum Period is often considered to have begun with the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]] of 1854, although it may have begun as early as 1812. This period is also significant because it marked the transition of American manufacturing to the industrial revolution.\n\n\"[[Manifest destiny]]\" was the belief that the United States was destined to expand across the North American continent, from the Atlantic seaboard to the Pacific Ocean. During this time, the United States expanded to the Pacific Ocean—\"from sea to shining sea\"—largely defining the borders of the contiguous United States as they are today.\n\n[[File:Gettysburg by Britton.ogg|left|thumb|Modern recording of [[Gettysburg Address]] originally spoken by [[President of the United States|U.S President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]]]\n[[File:Thure de Thulstrup - L. Prang and Co. - Battle of Gettysburg - Restoration by Adam Cuerden 0.5.jpg|left|thumb|[[Battle of Gettysburg]] – Restoration by Adam Cuerden 0.5]]\n\nThe American Civil War began when seven [[Slave state|Southern slave states]] declared their [[secession]] from the U.S. and formed the [[Confederate States of America]], the Confederacy (four more states joinged the Confederacy later). Led by [[Jefferson Davis]], they fought against the [[Union (American Civil War)|U.S. federal government (the Union)]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]], which was supported by all the free states and the five [[Border states (American Civil War)|border slave states]] in the north.\n\nNorthern leaders agreed that victory would require more than the end of fighting. Secession and Confederate nationalism had to be totally repudiated and all forms of slavery or quasi-slavery had to be eliminated. Lincoln proved effective in mobilizing support for the war goals, raising large armies and supplying them, avoiding foreign interference, and making the end of slavery a war goal. The Confederacy had a larger area than it could defend, and it failed to keep its ports open and its rivers clear as was the case in the [[Siege of Vicksburg|Battle of Vickysburg]]. The [[Union (American Civil War)|North]] kept up the pressure as the South could barely feed and clothe its soldiers. Its soldiers, especially those in the East under the command of General [[Robert E. Lee]] proved highly resourceful until they finally were overwhelmed by Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] in 1864–65. The [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1863–77) began with the [[Emancipation Proclamation|Emancipation proclamation]] in 1863, and included freedom, full citizenship and voting rights for Southern blacks. It was followed by a reaction that left the blacks in a second class status legally, politically, socially and economically until the 1960s.\n\n[[File:Flatiron Building and Street Scene October 8th 1902 New York City.ogv|thumb|1902 New York City in early [[skyscraper]]s]]\n\nDuring the Gilded Age, there was substantial growth in population in the United States and extravagant displays of wealth and excess of America's upper-class during the post-Civil War and post-Reconstruction era, in the late 19th century. The wealth polarization derived primarily from industrial and population expansion. The businessmen of the [[Second Industrial Revolution]] created industrial towns and cities in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] with new factories, and contributed to the creation of an ethnically diverse industrial [[working class]] which produced the wealth owned by rising super-rich [[Robber baron (industrialist)|industrialists and financiers called the \"robber barons\"]]. An example is the company of [[John D. Rockefeller]], who was an important figure in shaping the new oil industry. Using highly effective tactics and aggressive practices, later widely criticized, [[Standard Oil]] absorbed or destroyed most of its competition.\n\nThe creation of a modern industrial economy took place. With the creation of a [[Infrastructure|transportation and communication infrastructure]], the [[corporation]] became the dominant form of business organization and a [[Management|managerial revolution]] transformed [[business]] operations. In 1890, [[Congress of the United States|Congress]] passed the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]—the source of all American anti-monopoly laws. The law forbade every contract, scheme, deal, or conspiracy to restrain trade, though the phrase \"restraint of trade\" remained subjective. By the beginning of the 20th century, per capita income and [[industrial production]] in the United States exceeded that of any other country except Britain. Long hours and hazardous working conditions led many workers to attempt to form [[labor union]]s despite strong opposition from industrialists and the courts. But the courts did protect the marketplace, declaring the Standard Oil group to be an \"unreasonable\" [[monopoly]] under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] in 1911. It ordered Standard to break up into 34 independent companies with different boards of directors.\n\n[[File:Liszt- au bord d une.ogg|thumb|An example of 19th century [[Classical music|Classical Music]] Liszt- au bord d une, 1855]]\n[[File:Darwin's finches by Gould.jpg|left|thumb|Charles Darwin's finches by Gould, 1882. [[Charles Darwin]] used the example of [[Darwin's finches|finches]] in the [[Galápagos Islands|Galapagos Islands]] as evidence for the [[Natural selection|Theory of Evolution]].]]\nReplacing the [[classical physics]] in use since the end of the scientific revolution, \"[[modern physics]]\" arose in the early 20th century with the advent of [[quantum physics]], substituting [[mathematical physics|mathematical studies]] for [[experimental physics|experimental studies]] and examining [[equation]]s to build a [[theoretical structure]]. The [[old quantum theory]] was a collection of results which predate modern [[quantum mechanics]], but were never complete or self-consistent. The collection of [[heuristic]] prescriptions for quantum mechanics were the first corrections to [[classical mechanics]]. Outside the realm of quantum physics, the various [[aether theories]] in classical physics, which supposed a \"[[classical elements|fifth element]]\" such as the [[Luminiferous aether]], were nullified by the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]]—an attempt to detect the motion of earth through the aether. In biology, [[Darwinism]] gained acceptance, promoting the concept of [[adaptation]] in the theory of [[natural selection]]. The fields of [[modern geology|geology]], [[modern astronomy|astronomy]] and [[modern psychology|psychology]] also made strides and gained new insights. In [[modern medicine|medicine]], there were advances in [[medical theory]] and [[medical treatment|treatments]].\n\nStarting one-hundred years before the 20th century, the [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment spiritual philosophy]] was challenged in various quarters around the 1900s. Developed from earlier [[secular]] traditions, modern [[Humanism|Humanist]] [[ethics|ethical philosophies]] affirmed the dignity and worth of all people, based on the ability to determine right and wrong by appealing to universal human qualities, particularly [[rationalism|rationality]], without resorting to the supernatural or alleged divine authority from religious texts. For [[liberal humanism|liberal humanists]] such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the universal law of [[reason]] guided the way toward total emancipation from any kind of tyranny. These ideas were challenged, for example by the [[young Marx|young Karl Marx]], who criticized the project of political emancipation (embodied in the form of [[human rights]]), asserting it to be symptomatic of the very dehumanization it was supposed to oppose. For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], humanism was nothing more than a secular version of [[theism]]. In his \"[[Genealogy of Morals]]\", he argues that human rights exist as a means for the weak to collectively constrain the strong. On this view, such rights do not facilitate emancipation of life, but rather deny it. In the 20th century, the notion that human beings are rationally autonomous was challenged by the concept that humans were driven by unconscious irrational desires.\n\n[[File:Albert Einstein 1921 by F Schmutzer.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Albert Einstein in 1921|alt=]]\n[[Sigmund Freud]] is renowned for his redefinition of [[sexual desire]] as the primary motivational energy of human life, as well as his therapeutic techniques, including the use of [[free association (psychology)|free association]], his [[transference|theory of transference]] in the therapeutic relationship, and the [[Dream interpretation|interpretation of dreams]] as sources of insight into [[unconscious desire]]s.\n\n[[Albert Einstein]] is known for his theories of [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]. He also made important contributions to [[statistical mechanics]], especially his mathematical treatment of [[Brownian motion]], his resolution of the [[Einstein solid|paradox of specific heats]], and his connection of [[Fluctuation dissipation theorem|fluctuations and dissipation]]. Despite his reservations about its interpretation, Einstein also made contributions to quantum mechanics and, indirectly, [[quantum field theory]], primarily through his theoretical studies of the [[photon]].\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, [[Social Darwinism]] was promoted and included the various ideologies based on a concept that competition among all individuals, groups, nations, or ideas was a \"natural\" framework for social evolution in human societies. In this view, society's advancement is dependent on the \"[[survival of the fittest]]\", the term was in fact coined by [[Herbert Spencer]] and referred to in \"[[The Gospel of Wealth]]\" written by [[Andrew Carnegie]].\n\n[[File:Pyramid of Capitalist System.jpg|thumb|[[Pyramid of Capitalist System]], produced in the United States|alt=|left]]\n[[Karl Marx]] summarized his approach to history and politics in the opening line of the first chapter of \"[[The Communist Manifesto]]\" (1848). He wrote:\nThe \"Manifesto\" went through a number of editions from 1872 to 1890; notable new prefaces were written by Marx and Engels for the 1872 German edition, the 1882 Russian edition, the 1883 German edition, and the 1888 English edition. In general, [[Marxism]] identified five (and one transitional) successive stages of development in Western Europe.\n\n[[File:Australia 1900.jpg|thumb|Though still tied to [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|commonwealth]] [[Australia]] achieved peaceful independence in 1901.|alt=]]\nMajor political developments saw the former [[British Empire]] lose most of its remaining political power over [[British Commonwealth|commonwealth]] countries. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Other events include the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], two world wars, and the [[Cold War]].\n\nIn 1901, the [[Federation of Australia]] was the process by which the six separate British [[self-governing colony|self-governing colonies]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] formed one nation. They kept the systems of government that they had developed as separate colonies but also would have a federal government that was responsible for matters concerning the whole nation. When the [[Constitution of Australia]] came into force, the colonies collectively became [[States and territories of Australia|states]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]].\n\n[[File:Xinhai Revolution in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|[[Xinhai Revolution]] in [[Shanghai]]; [[Chen Qimei]] organized Shanghainese civilians to start the uprising and was successful. The picture above is [[Nanjing Road]] after the uprising, hung with the [[Five Races Under One Union]] Flags then used by the revolutionaries.|alt=|left]]\nThe last days of the [[Qing dynasty]] were marked with civil unrest, [[Hundred Days' Reform|failed reforms]] and foreign invasions such as the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer rebellion]]. Responding to these civil failures and discontent, the Qing Imperial Court did attempt to reform the government in various ways, as the decision to draft a constitution in 1906, the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909, and the preparation for a national parliament in 1910. However, many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the Qing Court, and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. The failures of the Imperial Court to enact such reforming measures of political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to steer toward the road of revolution.\n\nThe assertions of Chinese philosophy began to integrate concepts of Western philosophy, as steps toward modernization. By the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, there were many calls, such as the [[May Fourth Movement]], to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China. There were attempts to incorporate [[democracy]], [[republicanism]], and [[industrialism]] into Chinese philosophy, notably by [[Sun Yat-sen]] at the beginning of the 20th century\n\nIn 1912, the Republic of China was established and Sun Yat-sen was inaugurated in [[Nanjing]] as the first [[President of the Republic of China|Provisional President]]. But power in [[Beijing]] already had passed to [[Yuan Shikai]], who had effective control of the [[Beiyang Army]], the most powerful military force in China at the time. To prevent [[civil war]] and possible foreign intervention from undermining the infant republic, leaders agreed to Army's demand that China be united under a Beijing government. On March 10, in Beijing, Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China.\n\nAfter the early 20th century revolutions, shifting alliances of [[Warlord era (China)|China's regional warlords]] waged war for control of the Beijing government. Despite the fact that various warlords gained control of the government in Beijing during the warlord era, this did not constitute a new era of control or governance, because other warlords did not acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves. These military-dominated governments were collectively known as the [[Beiyang government]]. The warlord era ended around 1927.\n\n[[File:World 1898 empires colonies territory.png|center|thumb|700x700px|The World in 1898 color coded for major empires.

The Japanese Victory shocked the world.|alt=]]\nIn 1900 the World's Population had approached approximately 1.6 billion.\nFour years into the 20th century saw the [[Russo-Japanese War]] with the [[Battle of Port Arthur]] establishing the [[Empire of Japan]] as a world power. The Russians were in constant pursuit of a [[warm water port]] on the Pacific Ocean, for their navy as well as for maritime trade. The Manchurian Campaign of the [[Russian Empire]] was fought against the Japanese over [[Manchuria]] and [[Korea]]. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] and [[Mukden]], and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the [[Yellow Sea]]. The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers. These victories, as time transpired, would dramatically transform the distribution of power in East Asia, resulting in a reassessment of Japan's recent entry onto the world stage. The embarrassing string of defeats increased Russian popular dissatisfaction with the inefficient and corrupt Tsarist government.\n\nThe [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] was a wave of mass political unrest through vast areas of the [[Russian Empire]]. Some of it was directed against the government, while some was undirected. It included [[terrorism]], worker strikes, peasant unrests, and military mutinies. It led to the establishment of the limited constitutional monarchy, the establishment of [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]], and the [[multi-party system]].\n\nIn China, the Qing Dynasty was overthrown following the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. The Xinhai Revolution began with the [[Wuchang Uprising]] on October 10, 1911 and ended with the abdication of [[Emperor Puyi]] on February 12, 1912. The primary parties to the conflict were the Imperial forces of the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1911), and the revolutionary forces of the [[Tongmenghui|Chinese Revolutionary Alliance]] (Tongmenghui).\n\n[[File:Steamship Titanic.jpg|thumb|The [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] was the largest ship constructed in its time. Deemed invincible, it was sunk by [[iceberg]]s off the coast of [[Labrador|Labrador, Canada.]] |alt=|left]]\nThe [[Edwardian era]] in the United Kingdom is the period spanning the reign of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] up to the end of the First World War, including the years surrounding the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS \"Titanic\"]]. In the early years of the period, the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa split the country into anti- and pro-war factions. The imperial policies of the Conservatives eventually proved unpopular and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1906|general election of 1906]] the Liberals won a huge landslide. The Liberal government was unable to proceed with all of its radical programme without the support of the [[House of Lords]], which was largely Conservative. Conflict between the two Houses of Parliament over the [[People's Budget]] led to a reduction in the power of the peers in 1910. The [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|general election in January that year]] returned a [[hung parliament]] with the balance of power held by [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Nationalist Party (Ireland)|Irish Nationalist]] members.\n\nThe [[causes of World War I]] included many factors, including the conflicts and antagonisms of the four decades leading up to the war. The [[Triple Entente]] was the name given to the loose alignment between the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] after the signing of the [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] in 1907. The alignment of the three powers, supplemented by various agreements with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], the United States, and [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], constituted a powerful counterweight to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]], the third having concluded an additional secret agreement with France effectively nullifying her Alliance commitments. Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and nationalism played major roles in the conflict. The immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the [[July Crisis]] of 1914, the spark (or casus belli) for which was the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] of Austria.\n\nHowever, the crisis did not exist in a void; it came after a long series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers over European and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high. The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1870. An example is the [[Baghdad Railway]] which was planned to connect the [[Ottoman Empire]] cities of [[Konya]] and [[Baghdad]] with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War. Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the [[Balkans]]. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The [[Balkan Wars]] were two wars in South-eastern Europe in 1912–1913 in the course of which the [[Balkan League]] (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.\n\n[[File:World War 1.gif|thumb|upright=3.4|center|Various periods of World War I; 1914.07.28 (Tsar Nicholas II of Russia orders a partial mobilization against Austria-Hungary), 1914.08.01 (Germany declares war on Russia), 1914.08.03 (Germany declares war on Russia's ally France), 1914.08.04 (Britain declares war on Germany), 1914.12 (British and German [[Christmas truce]]), 1915.12 (French and German Christmas truce), 1916.12 ([[Battle of Magdhaba]]), 1917.12 (British troops take Jerusalem from the Ottoman Empire), and 1918.11.11 (World War I ends: Germany signs an armistice agreement with the Allies).Allies and Central Powers in the First World War Allied powers and areas Central powers and colonies or occupied territory Neutral countries]] [[File:General gouraud french army world war i machinegun marne 1918.JPEG|thumb|French Army, 1918]]\nThe First World War began in 1914 and lasted to the final [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]] in 1918. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], led by the [[Britain in World War I|British Empire]], [[French Third Republic|France]], Russia until March 1918, Japan and the United States after 1917, defeated the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The war caused the disintegration of four empires—the Austro-Hungarian, German, Ottoman, and Russian ones—as well as radical change in the European and West Asian maps. The Allied powers before 1917 are referred to as the [[Triple Entente]], and the Central Powers are referred to as the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].\n\n[[File:Chemical Warfare in the Twentieth Century Q54781.jpg|left|thumb|[[Chemical warfare|Chemical Warfare]] was used for the first time in WWI. Soldiers used [[Gas mask|gas-masks]] to protect themselves]]Much of the fighting in World War I took place along the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], within a system of opposing manned trenches and fortifications (separated by a \"[[No man's land]]\") running from the [[North Sea]] to the border of Switzerland. On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], the vast eastern plains and limited rail network prevented a trench warfare stalemate from developing, although the scale of the conflict was just as large. Hostilities also occurred on and under the sea and—for the first time—from the air. More than 9 million soldiers died on the various battlefields, and nearly that many more in the participating countries' home fronts on account of food shortages and [[genocide]] committed under the cover of various civil wars and internal conflicts. Notably, more people died of the worldwide [[Spanish flu|influenza outbreak]] at the end of the war and shortly after than died in the hostilities. The unsanitary conditions engendered by the war, severe overcrowding in barracks, wartime propaganda interfering with public health warnings, and migration of so many soldiers around the world helped the outbreak become a [[pandemic]].\n\nUltimately, World War I created a decisive break with the old [[New World Order (political)|world order]] that had emerged after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], which was modified by the mid-19th century's nationalistic revolutions. The results of World War I would be important factors in the development of World War II approximately 20 years later. More immediate to the time, the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]] was a political event that redrew the political boundaries of West Asia. The huge conglomeration of territories and peoples formerly ruled by the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was divided into several new nations. The partitioning brought the creation of the modern [[Arab world]] and the [[Republic of Turkey]]. The [[League of Nations]] granted France mandates over [[French Mandate of Syria|Syria]] and [[French Mandate of Lebanon|Lebanon]] and granted the United Kingdom mandates over [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]] and [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Palestine]] (which was later divided into two regions: [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]]). Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] became parts of what are today [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]].\n\n[[File:Lenin.gif|thumb|Lenin]]\n\nThe Russian Revolution is the series of revolutions in Russia in 1917, which destroyed the [[Tsarist autocracy]] and led to the creation of the Soviet Union. Following the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia]], the [[Russian Provisional Government]] was established. In October 1917, a [[October Revolution|\"red\" faction revolution]] occurred in which the [[Red Guards (Russia)|Red Guard]], armed groups of workers and deserting soldiers directed by the Bolshevik Party, seized control of [[Saint Petersburg]] (then known as [[Petrograd]]) and began an immediate armed takeover of cities and villages throughout the former [[Russian Empire]].\n\nAnother action in 1917 that is of note was the armistice signed between Russia and the Central Powers at [[Brest-Litovsk]]. As a condition for peace, the treaty by the [[Central Powers]] conceded huge portions of the former Russian Empire to [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]] and the Ottoman Empire, greatly upsetting [[nationalist]]s and [[Conservatism|conservatives]]. The Bolsheviks made peace with the [[German Empire]] and the [[Central Powers]], as they had promised the Russian people prior to the Revolution. Vladimir Lenin's decision has been attributed to his sponsorship by the foreign office of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor]], offered by the latter in hopes that with a revolution, Russia would withdraw from World War I. This suspicion was bolstered by the German Foreign Ministry's sponsorship of Lenin's return to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]]. The [[Triple Entente|Western Allies]] expressed their dismay at the Bolsheviks, upset at:\n[[File:Russian civil war posters.png|left|thumb|Two contrasting visions of the [[Russian Civil War]]. To the left is propaganda from the [[White Army]], to the right is propaganda from the [[Bolsheviks]]. ]]\nIn addition, there was a concern, shared by many [[Central Powers]] as well, that the socialist revolutionary ideas would spread to the West. Hence, many of these countries expressed their support for the Whites, including the provision of troops and supplies. [[Winston Churchill]] declared that Bolshevism must be \"strangled in its cradle\".\n\nThe Russian Civil War was a multi-party war that occurred within the former [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Russian provisional government]] collapsed and the [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviets]] under the domination of the [[Bolshevik]] party assumed power, first in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd (St. Petersburg)]] and then in other places. In the wake of the [[October Revolution]], the old Russian Imperial Army had been demobilized; the volunteer-based Red Guard was the Bolsheviks' main military force, augmented by an armed military component of the [[Cheka]], the Bolshevik state security apparatus. There was an instituted mandatory conscription of the rural peasantry into the Red Army. Opposition of rural Russians to Red Army conscription units was overcome by taking hostages and shooting them when necessary in order to force compliance. Former Tsarist officers were utilized as \"military specialists\" (\"voenspetsy\"), taking their families hostage in order to ensure loyalty. At the start of the war, three-fourths of the Red Army officer corps was composed of former Tsarist officers. By its end, 83% of all Red Army divisional and corps commanders were ex-Tsarist soldiers.\n[[File:Vladivostok intervention.jpg|thumb|In the Russian Civil War, over eleven nations intervened in favor of the [[White Movement]]. Here Japanese occupy [[Vladivostok]].]]\nThe principal fighting occurred between the [[Bolshevik]] [[Red Army]] and the forces of the [[White Movement|White Army]]. Many foreign armies warred against the Red Army, notably the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|Allied Forces]], yet many volunteer foreigners fought in both sides of the Russian Civil War. Other nationalist and regional political groups also participated in the war, including the Ukrainian nationalist [[Green armies|Green Army]], the Ukrainian anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] and [[Black Guards]], and warlords such as [[Ungern von Sternberg]]. The most intense fighting took place from 1918 to 1920. Major military operations ended on 25 October 1922 when the Red Army occupied [[Vladivostok]], previously held by the [[Provisional Priamur Government]]. The last enclave of the White Forces was the [[Ayano-Maysky District]] on the Pacific coast. The majority of the fighting ended in 1920 with the defeat of General [[Pyotr Wrangel]] in the [[Crimea]], but a notable resistance in certain areas continued until 1923 (e.g., [[Kronstadt Uprising]], [[Tambov Rebellion]], [[Basmachi Revolt]], and the final resistance of the [[White movement]] in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]]).\n\nWhile the early 1920s was a time of flux for revolutionary Russia and Central Asia, the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] was proclaimed in 1922 as the successor state to the fallen [[Russian Empire]]. Revolutionary leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] died of natural causes and was succeeded by [[Joseph Stalin]].\n\nIn 1917, China declared war on Germany in the hope of recovering its lost province, then under Japanese control. The [[New Culture Movement]] occupied the period from 1917 to 1923. Chinese representatives refused to sign the [[Treaty of Versailles]], due to intense pressure from the student protesters and public opinion alike.\n[[File:Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2.jpg|left|thumb|Student Demonstrations, June 4th and 5th, 1919 2]]\n\nThe [[May Fourth Movement]] helped to rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 [[Sun Yat-sen]] had become commander-in-chief of a rival military government in [[Guangzhou]] in collaboration with southern warlords. Sun's efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were ignored, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. But for political expediency, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP).[[File:Sino-german cooperation.png|thumb|With [[Sino-German cooperation until 1941]], Chinese industry and military was improved just prior to the war against Japan.|alt=|150x150px]]\n\nIn early 1927, the Kuomintang-CCP rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the Kuomintang had decided to move the seat of the Nationalist government from Guangzhou to [[Wuhan]]. But [[Chiang Kai-shek]], whose [[Northern Expedition]] was proving successful, set his forces to destroying the Shanghai CCP apparatus and established an anti-Communist government at Nanjing in [[April 12 Incident|April 1927]].\n\nThe \"Nanjing Decade\" of 1928–37 was one of consolidation and accomplishment under the leadership of the Nationalists, with a mixed but generally positive record in the economy, social progress, development of [[democracy in China|democracy]], and cultural creativity. Some of the harsh aspects of foreign concessions and privileges in China were moderated through diplomacy.\n\n[[File:World 1920 empires colonies territory.png|center|thumb|700x700px|The world in 1920, part of the [[interwar period]].

The spirit of the Roaring Twenties was marked by a general feeling of discontinuity associated with modernity, a break with traditions. Everything seemed to be feasible through modern technology. New technologies, especially automobiles, movies and radio proliferated 'modernity' to a large part of the population. The 1920s saw the general favor of practicality, in architecture as well as in daily life. The 1920s was further distinguished by several inventions and discoveries, extensive industrial growth and the rise in consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].[[File:I Got The Ritz From The One I Love.ogg|left|thumb|\"I got the Ritz from the one I love,\" Jazz music radio broadcast 1932]]\nEurope spent these years rebuilding and coming to terms with the vast human cost of the conflict. The economy of the United States became increasingly intertwined with that of Europe. In Germany, the [[Weimar Republic]] gave way to episodes of political and economic turmoil, which culminated with the [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|German hyperinflation]] of 1923 and the failed [[Beer Hall Putsch]] of that same year. When Germany could no longer afford war payments, Wall Street invested heavily in European debts to keep the European economy afloat as a large consumer market for American mass-produced goods. By the middle of the decade, [[economic development]] soared in Europe, and the Roaring Twenties broke out in Germany, Britain and France, the second half of the decade becoming known as the \"[[Golden Twenties]]\". In France and francophone Canada, they were also called the \"années folles\" (\"Crazy Years\")., 1935. German Nazis created large public performances to earn public support.

The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] served to punctuate the end of the previous era, as \"The Great Depression\" set in. The \"Great Depression\" was a worldwide economic [[Recession|downturn]] starting in most places in 1929 and ending at different times in the 1930s or early 1940s for different countries. It was the largest and most important [[Depression (economics)|economic depression]] in the 20th century, and is used in the 21st century as an example of how far the world's economy can fall.\n\nThe depression had devastating effects in virtually every country, rich or poor. International trade plunged by half to two-thirds, as did personal income, tax revenue, prices and profits. [[Cities in the Great Depression|Cities all around the world]] were hit hard, especially those dependent on [[heavy industry]]. Construction was virtually halted in many countries. Farming and rural areas suffered as crop prices fell by roughly 60 percent. Facing plummeting demand with few alternate sources of jobs, areas dependent on [[Primary sector of economic activity|primary sector industries]] suffered the most.\nThe Great Depression ended at different times in different countries with the [[Home front during World War II|effect lasting into the next era]]. America's Great Depression ended in 1941 with America's entry into World War II. The majority of countries set up relief programs, and most underwent some sort of political upheaval, pushing them to the left or right. In some world states, the desperate citizens turned toward nationalist [[Demagogy|demagogues]]—the most infamous being [[Adolf Hitler]]—setting the stage for the next era of war. The convulsion brought on by the worldwide depression resulted in the rise of [[Nazism]]. In Asia, Japan became an ever more assertive power, especially with regards to China.\n\n[[File:Another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler.ogg|thumb|U.K Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain|Nevil Chamberline]] attempted to negotiate with [[Adolf Hitler]] as Nazi Germany practiced an expansionist policy .|alt=|left]]\nThe interwar period was also marked by a radical change in the international order, away from the [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] that had dominated pre–World War I Europe. One main institution that was meant to bring stability was the [[League of Nations]], which was created after the First World War with the intention of maintaining world security and peace and encouraging economic growth between member countries. The League was undermined by the bellicosity of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Imperial Japan]], the Soviet Union, and [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini's]] Italy, and by the non-participation of the United States, leading many to question its effectiveness and legitimacy.[[File:Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, Hebei, autumn 1937.jpg|thumb|[[Kuomintang|Nationalist Chinese]] soldiers defending at the Battle at Great Wall, Laiyuan, [[Hebei]], [[China]] autumn 1937.

The incident highlighted French and British weakness, exemplified by their reluctance to alienate Italy and lose her as their ally. The limited actions taken by the Western powers pushed Mussolini's Italy towards alliance with Hitler's Germany anyway. The Abyssinian war showed Hitler how weak the League was and encouraged the remilitarization of the Rhineland in flagrant disregard of the Treaty of Versailles. This was the first in a series of provocative acts culminating in the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the beginning of the Second World War.\n\nFew Chinese had any illusions about Japanese designs on China. Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of [[Manchuria]] in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor [[Puyi]] as head of the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]] in 1932. During the [[Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)]], the loss of Manchuria, and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy. The [[League of Nations]], established at the end of World War I, was unable to act in the face of the Japanese defiance. After 1940, conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the [[Free China (Second Sino-Japanese War)|areas not under Japanese control]]. The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations, administrative reforms, and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants—while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence.\n\n[[File:Shashin Shuho No 151.jpg|left|thumb|141x141px|Japanese poster advocating for Tripartite Pact, 1941.]]\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] had seen tensions rise between Imperial Japan and the United States; events such as the [[Panay incident]] and the [[Nanking Massacre]] turned American public opinion against Japan. With the occupation of [[French Indochina]] in the years of 1940–41, and with the continuing war in China, the United States placed embargoes on Japan of [[strategic material]]s such as scrap metal and oil, which were vitally needed for the war effort. The Japanese were faced with the option of either withdrawing from China and losing face or seizing and securing new sources of raw materials in the resource-rich, European-controlled colonies of [[South East Asia]]—specifically [[British Malaya]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]). In 1940, Imperial Japan signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy.\n\n[[File:Ww2 allied axis 1942 jun.png|center|thumb|700x700px|World War II at the height of Axis expansion (black) fighting against the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] (blue) and [[Communist International|Comintern]] (red). It is important to note that the [[Empire of Japan]] was not at war with the [[Soviet Union]] despite being part of the [[Tripartite Pact]].]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-012-0037-23A, Polen, Straßenkampf, Infanterie.jpg|left|thumb|The German [[Invasion of Poland]] in 1939 is the official start of [[World War II|WWII]]]]\n\nThe Second World War was a global military conflict that took place in 1939–1945. It was the largest and deadliest war in history, culminating in [[the Holocaust]] and ending with the dropping of the [[atom bomb]].\n\nEven though Japan had been invading in China since 1937, the conventional view is that the war began on September 1, 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]] invaded Poland, the [[Drang nach Osten]]. Within two days the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany, even though the fighting was confined to Poland. Pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-aggression [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the Soviet Union joined with Germany on September 17, 1939, to conquer Poland and to divide Eastern Europe.\nThe [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were initially made up of Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, as well as [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] countries which were controlled directly by the UK, such as the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]]. All of these countries declared war on Germany in September 1939.\n[[File:Children in the Holocaust concentration camp liberated by Red Army.jpg|alt=Holocaust Survivors, January 1945|thumb|Survivors of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] at the infamous German concentration camp of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] located in Occupied Poland. ]]\nFollowing the lull in fighting, known as the \"[[Phoney War]]\", Germany invaded western Europe in May 1940. Six weeks later, France, in the mean time attacked by Italy as well, surrendered to Germany, which then tried unsuccessfully to conquer Britain. On September 27, Germany, Italy, and Japan signed a mutual defense agreement, the [[Tripartite Pact]], and were known as the [[Axis Powers]].Nine months later, on June 22, 1941, Germany launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union, which promptly joined the Allies. Germany was now engaged in fighting a war on two fronts. This proved to be a mistake by Germany – Germany had not successfully carried out the invasion of Britain and the war turned against the Axis.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor]], bringing it too into the war on the Allied side. China also joined the Allies, as eventually did most of the rest of the world. China was in turmoil at the time, and attacked Japanese armies through guerilla-type warfare. By the beginning of 1942, the major combatants were aligned as follows: the British Commonwealth, the United States, and the Soviet Union were fighting Germany and Italy; and the British Commonwealth, China, and the United States were fighting Japan. The United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union and China were referred as a \"trusteeship of the powerful\" during the [[World War II]] and were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in [[Declaration by United Nations]] These four countries were considered as the \"[[Four Policemen]]\" or \"Four Sheriffs\" of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies power]] and primary victors of World War II. From then through August 1945, battles raged across all of Europe, in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]], across North Africa, throughout [[Southeast Asia]], throughout China, across the Pacific Ocean and in the air over Japan.\nItaly surrendered in September 1943 and was split into a northern Germany-occupied [[puppet state]] and an Allies-friendly state in the South; Germany surrendered in May 1945. Following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], [[surrender of Japan|Japan surrendered]], marking the end of the war on September 2, 1945.\n[[File:Underwater Atomic Bomb Test At Bikini Atoll.webm|alt=Atomic Bomb underwater testing, 1946|left|thumb|Atomic Bomb Test, 1946.

About 60% of all casualties were civilians, who died as a result of disease, starvation, [[genocide]] (in particular, the [[Holocaust]]), and aerial bombing. The former Soviet Union and China suffered the most casualties. Estimates place deaths in the Soviet Union at around 23 million, while China suffered about 10 million. No country lost a greater portion of its population than Poland: approximately 5.6 million, or 16%, of its pre-war population of 34.8 million died.\nThe Holocaust (which roughly means \"burnt whole\") was the deliberate and systematic murder of millions of Jews and other \"unwanted\" during World War II by the Nazi regime in Germany. Several differing views exist regarding whether it was intended to occur from the war's beginning, or if the plans for it came about later. Regardless, persecution of Jews extended well before the war even started, such as in the \"[[Kristallnacht]]\" (Night of Broken Glass). The Nazis used propaganda to great effect to stir up anti-Semitic feelings within ordinary Germans.\n\nAfter World War II, Europe was informally split into Western and Soviet [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. [[Western Europe]] later aligned as the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and [[Eastern Europe]] as the [[Warsaw Pact]]. There was a shift in power from Western Europe and the [[British Empire]] to the two new superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. These two rivals would later face off in the [[Cold War]]. In Asia, the defeat of Japan led to its [[democratization]]. [[Chinese Civil War|China's civil war]] continued through and after the war, resulting eventually in the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The former colonies of the European powers began their road to independence.\n\n[[File:The Beatles i Hötorgscity 1963.jpg|thumb|During [[Pax Americana]], the [[Popular music|popular music industry]] flourished.Pictured here is the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] Group. |alt=|200x200px]]\n\nThe mid-20th century is distinguished from most of human history in that its most significant changes were directly or indirectly economic and technological in nature. Economic development was the force behind vast changes in everyday life, to a degree which was unprecedented in human history.\n\nOver the course of the 20th century, the world's per-capita [[gross domestic product]] grew by a factor of five, much more than all earlier centuries combined (including the 19th with its Industrial Revolution). Many economists make the case that this understates the magnitude of growth, as many of the goods and services consumed at the end of the 20th century, such as improved medicine (causing world life expectancy to increase by more than two decades) and communications technologies, were not available at any price at its beginning. However, the gulf between the world's rich and poor grew wider, and the majority of the global population remained in the poor side of the divide.\n\nStill, advancing technology and medicine has had a great impact even in the [[Global South]]. Large-scale industry and more centralized [[Mass media|media]] made brutal dictatorships possible on an unprecedented scale in the middle of the century, leading to wars that were also unprecedented. However, the increased communications contributed to [[democratization]]. Technological developments included the development of airplanes and [[space exploration]], [[nuclear technology]], advancement in [[genetics]], and the dawning of the [[Information Age]].\n\nPax Americana is an appellation applied to the historical concept of relative liberal peace in the Western world, resulting from the preponderance of power enjoyed by the United States of America starting around the start of the 20th century. Although the term finds its primary utility in the latter half of the 20th century, it has been used in various places and eras. Its modern connotations concern the peace established after the end of World War II in 1945.\n\nThe Cold War began in the mid-1940s and lasted into the early 1990s. Throughout this period, the conflict was expressed through military coalitions, espionage, weapons development, invasions, propaganda, and competitive technological development. The conflict included costly defense spending, a massive [[Conventional weapon|conventional]] and [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear]] [[arms race]], and numerous [[proxy war]]s; the two [[superpower]]s never fought one another directly.\n\n[[File:NATO vs. Warsaw (1949-1990).svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|]]\nThe Soviet Union created the [[Eastern Bloc]] of countries that it occupied, annexing some as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] and maintaining others as satellite states that would later form the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The United States and various western European countries began a policy of \"[[containment]]\" of [[communism]] and forged myriad alliances to this end, including [[NATO]]. Several of these western countries also coordinated efforts regarding the rebuilding of western Europe, including western Germany, which the Soviets opposed. In other regions of the world, such as Latin America and [[Southeast Asia]], the Soviet Union fostered [[communist revolution]]ary movements, which the United States and many of its allies opposed and, in some cases, attempted to \"[[rollback|roll back]]\". Many countries were prompted to align themselves with the nations that would later form either NATO or the Warsaw Pact, though other movements would also emerge.\n[[File:US and USSR nuclear stockpiles.svg|left|thumb|US and USSR nuclear stockpiles]]\nIn China [[Mao Zedong]] (\"Máo zé dōng\") utilized [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] thought. When the [[Communist Party of China]] assumed power in 1959, previous schools of Chinese thought, excepting notably [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], were denounced as backward. Many parts of China's past were even purged during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Though initially friendly with the [[Soviet Union]] the Chinese and Soviet communists diverged in the [[Sino-Soviet split]] of 1960. Through the end of the Cold-War, China would continue on its own path from other communist countries, building better relations with the United States after 1972. China's economy would recover from the Cultural Revolution due to [[Chinese economic reform|market-oriented reforms]] led by [[Deng Xiaoping]].\n\nThe Cold War saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm. International crises arose, such as the [[Berlin Blockade]] (1948–1949), the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953), the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]], the [[Vietnam War]] (1955–1975), the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (1962), the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (1979–1989) and [[Able Archer 83|NATO exercises in November 1983]]. There were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought [[détente]]. Direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the potential for [[mutual assured destruction]] using deliverable [[nuclear weapon]]s.\n\nThe Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. The United States under President [[Ronald Reagan]] increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressure on the Soviet Union, which was already suffering from [[Brezhnev stagnation|severe economic stagnation]]. In the second half of the 1980s, newly appointed Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] introduced the \"[[perestroika]]\" and \"[[glasnost]]\" reforms. [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|The Soviet Union collapsed]] in 1991, leaving the United States as the dominant military power, though Russia retained much of the massive Soviet nuclear arsenal.\n\nIn Latin America in the 1970s, leftists acquired a significant political influence which prompted the right-wing, ecclesiastical authorities and a large portion of the individual country's upper class to support coups d'état to avoid what they perceived as a communist threat. This was further fueled by Cuban and United States intervention which led to a political polarization. Most South American countries were in some periods ruled by [[military dictatorship]]s that were supported by the United States of America. In the 1970s, the regimes of the [[Southern Cone]] collaborated in [[Operation Condor]] killing many [[leftist]] dissidents, including some [[urban guerrilla]]s. However, by the early 1990s all countries had restored their democracies.\n\n[[File:Neil Armstrong small step.wav|left|thumb|Neil Armstrong small step]]\n[[File:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|left|thumb|\"[[The Blue Marble]]\", a photograph of Earth as seen from Apollo 17. The second half of the 20th century saw an increase of interest in both [[space exploration]] and the [[environmental movement]].]]\nThe [[Space Age]] is a period encompassing the activities related to the [[Space Race]], [[space exploration]], space technology, and the cultural developments influenced by these events. The Space Age began with the development of several technologies that culminated with the launch of [[Sputnik 1]] by the Soviet Union in October 1957. This was the world's first artificial satellite, orbiting the Earth in 98.1 minutes and weighing in at 83 kg. The launch of Sputnik 1 ushered a new era of political, scientific and technological achievements that became known as the Space Age. The Space Age was characterized by rapid development of new technology in a close race mostly between the United States and the Soviet Union. The Space Age brought the first human spaceflight during the [[Vostok programme]] and reached its peak with the [[Apollo program]] which captured the imagination of much of the world's population. The landing of [[Apollo 11]] was an event watched by over 500 million people around the world and is widely recognized as one of the defining moments of the 20th century. Since then and with the end of the space race due to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], public attention has largely moved to other areas.\n\nThe [[humanities]] are academic disciplines which study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic induction|analytic]], critical, or speculative, as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social sciences]]. Although many of the subjects of modern history coincide with that of standard history, the subject is taught independently by various systems of education in the world.\n\nStudents can choose the subject at university. The material covered includes from the mid-18th century, to analysis of the present day. Virtually all colleges and sixth forms that do teach modern history do it alongside standard history; very few teach the subject exclusively.\n\nAt the [[University of Oxford]] 'Modern History' has a somewhat different meaning. The contrast is not with the Middle Ages but with Antiquity. The earliest period that can be studied in the [[Final Honour School]] of Modern History begins in 285.\n\n\n\"Books\"\n\n\"Websites\"\n\n\n\n\n\n[[Category:Modern history| ]]\n[[Category:Historical eras]]\n[[Category:Historiography]]\n[[Category:Postmodern theory]]\n[[Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines]]\n[[Category:World history]]"}
{"id": "75193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75193", "title": "Natural semantic metalanguage", "text": "Natural semantic metalanguage\n\nThe Natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) is a linguistic theory based on the conception of Polish professor Andrzej Bogusławski. The theory was formally developed by Anna Wierzbicka at Warsaw University and later at the Australian National University in the early 1970s, and Cliff Goddard at Australia's Griffith University.\n\nThe Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM) theory attempts to reduce the semantics of all lexicons down to a restricted set of semantic primitives, or primes. Primes are universal in that they have the same translation in every language, and they are primitive in that they cannot be defined using other words. Primes are ordered together to form explications, which are descriptions of semantic representations consisting solely of primes.\n\nResearch in the NSM approach deals extensively with language and cognition, and language and culture. Key areas of research include lexical semantics, grammatical semantics, phraseology and pragmatics, as well as cross-cultural communication.\n\nDozens of languages, including representatives of 16 language groups, have been studied using the NSM framework. They include English, Russian, Polish, French, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Danish, Finnish, Malay, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Ewe, Wolof, East Cree, Koromu, at least 16 Australian languages, and a number of creole languages including Trinidadian creole, Roper River Kriol, Bislama and Tok Pisin.\n\nApart from the originators Anna Wierzbicka and Cliff Goddard, several other scholars have participated in NSM semantics, most notably Bert Peeters, Zhengdao Ye, Felix Ameka, Jean Harkins, Marie-Odile Junker, Anna Gladkova, Jock Wong, Carsten Levisen, Helen Bromhead, Adrian Tien, Carol Priestley, Yuko Asano-Cavanagh and Gian Marco Farese.\n\nSemantic primes (also known as semantic primitives) are concepts that are universal and primitive. Universal indicates that they can be translated literally into any known language and retain their semantic representation. They are primitive as they are proposed to be the most simple linguistic concepts and are unable to be defined using simpler terms .\n\nProponents of the NSM theory argue that every language shares a core vocabulary of concepts. In 1994 and 2002, Goddard and Wierzbicka studied languages across the globe and found strong evidence supporting this argument.\n\nWierzbicka's 1972 study proposed 14 semantic primes. That number was expanded to 60 in 2002 by Wierzbicka and Goddard, and the current agreed-upon number is 65 .\n\nEach language's translations of the semantic primes are called exponents. Below is a list of English exponents, or the English translation of the semantic primes. It is important to note that some of the exponents in the following list are polysemous and can be associated with meanings in English (and other languages) that are not shared. However, when used as an exponent in the Natural semantic metalanguage, it is only the prime concept which is identified as universal.\n\nThe following is a list of English exponents of semantic primes adapted from Levisen and Waters (eds.) 2017.\n\nNSM primes can be combined in a limited set of syntactic frames that are also universal . These valency options specify the specific types of grammatical functions that can be combined with the primes. While these combinations can be realized differently in other languages, it is believed that the meanings expressed by these syntactic combinations are universal. \n\nExample of valency frames for SAY (from Semantic Analysis )\n\nsomeone said something→[minimal frame]\n\nsomeone said: '––'→[direct speech]\n\nsomeone said something to someone→[plus 'addressee']\n\nsomeone said something about something/someone→[plus 'locutionary topic']\n\nA semantic analysis in the NSM approach results in a reductive paraphrase called an explication that captures the meaning of the concept explicated . An ideal explication can be substituted for the original expression in context without change of meaning.\n\nE.g., \"Someone X killed someone Y\":\nsomeone X did something to someone else Y\nbecause of this, something happened to Y at the same time\nbecause of this, something happened to Y's body\nbecause of this, after this Y was not living anymore \"(archived at\" \")\"\n\nSemantic molecules are intermediary words used in explications and cultural scripts. While not semantic primes, they can be defined exclusively using primes. Semantic molecules can be determined as words that are necessary to build upon to explicate other words . These molecules are marked by the notation [m] in explications and cultural scripts. Some molecules are proposed to be universal or near-universal, while others are culture or area specific. \n\nExamples of proposed universal molecules:\nMinimal English is a new derivative of the Natural semantic metalanguage research, with the first major publication in 2018 . It is a reduced form of English designed for non-specialists to use when requiring clarity of expression or easily translatable materials. Minimal English uses an expanded set of vocabulary to the semantic primes. It includes the proposed universal and near-universal molecules, as well as non-universal words which can assist in clarity . As such, it already has counterparts targeted at speakers of other natural languages, e.g. Minimal French, Minimal Polish, 65 Sanaa (\"Minimal Finnish\") and so on. Minimal English differs from other simple Englishes (such as Basic English) as it has been specifically designed for maximal cross-translatability.\n\n\n\n"}

Wittgenstein suggested that a meaningful proposition pictured a state of affairs or atomic fact. Wittgenstein compared the concept of logical pictures (German \"Bild\") with spatial pictures. The picture theory of language is considered a correspondence theory of truth.\n\nWittgenstein claims there is an unbridgeable gap between what can be expressed in language and what can only be expressed in non-verbal ways. Picture theory of language states that statements are meaningful if they can be defined or pictured in the real world.\n\nWittgenstein's later practice-based theory of meaning laid out in the First Part of \"Philosophical Investigations\" refuted and replaced his earlier picture-based theory with a use theory of meaning.

{"id": "1159588", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1159588", "title": "Productive forces", "text": "Productive forces\n\n\"Productive forces\", \"productive powers\", or \"forces of production\" (in German, \"Produktivkräfte\"), is a central idea in Marxism and historical materialism.\n\nIn Karl Marx and Frederick Engels's own critique of political economy, it refers to the combination of the means of labor (tools, machinery, land, infrastructure, and so on) with human labour power. Marx and Engels probably derived the concept from Adam Smith's reference to the \"productive powers of labour\" (see e.g. chapter 8 of \"The Wealth of Nations\"), although the German political economist Friedrich List also mentions the concept of \"productive powers\" in \"The National System of Political Economy\" (1841).\n\nAll those forces which are applied by people in the production process (body and brain, tools and techniques, materials, resources, quality of workers' cooperation, and equipment) are encompassed by this concept, including those management and engineering functions technically indispensable for production (as contrasted with social control functions). Human knowledge can also be a productive force.\n\nTogether with the social and technical relations of production, the productive forces constitute a historically specific mode of production.\n\nKarl Marx emphasized that, with few exceptions, means of labour are not a productive force unless they are actually operated, maintained and conserved by living human labour. Without applying living human labour, their physical condition and value would deteriorate, depreciate, or be destroyed (an example would be a ghost town or capital depreciation due to strike action).\n\nCapital itself, being one of the factors of production, comes to be viewed in capitalist society as a productive force in its own right, independent from labour, a subject with \"a life of its own\". Indeed, Marx sees the essence of what he calls \"the capital relation\" as being summarised by the circumstance that \"capital buys labour\", i.e. the power of property ownership to command human energy and labour-time, and thus of inanimate \"things\" to exert an autonomous power over people. What disappears from view is that the power of capital depends in the last instance on human cooperation.\n\nThe productive power of cooperation comes to be viewed as the productive power of capital, because it is capital which forcibly organises people, rather than people organising capital. Marx regarded this as a supreme reification.\n\nUnlike British classical economics, Marxian economics classifies financial capital as being an element of the relations of production, rather than the factors or forces of production (\"not a thing, but a social relation between persons, established by the instrumentality of things\").\n\nMarx & Engels did not believe that human history featured a continuous growth of the productive forces. Rather, the development of the productive forces was characterised by social conflicts. Some productive forces destroyed other productive forces, sometimes productive techniques were lost or destroyed, and sometimes productive forces could be turned into destructive forces:\n\nThe Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., textbook (1957, p xiv) says that \"[t]he productive forces reflect the \"relationship\" of people to the objects and forces of nature used for the production of material wealth.\" (italics added) While productive forces are a \"human\" activity, the concept of \"productive forces\" includes the concept that technology mediates the human-nature relationship. Productive forces do \"not\" include the subject of labor (the raw materials or materials from nature being worked on). Productive forces are not the same thing as the means of production. Marx identified three components of production: human labor, subject of labor, and means of labor (1967, p 174). Productive forces are the union of human labor and the means of labor; \"means of production\" are the union of the subject of labor and the means of labor. (Institute of Economics of the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R., 1957, p xiii).\n\nOn the other hand, The Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1969-1978) states:\nAccording to this, productive forces have such structure:\n\nMarxism in USSR served as core philosophical paradigm or platform, and had been developing as a science. So different views, hypotheses and approaches were widely discussed, tested and refined with time.\n\nOther interpretations, sometimes influenced by postmodernism and the concept of commodity fetishism have by contrast emphasized the reification of the powers of technology, said to occur by the separation of technique from the producers, and by falsely imputing human powers to technology as autonomous force, the effect being a perspective of inevitable and unstoppable technological progress operating beyond any human control, and impervious to human choices.\n\nIn turn, this is said to have the effect of naturalising and legitimating social arrangements produced by people, by asserting that they are technically inevitable. The error here seems to be that social relations between people are confused and conflated with technical relations between people and things, and object relations between things; but this error is said to be a spontaneous result of the operation of a universal market and the process of commercialization.\n\nMarx's concept of productive forces also has some relevance for discussions in economics about the meaning and measurement of productivity.\n\nModern economics theorises productivity in terms of the marginal product of the factors of production. Marx theorises productivity within the capitalist mode of production in terms of the social and technical relations of production, with the concept of the organic composition of capital and the value product. He suggests there is no completely neutral view of productivity possible; how productivity is defined depends on the values and interests people have. Thus, different social classes have different notions of productivity reflecting their own station in life, and giving rise to different notions of productive and unproductive labour.\n\nIn the romantic or ecological critique of technology, technical progress boosting productivity often does not mean human progress at all. The design of production technologies may not be suited to human needs or human health, or technologies may be used in ways which do more harm than good. In that case, productive forces are transformed into destructive forces.\n\nSometimes this view leads to cultural pessimism or a theory of \"Small is beautiful\" as proposed by E. F. Schumacher. Ideas about alternative technology are also proposed. All of this suggests that the technologies we have, are only \"options\" which have been chosen from different technical possibilities existing at the time, and that the same technologies can be used for good or for ill, in different contexts.\n\nA technology may be chosen because it is profitable, and once adopted on a mass scale, it may be difficult to create alternatives to it, particularly because it becomes integrated with other technologies and a whole \"life style\" (e.g. petrol-fueled cars). Yet that may not mean that the technology is ultimately desirable for human life on earth.\n\nProductive force determinism is then criticised on the ground that whatever technologies are adopted, these are the result of human choices between technical alternatives, influenced by the human interests and stakes existing at the time. What may be presented as a pre-determined \"technical necessity\" may in reality have more to do with considerations of political, sociological, or economic power.\n\nAdvocates of technological progress however argue that even if admittedly \"progress may have its price\", without technical innovation there would be no progress at all; the same people who criticize technology also depend on it for their everyday existence.\n\n"}

An inverted replica complements the original by filling its gaps. It can be a copy used for historical purposes, such as being placed in a museum. Sometimes the original never existed. Replicas and reproductions can be related to any form of licensing an image for others to use, whether it is through photos, postcards, prints, miniature or full size copies they represent a resemblance of the original object.\n\n\"Not all incorrectly attributed items are intentional forgeries. In the same way that a museum shop might sell a print of a painting or a replica of a vase, copies of statues, paintings, and other precious artifacts have been popular through the ages.\n\nHowever, replicas have often been used illegally for forgery and counterfeits, especially of money and coins, but also commercial merchandise such as designer label clothing, luxury bags and accessories, and luxury watches. In arts or collectible automobiles, the term \"replica\" is used for discussing the non-original recreation, sometimes hiding its real identity.\n\nIn motor racing, especially motorcycling, often manufacturers will produce a street version product with the colours of the vehicle or clothing of a famous racer. This is not the actual vehicle or clothing worn during the race by the racer, but a fully officially approved brand-new street-legal product in similar looks. Typically found in helmets, race suits/clothing, and motorcycles, they are coloured in the style of racers, and often carry the highest performance and safety specifications of any street-legal products. These high-performance race-look products termed \"Replica\", are priced higher and are usually more sought-after than plain colours of the same product.\n\nBecause of gun ownership restrictions in some locales, gun collectors create non-functional legal replicas of illegal firearms. Such replicas are also preferred to real firearms when used as a prop in a film or stage performance, generally for safety reasons.\n\nA prop replica is an authentic-looking duplicate of a prop from a video game, movie or television show.\n\n\"Replicas represent a copy or forgery of another object and we often think of forgeries we think of paintings but, in fact, anything that is collectible and expensive is an attractive item to forge\".\n\nReplicas have been made by people to preserve a perceived link to the past. This can be linked to a historical past or specific time-period or just to commemorate an experience. Replicas and reproductions of artifacts help provide a material representation of the past for the public. \n\nReplicas of artifacts and art have a purpose within museums and research. They are created to help with preserving of original artifacts. In many cases the original artifact may be too frail and be to much at risk of further damage on display posing a risk to the artifact from light damage, environmental agents, and other risks greater than in secure storage.\n\nReplicas are created for the purpose of experimental archaeology where archaeologists and material analysts try to understand the ways that an artifact was created and what technologies and skills were needed for the people to create the artifact on display.\n\nAnother reason for the creation of replica artifacts, is for museums to be able to send originals around the globe or allow other museums or events to educate people on the history of specific artifacts. Replicas are also put on display in museums when further research is being conducted on the artifact, but further display of the artifact in real or replica form is important for public access and knowledge.\n\nReplicas and their original representation can be seen as fake or real depending on the viewer. Good replicas take much education related to understanding all the processes and history that go behind the culture and the original creation. To create a good and authentic replica of an object, there is to be a skilled artisan or forger to create the same authentic experience that the original object provides. This process takes time and much money to be done correctly for museum standards.\n\nAuthenticity or real feeling presented by an object can be “described as the experience of an ‘aura’ of an original.” An aura of an object is what an object represents through its previous history and experience.\n\nReplicas work well in museum settings because they have the ability to look so real and accurate that people can feel the authentic feelings that they are supposed to get from the originals. Through the context and experience that a replica can provide in a museum setting, people can be fooled into seeing it as ‘original’.\n\nThe authenticity of a replica is important for the impression it gives off to tourists or observers. \n“According to Trilling, the original use of authenticity in tourism was in museums where experts wanted to determine 'whether objects of art are what they appear to be or are claimed to be, and therefore worth the price that is asked for them or…. worth the admiration they are being given'.”\n\nThese reproductions and the values of authenticity presented to the public through artifacts in museums provide “truth”. However, authenticity has a way of also being represented in what the public expects in a predictable manner or based on stereotypes within museums. This idea of authenticity also relates to cultural artifacts like food, cultural activities, festivals, housing, and dress that helps to homogenize the cultures that are being represented and make them seem static.\n\nFor luxury goods, the same authentic feel has to be present for consumers to want to buy a “fake” designer bag or watch that provides them with the same feelings and desired experiences, but as well achieves the look of higher class.\n\nReplicas and reproductions are also for purely consumption and personal value. Through souvenirs people can own their very own physical representation of their experience or passions. \nPeople can buy on-line full size replicas (museum-quality) of the Rosetta Stone or prints and museum-quality copies of the Mona Lisa and other famous pieces of art.\n\nFor example, Difference Engine No. 2, designed by Charles Babbage in the 19th century, was reconstructed from original drawings studied by Allan Bromley in the 1980s and is now on display at the Science Museum in London, England. A second example is Stephenson's Rocket where a replica was built in 1979, following the original design fairly closely, but with some adaptations.\n\nIn China the terra-cotta warriors can be recreated to be personalized for customers. The “Talented craftspeople use their hands and proper tools reproducing every masterwork precisely in the same manner as the royal craftsmen did 2200 years ago. They are made from the same local clay as the originals and constructed essentially in the same ancient method.” These warriors can come in a variety of sizes and provide a very realistic and authentic experience with their own personal warrior.\n\nAs the white mark prestige comes from the imitation of iPhone, the white marks are the most popular brands in the world. Knock-off brand label fashions and accessories like Louis Vuitton, Coach, Chanel, and Rolex are major labels that get copied.\n\nControversies with replicas (museum context) are associated with who owns the past.\n\nWith works of art museums assert their intellectual property rights for replicas and reproduction of images which many museums use commercial licensing for providing access to images. Issues are arising with more images being available on the internet and it being free access.\n\nArtists can claim copyright infringement related to displays of their work in a context they did not approve of which can be the creation of replicas of their pieces.\n\nWith replica artifacts the copies to be “museum-quality” have to reach a high standard and can cost a lot of money to be produced.\n\nReplica artifacts (copies) can provide an authentic view but represents more of the subjectivities of what people expect and desire from their museum experiences and the cultures they learn about.\n\nWith copies of retail and other counterfeit goods there is a legal issue related to copyright and trademark ownership.\n\n"}

{"id": "2212880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2212880", "title": "Selenography", "text": "Selenography\n\nSelenography is the study of the surface and physical features of the Moon. Historically, the principal concern of selenographists was the mapping and naming of the lunar maria, craters, mountain ranges, and other various features. This task was largely finished when high resolution images of the near and far sides of the Moon were obtained by orbiting spacecraft during the early space era. Nevertheless, some regions of the Moon remain poorly imaged (especially near the poles) and the exact locations of many features (like crater depths) are uncertain by several kilometers. Today, selenography is considered to be a subdiscipline of selenology, which itself is most often referred to as simply \"lunar science.\" The word selenography is derived from the Greek lunar deity Σελήνη \"Selene\" and γράφω graphō, \"I write\".\n\nThe idea that the Moon is not perfectly smooth originates to at least \"circa\" 450 BC, when Democritus asserted that the Moon's \"lofty mountains and hollow valleys\" were the cause of its markings. However, not until the end of the 15th century AD did serious study of selenography began. \"Circa\" AD 1603, William Gilbert made the first lunar drawing based on naked-eye observation. Others soon followed, and when the telescope was invented, initial drawings of poor accuracy were made, but soon thereafter improved in tandem with optics. In the early 18th century, the librations of the Moon were measured, which revealed that more than half of the lunar surface was visible to observers on Earth. In 1750, Johann Meyer produced the first reliable set of lunar coordinates that permitted astronomers to locate lunar features. \n\nLunar mapping became systematic in 1779 when Johann Schröter began meticulous observation and measurement of lunar topography. In 1834 Johann Heinrich von Mädler published the first large cartograph (map) of the Moon, comprising 4 sheets in size, and he subsequently published \"The Universal Selenography\". All lunar measurement was based on direct observation until March 1840, when J.W. Draper, using a 5 inch reflector, produced a daguerreotype of the Moon and thus introduced photography to astronomy. At first, the images were of very poor quality, but as with the telescope 200 years earlier, their quality rapidly improved. By 1890 lunar photography had become a recognized subdiscipline of astronomy.\n\nThe 20th century witnessed more advances in selenography. In 1959, the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3 transmitted the first photographs of the far side of the Moon, giving the first view of it in history. The United States of America launched the Ranger spacecraft between 1961 and 1965 to photograph the lunar surface until the instant they impacted it, the Lunar Orbiters between 1966 and 1967 to photograph the Moon from orbit, and the Surveyors between 1966 and 1968 to photograph and softly land on the lunar surface. The Soviet Lunokhods 1 (1970) and 2 (1973) traversed almost 50 km of the lunar surface, making detailed photographs of the lunar surface. The Clementine spacecraft obtained the first nearly global cartograph (map) of the lunar topography, and also multispectral images. Successive missions transmitted photographs of increasing resolution.\n\nThe oldest known illustration of the Moon was found in a passage grave in Knowth, County Meath, Ireland. The tomb was carbon dated to 3330–2790 BC. Leonardo da Vinci made and annotated some sketches of the Moon in \"circa\" 1500. William Gilbert made a drawing of the Moon in which he denominated a dozen surface features in the late 16th century; it was published posthumously In \"De Mondo Nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova\". After the invention of the telescope, Thomas Harriot (1609), Galileo Galilei (1609), and Charles Scheiner (1614) made drawings also.\n\nThe first serious denominations of the surface features of the Moon, based on telescopic observation, were made by Michel Florent van Langren in 1645. His work is considered the first true cartograph (map) of the Moon because it demarcated the various lunar maria, craters, and mountains and ranges. Many of his denominations were distinctly Catholic, denominating craters in honor of Catholic royalty and capes and promontories in honor of Catholic saints. The lunar \"maria\" were denominated in Latin for terrestrial seas and oceans. Minor craters were denominated in honor of astronomers, mathematicians, and other famous scholars.\n\nIn 1647, Johannes Hevelius produced the rival work \"Selenographia\", which was the first lunar atlas. Hevelius ignored the nomenclature of Van Langren and instead denominated the lunar topography according to terrestrial features, such that the names of lunar features corresponded to the toponyms of their geographical terrestrial counterparts, especially as the latter were denominated by the ancient Roman and Greek civilizations. This work of Hevelius influenced his contemporary European astronomers, and the \"Selenographia\" was the standard reference on selenography for over a century.\n\nGiambattista Riccioli, SJ, a Catholic priest and scholar who lived in northern Italy authored the present scheme of Latin lunar nomenclature. His \"Almagestum Novum\" was published in 1651 as a defense of the Catholic views of the Counter Reformation. In particular he argued against the views espoused by Galileo and Copernicus of a heliocentric universe with perfectly circular orbits. \"Almagestum Novum\" contained scientific reference matter based on contemporary knowledge, and contemporary Jesuit educators widely used it. However, the only significant component of the work that is presently authoritative is his system of lunar nomenclature.\n\nThe lunar illustrations in the \"Almagestum Novum\" were drawn by a fellow Jesuit educator named Francesco Grimaldi, SJ. The nomenclature was based on a subdivision of the visible lunar surface into octants that were numbered in Roman style from I to VIII. Octant I referenced the northwest section and subsequent octants proceeded clockwise in alignment with compass directions. Thus Octant VI was to the south and included Clavius and Tycho Craters.\n\nThe Latin nomenclature had 2 components: the first denominated the broad features of \"terrae\" (lands) and \"maria\" (seas) and the second denominated the craters. Riccioli authored lunar toponyms derived from the names of various conditions, including climactic ones, whose causes were historically attributed to the Moon. Thus there were the seas of crises (\"Mare Crisium\"), serenity (\"Mare Serenitatis\"), and fertility (\"Mare Fecunditatis\"). There were also the seas of rain (\"Mare Imbrium\"), clouds (\"Mare Nubium\"), and cold (\"Mare Frigoris\"). The topographical features between the \"maria\" were comparably denominated, but were opposite the toponyms of the \"maria\". Thus there were the lands of sterility (\"Terra Sterilitatis\"), heat (\"Terra Caloris\"), and life (\"Terra Vitae\"). However, these names for the highland regions were supplanted on later cartographs (maps). See List of features on the Moon#Terra for a complete list.\nMany of the craters were denominated topically pursuant to the octant in which they were located. Craters in Octants I, II, and III were primarily denominated based on names from ancient Greece, such as Plato, Atlas, and Archimedes. Toward the middle in Octants IV, V, and VI craters were denominated based on names from the ancient Roman Empire, such as Julius Caesar, Tacitus, and Taruntius. Toward the southern half of the lunar cartograph (map) craters were denominated in honor of scholars, writers, and philosophers of medieval Europe and Arabic regions. The outer extremes of Octants V, VI, and VII, and all of Octant VIII were denominated in honor of contemporaries of Giambattista Riccioli. Features of Octant VIII were also denominated in honor of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. These persons were \"banished\" to it far from the \"ancients\", as a gesture to the Catholic Church. Many craters around the Mare Nectaris were denominated in honor of Catholic saints pursuant to the nomenclature of Van Langren. All of them were, however, connected in some mode with astronomy. Later cartographs (maps) removed the \"St.\" from their toponyms.\n\nThe lunar nomenclature of Giambattista Riccioli was widely used after the publication of his \"Almagestum Novum\", and many of its toponyms are presently used. The system was scientifically inclusive and was considered eloquent and poetic in style, and therefore it appealed widely to his contemporaries. It was also readily extensible with new toponyms for additional features. Thus it replaced the nomenclature of Van Langren and Hevelius.\n\nLater astronomers and lunar cartographers augmented the nomenclature with additional toponyms. The most notable among these contributors was Johann H. Schröter, who published a very detailed cartograph (map) of the Moon in 1791 titled the \"Selenotopografisches Fragmenten\". Schröter's adoption of Riccioli's nomenclature perpetuated it as the universally standard lunar nomenclature. A vote of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1935 established the lunar nomenclature of Riccioli, which included 600 lunar toponyms, as universally official and doctrinal.\n\nThe IAU later expanded and updated the lunar nomenclature in the 1960s, but new toponyms were limited to toponyms honoring deceased scientists. After Soviet spacecraft photographed the far side of the Moon, many of the newly discovered features were denominated in honor of Soviet scientists and engineers. The IAU assigned all subsequent new lunar toponyms. Some craters were denominated in honor of space explorers.\n\nJohann H. Mädler authored the nomenclature for satellite craters. The subsidiary craters surrounding a major crater were identified by a letter. These subsidiary craters were usually smaller than the crater with which they were associated, with some exceptions. The craters could be assigned letters \"A\" through \"Z\", with \"I\" omitted. Because the great majority of the toponyms of craters were masculine, the major craters were generically denominated \"patronymic\" craters.\n\nThe assignment of the letters to satellite craters was originally somewhat haphazard. Letters were typically assigned to craters in by order of significance rather than location. Precedence depended on the angle of illumination from the Sun at the time of the telescopic observation, which could change during the lunar day. In many cases the assignments were seemingly random. In a number of cases the satellite crater was located closer to a major crater with which it was not associated. To identify the patronymic crater, Mädler placed the identifying letter to the side of the midpoint of the feature that was closest to the associated major crater. This also had the advantage of permitting omission of the toponyms of the major craters from the cartographs (maps) when their subsidiary features were labelled.\n\nOver time, lunar observers assigned many of the satellite craters an eponym. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) assumed authority to denominate lunar features in 1919. The commission for denominating these features formally adopted the convention of using capital Roman letters to identify craters and valleys.\n\nWhen suitable cartographs (maps) of the far side of the Moon became available by 1966, Ewen A. Whitaker denominated satellite features based on the angle of their location relative to the major crater with which they were associated. A satellite crater located due north of the major crater was identified as \"Z\". The full 360° circle around the major crater was then subdivided evenly into 24 parts, like a 24-hour clock. Each \"hour\" angle, running clockwise, was assigned a letter, beginning with \"A\" at 1 o'clock. The letters \"I\" and \"O\" were omitted, resulting in only 24 letters. Thus a crater due south of its major crater was identified as \"M\".\n\nThe following is a list of historically-notable lunar\nmaps and atlases, arranged in chronological order by\npublication date.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "43795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43795", "title": "Stone of Scone", "text": "Stone of Scone\n\nThe Stone of Scone (; , )—also known as the Stone of Destiny, and often referred to in England as The Coronation Stone—is an oblong block of red sandstone that was used for centuries in the coronation of the monarchs of Scotland, and later the monarchs of England and those of the United Kingdom. Historically, the artefact was kept at the now-ruined Scone Abbey in Scone, near Perth, Scotland. It is also known as Jacob's Pillow Stone and the Tanist Stone, and in Scottish Gaelic, \"clach-na-cinneamhain\". Its size is approximately by by and its weight is approximately . A roughly incised cross is on one surface, and an iron ring at each end aids with transport. The Stone of Scone was last used in 1953 for the coronation of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the 14th century, the English cleric and historian Walter Hemingford described the previous location of the Scottish coronation stone as the monastery of Scone, 3km north of Perth:\nVarious theories and legends exist about the stone's history prior to its placement in Scone:\n\n\nGeologists proved that the stone taken by Edward I of England to Westminster is a \"lower Old Red Sandstone\", which was quarried in the vicinity of Scone. Doubts over the authenticity of the stone have existed for a long time: a blog post by retired Scottish academic and writer of historical fiction Marie MacPherson shows that they date back at least two hundred years.\n\nA letter to the editor of the \"Morning Chronicle\", dated 2 January 1819, states:\nOn the 19th of November, as the servants belonging to the West Mains of Dunsinane-house, were employed in carrying away stones from the excavation made among the ruins that point out the site of Macbeth's castle here, part of the ground they stood on suddenly gave way, and sank down about six feet, discovering a regularly built vault, about six feet long and four wide. None of the men being injured, curiosity induced them to clear out the subterranean recess, when they discovered among the ruins a large stone, weighing about 500lb [], which is pronounced to be of the meteoric or semi-metallic kind. This stone must have lain here during the long series of ages since Macbeth's reign. Beside it were also found two round tablets, of a composition resembling bronze. On one of these two lines are engraved, which a gentleman has thus deciphered.— 'The sconce (or shadow) of kingdom come, until Sylphs in air carry me again to Bethel.' These plates exhibit the figures of targets for the arms. From time immemorial it has been believed among us here, that unseen hands brought Jacob's pillow from Bethel and dropped it on the site where the palace of Scoon now stands. A strong belief is also entertained by many in this part of the country that it was only a representation of this Jacob's pillow that Edward sent to Westminster, the sacred stone not having been found by him. The curious here, aware of such traditions, and who have viewed these venerable remains of antiquity, agree that Macbeth may, or rather must, have deposited the stone in question at the bottom of his Castle, on the hill of Dunsinane (from the trouble of the times), where it has been found by the workmen. This curious stone has been shipped for London for the inspection of the scientific amateur, in order to discover its real quality.\n\nIn 1296, the stone was captured by Edward I as spoils of war and taken to Westminster Abbey, where it was fitted into a wooden chair—known as King Edward's Chair—on which most subsequent English and then British sovereigns have been crowned. Edward I sought to claim his status as the \"Lord Paramount\" of Scotland, with the right to oversee its King.\n\nSome doubt exists over the stone captured by Edward I. The Westminster Stone theory posits that the monks at Scone Palace hid the real stone in the River Tay, or buried it on Dunsinane Hill, and that the English troops were tricked into taking a substitute. Some proponents of the theory claim that historic descriptions of the stone do not match the present stone.\n\nIn The Treaty of Northampton 1328, between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England, England agreed to return the captured stone to Scotland; riotous crowds prevented it from being removed from Westminster Abbey. The stone remained in England for another six centuries, even after James VI of Scotland assumed the English throne as James I of England. For the next century, the Stuart kings and queens of Scotland once again sat on the stone but at their coronation as kings and queens of England.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1950, a group of four Scottish students (Ian Hamilton, Gavin Vernon, Kay Matheson, and Alan Stuart) removed the stone from Westminster Abbey for return to Scotland. During the removal process, the stone broke into two pieces. After burying the greater part of the Stone in a Kent field, where they camped for a few days, they uncovered the buried stone and returned to Scotland, along with a new accomplice, John Josselyn. According to one US diplomat who was posted in Edinburgh at the time, the stone was hidden for a short time in a trunk in the basement of the Consulate's Public Affairs Officer, unknown to him, before it was removed. Although English, Josselyn, who was then a student at the University of Glasgow, was a Scottish Nationalist. Edward I was Josselyn's 21st great-grandfather. The smaller piece was similarly brought north at a later time. The entire stone was passed to a senior Glasgow politician, who arranged for it to be professionally repaired by Glasgow stonemason Robert Gray.\n\nA major search for the stone was ordered by the British Government, but proved unsuccessful. The custodians left the stone on the altar of Arbroath Abbey on 11 April 1951, in the safekeeping of the Church of Scotland. Once the London police were informed of its whereabouts, the stone was returned to Westminster four months after it had been removed. Afterwards, rumours circulated that copies had been made of the stone, and that the returned stone was not the original.\n\nIn 1996, in a symbolic response to growing dissatisfaction among Scots at the prevailing constitutional settlement, the British Government decided that the stone should be kept in Scotland when not in use at coronations. On 3 July 1996, it was announced in the House of Commons that the stone would be returned to Scotland, and on 15 November 1996, after a handover ceremony at the border between representatives of the Home Office and of the Scottish Office, it was transported to Edinburgh Castle. The stone arrived in the Castle on 30 November 1996, St Andrew's Day, where the official handover ceremony occurred. Prince Andrew, Duke of York, representing Queen Elizabeth II, formally handed over the Royal Warrant transferring the stone into the safekeeping of the Commissioners for the Regalia. It currently remains alongside the crown jewels of Scotland, the Honours of Scotland, in the Crown Room.\n\n\n\n"}

Unfortunately, a ship she was on, wrecked. As fate would have it, she drifted ashore in her cradle. There, an ogre couple found her, and the ogress resolved to raise Aimee, instead of eating her, resolving that the infant would make a good wife for her son when she grew up. The ogress summoned a hind from the woods to nurse the baby. After fifteen years, the king and queen gave up hope of locating the princess and the king told his brother to send his best son to be the heir to the throne. The brother chose his second son.\n\nMeanwhile, Aimee grew up among the ogres. A little ogre had fallen in love with her, but the thought of marrying him revolted her. She regularly walked along the shore after storms, to protect things swept ashore from the ogres, and one day she found a man. She saved the man, who happened to be her cousin, although neither of them knew the truth or could speak each other's language. She managed to make him understand that he had to hide in a cave. After some time hiding and feeding him, she wished to show her friendship and gave him a locket she wore. This had her name on it, and the prince deduced from her looks that she was indeed his cousin, the princess Aimee.\n\nThe little ogre decided it was time for them to marry, and horror-struck, Aimee fled to the prince. When she returned, she injured her foot on a thorn and could no longer walk. The prince wondered why she did not come, and when he tried to find her, he was captured.\n\nNow, every night, the ogres all put on golden crowns before they went to bed. The princess snuck in that night, took a crown from the head of a little ogre, and put it on the prince's head. The ogre woke up, seized on the sleeping little ogre who no longer had a crown, and ate him. Again the next night, the princess stole a crown from one of the ogres to place on the Prince's head. This time, the ogress ate the crown-less ogre.\n\nThe princess remembered the magic wand that the ogress had used to summon the hind. With it, she gave herself the power to speak the prince's language. He told her who she was, and the princess decided to steal the ogres' camel so they could ride away to safety. She used the wand to enchant a bean to hide their escape. It spoke whenever the ogress asked anything. Finally, however, the ogress realized they had fled. The ogre used his seven-league boots to follow.\n\nWhen the ogre caught up, the princess turned herself into a boatwoman, the prince into a boat, and the camel into a lake; to confuse the ogre. He found nothing, but when he returned, the ogress told him how they had been transformed with her stolen magic wand, and so he set out to find them again. This time Aimmee turned herself into a dwarf, the prince into a portrait, and the camel into a pillar. When the ogre reached her, she told an elaborate story about how the prince had fought in a tournament in honor of the lady in the picture. Confused again, the ogre returned home.\n\nThis time the ogress came after them. The princess turned the prince into an orange tree, herself into a bee, and the camel into a box. The princess stung the ogress and drove her off, but some travelers carried off the wand. Without the wand, the Princess was unable to change the group back into their prior forms.\n\nA princess, Linda, loved to walk in the woods where the orange tree stood. Linda tried to have the tree transplanted into her gardens, Aimee stung Linda out of jealousy. This caused the prince and princess to quarrel, but they soon reconciled. When Linda tried again, Aimee stung her again. Linda tried to arm herself with a branch, but when she did, blood flowed from the tree. Aimee went to fetch a balm for the wound.\n\nA fairy visited the princess and when she detected the enchantment, the fairy restored the prince. He told his story, and she restored Aimee as well, and then brought them to her parents, where they married.\n\n\n"}

In 2015, the book was shortlisted for the 'Book of the Year' award by the Cricket Writers' Club.\n\nThe book details the story of Pakistan cricket; how the game transformed from an urban, exclusive sport into a force uniting millions in a vast, disparate country. The book has five sections which contain thirty-one essays, with each section covering distinct eras of varying lengths of time. Each section starts with a match that is used to define that era, and includes essays on a maximum two players who were similarly definitive. The ultimate section covers the last 22 years, from 1992 to early 2014.\n\nA reviewer for ESPNcricinfo stated that \"this book on cricket comes across as one of the most authentic and authoritative depictions of what the country is actually like.\" He described it as a \"superbly researched book\", while criticizing \"the complete absence of any discussion of the women's game.\" The reviewer rated the book 4.5/5, writing that the book is \"highly recommended\".\n\nA reviewer for Wisden India called the book an \"ode to Pakistan cricket\". He further stated that \"the 500-odd page tribute to Pakistan cricket is more than the sum of its research material – it’s no mere quizzer-goldmine\". He adds that \"the book deserved a bigger title to match its scale\".\n\nA reviewer for Express Tribune called the book \"a triumph\" while stating that \"the research – let us call it scholarship – is immense\". A reviewer for DNA India praised the \"extensive research\". He further added that Samiuddin \"keeps the reader glued to his book\" while praising him metaphorically for \"a well-crafted century on debut\".\n\nA reviewer for New Statesman calls the book \"magnificent as stand-alone history of Pakistan cricket\". Nadeem F. Paracha, a cultural critic writing for Dawn calls the book \"a knowledgeable fan’s history of Pakistan cricket\" and \"a youthful celebration of a wildly impulsive cricketing culture\".\n\nSome of the factual/typographical errors in the book surfaced so far are:\n"}
{"id": "100824", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=100824", "title": "Uncial script", "text": "Uncial script\n\nUncial is a majuscule script (written entirely in capital letters) commonly used from the 4th to 8th centuries AD by Latin and Greek scribes. Uncial letters were used to write Greek, Latin, and Gothic.\n\nEarly uncial script is likely to have developed from late Old Roman cursive. Early forms are characterized by broad single stroke letters using simple round forms taking advantage of the new parchment and vellum surfaces, as opposed to the angular, multiple stroke letters, which are more suited for rougher surfaces, such as papyrus. In the oldest examples of uncial, such as the fragment of \"De bellis macedonicis\" in the British Library, of the late 1st-early 2nd century, all of the letters are disconnected from one another, and word separation is typically not used. Word separation, however, is characteristic of later uncial usage.\n\nAs the script evolved over the centuries, the characters became more complex. Specifically, around AD 600, flourishes and exaggerations of the basic strokes began to appear in more manuscripts. Ascenders and descenders were the first major alterations, followed by twists of the tool in the basic stroke and overlapping. By the time the more compact minuscule scripts arose circa AD 800, some of the evolved uncial styles formed the basis for these simplified, smaller scripts. Uncial was still used, particularly for copies of the Bible, tapering off until around the 10th century. There are over 500 surviving copies of uncial script, by far the largest number prior to the Carolingian Renaissance.\n\nIn general, there are some common features of uncial script:\n\n\nIn later uncial scripts, the letters are sometimes drawn haphazardly; for example, runs together at the baseline, bows (for example in , , ) do not entirely curve in to touch their stems, and the script is generally not written as cleanly as previously.\n\nDue to its extremely widespread use, in Byzantine, African, Italian, French, Spanish, and \"insular\" (Irish, British and English) centres, there were many slightly different styles in use:\n\n\nThere is some doubt about the original meaning of the word. \"Uncial\" itself probably comes from St. Jerome's preface to the Book of Job, where it is found in the form \"uncialibus\", but it is possible that this is a misreading of \"inicialibus\" (though this makes little sense in the context), and Jerome may have been referring to the larger initial letters found at the beginning of paragraphs.\n\nIn classical Latin \"uncialis\" could mean both \"inch-high\" and \"weighing an ounce\", and it is possible that Jerome was punning on this; he may conceivably also have been playing with the other meaning of \"codex\", \"block of wood\".\n\nThe term \"uncial\" in the sense of describing this script was first used by Jean Mabillon in the early 18th century. Thereafter his definition was refined by Scipione Maffei, who used to refer to this script as distinct from Roman square capitals.\n\nThe word, \"uncial\", is also sometimes used to refer to manuscripts that have been scribed in uncial, especially when differentiating from those penned with minuscule. Some of the most noteworthy Greek uncials are:\n\nThe Petropolitanus is considered by some to contain optimum uncial style. It is also an example of how large the characters were getting.\n\nFor further details on these manuscripts, see Guglielmo Cavallo \"Ricerche sulla Maiuscola Biblica\" (Florence, 1967).\n\nModern calligraphy usually teaches a form of evolved Latin-based uncial hand that would probably be best compared to the later 7th to 10th century examples, though admittedly, the variations in Latin uncial are much wider and less rigid than Greek. Modern uncial has borrowed heavily from some of the conventions found in more cursive scripts, using flourishes, variable width strokes, and on occasion, even center axis tilt.\n\nIn a way comparable to the continued widespread use of the blackletter typefaces for written German until well into the 20th century, Gaelic letterforms, which are similar to uncial letterforms, were conventionally used for typography in Irish until the 1950s. The script is still widely used in this way for titles of documents, inscriptions on monuments and other 'official' uses. Strictly speaking, the Gaelic script is insular, not uncial. Uncial Greek (commonly called \"Byzantine lettering\" by Greeks themselves) is commonly used by the Greek Orthodox Church and various institutions and individuals in Greece to this day. The Modern Greek State has also used uncial script on several occasions in official capacity (such as on seals, government documents etc.) as did many of the Greek provisional governments during the Greek War of Independence. The height of uncial usage by the Modern Greek State was during the Greek military junta of 1967–74, when even Greek Drachma coins had uncial lettering on them. Since the Metapolitefsi, the Greek State has stopped using uncial script.\n\nThe term \"half-uncial\" or \"semi-uncial\" was first deployed by Scipione Maffei, \"Istoria diplomatica\" (Mantua, 1727); he used it to distinguish what seemed like a cut-down version of uncial in the famous \"Codex Basilicanus\" of Hilary, which contains sections in each of the two types of script. The terminology was continued in the mid-18th century by René Prosper Tassin and Charles François Toustain. Despite the common and well-fixed usage, half-uncial is a poor name to the extent that it suggests some organic debt to regular uncial, though both types share features inherited from their ancient source. See now: L. E. Boyle, \"'Basilicanus' of Hilary Revisited,\" in \"Integral Palaeography\", with an introduction by F. Troncarelli (Turnhout, 2001), 105-17.\n\nLike uncial, half-uncial derived from Roman cursive, but now of a later, evolved type. It was first used around the 3rd century and remained in use until the end of the 8th century. The early forms of half-uncial were used for pagan authors and Roman legal writing, while in the 6th century the script came to be used in Africa and Europe (but not as often in insular centres) to transcribe Christian texts.\n\nSome general forms of half-uncial letters are:\n\nHalf-uncial was brought to Ireland in the 5th century, and was then carried to England. There, it was used up to the 8th century, and developed into the insular script after the 8th century.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1732660", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1732660", "title": "Velarization", "text": "Velarization\n\nVelarization is a secondary articulation of consonants by which the back of the tongue is raised toward the velum during the articulation of the consonant.\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet, velarization is transcribed by one of four diacritics:\nAlthough electropalatographic studies have shown that there is a continuum of possible degrees of velarization, the IPA does not specify any way to indicate degrees of velarization, as the difference has not been found to be contrastive in any language. However, the IPA convention of doubling diacritics to indicate a greater degree can be used: .\n\nA common example of a velarized consonant is the velarized alveolar lateral approximant (or \"dark L\"). In some accents of English, such as Received Pronunciation, the phoneme has \"dark\" and \"light\" allophones: the \"dark\", velarized allophone appears in syllable coda position (e.g. in \"full\"), while the \"light\", non-velarized allophone appears in syllable onset position (e.g. in \"lawn\"). Other accents of English, such as Scottish English, Australian English, and General American English, have \"dark L\" in all positions.\n\nFor many languages, velarization is generally associated with more dental articulations of coronal consonants so that dark l tends to be dental or dentoalveolar, and clear l tends to be retracted to an alveolar position.\n\n\nThe palatalized/velarized contrast is known by other names, especially in language pedagogy: in Irish language teaching, the terms slender (for palatalized) and broad (for velarized) are often used. The terms light or clear (for non-velarized or palatalized) and dark (for velarized) are also widespread. The terms \"soft \"l\"\" and \"hard \"l\"\" are not equivalent to \"light \"l\"\" and \"dark \"l\"\". The former pair refers to palatalized (\"soft\" or iotated) and plain (\"hard\") Slavic consonants.\n\n"}
{"id": "40853791", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40853791", "title": "War against the potato beetle", "text": "War against the potato beetle\n\nThe war against the potato beetle was a campaign launched in Warsaw Pact countries during the Cold War to eradicate the Colorado potato beetle (\"Leptinotarsa decemlineata\"). It was also a propaganda operation that alleged that the insect was introduced into East Germany, the People's Republic of Poland and Czechoslovakia by the United States as a form of entomological warfare. Communist propaganda of the time claimed that the insect was being dropped from parachutes and balloons, with the intent of immiserating the populations of these countries, causing famines, and facilitating an economic crisis.\n\nThe Colorado potato beetle, also known as the \"ten striped spearman\", is a common pest of potato crops. It is most likely native to the area between Colorado and northern Mexico, and was discovered in 1824 by Thomas Say in the Rocky Mountains. Since the mid-nineteenth century, it has been one of the most destructive pests of the cultivated potato. The insect made its way to Germany in the 1870s but was successfully eradicated. However, it made a second appearance after World War I in the Bordeaux area in France, where it probably arrived with American troops and equipment. It reached the French border with Germany by 1936 and continued spreading eastward. It was probably transferred to Czechoslovakia with the German occupation after the Munich agreement and to Poland after the Nazi invasion in 1939.\n\nThe most common method of dealing with the pest is through the use of pesticides. DDT was effectively used until the bug developed resistance by the 1950s. Subsequently, other insecticides were employed but these eventually ran into a similar problem.\n\nWhile later Cold War-era allegations were propaganda, the idea of using the beetle for purposes of warfare had factual origins. During World War I, the French did actually draft plans for using the potato beetle against the Germans and in turn, during World War II, Germany worked on developing an insect army of its own, while simultaneously alleging that such a program was being carried out by the United States and the British.\n\nThe Colorado beetle crossed the borders of the Soviet Union in 1949, but Soviet authorities were able to quickly eradicate it, and strict quarantine restrictions managed to prevent its spread, but only until 1958. After that, the beetle spread widely across USSR, greatly affecting potato crops on the collective farms and small individual plots. The latter were affected especially severely, since in USSR the private small farmers and gardeners lacked access to officially distributed effective pesticides, so the beetle, their eggs, and larvae often had to be collected by hand - often a chore assigned to children.\n\nAfter World War II, nearly half of all potato fields in the Soviet-occupied zone were infested by the beetle by 1950. \nIn East Germany in the 1950s, the insect came to be known as \"Amikäfer\", a neologism for \"Amerikanischer Käfer\" (the \"American beetle\"). Propaganda posters were issued that depicted the beetle marching across Germany, with its yellow and black stripes replaced by red and white ones with white stars on a blue background on the thorax. Other posters showed the beetle being dropped from American planes with the caption \"Kampf für den Frieden\" (\"The battle for peace\"). A letter was issued to \"the people of the world\", stating that \"the beetles are smaller than the atomic bomb... but they are also a weapon of the US imperialists in the fight against the peace-loving workers and peasants of East Germany.\" Children's books on the beetle were also published and \"Sondersuchtage\" (\"Special Search Days\") were organized in which everyone from young children to the elderly was expected to come out and gather the pests for destruction.\n\nThe communist authorities were aware, however, that the presence of the potato beetle on socialist German soil was not an American plot. An internal report of the East German Ministry of Agriculture attributed the increase in the number of pests after the war to the favorable climate and the straightforward migration of the insect from the west.\n\nIn Poland, the war against the potato beetle (\"stonka\") began in the second half of the 1940s. Articles on the plague appeared in major newspapers and farmers' magazines such as \"Przysposobienie Rolnicze i Wojskowe\" (\"Agricultural and Military Almanac\"). The official organ of the ruling communist Polish United Workers' Party \"Trybuna Ludu\" (\"People's Tribune\") reported that after being dropped on the Baltic Sea by American planes, the beetle emerged onto land and began to wage \"sabotage and diversionary actions aimed at socialist Poland\". As a result, the communist government declared a \"merciless war against the beetle\". A \"Naczelny Nadzwyczajny Komisarz\" (\"General Special Commissar\") was appointed to oversee the assault on the beetles, the country was divided into strategic sectors, and battle maps indicating enemy positions were drawn up. Simultaneously, instructions were issued to farmers describing simple and effective ways of eradicating the pest if pesticides were not available; for instance drowning specimens in water with a small admixture of kerosene. Even Poland's socialist poets joined the struggle, exemplified by Maria Kownacka's poem \"Alarm\", which instructs farmers to \"protect the potatoes!!!\" and tells either the beetle or the imperialists that \"we will not let ourselves to be starved!!!\" (exclamation marks in original).\n\nA Polish newsreel from 1950, \"Walka z stonką\" (\"The struggle against the beetle\"), claimed that \"the progressive opinion of the world has rightfully condemned the crimes of the American pilots who dropped tremendous amounts of the potato beetle on the fields of the German Democratic Republic... from where the beetle invaded Polish territory\". The news report went on to describe the campaign launched by the Polish Ministry of Agriculture to eradicate the pest through the use of DDT (\"Azotox\" in its Soviet bloc version), vigilance on Poland's Baltic coast, engagement of the Polish Air Force, and the general mobilization of society, particularly the youth. The newsreel concluded that \"the American pest will be unsuccessful both in Poland and Germany. The warmongers' provocation will crash and burn. Everyone to war against the beetle!\"\n\nIn a 1951 book published by the Polish Ministry of Defense, Zofia Kowalska wrote that American planes dropped beetles, \"violating sovereign airspace\", on the night of 24 May in East Germany, in the Zwickauer Land of Saxony.\n\nIn Poland, the propaganda campaign associated with the beetle ended by the beginning of the 1960s.\n\nIn response to the allegations issued by the Soviet bloc countries' governments, the US issued tepid denials. In August 1950, at the suggestion of the CIA, the West German authorities printed postcard-sized cardboard replicas of the potato beetle and stamped these with political slogans and the letter \"F\" for \"Freiheit\" (\"Freedom\"). A number of these were sent to all the municipal governments in East Germany and the rest dropped from a balloon over East German territory as a joke.\n\nIn the European Union, the beetle remains a regulated (quarantine) pest for the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, the Balearic Islands, Cyprus, Malta and southern parts of Sweden and Finland. It is not endemic in any of these member states, although occasional infestations occur, as in Finland in the summer of 2011, when strong winds blew from Russia.\n"}

The Warrior Vase, dated to the 13th century BCE, is probably the best-known piece of Late Helladic pottery. It is a krater, a mixing bowl used for the dilution of wine with water, a custom which the ancient Greeks believed to be a sign of civilized behavior.\n\nThe broad frieze of armed soldiers on the vase, which is incomplete, suggested the name that Schliemann gave it. The warriors are clad in short chitons, breastplates, helmets and greaves; they are armed with spears and carry shields. The bull's head handles for long encouraged scholars to date the piece later, in the early seventh century BCE.\n\nMany Scholars observe that the style of the figures and the bull head handles of this thirteenth century BCE vase are very similar to eighth century BCE pottery. Similar spearmen are also depicted in eighth century BCE pottery which introduces a curious 500-year gap in styles. This vase also leads to clues about post-palatial Mycenaean warriors. The knapsacks the warriors carry suggest that they may have to travel long distances to battle. Figures on one side of the vase wear helmets with horns. The other side depicts warriors in \"hedgehog\" style helmets. The latter is equipped with spears that are shorter than general spears depicted of the time. The warriors on both sides have shields, tunics, and leg protection. The warriors on either side appear to be uniform suggesting the army as a whole and not representing individual warriors.\n"}

It is sometimes depicted on the neck of Apis, the bull of Ptah. As time passed (according to interpretation) all of the subordinated gods of Egypt were considered to be aspects of the sun god, including e.g. Khepri.\n\nFrom roughly 2000 BC, the symbol also appears in the Levant and Mesopotamia and Asia Minor. It appears in reliefs with Assyrian rulers and in Hieroglyphic Anatolian as a symbol for royalty, transcribed into Latin as SOL SUUS (literally, \"his own self, the Sun\", i.e., \"His Majesty\").\n\nFrom ca. the 8th century BC, the winged solar disk appears on Hebrew seals connected to the royal house of the Kingdom of Judah. Many of these are seals and jar handles from Hezekiah's reign, together with the inscription \"l'melekh\" (\"belonging to the king\"). Typically, Hezekiah's royal seals feature two downward-pointing wings and six rays emanating from the central sun disk, and some are flanked on either side with the Egyptian ankh (\"key of life\") symbol. Prior to this, there are examples from the seals of servants of king Ahaz and of king Uzziah.\n\nCompare also Malachi 4:2, referring to a winged \"Sun of righteousness\",\n\nThe symbol evolved into the Faravahar (the \"visual aspect of Ahura Mazda\") in Zoroastrian Persia.\n\nThe winged sun is conventionally depicted as the knob of the Staff of Hermes.\n\nThe symbol was used on the cover of Charles Taze Russell's textbook series \"Studies in the Scriptures\" beginning with the 1911 editions. Various groups such as Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, Thelema, Theosophy and Unity Church have also used it. Variations of the symbol are used as a trademark logo on vehicles produced by the Chrysler Corporation, and Harley Davidson.\n\nA winged sun is used in the heraldry of the North America Trade Directory.\n\n\n\n"}

It was established in 1841 and is the oldest periodical in early Germanic studies still publishing.\n\nThe journal was established in 1841 by Moriz Haupt as the \"Zeitschrift für deutsches Alterthum\" (older spelling) with the objective of applying the same rigour to the philology and textual criticism of medieval German texts as was already current with Greek and Latin.\n\nWith volume 13 (1867) the \"Zeitschrift für deutsches Alterthum\" began a new series (). In 1876, with volume 19 (New Series 7) its name was changed to the present \"Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur\" and a supplement, the \"Anzeiger\", began publication as a journal of reviews; this sometimes overshadowed the parent journal.\n\nThe journal has appeared in quarterly issues since 1931. It was originally published by the Weidmannsche Buchhandlung, first in Leipzig, from 1856 in Berlin. With the third issue of volume 82 (1948/50), Franz Steiner Verlag took over publication. The current publisher is S. Hirzel Verlag.\n\nSince volume 140 (2011) the editor-in-chief has been Jürgen Wolf (University of Marburg).\n\n\nHaupt wrote a statement of purpose in the first issue in which he set out the journal's range: \"the literature, language, customs, legal history [and] belief of German antiquity\". The major focus from the beginning was publishing editions of Old and Middle High German works, which were presented for the most part for an academic readership, without explanatory material. The journal \"quickly became the most important academic forum for the 'Berlin school'\". In reaction to the narrowness of its approach, a quarterly named \"\" was founded by Franz Pfeiffer in 1856, with the objective of reflecting the broader approach of Jacob Grimm and of classical philology and of therefore laying a greater emphasis on articles than editions. The foundation of the \"Zeitschrift für deutsche Philologie\" in 1868 was also a reaction to the \"ZfdA\"'s restricted focus, in its case intended to supplement it. For at least a century, this emphasis on philology and relatively few changes of editor left the \"Zeitschrift für deutsches Altertum und deutsche Literatur\" largely untouched by changes in opinion in the field. Until the end of World War II, the editor was traditionally the Chairman of the Faculty of \"Germanistik\" at the University of Berlin. It was a relatively impersonal publication, sometimes accused of arrogance, and did not even include death notices for many decades.\n\n"}
