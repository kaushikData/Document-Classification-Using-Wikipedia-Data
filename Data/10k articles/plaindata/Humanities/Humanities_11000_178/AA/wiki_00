{"id": "670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=670", "title": "Alphabet", "text": "Alphabet\n\nAn alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that represent the phonemes (basic significant sounds) of any spoken language it is used to write. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographic systems (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit).\n\nThe first fully phonemic script, the Proto-Canaanite script, later known as the Phoenician alphabet, is considered to be the first alphabet, and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, Latin, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and possibly Brahmic. Peter T. Daniels, however, distinguishes an abugida or alphasyllabary, a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels (as in Devanagari and other South Asian scripts), an abjad, in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants (as in the original Phoenician, Hebrew or Arabic), and an \"alphabet,\" a set of graphemes that represent both vowels and consonants. In this narrow sense of the word the first \"true\" alphabet was the Greek alphabet, which was developed on the basis of the earlier Phoenician alphabet. \n\nOf the dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular is the Latin alphabet, which was derived from the Greek, and which many languages modify by adding letters formed using diacritical marks. While most alphabets have letters composed of lines (linear writing), there are also exceptions such as the alphabets used in Braille. The Khmer alphabet (for Cambodian) is the longest, with 74 letters.\n\nAlphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters. This makes them useful for purposes of collation, specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order. It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of \"numbering\" ordered items, in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements.\n\nThe English word \"alphabet\" came into Middle English from the Late Latin word \"alphabetum\", which in turn originated in the Greek ἀλφάβητος (\"alphabētos\"). The Greek word was made from the first two letters, \"alpha\"(α) and \"beta\"(β). The names for the Greek letters came from the first two letters of the Phoenician alphabet; \"aleph\", which also meant \"ox\", and \"bet\", which also meant \"house\".\n\nSometimes, like in the alphabet song in English, the term \"ABCs\" is used instead of the word \"alphabet\" (\"Now I know my ABCs\"...). \"Knowing one's ABCs\", in general, can be used as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything.\n\nThe history of the alphabet started in ancient Egypt. Egyptian writing had a set of some 24 hieroglyphs that are called uniliterals, to represent syllables that begin with a single consonant of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.\nIn the Middle Bronze Age, an apparently \"alphabetic\" system known as the Proto-Sinaitic script appears in Egyptian turquoise mines in the Sinai peninsula dated to circa the 15th century BC, apparently left by Canaanite workers. In 1999, John and Deborah Darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at Wadi el-Hol dated to circa 1800 BC and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of Egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa 2000 BC, strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time. Based on letter appearances and names, it is believed to be based on Egyptian hieroglyphs. This script had no characters representing vowels, although originally it probably was a syllabary, but unneeded symbols were discarded. An alphabetic cuneiform script with 30 signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in Ugarit before the 15th century BC. This script was not used after the destruction of Ugarit.\n\nThe Proto-Sinaitic script eventually developed into the Phoenician alphabet, which is conventionally called \"Proto-Canaanite\" before ca. 1050 BC. The oldest text in Phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of King Ahiram. This script is the parent script of all western alphabets. By the tenth century, two other forms can be distinguished, namely Canaanite and Aramaic. The Aramaic gave rise to the Hebrew script. The South Arabian alphabet, a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the Ge'ez alphabet (an abugida) is descended. Vowelless alphabets, which are not true alphabets, are called abjads, currently exemplified in scripts including Arabic, Hebrew, and Syriac. The omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory solution and some \"weak\" consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable (matres lectionis). These letters have a dual function since they are also used as pure consonants.\n\nThe Proto-Sinaitic or Proto-Canaanite script and the Ugaritic script were the first scripts with a limited number of signs, in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time, Cuneiform, Egyptian hieroglyphs, and Linear B. The Phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters, making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn. Another advantage of Phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages, since it recorded words phonemically.\n\nThe script was spread by the Phoenicians across the Mediterranean. In Greece, the script was modified to add vowels, giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the West. The vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of consonants; therefore it was the first true alphabet. The Greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in Greek to represent vowels. Vowels are significant in the Greek language, and the syllabical Linear B script that was used by the Mycenaean Greeks from the 16th century BC had 87 symbols, including 5 vowels. In its early years, there were many variants of the Greek alphabet, a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it.\n\nThe Greek alphabet, in its Euboean form, was carried over by Greek colonists to the Italian peninsula, where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the Italic languages. One of these became the Latin alphabet, which was spread across Europe as the Romans expanded their empire. Even after the fall of the Roman state, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works. It eventually became used for the descendant languages of Latin (the Romance languages) and then for most of the other languages of Europe.\n\nSome adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with ligatures, such as æ in Danish and Icelandic and Ȣ in Algonquian; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the thorn þ in Old English and Icelandic, which came from the Futhark runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the eth ð of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modified \"d\". Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, and Italian, which uses the letters \"j, k, x, y\" and \"w\" only in foreign words.\n\nAnother notable script is Elder Futhark, which is believed to have evolved out of one of the Old Italic alphabets. Elder Futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the Runic alphabets. The Runic alphabets were used for Germanic languages from AD 100 to the late Middle Ages. Its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry, although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood. These alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet, except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century.\n\nThe Old Hungarian script is a contemporary writing system of the Hungarians. It was in use during the entire history of Hungary, albeit not as an official writing system. From the 19th century it once again became more and more popular.\n\nThe Glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language Old Church Slavonic and became, together with the Greek uncial script, the basis of the Cyrillic script. Cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts, and is notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within the former Soviet Union. Cyrillic alphabets include the Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian, Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian. The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by Saints Cyril and Methodius, while the Cyrillic alphabet was invented by Clement of Ohrid, who was their disciple. They feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the Greek alphabet and the Hebrew alphabet.\n\nThe longest European alphabet is the Latin-derived Slovak alphabet which has 46 letters.\n\nBeyond the logographic Chinese writing, many phonetic scripts are in existence in Asia. The Arabic alphabet, Hebrew alphabet, Syriac alphabet, and other abjads of the Middle East are developments of the Aramaic alphabet, but because these writing systems are largely consonant-based they are often not considered true alphabets.\n\nMost alphabetic scripts of India and Eastern Asia are descended from the Brahmi script, which is often believed to be a descendant of Aramaic.\n\nIn Korea, the Hangul alphabet was created by Sejong the Great. Hangul is a unique alphabet: it is a featural alphabet, where many of the letters are designed from a sound's place of articulation (P to look like the widened mouth, L to look like the tongue pulled in, etc.); its design was planned by the government of the day; and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions, in the same way as Chinese characters, to allow for mixed-script writing (one syllable always takes up one type-space no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one sound-block).\n\nZhuyin (sometimes called \"Bopomofo\") is a semi-syllabary used to phonetically transcribe Mandarin Chinese in the Republic of China. After the later establishment of the People's Republic of China and its adoption of Hanyu Pinyin, the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it is still widely used in Taiwan where the Republic of China still governs. Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable initials are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary the phonemes of the syllable finals are not; rather, each possible final (excluding the medial glide) is represented by its own symbol. For example, \"luan\" is represented as ㄌㄨㄢ (\"l-u-an\"), where the last symbol ㄢ represents the entire final \"-an\". While Zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization system—that is, for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese characters on computers and cellphones.\n\nEuropean alphabets, especially Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of Asia. Arabic is also widely used, sometimes as an abjad (as with Urdu and Persian) and sometimes as a complete alphabet (as with Kurdish and Uyghur).\n\nThe term \"alphabet\" is used by linguists and paleographers in both a wide and a narrow sense. In the wider sense, an alphabet is a script that is \"segmental\" at the phoneme level—that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish \"true\" alphabets from two other types of segmental script, abjads and abugidas. These three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels: abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed; abugidas are also consonant-based, but indicate vowels with diacritics to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, on the other hand, consonants and vowels are written as independent letters. The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the Wadi el-Hol script, believed to be an abjad, which through its successor Phoenician is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including Arabic, Greek, Latin (via the Old Italic alphabet), Cyrillic (via the Greek alphabet) and Hebrew (via Aramaic).\n\nExamples of present-day abjads are the Arabic and Hebrew scripts; true alphabets include Latin, Cyrillic, and Korean hangul; and abugidas are used to write Tigrinya, Amharic, Hindi, and Thai. The Canadian Aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply, since each glyph stands for a consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel. (In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph.)\n\nAll three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. Ugaritic, for example, is basically an abjad, but has syllabic letters for . (These are the only time vowels are indicated.) Cyrillic is basically a true alphabet, but has syllabic letters for (я, е, ю); Coptic has a letter for . Devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use अ as a zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels.\n\nThe boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, Sorani Kurdish is written in the Arabic script, which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the Phagspa script of the Mongol Empire was based closely on the Tibetan abugida, but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short \"a\" was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the Tigrinya abugida and the Amharic abugida (ironically, the original source of the term \"abugida\") have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic. (See below.)\n\nThus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For tonal languages, further classification can be based on their treatment of tone, though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in Somali and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for Vietnamese (a true alphabet) and Thai (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the Pollard script, an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone. More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for Hmong and Zhuang. For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; in Zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the virama of Indic.\n\nThe number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small. The Book Pahlavi script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the Rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters. (The Hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the ʻokina and five long vowels. However, Hawaiian Braille has only 13 letters.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been \"conflated\"—that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in Arabic, another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented \"g\", \"d\", \"y\", \"k\", or \"j\". However, such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi papyri, up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but instead each word had to be learned as a whole—that is, they had become logograms as in Egyptian Demotic.\n\nThe largest segmental script is probably an abugida, Devanagari. When written in Devanagari, Vedic Sanskrit has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the \"visarga\" mark for final aspiration and special letters for \"kš\" and \"jñ,\" though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the \"khutma\" letters (letters with a dot added) to represent sounds from Persian and English. Thai has a total of 59 symbols, consisting of 44 consonants, 13 vowels and 2 syllabics, not including 4 diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length.\n\nThe largest known abjad is Sindhi, with 51 letters. The largest alphabets in the narrow sense include Kabardian and Abkhaz (for Cyrillic), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and Slovak (for the Latin script), with 46. However, these scripts either count di- and tri-graphs as separate letters, as Spanish did with \"ch\" and \"ll\" until recently, or uses diacritics like Slovak \"č\".\n\nThe Georgian alphabet ( \"\") is alphabetical writing system. It is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent with 33 letters. Original Georgian alphabet had 38 letters but 5 letters were removed in 19th century by Ilia Chavchavadze. The Georgian alphabet is much closer to Greek than the other Caucasian alphabets. The numeric value runs parallel to the Greek one, the consonants without a Greek equivalent are organized at the end of the alphabet. Origins of the alphabet are still unknown, some Armenian and Western scholars believe it was created by Mesrop Mashtots (Armenian: Մեսրոպ Մաշտոց Mesrop Maštoc') also known as Mesrob the Vartabed, who was an early medieval Armenian linguist, theologian, statesman and hymnologist, best known for inventing the Armenian alphabet c. 405 AD, other Georgian and Western, scholars are against this theory.\n\nSyllabaries typically contain 50 to 400 glyphs, and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands. Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.\n\nThe Armenian alphabet ( ' or ') is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the Armenian language. It was introduced by Mesrob Mashdots around 405 AD, an Armenian linguist and ecclesiastical leader, and originally contained 36 letters. Two more letters, օ (o) and ֆ (f), were added in the Middle Ages. During the 1920s orthography reform, a new letter և (capital ԵՎ) was added, which was a ligature before ե+ւ, while the letter Ւ ւ was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter ՈՒ ու (which was a digraph before).\n\nThe Armenian word for \"alphabet\" is \"\" (), named after the first two letters of the Armenian alphabet Ա այբ ayb and Բ բեն ben. The Armenian script's directionality is horizontal left-to-right, like the Latin and Greek alphabets.\n\nAlphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters, which can then be used for purposes of collation—namely for the listing of words and other items in what is called \"alphabetical order\".\n\nThe basic ordering of the Latin alphabet (A\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nX\nY\nZ), which is derived from the Northwest Semitic \"Abgad\" order, is well established, although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters (such as the French \"é\", \"à\", and \"ô\") and of certain combinations of letters (multigraphs). In French, these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation. However, in Icelandic, the accented letters such as \"á\", \"í\", and \"ö\" are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts. In Spanish, \"ñ\" is considered a separate letter, but accented vowels such as \"á\" and \"é\" are not. The \"ll\" and \"ch\" were also considered single letters, but in 1994 the Real Academia Española changed the collating order so that \"ll\" is between \"lk\" and \"lm\" in the dictionary and \"ch\" is between \"cg\" and \"ci\", and in 2010 the tenth congress of the Association of Spanish Language Academies changed it so they were no longer letters at all.\n\nIn German, words starting with \"sch-\" (which spells the German phoneme ) are inserted between words with initial \"sca-\" and \"sci-\" (all incidentally loanwords) instead of appearing after initial \"sz\", as though it were a single letter—in contrast to several languages such as Albanian, in which \"dh-\", \"ë-\", \"gj-\", \"ll-\", \"rr-\", \"th-\", \"xh-\" and \"zh-\" (all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters) would follow the letters \"d\", \"e\", \"g\", \"l\", \"n\", \"r\", \"t\", \"x\" and \"z\" respectively, as well as Hungarian and Welsh. Further, German words with umlaut are collated ignoring the umlaut—contrary to Turkish that adopted the graphemes ö and ü, and where a word like \"tüfek\", would come after \"tuz\", in the dictionary. An exception is the German telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like \"ä\" = \"ae\" since names as \"Jäger\" appear also with the spelling \"Jaeger\", and are not distinguished in the spoken language.\n\nThe Danish and Norwegian alphabets end with \"æ\"—\"ø\"—\"å\", whereas the Swedish and Finnish ones conventionally put \"å\"—\"ä\"—\"ö\" at the end.\n\nIt is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence. Some alphabets today, such as the Hanuno'o script, are learned one letter at a time, in no particular order, and are not used for collation where a definite order is required. However, a dozen Ugaritic tablets from the fourteenth century BC preserve the alphabet in two sequences. One, the \"ABCDE\" order later used in Phoenician, has continued with minor changes in Hebrew, Greek, Armenian, Gothic, Cyrillic, and Latin; the other, \"HMĦLQ,\" was used in southern Arabia and is preserved today in Ethiopic. Both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years.\n\nRunic used an unrelated Futhark sequence, which was later simplified. Arabic uses its own sequence, although Arabic retains the traditional abjadi order for numbering.\n\nThe Brahmic family of alphabets used in India use a unique order based on phonology: The letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth. This organization is used in Southeast Asia, Tibet, Korean hangul, and even Japanese kana, which is not an alphabet.\n\nThe Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound (acrophony), continue to be used to varying degrees in Samaritan, Aramaic, Syriac, Hebrew, Greek and Arabic.\n\nThe names were abandoned in Latin, which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant; the two exceptions were Y and Z, which were borrowed from the Greek alphabet rather than Etruscan, and were known as \"Y Graeca\" \"Greek Y\" (pronounced \"I Graeca\" \"Greek I\") and \"zeta\" (from Greek)—this discrepancy was inherited by many European languages, as in the term \"zed\" for Z in all forms of English other than American English. Over time names sometimes shifted or were added, as in \"double U\" for W (\"double V\" in French), the English name for Y, and American \"zee\" for Z. Comparing names in English and French gives a clear reflection of the Great Vowel Shift: A, B, C and D are pronounced /eɪ, biː, siː, diː/ in today's English, but in contemporary French they are /a, be, se, de/. The French names (from which the English names are derived) preserve the qualities of the English vowels from before the Great Vowel Shift. By contrast, the names of F, L, M, N and S (/ɛf, ɛl, ɛm, ɛn, ɛs/) remain the same in both languages, because \"short\" vowels were largely unaffected by the Shift.\n\nIn Cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on Slavic words; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in Latin.\n\nWhen an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language, an orthography generally comes into being, providing rules for the spelling of words in that language. In accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based, these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes (significant sounds) of the spoken language. In a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes, so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling, and vice versa. However this ideal is not usually achieved in practice; some languages (such as Spanish and Finnish) come close to it, while others (such as English) deviate from it to a much larger degree.\n\nThe pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.\n\nLanguages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways:\n\nNational languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard. Some national languages like Finnish, Turkish, Russian, Serbo-Croatian (Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian) and Bulgarian have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes. Strictly speaking, these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb \"to spell\" (meaning to split a word into its letters), the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables. Similarly, the Italian verb corresponding to 'spell (out)', \"compitare\", is unknown to many Italians because spelling is usually trivial, as Italian spelling is highly phonemic. In standard Spanish, one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa, as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. French, with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision, may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation, though complex, are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.\n\nAt the other extreme are languages such as English, where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way. For English, this is partly because the Great Vowel Shift occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times, retaining their original spelling at varying levels. Even English has general, albeit complex, rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate.\n\nSometimes, countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language. These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when Turkey switched from the Arabic alphabet to a Latin-based Turkish alphabet.\n\nThe standard system of symbols used by linguists to represent sounds in any language, independently of orthography, is called the International Phonetic Alphabet.\n\n\n"}

Most of the roof of one's mouth is the hard palate and the soft palate. The alveolar ridges contain the sockets (alveoli, singular \"alveolus\") of the teeth. They can be felt with the tongue in the area right above the top teeth or below the bottom teeth.

There are exceptions to this however, such as speakers of the New York accent who pronounce [t] and [d] at the back of their top teeth (dental stops). When pronouncing these sounds the tongue touches ([t], [d], [n]), or nearly touches ([s], [z]) the upper alveolar ridge, which can also be referred to as gum ridge. In many other languages, consonants transcribed with these letters are articulated slightly differently, and are often described as dental consonants. In many languages consonants are articulated with the tongue touching or close to the upper alveolar ridge.

Since the mid-19th century the two cities have been rivals in trade, sports and power. There have been proposals to connect the two capitals by a Brazzaville–Kinshasa Bridge. Studies reveal the anticipated cost is around 1.65 billion USD, but it is not expected that the project will be undertaken in the near or even distant future.\n\nBrazzaville was founded by the French colonial empire upon an existing indigenous Bateke settlement called Ncuna, as part of the Scramble for Africa. The Italian-born explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, granted French citizenship in 1874, officially founded the settlement which commemorates his name on 10 September 1880. The local King, Makoko of the Téké, signed a treaty of protection with de Brazza which subjugated his lands to the French Empire. From October 1880 until May 1882 a small squad of troops led by Senegalese Sergeant Malamine Camara occupied the site, preventing the land from falling into Belgian hands. The first large scale building work of the city only began four years later in order as a competitor with Léopoldville (now Kinshasa) which Belgian colonists built on the other side of the river.\n\nThe Berlin Conference of 1884 placed French control over the area on an official footing. The city became the capital of the French Congo in 1904. It then continued as capital with the creation of French Equatorial Africa, a federation founded in 1910, of French colonial states which encompassed Gabon, the Central African Republic and Chad until 1960. 1910–1915 saw the construction of major municipal buildings, including a courthouse and headquarters for the Banque de l'AEF and Institut Pasteur. In 1934 the Congo-Océan railway came into service, linking Brazzaville with the Atlantic port of Pointe-Noire. Construction of the railway resulted in the death of over 17,000 Africans, which led to a revolt in 1928.\n\nDuring World War II Brazzaville and the rest of French Equatorial Africa remained beyond the control of Vichy France; the city served as the capital of \"France Libre\" from 1940–1943. In 1944, Brazzaville hosted a meeting of the French resistance forces and representatives of France's African colonies. The resulting Brazzaville Declaration represented an attempt to redefine the relationship between France and its African colonies.\n\nUntil the 1960s, the city was divided into European (the center of the city) and African sections (Poto-Poto, Bacongo, and Makélékélé). In 1980 it became a \"commune\" separated from the surrounding Pool Department and divided into nine \"arrondissements\" (boroughs).\n\nThe city has frequently been a staging ground for wars, including conflicts between rebel and government forces and between forces of the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DCR), and Angola. It was also the scene of bloody civil wars throughout the 1990s which resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and which forced hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee the city. More recently thousands of people leaving the DRC have found their way to Brazzaville; the local United Nations force and the DRC government have accused the city of deporting thousands of these refugees.\n\nIn April 2016 fighting occurred between police and local militia units, with at least 18 people killed.\n\nAs of the 2007 census, it had a population of 1.37 million. The projection of the CNSEE (national statistics centre) shows an increase to 1.7 million by 2015, but the projection was made before 2007 and based on a lower estimate of the population (1.26 million) than recorded in the census. The United Nations Population Division estimate for 2014 is 1.83 million. The populous city of Kinshasa (more than 10 million inhabitants in 2014), capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, lies across the Congo River from Brazzaville. Together with Kinshasa, the combined conurbation of Kinshasa-Brazzaville would thus have about 12 million inhabitants, although significant political and infrastructure challenges prevent the two cities from functioning with any meaningful connection.\n\nBrazzaville, like Pointe-Noire, has both the status of a commune (municipality) and a department. It is thus governed by a municipal council and a departmental council. The mayor is the president of the municipal council.\n\nThe city is divided into nine \"arrondissements\" (boroughs):\n\nThe location of Brazzaville near the pool of the Congo River enabled it to grow as an industrial, trading and port settlement, in part due to the accumulation of raw materials extracted during the colonial period. Industries present in Brazzaville include machine shops, textiles, tanning, and manufacturing. As a key port on the Congo River, the city takes deliveries of raw materials, such as rubber, wood and agricultural products. From here they are generally sent onward to Pointe-Noire for export.\n\nAs the capital city of the Republic of Congo, many companies, government organizations and NGOs have regional offices in the city. The World Health Organization has its regional office for Africa located in Brazzaville. Companies headquartered in Brazzaville include Equatorial Congo Airlines and the mobile operator Warid Congo.\n\nNotable buildings in the city include the Sacred Heart Cathedral, St Anne's Basilica built in 1949 by Roger Erell, and known for its green tiled roof; Erell also designed a house in the city for Charles de Gaulle. Other buildings include the Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza Mausoleum, the Nabemba Tower and the Congressional Palace. Other features include the Marien Ngouabi Mausoleum, Brazzaville Zoo and the Poto-Poto School of Painting. The United States Embassy for the Republic of the Congo is also in Brazzaville, as is the Dutch Honorary Consulate.\n\nThe World Health Organization Regional Office for Africa is based in Brazzaville on a vast campus at the Cité du Djoué.\n\nThe Marien Ngouabi University is a public university in Brazzaville. The university was founded in December, 1971 and has approximately 26,000 students.\n\nInternational schools:\n\nBrazzaville, much like neighboring Kinshasa, features a tropical wet and dry climate. Its wet season, which runs from October–May, is longer than its dry season, which covers the remaining months. Brazzaville's driest months, July and August, see on average no significant precipitation. Since Brazzaville is south of the equator, its dry season begins at around its \"winter\" solstice, which is the month of June. The city experiences relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year. Recently, in March 2018, Brazzaville declaration was signed to promote better management and communications conservation of Cuvette central region in Congo basin. The declaration was signed by Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo and Indonesia to save peatlands as world's largest terrestrial organic carbon stock. \n\nThe city is home to Maya-Maya Airport, which lies in the centre of the city and which has regular flights to Pointe-Noire as well as international destinations in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. A flight operates twice weekly between Brazzaville and Kinshasa, but the flight time is only five minutes.\n\nThe Congo-Ocean Railway has a station in the city and in 2014 was operating the \"La Gazelle\" train service every other day to Pointe-Noire and intermediate destinations.\n\nThe city is an important river port, with ferries sailing to Kinshasa and to Bangui via Impfondo. Ferries and fast private boats serve as the primary means of connection between Kinshasa and Brazzaville. The Livingstone Falls lie on the outskirts of the city, where the Djoué River meets the Congo, rendering river transport to the coast impossible, qualifying the railway as a portage railway.\n\nAlthough there is no organised public transport system, privately owned buses are available in the capital.\n\nTaxis are available on every street and are easily recognized, being painted with a green body and white top, and the fare for a short trip is CF700. About twenty percent of the vehicles in Brazzaville are taxis. There are also collective taxis that drive certain routes and charge CF150.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The word is a variant of the Latinized name of Burchard of Worms (died AD 1025), Bishop of Worms, Germany, who compiled 20 volumes of \"Ecclesiastical Rules\".\n\nBegun in AD 1008, the materials took Burchard four years to compile. He wrote it while living in a small structure on top of a hill in the forest outside Worms, after his defeat of Duke Otto and while raising his adopted child. The collection, which he called the \"Collectarium Canonum\" or \"Decretum\", became the primary source for canon law.\n\nAlong with numerous documents from a variety of sources, including the Old Testament and Saint Augustine of Hippo, Burchard included the \"Canon Episcopi\" in this collection, under the belief that it dated from an episcopal \"Council of Anquira\" in AD 314, but no other evidence of this council exists. Because of this inclusion, Burchard has been described as something of a rationalist. As the source of canon law, Burchard's \"Decretum\" was supplanted around 1150 by the \"Decretum Gratiani\", a much larger collection that further attempted to reconcile contradictory elements of canon law.\n\nBurchard spent the years 1023 to 1025 promulgating \"Leges et Statuta Familiae S. Petri Wormatiensis\", a collection of religious laws he endorsed as just and hoped to have officially approbated.\n\nAlthough the Romans first came to Britain in 55 BC, Roman Law has had negligible influence on English common law. Latin legal phrases are used in English only because Latin was the \"lingua franca\" of the Medieval era. Although some of these phrases are in common use in law, such as \"res ipsa loquitur\", \"novus actus interveniens\", \"talem qualem\", \"de minimis non curat lex\", and \"consensus ad idem\", the common law is not premised on the principles of civil law, and their use is being replaced by that of vernacular substitutes. For example, \"Black's Law Dictionary\" previously included numerous brocards among its entries.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "616403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=616403", "title": "Chilam Balam", "text": "Chilam Balam\n\nThe Books of Chilam Balam () are handwritten, chiefly 17th and 18th-centuries Maya miscellanies, named after the small Yucatec towns where they were originally kept, and preserving important traditional knowledge in which indigenous Maya and early Spanish traditions have coalesced. Written in the Yucatec Maya language and using the Latin alphabet, the manuscripts are attributed to a legendary author called Chilam Balam, a \"chilam\" being a priest who gives prophecies and \"balam\" a common surname meaning 'Jaguar'. Some of the texts actually contain prophecies about the coming of the Spaniards to Yucatán while mentioning a \"chilam\" Balam as their first author.\nNine Books of Chilam Balam are known, most importantly those from Chumayel, Mani, and Tizimin, but more have existed. Both language and content show that parts of the books date back to the time of the Spanish conquest of the Yucatec kingdoms (1527–1546). In some cases, where the language is particularly terse, the books appear to render hieroglyphic script, and thus to hark back to the pre-conquest period.\n\nTaken together, the Books of Chilam Balam give the fullness of 18th-century Yucatec-Maya spiritual life. Whereas the medical texts and chronicles are quite matter-of-fact, the riddles and prognostications make abundant use of traditional Mayan metaphors. This holds even more true of the mythological and ritualistic texts, which, cast in abstruse language, plainly belong to esoteric lore. The historical texts derive part of their importance from the fact that they have been cast in the framework of the native Maya calendar, partly adapted to the European calendrical system. Reconstructing Postclassic Yucatec history from these data has proven to be an arduous task. The following is an overview of the sorts of texts—partly of Mesoamerican, and partly of Spanish derivation—found in the Chilam Balam books.\n\n1. History \n\n2. Formularies with Metaphors \n\n3. Myth and Mysticism\n\n4. Practical Calendars and Classifications \n\n5. Medical Recipes\n\n6. Spanish Traditions\n\nSince many texts recur in various books of Chilam Balam, establishing a concordance and studying substitution patterns is fundamental to scholarship. The archaic Yucatec idiom and the allusive, metaphorical nature of many texts present a formidable challenge to translators. The outcome of the translation process is sometimes heavily influenced by external assumptions about the texts' purpose. As a result of these factors, the quality of existing translations varies greatly.\n\nThe Spanish-language synoptic translation of Barrera Vásquez and Rendón (1948) is still useful. To date (2012), complete English translations are available for the following Books of Chilam Balam: \nAn excellent overview and discussion of the syncretism involved is to be found in the introduction to the Bricker and Miram edition of the Book of Chilam Balam of Kaua. A detailed analysis and interpretation of the main mythological and ritualistic texts with a view to their syncretic origins is given by Knowlton (2010).\n\nThe Books of Chilam Balam are referenced in \"The Falling Woman\" by Pat Murphy as source material for the description of sacrifices at Chichén Itzá.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "219364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=219364", "title": "Constitutional convention (political custom)", "text": "Constitutional convention (political custom)\n\nA constitutional convention is an informal and uncodified procedural agreement that is followed by the institutions of a state. In some states, notably those Commonwealth of Nations states that follow the Westminster system and whose political systems derive from British constitutional law, most government functions are guided by constitutional convention rather than by a formal written constitution.\nIn these states, actual distribution of power may be markedly different from those the formal constitutional documents describe. In particular, the formal constitution often confers wide discretionary powers on the head of state that, in practice, are used only on the advice of the head of government.\n\nSome constitutional conventions operate separate from or alongside written constitutions, such as in Canada since the country was formed with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1867. Others, notably the United Kingdom which lack a single overarching constitutional document, unwritten conventions are still of vital importance in understanding how the state functions. In most states, however, many old conventions have been replaced or superseded by laws (called codification).\n\nThe term was first used by British legal scholar A. V. Dicey in his 1883 book, \"Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution\". Dicey wrote that in Britain, the actions of political actors and institutions are governed by two parallel and complementary sets of rules:\n\nA century later, Canadian scholar Peter Hogg wrote,\n\nConstitutional conventions arise when the exercise of a certain type of power, which is not prohibited by law, arouses such opposition that it becomes impossible, on future occasions, to engage in further exercises of this power. For example, the constitutional convention that the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom cannot remain in office without the support of a majority of votes the House of Commons is derived from an unsuccessful attempt by the ministry of Robert Peel to govern without the support of a majority in the House, in 1834–1835.\n\nConstitutional conventions are not, and cannot be, enforced by courts of law. The primary reason for this, according to the Supreme Court of Canada in its 1981 Patriation Reference, is that, \"They are generally in conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and the courts may be bound to enforce the legal rules.\" More precisely, the conventions make certain acts, which would be permissible under a straightforward reading of the law, impermissible in practice. The court ruled that this conflict between convention and law means that no convention, no matter how well-established or universally accepted, can \"crystallize\" into law, unless the relevant parliament or legislature enacts a law or constitutional amendment codifying for a convention at which must specify request and consensus' for enactment. This principle is regarded as authoritative in a number of other jurisdictions, including the UK.\n\nSome conventions evolve or change over time. For example, before 1918 the British Cabinet requested a parliamentary dissolution from the monarch, with the Prime Minister conveying the request. Since 1918, Prime Ministers request dissolutions on their own initiative, and need not consult members of the Cabinet (although, at the very least, it would be unusual for the Cabinet not to be aware of the Prime Minister's intention).\n\nHowever, conventions are rarely ever broken. Unless there is general agreement on the breach, the person who breaches a convention is often heavily criticised, on occasions leading to a loss of respect or popular support. It is often said that \"conventions are not worth the paper they are written on\", i.e., they are unenforceable in law because they are not written down.\n\n\nNo convention is absolute; all but one (the second) of the above conventions were disregarded in the leadup to or during the constitutional crisis of 1975.\n\nIgnoring constitutional conventions does not always result in a crisis. After the Tasmanian state election, 2010, the Governor of Tasmania rejected the advice of his Premier to appoint the leader of the opposition as Premier because he felt the advice was tendered in bad faith. The Premier went on to form a new government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a convention that the Prime Minister of New Zealand should not ask for an early election unless he or she is unable to maintain confidence and supply. By the 1950s, it had also become a convention that elections should be held on the last Saturday of November, or the closest date to this range as possible. There are several times when these conventions have been broken and an election has been held several months earlier:\n\nBecause of the 1814 written constitution's pivotal role in providing independence and establishing democracy in the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament has been very reluctant to change it. Few of the developments in the political system that have been taking place since then have been codified as amendments. This reluctance has been labelled constitutional conservatism. The two most important examples of constitutional conventions in the Norwegian political system are parliamentarism and the declining power of the King.\n\nMuch of Spain's political framework is codified in the Spanish Constitution of 1978, which formalizes the relationship between an independent constitutional monarchy, the government, and the legislature. However, the constitution invests the monarch as the \"arbitrator and moderator of the institutions\" of government.\n\n\nThe following constitutional conventions are part of the political culture of Switzerland. They hold true at the federal level and mostly so at the cantonal and communal level. Mostly, they aim to reconcile the democratic principle of majority rule with the need to achieve consensus in a nation that is much more heterogeneous in many respects than other nation-states.\n\nWhile the United Kingdom does not have a written constitution that is a single document, the collection of legal instruments that have developed into a body of law known as constitutional law has existed for hundreds of years.\n\nAs part of this uncodified British constitution, constitutional conventions play a key role. They are rules that are observed by the various constituted parts though they are not written in any document having legal authority; there are often underlying enforcing principles that are themselves not formal and codified. Nonetheless it is very unlikely that there would be a departure of such conventions without good reason, even if an underlying enforcing principle has been overtaken by history, as these conventions also acquire the force of custom. Examples include:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The area has seen prominent historical events, interesting artistic creations, and unique contributions to the culture of the United States. The largest city in the area, Albany, consistently ranks high on lists of top cities/metro areas for culture, such as being 23rd in the book \"Cities Ranked & Rated\". The Albany-Schenectady-Troy metro area ranked 12th among large metro areas, and Glens Falls ranked 12th among the small metro areas, in Sperling's Best Places, and Expansion Management (a monthly business magazine) gave the Albany-Schenectady-Troy area five Stars, its highest ranking, for quality of life features.\n\nThe Capital District has many historical sites and museums covering a wide range of topics and time periods. The Albany Institute of History and Art founded in 1791 is one of the oldest museums in the nation, and the New York State Museum is the oldest and largest state museum in the nation. Many of the museums are historical sites themselves, such as Cherry Hill, the Ten Broeck Mansion, and the Schuyler Mansion in Albany, the Pruyn House in Colonie, Old Fort Johnson in Fort Johnson, and the Hart-Cluett Mansion in Troy. The Crailo State Historic Site in the city of Rensselaer was built in the early 18th century and is a museum of colonial New Netherland history. Other historical sites and museums chronicle historic events of national importance from the Revolutionary War such as the Saratoga National Historical Park in Saratoga County and the Bennington Battlefield State Historic Site in Rensselaer.\n\nThe Children's Museum of Science and Technology (The Junior Museum) in North Greenbush, the Burden Iron Works in Troy, and the Schenectady Museum in Schenectady are three museums that are focused on the technological and scientific history of the region. The Schenectady Museum also has a planetarium, as does the Albany Heritage Area Visitors Center in Albany. Though the Dudley Observatory, in Schenectady, is no longer a working observatory it still remains the oldest independent organization in the United States supporting astronomy research and has one of the finest astronomy libraries in world.\n\nSome museums in the area cover a specific topic such as the National Bottle Museum in Ballston Spa, or the Throop Drug Store Museum at the Albany College of Pharmacy. The Empire State Aerosciences Museum in Glenville, which in addition to air and space exhibits has the most extensive aviation library in New York. In Saratoga Springs is the Saratoga Automobile Museum covering the historical, technological, social, and economic impact of the automobile. Some of the museums in the region are unique, such as the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in Amsterdam, it is the only brick-and-mortar Hall of Fame for that sport. The National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs is the only museum in the United States dedicated to American professional dance.\n\nThe Capital District has many museums that cover the history of specific racial, ethnic, or religious groups. The Iroquois Indian Museum in Schoharie County documents the history and culture of the original inhabitants of the Capital District; while the Irish American Heritage Museum in Downtown Albany is the only museum dealing with Irish heritage in the United States. The Shaker Museum in Old Chatham, New York, formerly called Shaker Museum and Library, and the Watervliet Shaker Historic District in Colonie deal with the religious group of Shakers and their impact on the region; Shaker Museum Mount Lebanon manages New Lebanon, the first organized and structured Shaker village, while the Watervliet site which the Shaker Heritage Society manages was the first place Shakers settled in the United States.\n\nThere are also many places of interest to learn about the natural landscape of the Capital District, such as Howe Caverns in Schoharie and the Albany Pine Bush Discovery Center in Albany. Lester Park in Greenfield, is a site owned by the New York State Museum, it is a 490 million year old fossil seafloor.\n\nThe USS Slater (DE-766), the only escort destroyer from World War II still afloat, and a reconstruction of Henry Hudson's \"Half Moon\" are docked at Albany as floating museums.\n\nThere are several art galleries of different genres in the Capital District; most are galleries featuring work by local artists. Some have multimedia presentations and classes for locals, such as the Arts Center of the Capital Region in Troy, and the Albany Center Gallery in downtown Albany, which exhibits works by local artists within a radius of that city. The Arkell Museum in Canajoharie features American artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe, along with history of the Mohawk Valley. The Empire State Plaza in Albany has one of the most important state collections of modern art in the nation. Yaddo in Saratoga Springs and the Olana State Historic Site in Greenport, have natural and architectural works of art and have been used by artists of landscapes such as those of the Hudson River School. The Hyde Collection in Glens Falls is more of a formal art museum and includes works by Botticelli, Degas, Picasso, Raphael, Rembrandt, Renoir, and Van Gogh.\n\nSeveral of the area's colleges and universities have art museums open to the public displaying art produced locally, nationally, and internationally. These include the Esther Massry Gallery at The College of Saint Rose, Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College; the University Art Museum at the University at Albany, SUNY; and the Opalka Gallery at the Sage College of Albany.\n\nThe Capital District is home to many venues for the performing arts, some very old and some very new. Some are owned by municipalities or the state, such as the Times Union Center (owned by Albany County), the Palace Theatre (owned by the city of Albany), or the Saratoga Performing Arts Center (SPAC) and the Egg (both owned by the state of New York).\n\nThe Times Union Center is the largest venue, originally called the Knickerbocker Arena. It opened on January 30, 1990 with a performance by Frank Sinatra. In 1996, The Grateful Dead released a concert album from their March 1990 performances titled \"Dozin' at the Knick\". Some of the venues, such as Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady and the Palace Theatre in Albany are quite old and started off in the days of vaudeville. Proctor's and the Palace have evolved into hosting dance, ballet, opera, symphony orchestra, and contemporary music performances such as Proctor's hosting of Mariah Carey's filming of her 1993 Thanksgiving NBC Special. The Cohoes Music Hall, the WAMC's Performing Arts Center (The Linda) in Albany, and the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall are three smaller venues also in buildings as old as Proctor's and the Palace.\n\nThe Egg in Albany and SPAC in Saratoga Springs are newer venues for concerts, ballet, and orchestra performances both constructed during Nelson Rockefeller's tenure as governor of New York. In addition to outside acts performing in the region, there are local ones as well. The Albany Symphony Orchestra performs at the Palace and the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall, among other local venues, and a few outside the region as well. The Capital Repertory Theater in Albany and the New York State Theatre Institute (NYSTI) in Troy are local groups with their own performing space. Many local colleges have performing arts spaces as well; one of the newest and most sophisticated is the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy.\n\nOne of the largest events in the Capital District is the Tulip Fest held in Albany every spring at Washington Park. The tradition stems from when Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd got a city ordinance passed declaring the tulip as Albany's official flower on July 1, 1948. In addition, he sent a request to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to name a variety as Albany's tulip. On July 11, 1948 her reply was \"Her Majesty gladly accepts the invitation to designate a tulip as the official flower of Albany.\" She picked the variety \"Orange Wonder\", a bronzy orange shaded scarlet. The first Tulip Fest was celebrated the next year on May 14, 1949 with opening ceremonies still carried on today as tradition, such as the sweeping of State Street and the crowning of a Tulip Queen. The African-American tradition of Pinksterfest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest.\n\nThe largest Flag Day parade is held every year in Troy. The 42nd annual parade in 2009 is along a two-mile-long route. First Night celebrations are held in Saratoga Springs, while in 2006 Albany decided to eliminate its First Night celebrations in favor of a new \"Albany WinterFestival\" (WinterFest).\n\nOther major festivals in the Capital District include ethnic festivals. The Albany LatinFest which has been held since 1996 and drew 10,000 to Washington Park in 2008. In Schenectady the growing Guyanese community has celebrated the Guyanese Family Fun Day for several years in that city's Central Park. PolishFest is a three-day celebration of Polish culture in the Capital District, held in the town of Colonie for the past eight years.\n\nThe Capital District has its share of historical and tourist non-fiction books; the area however has also seen a great deal of fiction written by its natives and about the region. Some of these have been turned into movies, such as \"Ironweed\" by William Kennedy and \"Last of the Mohicans\" by James Fenimore Cooper. \"Ironweed\" is but one of a series of books by Kennedy that take place in Albany. The series is often referred to as the \"Albany Cycle\". The elusive author Trevanian also grew up in Albany and wrote \"The Crazyladies of Pearl Street\", about Albany's North Albany neighborhood along Pearl Street; commentators considered it a semi-autobiographical memoir. Gregory Maguire, author of which was source for the Broadway hit Wicked, also grew up in North Albany. Richard Lipez, under the pen-name Richard Stevenson has written nine books (four of which have been made into movies) in a series about the openly gay detective Donald Strachey, which take place in Albany.\n\nFrom the earliest days of silent movies the Capital District has been used for filming motion pictures. Some early movies filmed in the area were \"Last of the Mohicans\" in 1911, \"The Sign Invisible\" (1918), and \"Impossible Catherine\" (1919), all of which were filmed in Lake George. \"Saratoga\", produced in 1937, was shot at the Saratoga Race Course. In the 1990s, after several movies were filmed in the area, the marketing moniker \"Hollywood on the Hudson\" was promoted for the area, but never gained popularity, though it still is used by some promoters, especially for Troy.\n\nMore recently there have been many movies that have had parts filmed in the Capital District including \"The Bostonians\" (1984), \"Ironweed\" (1987), \"Scent of a Woman\" (1992), \"The Age of Innocence\" (1993), \"The Horse Whisperer\" (1998), \"The Emperor's Club\" (2002), \"The Time Machine\" (2002), \"Seabiscuit\" (2003), \"War of the Worlds\" (2005), and \"Taking Woodstock\" (2009). Most recently Downtown Albany was the site of filming for \"Salt\" starring Angelina Jolie, and the action-comedy \"The Other Guys\" starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg.\n\nThe Capital District, and Albany in particular, is home to many of the oldest congregations and places of worship in the United States. The Dutch Reformed, Episcopal, and Lutheran congregations date back to the 17th century. The area, as a Dutch colony originally, was dominated by the Dutch Reformed church from the beginning of settlement. The congregation of the First Church in Albany is the second oldest congregation in the state of New York. The pulpit was imported from the Netherlands in 1656 and is the oldest pulpit in the United States. Shortly after being constructed a memorial service was held for Alexander Hamilton here, and Theodore Roosevelt attended services here while Governor of New York. The First Lutheran Church in Albany is the oldest congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, it began as a Dutch Lutheran church 360 years ago.\n\nSt. Peter's was the first Anglican church in New York west of the Hudson River, and the first Anglican church in the state north of the city of New York. The remains of Lord Howe, who died during the French and Indian Wars were interred under the vestibule; he is the only British Lord buried in the United States. In 1868 the newly formed Episcopal Diocese of Albany met in convention at St. Peter's to choose a bishop and William Doane, rector of St. Peter's, was chosen on December 3, he was consecrated as such on February 2, 1869 in St. Peter's. Albany remains the home of the mother church and cathedral of the Episcopal diocese of Albany: the Cathedral of All Saints with Bishop William Love as current bishop.\n\nThe Capital District is also home to the Roman Catholic cathedral and mother church, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception with Bishop Howard J. Hubbard as head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany.\n\nThe oldest Black church in the Capital District is the Israel African Methodist Episcopal Church (Israel AME), it was established by Reverend William Cornish who was sent to Albany in 1828 by Bishop Richard Allen, founder of the AME denomination. The Israel AME was incorporated in 1829 and the current building on Hamilton Street dates from 1854. A state historic marker was placed in 1988 at the 160th anniversary celebrations, which also commemorates the church as a stop on the Underground Railroad.\n\nA significant Jewish presence has existed in Albany since as early as 1658, and today includes many synagogues; there are two Reform, two Conservative, a Chabad-Lubavitch, an Orthodox, and one of the few Karaite synagogues outside Israel. Congregation Berith Sholom (Covenant of Peace), a synagogue in Troy, is the oldest continuously used synagogue in the state of New York, and the second oldest house of worship in the state outside of the city of New York.\n\nIn addition, Albany is known for a landmark event in the history of American Reform Judaism: Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, one of the founders of Reform Judaism in the United States, first advocated his reforms at a synagogue in Albany, where he was Albany's first and only rabbi. Wise was also the teacher of one of only four Hebrew schools in the nation. In 1850 he came to blows with the congregation president and the police were called to quell the riot that started on the street. and this split with the existing synagogue he established in Albany the fourth Reform synagogue in the United States.\n\nThere is also a small population of Muslims in the city. The number of colleges and universities in the area help bring in more culturally diverse students, representing ranging religious beliefs. Most of the local colleges have respective Muslim Student Associations, for example. SUNY Albany even cancelled class for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha during the 2004–2005 school year, however it reverted that policy the following year due to low Muslim population.\n"}

Although the term might seem to imply \"removal\" of female characteristics, in nearly all biological contexts it refers to \"prevention\" of an aspect of female development from manifesting.\n\nIn human biology of gender, the best known example of this is the prevention of development of the müllerian duct derivatives by anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) in the 3rd and 4th months of fetal development, though the term is not commonly used in discussions of human development.\n\nIn a number of non-human mammals, there is evidence that hormones produced by the testes act directly on the brain to prevent development of female characteristics, especially female reproductive behavior.\n\n"}

He came to Boston in 1632 having been granted a patent of land and started sailing the Maine coast with a small vessel, trading with the Indians, largely for furs, especially beaver. The Skinners were the livery company whose business was the trade in skins and furs, so he may have been acting as agent for his brother in London. In 1632, traveling in the Penobscot Bay area, he was attacked by a roving band of French in a small pinnace; or possibly he was present in Castine Harbor when a French force attacked the trading post there. Whatever the details, his ship was captured and all his trade goods and provisions confiscated.\n\nFired with revenge, he traveled back to Boston, assembled a crew of 20-25 men, and entered upon a career of piracy to recoup his losses. Ironically, he did not target French shipping, probably because the English traders were wealthier.\n\nHis fame as \"the dread pirate\" derived from his attack in 1632 on the settlement of Pemaquid, which was then center of the lucrative fur trade in Maine. Few pirates had the temerity to attack a defended town. Sailing into the harbour, with what is said to be three ships, he opened fire on the stockade there, and sacked the town. The booty seized is variously said to have been £55 or $2500.\n\nSome stories say he joined the French, others that he returned to England, and others that he was hanged in Tyburn. Legend says that he buried treasure on Damariscove Island and Cushing Island in Casco Bay, Maine. The fact of his being admitted as a Skinner in 1648 shows that he did survive his piratical career and return to England. Administration of his estate was granted to his sister Susan Kendricks née Bull in Huntingdon in 1656 \n\nThe legend of Dixie Bull was soon enshrined in ballads, the most famous of them being \"The Story of Dixie Bull\" and \"The Slaying of Dixie Bull\". This ballad describes a duel between Dixie Bull and a fisherman from Pemaquid, Daniel Curtis, on an island near that town, in which Dixie Bull was killed, saving the town.\n"}

His family moved to Strasbourg after his father Friedrich Curtius was appointed president of the Lutheran Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine, and Curtius received his Abitur from the Strasbourg Protestant gymnasium. He traveled in Europe afterward, and was fluent in French and English. Albert Schweitzer, who boarded with the family between 1906 and 1912, is credited with introducing Curtius to modern French literature; of great influence also was the Romance philologist Gustav Gröber. He studied philology and philosophy in Strasbourg (doctorate, 1910), Berlin, and Heidelberg; he wrote his \"Habilitationsschrift\" for Gröber in Bonn, 1913, and began teaching there in 1914. World War I interrupted his scholarly work: Curtius served in France and Poland and was wounded in 1915; his injuries were severe enough for him to be discharged in 1916; he returned to Bonn to resume teaching.\n\nMuch of Curtius's work was done while the Nazis were in power, and his interest in humanist studies is usually seen as a response to the totalitarianism of his times. Curtius saw European literature as part of a continuous tradition that began with the Greek and Latin authors and continued throughout the Middle Ages; he did not acknowledge a break between those traditions, a division that would separate historical periods from each other and support a set of national literatures without connections to each other. Greatly interested in French literature, early in his career he promoted the study of that literature in a period in Germany when it was considered the enemy's literature, a \"humanist and heroic\" stance that earned him the criticism of the nationalist intelligentsia in Germany.\n\nHe is best known for his 1948 work \"Europäische Literatur und Lateinisches Mittelalter\". It was a major study of the Medieval Latin literature and its effect on subsequent writing in modern European languages, and argued that, first, the standard \"Classic-Medieval-Renaissance-Modern\" division of literature was counterproductive given the continuity between those literatures, and second, that \"much of Renaissance and\nlater European literature cannot be fully understood without a knowledge of that literature's relation to\nMedieval Latin rhetoric in the use of commonplaces, metaphors, turns of phrase, or, to employ the term Curtius prefers, \"topoi\"\". The book was largely responsible for introducing the \"literary topos\" concept as a scholarly and critical discussion of literary commonplaces.\n\n\n"}

Also, the Greek-based script probably helped to integrate the Gothic nation into the dominant Greco-Roman culture around the Black Sea.\n\nBelow is a table of the Gothic alphabet. Two letters used in its transliteration are not used in current English: thorn \"þ\" (representing ), and hwair \"ƕ\" (representing ).\n\nAs with the Greek alphabet, Gothic letters were also assigned numerical values. When used as numerals, letters were written either between two dots (•• = 12) or with an overline ( = 12). Two letters, (90) and (900), have no phonetic value.\n\nThe letter names are recorded in a 9th-century manuscript of Alcuin (Codex Vindobonensis 795). Most of them seem to be Gothic forms of names also appearing in the rune poems. The names are given in their attested forms followed by the reconstructed Gothic forms and their meanings.\n\nMost of the letters have been taken over directly from the Greek alphabet, though a few have been created or modified from Latin and possibly (more controversially) Runic letters to express unique phonological features of Gothic. These are:\n\n\nRegarding the letters' numeric values, most correspond to those of the Greek numerals. Gothic takes the place of Ϝ (6), takes the place of ξ (60), that of Ο (70), and that of ψ (700).\n\nDiacritics and punctuation used in the Codex Argenteus include a trema placed on \"i\", transliterated as \"ï\", in general applied to express diaeresis, the interpunct (·) and colon (:) as well as overlines to indicate sigla (such as \"xaus\" for \"xristaus\") and numerals.\n\nThe Gothic alphabet was added to the Unicode Standard in March, 2001 with the release of version 3.1.\n\nThe Unicode block for Gothic is U+10330–U+1034F in the \"Supplementary Multilingual Plane\". As older software that uses UCS-2 (the predecessor of UTF-16) assumes that all Unicode codepoints can be expressed as 16 bit numbers (U+FFFF or lower, the \"Basic Multilingual Plane\"), problems may be encountered using the Gothic alphabet Unicode range and others outside of the \"Basic Multilingual Plane\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "35954219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35954219", "title": "History of scrolls", "text": "History of scrolls\n\nA scroll (from the Old French \"escroe\" or \"escroue\"), is a roll of papyrus, parchment, or paper containing writing. The history of scrolls dates back to ancient Egypt. In most ancient literate cultures scrolls were the earliest format for longer documents written in ink or paint on a flexible background, preceding bound books; rigid media such as clay tablets were also used but had many disadvantages in comparison. For most purposes scrolls have long been superseded by the codex book format, but they are still produced for some ceremonial or religious purposes, notably for the Jewish Torah scroll for use in synagogues.\n\nScrolls were the first form of editable record keeping texts, used in Eastern Mediterranean ancient Egyptian civilizations.\n\nParchment scrolls were used by several early civilizations before the codex or bound book with pages and was invented by the Romans in the 1st century AD. Nevertheless, scrolls were more highly regarded than codices until well into Roman times where they were usually written in single latitudinal column.\n\nThe Hebrew tradition assumes that the Torah was copied by Moses onto a scroll (in about 1200 BCE) made from skin of a kosher animal, rather than papyrus as in Dynastic Egypt. Since there is no historical evidence for Moses and the events related in the Torah, there is no reliable way to know the time when Hebrews started using scrolls for their religious books.\n\nFollowing Jewish tradition, since that time scrolls, which are very durable with examples known to be hundreds of years old such as the 800-year-old Sephardic Sefer Torah from Spain, are copied from one to another.\n\nThe meticulous process of hand-copying a scroll takes about 2,000 person-hours (about one year at 40 hours per week). \n\nThe Torah scroll contains 304,805 letters (or approximately 79,000 words). \nOther books of the Tanakh are also written in scroll form, as well as the small mezuzah scrolls found in the door frames of most orthodox, conservative and reform Jewish households. Some Jewish families own their own Megillah scroll for use during Purim.\n\nThere is a difference between the כְּתִיב (\"Ketiv\"), what is and must be written (in consonantal text, with vowels omitted), and the קְרֵי (\"Qere\"), what is read.\n\nThe Jewish communities in these countries used the same techniques to manufacture scrolls, but using deer skins. The scrolls from these areas were known for their quality and durability, and were later imported into European and Indian communities.\n\nNon-Jewish vellum manufacturing also took place after the 3rd century BC.\n\nScrolls were used by the ancient Greeks. In Roman usage the scrolls were written latitudinally, usually placed on podiums with roll holders from which the rolls were unwound.\n\nThe Romans eventually found the scroll too cumbersome for lengthy works and developed the codex, which is the formal name for the modern style of book, with individual pages bound together.\n\nScrolls continued to be used at times during the Early Church era until the Early Middle Ages, but Christianity was an early adopter of the codex. It is often thought that this reflects the background in trade of many early Christians, who were used to codex notebooks, and less attached to the form that was traditional among the Roman elite and religious Jews.\n\nScrolls virtually ceased to be used for books and documents in Europe during the Middle Ages, and were reintroduced for rare use in official treaties and other international documents of great significance during and after the Baroque Era of the 0th century. These were usually written on high quality vellum, and stored in elaborate silver and gold cases inscribed with names of participants. Earlier examples were written in Latin. Scrolls continued in use for administrative and accounting purposes all over Europe. In English they were often referred to as \"rolls\", hence the Great Rolls of the English Exchequer, and titles such as Master of the Rolls (a senior judge), still used in the 21st century. The official copy of English, now British, legislation was still printed on vellum in a roll format and stored in the Palace of Westminster until 2017, when the use of Vellum was replaced with archival paper. The Exultet Scroll from Southern Italy and Byzantine Joshua Scroll were prestige objects that used the old form in a revivalist spirit.\n\nScrolls continued in use longer in the Islamic world, often elaborately decorated in calligraphic writing that included use of gold embossing and pigments when used for the writing of the Qur'an.\n\nScrolls continued in use longer in East Asian cultures like China, Korea and Japan.\n\nThe Chinese invented and perfected 'Indian Ink' for use in writing, including scrolls. Originally designed for blacking the surfaces of raised stone-carved hieroglyphics, the ink was a mixture of soot from pine smoke and lamp oil mixed with the gelatin of donkey skin and musk. The ink invented by the Chinese philosopher, Tien-Lcheu (2697 B.C.), became common by the year 1200 B.C.\n\nLater other formats came into use in China, firstly the \"sutra\" or \"scripture\" binding, a scroll folded concertina-style, which avoids the need to unroll to find a passage in the middle. By about 1,000 CE, sheet-based formats were introduced, although scrolls continued to have a place. Traditional painting and calligraphy in East Asia is often still performed on relatively short latitudinal paper scrolls displayed vertically as a hanging scroll on a wall or horizontally and flat as a handscroll.\n\nThe codex was a new format for reading the written word, consisting of individual pages loosely attached to each other at one side and bound with boards or cloth. It came to replace the scroll thanks to several problems that limited the scroll's function and readability. For one, scrolls were very long, sometimes as long as ten meters. This made them hard to hold open and read, a difficulty not helped by the fact that most scrolls in that era were read horizontally, instead of vertically as scrolling virtual documents are read now. The text on a scroll was continuous, without page breaks, which made indexing and bookmarking impossible. Conversely, the codex was easier to hold open, separate pages made it possible to index sections and mark a page, and the protective covers kept the fragile pages intact better than scrolls generally stayed. This last made it particularly attractive for important religious texts.\n\nAnother aspect that made the codex more attractive than the scroll was ease of copying. It was possible to hold open a codex with one hand and write notes- or copy the text- with the other. For early Christendom this was an invaluable asset, as the ability to mass reproduce their gospels was in high demand. Early Medieval Christians were some of the first to adopt the codex over the scroll.\n\nThe codex began to replace the scroll almost as soon as it was invented. For example, in Egypt by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll or roll by ten to one based on surviving examples, and by the sixth century the scroll had almost vanished from use as a vehicle for literature. However, in other places the scroll lingered. As mentioned above, English monarchs used so called “statute rolls” to record important legislation until well into the Middle Ages. Scrolls were also commonly used in theater productions, a practice from which the term “actor’s roll” was coined.\n\nTorah Scrolls are still used today in Jewish religious observance with almost insignificant changes despite the thousands of years in practice.\n\nSome cultures use scrolls as ceremonial texts or for decoration—such as a hanging scroll—without any obvious division of the text into columns. In some scroll-using cultures painted illustrations were used as header decorations above the text columns, either in a continuous band or broken into scenes above either a single or double column of text.\n\nOne of the few modern texts the original of which was written on what is effectively a scroll is the manuscript of Jack Kerouac's \"On the Road\", typed onto what he called \"the scroll\", made of taped-together sheets of paper.\n\nThe verb \"to scroll\" is much used in the age of screen displays—computer displays, rolling credits in films and so on—with the screen filled with text moving (scrolling) up or down or sideways, appearing at one edge of the display and disappearing at the other as if being unrolled from one side of a scroll and rolled up at the other.\n\n\n"}

The term derives from similar ones in geology, horizon or marker horizon, but where these have natural causes, archaeological horizons are caused by man. Most typically there is a change in the type of pottery found, and in the style of less frequent major artefacts. Across a horizon the same type of artefact or style is found very widely over a large area, and it can be assumed that these traces are approximately contemporary.\n\nIn the archaeology of the Americas \"Horizon\" terminology, used as proper names, has become used for schemes of periodization of major periods. \"Horizons\" are periods of cultural stability and political unity, with \"Intermediate periods\" covering the politically fragmented transition between them. In the periodization of pre-Columbian Peru and the Central Andes there are three Horizon periods, with two Intermediate periods between them. The Horizons, and their dominant cultures are: Early Horizon, Chavin; Middle Horizon, Tiwanaku and Wari culture; Late Horizon, Inca. \n\nThe same terms (Early, Middle and Late Horizons) are sometimes used for the Mesoamerican chronology, though there the five stages defined by Gordon Willey and Philip Phillips in 1958 remain dominant, and the Formative stage, Classic stage and Post-Classic stage cover approximately similar periods. More commonly lower-case horizons such as an \"Olmec horizon\" are referred to for the region.\n\nThe term is used to denote a series of stratigraphic relationships that constitute a phase, or are part of the process of determining the archaeological phases of a site. An archaeological horizon can be understood as a break in contexts formed in the Harris matrix, which denotes a change in epoch on a given site by delineation in time of finds found within contexts. \nAn example of a horizon is the dark earth horizon in England, which separates Roman artefacts from medieval artefacts and which may indicate the abandonment of urban areas in Roman Britain during the 2nd to 5th centuries. The term 'archaeological horizon' is sometimes, and somewhat incorrectly, used in place of the term layer or strata.\n\n\n"}

The term \"mafia\" is a reference to any organized crime groups strongly connected with the authorities.\n\nAccording to the critics of the mafia state concept, the term \"has now been so used and abused in popularized descriptions of organized criminal activity that it has lost much of its analytic value\".\n\nAccording to US diplomats, Alexander Litvinenko coined the phrase Mafia state. \n\nIn a critical review of Moisés Naím's essay in \"Foreign Affairs\", Peter Andreas pointed to the long existence of Italian mafia and Japanese Yakuza, writing that there were close relationships between those illicit organisations and respective governments. According to Andreas, these examples speak against incidences of mafia states as a historically new threat.\n\nIn Italy, the actions of the mafia can continue to affect people's lives today. The Italian \"Camorra\" Mafia network became powerful in the city of Naples in the 19th Century; although it can trace its origins back to 15th Century Spain and today extending its influence to European countries above Italy as well. The Cosa Nostra and 'Ndrangheta both as well existed in Italy with a confederation of about 150 different groups each with their own organizations and ruling body. Part of the network, known as the \"Casalesi clan\" became involved in business in the 1970s and 80s, eventually gaining control of large areas of the local economy \"partly by manipulating politicians and intimidating judges\". Among the contracts the clan gained was for the disposal of toxic waste, however, much of it was dumped illegally. This dumped toxic waste is thought to be cause of a rise in the number suffering from cancer in towns around Naples. The rise was first noticed two decades ago, and has been calculated that there has been a 40 and 47 per cent increase in cancer in women and men respectively. The Italian Senate is currently investigating the causes of the cancers, with illegal dumping thought to be the likely cause.\n\nKosovo, a partially recognised independent state formerly part of Serbia, was called a \"mafia state\" by Italian MEP Pino Arlacchi in 2011, and also by Moisés Naím in his 2012 essay \"Mafia States\" in the \"Foreign Affairs\". Naím pointed out that Prime Minister of Kosovo Hashim Thaçi is allegedly connected to the heroin trade. Many other crime allegations have been made, and investigated by several countries, against Thaçi.\n\nNaím also labeled Montenegro as a \"mafia state\" in the same essay, describing it as a hub for cigarette smuggling.\n\nTransnistria, an unrecognised break-away state from Moldova, has long been described by journalists, researchers, politicians and diplomats as a quasistate whose economy is dependent on contraband and gunrunning.\n\nFor instance, in 2002, Moldova's president, Vladimir Voronin, called Transnistria a \"residence of international mafia\", \"smuggling stronghold\" and \"outpost of Islamic combatants\". The allegations were followed by attempts of customs blockade. Reacting to the allegations, Russian state-run RTR aired an investigative program revealing that Transnistrian firms were conducting industrial-level manufacturing of small arms purposely for subsequent illegal trafficking via the Ukrainian port of Odessa. According to the program, the trade was controlled by and benefited from Transnistria's founder and then-ruler Igor Smirnov.\n\nHowever, more recent investigations and monitoring missions did not prove continuity in arms trafficking concerns. According to regular reports of the European Border Assistance Mission to Moldova and Ukraine (EUBAM), there have been no signs of significant weapons smuggling from Transnistria. During the press-conference on 30 November 2006 head of EUBAM Ferenc Banfi officially stated that organised smuggling of weapons in Transnistria did not exist. In 2013, Ukrainian Foreign Minister and acting chairman of the OSCE Leonid Kozhara gave an interview to \"El País\" newspaper, commenting on situation in Transnistria and results of work of the EUBAM mission. According to Kozhara, there have been no cases of arms traffic found.\n\nSome experts from Russia and Transnistria state that allegations of Transnistria being a \"mafia state\", \"black hole of Europe\", \"heaven for arms trafficking\", etc. are a carefully planned defamation campaign paid by the Moldovan government and aimed at producing negative image of Transnistria. Officials from the European Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), say they have no evidence that the Tiraspol regime has ever trafficked arms or nuclear material. Much of the alarm is attributed to efforts by the Moldovan government to increase pressure on Transdniester.\n\nThe term has been used by defector Alexander Litvinenko and some Western media to describe the political system in Russia under Vladimir Putin's rule. This characterization came to prominence following the United States diplomatic cables leak, which revealed that US diplomats viewed Russia as \"a corrupt, autocratic kleptocracy centred on the leadership of Vladimir Putin, in which officials, oligarchs and organised crime are bound together to create a 'virtual mafia state.'\" In his book titled \"Mafia State\", journalist and author Luke Harding argues that Putin has \"created a state peopled by ex-KGB and FSB officers, like himself, [who are] bent on making money above all.\" In the estimation of American diplomats, \"the government [of Russia] effectively [is] the mafia.\"\n\nAccording to the \"New Statesman\", \"the term had entered the lexicon of expert discussion\" several years before the cables leak, \"and not as a frivolous metaphor. Those most familiar with the country had come to see it as a kleptocracy with Vladimir Putin in the role of \"capo di tutti capi\", dividing the spoils and preventing turf wars between rival clans of an essentially criminal elite.\" In 2008, Stephen Blank noted that Russia under Putin is \"a state that European officials privately call a Mafia state\" that \"naturally gravitates toward Mafia-like behavior.\"\n\nNikolay Petrov, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Centre, said \"it's pretty hard to damage the Russian image in the world because it's already not very good\".\n\nThe scholar of Law and Economics Edgardo Buscaglia describes the political system of Mexico as a \"Mafiacracy\". Buscaglia characterises the condition between the state, the economy and organized crime in Mexico as a mutual interweaving, Mexico has also been labeled as a Narco-state (a country where the political power and the economy it's closely related and its relies highly on protecting the drug trafficking mafias).\n\nJonathan Benton, the former head of a United Kingdom anti-corruption agency, described Malta as a “mafia state” where money laundering transactions of hundreds of millions of euros are made every year without any problem. He made this statement while speaking on BBC radio following the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\n\nMoisés Naím, the author of \"Illicit: How Smugglers, Traffickers, and Copycats Are Hijacking the Global Economy\", wrote in an article for the American magazine \"Foreign Policy\": \"In mafia states such as Bulgaria, Guinea-Bissau, Montenegro, Myanmar (also called Burma), Ukraine, and Venezuela, the national interest and the interests of organised crime are now inextricably intertwined.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22317868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22317868", "title": "Medieval stained glass", "text": "Medieval stained glass\n\nMedieval stained glass is the coloured and painted glass of medieval Europe from the 10th century to the 16th century. For much of this period stained glass windows were the major pictorial art form, particularly in northern France, Germany and England, where windows tended to be larger than in southern Europe (in Italy, for example, frescos were more common).\n\nStained glass windows were used predominantly in churches, but were also found in wealthy domestic settings and public buildings such as town halls, though surviving examples of secular glass are very rare indeed. The purpose of stained glass windows in a church was both to enhance the beauty of their setting and to inform the viewer through narrative or symbolism. The subject matter was generally religious in churches, though \"portraits\" and heraldry are often included, and many narrative scenes give valuable insights into the medieval world. \n\nWindow glass was in use from at least the 1st century AD and colored and painted window glass for use in religious buildings was also manufactured at an early date. The earliest extant example of ecclesiastical stained glass is possibly that from San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy. A clear glass roundel with a depiction of Christ in Majesty, thought to be the 6th century, was discovered here.\n\nSome of the earliest known examples of colored window glass, datable to c. 800–820, were recovered in excavations at the Abbey of San Vicenzo in Volturno, Italy. Glass of the same colour ranges and similar date is also found in England, at the monastic sites of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth, and at other sites in the north of England. These examples are not painted. However, it was not until the advent of the monumental cathedral and church building campaigns in the 11th and 12th centuries that the demand for colored glass began to increase significantly, reaching its highest level in the 14th and 15th centuries. The oldest surviving stained glass windows still \"in situ\" are thought to be the Prophet Windows in Augsburg Cathedral, of c. 1065.\n\nA useful 12th-century source on medieval glass manufacture is the \"De Divers Artibus\" of Theophilus Presbyter. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk, believed by some scholars to be Roger of Helmarshausen, a metal glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries. \"De Divers Artibus\" describes a number of craft processes including glassmaking and glassworking.\n\nIn the 9th century, CE or earlier (books 1 and 2 of a 3-vol Mss. completed by another in the 12th, Eraclius, in \"De coloribus et artibus Romanorum\", also gives an account of methods for producing colored glass, although he may have copied much of his text from the \"Naturalis Historia\" of Pliny the Elder of c. 77AD. Now considered 'Inaccurate' date on works of Eraclius Later in the medieval period the son of Anthony of Pisa, artist and instructor Cennino Cennini, and, in 1556, Georgius Agricola also contributed texts with aspects of glassmaking and glassworking.\n\nPrior to c. 1000, most coloured glass was of a soda-lime-silica composition. In Northern Europe soda glass was eventually almost totally superseded by potash-lime-silica glass (Forest glass). Forest glass continued to be used in stained glass for the duration of the medieval period until soda glass again began to be used in the 16th century.\n\nThe potash (KO) found in Forest Glass was derived from wood ash. In \"De Divers Artibus\", Theophilus describes the use of beech wood as the preferred source of ash. Other plant matter, such as bracken, was also used. As well as containing potash, beech ash comprises an assortment of compounds including iron and manganese oxides, which are particularly important for generating colour in glass.\n\nMedieval stained glass panels could be created either by the cylinder blown sheet or crown glass (window) method.\n\nForest glass was manufactured in Burgundy and Lorraine near the Rhein; in Flanders; and in Normandy, in the Seine and Loire Valleys. It was distributed throughout mainland north-west Europe and Britain in the form of ready-made sheets. The application of painted decoration to and final shaping of the sheets was carried out at glass working centres close by the final destination of the glass.\n\nThe colour of glass could be affected by many factors. Sources of silica were often impure, with iron oxide being one of the most common impurities. The greenish hue of uncoloured glass is usually owing to the presence of a mixture of ferrous (Fe) and ferric (Fe) ions in the glass matrix. It is also possible that ‘impurities’ could be introduced at the fritting stage within the glass furnace, leading to the addition of further alumina, silica and iron oxides.\n\nInherent colour refers to the colours that may be formed in the molten glass by manipulating the furnace environment. Theophilus describes molten glass changing to a ‘saffron yellow colour’ which will eventually transform to a reddish yellow on further heating, he also refers to a ‘tawny colour, like flesh’ which, upon further heating will become ‘a light purple’ and later ‘a reddish purple, and exquisite’.\n\nThese colour changes are the result of the behaviour, under redox conditions, of the iron and manganese oxides which are naturally present in beech wood ash.\n\nIn the glass melt the iron and manganese behave as follows:\n\nIn an oxidising environment metal (and some non-metal) ions will lose electrons. In iron oxides, Fe (ferrous) ions will become Fe (ferric) ions. In molten glass this will result in a change in glass colour from pale blue to yellow/brown. In a reducing environment the iron will gain electrons and colour will change from yellow/brown to pale blue. Similarly manganese will change in colour depending on its oxidation state. The lower oxidation state of manganese (Mn) is yellow in common glass while the higher oxidation states (Mn or higher) is purple. A combination of the two states will give a pink glass.\n\nAs the manganese and iron may each be in different states of oxidation, the combination of the two can result in a broad range of attractive colours. Manganese in its fully oxidised state, if not present in too great a mass, will also act as a decolourant of glass if the iron is in its yellow, ferric form. The two colours in effect cancel each other out to produce a clear glass.\n\nExperimental manufacture of potash glass emulating Theophilus’ recipes has resulted in colours ranging from colourless to yellow, amber, brown, green, blue, pink and purple. Variation in colour hue and depth would also probably be affected by the source of the beech wood ash, depending on the soil chemistry where the beech tree grew, the age of the tree and the climate conditions.\nSome of the stronger reds, blues and greens that are a feature of medieval stained glass rely on the addition of copper oxides.\n\nEraclius’ \"De Coloribus et Artibus\" includes instructions for creating green and red glass by adding copper (probably in the form of ore or copper filings) to the batch, a method practiced since ancient times. (The chapters on how to make red, green and blue glass are missing from \"De Divers Artibus\".)\nAs with the iron/manganese colours, the colours formed by the addition of copper oxide to the glass are dependent on the different oxidation states of the added copper. In an oxidising environment blue cupric (Cu) ions are formed, in a strongly reducing environment red colloidal cuprous (Cu) oxide is formed and if reoxidised then green cuprous (Cu) oxide results.\n\nThe production of bright reds and blues in particular was straightforward, as the addition of copper to the mix resulted in the reliable creation of red, blue and green. The dominance of red and blue in Romanesque and Gothic glass is obvious. However, at York Minster, for example, it was demonstrated that 90% of the medieval glass was coloured by means of iron/manganese content.\n\nEarly medieval glass was soda-based, and although the use of soda glass in Northern Europe was almost wholly superseded by forest glass after c. 1000, there are some examples of a richly coloured blue glass (identified through XRF analysis) that was produced in the medieval period using soda as the alkali. In the UK, a considerable quantity of blue soda glass has been identified in stained glass from York Minster, and in excavations at Old Sarum and Winchester. In France, in Chartres Cathedral and St Denis in Paris, soda glass has also been found, and no doubt there must be many other examples.\n\nEvidence of recycling Roman tesserae to produce window glass in the 9th century has been identified at the Benedictine Monastery of San Vincenzo, Molise, Italy. Theophilus, in the 12th century, was also aware of such practice. He states that mosaic tesserae: ‘little square stones’ from ‘ancient pagan buildings’ along with ‘various small vessels in the same colours’ could be used to produce glass: ‘they even melt the blue in their furnaces, adding a little of the clear white to it, and they make from it blue glass sheets which are costly and very useful in windows.’ According to Theophilus, the French were particularly skilled at this process.\n\nCox suggests that the examples analysed at York could indeed be ‘Roman, or slightly later, glass re-melted in France and imported into England’.\n\nGlass comprising multiple layers of clear and (usually) red glass was known to exist in the 12th and 13th centuries. The manufacturing process is not known. Flashing was developed in the 15th century, and refers to the superimposition of a thin layer of coloured glass onto another coloured or uncoloured glass sheet. The procedure may have involved dipping a small sphere of molten glass into a molten uncoloured glass and blowing this into a cylinder form (the cylinder blown sheet process) which was then cut into sections and flattened in an annealing oven. Red, or ruby, copper-based glass, is usually flashed as the colour is too dense to be used alone. Other glass colours may also be flashed. These techniques could be remarkably sophisticated as demonstrated by 15thc. glass from the Carthusian Monastery of Pavia, where layered glasses of blue and violet; green and uncoloured; and red and uncoloured have been identified.\n\nThe paint applied to glass was a type of enamel, usually dark brown or black, formed from a mixture of: ground copper or iron oxide; powdered glass; wine, urine or vinegar; and gum arabic. other recipes could include sugar, treacle or vegetable oil. This ‘paint’ was applied in a series of washes, with fine details added last. Both the external and internal faces of the glass could be painted, adding depth to the overall composition. The enamel was fixed by ‘firing’ the glass in an annealing oven.\n\nProducing a strong clear yellow could be difficult in early stained glass as it relied upon the careful control of furnace conditions in order to create the appropriate reducing or oxidising environment. The introduction of silver stain in the early 14th century not only provided a solution to this difficulty, but also allowed greater flexibility in the way in which colour could be used. The first datable example of the use of silver stain is in the parish church of Le Mesnil-Villeman, Manche, France (1313). Silver stain was a combination of silver nitrate or silver sulphide blended with pipe clay and applied to (usually) clear glass. This technique enabled a more flexible approach to glass painting, allowing, for example, the hair of a figure to be painted on the same piece of glass as the head. It was also used to highlight details of canopywork or grisaille, and later it was added to the surface of coloured glass, to create a wider variety of glass hues.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7218910", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7218910", "title": "Minoan chronology", "text": "Minoan chronology\n\nSir Arthur Evans developed a relative dating scheme of Minoan chronology based on the excavations initiated and managed by him at the site of the ancient city of Knossos. He called the civilization that he discovered there Minoan. The same scheme was later applied to the Greek mainland and the Cyclades Islands to form a general plan for dating events of the prehistoric and early historic Aegean. The relative chronology is based on the shapes and decorative styles of Minoan pottery found at many sites on Crete and elsewhere.\n\nArthur Evans began excavating on a hill called \"tou tseleve he kephala\", \"the headland of the chieftain\", some three miles (5 km) from the north coast of Crete, on March 23, 1900. Two of the palace storerooms had been uncovered by Minos Kalokairinos in 1878, whose work ceased at the demand of the land owners. Simultaneously, coins and seals inscribed with a mysterious script were also discovered. These came to Evans' attention as the curator of the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, a position he held from 1884 to 1908. The area was rumored to have been the site of the ancient city of Knossos.\n\nEvans examined the site on March 19, 1894. Nothing further could be done at that time, but in 1898 Crete became an independent republic. In 1899 Evans purchased the land with his own funds (his family had been factory owners in industrial Britain) and decided to set up an excavation. In the first two weeks he discovered the Linear A tablets, a streak of luck exceeded only by Carl Blegen's legendary first day's dig at Pylos, when he uncovered the Pylos tablets, written in Linear B, a script also found at Kephala and named by Evans.\n\nAttacking the site with crews of hundreds of diggers, Evans uncovered most of the site's within 6 seasons. By 1905 he had named the civilization whose traces he found there \"Minoan\", after the legendary king Minos, and had created a detailed chronology of the serial phases of the pottery styles in Minoan Crete, based on what he found at Knossos. Subsequently he concerned himself mainly with restoration, an activity frowned upon by archaeologists of today. He continued to excavate there and elsewhere and to restore until 1935.\n\nEvans was knighted in 1911 for his work. In 1921, the first edition of his monumental work, \"Palace of Minos\", was released, which became indispensable for any department of classical archaeology. On Evans' death in 1941, the British School of Archaeology assumed responsibility for the excavation, later turning the property over to the Greek government, while retaining excavation rights.\n\nEvans' chronological framework had triple divisions each triply divided, a formula that has been retained, thus Early Minoan (EM) I, II and III, Middle Minoan (MM) I, II and III etc. Each subsection he divided into A and B, early and late. In 1918 Alan J. B. Wace and Carl Blegen adapted Evans' chronology to the Greek mainland and the islands, where the culture was termed Helladic and Cycladic. In 1941 Arne Furumark applied the term Mycenaean to LH and LC. As it is clear that the Mycenaean Greeks dominated at Knossos at some point in Late Minoan (LM), the latter is often included under \"Mycenaean\" or called \"Minoan-Mycenaean\".\nThe major study of Cretan pottery was Evans'. A very general stylistic trend was from dark decoration on a light background in the Early Minoan to white and red decorations on a dark wash or slip in Middle Minoan. Finally, there was a return to the earlier manner of dark on light in Late Minoan. New body shapes for vessels also emerged and various styles of decoration are evident within Evans' chronology.\n\nEvans never intended to give exact calendrical dates to the pottery periods. He did correlate them roughly to better dated Egyptian periods using finds of Egyptian artifacts in association with Cretan ones and obvious similarities of some types of Cretan artifacts with Egyptian ones. Subsequent investigators checking Evans' work varied the dates of some of the periods a little, usually less than a few hundred years, but the chronological structure remains basically as Evans left it, a solid framework for placing events of Aegean prehistory.\n\nMost criticism does not aim at the overthrow of Evans' system, but only complains that it does not capture all the data, such as local variations. Even with these faults the system has no competitors. In 1958 Nikolaos Platon proposed a new chronology at the Prehistoric Conference in Hamburg. In it, the terms \"Pre-palace\", \"Old Palace\" and \"New Palace\" were to replace Evans' scheme. The academic community accepted the scheme but not the replacement, simply stating where in Evans' system the new terms fit.\n\nThe one serious question concerns the date of the Knossos tablets. Allegations were made that Evans falsified the stratum in which the tablets were found to place the tablets at 1400 BCE when they ought to have been the same date as the Pylos tablets, 1200 BCE. This dispute became known as the Palmer-Boardman Dispute when it first appeared. Despite the intense debate that developed on the subject no conclusive evidence has yet been found to settle the question. A key part of the case was that a certain kind of vase, a stirrup jar (named from the handles) found in tablet contexts, is dated only to 1200. Other archaeologists hastened to the journalistic scene with instances of similar jars going back to 1400. The search for closure goes on. By default, archaeologists tend to use Evans' dating.\n\nThe search for a consistent chronology of Cretan civilization goes on. Other tabular chronologies have been published on the Internet by:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5800990", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5800990", "title": "Nancy Dorian", "text": "Nancy Dorian\n\nNancy Currier Dorian is an American linguist who has carried out research into the decline of the East Sutherland dialect of Scottish Gaelic for over 40 years, particularly in the villages of Brora, Golspie and Embo. Due to their isolation from other Gaelic-speaking communities, these East Sutherland villages presented a good opportunity to study language death. Dorian's study is possibly the longest such study in the field. She is considered \"a prime authority\" on language death. \"Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect\", her study into the decline of Gaelic in East Sutherland, is considered \"the first major monograph\" on language death. According to linguist Joan Argenter, Dorian's name \"is well known to scholars working in\" several areas of linguistics.\n\nNancy Dorian was born in Brunswick, Maine in 1936. She studied German at the Connecticut College for Women and graduated summa cum laude in 1958. She received an MA (1961) and PhD (1965) from the University of Michigan and taught linguistics and German at Bryn Mawr College from 1965 to 1989, and also taught at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Kiel. Dorian is now a professor emeritus at Bryn Mawr. She is a Unitarian Universalist; her hymn \"Dear Weaver of our Lives' Design\" won a prize for celebrating feminine imagery of the divine.\n\nDorian first noticed the Gaelic language while conducting fieldwork for the Linguistic Survey of Scotland in 1963. Noting that a declining localized speech form offered a chance to find out what sorts of changes took place as a speech form passed out of use, she began a long-term study of variation and change in East Sutherland Gaelic. When Dorian started studying the dialect, there were still more than 200 speakers in Brora, Golspie and Embo, including 105 in Embo, where they were more than a third of the population. Although traditional practice calls for anthropologists to change fieldwork settings, health challenges led Dorian to continue study of East Sutherland language development, a situation that had the beneficial side effect of producing a study of unprecedented scope and continuity. Previous researchers had focused on the NORM (non-mobile old rural male) speakers, who had more conservative language, at the expense of the wider speech community.\n\nShe coined the term \"semi-speaker\" for those, mostly from the younger generations, who could speak Gaelic but imperfectly. Her attention to the way that speech competence develops differently in endangered and obsolete languages led socio-linguists to take an interest in understanding different speaker types and their relations to the process of language shift and language shift reversal. Dorian criticized researchers who focused narrowly on single speakers, which conveniently ignored the variation between speakers.\n\nHer book \"The Tyranny of Tide: An Oral History of the East Sutherland Fisherfolk\" blurred the lines between linguistics and ethnology, revealing how these fields help illuminate and complement each other.\n\nDorian published sixteen years of research on East Sutherland Gaelic as \"Language Death: The Life Cycle of a Scottish Gaelic Dialect\". According to a review by Wolfgang U. Dressler, it was \"the first major monograph\" on language death. In the view of Professor Tracy Harris and Suzanne Romaine, it was the most comprehensive work on the subject that had been published; Harris also stated that it was \"a great contribution to the field of linguistics\". Dressler wrote that \"[i]t would take too long to describe all the praiseworthy aspects of this book\", and that it was \"indispensible\" to scholars of language death. Romaine highlighted the multidisciplinary perspective with which Dorian had approached her work, producing a book that would appeal to ethnographers, sociologists, Celtic scholars, historians of Scotland, and a wide range of linguists, including those specializing in sociolinguistics, historical linguistics, and syntax.\n\nDorian identified some counterintuitive ways in which language shift was functioning in East Sutherland, noting that the Gaelic language was able to adapt to modern life even while becoming moribund. No diglossia developed, because speakers were able to borrow words from English and apply them to any discussion, even for highly technical topics. She was able to classify speakers as \"older fluent speakers\", \"younger fluent speakers\", and \"semi-speakers\", describing the linguistic differences between each speaker type. Her finding that the socioeconomically homogeonous community was characterized by a high degree of variation between speakers was later elaborated in her 2010 book \"Investigating Variation: The Effects of Social Organization and Social Setting\". Certain types of syntactic distinctions, such as grammatical gender, case markings, and the two passive constructions, were lost gradually, rather than erased wholesale, as some theoreticians had predicted. Dorian did not find the same types of linguistic changes which were thought to mark endangered languages. \n\nShe postulated that the type of change in endangered languages was the same as in healthy languages, but the rate of change was greatly accelerated; the defining features of an endangered language were sociolinguistic rather than structural. Her research showed that the exclusion of Gaelic from the school curriculum was a major factor in its decline, because it reduced the number of opportunities to use Gaelic and cemented its lower status and \"usefulness\" in the eyes of the community. Another important factor, Dorian found, was the presence of prosperous English-speaking incomers which caused the poorer Gaelic speakers to connect the English language with economic success. Later research showed that the features that Dorian identified for Sutherland Gaelic's decline also applied to many other obsolescent languages.\n\nDorian was inspired to organize this collection of essays when she realized that there were no conferences or journals dedicated to the study of language death, where scholars in the field could share ideas. The book was described by Dorian as a \"stepping stone\" to future research into language death. By examining 37 languages and dialects, the authors of essays contributed to the availability of information on specific minority languages. At the same time, the different methodologies used help other researchers learn more about endangered language research. The essays elucidated how second-language learner methodologies could be applied to the study of heritage speakers of endangered languages for whom the language is not their primary mode of communication, one of Dorian's main goals for the collection. In addition, the book is was described by Carl Blyth as a \"milestone\" because it \"establishes a more coherent agenda in a disparate and still emerging field\". \"Investigating Obsolescence\" \"undoubtedly compares to other major collections of sociolinguistic essays\", according to Emanuel Drechsel.\n\nCarl Blyth wrote in 1994 that Dorian \"deserves foremost credit for consistently drawing the attention of linguists and anthropologists to the importance of endangered languages\". In 2005, Dorian was the subject of a documentary that aired on BBC Alba: \"Mar a Chunnaic Mise: Nancy Dorian agus a' Ghàidhlig\" (\"As I saw it: Nancy Dorian and Gaelic\").

It has been cited as an example of an untranslatable word, as there is no single exact English equivalent. It carries much cultural baggage in Russia and has been discussed at length by various writers.\n\nIt is derived from the adjective \nпошлый.\n\nIt has been defined as \"petty evil or self-satisfied vulgarity\", while Svetlana Boym defines it briefly as \"obscenity and bad taste\".\n\nBoym goes on to describe it at more length:\nEarly examinations of \"poshlost\" in literature are in the work of Nikolai Gogol. Gogol wrote (of Pushkin),\nIn his novels, Turgenev \"tried to develop a heroic figure who could, with the verve and abandon of a Don Quixote, grapple with the problems of Russian society, who could once and for all overcome 'poshlost’, the complacent mediocrity and moral degeneration of his environment\". Dostoyevsky applied the word to the Devil; Solzhenitsyn, to Western-influenced young people.\n\nD. S. Mirsky was an early user of the word in English in writing about Gogol; he defined it as \"'self-satisfied inferiority,' moral and spiritual\". Vladimir Nabokov made it more widely known in his book on Gogol, where he romanized it as \"poshlust\" (punningly: \"posh\" + \"lust\"). Poshlust, Nabokov explained, \"is not only the obviously trashy but mainly the falsely important, the falsely beautiful, the falsely clever, the falsely attractive. A list of literary characters personifying \"poshlust\" will include... Polonius and the royal pair in \"Hamlet\", Rodolphe and Homais from \"Madame Bovary\", Laevsky in Chekhov's 'The Duel', Joyce's Marion [Molly] Bloom, young Bloch in \"Search of Lost Time\", Maupassant's 'Bel Ami', Anna Karenina's husband, and Berg in \"War and Peace\"\". also listed\nAzar Nafisi mentions it and quotes the \"falsely\" definition in \"Reading Lolita in Tehran\".\n\nNabokov often targeted \"poshlost\" in his own work; the Alexandrov definition above refers to the character of M'sieur Pierre in \"Invitation to a Beheading\".\n\nAnother notable literary treatment is Fyodor Sologub's novel \"The Petty Demon\". It tells the story of a provincial schoolteacher, Peredonov, notable for his complete lack of redeeming human qualities. James H. Billington said of it:\nRichard Taruskin summarized poshlost as \"highfalutin bad taste,\" applying the term to a performance of the Cantata for the 20th Anniversary of the October Revolution (Prokofiev).\n\n"}
{"id": "338327", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338327", "title": "Positive liberty", "text": "Positive liberty\n\nPositive liberty is the possession of the capacity to act upon one's free will, as opposed to negative liberty, which is freedom from external restraint on one's actions. A concept of positive liberty may also include freedom from internal constraints.\n\nThe concepts of structure and agency are central to the concept of positive liberty because in order to be free, a person should be free from inhibitions of the social structure in carrying out their free will. Structurally, classism, sexism, ageism, ableism and racism can inhibit a person's freedom. As positive liberty is primarily concerned with the possession of sociological agency, it is enhanced by the ability of citizens to participate in government and have their voices, interests, and concerns recognized and acted upon.\n\nAlthough Isaiah Berlin's essay \"Two Concepts of Liberty\" (1958) is typically acknowledged as the first to explicitly draw the distinction between positive and negative liberty, Frankfurt School psychoanalyst and Marxist humanistic philosopher Erich Fromm drew a similar distinction between negative and positive freedom in \"The Fear of Freedom\" (1941), predating Berlin's essay by more than a decade.\n\nThe word \"liberty\" can refer to many things, but Isaiah Berlin recognized two main types of liberty. Berlin described a statement such as \"I am slave to no man\" as one of negative liberty, that is, freedom from another individual's direct interference. He contrasted this with a Positive Freedom statement such as \"I am my own master\", which lays claim to a freedom to choose one's own pursuits in life.\n\nCharles Taylor sees Negative Freedom as an \"opportunity-concept\": one possesses Negative Freedom if one is not enslaved by external forces, and has equal access to a society's resources (regardless of how one decides to spend their time). Positive Freedom, says Taylor, is an \"exercise-concept\": possessing it might mean that one is not \"internally\" constrained; one must be able to act according to their highest self – according to reason. Suppose a rich and powerful actor is also a drug addict. This actor may possess a great deal of negative liberty, but very little Positive Liberty according to Taylor. By Taylor's definitions, Positive Freedom entails being in a mature state of decision making, free of internal or external restraints (e.g. weakness, fear, ignorance, etc.).\n\nJean-Jacques Rousseau's theory of freedom, according to which individual freedom is achieved through participation in the process whereby one's community exercises collective control over its own affairs in accordance with the \"general will\". Some interpret \"The Social Contract\" to suggest that Rousseau believed that liberty was the power of individual citizens to act in the government to bring about changes; this is essentially the power for self-governance and democracy. Rousseau himself said, \"the mere impulse to appetite is slavery, while obedience to law \"we prescribe ourselves\" is liberty.\" For Rousseau, the passage from the state of nature to the civil state substitutes justice for instinct gives his actions the morality they had formerly lacked.\n\nG. F. W. Hegel wrote in his \"Elements of the Philosophy of Right\" (in the part in which he introduced the concept of the sphere of abstract right) that \"duty is not a restriction on freedom, but only on freedom in the abstract\" and that \"duty is the attainment of our essence, the winning of positive freedom.\n\nIn a description of positive liberty from the \"Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy\",\nPut in the simplest terms, one might say that a democratic society is a free society because it is a self-determined society, and that a member of that society is free to the extent that he or she participates in its democratic process. But there are also individualist applications of the concept of positive freedom. For example, it is sometimes said that a government should aim actively to create the conditions necessary for individuals to be self-sufficient or to achieve self-realization.\n\nIn \"Recovering the Social Contract\", Ron Replogle made a metaphor that is helpful in understanding positive liberty. \"Surely, it is no assault on my dignity as a person if you take my car keys, against my will, when I have had too much to drink. There is nothing paradoxical about making an agreement beforehand providing for paternalistic supervision in circumstances when our competence is open to doubt.\" In this sense, positive liberty is the adherence to a set of rules agreed upon by all parties involved. Should the rules be altered, all parties involved must agree upon the changes. Therefore, positive liberty is a contractarian philosophy.\n\nHowever, Isaiah Berlin opposed any suggestion that paternalism and positive liberty could be equivalent. He stated that positive liberty could only apply when the withdrawal of liberty from an individual was in pursuit of a choice that individual himself/herself made, not a general principle of society or any other person's opinion. In the case where a person removes a driver's car keys against their will because they have had too much to drink, this constitutes positive freedom only if the driver has made, of their own free will, an earlier decision not to drive drunk. Thus, by removing the keys, the other person facilitates this decision and ensures that it will be upheld in the face of paradoxical behaviour (i.e., drinking) by the driver. For the remover to remove the keys in the absence of such an expressed intent by the driver, because the \"remover\" feels that the driver \"ought not to\" drive drunk, is paternalism, and not positive freedom by Berlin's definition.\n\nErich Fromm sees the distinction between the two types of freedom emerging alongside humanity's evolution away from the instinctual activity that characterizes lower animal forms. This aspect of freedom, he argues, \"is here used not in its positive sense of 'freedom to' but in its negative sense of 'freedom from', namely freedom from instinctual determination of his actions.\" For Fromm, freedom from animal instinct implicitly implies that survival now hinges on the necessity of charting one's own course. He relates this distinction to the biblical story of man's expulsion from Eden:\n\nPositive freedom, Fromm maintains, comes through the actualization of individuality in balance with the separation from the whole: a \"solidarity with all men\", united not by instinctual or predetermined ties, but on the basis of a freedom founded on reason.\n\n\n"}

Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, many Russians have migrated to the United States and brought the language with them. Most Russian speakers in the United States today are Russian Jews. According to the 2010 United States Census the number of Russian speakers was 854,955, which made Russian the 12th most spoken language in the country.\n\nThe first Russians to land on the New World were explorers who reached Alaska in 1648. More than 200 years later, in 1867, Czar Alexander II sold Alaska to the United States. Many Russian settlers returned to Russia, but a small number of them remained. In 1882 16,918 Russian speakers lived in the US, and that number gradually increased to 387,416 by 1899.\n\nIn the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries many Russian Jews migrated to the United States, fleeing persecution at home. Though many spoke Yiddish, most knew Russian. Millions also left Russia after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. The 1920 US Census identified 392,049 United States citizens born in Russia; the statistics from a decade before that showed only 57,926 Russian-born Americans. Most of the newcomers were White émigrés. Russian immigration slowed in the 1930s and 1940s due to restrictions imposed by the Stalin government in the Soviet Union. The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service listed 14,016 Russian immigrants entering the country from 1930 to 1944. Most of those people were citizens of the USSR who refused to return to their country from trips abroad, so-called \"nevozvrashchentsy\" (non-returners).\n\nThe next big wave of immigration started in the 1970s. If they were allowed to leave, Soviet Jews had little difficulty entering the U.S., and many did so. Russian-speaking Jews constitute about 80% of all immigrants from the former Soviet states.\n\nSince 2012, New York State institutions provide free interpretations from/into Russian. Also, some state and elections documents are translated into it.\n\nRussian speakers are more likely to have a higher education degree than the national average. 92% of them have a high school diploma and 51% a bachelor's degree. 75% of Russian-speakers speak English \"well\" or \"very well\" according to the 2007 data of the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nLike most Russian Americans, Russian-speakers are concentrated in major urban areas. The New York metropolitan area contains by far the largest number of Russian-speakers. Brooklyn became home to the largest Russian-speaking community in the United States; most notably, Brighton Beach has a large number of recent Russian immigrants and is also called \"Little Odessa\". The New York state's Russian-speaking population was 218,765 in 2000, which comprised about 30% of all Russian-speakers in the nation. California came second, with 118,382 speakers, followed by New Jersey (38,566), Illinois (38,053), Massachusetts (32,580), Pennsylvania (32,189), and Washington (31,339), Florida (19,729), Maryland (17,584), and Oregon (16,344).\n\nIn California, as of 2000, the highest density of Russian speakers (21% of total population) was observed in the ZIP code 90046, corresponding to the city of West Hollywood and the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. Statewide, the city of San Francisco accounted for about 14% of all Russian speakers, the ZIP codes of Hollywood and West Hollywood accounted for 12%, and northeast Sacramento accounted for 8%. Alaska holds the title for having the oldest Russian-speaking community (some Alaskans even still speak the old Russian colonial dialect, though it's in big decline) and even its own unique dialect, dating back to the 1700s, although in much smaller numbers than other areas in the United States.\n\nIn terms of viability, the state of the language in the United States is much better compared to some other European languages, although a considerable minority of the children born to Russian-speaking parents are raised as monolingual English speakers. According to the 2010 Census data, 14.7% of the Russian speakers in the United States are aged between 5 and 17. This is significantly lower than the English speakers (18.8% aged 5–17), but much higher when compared to speakers of Polish (11.3%) and Hungarian (6.8%). The Russian-speaking population is younger in states with large Old Believer or former-USSR Evangelical concentrations, such as Alaska and Oregon.\n\nTable: Percentage of people aged 5 to 17 years among the Russian speaking population in the US, according to the 2010 Census <br>\n\nThe first Russian-language newspaper in the United States, \"Svoboda\" (\"Freedom\"), was published in 1867–1871; it was known as the \"Alaska Herald\" in English. Dozens of short-lived Russian newspaper were published until 1940. \"Russkaya Reklama\" (Russian Advertisement) weekly, founded in 1993 in Brooklyn, New York, is the largest Russian-language newspaper in the US, with a circulation of over 100,000. It consists of yellow pages with classified ads.\n\n\"Novoe russkoe slovo\" (The New Russian Word), published since 1910, was the longest published Russian daily newspaper until 2009, when it went weekly.\n\nTwo years later, in 2011, the only Russian-language daily, the \"Reporter\" (Репортер), began to be published in New York.\n\n\"Vecherniy New York\" (The Evening New York) serves Tri-State area Russian-speakers, and \"Panorama\", published since 1980, serves the Russian-speakers of the Greater Los Angeles area.\n\n\"Kstati Russian American Newspaper\" (To the Point) serves the Bay Area.\"V Novom Svete\" (In the New World) covers mostly international news and is circulated nationwide, while \"Evreiskii Mir\" (The Jewish World) is targeted at Russian-speaking Jews.\n\nSome Russian television stations in the United States include NTV America, Russkii Mir (Russian World), RTR Planeta, RT News, RTVi, Channel One, Israel Plus.\n\nRussian language stations Radio Mayak and Radio Baltica are also available in North America.

Following this, she spent a gap year teaching English and Latin in Lesotho. Her education continued at New Hall (now Murray Edwards College), University of Cambridge (BA, First Class Honours, 1973) and at Harvard Divinity School (ThM, 1975), to which she went as a Harkness Fellow. Her PhD on Ernst Troeltsch is also from the University of Cambridge (1983).\n\nCoakley has taught at Lancaster University (1976–1991), at Oriel College, Oxford (1991–1993) and at Harvard University in the divinity school (1993–2007; as Mallinckrodt Professor of Divinity, 1995–2007). She was a visiting professor of religion at Princeton University (2003–2004). In 2006, she was elected the Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge (the first woman appointed to this chair) and took up the position in 2007. In 2011, she became Deputy Chair of the School of Arts and Humanities with a four-year appointment on the General Board of the university.\n\nCoakley's teaching and research interests cover a number of disciplines cognate to systematic theology, including the philosophy of religion, the philosophy of science, patristics, feminist theory and the intersections of law and medicine with religion. Her contributions to these areas have generally been by way of co-ordinating research projects and editing or co-editing collections of papers. It was through these collaborative projects that her profile gained a level of international prominence. Indeed, at the time of her appointment to the Norris-Hulse chair in Cambridge, Coakley had not published a monograph subsequent to the 1988 publication of her doctoral thesis. She has been working on a four-volume systematic theology, the first volume of which was published in 2013 as \"God, Sexuality and the Self: An Essay 'On the Trinity\"'.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2008, Coakley co-directed, with Martin A. Nowak, the \"Evolution and Theology of Cooperation\" project at Harvard University, sponsored by the Templeton Foundation, out of which has come a co-edited volume, \"Evolution, Games, and God: The Principle of Cooperation\". An earlier interdisciplinary project on \"Pain and Its Transformations\" undertaken with Arthur Kleinman at Harvard (as part of the Mind, Brain, Behavior Initiative), produced \"Pain and Its Transformations: The Interface of Biology and Culture\" (co-ed. with Kay Kaufman Shelemay, Harvard UP, 2007).\n\nCoakley delivered the Gifford Lectures in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 2012.\n\nCoakley was ordained in the Church of England as a deacon in 2000 and as a priest in 2001. She has assisted in parishes in Waban, Massachusetts, and at Church of St Mary and St Nicholas, Littlemore, Oxford, England (where she served her title). Her training for the priesthood included periods working in a hospital and a prison. In 2011 she was appointed an honorary canon of Ely Cathedral where she assists with the morning office and Eucharist.\n\nIn 2012, she was involved in an unsuccessful attempt to change Church of England rules to allow women to become bishops.\n\nCoakley is married to J.

{"id": "43711007", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43711007", "title": "Sterilization of Native American women", "text": "Sterilization of Native American women\n\nForced Sterilization of Indigenous women is an issue affecting both Native American and First Nations women. Indigenous women have been sterilized without informed consent, or coerced into consenting to medical procedures; this has been done when they were unconscious from sedation, or during the stress of childbirth.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), through the federally-funded Indian Health Service (IHS), covertly imposed a policy of involuntary surgical sterilization upon Native American women in the United States. This policy was only revealed when members of the American Indian Movement occupied the offices of the BIA in 1972. The U.S. General Accounting Office found that the Indian Health Service sterilized 3,406 Native American women between 1973 and 1976. The study showed that 36 women under age 21 were forcibly sterilized regardless of a court-ordered moratorium on sterilizations of women younger than 21. One out of four Native American women were involuntarily sterilized through tubal ligation or hysterectomy. The procedure was often done under the pretense of a check up or abortion and most individuals were not aware they had been sterilized. In the 1970s, the average birth rate of Native American women was 3.7 however, in 1980 it fell to 1.8.\n\nIn Canada, forced and coerced sterilizations are alleged to have happened as recently as 2017. In November, 2018, it was announced that over 60 Indigenous women are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging they underwent forced or coerced sterilizations over the past 20 to 25 years in Saskatchewan, in which they were not allowed contact with their newborns until they signed forms \"consenting\" to tubal ligations.\n\nIn the 1970s, after being forced onto reservations by the United States government, or relocated into urban areas without adequate support, many Native Americans were struggling with poverty. The Indian Health Service (IHS) was their main health provider. A common sterilization procedure was the hysterectomy, a form of permanent sterilization in which the uterus is removed through the patient's abdomen or vagina. Hysterectomies were often performed on Native American women by residents without the patient's knowledge. Another common form of sterilization was tubal ligation, a sterilization procedure in which a woman's fallopian tubes are tied, blocked, or cut.\n\nQuinacrine was also used to sterilize Native American women. Quinacrine is commonly used to treat malaria, but can also be used for non-surgical sterilization. Capsules inserted into the uterus spread and destroy the lining of the Fallopian tubes.\n\nNon-permanent forms of sterilization were also used including Depo-Provera and Norplant. Depo-Provera was used mainly on intellectually disabled Native American women before it gained clearance from the FDA in 1992. Norplant, promoted by the IHS, was marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals (who were sued over insufficient disclosure of side effects including irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea and depression). Side effects of these two types of sterilization included the cessation of the menstrual cycle and excessive bleeding.\n\nUsing 2002 data from the National Survey of Family Growth, the Urban Indian Health Institute found that among women using contraception, the most common methods used by urban American Indian and Alaskan Native women age 15–44 years were female sterilization (34%), oral contraceptive pills (21%), and male condoms (21%). However among the urban Non-Hispanic Whites, the most common methods were oral contraceptive pills 36%), female sterilization (20%) and male condoms (18%).\n\nRacism and harmful stereotypes of the Native American population, held by members of the dominant culture, were factors that made Native American women targets for sterilization. The media commonly referred to Native American women by misogynist, racist slurs such as \"squaw\", defined as a \"dirty, subservient, abused, alcoholic and ugly woman who loves to torture white men.\" Negative racial stereotypes propagated the belief among the dominant culture that Native American women were unfit to raise or to have children in comparison to white women. First Nations women who have given birth in white hospitals have been coerced into being sterilized against their will; often being told it was mandatory before seeing their babies, or being lied to that it was a requirement of the delivery process. Not agreeing to the sterilization procedure would result in the withdrawal of welfare benefits. Consent forms presented to them failed to indicate that the decision would affect their ability to bear children in the future.\nStudies by the Health Research Group in 1973 and Doctor Bernard Rosenfeld's interviews in 1974 and 1975 show that this action was driven by social and economic factors.\n\nMost of the white physicians performing this procedure viewed sterilization as the best alternative for these women. They claimed it would improve their financial situation and their family's quality of life. The physicians were paid more for performing hysterectomies and tubal ligations than for prescribing other forms of birth control. The influx of surgical procedures was seen as a training for physicians and as a practice for resident physicians. In 1971, Dr. James Ryan stated that he favored hysterectomies over tubal ligations because \"it's more of a challenge...and it's good experience for the junior resident\". With fewer people applying for Medicaid and welfare, the federal government could decrease spending on welfare programs.\n\nIn the 1970s, the negative stereotypes of Native American women held by members of the dominant culture, along with racist beliefs of white superiority, contributed to the belief among white physicians that these women would not be able to limit the number of children or use birth control effectively. These factors all contributed to the sterilization policy.\n\nThe Indian Health Service (IHS) continues to offer sterilization as a method of family planning. Tubal ligation and vasectomy are the only procedures which may be performed for the primary purpose of sterilization. Legally, the IHS requires for the patient to give informed consent to the operation, be 21 years of age or older, and not be institutionalized in a correctional or mental health facility.\n\n"}

STUNT athletes are engaged from multiple backgrounds, including traditional cheerleading schools, “All Stars” who are non-school cheerleaders and acrobatics and/or gymnastics athletes. STUNT is being considered for NCAA Emerging Sport status and has been designed to meet Title IX's requirements for intercollegiate sports.\n\nIn 2011–2013 University of Louisville have kept the title of Champions for Division I Stunt. Oklahoma State University broke their streak in 2014 and have remained as the Division One champions every year since. As for Division II, University of Central Oklahoma have been the champions for three years since 2012 until Davenport University won in 2015 and kept the title the remaining year.\n\nNot only is STUNT a college sport but starting in 2014, high school teams adopted the new sport as well. In 2014, more than 160 girls from 11 high schools from New York's Public School Athletic League (PSAL), competed in NY's first STUNT competition. The competition was held at John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. Many other teams have been practicing and competing in this sport across the nation.\n\nThere are four quarters in Stunt:\n1.Partner Stunts\n2.Pyramids and Tosses\n3.Group Jumps and Tumbling\n4.Team Performance. \nThere are four rounds in the first three quarters, and three rounds in the fourth quarter. The order of competition is determined each round by the team who has control of possession. The two teams will play on opposite sides of the floor and perform routines against each other in all four quarters. Each quarter has its own level of difficulty to demonstrate.\n\nThere are two formats for the STUNT game\n1.Head to Head Includes two teams playing and competing against one another.Usually the game takes about 40 minutes. \n2.STUNT tournaments tournaments where multiple teams compete head to head. A regular three-team tournament game finishes in 1 hour, and a four-team tournament game takes approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nEvery year the USA Cheer STUNT Competition Committee develops STUNT routines and publishes them. They are responsible for determining the number of athletes and the skills needed in each routine. There are only six different plays for each quarter. The difficulty in skill of each stunt is ranged from one to six. Play one has the least difficult skill to six having the highest difficulty skill.\n\n•One head coach, and maximum of three assistants.\n\n•Game play can consist of a maximum of 20 athletes, and 30 on a team roster per team.\n\n•Spring sport season commences play in January.\n\n•Teams participate in competitions among national regions.\n\n•During the 2012 season, it is mandatory for each participating team in STUNT to attend at least three regular season games/tournaments. However, it will be increased to a minimum of 12 regular season games/tournaments upon the establishment of STUNT as an NCCA Emerging Sport.\n\n•Postseason play: Regional winners and top ranking “at-large” teams are invited to the National Championship Tournament.\n\n•National rankings are based on each team’s win-loss record, strength of schedule, and a coach/judge’s poll.\n\n•A completion floor with a size of 54 ft × 42 ft consists of nine non-spring, carpet bonded, foam mat panels with a minimum 1-3/8 in. Thickness. Each mat panel, 6 ft × 42 ft in size, will be connected along its seams using 4 in. Widen Velcro strip.\n\n•Each side of the mat will be used for teams’ seating and two mat panels for team warm-ups.\n\n•In a two team game, each team will have the entire surface of the 2 mat panels as a team practice area.\n\n•In a three or four team tournament, the 2 mat panels will be divided in half using white Velcro strips, or white athletic tape. Each team will use a practice area that is 12 x 21 feet size.\n\n•Competition floor and additional mat panels for team practice area\n\n•Scoreboard\n\n•Audio and public address sound system\n\n•Team branches\n\n•Necessary table and chairs for staff\n\n•Water stations\n\nThe host team or event producer is expected to supply the following:\n\n•A minimum of three judges\n\n•One game official\n\n•Scoreboard operator\n\n•Music/Audio operator\n\n•Announcer\n\n•Appropriate medical personnel (EMT, medical doctor and / or certified athletic trainer)\n\nSTUNT teams are required to comply with the College STUNT Safety Rules published by AACCA.\n\n•Team Warm up: Before the game begins, each team will be given 15 minutes for warm up skills on the performance area completion floor. Teams may continue to warm-up on their practice mats as needed.\n\n•Team Introductions: The visiting teams(s) will be introduced first followed by the home team.\n\n•Coin Toss or Draw for Possession: Before the play begins, the team head coaches will determine the initial possession for any game or tournament through a random drawing which is administered by the game official.\n\n•National Anthem\n\nQuarters 1, 2 and 3\n\nThere are three scoring officials who individually rank the teams according to the number of execution mistakes and the degree of those mistakes. For instance, a minor deduction (marked as a slash “/”) is counted for a slight balance error or a timing error between players or groups that does not result in a fall. A major deduction (marked as an “X”) is counted for an incomplete skill or incorrect body position such as the performance of a single full twist instead of the required double full twist. A double major deduction (XX) is counted for a fall to the ground. Two minor errors equal one major error.\nThe decision of the final ranking for the round is based on combining the individual scoring official’s rankings. Points are determined by the number of teams competing. The team with the highest final rank obtains the same amount of points as there are teams competing.\n\nQuarter 4\n\nIn the fourth quarter, teams make their own routines based on their unique skill level and talents. The routine performed in the fourth quarter is a combination of elements of the first three quarters and necessitates that each of the preceding categories must be represented so as to get full points.\nThe scoring officials individually score the elements based on the team’s performance by category, considering the difficulty of skills executed. The points from each category are accumulated to obtain a combined score for the routine.\nIn order to obtain equal balance between quarters, the round score is multiplied by three because there is only one round in the fourth quarter.\nAt any time does one of the players who are not in the specific play steps onto the mat then they will receive a minor deduction.\n\n•Each team gets sixty seconds timeout per half.\n•Timeouts are signaled by displaying the hands in a “T” figuration.\n\n•During timeouts all teams are allowed to use their warm-up area.\n\n•Start of the Game A random drawing by the team head coaches, overseen by the game official, determines the team that will start the game.\n\n•Quarter Change The initial possession in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters is given to the team with the lowest overall game score.\n\n•Second and Third Rounds of Each Quarter The team winning the preceding round gets possession for the following round.\n\n•Forfeits If a team forfeits the round, it will automatically obtain possession for the following round.\n\n•Ties If there is a tie between two teams, the team that did not have possession in the tie round will get possession.\n\n•Quarter Change If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the highest point total at that time. If a tie persists, possession is determined by the pre-game drawing results.\n\n•Second and Third Rounds of each Quarter If none of the tying team had possession in that round, possession defaults to the pre-game drawing results.\n\nIf a tie for 1st place occurs at the end of regulation, a playoff will determine the winner of the game/tournament. The playoff period consists only of quarters 1, 2 and 3. Judges will, at the end, rank the tying teams.\n\nPoints are given and declared at the end of each quarter with the game total being displayed on the event scoreboard. The game/tournament winner is the team that has accumulated the most total points for the game.\n\nGame\nTwo teams will compete Head to head, involving four quarters and halftime. Halftime is in between quarters 2+3. \nCompletion of a Round\nThis part shows that each round is finalized after the round is scored and announced.\nHalftime \nIt is a pause of 10 minutes that is given in between 2nd and 3rd quarters of a game. \nHead-to Head\nA competition including two people or teams with a similar routine on different sides concurrently. = \nNeutral Zone\nIt is a midpoint or borderline. The neutral zone is where the officials stand and is defined by 4”extensive white Velcro strips which distinguish the area from proximity mat sections. \nPractice Mats\nPractice mats consist of two mat sections and their extent is 6 feet by 42 feet appropriate to teams for warm- up areas in juxtaposition to their team bench.\nQuarter Break\nQuarter break only consists of two minutes breaks and each player takes in between quarters of play. \nRound\nIt is duration of time and each team decides 6 pre-arranged procedures for performing. The rounds are divided into three part including quarters 1, 2 and 3. The 4th quarter is related with the performance of each team and involves one round. \nRoutine Call\nThe team with possession will decide the routine which is performed in a certain round.\n\n\n\nCollege STUNT Association/STUNT Handbook/ “STUNT Resources” 2012\nhttp:// www.collegestunting.org. 1 Feb. 2012\n\n"}

What social psychologists call \"the principle of superficiality versus depth\" has pervaded Western culture since at least the time of Plato.\n\nSocrates sought to convince his debaters to turn from the superficiality of a worldview based on the acceptance of convention to the examined life of philosophy, founded (as Plato at least considered) upon the underlying Ideas. For more than two millennia, there was in the Platonic wake a general valorisation of critical thought over the superficial subjectivity that refused deep analysis. The salon style of the Précieuses might for a time affect superficiality, and play with the possibility of treating serious topics in a light-hearted fashion; but the prevailing western consensus firmly rejected elements such as everyday chatter or the changing vagaries of fashion as superficial distractions from a deeper reality.\n\nBy contrast, Nietzsche opened the modernist era with a self-conscious praise of superficiality: \"What is required is to stop courageously at the surface, the fold, the skin, to adore appearance, to believe in forms, tones, words, in the whole Olympus of appearance! Those Greeks were superficial – \"out of profundity\"!\".\n\nHis (still) preference for superficiality was however over-shadowed for most of the 20th century by modernism's full subscription to the depth/surface model, and to the privileging of the former over the latter. Frederic Jameson has highlighted four main modernist versions of the belief in a \"deeper\" reality - Marxist, psychoanalytic, existential, and semiotic - in each of which reality is understood to be concealed behind an inauthentic surface or façade. Jameson contrast these models sharply with the lack of depth, the ahistoricity, the surface-focus and flatness of the postmodern consciousness, with its new cult of the image and the simulacrum.\n\nIn the last third of the 20th century, Lyotard began challenging the Platonic view of a true meaning hidden behind surface as a \"theatrical\" world-view, insisting instead that sense manifestations had their own reality which necessarily impacted upon the purely verbal order of intelligibility. Similarly, deconstruction has increasingly sought to undo the depth/surface hierarchy, proposing in ironic style that superficiality is as deep as depth. The result has been the call to abandon the idea that behind appearances there is any ultimate truth to be found; and in consequence the growing postmodern replacement of depth by surface, or by multiple surfaces. \n\nThat process of substitution was well under way by the 1990s, when notoriously \"surface was depth\", and in the new millennium has led to a state of what has been called hypervisibility: everything is on view. In this new era of exposure we are all submerged in what the psychoanalyst Michael Parsons has called \"the totalist world where there is a horror of inwardness; everything must be revealed\".\n\nIf postmodernism's proponents welcomed the way a new transcendence of the surface /depth dichotomy allowed a fuller appreciation of the possibilities of the superficial - the surface consciousness of the now, as opposed to the depths of historical time - critics like J. G. Ballard object that the end-product is a world of \"laws without penalties, events without significance, a sun without shadows\": of surface without depth. They see postmodern superficiality as a by-product of the false consciousness of global capitalism, where surface distractions, news, and entertainment supersaturate the zapping mind in such a way as to foreclose the possibility of envisioning any critical alternative.\n\nAlmost all depth psychologies defy the postmodern to value depth over surface - to aim, in David Cooper's words, for \"change from the depths of oneself upwards into the \"superficies\" of one's social appearance\". Debates may rage over whether to \"begin\" analysis at the surface or by way of deep interpretations, but this is essentially a question of timing. Thus for example Jungians would highlight at the start of therapy what they call the \"persona-restoring\" phase as an effort to preserve superficiality, but would later optimally see the client moving from the surface to deeper emotion and creativity.\n\nFritz Perls by contrast maintained that \"the simplicity of the Gestalt approach is that we pay attention to the obvious, to the utmost surface. We don't delve into a region which we don't know anything about, into the so-called 'unconscious. A similar focus on the superficial has fuelled much of the Freud Wars of late modernity, in which, according to Jonathan Lear, \"the real object of attack - for which Freud is only a stalking-horse - is the very idea that humans have unconscious motivation\". Given a choice of surface or depth—\"are we to see humans as having depth, layers of meaning which lie beneath the surface of their own understanding?\"—he asks: \"Or are we to take ourselves as transparent to ourselves...to ignore the complexity, depth and darkness of human life\"; the postmodern bias remains towards superficiality.\n\nSocial psychology considers that in everyday life social processing veers between superficiality, where we rely on first impressions and immediate judgements, and a deeper form of processing in which we seek to understand the other person more fully. In the ordinary course of life, we necessarily take others at face-value, and use ideal types/stereotypes to guide our daily activities; while institutions too can rely on the superficial consensus of groupthink to preclude deeper investigation.\n\nSome circumstances however necessitate a shift from superficial to extensive processing. When things become serious, we must put more and deeper thought into understanding, leaving superficial judgements to cases where the stakes are low, not high.\n\n\n"}

The book is about the South African government's banning and subsequent unbanning of Gordimer's 1979 novel \"Burger's Daughter\".\n\nThe book was published in Johannesburg by Taurus Publications, a small underground publishing house established in the late-1970s to print anti-apartheid literature and other material South African publishers would avoid for fear of censorship. Its publications were generally distributed privately or sent to bookshops to be given to customers free to avoid attracting the attention of the South African authorities.\n\n\nIn the book's titular essay, Gordimer documents the publication history and fate of \"Burger's Daughter\", and investigates the implications of the banning and unbanning of works in South Africa. The official communiqué by the Director of Publications, Richard Smith stating his reason for banning the book a month after publication is reproduced here in full. These charges include \"propagating Communist opinions\", \"creating a psychosis of revolution and rebellion\", and \"making several unbridled attacks against the authority entrusted with the maintenance of law and order and the safety of the state\". In another essay by Gordimer, \"What the Book is About\", she responds to each of the charges, showing how, by extensively quoting out of context, the Publications Control Board displayed their \"inability ... to pass qualified judgment\" on the book.\n\nThe reasons for lifting the ban by the Publications Appeal Board three months later, on the recommendation of a panel of literary experts and a state security specialist, are also reproduced here. The state security specialist had reported that the book posed no threat to the security of South Africa, and the literary experts had accused the censorship board \"of bias, prejudice, and literary incompetence\", and that \"[i]t has not read accurately, it has severely distorted by quoting extensively out of context, it has not considered the work as a literary work deserves to be considered, and it has directly, and by implication, smeared the authoress [sic].\" In the final essay in the book University of the Witwatersrand law professor John Dugard examines censorship in South Africa within the country's legal framework.\n\nIn a review published in \"World Literature Today\", Carrol Lasker wrote that in \"What Happened to Burger's Daughter\", Gordimer investigates the \"sinister implications of the practice of banning and unbanning\", and described the book as \"a dramatic, detailed and useful model\" of the workings of censorship in South Africa. Writing in \"Research in African Literatures\", Sheila Roberts said that the book \"exposes in a thorough and unprecedented way the bungling and ignorance of a censorship committee\" and its \"pathetic face-saving efforts\" to undo the damage it had done.\n"}

Historically in Continental Europe wind rights were manorial rights and obligations relating to the operation and profitability of windmills. In modern times, as wind becomes a more important source of power, rights relating to wind turbines and windmills are sometimes referred to as \"wind rights\".\n\nHistorically, \"wind rights\" (Dutch: \"windrecht\") referred to a tax paid by millers in large parts of the Low Countries before around 1800. The tax was paid on the \"wind catch\" (\"windvang\") needed to turn a windmill, but it was often based on the windmill's output.\n\nSince a windmill in a \"heerlijkheid\" was primarily the property of the lord (although leased out to a miller), wind rights were one way for a lord to discourage competition. In consideration for payment of this tax, the lord ensured that there were no wind obstructions around the mill by imposing a prohibition on buildings and high trees in the area. Another obligation imposed on residents was the \"mill obligation\" (\"molendwang\"), which required them to have their grain ground at the lord's mill. To a certain extent, this was another way for a lord to safeguard the income received from the mill.\n\nBecause of these rights and obligations, windmills had to be identifiable. They each had a name, traditionally the name of an animal. An image of the animal was placed on the mill so that even the illiterate would know which mill was which.\n\nIn the Netherlands, wind rights and the mill obligations were ended around 1800 when a new constitution was introduced in the Batavian Republic. Similar concepts still exist in modern times. Since around 1973 the wind needed to turn a mill has been referred to as the \"windmill biotope\" (\"molenbiotoop\"). An area of around a windmill is maintained as a \"free zone\" so that the windmill can have enough wind. For polder windmills, ensuring that windmills have enough wind is the responsibility of the water board (\"waterschap\" or \"hoogheemraadschap\"). However, this seldom takes priority over the desire of municipalities to build new housing.\n\nIn the United States, as a result of the increased interest in wind energy, developers or utilities purchase “wind rights\" from landowners to allow the installation of one or more wind generators and an access road to the equipment in exchange for a payment to the landowner.\n\n\n"}
