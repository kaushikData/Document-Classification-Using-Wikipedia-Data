{"id": "2226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2226", "title": "Ad hominem", "text": "Ad hominem\n\nAd hominem (Latin for \"to the person\"), short for argumentum ad hominem, is a fallacious argumentative strategy whereby genuine discussion of the topic at hand is avoided by instead attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, or persons associated with the argument, rather than attacking the substance of the argument itself. The terms \"ad mulierem\" and \"ad feminam\" have been used specifically when the person receiving the criticism is female.\n\nHowever, its original meaning was an argument \"calculated to appeal to the person addressed more than to impartial reason\".\n\nFallacious \"ad hominem\" reasoning is categorized among informal fallacies, more precisely as a genetic fallacy, a subcategory of fallacies of irrelevance.\n\n\"Ad hominem tu quoque\" (literally: \"You also\") refers to a claim that the source making the argument has spoken or acted in a way inconsistent with the argument. In particular, if Source A criticizes the actions of Source B, a \"tu quoque\" response is that Source A has acted in the same way. This argument is invalid because it does not disprove the premise; if the premise is true then Source A may be a hypocrite, but this does not make the statement less credible from a logical perspective. Indeed, Source A may be in a position to provide personal testimony to support the argument.\n\nFor example, a father may tell his son not to start smoking as he will regret it when he is older, and the son may point out that his father is or was a smoker. This does not alter the fact that his son may regret smoking when he is older.\n\n\"Circumstantial ad hominem\" points out that someone is in circumstances such that they are disposed to take a particular position. It constitutes an attack on the bias of a source. This is fallacious because a disposition to make a certain argument does not make the argument invalid; this overlaps with the genetic fallacy (an argument that a claim is incorrect due to its source).\n\nThe circumstantial fallacy does not apply where the source is taking a position by using a logical argument based solely on premises that are generally accepted. Where the source seeks to convince an audience of the truth of a premise by a claim of authority or by personal observation, observation of their circumstances may reduce the evidentiary weight of the claims, sometimes to zero.\n\nExamples:\n\n\nHowever, this argument is valid only insofar as it devalues the denial; it does \"not\" strengthen the original claim. To construe invalid evidence of the denial as valid evidence of the original claim is fallacious (on several different bases, including that of \"argumentum ad hominem\" and \"appeal to emotions\"); however likely the man in question would be to deny an affair that did in fact happen, he is even more likely to deny an affair that never happened. (For example, inferring guilt from a denialor, less starkly, excessive devaluation of a denialis a very common feature in conspiracy theories, witch-hunts, show trials, struggle sessions, and other coercive circumstances in which the person targeted is presumed guilty.)\n\n\nGuilt by association can sometimes also be a type of \"ad hominem\" fallacy if the argument attacks a source because of the similarity between the views of someone making an argument and other proponents of the argument.\n\nThis form of the argument is as follows:\n\nAn example of this fallacy could be \"My opponent for office just received an endorsement from the Puppy Haters Association. Is that the sort of person you would want to vote for?\"\n\nWhen a statement is challenged by making an \"ad hominem\" attack on its author, it is important to draw a distinction between whether the statement in question was \"an argument\" or \"a statement of fact\" (\"testimony\"). In the latter case the issues of the credibility of the person making the statement may be crucial.\n\nDoug Walton, Canadian academic and author, has argued that \"ad hominem\" reasoning is not always fallacious, and that in some instances, questions of personal conduct, character, motives, etc., are legitimate and relevant to the issue, as when it directly involves hypocrisy, or actions contradicting the subject's words.\n\nThe philosopher Charles Taylor has argued that \"ad hominem\" reasoning (discussing facts about the speaker or author relative to the value of his statements) is essential to understanding certain moral issues due to the connection between individual persons and morality (or moral claims), and contrasts this sort of reasoning with the apodictic reasoning (involving facts beyond dispute or clearly established) of philosophical naturalism.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "631934", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=631934", "title": "Applied anthropology", "text": "Applied anthropology\n\nApplied anthropology refers to the application of the method and theory of anthropology to the analysis and solution of practical problems. In \"Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application\", Kedia and Van Willigen define the process as a \"complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy\". More simply, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. \n\nThe American Anthropological Association (AAA) website describes anthropology as a focus on \"the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as the humanities and physical sciences.\" Thus, the field is divided into four subareas: sociocultural anthropology, biological (or physical) anthropology, archaeology, and linguistic anthropology. Because a central tenet of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an \"applied anthropologist\". Indeed, some practical problems may invoke all sub-disciplines. For example, a Native American community development program may involve archaeological research to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore language competence among inhabitants, medical anthropology to determine the causality of dietary deficiency diseases, etc.\n\nApplied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as governments, development agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), tribal and ethnic associations, advocacy groups, social-service and educational agencies, and businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy projects, and even new specialized NGOs.\n\nApplied anthropologist methodology includes, but is not limited to, ethnography, participant observation, snowballing, interviews, and focus groups. They also use textual analysis, surveying, archival research, and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.\n\nThe process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge in attempts to ameliorate the lives of research participants can be problematic, and is often laced with elements of Orientalism and/or colonialism. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: \"The ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied.\" The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy, ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p. 16). \n\nAlthough guidelines for ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth by major anthropological organizations—including the American Anthropological Association (AAA), the Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)—it is increasingly difficult to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be an advocate, cultural \"broker\", evaluator, policy researcher, public participation specialist, and research analyst. \n\nThe multinational phenomenon of female genital cutting (FGC) exemplifies the necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: \"The work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum (1996) notes that analyses that \"do\" offer emic interpretations and cultural contextualizations are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice\" [emphasis in original]. In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations in an attempt to \"remedy\" a complex social issue.\n\nThe field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued debate about the essentiality of objectivity in anthropological fieldwork. Some hermeneutic scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one's own preconceived cultural notions from one's work. In this line of thought, it is more productive to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers, and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In contrast, the positivist approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for \nan objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.\n\nThe premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called \"Human Organization\", published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called \"Anthropology in Action\".\n\nUnder the directorship of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Jonathan Benthall (author of \"The Best of Anthropology Today\") created the annual Lucy Mair Medal of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology \"for the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity\".\n\nThe Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists known as \"Apply\". Within the European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA), there is the Applied Anthropology Network, which annually organises the international symposium Why the World Needs Anthropologists. Theme of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam, 2013), of the second Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), of the third Burning Issues of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), of the fourth Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), of the fifth Powering the Planet (Durham, 2017), and of the sixth Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA Medical Anthropology Network, there is also an applied anthropology special interest group.\n\nThere are three primary groups based out of the US that are founded on the application of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8335209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8335209", "title": "Chunchucmil", "text": "Chunchucmil\n\nChunchucmil was once a large, sprawling pre-Columbian Maya city located in the western part of what is now the state of Yucatán, Mexico.\n\nAlthough the famous explorer and author John Lloyd Stephens traveled within a few kilometers of Chunchucmil during his historic journey across the Yucatán Peninsula (he even met with the owner of the nearby haciendas), the archaeological site went relatively unnoticed by Maya scholars for more than a century because virtually no monuments (stelae) or other grand sculptures have been found there. The lack of royal monuments, combined with other archaeological data, may indicate that Chunchucmil was not a city ruled by a single divine king, as most other Maya polities. Instead, it may have been a commercial center, organized by various lineages and focused upon funneling goods between regions—such as the trade between the Gulf of Mexico and the interior of the Yucatán Peninsula.\n\nChunchucmil was most populous in the Middle Classical Period (400-650 AD), \n\nThe site center is located ca. 27 km (16.8 mi) inland from the Gulf of Mexico and approximately halfway between the coast and the next largest archaeological site of Oxkintok. It was named in the late 1970s after the nearest modern settlement (the Hacienda and village of Chunchucmil), however the archaeological site is so large that it extends onto the ejido lands of at least five modern communities: Chunchucmil, Kochol, San Mateo, Coahuila and Halachó. The majority of the ancient Maya site is located within the municipality of Maxcanú, however a portion of it is situated on land pertaining to the municipality of Halachó.\n\nThe site of Chunchucmil is located on a narrow band of semi-arid terrain that parallels portions of the western and northern coastlines in Yucatán and Campeche. This particular environmental zone is considered the driest in all of the Maya area, with less than 800 mm (31.5 in) of annual rainfall. Compounding these harsh conditions, nearly fifty percent of the surface around Chunchucmil is exposed limestone bedrock. Even when soils are encountered, they are rarely more than a few centimeters in depth. Vegetation in this region is generally considered scrub forest dominated by acacia and other drought-resistant species (similar to the European heathland). One of the mysteries surrounding Chunchucmil is how such a large city could have sustained itself in one of the poorest regions for agriculture.\n\nHowever, the ancient city was situated at the edge of this semi-arid ecological zone, exactly where the dry Yucatecan plains dip and fracture into vast wetlands (see map). Immediately to the west of Chunchucmil are found the seasonally inundated savannas, fresh water \"petenes\" (or \"ojos de agua\"), and eventually the brackish mangrove estuary where the Yucatán aquifer empties into the Gulf of Mexico near the ancient Maya coastal site of Canbalam. It is likely that ancient Chunchucmil was purposefully situated to take advantage of multiple ecological zones, including coastal resources such as the salt-beds of the Celestún peninsula, and to increase accessibility to the vigorous circum-peninsular canoe trade route of Pre-Columbian times, using Canbalam as its port of entry.\n\nThe term \"Chunchucmil\" was originally used to name a freshwater well (\"Ch'en Chun Chukum\"), the central water source for the cattle ranch that eventually grew to become the historic henequen hacienda of Chunchucmil. Most wells in this region are named after animals or plants. In this case, the words \"Ch'en Chun Chukum\" literally mean \"the well at the base of the Chukum tree\" (\"Havardia albicans\"). Local Maya speakers still refer to the modern village of Chunchucmil as \"Chun Chukum\" when speaking in their native tongue. The ancient Maya archaeological site was given the name Chunchucmil by archaeologists in the 1970s because that was the closest modern community to the site center. Local Maya villagers today do not have a single term to refer to the ruins, since the ancient city is so large that it encompasses most of their lands.\n\nThe exact size of Chunchucmil is currently being studied using aerial photography, satellite imagery, and survey transects by the Pakbeh Regional Economy Project (who have been working at Chunchucmil since the mid-1990s, under the direction of Dr. Bruce H. Dahlin). Estimates range from 25 km² for the more compact urban settlement to around 64 km² for the city and its adjoining suburbs and farmsteads. In either case, this places the site of Chunchucmil among some of the largest and most densely settled ancient Maya polities.\n\nCeramic data indicate that the Chunchucmil region was occupied from the Middle Preclassic (Middle Formative) through the Postclassic periods of Maya prehistory. However, widespread test excavations within the architectural groups of ancient Chunchucmil indicate that the city reached its apogee during the latter part of the Early Classic and the early part of the Late Classic, attaining its maximum spatial extent, population, and structural density. This period is defined in some areas as the \"Middle Classic.\" Chunchucmil appears to have gone into decline during the latter part of the Late Classic. The Terminal Classic (or Puuc) occupation at Chunchucmil is ephemeral at best, and the Postclassic occupation at the site consisted of squatter-like settlement. A few early colonial homesteads have been found, but the region was largely abandoned between the Maya Postclassic period and the beginnings of the cattle ranches and henequen haciendas of historic and modern times.\n\nThe Classic Period site center of Chunchucmil is dominated by over a dozen pyramids ranging in height from 8 to 18 m (26 to 60 ft) tall. Each pyramid is part of a structural arrangement referred to as a “quadrangle group” by members of the Pakbeh Regional Economy Project. Quadrangle groups consist of an enclosed courtyard flanked by a pyramid on one side (which faces inward towards the courtyard) and a number of ranged and compact structures along the remaining three sides. Within each quadrangle group's courtyard is a small central platform that is interpreted as a focal point of ritualized activities (such as an altar). Other ceremonies would have taken place within the temples atop each pyramid. With the temple pyramids and central platforms acting as loci of lineage-based ritual, quadrangle groups likely housed the upper-echelon elites of ancient Chunchucmil that may have been active in the socio-political, ideological and economic administration of the city. Of particular importance is the fact that each major quadrangle group is connected to the others through a network of sacbeob (stone causeways), suggesting an unknown degree of connectedness between the residing lineages and (potentially) cooperation or competition in ruling Chunchucmil. If this was indeed the case, Chunchucmil's political structure may have been roughly analogous to that suggested for the later Maya capital of Chichen Itza, referred to as a \"multepal\" system and characterized as rulership through council.\n\nResidential architecture at Chunchucmil often follows the same pattern as the large quadrangle groups, with structures arranged on four sides of a small plaza. This arrangement conforms to the \"patio cluster\" or \"patio group\" model for Maya residential organization, where two or more structures, potentially housing multiple family units, face a shared patio or courtyard.\n\nMany residential groups had a small temple or shrine (similar to the placement of the temple pyramids of their larger counterparts). These buildings served as loci for the performance of household rituals or other types of ideological practices. One such residential shrine that has been excavated and consolidated at the Lool Group revealed its form to be \"talud-tablero\". This style of architecture is most famous at sites in Central Mexico, such as at the contemporaneous city of Teotihuacan. Beneath the stair of this shrine was a vessel that also replicated the pottery of that Central Mexican city. While this should not be used as evidence of direct Teotihuacan influence, it does suggest Chunchucmil's participation in the greater Mesoamerican communication sphere at the time of Teotihuacan's dominance. It should also be noted that all other structures excavated at Chunchucmil thus far lack demonstrable Teotihuacan influence.\n\nOne of the distinguishing characteristics of Chunchucmil is its network of stone-lined paths. As mentioned above, the majority of residential lots are surrounded by albarradas (stone walls) that, when viewed on a map, give the site a honeycomb appearance. The space between adjacent albarradas form avenues or paths for foot traffic (called \"callejuelas\", see photo) that radiate outward from the site center and into Chunchucmil's dense residential zone. By mapping these formations, researchers have been able to better understand the flow of traffic in and out of the site center as well as the relationship between Chunchucmil's central core, its residential urban sprawl, and its outlying peripheral settlement.\n\nBeyond Chunchucmil, in the seasonally inundated western wetlands, researchers have found a network of rock alignments that connect Chunchucmil's periphery to other outlying settlements. Such rock alignments, called \"andadores\" by Maya archaeologists, would have provided sure footing through the wetlands, like stepping stones, leading travelers to various towns and resources in Chunchucmil's hinterland. While not all of these andadores have been followed to their final destinations, the general orientation of the longest alignments suggest that they may have functioned to connect Chunchucmil with the coast near Canbalam.\n\nOne of the first features of Chunchucmil to gain widespread attention was a stone wall, visible in aerial photos taken by the Atlas project, that roughly encircles 350,000 square metres of the site center (including most of the major Quadrangle Groups). Early reconnaissance by the Pakbeh Regional Economy Project in the late 1990s found that the wall, which stood between 1 and 1.5 m tall and had a perimeter of 1.8 km, was incomplete. It formed a large \"C\" shape with a 340 m wide gap open to the west (see map). Further mapping and excavation revealed that the wall runs above every major feature at the ancient site (crossing sacbeob', albarradas, and many residential groups). Based upon the law of superposition (an archaeological concept borrowed from the field of geology), this meant that the large barricade was likely the last feature to be built at the site. Furthermore, the stones used to create the barricade were clearly robbed from nearby structures (rather than freshly quarried). Given this data, it has been hypothesized that the barricade was constructed rapidly at the end of Chunchucmil's history, possibly to protect the remaining inhabitants from an invasion that arrived before the wall could be completed, leading to the ultimate demise of the ancient city.\n\nThe chipped-stone assemblage of Chunchucmil is dominated by obsidian prismatic blades. The prismatic blade industry was ubiquitous throughout Mesoamerica and primarily used in the production of obsidian tools. Lithic analyses have determined that the majority of the blades at Chunchucmil were likely imported in finished form, as suggested by the general scarcity of polyhedral cores, production debitage, rejuvenation artifacts, and manufacturing errors at the site. Other types of tools made from obsidian, especially formal bifacial tools, are rare, but present, at Chunchucmil. Bifacial obsidian tools include a small collection of projectile points and ambiguous tool fragments. Unifacial tools are generally absent. Other types of industries, such as expedient flake production or bipolar reduction, are also absent at Chunchucmil.\n\nThe exploitation of non-obsidian stone resources (e.g., chert, chalcedony, and quartz) did occur at Chunchucmil, but these materials are much less common than obsidian. The majority of these resources, especially chert, were obtained locally from nodules in the limestone bedrock, but were very poor in quality. While a number of formal tools were produced from chert and quartz, most non-obsidian tools were informal and produced through expedient flake production.\n\nThe fact that obsidian was favored over local resources for utilitarian tools is interesting, especially considering that obsidian had to be imported over long distances. The El Chayal obsidian source (which is the most common at Chunchucmil), is located nearly 1000 km (621 mi) away (as the crow flies) in Guatemala. This, once again, indicates Chunchucmil's close ties with external trade routes and the greater Mesoamerican world of the Classic period.\n\nThe site of Chunchucmil is also notable for the likely presence of a marketplace. Geochemical soil tests combined with careful excavations of an open area in the site center have revealed a possible market for distributing comestibles and other goods. Excavations also revealed ephemeral stone alignments that may have been brace foundations for perishable market stall walls. High levels of phosphorus correlate with these alignments, suggesting high concentrations of organic decay. Additionally, the distribution of obsidian within the Chunchucmil region itself, especially among a variety of sociocultural contexts, may also indicate the presence of a market economy, which is relatively rare among Early Classic Maya economies.\n\nAs mentioned above, one important question concerning ancient Chunchucmil is how such a large population could have survived in one of the poorest areas for agriculture. According to bone isotope studies conducted by Pakbeh Regional Economy Project member Geni Mansell, the diet of the ancient inhabitants may have been more diversified than in other areas of the Maya region. When compared with skeletal remains from other parts of Yucatán, Belize and the southern Maya lowlands, human remains from Chunchucmil indicate that their diet included significantly less corn (\"maize\", the staple crop for most communities in the Maya area). Access to the more ecologically diverse wetlands and coastal resources, as well as access to inter-regional trade routes and a centralized marketplace, may have been critical to ancient subsistence at Chunchucmil.\n\n\n\n"}

This process involves learning about and accepting traditions, heritage, language, religion, ancestry, aesthetics, thinking patterns, and social structures of a culture. Normally, people internalize the beliefs, values, norms, and social practices of their culture and identify themselves with that culture. The culture becomes a part of their self-concept (Lustig, 2013). However, some studies have noted that existing cultural identity theory may not account for the fact that different individuals and groups may not react to or interpret events, happenings, attitudes, etc. in the same ways as other individuals or groups.\n\nMyron Lustig notes that cultural identities are central to a person’s sense of self. That is because cultural identities “are central, dynamic, and multifaceted components of one’s self concept” (Lustig, 133). Lustig also points out that cultural identities are dynamic, and they exist within a changing social context. As a result, a person’s identity changes as do one’s ongoing experiences in life (Lustig, 135). Other researchers describe cultural identity as referring to the content of values as guiding principles, to meaningful symbols, and to life styles that individuals share with others, though not necessarily within recognizable groups (Boski et al., 2004). In addition, Boski et al. point out that most books and studies have ignored cultural identity as a theoretical construct in the field of cross-cultural psychology. Instead, books and journals report works on the theme of social identity. Social identity is described as a sense of “We-ness,” or attachment to a group that one is a member of, and by comparison to others. The sense of “We-ness” remains culturally empty, however. Even with natural groups, it is portrayed in trait-attributes, “which is not different from those used to characterize individuals” (Boski et al., 2004). There is, however, research evidence about the social (ethnic) vs. cultural distinction (Sanchez-Burks et al., 2000). This study found that the task-oriented cultural style was generally more favored than the task-plus interpersonal alternative, particularly among Anglo-American participants, for whom ethnicity did not matter. Mexican and Latino participants, however, showed some degree of favoritism toward ethnically similar participants (Sanchez-Burks et all, 2000).\n\nIt seems that there are different viewpoints regarding cultural and social identities. Cultural identity is defined as the identity of a group or culture or of an individual as far as one is influenced by one’s belonging to a group or culture. Further, Cultural identity is similar to, and overlaps with, identity politics. New forms of identification have been suggested to break down the understanding of the individual as a whole subject into a collection of various cultural identifiers. Such identifiers can result from various conditions including: location, gender, race, history, nationality, language, sexuality, religious beliefs, ethnicity, aesthetics, and even food. In places like the U.S. and Canada, where the people are ethnically diverse, social unity is primarily based on common social values and beliefs. However, some critics of cultural identity declare that cultural identity based upon difference is a divisive force in society. In addition, cultural identity may be defined by the social network of people imitating and following the social norms as presented by the media. Therefore, instead of learning behavior and knowledge from cultural or religious groups, people may be learning social norms from the media to build on their cultural identity. Language may also be an important factor in culture identity. The communication that comes with sharing a language promotes connections and roots to ancestors and cultural histories.\n\nBoski, P., Strus, K. & Tiaga. E. (2004).

Significantly, Eclecticism hardly ever constituted a specific style in art: it is characterized by the fact that it was not a particular style. In general, the term describes the combination in a single work of a variety of influences—mainly of elements from different historical styles in architecture, painting, and the graphic and decorative arts. In music the term used may be either eclecticism or polystylism.\n\nThe term eclectic was first used by Johann Joachim Winckelmann to characterize the art of the Carracci, who incorporated in their paintings elements from the Renaissance and classical traditions.

They are \"concepts the proper use of which inevitably involves endless disputes about their proper uses on the part of their users\", and these disputes \"cannot be settled by appeal to empirical evidence, linguistic usage, or the canons of logic alone\".\n\nAlthough Gallie's term is widely used to denote imprecise use of technical terminology, it has a far more specific application. And, although the notion could be misleadingly and evasively used to justify \"agreeing to disagree\", the term offers something more valuable:\nSince its introduction by W.B. Gallie in 1956, the expression \"essentially contested concept\" has been treated both as a challenge and as an excuse by social theorists. It has been treated as a challenge in that theorists consider their uses of terms and concepts to be in competition with the uses advocated by other theorists, each theorist trying to be deemed the champion. It has been treated as an excuse in that, rather than acknowledge that the failure to reach agreement is due to such factors as imprecision, ignorance, or belligerence, instead theorists point to the terms and concepts under dispute and insist that they are always open to contest — that they are terms and concepts about which we can never expect to reach agreement.\n\nThe disputes that attend an essentially contested concept are driven by substantive disagreements over a range of different, entirely reasonable (although perhaps mistaken) interpretations of a mutually-agreed-upon archetypical notion, such as the legal precept \"treat like cases alike; and treat different cases differently\", with \"each party [continuing] to defend its case with what it claims to be convincing arguments, evidence and other forms of justification\".\n\nGallie speaks of how \"This picture is painted in oils\" can be successfully contested if the work is actually painted in tempera; while \"This picture is a work of art\" may meet strong opposition due to disputes over what \"work of art\" denotes. He suggests three avenues whereby one might resolve such disputes:\nOtherwise, the dispute probably centres on polysemy.\nHere, a number of critical questions must be asked:\n\nClarke has made a valuable contribution to the overall debate by suggesting that, in order to determine whether a particular dispute was a consequence of true polysemy or inadvertent homonymy, one should seek to \"locate the source of the dispute\".\n\nThis source might be \"within the concept itself\", or \"[within] some underlying non-conceptual disagreement between the contestants\".\n\nClarke then drew attention to the substantial differences between the expressions \"essentially contested\" and \"essentially contestable\", that were being extensively used within the literature as though they were interchangeable.\n\nClarke argued that to state that a concept is merely \"contested\" is to \"attribute significance to the contest rather than to the concept\". Yet, to state that a concept is \"contestable\" is to \"attribute some part of any contest to the concept\". In other words, this is \"to claim that some feature or property of the concept makes it polysemantic, and that the concept contains some internal conflict of ideas\"; and it is this fact that provides the \"essentially contested concept\" with its \"inherent potential\" for \"generating disputes\".\n\nIn 1956 Gallie proposed a set of seven conditions for the existence of an essentially contested concept. Gallie was very specific about the limits of his enterprise: it dealt exclusively with abstract, qualitative notions, such as \"art\", \"religion\", \"science\", \"democracy\", and \"social justice\" (and, if Gallie’s choices are contrasted with negatively regarded concepts such as \"evil\", \"disease\", \"superstition\", etc., it is clear that the concepts he chose were exclusively positively regarded).\n\nFreeden remarks that \"not all essentially contested concepts signify valued achievements; they may equally signify disapproved and denigrated phenomena\", and Gerring asks us to imagine just how difficult it would be to \"[try] to craft definitions of slavery, fascism, terrorism, or genocide without recourse to 'pejorative' attributes\".\n\nThese features distinguish Gallie's \"essentially contested concepts\" from others, \"which can be shown, as a result of analysis or experiment, to be radically confused\"; or, as Gray would have it, they are the features that relate to the task of distinguishing the \"general words, which really denote an essentially contested concept\" from those other \"general words, whose uses conceal a diversity of distinguishable concepts\":\n\n\nScholars such as H. L. A. Hart, John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, and Steven Lukes have variously embellished Gallie's proposal by arguing that certain of the difficulties encountered with Gallie’s proposition may be due a consequence of the unintended conflation of two separate domains associated with the term \"concept\":\n\nIn essence, Hart (1961), Rawls (1971), Dworkin (1972), and Lukes (1974) distinguished between the \"unity\" of a notion and the \"multiplicity\" of its possible instantiations.\n\nFrom their work it is easy to understand the issue as one of determining whether there is a single notion that has a number of different instantiations, or whether there is more than one notion, each of which is reflected in a different \"usage\".\n\nIn a section of his 1972 article in \"The New York Review of Books\", Dworkin used the example of \"fairness\" to isolate and elaborate the difference between a \"concept\" (\"suum cuique\") and its \"conception\" (various instantiations, for example utilitarian ethics).\n\nHe supposes that he has instructed his children not to treat others \"unfairly\" and asks us to recognize that, whilst he would have undoubtedly had particular \"examples\" (of the sorts of conduct he was intending to discourage) in mind at the time he spoke to his children, whatever it was that he \"meant\" when he issued such instructions was not confined to those \"examples\" alone, for two reasons:\n\n\nDworkin argues that this admission of error would not entail any \"change\" to his original instructions, because the true \"meaning\" of his instructions was that \"[he] meant the family to be guided by the \"concept\" of fairness, not by any specific \"conception\" of fairness [that he] might have had in mind\". Therefore, he argues, his instructions do, in fact, \"cover\" this new case.\nExploring what he considers to be the \"crucial distinction\" between the overall \"concept\" of \"fairness\" and some particular, and specific \"conception\" of \"fairness\", he asks us to imagine a group whose members share the view that certain acts are \"unfair\".\n\nThe members of this group \"agree on a great number of standard cases of unfairness and use these as benchmarks against which to test other, more controversial cases\".\n\nIn these circumstances, says Dworkin, \"the group has a \"concept\" of unfairness, and its members may appeal to that concept in moral instruction or argument.\"\n\nHowever, the members may still disagree over many of these \"controversial cases\"; and differences of this sort indicate that members \"have\", or \"act upon\", entirely different theories of why and how each of the \"standard cases\" are, in fact, genuine acts of \"unfairness\".\n\nAnd, because each considers that certain principles \"[which] must be relied upon to show that a particular division or attribution is unfair\" are far a more \"fundamental\" sort of principle than certain other principles, it can be said that members of the group have different \"conceptions\" of \"fairness\".\n\nConsequently, those responsible for giving \"instructions\", and those responsible for setting \"standards\" of \"fairness\", in this community may be doing one of two things:\n\nIt is important to recognize that rather than it just being a case of delivering two different instructions; it is a case of delivering two different \"kinds\" of instruction:\n\nAs a consequence, according to Dworkin, whenever an appeal is made to \"fairness\", a moral issue is raised; and, whenever a conception of \"fairness\" is laid down, an attempt is being made to answer that moral issue.\n\nWhilst Gallie's expression \"essentially contested concepts\" precisely denotes those \"essentially questionable and corrigible concepts\" which \"are permanently and essentially subject to revision and question\", close examination of the wide and varied and imprecise applications of Gallie's term subsequent to 1956, by those who have ascribed their own literal meaning to Gallie's term without ever consulting Gallie's work, have led many philosophers to conclude that \"essentially disputed concepts\" would have been far better choice for Gallie's meaning, for at least three reasons:\n\n\nJeremy Waldron's research has revealed that Gallie's notion has \"run wild\" in the law review literature over the ensuing 60 years and is now being used to denote something like \"very hotly contested, with no resolution in sight\", due to an entirely mistaken view that the \"essential\" in Gallie's term is an \"intensifier\", when, in fact, \"[Gallie's] term 'essential' refers to the location of the disagreement or indeterminacy; it is contestation at the core, not just at the borderlines or penumbra of a concept\".\n\nYet is also clear that \"if the notion of logical justification can be applied only to such theses and arguments as can be presumed capable of gaining in the long run universal agreement, the disputes to which the uses of any essentially contested concept give rise are not genuine or rational disputes at all\" (Gallie, 1956a, p. 188).\n\nThus, Gallie argued:\n\nSo long as contestant users of any essentially contested concept believe, however deludedly, that their own use of it is the only one that can command honest and informed approval, they are likely to persist in the hope that they will ultimately persuade and convert all their opponents by logical means. But once [we] let the truth out of the bag — i.e., the essential contestedness of the concept in question — then this harmless if deluded hope may well be replaced by a ruthless decision to cut the cackle, to damn the heretics and to exterminate the unwanted.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10809813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10809813", "title": "Global feminism", "text": "Global feminism\n\nGlobal feminism is a feminist theory closely aligned with post-colonial theory and postcolonial feminism. It concerns itself primarily with the forward movement of women's rights on a global scale. Using different historical lenses from the legacy of colonialism, global feminists adopt global causes and start movements which seek to dismantle what they argue are the currently predominant structures of global patriarchy. Global feminism is also known as world feminism and international feminism.\n\nTwo historical examples Global Feminists might use to expose patriarchal structures at work in colonized groups or societies are medieval Spain (late eleventh to thirteenth centuries) and nineteenth-century Cuba. The former example concerns women of the \"Mudejar\" communities of Islamic Spain and the strict sexual codes through which their social activity was regulated. \"Mudejar\" women could be sold into slavery as a result of sexual activity with a Christian man; this was to escape the deemed punishment. Because of their simultaneous roles as upholding one's family honor and one of \"conquered status and gender\", \"\"Mudejar\" women suffered double jeopardy in their sexual contact with Christians [in Spain]\".\n\nNineteenth-century Cuba can be looked at as an example of colonialism and neocolonialism working together in a slave-based society to affect women's lives under patriarchy, where Cuba \"remained a Spanish colony while enduring a neocolonial relationship with the United States\". Havana, a city noted for its \"absence of the female form\", had, \"of all the major cities in the West...the most strict social restrictions on the female portion of its population\". Upper-class Cuban women were \"a constant visual reminder of the separation between elite white society and the people of color they ruled\".\n\nForced commitment to double shifts, struggle for individual autonomy, and blurring the private and public sphere of labor are all additional concerns to the primary issue for migrant women, which is the right to motherhood. The phenomena of motherhood in a transnational and contemporary time creates structural constraints for migrant women. Abusive employers and intimate violence is not the only problem these women have to face, but there are structural issues regarding the right to motherhood in this transnational era. Women immigrants leave their chance overseas at an idealized motherhood of watching their children grow up while performing their gender role, and deport to be the breadwinner. The restructuring of care from the effects of globalization and neoliberalism institutionalizes these women.\n\nGlobalization is constantly changing and as a result it is supporting the phenomena of women in the global south migrating to developed countries to serve domestic labors. The role of transnational mothering within a neoliberal spectrum affects the exploitation of women through the deprivation of their citizen rights, by extracting the benefits of immigrant's labor while minimizing or eliminating any obligations, whether social or fiscal to the society or state. Migrant women of Third World countries are not drawn from their countries to the advancing economy of the First World, rather drawn from their economies that have been disrupted and distorted by Western colonial incursions, leaving many to be torn free of their roots and recruited to countries to fill its non permanent labor needs, preventing competition with native workers; fulfilling the complementary void. Transnational mothering is viewed as an accommodation for both classes.\n\nMotherhood, along with reproductive freedom and marriage, is the fundamental right of women but is prohibited by nations that justify foreign domestic services, as much as view immigrant women as a threat to its nationalism. Nations create a process of racial formation through which women of different national and racial identities experience discrepant integration within a society, ultimately contributing to hierarchies of citizenship. In relation to social Darwinism, natives believe that Third World migrants \"just can't make it\", and fear degeneration, thus nations try to weed out those who do not fit the upper or middle class society in ways such as sterilization; e.g.; black women are identified as devious, immoral, domineering, sexually promiscuous, and bad mothers, resulting in their reproductive rights being threatened by regulation.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8599035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8599035", "title": "La Amelia", "text": "La Amelia\n\nLa Amelia is a Pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site near Itzan, in the lower Pasión River region of the Petén Department of Guatemala. It formed a polity in the Late Classic (AD 600 to 830), and was involved in the war between Tikal and Calakmul followed, in 650, by La Amelia's takeover by Dos Pilas. Two centuries of intermittent warfare followed until the area's population was so diminished by about 830, that this is considered the beginning of abandonment of Classic sites in the region.\nLa Amelia is located on a series of low hills in the municipality of Sayaxché, south of La Florida and the Pasión River. The site sits at a level of above mean sea level. The low-lying areas around the hills are prone to flooding. The main site area is maintained as a forest park by the nearby village of San Francisco El Tumbo. More than 90 percent of the mounds at the site have been looted.\n\nLa Amelia was a subordinate site in the Classic Period Petexbatún kingdom of Mutal that was first ruled from Dos Pilas and then from Aguateca. The site is located to the northwest of Dos Pilas, and may have originally been called B'ahlam. The rapidly expanding Dos Pilas kingdom conquered La Amelia in the early 8th century. The occupational history of La Amelia appears to have been brief and limited to the Late Classic.\n\nIn AD 802 the last known ruler of the kingdom, Tan Te' K'inich, supervised a ritual conducted by the ruler of La Amelia, Lachan K'awiil Ajaw Bot, the last reference anywhere to Tan Te' K'inich. Lachan K'awiil Ajaw Bot, the local La Amelia king, is depicted on La Amelia Panel 2, dated to AD 804 and continued to raise monuments at the site, the last of which that can be dated was erected in 807 and contains the last reference to the Petexbatún kingdom of Mutal. Lachan K'awiil Ajaw Bot is also mentioned on Panel 1 and Hieroglyphic Stairway 1 at the site. He is known to have been born on 25 June 760 and to have been enthroned on 1 May 802.\n\nLa Amelia was abandoned some time in the middle of the 9th century AD.\n\nThe Carnegie Institution carried out investigations at the site in 1937. That project documented several carved stone monuments, and created a partial site map which was published by Sylvanus Morley in his 1938 volume \"The Inscriptions of Peten\". Yale University carried out further investigations from 1984 to 1986.\n\nA mapping and excavation project was conducted at the site by the La Amelia Archaeological Project in 1997. That work was directed by Dr. Antonia Foias of Williams College. During the summer 1997 field season, the La Amelia Archaeological Project completed mapping of the central site area and excavated several test units.\n\nLa Amelia is a small site covering an area of approximately . The site is divided into four groups, two of which have monumental architecture, and a further 13 smaller residential groups. The 1997 mapping project recorded a total of 71 structures at the site. The central plaza area appears to have been focused around the \"Group of the Three Pyramids\" in the southern portion of the site. That group included three pyramids of between in height, all of which have been severely damaged by looter trenches.\n\nThe \"Group of the Hieroglyphic Stairway\" is situated north of the main plaza, in the northwest quadrant of the site, and was constructed principally by terracing and flattening the summit of a natural hill. This group exhibits three frontal terraces, and an interior courtyard on the summit which is surrounded by six narrow range structures. Access to the lowest terrace is achieved via a 5-step monolithic stairway featuring limestone blocks carved with glyphs and scenes. Two carved panels (called alternately Stela 1 and Panel 2) originally decorated the front of the structure to either side of the stairway.\n\nWhen Edwin M. Shook of the Carnegie Institution first documented the site of La Amelia in 1937, he noted the presence of six hieroglyphic blocks which functioned as risers along the uppermost level of the monolithic stairway. This led him to identify the Hieroglyphic Stairway at the site, and to name the associated architectural group accordingly. A seventh carved block was recovered in 1997 from a test unit excavated on the plaza immediately southwest of the staircase.\n\nThree of the carved stones from the Hieroglyphic Stairway were entirely glyphic, while the four remaining stones (including the one recovered in 1997) feature reclining male figures along with short texts. Stephen Houston documented one of the three glyphic stones, although no record exists of the other two. Shook sketched the three steps he saw that depicted human figures, but did not include any details regarding the glyphic texts on those stones. None of the six steps recorded by Shook remained \"in situ\" by 1997, and their ultimate disposition is unknown.\n\nThe four carved steps featuring human figures from the Hieroglyphic Stairway at La Amelia all display images of simply-dressed males, who were likely ancestors of the site's ruler. All four of these figures hold heads or masks of God K. The panel discovered in 1997 included a Calendar Round date of 2 Caban 2 Muan, and an associated text describing a ritual involving God K which took place on that date. The emblem glyph for the figure on this panel may be that of Tamarindito.\n\nThe carved panels which originally flanked the Hieroglyphic Stairway at La Amelia depict dancing rulers in full ceremonial costume, as well as glyphic texts. A lower register on each monument depicts a reclining jaguar which looks up at the dancing ruler. Panel 2 records a date of AD 804 and depicts the ruler Lachan K'awiil Ajaw Bot dressed as a ballplayer. Panel 2 now resides in front of the Mayor's building in Sayaxché. Stela 1 was originally located west of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and records a date of AD 807. Stela 1 now resides at the National Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology in Guatemala City.\n"}

Debates about this topic are mainly focused on the extent to which language influences spatial cognition or if it does at all. Research also concerns differences between perspectives on spatial relations across cultures, what these imply, and the exploration of potentially partaking cognitive mechanisms.\n\nResearch shows that frames of reference for spatial cognition differ across cultures and that language could play a crucial role in structuring these different frames.\nThree types of perspectives on space can be distinguished:\nLanguages like English or Dutch do not exclusively make use of relative descriptions but these appear to be most frequent compared to intrinsic or absolute descriptions. An absolute frame of reference is usually restricted to large scale geographical descriptions in these languages. Speakers of the Australian languages Arrernte, Guugu Yimithirr, and Kuuk Thaayore only use absolute descriptions.\nThe relative and intrinsic perspectives seem to be connected as there is no known language which applies only one of these frames of reference exclusively.\n\n(1.) It has been argued that people universally use an egocentric representation to solve non-linguistic spatial tasks which would align with the relative frame of reference.\n(2.) Other researchers have proposed that people apply multiple frames of reference during their daily lives and that languages reflect these cognitive structures.\nIn the light of the current body of literature the second view seems to be the more plausible one.\n\nThe dominant frames of reference have found to be reflected in the common types of gesticulation in the respective language. Speakers of absolute languages would typically represent an object moving north with a hand movement towards the north. Whereas speakers of relative languages typically depict a movement of an object to the right with a hand movement to the right, independent of the direction they are facing during speech. Speakers of intrinsic languages would, for example, typically represent human movement from the perspective of the mover with a sagittal hand gesture away from the speaker.\n\nA study by Boroditsky and Gaby compared speakers of an absolute language—Pormpuraawans—with English speakers. The task on which they compared them consisted of the spatial arrangement of cards which showed a temporal progression. The result was that the speakers of the relative language (Americans) exclusively chose to represent time spatially as progressing from left (earlier time) to right (later time). Whereas the Pormpuraawans took the direction they faced into account and preferred to depict time as progressing from east (earlier time) to west (later time) the most.\n\nConfounding variables could potentially explain a significant proportion of the measured difference in performance between the linguistic frames of reference. \nThese can be categorized into three types of confounding factors:\n\nGentner, Özyürek, Gürcanli, and Goldin-Meadow found that deaf children, who lacked a conventional language, did not use gestures to convey spatial relations (see home sign). Building on that, they showed that deaf children performed significantly worse on a task of spatial cognition compared to hearing children. They concluded that the acquisition of (spatial) language is an important factor in shaping spatial cognition.\n\nSeveral mechanisms accounting for or contributing to the possible effect of language on cognition have been suggested: \n"}
{"id": "42348559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42348559", "title": "Languages of Illinois", "text": "Languages of Illinois\n\nThe official language of Illinois is English. Nearly 80% of the population speak English natively, and most others speak it fluently as a second language. The forms of American English spoken in Illinois range from Inland Northern near Chicago and the northern part of the state, to Midland and Southern dialects further downstate. Illinois has speakers of many other languages, of which Spanish is by far the most widespread. Illinois's indigenous languages disappeared when the Indian population was deported under the policy of Indian Removal.\n\nEnglish is Illinois's official language. Illinois was one of the first states in America to pass an official language law, though its first official language was not English but \"American\". In 1923, Representative Washington J. McCormick of Montana had failed to pass a bill in the United States Congress declaring \"American\" to be the official language of the United States. Following the bill's failure, Senator Frank Ryan introduced a similar bill to the Illinois General Assembly. The bill passed with the support of Irish and Jewish politicians in Chicago, who, by rejecting the term \"English\", wanted to show their opposition to British policies in Ireland and Palestine, respectively. In 1969, another act of the General Assembly replaced \"American\" with \"English.\" Meanwhile, the term \"American language\" survives in some legislation from the period. Unlike official language laws in many other states, the statute in Illinois is purely symbolic, having the same status as laws naming state symbols like the state bird and state fossil.\n\nThe English of Illinois varies from Inland Northern in the northern part of the state, to Midland and Southern further south. The Northern Cities Vowel Shift is advanced in Chicago and its vicinity, and some features of the shift can be heard along The St. Louis Corridor, a southwestern extension of the NCVS stretching from the Chicago area to St. Louis. The distribution of dialect features reflects the origins of early English-speaking settlers: Inland Northern predominates in areas first settled by people from New England, New York, Pennsylvania, and Germany; Midland and Southern are spoken in areas settled by people from the southern United States. African American Vernacular English is also spoken in parts of the state.\n\nAs of 2010, 78.26% (9,315,206) of Illinois residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 12.74% (1,516,674) spoke Spanish, 1.64% (195,600) Polish, 0.67% (80,954) Chinese (which includes Cantonese and Mandarin), and 0.64% (75,754) Tagalog. In total, 21.74% (2,587,254) of Illinois's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English. Among those who speak a language other than English at home, most (57.3%) were reported in 2010 to speak English \"very well.\" 20.7% spoke English \"well,\" 15.9% spoke it \"not well,\" and only 6.2% \"not at all\".\n\nIn the colonial period, the Miami-Illinois language was spoken throughout the territory of the modern state. Jacques Gravier, a missionary at Starved Rock, wrote the first French-Illinois dictionary in 1700; Jean Le Boullenger wrote another in 1725. Other indigenous languages at the time of statehood in 1818 included Potawatomi, Sauk-Fox, and Ojibwe. These languages disappeared from Illinois when the U.S. carried out Indian Removal, culminating in the Black Hawk War of 1832 and the Second Treaty of Chicago in 1833.\n\nFrench was the language of colonial Illinois before 1763, and under British rule remained the most-spoken language in the main settlements of Cahokia and Kaskaskia. Many French speakers left Illinois after it came under U.S. control following the Illinois Campaign of 1778, but Illinois was still a bilingual territory for several more years before the flood of Anglo-American settlers overwhelmed the old communities. By the time of statehood in 1818, French was in decline for matters of politics and government. Colonial French died out in Illinois but survived as Missouri French in some communities across the Mississippi River. The 2010 census reported 34,938 French speakers in Illinois, 0.29% of the population.\n"}

He is also Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University, where he was Professor of International Relations since 1979 and Saif Ghobash Professor of Arab Studies since 1980 in the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service. While at Georgetown, Hudson served as Director of the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies intermittently for over twenty years, most recently from 2007 to 2010.\n\nMichael C. Hudson received his Bachelor of Arts from Swarthmore College in 1959 and his Master of Arts and Ph.D. in Political Science from Yale University in 1960 and 1964, respectively. In 1961, he received a Certificate in Arabic from Princeton University. While studying for his PhD at Yale, Hudson specialized in comparative politics and international relations with his advisor, the renowned political scientist Karl W. Deutsch. His dissertation was entitled \"Political Change in Lebanon: 1943-1963,\" which would be the basis for his first book \"The Precarious Republic: Political Modernization in Lebanon\".\n\nWhile conducting fieldwork in Lebanon for his doctoral dissertation, Hudson taught history at the American Community School in Beirut from 1962-1963. Also while completing his doctoral degree, he served as an instructor at Swarthmore College, from 1963-1964. Upon completing his studies at Yale University, Hudson became Assistant Professor at Brooklyn College at the City University of New York, from 1964-1968, and then an Associate Professor (tenured), from 1968-1970. In 1970, he became Associate Professor in the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at the Johns Hopkins University. He remained at SAIS until 1975, when he co-founded the Center for Contemporary Arab Studies (CCAS) at Georgetown University with a distinguished group of academics, including Hisham Sharabi, John Ruedy, Ibrahim Oweiss, Ambassador Clovis Maksoud, and Dean Peter F. Krogh. Hudson served as the director of CCAS from 1976-1989, and directed it again in 2000, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010.\n\nIn 2010, Hudson became the Director of the Middle East Institute (MEI) and Professor of Political Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Hudson was the first director of MEI, which was founded in 2007 as an autonomous research institute within NUS. He continues to direct MEI today. Hudson is also Professor Emeritus at Georgetown University.\n\nIn January 2015, he was appointed as the Kuwait Foundation Visiting Scholar at Harvard Kennedy School's Middle East Initiative. He is leading a study group at the Kennedy School on \"Rethinking the Arab State: The Collapse of Legitimacy in Arab Politics.\" \n\nDuring the course of his career, Hudson has served on numerous boards and committees related to the fields of political science and Middle East studies. He was a founding member of the Middle East Studies Association of North America, and served as President of the association from 1986-87. He has served on the editorial boards of the International Journal of Middle East Studies, the Journal of Arab Affairs, and Cambridge University Press's \"Middle East Library\" series. He has also served as a manuscript evaluator for over a dozen academic journals. He was a member of the Advisory Board of the National Council on US-Arab Relations and the Board of Trustees of the American Institute for Pakistan Studies. Furthermore, he has served as an external evaluator for Middle East studies programs at the University of Utah, the University of Virginia, and Kuwait University. He has also served on committees within the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies.\n\nIn addition to his distinguished record of establishing and directing premier centers for Middle East studies (CCAS and MEI), Hudson has been an authoritative scholar of contemporary Middle East politics. His most notable contributions are on the problem of political legitimacy in the Arab world, as set out in his seminal work \"Arab Politics: The Search for Legitimacy\". He has identified and explored the legitimacy 'deficits' of various Arab governments, focusing on cultural, institutional, and leadership sources of legitimacy. He argues that the question of participation is key to legitimacy, an issue borne out by the Arab uprisings beginning in 2011. Further, new information technologies and social media have invigorated civil societies in these countries.\n\nHudson has also contributed to the scholarship on politics in divided societies, U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, and regional integration and conflict in the Middle East. On politics in divided societies, he has taken Lebanon as an ongoing case study (see his book \"The Precarious Republic\"), critiquing the theory of consociationalism and advocating the deconstruction rather than the institutionalization of sectarianism in Lebanon and elsewhere in the region, despite the recent apparent resurgence of sectarian polarization. On U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Hudson contends that a Pax Americana for the Middle East is illusory, owing to the U.S.'s unbalanced approach to the Palestine-Israel conflict, the negative consequences of military interventions, and the failure to maintain soft power and capitalize on a legacy of good will. He asserts that \"Imperial America\" has been driven by dysfunctional domestic pressures and poor decision-making, and has lately suggested that the so-called \"American decline\" in the Middle East might not be a bad thing for all concerned. Dealing with questions of regional integration and conflict in the greater Middle East, Hudson has explored the interplay between 'rationalist' classical international relations theory approaches and 'sociological' approaches that focus on the domestic decision-making arena. Influenced in his academic training by Kenneth Waltz on the one hand and Karl W. Deutsch on the other, Hudson has argued against theoretical stovepiping; understanding integrative and conflict tendencies requires acknowledgement of Waltz's 'third image' approach as well as Deutsch's 'social mobilization approach.'\n\nAs a professor at Georgetown University and elsewhere, Hudson has taught courses on comparative politics, international politics, comparative politics of the Middle East, Middle East international politics, Lebanese politics, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli conflict, an introduction to social science, networked cultures and networked politics, Yemeni politics, U.S. policy in the Middle East, and politics in divided societies. Hudson is frequently consulted by news organizations for interviews and guest appearances to discuss political developments in the Middle East. Furthermore, he regularly contributes to the media through opinion editorials and short essays. Some of these outlets include \"Al-Jazeera English\", \"Jadaliyya\", \"Foreign Policy\", Singapore's \"Middle East Insights\", \"The Washington Post\", Lebanon's \"The Daily Star\" and \"Al-Mustaqbal\", the \"International Herald Tribune\", and others.\n\nMuch of Hudson's academic work has been supported by competitive grants and fellowships. These have included the Robert R. McCormick Fellowship from Yale University (1959–62), American Philosophical Society grants (1965 and 1968), the Harvard Center for International Affairs Fellowship (1965–66), a Guggenheim Fellowship (1975–76), and a Fulbright Senior Fellowship to Yemen in 1994. He has also been the recipient of various honors and awards for his academic and administrative contributions to Middle East studies, including the \"Jere L. Bacharach Service Award\" from the Middle East Studies Association in 2011.\n\nBooks \n\n\nScholarly Articles and Chapters \n\nHudson has published chapters in over thirty academic books, and written around sixty articles and thirty book reviews for academic journals and trade publications. These publications include \"MIddle East Policy\", \"PS: Political Science and Politics\", \"'Comparative Politics\", \"The Yale Law Journal\", \"Middle East Insight\", \"Middle East Journal\", \"Arab Studies Quarterly\", \"Journal of Refugee Studies\", \"International Negotiation\", \"Contention\", \"Current History\", \"Arab Studies Journal\", \"Third World Quarterly\", \"Journal of International Affairs,\" \"Journal of Palestine Studies\", and various Arabic-language publications, among others.\n"}
{"id": "883666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=883666", "title": "Monarchomachs", "text": "Monarchomachs\n\nThe Monarchomachs () were originally French Huguenot theorists who opposed monarchy at the end of the 16th century, known in particular for having theoretically justified tyrannicide. The term was originally a pejorative word coined in 1600 by the Scottish royalist and Catholic William Barclay (1548–1608) from the Greek μόναρχος (\"monarchos\" \"monarch, sole ruler\") and μάχομαι (\"makhomai\" the verb meaning \"to fight\"), meaning \"those who fight against monarchs\".\n\nBorn out of the French Wars of Religion, they were most active between 1573, a year after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, and 1584. The Monarchomachs pleaded in favour of a form of \"popular sovereignty\". Arguing for a sort of contract between the sovereign and the people, they have been considered as the precursors of social contract theories.\n\nThe Monarchomachs included jurists such as the Calvinists François Hotman (1524–1590), Théodore de Bèze (1519–1605), Simon Goulart (1543–1628), Nicolas Barnaud (1538–1604), Hubert Languet (1518–1581), Philippe de Mornay (1549–1623) and George Buchanan (1506–1582). Through the means of libels and theoretical tracts, they revived the doctrine of the tyrannicide. It had been opposed during the Middle Ages by the \"legists\" (jurists who theorized the royal power) who attempted to reserve the title of tyrant to those who tried to overturn the ruling monarch. Legists thus ended up legitimizing, under the name of \"tyrannicide\", the assassinations of political opponents ordered by the monarch.\n\nMonarchomachs considered that the end of the state was prosperity of the whole social group, as the true sovereign, granting effective practice of power to the king, whose authority remained of divine right. Exercise of popular sovereignty was to be delegated to the magistrates and the officers of the crown. They considered that the people were a collective body, possessed of a specific wisdom, which allowed them to understand better than the king the common good, distinct from the interest of each of its parties. Assimilated to the medieval \"universitas\", the people was thus considered as a legal subject, whose interests were represented by the General Estates. This conception of the magistrates and the association of wise people as best representants of the people separated them from modern conception of democracy, as they restricted effective power to a minority. Max Weber considered them in his lecture \"Politics as a Vocation\" as participants of the movement of rationalization of law in Europe. \n\nThe Monarchomachs also claimed that if the sovereign persecuted true religion, he would violate the contract concluded between God and the people, who were thus granted a right of rebellion. They were inspired by Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas, and the School of Salamanca on the killing of \"bad kings\". This legimitization of tyrannicide may have inspired as much the friar Clément, who assassinated Henry III in 1589, as Ravaillac, who assassinated Henry IV in 1610. Rebellion against tyranny was considered not only as necessary, but as a divine right.\n\nThe term \"Monarchomachs\" was coined by William Barclay in his book \"De Regno et Regali Potestate\" (About the Powers of Authority and Royalty), published in 1600. Barclay's theory was that the Huguenots had lost their struggle with the Catholic Church and were turning their battle towards the government to undermine the king's support of the Catholics. Eventually, the term was used to classify anyone who was opposed to the king's rule. \n\nAt first a Protestant doctrine, the notion of tyrannicide was reappropriated by the Catholics when Protestants came to be kings. It was then used in revolutionary discourses during the debates concerning the execution of Louis XVI, while the right of rebellion was included in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. \n\nInfluenced by the Huguenots, some British thinkers also embraced the Monarchomaque movement.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2168754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2168754", "title": "Mughal painting", "text": "Mughal painting\n\nMughal painting is that particular style of South Asian painting which generally confines miniatures either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums, which emerged from Persian miniature painting (itself largely of Chinese origin), with Indian Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist influences, and developed largely in the court of the Mughal Empire of the 16th to 18th centuries. \n\nMughal paintings later spread to other Indian courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and later Sikh. The mingling of foreign Persian and indigenous Indian elements was a continuation of the patronisation of other aspects of foreign culture as initiated by the earlier Turko-Afghan Delhi Sultanate, and the introduction of it into the subcontinent by various Central Asian Turkic dynasties, such as the Ghaznavids.\n\nThis art of painting developed as a blending of Persian and Indian ideas. There was already a Muslim tradition of miniature painting under the Turko-Afghan Sultanate of Delhi which the Mughals overthrew, and like the Mughals, and the very earliest of Central Asian invaders into the subcontinent, patronized foreign culture. Although the first surviving manuscripts are from Mandu in the years either side of 1500, there were very likely earlier ones which are either lost, or perhaps now attributed to southern Persia, as later manuscripts can be hard to distinguish from these by style alone, and some remain the subject of debate among specialists. By the time of the Mughal invasion, the tradition had abandoned the high viewpoint typical of the Persian style, and adopted a more realistic style for animals and plants.\n\nNo miniatures survive from the reign of the founder of the dynasty, Babur, nor does he mention commissioning any in his diaries, the \"Baburnama\". Copies of this were illustrated by his descendents, Akbar in particular, with many portraits of the many new animals Babur encountered when he invaded India, which are carefully described. However some surviving un-illustrated manuscripts may have been commissioned by him, and he comments on the style of some famous past Persian masters. Some older illustrated manuscripts have his seal on them; the Mughals came from a long line stretching back to Timur and were fully assimilated into Persianate culture, and expected to patronize literature and the arts.\n\nMughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures. Animals and plants were also more realistically shown. Although many classic works of Persian literature continued to be illustrated, as well as Indian works, the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries, begun by Babur, provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts, such as the Padshahnama genre of official histories. Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits, events and scenes from court life, wild life and hunting scenes, and illustrations of battles. The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image was continued.\n\nThe style of the Mughal school developed within the royal atelier. Knowledge was primarily transmitted through familial and apprenticeship relationships, and the system of joint manuscript production which brought multiple artists together for single works.\n\nWhen the second Mughal emperor, Humayun was in exile in Tabriz in the Safavid court of Shah Tahmasp I of Persia, he was exposed to Persian miniature painting, and commissioned at least one work there, an unusually large painting of \"Princes of the House of Timur\", now in the British Museum. When Humayun returned to India, he brought two accomplished Persian artists Abd al-Samad and Mir Sayyid Ali with him. His usurping brother Kamran Mirza had maintained a workshop in Kabul, which Humayan perhaps took over into his own. Humayan's major known commission was a \"Khamsa of Nizami\" with 36 illuminated pages, in which the different styles of the various artists are mostly still apparent. Apart from the London painting, he also commissioned at least two miniatures showing himself with family members, a type of subject that was rare in Persia but was to be common among the Mughals.\n\nMughal painting developed and flourished during the reigns of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan.\n\nDuring the reign of Humayun's son Akbar (r. 1556-1605), the imperial court, apart from being the centre of administrative authority to manage and rule the vast Mughal empire, also emerged as a centre of cultural excellence. Akbar inherited and expanded his father's library and atelier of court painters, and paid close personal attention to its output. He had studied painting in his youth under Abd as-Samad, though it is not clear how far these studies went.\n\nBetween 1560 and 1566 the \"Tutinama\" (\"Tales of a Parrot\"), now in the Cleveland Museum of Art was illustrated, showing \"the stylistic components of the imperial Mughal style at a formative stage\". \nAmong other manuscripts, between 1562 and 1577 the atelier worked on an illustrated manuscript of the \"Hamzanama\" consisting of 1,400 canvas folios. Sa'di's masterpiece The \"Gulistan\" was produced at Fatehpur Sikri in 1582, a \"Darab Nama\" around 1585; the Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208) followed in the 1590s and Jami's \"Baharistan\" around 1595 in Lahore. As Mughal-derived painting spread to Hindu courts the texts illustrated included the Hindu epics including the Ramayana and the Mahabharata; themes with animal fables; individual portraits; and paintings on scores of different themes. Mughal style during this period continued to refine itself with elements of realism and naturalism coming to the fore. Between the years of 1570 to 1585 Akbar hired over a one hundred painters to practice Mughal style painting.\n\nJahangir had an artistic inclination and during his reign Mughal painting developed further. Brushwork became finer and the colors lighter. Jahangir was also deeply influenced by European painting. During his reign he came into direct contact with the English Crown and was sent gifts of oil paintings, which included portraits of the King and Queen. He encouraged his royal atelier to take up the single point perspective favoured by European artists, unlike the flattened multi-layered style used in traditional miniatures. He particularly encouraged paintings depicting events of his own life, individual portraits, and studies of birds, flowers and animals. The \"Jahangirnama\", written during his lifetime, which is an autobiographical account of Jahangir's reign, has several paintings, including some unusual subjects such as the union of a saint with a tigress, and fights between spiders.\n\nDuring the reign of Shah Jahan (1628–58), Mughal paintings continued to develop, but court paintings became more rigid and formal. The illustrations from the \"Padshanama\" (chronicle of the King of the world), one of the finest Islamic manuscripts from the Royal Collection, at Windsor, were painted during the reign of Shah Jahan. Written in Persian on paper that is flecked with gold, has exquisitely rendered paintings. The \"Padshahnama\" has portraits of the courtiers and servants of the King painted with great detail and individuality. In keeping with the strict formality at court, however the portraits of the King and important nobles was rendered in strict profile, whereas servants and common people, depicted with individual features have been portrayed in the three -quarter view or the frontal view. \nThemes including musical parties; lovers, sometimes in intimate positions, on terraces and gardens; and ascetics gathered around a fire, abound in the Mughal paintings of this period.\n\nAurangzeb (1658-1707) did not actively encourage Mughal paintings, but as this art form had gathered momentum and had a number of patrons, Mughal paintings continued to survive, but the decline had set in. Some sources however note that a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for Aurangzeb, speculating that they believed that he was about to close the workshops and thus exceeded themselves in his behalf. There was a brief revival during the reign of Muhammad Shah 'Rangeela' (1719–48), but by the time of Shah Alam II (1759–1806), the art of Mughal painting had lost its glory. By that time, other schools of Indian painting had developed, including, in the royal courts of the Rajput kingdoms of Rajputana, Rajput painting and in the cities ruled by the British East India Company, the Company style under Western influence. Late Mughal style often shows increased use of perspective and recession under Western influence.\n\nThe Persian master artists Abd al-Samad and Mir Sayyid Ali, who had accompanied Humayun to India in the 16th century, were in charge of the imperial atelier during the formative stages of Mughal painting. Many artists worked on large commissions, the majority of them apparently Hindu, to judge by the names recorded. Mughal painting flourished during the late 16th and early 17th centuries with spectacular works of art by master artists such as Basawan, Lal, Daswanth, and Miskin. Another influence on the evolution of style during Akbar's reign was Kesu Das, who understood and developed \"European techniques of rendering space and volume\".\n\nGovardhan was a noted painter during the reigns of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan.\n\nThe sub-imperial school of Mughal painting included artists such as Mushfiq, Kamal, and Fazl.\n\nDuring the first half of the 18th century, many Mughal-trained artists left the imperial workshop to work at Rajput courts. These include artists such as Bhawanidas and his son Dalchand.\n\nMughal painting generally involved a group of artists, one to decide the composition, the second to actually paint, and the third to focus on portraiture, executing individual faces.\n\nMughal-style miniature paintings are still being created today by a small number of artists in Lahore concentrated mainly in the National College of Arts. Although many of these miniatures are skillful copies of the originals, some artists have produced contemporary works using classic methods with, at times, remarkable artistic effect.\n\nThe skills needed to produce these modern versions of Mughal miniatures are still passed on from generation to generation, although many artisans also employ dozens of workers, often painting under trying working conditions, to produce works sold under the signature of their modern masters.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Children learn the Onondaga language at Onondaga Nation School, and classes are also available for adults. In September 2015, it was announced that fifteen adults would enter a full-time language immersion class in Onondaga, after which they would become teachers of the language.\n\nThis table shows the (consonant) phonemes that are found in Onondaga.\nThe two plosives, , are allophonically voiced to and before vowels and resonants (the bottom row of the chart labelled 'sonorant') and are spelled and in this case. There is considerable palatalization and affrication in the language.\n\nOnondaga has five oral vowels, ( is sometimes represented orthographically as ), and two nasal vowels, and . The nasal vowels, following the Iroquoianist tradition, are spelled with ogoneks in the scholarly literature and in Ontario ( and or ). In New York, they are represented with a following ( and ). Vowels can be both short and long. When vowel length derives from the now lost consonant *r, it is phonemic. Vowel length is written with a following colon, or raised dot .\n\nOnondaga is a polysynthetic language, exhibiting a great deal of inflectional and derivational morphology on the verbal forms (including noun incorporation). Nominal forms have less morphology. Additionally, there are particles, which are monomorphemic.\n\nOnondaga verbs can be divided into three main classes according to their aspectual properties (discussed below). These are the active verbs, motion verbs, and stative verbs. We must distinguish between tense and aspect. Tense refers to when the event takes place, either in the past, the present or the future. Aspect refers to the event itself, such as whether it is finished or ongoing or occurs repeatedly. \n\nThere are four aspects in Onondaga. The first is the habitual aspect (HAB). This aspect is used to refer to an event that takes place repeatedly or on an ongoing basis. The second is the punctual aspect (PUNC) (also known as perfective aspect). This aspect refers to an entire event in its completeness. When used in the past tense, the event is described as “over and done-with.” It cannot describe an event that is interrupted or incomplete. The third aspect is the stative (STAT) (also known as imperfective) refers to an event that is ongoing or incomplete or, if it occurs in the past tense, that has some bearing on the present. Finally, there is the purposive aspect (PURP), which refers to imminent action and usually implies intent or volition on the part of the subject. Active verbs can appear with any of the first three aspects. Motion verbs can appear with any of all four aspects. Stative verbs can only appear with the stative aspect.\n\nA typical Onondaga verb consists of several morphemes (components). The following chart outlines the order of the morphemes. Obligatory morphemes appear in boldface, and optional morphemes are in standard font. Note that some of the “optional” morphemes are obligatory with certain verb roots. The obligatory morphemes, however, must appear on each and every single verb.\n\nEach of the following sections outlines the shapes that these morphemes can take.\n\nThe prepronominal prefixes express a variety of concepts and ideas. The first concept is modality, which expresses the degree of urgency, certainty or likelihood of the event. There are three modal prefixes in Onondaga. The modal prefixes only appear with the punctual aspect. They also appear if there is a modalizer suffix. The first of these is commonly called the future modal prefix (FUT). This prefix expresses events that have not yet taken place at the time the speaker is talking. The second is the factual modal prefix (FACT). This prefix indicates that the speaker knows the event happened for a fact. It typically has a past tense reading (since we are normally only sure about events that happened in the past). The third is optative modal prefix (OPT). This prefix expresses the idea that the event should or ought to take place. It is also used to express untrue events or events that might have taken place but have not. Here are some examples.\n\nThe following chart lists forms of the three modal prepronominal prefixes and indicates when to use which form.\n\n In addition to the modal prefixes, there is also a set of prefixes that express a variety of concepts, some of which do not have a clearly distinct meaning, rather their meaning varies depending on context. The list of these includes repetitive, cislocative, dualic, translocative, partitive, coincident, contrastive, and negative.\n\n The repetitive morpheme adds the meaning of doing something again or repeating some-thing. The basic form of the repetitive morpheme is /s-/. Here are some examples. Example (37) has the prepronominal prefix /sa-/, which is a combination of both repetitive and factual mood. Example (38) has the prepronominal prefix /ęs-/, which is a combination of repetitive and future. These contrast with example (39), which does not have the repetitive morpheme.\n\nThe cislocative (CLOC) morpheme is used to indicate movement toward the speaker. It can also mean that a particular event is pinpointed back in time. In some cases, the meaning of the cislocative is unpredictable. Some of these are listed below. There are two forms of the cislocative. \n\n/t-/ default<br>\n/di-/ used with any 2nd person or 1st person inclusive, except 2.SG.AG\n\nThe translocative (TLOC) morpheme is used to indicate movement away from the speaker. The form of the translocative is /he-/\n\nThe dualic (DUC) does not have a specific meaning. The form of the dualic is /de-/, but changes when it appears in combination with other prepronominal prefixes. Whenever it appears with a verb stem, it changes the meaning in unpredictable ways. Usually, however, there is some notion of there being two of something or of some reciprocal activity such as trading. Also, some verb roots must appear with the dualic prepronominal prefix. In examples (41) and (42), the dualic prefix is obligatory. In example (43), the dualic prefix adds the meaning of becoming two pieces.\n\nThere are three series of pronominal prefixes in Onondaga. There is a transitive series, used with transitive verbs. Intransitive verbs use either the agent series or the patient series. The choice between the latter two is often complex, as we will see. The phonological shape of the pronominal prefix depends on the identity of the following sound. This gives rise to several series of pronominal prefixes, which are labelled according to the following segment. These include the c-series (for pronominal prefixes which precede a consonant), the a-series (for pronominal prefixes which precede /a/), the e-series, ę-series, o-series, ǫ-series, and i-series. Finally, the pronominal prefixes inflect for person, number and gender. We discuss each of these in turn.\n\nOnondaga distinguishes three persons: first (I or we), second (you) and third (he, she, it or they). The first person can be either exclusive (EXCL), which excludes the listener, or inclusive (INCL), which includes the listener.\n\nHere, when John says we, it does not include the person he’s talking to. In other words, Mary doesn’t get to go to the movies. This use of we is called the first person exclusive. English does not make a distinction between inclusive and exclusive we but Onondaga does. Consider the following two words. The pronominal prefix /dn-/ indicates a first person dual inclusive subject, and the pronominal prefix /agn-/ indicates a first person dual exclusive subject.\n\nThree numbers are also distinguished in Onondaga: singular (for one entity, SG), dual (for two entities, DU), and plural (for three or more entities, PL). In the glosses, ‘singular’ is marked with SG, ‘dual’ is marked with DU, and ‘plural’ is marked with PL.\n\nAdditionally, Onondaga distinguishes three genders, which are realized in the third person only. The first is masculine (M), which is used to refer to male humans and certain animals, either alone or in a group. The second is feminine (F). This is used to refer to female humans, certain animals, or some unknown person. It is sometimes called the feminine-indefinite. For groups of people that contain both men and women, the masculine is used. The third is neuter (N), which is used to refer to most animals and inanimate objects. In older texts, the neuter is used to refer to human females in certain circumstances, although this usage is no longer common. See Abrams (2006: 17) for more discussion. (Abbott, 1984 also discusses two feminine genders in Oneida.) Here are some examples.\n\nFinally, we observe that there are two series of prefixes for intransitive verbs, the agent series (AG) and the patient series (PAT). As a general rule, verbs which involve active, purposeful movement or activity on the part of the subject are conjugated with the agent series. Verbs which involve involuntary action or states are conjugated with the patient series. There are so many exceptions to this generalization, however, that one has to simply learn for each intransitive verb whether it takes the agent or the patient series. There is an additional rule for the intransitive verbs that take the agent series. When these verbs appear with stative aspect, they use the patient series rather than the agent series. This rule does not have any exceptions.\n\nThere are six classes of conjugations which depend on the initial sound of the following morpheme (i.e., the first sound of the verb root or of the incorporated noun if there is one).\n\nThe following chart lists the pronominal prefixes for stems that begin with a consonant. Note that (y) or (w) in brackets disappears when preceded by a pre-pronominal prefix.\n\nIntransitive, Agent-series\n\nIntransitive, Patient-series\n\nTransitive Series\n\nThe following chart lists the pronominal prefixes for stems that begin with a consonant.

The reflexive is typically found only on transitive verbs, but because there is only one participant in the event, we use the intransitive series of pronominal prefixes. Here’s an example of a reflexive and a regular (non-reflexive) transitive for comparison.\n\nIn the non-reflexive transitive form there is a pronominal prefix, /sk-/ that indicates the subject (‘you’) and the object (‘me’). In the reflexive form, there is only one participant in the act of kicking (‘me’), so the intransitive form of the pronominal prefix is used, /k-/.\n\nA reflexive action is something that you do to yourself. A reciprocal action is something people do to each other. Reciprocals must have at least two people involved. They are formed with the reflexive marker and the dualic prepronominal prefix discussed in section 3.4.1.1.2.4. Here is an example.\n\nThe semireflexive (SRFL) appears in a variety of circumstances that are not easy to pin down. The usual form of the semireflexive is /at-/, but certain verb roots take different forms. Listed here are some of the more common situations in which the semireflexive is used. \n\nFinally, the semireflexive is used to describe events or actions that are internally caused or spontaneous.\n\nThe constituent morphemes are separated by hyphens in the second line of the example. Each one is translated, as closely as possible, in the third line. It is important to understand that none of the component morphemes is a separate word, since they cannot be uttered, or understood, in isolation.\n\nA second way in which linguists classify the morphology of languages is in terms of how the morphemes of a word combine. This distinction is between languages that are fusional and languages that are agglutinative. Fusion occurs in two ways: a single morpheme may have two or more functions (or meanings) in a given word or contiguous morphemes may affect each other's shape in such a way that it is difficult to segment the word into morphemes. A language is agglutinative if the morphemes composing a word each carries its own meaning and can be easily segmented from its neighbor. Onondaga is fusional (in the second sense of that term). Fusion is especially prevalent at the boundary between prefixes and the stem. Here certain phonological processes take place which change the shapes of one or both contiguous morphemes. For example:\n\nLanguages are also classified in terms of the preeminent morphological processes they manifest. In Onondaga the two major morphological processes are prefixing and suffixing. Prefixes and suffixes are bound morphemes, that is, they are morphemes that cannot occur in isolation. Onondaga verbs must, minimally, begin in a pronominal prefix and inflect for aspect. For example: \n\nNouns must, minimally, begin in a nominal prefix and end in a noun suffix. For example:\n\nA basic noun is composed of the following three morphemes in this order: noun prefix, root, and noun suffix.\n\nAccording to Woodbury (2003), nouns in Onondaga are categorized into two main classes. These are non-human and human. The inanimate nouns are further divided into natural and man-made. The prefix (NPRE) on the noun depends on these classes. For inanimate nouns, the prefix is either /o-/ for natural objects or /ka-/ for man-made objects. The noun forming suffix also depends on the noun class. It is / aˀ/ for non-human nouns and /-h/ for human nouns.\n\nNoun incorporation is a process of compounding in which two stems, a noun and a verb stem, are combined into a new stem that is inflected with verbal morphology and that functions as a verb. Nouns occupying the semantic roles or thematic relations, of patient, theme, factitive theme, location, goal, path, or instrument are eligible for incorporation. Of these, it is nouns designating semantic patients and themes that are most frequently incorporated. Semantic agents, causers, and beneficiaries are not eligible for incorporation. \n\nThe first example shows that the nominal root -nęh- \"corn\" has been incorporated into the verbal complex forming a single word. The second example shows the noun /onęhaʔ/ ('corn') as a separate word and preceded by the particle neʔ, a particle which marks a following word or phrase as a nominal.\n\nNoun incorporation is a highly productive process in Onondaga. However, its productivity is an attribute of individual nouns and verbs. Every noun and every verb is lexically marked in terms of its incorporation characteristics. Some nouns incorporate frequently, that is, they can combine with many different verbs, others almost never. Among the verbs that can incorporate—and some do not incorporate at all—there is a continuum of productivity. At their most productive, verbs can incorporate one of any number of nouns, in fact, some verbs can only occur together with an incorporated noun. Verbs at their most unproductive can incorporate only a single noun. Between these extremes are additional types: verbs that can incorporate only a restricted set of nouns; verb and noun combinations that are highly idiomatic—these often denote conventionalized activities (e.g., English 'he information-gathered)—so that separating the noun, though interpretable, is perceived as inappropriate. \n\nThe use of noun incorporation is governed by various discourse factors. It is often used as a way of backgrounding information.\n\nWord order is typically free in Onondaga (though see question formation below). It depends on various discourse factors.\n\nWh-questions begin with the interrogative word: \n\nYes-no questions are formed by appending the question-particle to the questioned item:\n\n\n\n"}

The industry directly employs more than 1.3 million and indirectly generates 1 million jobs in the US, creating a total job impact of 2.3 million.\n\nIn recent years, the use of this term has gained acceptance with and been popularized by amusement industry players, industry associations, trade magazines and even securities analysts. This stems from the desire to distinguish between the social, competitive atmosphere and dedicated hardware found in location-based entertainment venues from at-home consumer-game entertainment, mobile entertainment or even augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). The reality is that the lines are increasingly blurred with today's sophisticated consumers and emerging technologies.\n\nThis term is not to be confused with out-of-home media advertising as used by the advertising industry, although the convergence of digital out-of-home advertising and the digital out-of-home entertainment is producing innovations in retail and hospitality, steeped in fundamentals of social gaming experiences defined by the video amusement industry during the 70’s.\n\nDigital out-of-home entertainment (also DOE) is a sector that is understood by few but is a fast-growing technology sector with plenty of innovations transforming the sector. Its roots lie in the popularity of coin-operated arcade video games such as racing, fighting, Japanese imports, or pinball that Generation X will vividly recall with fond memories of countless hours of their youth spent in dimly-lit video-game rooms (popularly known as 'arcades').\n\nWhen Generation Y came along, an audience well-versed in digital gaming favored game consoles over arcade machines. So while video amusement remains an integral part of the popular culture fabric today, its relevancy is diminished and even perceived as 'dead' partly due to the lack of coverage by consumer-game media even as the amusement industry transformed itself and research and development investments continue to pour into the sector, evolving and growing the out-of-home, pay-to-play experience.\n\nIn 2011, the non-profit Digital Out-of-Home Interactive Entertainment Network Association was established to help \"define these amorphous groups that comprise this vibrant industry and illustrate how they all interact\" with groups spanning from \"family entertainment centers (FEC), location-based entertainment sites, visitor attractions, theme parks as well as retail, shopping malls and the hospitality sector – and not forgetting museums, heritage sites, schools\".\n\nMoviegoing is one of the most popular and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment.\nOther classic and expanded forms of OOHE making up the DOE sector include:\n\nThe traditional FECs is a classic form of OOHE that is easily understood by the public. FECs are essentially a converged outgrowth of theme restaurants and the winning formula of combining food and entertainment as a business model has been around for more than 30 years. The first Dave & Buster's was opened in 1982 in Dallas, Texas after discovering this winning formula and is a highly-successful FEC chain today with their \"Eat, Drink, Play, Watch\" offerings. Chuck E. Cheese first opened a store in 1977 and became the public embodiment of the typical children's party room combined with a pizza restaurant and arcade. Other restaurants started to come round to seeing the importance of amusement games and \"anchor\" attractions (bowling alleys, miniature golf, laser tags, batting cages, roller skating rinks, etc.) to encourage dwell time of 1–2 hours and stimulating repeat visits.\n\nProbably known more by the blockbuster arcade video game titles they produced rather than by company names, these video game developers played a defining role in the birth of the video amusement industry. In 1972, Atari essentially created the first commercially successful video game \"Pong,\" marking the beginning of the coin-operated video game industry. In 1978, the first blockbuster arcade video game, \"Space Invaders\" was produced by Taito Corporation and ushered in the golden age of arcade video games. Namco (of \"Pac-Man\"'s fame), Nintendo (\"Donkey Kong\"), Konami (), Capcom (\"Street Fighters\"), Sega AM2 (\"Daytona\") are among some of the most notable video game developers that remain active today in the video amusement scene.\n\nVideo game publishers are also making inroads into the OOHE market by licensing iconic IPs (intellectual property) to experienced arcade game developers and manufacturers, such as the recent collaboration between Ubisoft and LAI Games to produce \"Virtual Rabbids: The Big Ride\", an attendant-free VR attraction based on the popular \"Rabbids\" franchise.\n\nA redemption game is an arcade amusement game involving skill that rewards the player (in gifts, tokens, etc.) proportionately to his or her score. (Merchandizers also fall in the redemption game category.) One of the most popular redemption games, \"Skee Ball\", has more than 100,000 Skee-Ball branded alley games in use worldwide by some estimates and continue to endure after more than a century. In 2016, BayTek Games (known for their hit game \"Big Bass Wheel\") bought the rights to \"Skee-Ball\" from Skee-Ball Amusement Games, Inc. Innovative Concepts in Entertainment (ICE), another reputable manufacturer, produced hit midway-style redemption games such as \"Down The Clown\" and \"Gold Fishin\". LAI Games (formerly part of the Leisure and Allied Industries Group which founded Timezone) produced hit games such as \"Stacker\" and \"Speed of Light,\" the latter in which was embedded in popular culture with its appearance in Nickelodeon TV show Game Shakers.\n\nOther notable players include Apple Industries, Inc., Coastal Amusements, Universal Space (UNIS), Adrenaline Amusements.\n\nAnother category of video amusement games are simulators. Raw Thrills, best known for developing arcade video games based on films such as \"Jurassic Park Arcade\" and \"AMC's The\" \"Walking Dead\" \"Arcade\", is a common name found in medium and larger-sized FECs. Other established companies in this category are Triotech, maker of \"Typhoon\" - a 3D arcade machine with 2 seats and delivers up to 2G Forces of acceleration, and CJ 4DPLEX with their \"Mini Rider 3D\" - a 2-seat simulator on an electric motion base with a choice of several 3D movies.\n"}

Compass surveying is a type of surveying in which the directions of surveying lines are determined with a magnetic compass, and the length of the surveying lines are measured with a tape or chain or laser range finder. The compass is generally used to run a traverse line. The compass calculates bearings of lines with respect to magnetic north. The included angles can then be calculated using suitable formulas in case of clockwise and anti-clockwise traverse respectively. For each survey line in the traverse, surveyors take two bearings that is fore bearing and back bearing which should exactly differ by 180 if local attraction is negligible. The name \"Prismatic compass\" is given to it because it essentially consists of a prism which is used for taking observations more accurately.\n\nLeast count means the minimum value that an instrument can read which is 15 minutes in case of prismatic compass.

It was a burial place of Apis bulls, sacred bulls that were incarnations of the ancient Egyptian deity Ptah. It was believed that the bulls became immortal after death as \"Osiris Apis\", a name that appears in Coptic as , \"Userhapi\", which was borrowed in Greek as , \"Serapis\", in the Hellenistic period.\n\nThe most ancient burials found at this site date back to the reign of Amenhotep III, the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty during the 1350s BC.\n\nWorking as an administrator during the reign of his father, Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II (1279–1213 BC) of the nineteenth dynasty, ordered that a tunnel, now known as \"The Lesser Vaults\", be excavated through one of the mountains at the site and designed with side chambers to contain large granite sarcophagi weighing up to 70 tonnes each, to hold the mummified remains of the bulls. \n\nA second tunnel, approximately 350 m in length, 5 m tall and 3 m wide (), now known as \"The Greater Vaults\", was excavated under Psamtik I (664–610 BC) of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty and later used by the Ptolemaic dynasty.\n\nThe long boulevard leading to the ceremonial site, flanked by 600 sphinxes, likely was built under Nectanebo I, (379/8–361/0 BC) the founder of the thirtieth dynasty (the last native one).\n\nThe temple was discovered by Auguste Mariette, who had gone to Egypt to collect Coptic-language manuscripts, but later grew interested in the remains of the Saqqara necropolis. In 1850, Mariette found the head of one sphinx sticking out of the shifting desert dunes, cleared the sand and followed the boulevard to the site. After using explosives to clear rocks blocking the entrance to the catacomb, he excavated most of the complex. Unfortunately, his notes of the excavation were lost, which has complicated the use of these burials in establishing an Egyptian chronology. \n\nMariette found one undisturbed burial, which is now at the Agricultural Museum in Cairo. The other 24 sarcophagi of the bulls, had been robbed.\n\nA controversial aspect of the Saqqara find is that for the period between the reign of Ramesses XI and the twenty-third year of the reign of Osorkon II – about 250 years – only nine burials have been discovered, including three sarcophagi Mariette reported to have identified in a chamber too dangerous to excavate (that have not been located since). Because the average lifespan of a bull was between 25 and 28 years, egyptologists believe that more burials should have been found. Furthermore, four of the burials attributed by Mariette to the reign of Ramesses XI have since been retrodated. Scholars who favour changes to the standard Egyptian chronology, such as David Rohl, have argued that the dating of the Twentieth Dynasty should be pushed some 300 years later on the basis of the Saqqara discovery. \n\nMost scholars rebut that it is far more likely that some burials of sacred bulls are waiting to be discovered and excavated.\n\n"}

Located near an eponymous village, it is east of Raipur, the capital of the state. The site is spread near the banks of the river Mahanadi.\n\nThe town of Sirpur (aka Shirpur) has been mentioned in epigraphic and textual records dated to the 5th to the 8th centuries CE. The city was once the capital of the Sharbhapuriya and Somavamshi kings of Dakshina Kosala state. It was an important Buddhist, Hindu and Jain settlement of the South Kosala kingdom between the 5th and the 12th century CE. It was visited by Hieun Tsang, the 7th century Chinese Buddhist pilgrim. Recent excavations have uncovered 12 Buddhist viharas, 1 Jain vihara, monolithic statues of Buddha and Mahavira, 22 Shiva temples and 5 Vishnu temples, Shakti and Tantric temples, underground granary market and a sixth century bath house.\n\nSirpur, also referred to as Shripur and Sripura (literally, \"city of auspiciousness, abundance, Lakshmi\") in ancient Indian texts and inscriptions, is a village on the Mahanadi River east of Raipur. In the second half of the 1st millennium CE, it was the capital city with major commercial and religious significance for the Dakshina Kosala kingdom. The earliest documented evidence states that it was first a capital of Sharabhapuriya dynasty, followed by Panduvamshi dynasty. The Sharabhapuriya dynasty itself is dated to the late 5th century CE, but inscriptions mention its first capital to be Sharabhapura, as yet an unknown site.\n\nThe abundant inscriptions of the mid-6th century CE in the region mention the Hindu Shaiva king Teevardeva and 8th-century king Shivagupta Balarjuna establishing temples and monasteries for Hindus, Buddhists and Jains in his kingdom. The Chinese pilgrim and traveller Huen T'sang mentions visiting Sirpur in 639 CE in his memoirs. He wrote that the king was a Kshatriya and benevolent to the Buddhists, the region was prosperous. According to his memoir, some 10,000 Mahayana Buddhist \"bhikshus\" (monks) lived here in some 100 monasteries, and there were over 100 temples.\n\nThe earliest dated Sirpur monument is the Lakshmana temple, dated to 595-605 CE. Along with it, numerous other temples along the Mahanadi River stretching over from Rajim to Kharod have been located and dated to between 600 and 710 CE.\n\nThe South Kosala kingdom, along with the capital Sirpur, was taken over by the Kalachuri dynasty in the 11th century, with eastern parts of the South Kosala taken over by the Somavamshi kingdom to their east. The 12th century and 13th century history of the region is unclear. Excavations in the region have yielded layers of deposits, traceable from the mid 1st millennium BCE, the Gupta Empire period, through the late medieval period with the youngest layer of deposits being ruins mixed with \"chilum\" (smoke pipe) and Sultanate era coins suggesting that Sirpur was an active human settlement at least through the early Delhi Sultanate.\n\nSirpur became a major archaeological site after it was visited in 1882 by Alexander Cunningham, a colonial British India official. His report on a Laxman (Lakshmana) temple at Sirpur brought it to international attention. The site remained neglected in early 20th-century during the decades of the World Wars, and excavations resumed in 1953. There were further excavations in 1990s and then particularly after 2003 when 184 mounds were identified and some selectively excavated. Those excavations have so far yielded 22 Shiva temples, 5 Vishnu temples, 10 Buddha Viharas, 3 Jain Viharas, a 6th/7th century market and snana-kund (bath house). The site shows extensive syncretism, where Buddhist and Jain statues or motifs intermingle with Shiva, Vishnu and Devi temples.\nThere are two theories on the demise of Sirpur city and what led to the capital's sudden ruin. One posits that an earthquake leveled the entire region and people abandoned the capital and the kingdom. Another posits a catastrophic destruction after invasion and plunder. Coins of Sultan Alaud din Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate have been found among the ruins, and the stairs of one of the monuments show signs of partial caving in, neither establishes nor rules out the proposals. The discovery of Khalji era coins mixed with the ruins during the excavation can be attributed to other reasons such as trade between Delhi Sultanate and Dakshina Kosala kingdom, and a spot caving in can be because of localized soil subsidence.\n\nSirpur is also a major archaeological site for \"bronze sculptures from the early medieval period\". According to Geri Hockfield Malandra, Sirpur was a significant bronze workshop of ancient India and the Buddhist bronze artwork excavated from Sirpur are among the \"finest bronze sculptures\" of that era. There are striking similarities between the artwork in Sirpur and the Ellora Caves as well as Ratnagiri, according to Malandra, and this may suggest a flow of ideas and artists between the two regions.\n\nThe Lakshmana temple, also spelled Laxman temple, is a 7th-century brick temple, mostly damaged and ruined. The garbhagriya entrance along with the tower and door carvings of the Lakshmana temple at Sirpur are reasonably intact enough to be studied. Above the sanctum door's lintel are carvings show a reclining Vishnu on Sesha (Anantasayana Vishnu) and a panel on Krishna from \"Bhagavata Purana\". Around the door are bands of carvings which show the ten avatars of Vishnu along with daily life and couples in various stages of courtship and mithuna. The temple stands on a stone \"jagati\" platform (about 40'x80') with wide enough space for circumambulation. The temple itself is built of brick except for the carved frame around the grabha-griya (sanctum) made of stone. The sanctum opens to the east. In front of the sanctum is the outline of an antarala (vestibule), and an oblong mandapa (ceremonial community hall). The hall shows stub places for pillars, all now lost to history. Except for the sanctum and the tower, much is in ruins. The sanctum stone frame outside is a 22x22 feet square, inside it is about 10x10 feet square. The sanctum walls are plain like typical Hindu temples. The original statue of sanctum is missing. The site management has installed several small statues for visitors from what was found in the ruins pile.\n\nRama temple is situated less than 100 meters southeast of the Lakshmana temple, but it is almost entirely in ruins. The Rama temple site, however, does preserve the foundation outline of several shrines as well as brick stub of the lower part of the original Rama temple. Immediately to the north of the Rama temple is an outline which local tradition states was also dedicated to Lakshmana as Rama-Lakshmana pair. The Rama temple follows a stellate (star-shape) jagati pattern, while its Lakshmana pair was without one. The mandapa and other features of the Rama were destroyed long ago, according to Donald Stadtner, and the Rama temple site is likely to be from about 600 CE. This is one of the earliest star shape \"jagati\" platform temple in central India. It may have served as a prototype practice temple, before Sirpur architects of the 7th century built much grander stellate-principle Hindu temples in Kharod, Palari and Rajim.\n\nGandheshwar Temple: an active Shiva temple, Gandheshwar temple is situated on the banks of the Mahanadi River. From the river, there are stone stairs to walk to the sanctum. The temple is routinely re-washed and re-painted. It likely includes recovered ruins from the area, in which the locals have included Hindu, Buddhist and Jain iconography. A stone slab that is part of the temple wall has a Sanskrit inscription in Nagari script, starting with Om symbol and dedicated to Shiva, which has been dated to the 8th-century.\n\nBaleshwar Mahadev temples group: A Shiva temple about 50 meter northwest of the Teevar dev monument, across the Sirpur road. It consists of several temples. For three Shiva temples excavated, a circumambulatory Jagati in the form of a high rise platform, similar to Lakshmana temple survives. For another only the foundation is visible. The cluster was built by the Shaiva king Shivagupta Balarjuna, and is dated to the mid 8th century. Two of the temple are located side by side, and unlike most Sirpur temples, these open to the west. Both have a mandapa, an antarala and have a star shaped garbha griya made out of bricks and stone. The stellate sanctum is formed out of two squares, one rotated by 45 degrees. Some of the artwork discovered during excavations are displayed, and these show women and couple standing dressed up in 8th-century attire. The sanctum has Shiva linga made from marble.\n\nSurang tila: It is the largest temple complex in Sirpur, with a pillared terrace raised 30 feet above the group, stone steps connecting the terrace to the ruined mandapa platform remains below. The stairs have partially caved it in a spot from ground subsidence. The pillared terrace on the top was likely a mandapa, as it has ruins of many carved pillars in navaranga pattern. The terrace connects with five sanctums, which have two gray Shiva linga, one features a black granite Shiva linga and other two are dedicated to Vishnu. The temple is made out of white stone. It used to be a soil mound with tunnels (\"surang\") used by the locals, but the temple was excavated between 2006 and 2007. An inscription was found during the excavation which is now in the Raipur museum. According to this inscription, this temple was operating during the time of Shivagupta Balarjuna, and the temple is dated to 7th or 8th century. Below the temple terrace, are ruins of two buildings, one likely a residence for priests and monks, another a small tantric temple with 16-edge Shiva linga possibly from later centuries.\n\nRakela Tal, fort ruins and other temples: located south near the Rama temple on the east side of the Sirpur road is a man made lake full of lotus flowers. Around the lake are ruins of an old fort, several Hindu and Buddhist monuments mixed in with farmlands and a modern era Krishna temple. Sirpur has over 20 other excavated medieval temples and 50 additional unexcavated mounds spread over a three square kilometres area.\n\nAnanda Prabhu Kuti vihara: a temple and 14-room monastery, built by Bhikshu Anand Prabhu, called Ananda Prabha in some inscriptions, with sponsorship from the Hindu king Sivagupta Balarjuna. The monastery and temple ruins included a monument to Avalokiteśvara and Makarwahini Gange. A stone inscription found at the site, in Sanskrit written in Nagari script and dated to mid 8th century CE uses a mix of Vedic meters (Anustubh, Sragdhara, Arya, Vasantatilaka and others). The inscription states starts with auspicious symbol Om and Siddham, praises Sugata (Buddha) then lauds king Balarjuna. It thereafter mentions monk Anandaprabha, devoted to the Buddha the Maravarin (enemy of Mara) and the destroyer of the cycle of rebirth and death. The inscription says the king established a \"vihara kuti\" (monastery residences) and a free feeding house for all the monks there furnished with \"setike\" and \"vyanjana\" (rice meal with condiments) for \"so long as the sun adorns the sky\" (perpetuity). The inscription poem thereafter reminds the monks to remember the spirit of the king's gift, the impermanence of wealth, that dharma is the only saving grace to suffering-filled worldly existence. The inscription is signed by the artist who created it for the monastery.\n\nSwastika vihara: excavated in the 1950s, the aerial view of this monument's layout reminds of the swastika sign. This site yielded a Buddha statue and metallic idols relating to the Buddhist era. Along with Buddha was the image of Padamapani carrying a fly whisk.\nTeevar dev: a monastery from the Dakshina Kosala era, this Vihara, also referred to as Tivradeva, is located near a Shiva temple and is about 1 km away from the Lakshmana temple. The temple is syncretic, built by a Shaiva king and his Buddhist queen, it shows Hindu and Buddhist themes. The monument is a syncretic collection of Buddhist and Hindu arts, as it shows along with Buddha statues and Buddhist artwork, Hindu themes such as Ganga and Yamuna goddesses, kama and mithuna scenes, \"Panchatantra\" tales as well as Gajalakshmi.\n\nOne Jain basati and monastery ruins has been discovered near the river banks and about 100 meters from an 8th-century Shiva temple. A bronze image of Adinatha (Rishbha, the first Tirthankara) was found in the ruins, and the image is dated to the 9th century.\n\nA museum managed by Archaeological Survey of India in the Lakshmana temple premises preserves the artwork parts and pieces of archaeological ruins found during excavations in the 1950s and in the 2000s. These belong to Shaiva, Vaishnav, Buddha and Jain religions and variously dated to between 6th and 12th centuries.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14241792", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14241792", "title": "TRACE (psycholinguistics)", "text": "TRACE (psycholinguistics)\n\nTRACE is a connectionist model of speech perception, proposed by James McClelland and Jeffrey Elman in 1986. It is based on a structure called \"the Trace,\" a dynamic processing structure made up of a network of units, which performs as the system's working memory as well as the perceptual processing mechanism. TRACE was made into a working computer program for running perceptual simulations. These simulations are predictions about how a human mind/brain processes speech sounds and words as they are heard in real time.\n\nTRACE was created during the formative period of connectionism, and was included as a chapter in \"Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructures of Cognition\". The researchers found that certain problems regarding speech perception could be conceptualized in terms of a connectionist interactive activation model. The problems were that (1) speech is extended in time, (2) the sounds of speech (phonemes) overlap with each other, (3) the articulation of a speech sound is affected by the sounds that come before and after it, and (4) there is natural variability in speech (e.g. foreign accent) as well as noise in the environment (e.g. busy restaurant). Each of these causes the speech signal to be complex and often ambiguous, making it difficult for the human mind/brain to decide what words it is really hearing. In very simple terms, an interactive activation model solves this problem by placing different kinds of processing units (phonemes, words) in isolated layers, allowing activated units to pass information between layers, and having units within layers compete with one another, until the “winner” is considered “recognized” by the model.\n\n\"TRACE was the first model that instantiated the activation of multiple word candidates that match any part of the speech input.\" A simulation of speech perception involves presenting the TRACE computer program with mock speech input, running the program, and generating a result. A successful simulation indicates that the result is found to be meaningfully similar to how people process speech.\n\nIt is generally accepted in psycholinguistics that (1) when the beginning of a word is heard, a set of words that share the same initial sound become activated in memory, (2) the words that are activated compete with each other while more and more of the word is heard, (3) at some point, due to both the auditory input and the lexical competition, one word is recognized.\n\nFor example, a listener hears the beginning of \"bald\", and the words bald, ball, bad, bill become active in memory. Then, soon after, only bald and ball remain in competition (bad, bill have been eliminated because the vowel sound doesn't match the input). Soon after, bald is recognized. TRACE simulates this process by representing the temporal dimension of speech, allowing words in the lexicon to vary in activation strength, and by having words compete during processing. Figure 1 shows a line graph of word activation in a simple TRACE simulation.\nIf an ambiguous speech sound is spoken that is exactly in between and , the hearer may have difficulty deciding what it is. But, if that same ambiguous sound is heard at the end of a word like woo/?/ (where ? is the ambiguous sound), then the hearer will more likely perceive the sound as a . This probably occurs because wood is a word but woot is not. An ambiguous phoneme presented in a lexical context will be perceived as consistent with the surrounding lexical context. This perceptual effect is known as the Ganong effect. TRACE reliably simulates this, and can explain it in relatively simple terms. Essentially, the lexical unit which has become activated by the input (i.e. wood) feeds back activation to the phoneme layer, boosting the activation of its constituent phonemes (i.e. ), thus resolving the ambiguity.\n\nSpeakers usually don't leave pauses in between words when speaking, yet listeners seem to have no difficulty hearing speech as a sequence of words. This is known as the segmentation problem, and is one of the oldest problems in the psychology of language. TRACE proposed the following solution, backed up by simulations. When words become activated and recognized, this reveals the location of word boundaries. Stronger word activation leads to greater confidence about word boundaries, which informs the hearer of where to expect the next word to begin.\n\nThe TRACE model is a connectionist network with an input layer and three processing layers: pseudo-spectra (feature), phoneme and word. Figure 2 shows a schematic diagram of TRACE. There are three types of connectivity: (1) feedforward excitatory connections from input to features, features to phonemes, and phonemes to words; (2) lateral (i.e., within layer) inhibitory connections at the feature, phoneme and word layers; and (3) top-down feedback excitatory connections from words to phonemes. \nThe input to TRACE works as follows. The user provides a phoneme sequence that is converted into a multi-dimensional feature vector. This is an approximation of acoustic spectra extended in time. \nThe input vector is revealed a little at a time to simulate the temporal nature of speech. As each new chunk of input is presented, this sends activity along the network connections, changing the activation values in the processing layers. Features activate phoneme units, and phonemes activate word units. Parameters govern the strength of the excitatory and inhibitory connections, as well as many other processing details. \nThere is no specific mechanism that determines when a word or a phoneme has been recognized. If simulations are being compared to reaction time data from a perceptual experiment (e.g. lexical decision), then typically an activation threshold is used. This allows for the model behavior to be interpreted as recognition, and a recognition time to be recorded as the number of processing cycles that have elapsed. For deeper understanding of TRACE processing dynamics, readers are referred to the original publication and to a TRACE software tool that runs simulations with a graphical user interface.\n\nTRACE’s relevance to the modularity debate has recently been brought to the fore by Norris, Cutler and McQueen’s (2001) report on the Merge (?) model of speech perception. While it shares a number of features with TRACE, a key difference is the following. While TRACE permits word units to feed back activation to the phoneme level, Merge restricts its processing to feed-forward connections. In the terms of this debate, TRACE is considered to violate the principle of information encapsulation, central to modularity, when it permits a later stage of processing (words) to send information to an earlier stage (phonemes). Merge advocates for modularity by arguing that the same class of perceptual phenomena that is accounted for in TRACE can be explained in a connectionist architecture that \"does not\" include feedback connections. Norris et al. point out that when two theories can explain the same phenomenon, parsimony dictates that the simpler theory is preferable.\n\nModels of language processing can be used to conceptualize the nature of impairment in persons with speech and language disorder. For example, it has been suggested that language deficits in expressive aphasia may be caused by excessive competition between lexical units, thus preventing any word from becoming sufficiently activated. Arguments for this hypothesis consider that mental dysfunction can be explained by slight perturbation of the network model's processing. This emerging line of research incorporates a wide range of theories and models, and TRACE represents just one piece of a growing puzzle.\n\nPsycholinguistic models of speech perception, e.g. TRACE, must be distinguished from computer speech recognition tools. The former are psychological theories about how the human mind/brain processes information. The latter are engineered solutions for converting an acoustic signal into text. Historically, the two fields have had little contact, but this is beginning to change.\n\nTRACE’s influence in the psychology literature can be assessed by the number of articles that cite it. There are 345 citations of McClelland and Elman (1986) in the PsycINFO database. Figure 3 shows the distribution of those citations over the years since publication. The figure suggests that interest in TRACE grew significantly in 2001, and has remained strong, with about 30 citations per year.\n\n"}

It is the second film featuring the eccentric inventor Wallace (voiced by Peter Sallis) and his dog Gromit, following \"A Grand Day Out\" (1989)\".\" In the film, a sinister penguin uses Wallace and Gromit's robotic \"Techno Trousers\" to steal a diamond.\n\n\"The Wrong Trousers\" premiered in the United States on 17 December 1993, and the United Kingdom on 26 December 1993. It was commercially successful and won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. It also inspired a charity fundraising day, known as \"Wrong Trousers Day\", one of several events. A sequel, \"A Close Shave\", was released in 1995.\n\nWallace gives Gromit a pair of futuristic ‘techno trousers’. Wallace decides to advertise the spare bedroom to let. The room is taken by a penguin, who befriends Wallace and isolates Gromit. The penguin takes an interest in the techno trousers after seeing Gromit use their suction feet to walk on the ceiling while decorating. After Gromit is driven from the house, the penguin secretly rewires the techno trousers for radio control.\n\nWhile Gromit hunts for lodgings, he discovers a wanted poster offering a reward for the capture of a criminal chicken by the name of Feathers McGraw.

{"id": "8597359", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8597359", "title": "Topoxte", "text": "Topoxte\n\nTopoxte () (or Topoxté in Spanish orthography) is a pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site in the Petén Basin in northern Guatemala with a long occupational history dating as far back as the Middle Preclassic. As the capital of the Kowoj Maya, it was the largest of the few Postclassic Mesoamerican sites in the area. Topoxte is located on an island on Yaxha Lake across from the important Classic period center of Yaxha.\n\nTopoxte was named by Teobert Maler in 1904; the name means \"seed of the Ramón tree.\" There is no record of the name Topoxte prior to this. The Ramón tree, commonly known as breadnut, was an important component of the ancient Maya diet. Prior to this the site was known as \"Islapag\", as noted in 1831 by Juan Galindo in his report to the Society of Antiquaries of London.\n\nTopoxte occupies five of a cluster of six islands at the western end of Lake Yaxha in the municipality of Melchor de Mencos in the eastern part of the Guatemalan department of Petén. Due to the extreme fluctuations of the water level of the lake, these islands can sometimes become landlocked.\n\nThe principal occupation existed on the three islands named Topoxte, Cante and Paxte. When the water level was higher the lake was connected via a natural canal to the neighbouring Lake Sacnab, which lies to the east. Three smaller lakes lie to the west, from west to east they are lakes Chompoxte, Colorada and Coloradita.\n\nThe island of Topoxte lies at an altitude of above sea level. The island is formed from limestone with the highest elevation in the northern part of the island, sloping gently down towards the south.\n\nThe closest town is Flores, the capital of the Petén department, to the west as the crow flies. Topoxte is west of the international border with Belize and about south of the international border with Mexico. It is northeast of Zacpeten, another important Kowoj settlement.\n\nArchaeological investigations have revealed that the site was occupied from the Middle Preclassic right through to the Late Postclassic. Obsidian from the Ixtepeque source started to be used from the Terminal Classic onwards and is used as a diagnostic marker for dating finds to the later periods of occupation at the site, when Ixtepeque became the principal source of obsidian for Topoxte and the wider Maya lowlands.\n\nThe site was abandoned at the end of the Classic period (ca. 900) and reoccupied during the Postclassic at approximately 1100. After being inhabited for a further three and a half centuries it may finally have been abandoned around 1450, although this has now been challenged.\n\nThe site was first occupied toward the end of the Middle Preclassic, as evidenced by a number of burials and artifacts dating to this period, and the possible Late Preclassic substructure underlying Building C on Topoxte Island. However, evidence for Middle Preclassic occupation is scarce and is largely confined to the Main Plaza on Topoxte Island.\n\nCeramic evidence indicates that there was a degree of contact with the Guatemalan highlands in the Late Preclassic.\n\nBurial 49, which dates to AD 750, indicates a marriage of the Lady Twelve Guacamaya from Topoxte with a prince from Tikal. In the Terminal Classic, immediately prior to the temporary abandonment of the site, the ceramic style of Topoxte was very similar to the ceramics of Tikal and Uaxactun. At this time, Topoxte was a part of the Yaxha polity.\n\nTopoxte was an important site in the Postclassic and had close ties with the city of Mayapan in the north of the Yucatán Peninsula. It was fortified and probably served as an important nexus in the trade routes between the Maya highlands and the Yucatán. It was a small capital with about six temples and a similar number of open halls. As well as strong ties with Mayapan, there are striking similarities with sites of the Tulum group, indicating that these sites belong to the same specific cultural tradition.\n\nSome plain stelae were raised in the Postclassic, which were perhaps covered in stucco and painted. This may represent a revival of the katun-ending ceremonies that occurred in the Classic Period, again reflecting ties with the northern Yucatán. Strong ties with Mayapan are also reflected by the ceramic style, particularly modelled effigy incense burners.\n\nThe three principal islands were densely inhabited during the Postclassic with a great deal of construction taking place. The site was abandoned about the same time as Mayapan, around 1450, when the Kowoj Maya, moved their capital west to Zacpetén Island in the Salpetén lake, near the Peten Itza lake.\n\nSpanish missionaries Fuensalida and Orbita are said to have passed by Lake Yaxha in 1618, at which time they reported that there appeared to be no inhabitants, indicating that the site had already been abandoned by this time. However, it has been suggested that their indigenous guides deliberately led them via a neighbouring lake in order to mislead them into thinking that the Yaxhá region was uninhabited. The mention of Lake Yaxha by these missionaries is the only mention of the lake in colonial period records.\n\nAlthough he probably never visited the site, the existence of Topoxte was first reported by Juan Galindo in 1831, in his report to the Society of Antiquaries. Teoberto Maler spent three days at the site in 1904, clearing the site core and describing Building C and recording 9 stela-altar pairs. Sylvanus Morley visited Topoxte in 1914, describing the sculptured stelae of the site, including 2 on Cante Island. In 1933 Cyrus L. Lundell and L. C. Stuart made a new plan of the main plaza and assigned the nomenclature to the structures that is still used today. William R. Bullard carried out excavations at Topoxte from 1958 to 1960 and identified the Postclassic occupation of the site. Further excavations were carried out in 1973 and 1974 by Don and Prudence Rice, on Cante Island.\n\nThe site was damaged by looters in the 1970s and 80s. PRONAT (\"Proyecto Nacional Tikal\") undertook clearing and restoration work at Topoxte in 1989, including the erection of scaffolding and a protective roof on Building C, the main temple. Archaeological investigations of the site were undertaken from 1991 to 1993.\n\nThe principal ruins of the pre-Columbian city are spread over three islands:Topoxte, Cante and Paxte, in the southwest of Yaxha Lake, of which Topoxte is the largest. All three of these islands were densely occupied, with all construction except the ceremonial architecture being aligned according to the local topography.\n\nPaxte Island is the smallest of the three principal islands with a surface area of approximately . It is about west of Topoxte Island. 68 structures have been identified on Paxte, mostly low rectangular platforms built from unworked limestone, presumably the remains of domestic buildings. There are two groups of larger buildings located on the highest part of the island, aligned north-south, a fact that distinguishes them from the smaller residential buildings, which are aligned according to the local topography. Excavations suggest that Paxte was occupied from the Late Postclassic into the Postclassic.\n\nCante Island has a surface area of approximately , with a steep slope on the east side and a gentler slope on the west side. Cante lies to the west of Paxte Island and contains the remains of 142 structures that have been mapped. The main group is organised around a plaza but the majority of the buildings were arranged according to the local topography. Almost all the structures of Cante are medium-sized rectangular platforms. Like Paxte, Cante appears to have been occupied from the Late Postclassic into the Postclassic. Sylvanus Morley found 2 sculpted stelae on the island in 1914, they have been dated to the Late Classic.\n\nTopoxte Island measures roughly from north to south and from east to west, it has a crescent shape with a bay on the west side. It is the largest of the three principal islands and contains the remains of around 100 structures, as well as the principal ceremonial centre of the city. The largest structures are largely concentrated in two groups in the centre and in the north of the island.\n\nTopoxte Island had a surge in construction activity in the Postclassic suggesting a population influx at this time, in parallel to an equivalent influx into the area of Lake Petén Itzá region in response to the collapse of Chichen Itza in the north of the Yucatán Peninsula. The ceremonial architecture at Topoxte includes two major periods of construction in the Late Postclassic and closely reflects that at Zacpeten, another Kowoj site, and also seems to be linked to activity at Mayapan.\n\nTen different construction phases are apparent in the archaeological record of Topoxte. The first three phases date to the Preclassic. There are three distinctive groups at the site, two 5 meter tall platforms, and a low residential area consisting of more than 100 structures. The site’s central plaza is bounded by 3 temples constructed in the Postclassic architectural style similar to structures at Mayapan (incorporating vertical walls, columns and flat stone ceilings).\n\nThe ruins on the island of Topoxte start about four meters above the current level of Lake Yaxha, indicating that the Postclassic water level was roughly the same as present, or perhaps slightly higher. The site was laid out in a manner very similar to the contemporary site of Tayasal on Lake Petén Itzá, now covered by the modern town of Flores, with buildings on the north, south and east side of the main plaza and the west side open to the lake and the sunset. The stone buildings of Topoxte were all built with limestone.\n\nThe Main Plaza is built upon an artificial platform constructed with more than of fill. It is roughly rectangular with a surface area of approximately , it is one of the highest plazas on the island. The plaza is open on the west side and bordered on the north by Building G, on the south by Building B and on the east by Buildings C, D and E. The majority of worked monuments at Topoxte are located in the southwest corner of this plaza. The Main Plaza was the focus of activity from very early in the history of the site, with an offering dating to the Middle Preclassic being found in front of Building E and further Middle Preclassic evidence being found in deep levels in front of Building D. However, the plaza did not reach its maximum size until the Postclassic.\n\nBuilding C is perhaps the best example of Postclassic architecture in the Petén region. It is located on the east side of the Main Plaza and is a stepped pyramid with three platforms, measuring , and high. The pyramid has a steep stairway ascending from the plaza on the west side of the building at an angle of 49°.\n\nA fourth level is built upon the three platforms, with its own access stairway climbing from the top platform. This fourth level supported the temple building, which originally had walls approximately high and thick. A broken stela fragment measuring by was found on the third tier, in front of the access stairway to the temple. It was associated with an offering of human bones (Burial 22).\n\nThe temple building was divided into two rooms covering an area of . The rooms were divided by a wall and two columns, and a step. The entrance to the temple is divided into three wide sections divided by two columns. The stone construction was originally covered with stucco or whitewash. The building was damaged in modern times by two looters' pits, one at the base and one near the top. During investigation of the upper pit, Burial 21 was discovered. A second burial (Burial 23) was found in the third tier of the pyramid during restoration work.\n\nBuilding C was built upon a previous structure dating to the end of the Late Preclassic or the beginning of the Early Classic. This earlier building was enlarged in the Postclassic.\n\nBuilding A is the only large building that can be assigned to the Late Classic. It was formed of a three-tier stepped platform supporting a small temple, perhaps sporting a roof comb. This building was badly damaged in the Postclassic when it was quarried for building stone for later buildings, completely stripping away the facade.\n\nBuilding B is a long, north-facing palace-type structure standing on the south side of the Main Plaza.\n\nBuilding D and Building E are built on the same platform on the east side of the Main Plaza, immediately to the north of Building C. Building D is a rectangular platform with rounded corners.\n\nStructure E occupied the same platform as Building D. The structure was part of a temple complex. It shows two construction phases with the earlier taking place around 1200.\n\nBuilding G is a small square structure on the north side of the Main Plaza. It faces southward onto the plaza.\n\nStructure J is a low platform in the middle of the plaza opposite the stairway of Structure C. It is poorly preserved.\n\nBuilding K is on the east side of the Main Plaza and once supported two Late Classic stelae.\n\nAs of 1995, 26 burials had been excavated at Topoxte. Two burials were interred in rough cists, two were interred in caves and one in a funerary urn. Eighteen burials were individual, four were multiple burials and four consisted of single burials with additional skulls interred with the deceased.\n\nBurial 1 dates to the Postclassic. It was excavated in a possible residential patio among a group of small buildings at the south end of Topoxte island. It was possibly interred in a seated position. The remains belong to an adult male aged between 15 and 25 years old and were found buried with fragments of tortoiseshell.\n\nBurial 2 was found in the south of Topoxte island. The remains belong to an adult male between 25 and 35 years old and were oriented north-south. Associated offerings included an earthenware bowl and a necklace consisting of four shell or bone beads. This burial dates to the Late Classic.\n\nBurial 3 was found in the south of Topoxte island. The remains are those of an adult male aged from 25 to 35 years old and are mixed with the bones of a second individual. Associated offerings include two obsidian prismatic blades. The burial dates to the Early Classic.\n\nBurial 4 was excavated from an artificial terrace near the northwest corner of Building A and dates to the Postclassic. The remains belonged to an adult female between 17 and 25 years old. She was buried with a broken copper disk and a piece of flint.\n\nBurial 5 was excavated from a residential area in the northwest of Topoxte island. The remains were those of a child between 2 and 4 years old, possibly buried in a seated position. A shell bead was found under the skull. The age of the remains is uncertain, but they may date to the Preclassic.\n\nBurial 6 was partially excavated from the extreme southeastern edge of the island, the remains are those of an adult and were apparently interred outside of the limits of the urban area of the site. The gender of the remains is uncertain but they have been tentatively identified as female and date to the Early Classic.\n\nBurial 7 was found in a residential area in the northern part of Topoxte island. Only about 10% of the remains were recovered, they belong to an adult tentatively identified as male. The remains were buried with the head aligned towards the south and were associated with two pieces of worked flint. They date to the Postclassic.\n\nBurial 8 dates to the Postclassic. It was excavated from the western edge of Building E, which is located by the Main Plaza. The remains are those of an adult male between 17 and 25 years old. A second skull was found interred with the burial, belonging to an adult female of similar age to the principal remains.\n\nBurial 9 dates to the Postclassic. The bones are those of an adult male between 17 and 25 years old. The remains were interred with a prismatic blade of grey obsidian, they were found in a columned building in the extreme north of Topoxte island.\n\nBurial 10 was found in the northern extreme of Topoxte island, the remains are those of an adult male and date to the Postclassic. Interred with the deceased were a worked flint and a piece of slate.\n\nBurial 11 was associated with an altar platform to the west of Building E, in the Main Plaza. The remains are those of an adult of indeterminate gender, between 15 and 25 years old. Two pieces of flint were buried with the remains, which date to the Postclassic.\n\nBurial 12 is located to the south of a low residential platform, upon an artificial terrace in the north of Topoxte island. The burial contains the remains of two or possibly three individuals. Various items were associated with the burial, such as a fragment of a flint knife and another of grey obsidian, and several pieces of bone needle. One of the skeletons belongs to an adult female between 17 and 25 years of age, the other is that of a child of between 5 and 8 years of age, they both date to the Preclassic.\n\nBurial 13 was found to the south of Building G, in the Main Plaza, and may have been interred at the time that the plaza was levelled. The remains are those of an adult, possibly female, between 25 and 40 years old. The burial is associated with several pieces of flint and obsidian and dates to the Early Classic.\n\nBurial 14 was interred near the northeastern shore of Topoxte island, near a residential complex. It consists of two individuals, an adult male between 17 and 25 years old and a seated adult female between 25 and 35 years old. The burial dates from the Postclassic Period.\n\nBurial 15 was found to the north of Building H, on an artificial elevation near the centre of Topoxte island, among mixed residential and non-residential buildings. The remains are those of an adult, tentatively identified as female and of unknown age. The burial dates to the Late Classic. Associated offerings included an inverted ceramic vessel, a flint projectile point, a grey obsidian prismatic blade, a shell disk, two perforated ceramic disks and various other pieces of worked flint. Some of these items may actually be rubbish dumped on top of the burial, with only the inverted vessel being a definite offering associated with the human remains. The burial dates to the Late Classic.\n\nBurial 16 was found under a patio in the central area of Topoxte island, to the east of some relatively tall structures. The remains are those of an adult, possibly male, aged between 17 and 25 years old. The burial dates to the Postclassic.\n\nBurial 17 were excavated from an artificial terrace in east of the centre of Topoxte island, immediately to the southeast of a residential complex. The burial contains the remains of three individuals. The first was an adult male over 30 years old, buried in a seated position with a couple of associated pieces of flint. The remains date to the Postclassic. The second individual was buried prone, oriented northwards, they have been tentatively identified as a male of unknown age. He was interred in the Late Classic with a ceramic vessel, a ceramic bowl and a ceramic disk. The third individual is represented only by a skull, which belonged to a child of between 2 and 5 years of age. The skull was associated with various Early Classic artifacts but it is unclear if it dates from the same period or was deposited during the Postclassic.\n\nBurial 18 was found close to the junction of the lowest tier of Building C with the main stairway of the pyramid. The burial dates to the Postclassic and consists of three individuals. They are of indeterminate gender, one being aged between 12 and 18 years old, the second being aged between 16 and 25 years old and the other being aged between 25 and 35 years old. The entire burial dates to the Postclassic.\n\nBurial 19 was found in the southern part of Topoxte island, under the platform supporting Building A. The burial consists of two individuals and two additional skulls. Both individuals are adult males of between 17 and 25 years of age, with offerings consisting of a shell and various pieces of worked stone including flint, limestone and jasper. The entire burial has been dated to the Protoclassic (AD 0–250).\n\nBurial 20 was located in a system of artificial caves in the southern part of the island, near Building A. It consists of an adult of indeterminate age and gender associated with a great deal of mixed rubbish. The remains date to the Protoclassic.\n\nBurial 21 was found under the temple at the summit of Building C when archaeologists investigated a looters' tunnel. It dates to the Postclassic and was an adult male aged between 35 and 50 years of age, lying horizontally with an east-west orientation. There were few graves goods recovered, a monochrome vessel with a lid containing three small pieces of jade, a piece of quartz crystal, a shell bead and some pieces of turquoise.\n\nBurial 22 is a collection of disarticulated longbones, belonging to a young child of between 2½ to 4 years old, buried at the base of a stela on the third tier of Building C.\n\nBurial 23 was found inserted into the east side of the third tier of Building C. The burial was contained in a cist, with the remains aligned north-south. The skull was missing and the burial had no associated grave goods. The remains belonged to an adult female of between 23 and 30 years of age and date to the Postclassic.\n\nBurial 24 was excavated between Buildings C and D, to the north of Stela 4 and Altar 4. The bones are those of an adult of unknown gender between 17 and 25 years old. The remains had a flint knife under the lower spine and date to the Postclassic.\n\nBurial 25 consists of dispersed human bones of both sexes, scattered on an artificial terrace to the east of Building H and surrounded by residential buildings. The remains have been dated to the Postclassic but could be a Late Preclassic burial disturbed at a later date.\n\nBurial 26 was found on the southern shore of Topoxte island. The remains are those of an infant aged between 2 and 5 years old. The bones were contained within an urn and the burial is dated to the Postclassic.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "609421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=609421", "title": "Uniface", "text": "Uniface\n\nIn archeology, a uniface is a specific type of stone tool that has been flaked on one surface only. There are two general classes of uniface tools: modified flakes—and formalized tools, which display deliberate, systematic modification of the marginal edges, evidently formed for a specific purpose. \n\nWhile many worked stone tools can be technically designated as \"modified flakes,\" for lithic analysis purposes a modified flake is usually defined as a lithic flake with one or more edges that were altered either through opportunistic use or through nonsystematic retouching; it is often difficult to identify the process that produced the observed edge. Opportunistic use occurs when a sharp flake is used as-is, without edge-modification. Nonsystematic retouching occurs when pressure flaking is used to remove a few trimming flakes from the edge, in no discernible or extensive pattern.\n\nSome unifaces are characterized by systematic edge retouch, which was used to thin, straighten, sharpen, and smooth an artifact's edge, and were usually created with a specific purpose in mind. These formalized unifaces were often intended for woodworking, cutting, chopping, or hide-working purposes, and generally fall into easily classifiable types. While the following discussion does not cover some specialized types of unifaces, it does include the most common types.\n\nScrapers are unifacial tools that were used either for hideworking or woodworking. Whereas this term is often used for any unifacially flaked tool that defies classification, most lithic analysts maintain that the only true scrapers are defined on the base of use-wear, and are usually worked at their distal ends—i.e., \"end scrapers.\" Other scrapers include the so-called \"side scrapers.\" Most scrapers are either oval or blade-like in shape. The working edges of scrapers tend to be convex, and many have trimmed and dulled lateral edges to facilitate hafting. One important variety of scraper is the thumbnail scraper, a scraper shaped much like its namesake. This scraper type is common at Paleo-Indian sites.\n\nGouges (or adzes) may be either bifacial or unifacial, and are defined as tools with chisel-like working edges that were used for woodworking purposes; they may also have been used to remove marrow from bones. Gouges are generally triangular in shape, with the working edge—characteristically steep-angled—appearing at the wide base of the triangle. The opposite edge, at the point of the triangle, was the hafted end; the tool itself was generally hafted at right angles to the handle.\n\nDenticulate tools display edges that are worked into a multiply notched shape, much like the toothed edge of a saw. Indeed, these tools might have been used as saws, more likely for meat processing than for wood. It is possible, however, that some or all of these notches were used for smoothing wooden shafts or for similar purposes.\n"}

It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King Ammisaduqa (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after Hammurabi. Thus, the origins of this text should probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC. (according to the Middle Chronology).\n\nThe tablet recorded the rise times of Venus and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the heliacal risings and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These observations are recorded for a period of 21 years.\n\nThis Venus tablet is part of \"Enuma anu enlil\" (\"In the days of Anu and Enlil\"), a long text dealing with Babylonian astrology, which mostly consists of omens interpreting celestial phenomena.\n\nThe earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC cuneiform, part of the British Museum collections, was recovered from the library at Nineveh. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and George Smith as \"Enuma Anu Enlil\" Tablet 63, in \"Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences\" (\"The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia\", volume III).\n\nAs many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups. The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source \"B\", found at Kish in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while Sargon II was King of Assyria between 720 and 704 BC.\n\nSeveral dates for the original observations, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, Middle, Low and Ultra-Low Chronologies, were inferred for the beginning of the Venus observations: 1702 BC, 1646 BC, 1582 BC, 1550 BC, respectively.\n\nThe tablet's significance for corroborating Babylonian chronology was first recognised by Franz Xaver Kugler in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic \"Year of the Golden Throne\" (\"Venus\" tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names. \n\nSince then, this 7th-century BC copy has been variously interpreted to support several chronologies in the 2nd millennium BC.\nMany uncertainties remain about the interpretation of the record of astronomical observations of Venus, as preserved in these surviving tablets. Some copying corruptions are probable. Problems of atmospheric refraction were addressed by Vahe Gurzadyan in a 2003 publication. The entry for some years, notably 13 and 21 are not physically possible and are considered in error. Also, the tables used to calculate the helical rising of Venus assume a rate at which the earth is slowing, a rate which is not certain, causing \"clock-time errors\".\n\nYear 1 inferior Venus sets on Shabatu 15 and after 3 days rises on Shabatu 18\n\nYear 2 superior Venus vanishes E on Arahsamnu 21 and after 1 month 25 days appears W on Tebetu 16\n\nYear 3 inferior Venus sets on Ululu 29 and after 16 days rises on Tashritu 15\n\nYear 4 superior Venus vanishes E on Dumuzi 3 and after 2 months 6 days appears W on Ululu 9\n\nYear 5 inferior Venus sets on Nisan 29 and after 12 days rises on Ayar 11\n\nYear 5 superior Venus vanishes E on Kislimu 27 and after 2 months 3 days appears W on Shabatu 30\n\nYear 6 inferior Venus sets on Arahsamnu 28 and after 3 days rises on Kislimu 1\n\nYear 7 superior Venus vanishes E on Abu 30 and after 2 months appears W on Tashritu 30\n\nYear 8 inferior Venus sets on Dumuzi 9 and after 17 days rises on Dumuzi 26\n\nYear 8 superior Venus vanishes E on Adar 27 and after 2 months 16 days appears W on Simanu 13\n\nYear 9 inferior Venus sets on Adar 12 and after 2 days rises on Adar 14\n\nYear 10 superior Venus vanishes E on Arahsamnu 17 and after 1 month 25 days appears W on Tebetu 12\n\nYear 11 inferior Venus sets on Ululu 25 and after 16 days rises on II Ululu 11\n\nYear 12 superior Venus vanishes E on Ayar 29 and after 2 months 6 days appears W on Abu 5\n\nYear 13 inferior Venus sets on Nisan 25 and after 12 days rises on Ayar 7\n\nYear 13 superior Venus vanishes E on Tebetu 23 and after 2 months 3 days appears W on Adar 26\n\nYear 14 inferior Venus sets on Arahsamnu 24 and after 3 days rises on Arahsamnu 27\n\nYear 15 superior Venus vanishes E on Abu 26 and after 2 months appears W on Tashritu 26\n\nYear 16 inferior Venus sets on Dumuzi 5 and after 16 days rises on Dumuzi 21\n\nYear 16 superior Venus vanishes E on Adar 24 and after 2 months 15 days appears W on Simanu 9\n\nYear 17 inferior Venus sets on Adar 8 and after 3 days rises on Adar 11\n\nYear 18 superior Venus vanishes E on Arahsamnu 13 and after 1 month 25 days appears W on Tebetu 8\n\nYear 19 inferior Venus sets on II Ululu 20 and after 17 days rises on Tashritu 8\n\nYear 20 superior Venus vanishes E on Simanu 25 and after 2 months 6 days appears W on Ululu 1\n\nYear 21 inferior Venus sets on Nisan 22 and after 11 days rises on Ayar 3\n\nYear 21 superior Venus vanishes E on Tebetu 19 and after 2 months 3 days appears W on Adar 22\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5307055", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5307055", "title": "Vital heat", "text": "Vital heat\n\nVital heat, also called innate or natural heat, or calidum innatum, is a term in Ancient Greek medicine and philosophy that has generally referred to the heat produced within the body, usually the heat produced by the heart and the circulatory system. Vital heat was a somewhat controversial subject because it was formerly believed that heat was acquired by an outside source such as the element of fire.\n\nIt was a previously accepted concept that heat was absorbed through external sources, however the concept of vital heat was more or less stumbled upon by a physiological observation that associates cold with the dead and heat with the living. \"For the concept of vital heat we may--somewhat arbitrarily-- take our starting point in Parmenides. His correlation of dead with cold, alive with warm, may not have been primarily intended as a contribution to physiology, yet the physiological significance of this thought was perceived by his successors; witness Empedocles, who taught 'sleep comes about when the heat of the blood is cooled to the proper degree, death when it becomes altogether cold'\". Aristotle would eventually modify this doctrine stating that \"sleep is a temporary overpowering of the inner heat by other factors in the body, death its final extinction.\"\n\nAccording to Ancient Greek physicians, vital heat was produced by the heart, maintained by the \"pneuma\" (air, breath, spirit or soul), and circulated throughout the body by blood vessels, which were thought to be intact tubes using blood to transmit heat. Aristotle supported this argument by showing that when the heart is made cold compared to other organs, the individual dies. He believed that the heat produced in the heart caused blood to react in a similar way to boiling, expanding out through the blood vessels with every beat. This extreme heat, according to him, can lead to a self-consuming flame if it is not cooled by air from the lungs.\n\nGalen wrote in \"On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body\" (170): \"The heart is, as it were, the hearthstone and source of the innate heat by which the animal is governed.\" In the 11th century, Avicenna agreed with this notion, stating that the heart produced breath, the \"vital power or innate heat\" within the body, in his \"Canon of Medicine\".\n\nLater, the term \"innate heat\" was attributed to friction caused by the motion of blood through arteries, as evidenced by the \"Cyclopaedia\" (1728):\n\nAristotle believed that the source of vital heat lies in the heart and is intimately connected to the soul. \"This link is not for Aristotle simply an accidental connection, but rather the existence of vital heat is necessitated by the most basic living activity: nutrition. In De anima ii 4.416b28-29, Aristotle says: 'All food must be capable of being digested, and that whose activity causes digestion is heat. For this reason, every animate thing has heat.'\". Although prominent scholars like Aristotle accepted this concept of innate heat and its role in digestion, there were others who were skeptical and retained a different point of view. \"However, if we look for antecedents of Aristotle's theories, the most important are probably to found in the \"Timaeus\". Here Plato shows in some detail how in respiration the 'Hot' in us is cooled by the air which enters from outside, and he relies on the cutting power of the fire, which here is identical to the 'Hot', to explain the process of digestion \nAlong with his theory of the role of vital heat in nutrition and digestion, Aristotle believed that vital heat played a role in reproduction which includes several physical parts of the body different from the parts that participate in nutrition. Aristotle believed that blood was created through the process of digestion via vital heat and then pushed to the extremities of the body. However, blood is not in its final form but is transformed to a final substance to be used for the nourishment of the body. \"Aristotle holds that semen is nutriment in its final stage of concoction before it becomes part of the body. Hence, blood, before it turns into flesh, bones, etc., first turns into semen.\" Although blood is not in its final form, it can still be used to nourish the body and create flesh and bone. \"Young males do not have semen because the conversion into flesh and bone must be done quickly owing to their rapid growth. And women do not have semen because they are not as hot as men and so lack the power of concocting blood into semen.\" Blood in women is then naturally used to explain the menses. Therefore, when a male and female copulate and semen is emitted in the woman, the menses and the semen mix and begin a process that creates a new organism. \"That it is the heat of the semen that gives it the power to concoct the menses is shown, according to Aristotle by the fact that in some insects which do not produce semen the female inserts a part of her body into the male which then is acted upon by the heat of the male\".\n\n"}

The Challenges to America's National Identity\n\nWho Are We? The Challenges to America's National Identity (2004) is a treatise by political scientist and historian Samuel P. Huntington (1927–2008). The book attempts to understand the nature of American identity and the challenges it will face in the future.\n\nIn describing the American identity, Huntington first contests the notion that the country is, as often repeated, \"a nation of immigrants\". He writes that America's founders were not immigrants, but settlers, since British settlers came to North America to establish a new society, as opposed to migrating from one existing society to another one as immigrants do. Later peoples who joined the culture present in the original British colonies, already established by these settlers, were indeed immigrants.\n\nMany people point to the American Creed as the core of American identity. Huntington defines the American Creed as embodying the \"principles of liberty, equality, individualism, representative government, and private property\". Yet Huntington asks:Would America be the America it is today if in the 17th and 18th centuries it had been settled not by British Protestants but by French, Spanish, or Portuguese Catholics? The answer is no. It would not be America; it would be Quebec, Mexico, or Brazil. Huntington argues that, of all the nations in Europe, and of all the colonies, America alone developed the American Creed, and that this simple observation requires explanation. This observation leads to two conclusions: that America was an English colony, and that America alone was formed as a result of the Reformation.\n\nTo advance his argument about the contribution to America of its English heritage, he says:\n\nAs for the importance of Protestantism, Huntington states: \"The American Creed is the unique creation of a dissenting Protestant culture\". In particular, he highlights the:\n\nHuntington argues that it is during the 1960s that American identity begins to erode. This was the result of several factors:\n\n\nHuntington places the passage and subsequent misinterpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 at the center of government actions that eroded the American Creed. Huntington writes:Senator Hubert Humphrey, the floor manager of the bill, assured the Senate that nothing in the bill gave courts or executive agencies the power \"to require hiring, firing, or promotion of employees in order to meet a racial 'quota' or to achieve a certain balance…Title VII prohibits discrimination…[and] is designed to encourage hiring on the basis of ability and qualifications, not race or religion.\" Yet these acts gave rise to a system of quotas and affirmative action, so that \"the Court derived from Title VII a legal requirement that the proponents of the law had expressly disclaimed\".\n\nAnother component of American identity that Huntington sees as under attack is the use of English. Up until the late 20th century, English has been the dominant language of America and was actively taught to immigrants. This was not only because Americans throughout history had spoken this language, but also because, with a variety of languages brought by different immigrant groups to the United States, teaching everyone to learn to speak and write English ensured communication among these groups. This tradition was inadvertently undermined by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of \"national origin\". The act was interpreted to mean that potential voters who did not speak English were entitled to assistance under this \"national origin\" clause so that they would not be disadvantaged. This led to bilingual voting ballots and the beginning of bilingual education. In 1974, the Civil Rights Act \"was amended to require schools to provide instruction in a student's native language and culture 'to the extent necessary to allow the child to progress effectively through the education system. However, Huntington states that the result was, as stated by 1985 Secretary of Education William Bennett, that the program became:a way of enhancing students' knowledge of their native language and culture. Bilingual education was no longer seen so much as a means to ensure that students learned English, or as a transitional method until students learned English. Rather, it became an emblem of cultural pride, a means of producing a positive self-image in the student.Finally, the single most imposing challenge to America, in Huntington's view, is the problem of Mexican immigration and the resulting \"Hispanization\" of those regions of the United States adjacent to and acquired from Mexico. He fears that the result of Mexican immigration could be a \"bifurcated\" America. Huntington argues that Mexican immigration differs from previous waves of immigration in several fundamental ways, including:\n\n\nNot only does Mexican immigration differ from previous immigration in these ways, but Huntington argues that Mexicans lag other immigrants in their assimilation into American society for several reasons, including:\n\n\nHuntington argues that these differences are the result of cultural differences between American Anglo Protestant culture and Hispanic \"culture of Catholicism\". Lionel Sosa, a Texas Mexican-American businessman, summarizes these differences as \"mistrust of people outside the family; lack of initiative, self-reliance, and ambition; low priority for education; acceptance of poverty as a virtue necessary for entrance into heaven\".\nHuntington argues that this persistent pattern of a massive influx of immigrants from Latin America, especially Mexico, has already resulted in changes in culture, business, language, and education in the Southwestern United States. If the trend continues, this could result in the consolidation of this part of the country into a distinct cultural bloc within the United States that threatens to bifurcate America.\nFinally, Huntington lists other ways in which America's identity has weakened. These include: the collapse of the Soviet Union left the United States without an enemy against which to define itself; the denationalization of business, professional, intellectual, and academic elites; and the influence of diasporas. By \"denationalization\", Huntington means that these Americans think of themselves mostly as members of an international community and not really as citizens of the United States.\n\nAfter laying out the concerns for the weakening and subsequent dissolution of America, which could plausibly occur due to cultural bifurcation and/or a government formed of denationalized elites that increasingly ignore the will of the public, Huntington attempts to formulate a solution to these problems. He argues that adherence to the American Creed is by itself not enough to sustain an American identity. An example of a state that attempted to use ideology alone was the Soviet Union, which attempted to impose communism on different cultures and nationalities, and eventually collapsed. A similar fate could lie in store for the United States unless Americans \"participate in American life, learn America's language [English], history, and customs, absorb America's Anglo-Protestant culture, and identify primarily with America rather than with their country of birth\". In particular, Huntington suggests that Americans turn to Protestantism, and recognize that what distinguishes America from other countries is that it is an extremely religious Western country, founded on the principles of the Enlightenment and Protestant Reformation.\n\nOn the year of the book's release, Alan Wolfe of \"Foreign Affairs\" wrote, \"to claim that there exists a common 'Anglo-Protestant culture...' ignores the fact that Protestants have disagreed vehemently with each other over what that culture is.\" He furthermore argued that \"Huntington fails to appreciate the degree to which immigrants shaped American culture even as they assimilated\" and that the liberal elites he criticizes \"include disproportionately large numbers of the Anglo-Protestants whose culture Huntington wants to celebrate.\" Michiko Kakutani of the \"New York Times\" further criticized it as \"recycling arguments made by a wide array of earlier thinkers... while glossing masses of research with decidedly subjective analysis\" and as \"riddled with gross generalizations... and equally questionable assertions\"\n\nAs the 2013 \"Washington Post\" article by Dylan Matthews challenged Huntington's points, arguing that Latino immigrants have been adapting to English just as quickly as Asian and European immigrants have as of 2000, that proficiency in English and support for English as the official language of the United States among Latino Americans increased over generational status, and that Hispanic Americans are no less religious or hard-working than white Americans are.\n\nIn 2017, \"Washington Post\" book critic Carlos Lozada penned an editorial describing Huntington's works as \"[anticipating] America's political and intellectual battles -- and [pointing] to the country we may become.\" He states that Huntington \"captures the dissonance between working classes and elites, between nationalism and cosmopolitanism, that played out in the 2016 campaign.\" He also comments that Huntington's expressed in \"Clash of Civilizations\" and \"Who Are We?\" contrast sharply with those he expressed in his 1981 work \"American Politics: The Promise of Disharmony\", wherein Huntington argues that Americans are primarily united by a classically liberal creed rather than \"ethnic identity or religious faith.\" Lozada goes on to challenge criticism of Huntington's ideas as \"single-minded,\" stating that \"Huntington foresees an America roiled by self-doubt, white nationalism and enmity against Islam.\" However, he concedes that Huntington offers a \"narrow view of American uniqueness,\" ultimately warning against isolationism, \"demonizing newcomers and demanding cultural fealty.\"\n\n"}

Xuan paper is renowned for being soft and fine textured, suitable for conveying the artistic expression of both Chinese calligraphy and painting.\n\nXuan paper was first mentioned in ancient Chinese books \"Notes of Past Famous Paintings\" and \"New Book of Tang\". It was originally produced in the Tang dynasty in Jing County, which was under the jurisdiction of Xuan Prefecture (Xuanzhou), hence the name Xuan paper. During the Tang dynasty, the paper was often a mixture of hemp (the first fiber used for paper in China) and mulberry fiber. By the Song dynasty, the paper producing industries in Huizhou and Chizhou were gradually transferred to Jing County.\n\nDue to different producing methods, Xuan paper can be classified into \"Shengxuan\", \"Shuxuan\", and \"Banshuxuan\". Shengxuan (literally \"Raw Xuan\"), which is not specially processed, excels in its ability to absorb water, causing the ink on it to blur. Shuxuan (literally \"Ripe Xuan\"), however, has Potassium alum worked into it during production, which results in a stiffer texture, a reduced ability to absorb water, and less resistance to shear stress (meaning that it can be torn much more easily). This feature makes Shuxuan more suitable for Gongbi rather than Xieyi. Banshuxuan (literally \"Half-ripe Xuan\") has intermediate absorbability, between Shengxuan and Shuxuan.\n\nXuan paper features great tensile strength, smooth surface, pure and clean texture and clean stroke, great resistance to crease, corrosion, moth and mold. The majority of ancient Chinese books and paintings by famous painters that survived until today are well preserved on Xuan paper. Xuan paper won the Golden Award at the Panama International Exposition in 1915. Xuan paper was used to make scrolls.\n\nThe material Xuan paper uses is closely related to the geography of Jing County. The bark of \"Pteroceltis tatarinowii\", a common species of elm in the area, was used as the main material to produce Xuan paper. Rice, along with several other materials, was subsequently added to the recipe in the Song and Yuan Dynasties. Bamboo and mulberry also began to be used to produce xuan paper around that time.\n\nThe production of Xuan paper can be loosely described as an 18-step process, and a detailed account would involve over a hundred. Some paper makers have invented steps which have been kept secret from others. The process includes steaming and bleaching the bark of \"Pteroceltis tatarinowii\", as well as the addition of a variety of juices.\n\n\n"}

It is currently developed by Big Viking Games. The game operates on the freemium model, and is supported through microtrasactions, as well as a voluntary in-game ad program. The game itself is free-to-play, however, players can purchase in-game currencies or enroll in special programs and offers to improve their game-play experience or help them progress faster, using real money. \n\nUsers can create a virtual avatar, and enter the virtual world. Within YoWorld, players can earn virtual coins and currencies (like \"YoCoins\" and \"YoCash\") in-game by completing various jobs and tasks in-game. They can also purchase more with real money. \"YoWorlders\" can then use these funds to purchase and decorate new homes, purchase more clothing and gear for their avatars, adopt pets, or even take advantage of the game's virtual economy, and make investments by buying, selling, and trading items with other players. Other activities in-game include mini-games, hosting parties, socializing and chatting with other users, and role-play. The game is currently available on the social media platform, Facebook, as a browser-based game. It can also be accessed through Facebook's Game Room platform.\n\nThe game was originally released and developed by Tall Tree Games in 2008. That same year, the game was purchased by gaming giant Zynga, inspiring other later titles like FarmVille and CityVille. Tall Tree Games was the original name for the game's current company, Big Viking Games, who sought to acquire the game back from Zynga after its closure was announced on January 10, 2014. The announcement of the game's closure led to months of organized virtual in-game protests, and boycott threats from passionate fans towards Zynga. Throughout these months, negotiation took place between Zynga and Big Viking Games, which eventually concluded with the decision to allow the game to continue running with Big Viking Games as its new developers. The acquisition came with re-branding the game, from \"YoVille\" to \"YoWorld.\"\n\nWithin the virtual world, users can do a variety of things. These include purchasing new homes, building new homes, decorating them, stylizing their avatar however they see fit, adopting pets, role-playing, meeting new people, and socializing. The game is pretty much a life-simulation, and players can live it as they please. To keep the game interesting, the developers regularly release new \"themes\" within the game. Themes are new furniture, clothing, pets, and housing lines that are released all in correlation with one another. Themes can be based on or inspired by a number of things, such as holidays, real-life locations, time periods and eras, stories and folklore, lifestyles, artistic movements, and genres of fiction. \n\nTo make money, players can take on jobs, or perform daily tasks and collect bonuses, like opening free mystery chests they receive from friends. They can also participate in the game's virtual economy by buying, selling, and trading virtual goods, such as furniture and clothing. Watching ads is also another way of making free YoCoins within the game. \n\nYoWorld has its own map filled with public locations, as well as various hangouts players can go to meet new people, such as, but not limited to, a vintage diner and a nightclub. YoWorlders can also make posts and participate in discussion on the YoWorld Forums, where they can give feedback for new themes, features, and assets they'd like to see in-game.\n\n\n"}
