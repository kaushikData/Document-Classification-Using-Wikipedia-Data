The text is lost and survives only in fragments. Brutus, dissatisfied with Cicero's work, wrote a second pamphlet in praise of Cato and called, simply, \"Cato,\" which provoked a reply from Octavian. Octavian's work is not known to have been called Anticato but must have been modeled on Caesar's reply to Cicero.\n\nCato was a famously stubborn Stoic, who came into conflict with Caesar at the Catiline conspiracy trial. Cato argued for capital punishment for Lucius Sergius Catilina and his conspirators, so as to set an example and discourage similar treason. Caesar argued for a private judgement and clemency. The Senate agreed with Cato, and the executions were carried out; the rebel army disbanded and fled. During the debate, however, Cato had called out Caesar for reading personal messages in the Senate; Caesar defended himself, saying he was only reading a love letter. Cato insisted on reading it, and to widespread dismay, it was what Caesar said—exposing his affair with Servilia, the half-sister of Cato. Servilia was forced to divorce.\n\nNext, during the triumvirate of Caesar, Pompey, and Marcus Licinius Crassus, Cato interfered with Caesar's plans for a triumph for himself, while supporting one for Pompey. Cato opposed Caesar's every political step afterward, in particular leading the opposition to Caesar's return to Rome in 49 BC without relinquishing his proconsulship. Caesar famously crossed the Rubicon and came to Rome regardless, sparking the Roman Civil War. When Caesar prevailed in the war and looked to seize power in Rome, Cato committed suicide.\n\nSeveral leading Romans wrote works in posthumous praise or criticism of Cato. A famous panegyric by Cicero titled simply \"Cato\" led to Caesar writing his \"Anticato\" in response.\n\n"}
{"id": "26973774", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26973774", "title": "Arab Cold War", "text": "Arab Cold War\n\nThe Arab Cold War ( \"al-Harb al-`Arabbiyah al-bārdah\") was a series of conflicts in the Arab world between the new republics led by Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and espousing Arab nationalism, Arab socialism, and Pan-Arabism and the more traditionalist kingdoms, led by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The period of conflict began following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 and the rise to power of Nasser, and lasted until 1970, when he died, although others think it lasted until the final end of the Cold War in 1991.\n\nDespite its beginnings during the global Cold War and era of European decolonization, and its links and interactions to that wider Cold War, the Arab Cold War was not a clash between capitalist and Marxist–Leninist regimes. The two sides were Arab nationalist republics, usually quasi-socialist and Pan-Arabist in orientation, and the traditional monarchies, usually with quasi-feudal or rentierist economic structures. The leading Arab nationalist state during this period was Egypt, closely followed by and in competition with Syria (with which Egypt briefly united to form the United Arab Republic from 1958 to 1961). The leading conservative monarchy was Saudi Arabia, with Jordan (and initially Iraq) reluctantly falling in the same but competing camp.\n\nAlthough in theory, almost all of the Arab states were non-aligned during this period, in practice, the nationalist republics, with the notable exception of Lebanon, were allied to the Soviet Union even as most of them ruthlessly suppressed the communist parties within their countries while the conservative monarchies generally received military help from the United States.\n\nThe expression \"Arab Cold War\" was coined by American political scientist and Middle East scholar Malcolm H. Kerr, in his 1965 book of that title, and subsequent editions.\n\nOver the period, the history of the Arab states varies widely. In 1956, the year of the Suez Crisis, only Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Tunisia, and Sudan, among the Arab states were republics; all, to some degree, subscribed to the Arab nationalist ideology, or at least paid lip-service to it. Jordan and Iraq were both Hashemite monarchies; Morocco, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and North Yemen all had independent dynasties; and Algeria, South Yemen, Oman, and the Trucial States remained under colonial rule. By 1960, Iraq, Tunisia, Algeria, and North Yemen had republican governments or Arab nationalist insurgencies while Lebanon had a near-civil war between US-aligned and Arab nationalist factions within the government.\n\nBecause conflicts in the period varied over time and with different locations and perspectives, it is dated differently, depending on sources. Jordanian sources, for example, date the commencement of the Arab Cold War to April 1957, while Palestinian sources note the period of 1962 to 1967 as being most significant to them but within the larger Arab context.\n\nIn 1952 King Farouk of Egypt was deposed by the Free Officers Movement under a program to dismantle feudalism and end British influence in Egypt. In 1953 the officers, led by Nasser, abolished the monarchy and declared Egypt a Republic. On 26 July 1956, Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal, following the withdrawal of an offer by Britain and the United States to fund the building of the Aswan Dam, which was in response to Egypt's new ties with the Soviet Union. Britain, France, and Israel responded by occupying the Canal but were forced to back off in what is known as the Suez Crisis. Nasser \"emerged\" from the crisis with great prestige, as the \"unchallenged leader of Arab nationalism\".\n\nNasser employed a number of political instruments in order to raise his profile across the Arab world – from radio programs such as the Voice of the Arabs to the organised dispatch of politically-active Egyptian professionals, usually teachers.\nIn July 1958, the Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq was overthrown, with the king, crown prince and prime minister all killed by the nationalist revolutionaries. Iraq's monarchy was also replaced by a republic with an Arab nationalist orientation. Forces supporting Nasser and nationalism seemed ascendant, and older Arab monarchies seemed in peril. In 1969, yet another Arab kingdom fell, when the Free Officers Movement of Libya, a group of rebel military officers led by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, overthrew the Kingdom of Libya led by King Idris.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, Nasser's popularity was such that some Saudi princes (led by Prince Tala bin Abdul Aziz) rallied to his cause of Arab socialism. In 1962, a Saudi Air Force pilot defected to Cairo. There were signs of \"unrest and subversion\" in 1965 and 1966, \"especially\" in Saudi's oil producing region. In 1969, a Nasserist plot was uncovered by the Saudi government \"involving 28 army officer, 34 air force officers, nine other military personnel, and 27 civilians.\"\n\nIn the early 1960s, Nasser sent an expeditionary army to Yemen to support the anti-monarchist forces in the North Yemen Civil War. Yemen royalists were supported by Saudi Arabia and Jordan (both monarchies). Egyptian air power struck Saudi border towns like Najran in December 1962.\n\nBy the late 1960s, Nasser's prestige was diminished by the political failure of the political union of Egypt and Syria, and the military failures in Yemen where the civil war stalemated despite his commitment of thousands of troops to overthrow the monarchists, and especially with Israel where Egypt lost the Sinai Peninsula and 10,000 to 15,000 troops killed during the Six-Day War. In late 1967, Nasser and Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal signed a treaty under which Nasser would pull out his 20,000 troops from Yemen, Faisal would stop sending arms to Yemen royalists, and three neutral Arab states would send in observers.\n\nThough far smaller in population than Egypt, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had oil wealth and prestige as the land of Mecca and Medina, the two holy cities of Islam. To use Islam as a counterweight to Nasser's Arab socialism, Saudi Arabia sponsored an international Islamic conference in Mecca in 1962. It created the Muslim World League, dedicated to spreading Islam and fostering Islamic solidarity. The League was \"extremely effective\" in promoting Islam, particularly conservative Wahhabi Islam, and also served to combat \"radical alien ideologies\" (such as Arab socialism) in the Muslim world.\n\nParticularly after the Six Day War, Islamic revival strengthened throughout the Arab World. After Nasser's death in 1970, his successor, Anwar Sadat, emphasized religion and economic liberalization rather than Arab nationalism and socialism. In Egypt's \"shattering\" 1967 defeat, \"Land, Sea and Air\" had been the military slogan. In the perceived victory of the 1973 war, it was replaced with the pious battle cry of \"Allahu Akbar\". While some argue Israel's counterattack belied claims of Arab victory, the Saudi-led oil embargo was a major success.\n\nIn Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, which had been suppressed by the Egyptian government and aided by Saudi Arabia, was allowed to publish a monthly magazine, and its political prisoners were gradually released. At universities, Islamists took control and drove (anti-Sadat) student leftist and Pan-Arabist organizations underground. By the late 1970s, Sadat called himself 'The Believer President'. He banned most sales of alcohol and ordered Egypt's state-run television to interrupt programs with salat (call to prayer) on the screen five times a day and to increase religious programming.\n\n"}

It is located at Pune in Maharashtra state. The institute was founded in 1910 by the veteran Indian historian Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade and Sardar K. C. Mehendale.\n\nThe main objective behind setting up the \"Mandal\" was to provide ready resources to the historians and researchers, to save their time and to motivate them. Rajwade conceived this idea long back but could not fulfill it until Sardar Mehendale met him and on his own expressed his readiness to support him for anything that he wished to do for the betterment of history.\n\nThe \"Mandal\" was founded on 7 July 1910 by the veteran Indian historian Vishwanath Kashinath Rajwade and Sardar Khanderao Chintaman Mehendale at Sardar Mehendale’s palace at Appa Balwant Chowk in Pune. To commence the activity Rajwade read an essay in the presence of the only listener Sardar Mehendale. Later on, the \"Mandal\" moved to its present building located in Sadashiv Peth area in the heart of the city. In March 1926 the short tempered Rajwade left Pune due to differences with the then Administrators of the \"Mandal\" and shifted to Dhule to form another institute which was named after him as ‘Rajwade Sanshodhan Mandir’. The \"Mandal\" at Pune, however, continued following on its mission to help researchers and contribute to the progress of historical study. It has since then been highly supported by the people and scholars by way of donations and bequests of books and papers. Rajwade’s disciples Datto Vaman Potdar, Ganesh Hari Khare and Vasudeo Sitaram Bendrey are believed to have played major role in prospering the \"Mandal\" and its activities.\n\nPresently, the \"Mandal\" maintains more than 1,500,000 historical papers and scripts mainly in Marathi, Modi, Persian, Portuguese and English languages. Moreover, it has also preserved over , and a few sculptures and inscriptions in its well equipped museum. The \"Mandal\"’s library keeps a more than books written mainly in Marathi and English which can be available to the researchers for free reading or for a nominal fee on ‘Take Home’ basis. These resources hold sizeable volumes on the history of Maratha Empire, Maratha culture and Marathi literature. They also contain a large collection of the material on British Rule as well as Mughal Rule over India. The \"Mandal\" issues a Quarterly Journal called ‘Trai-Masik’ wherein essays and articles on new discoveries are presented. It has also published books written and edited by veteran historians and reports of annual conferences and historians' meets. The \"Mandal\" periodically organises lectures, workshops, training, seminars and study tours for the young researchers and historians.\n\nIt was reported in 2004 that the \"Mandal\" was insufficiently funded to micro-film or digitise its collection. In 2009, as it entered its 100th year, it plans to create a permanent fund of Ten Million Rupees and use the interest from this fund to pay its expenses.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1219664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1219664", "title": "Cantometrics", "text": "Cantometrics\n\nCantometrics (\"song measurements\") is a method developed by Alan Lomax and a team of researchers for relating elements of the world's traditional vocal music (or folk songs) to features of social organization as defined via George Murdock's Human Relations Area Files, resulting in a taxonomy of expressive human communications style. Lomax defined Cantometrics as the study of singing as normative expressive behavior and maintained that Cantometrics reveals folk performance style to be a \"systems-maintaining framework\" which models key patterns of co-action in everyday life. His work on Cantometrics gave rise to further comparative studies of aspects of human communication in relation to culture, including: Choreometrics, Parlametrics, Phonotactics (an analysis of vowel frequency in speech), and Minutage (a study of breath management). \n\nInstead of the traditional Western musicological descriptive criteria of pitch, rhythm, and harmony, Cantometrics employs 37 style factors developed by Lomax and his team in consultation with specialists in linguistics, otolaryngology and voice therapy. The vocal style factors were designed to be easily rated by observers on a five-point scale according to their presence or absence. They include, for example: group cohesion in singing; orchestral organization; tense or relaxed vocal quality; breathiness; short or long phrases; rasp (vocal grating, such as associated, for example with the singing of Louis Armstrong); presence and percentage of vocables versus meaningful words); and melisma (ornamentation), to name a few. \n\nIn the early stages of his work on the Cantometrics coding system, Lomax wrote of the relationship of musical style to culture:\"Its fundamental diagnostic traits appear to be vocal quality (color, timbre, normal pitch, attack, type of melodic ornamentation, etc.) and the degree in which song is normally monodic or polyphonic. The determinative socio-psychological factors seem to be . . . the type of social organization, the pattern of erotic life, and the treatment of children... I myself believe that the voice quality is the root [diagnostic] element. From this socio-psychological complex there seem to arise a complex of habitual musical practices which we call musical style\" \n\nLomax first publicly proposed the Cantometrics project in 1959 and launched a group project in conjunction with the Anthropology Department at Columbia University to implement his vision. Early collaborators included musicologist Victor Grauer, who was the first co-creator with Lomax of the Cantometrics computer coding system. Subsequent project members included distinguished Columbia University anthropologist Conrad M. Arensberg, a founder of applied anthropology; anthropologists Edwin Erickson and Barbara Ayres; and statistician Norman Berkowitz. Laban shape notation specialist Irmgard Bartenieff and dancer and movement therapist Forrestine Paulay co-created the Choreometrics movement coding system, for analyzing dance, mapping the movement of the torso, hands, feet, and use of performance space. In 1968 Lomax's research team published a book, \"Folk Song Style and Culture\", in which they stated that, \"for the first time, predictable and universal relationships have been established between the expressive and communication processes, on the one hand, and social structure and culture pattern, on the other\". \n\nGideon D'Arcangelo, a member of the Cantometrics team, described their work this way:Using 37 criteria of observation, the Cantometrics team analyzed over 4,000 songs – around 10 representative songs from over 400 cultures. Each song profile they made was recorded on a computer punch-card and loaded onto the Columbia mainframe. A companion study of dance, Choreometrics, produced analyses of over 1,500 dance performances. Only a computer was capable of handling this enormous data set and looking for the patterns hidden within. The team, led by programmer Norman Berkowitz, developed a powerful set of statistically driven software tools to sort, separate, and group the performance data. Their analyses resulted in the first ever taxonomy of human performance style and in a series of maps showing the dis-semination of culture across the planet. These were presented to the American Association of Science (1966) and later published in the collaborative volume, \"Folk Song Style and Culture\" (1968).\n\nThe Cantometric study of song revealed strong statistical relations between song style and social norms. Alan Lomax stated that the Cantometrics analysis amply justified his original hypothesis that sexually restrictive and highly punitive societies correlated with degree of vocal tension. The tendency to sing together in groups, tonal cohesiveness, and the likelihood of polyphonic singing were all associated with fewer restrictions on women. Multipart singing occurs in societies where the sexes have a complementary relationship. \n\nOther results included strong correlations between length of phrase and precision of articulation, and degree of ornamentation with social stratification. It was found that explicitness or the information load of song varies with the level of economic productivity of the subsistence system.\n\nMurdock's taxonomy encoded the economic, social, and political features of more than 1,100 societies that ethnologists had studied up until that time. In many cases, these codes formed scales – for example, the one concerning the number of levels of political authority outside the local community, from 0 among hunters, to 4 for irrigation empires. Lomax and Arensberg arranged the codes into scales in order to measure the kinds of behaviors of features of culture, such as levels of production or permanence of settlement. When they added factors of expressive communication to the Murdock measures of social relations it produced a geographical taxonomy of human culture.\n\nThree chapters of \"Folk Song Style and Culture\" are devoted to Choreometrics. In chapter ten, \"Dance, Style, and Culture,\" Lomax, Bartenieff, and Paulay describe the origin and meaning of the term: \"In order to distinguish the level of this comparative study of movement from the levels where previous investigators have worked, we have given the method a freshly-coined designation, Choreometrics, meaning the measure of dance, or dance as a measure of culture.\". They wrote that:\nChoreometrics tests the proposition that dance is the most repetitious, redundant, and formally organized system of body communication present in a culture... The dance is composed of those gestures, postures, movements, and movement qualities most characteristic and most essential to the activity of everyday, and thus crucial to cultural continuity. By treating these elements redundantly and formally, dance becomes an effective organizer of joint motor activity. Dance supplies the metronome to meter and regulates, or orders the energy and attention of groups of people, and thereby acquires the weight of general community approval. Thus dance functions to establish and renew consensus at moments when a society, without further discussion or explanation, is ready to act in concert.\n\nBartenieff believed that dance (particularly traditional dance) was uniquely suited to Lomax's type of analysis, since movement is \"not only a medium of expression but also the essence of communication. Although all dancers feel intuitively that movement communicates across culture barriers, she wrote, there have hitherto been no means for describing dance patterns so that they could be consistently compared cross-culturally: \n\n\"The task on which we collaborated with Mr. Lomax was to adapt the Laban system to the problem of comparison of movement styles cross-culturally so that the main style families would emerge from the study of this visually perceived behavior on film, as in Cantometrics they had been found by study of aurally perceived behavior.\" \n\nA series of short documentary films demonstrated some of the results of the team's statistical analysis in dramatic visual terms. These were: \"Dance & Human History\" (1974) (40 min.), which examined two important parameters in the Choreometric study, the dominant trace form of the movement and single/multiple articulation of the torso and relates them to geography and type of society; \"Palm Play\" (1977) (27 min.), which examines the use of the palm in dance cross culturally; \"Step Style\" (1977) (30 min.), which examines the use of the foot in dance cross culturally; and \"The Longest Trail\" (1984) (59 min.), which uses Choreometric data as evidence that the Americas were populated by Siberian hunters. In 2009 all four films were included on the DVD \"Rhythms of Earth: The Choreometrics Films of Alan Lomax and Forrestine Paulay\" produced by John Melville Bishop (Media-Generation, 1974–2008), which included old and new interviews with the original participants of the study. Improvisational jazz musician and composer Roswell Rudd later collaborated with Lomax and Paulay on an unpublished study called the Urban Strain that used Cantometric and Choreometric analysis to study commercially produced twentieth-century American popular music and dance.\n\nThe reaction of musicologists to Cantometrics was complex, as some critics questioned whether one could ever have enough statistics to prove anything about music and culture. One, Richard Middleton, called it an example of sociological homology.\n\nThe musical examples for Cantometrics had not been chosen randomly, however, but for their representativeness, following the scholarly guidance of specialists who had studied the regions and /or supplied the audio or film clip samples. This was done because it was found that style tends to be very repetitive, and in most instances relatively few examples captured the stable performance norms, so that in most cases, coding many examples per culture yielded little new information. Lomax and Grauer settled on about ten examples per culture for Cantometrics, which had the largest dataset. Ten examples per culture usually sufficed, although for some cultures one or more sub-styles needed to be sampled as well. \n\nAlan Lomax himself stressed repeatedly that completeness of sampling was not the point:\nThe adequacy of any of these samples is . . . subject to this test: Will another sample of a similar kind taken in the same culture produce a similar performance profile? From this point of view, I believe that the majority of our samples will hold up. Even \"secret\" songs generally tend to be stylistically close to the more familiar music of a culture. The truth is that, with any one culture or subculture, singing is a rather standardized kind of behavior. It must be so since a main function of song is to . . . permit groups of performers to vocalize together and their listeners to share in a common experience. Cantometrics is a study of these standardized models, which describe singing rather than songs. Therefore, it is not primarily concerned with \"complete\" collections and descriptions, as are most scholarly endeavors, but with locating verifiable regularities and patterns. (Lomax [1968] 2000).\n\nVictor Grauer noted that: “Cantometrics is a statistical method. Its patterns and correlations are based on multiple instances, not just one. There will always be exceptions, which is why statistical methods are generally preferable for comparative studies than the close examination of individual examples.”\n\nThe Cantometrics team also created a set of teaching tapes that make it easy to develop an understanding of world music and to create new song profiles. “Cantometrics helps you to break music down into its parts,” Roswell Rudd told Gideon D’Arcangelo. “You want to know how it’s put together and then you want to know where the parts came from. The Cantometrics teaching tapes are the best thing anybody can use who wants to understand world music, classical music, pop music, whatever. That teaching kit teaches you about the qualities of music – any kind of music from any culture.” \nAlan Lomax foresaw that computers would be an ideal way to make Cantometrics analysis available not just to scholars but to people of all ages and educational backgrounds, particularly school children. With that end in view, during the 1990s he developed The Global Jukebox, an interactive multi-media computer program designed for classrooms, museums, and libraries to visually and aurally map the world's song and dance cultures, incidentally helping people understand their own roots and those of others, while teaching geography, anthropology, and tolerance through song and dance. Since Alan Lomax's death in 2002, The Association for Cultural Equity, which Lomax founded, has been working to update the program, and make it widely available. In fulfillment of this project, as of March 2012 all the recordings of his Archive will be streamed online.\n\n"}

He uses it to purchase his own amusement park, named \"Cartmanland\". The resulting success causes Kyle to have a hemorrhoid and lose his faith in God. However, Kyle later regains his faith in God when Cartman loses his theme park and owes $13,000 back in taxes. \n\nCartman's grandmother, Mabel Louise Cartman passes away and leaves Cartman one million dollars in inheritance. Rather than invest the money or donate it to good will, Cartman instead uses the money to purchase North Park Funland, an amusement park owned by Frank Fun. Signing off the deeds, Frank however clears his conscience with Cartman, revealing that Funland has been a financial failure. Cartman reassures him that he only intends to open the park for himself, expressing his disdain for park lines. Frank agrees to sell, and the park is renamed Cartmanland.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle upon learning of Cartman's success starts to question his faith in God, and how someone as horrid as Cartman could be so fortunate and happy. To make matters worse, Kyle develops a hemorrhoid due to the stress of knowing Cartman's glee. He and Stan attempt to sneak into Cartmanland, defying Cartman's expulsion of any guests; especially them. Kyle's hemorrhoid pops whilst climbing over the fence into the park and are then found by Cartman who angrily sends them away. The hemorrhoid becomes infected, worsening Kyle's state and being the final straw to fully lose faith in God. Desperate to rekindle hope in Kyle, his parents attempt to cheer him up by telling the story of Job, but they truncate the story with Job getting boils and never mentioning the end where Job regains his good fortune for believing in God despite everything going wrong in his life. The plan backfires however, as Kyle is horrified that God would allow such a devout believer in him to suffer so greatly just to win a bet with Satan.\n\nCartman hires a single security guard to stop further trespassing into his park. But with his inheritance dried up, the guard refuses to work unless he is afforded a viable salary; pointing out that if Cartman lets in two people to the park per day, he could easily pay for his employment. Eventually, one of the rides malfunctions thus forcing Cartman to let more guests in to pay for maintenance. Inevitably, expenses for maintenance, refreshments, utilities and security mount up causing more and more guests to be admitted into the park, which turns out to revive the park as a success at Cartman's disdain for queues. Business experts mistake Cartman's \"you can't come\" technique as a marketing ploy - which proves to be fatal for Kyle, who flat lines. With Cartmanland a thriving success and with record park guests, Cartman becomes infuriated and demands his money back from Mr. Fun. With the park back in Frank's ownership, the IRS collects $500,000 in penalty fees from Cartman as he did not keep tax records of the park. The last $500,000 is taken in a lawsuit by Kenny's parents after Kenny died on one of the rollercoasters. Now $13,000 in debt and completely broken, Cartman pleads to get the park back from Mr. Fun who ultimately refuses.\n\nUpon hearing about the events, Stan hurries to the hospital as Kyle is now on the verge of dying. He pleads with the doctor to take Kyle out of the hospital to show him what is happening to Cartman. They arrive at the park to find Cartman throwing rocks at the walls in anger over having lost his fortune before being maced by the security guard he originally hired. Seeing Cartman's misery causes Kyle's hemorrhoid to miraculously shrink away and he makes a full recovery as he watches Cartman cry after having been pepper sprayed by his former security guard, and his faith in God is now restored.\n\nIn the DVD commentary to this episode, Parker and Stone highlight it as another example (after \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\") of the show's change in style towards simpler ideas which consisted only of an A-Plot, with no subplot, and \"not try[ing] to do too many things at once\". Parker mentions that they almost did not make the episode as they did not believe that there was enough going on in the episode, that it was too \"basic and easy\". Parker also said they were concerned that the story of Cartman inheriting a million dollars and buying a theme park was cliché. However, as it was the middle of the run and they had no other stories ready for production, they decided to run with the idea. Parker said he realised while they were making the episode that \"as long as you have the basic easy cliché thing as the overall thing, then you can get into the scenes and have a lot of fun with scenes and get original in there.\"\n\nBoth this episode and \"Scott Tenorman Must Die\" appear on \"The Cult of Cartman\" DVD.\n\nThe security guard whom Cartman hires and who uses pepper spray was previously the lead mall cop in the season four episode \"Something You Can Do with Your Finger\". He is also featured in the 2014 \"South Park\" video game \"\" as the first boss the player must face, guarding Token Black’s mansion and using his pepper spray on the player character unless they wear a gas mask.\n\n\"Cartmanland\", along with the fourteen other episodes from \"South Park: the Complete Fifth Season\", was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4247025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4247025", "title": "Charlottenhof Palace", "text": "Charlottenhof Palace\n\nCharlottenhof Palace or Charlottenhof Manor () is a former royal palace located southwest of Sanssouci Palace in Sanssouci Park at Potsdam, Germany. It is best known as the summer residence of Crown Prince Frederick William (later King Frederick William IV of Prussia). Today it is maintained by the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg.\n\nThe park area with its various buildings can be traced back to the 18th century. After it had changed hands several times, King Frederick William III of Prussia bought the land that borders the south of Sanssouci Park and gave it to his son Frederick William and his wife Elisabeth Ludovika for Christmas in 1825.\n\nThe Crown Prince charged the architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel with the remodeling of an already existing farm house and the project was completed at low cost from 1826 through 1829. In the end, Schinkel, with the help of his student Ludwig Persius, built a small Neoclassical palace on the foundations of the old farm house in the image of a Roman villa.\n\nWith designs he created himself the artistically inclined Crown Prince participated in the planning process for the palace and surrounding park. He referred to this summer residence as \"Siam\", which at the time was considered \"the Land of the Free\", and to himself jokingly as the \"Siam House architect\".\n\nOfficially the palace and park were named \"Charlottenhof\" in honor of Maria Charlotte von Gentzkow who had owned the property from 1790 to 1794.\n\nThe interior design of the ten rooms is still largely intact. The furniture, for the most part designed by Schinkel himself, is remarkable for its simple and cultivated style.\n\nThe palace's most distinctive room is the tent room fashioned after a Roman Caesar's tent. In the tent room both ceiling and walls are decorated with blue and white striped wallpaper and the window treatments and bed tent and coverings continue that design. The room was used as a bedroom for companions and guests.\n\nThe blue and white theme is continued throughout on the palace's window shutters, it seems, in deference to the Bavarian heritage of then crown princess Elisabeth.\n\nBetween 1835 and 1840 the explorer and world traveler Alexander von Humboldt was invited and stayed in the tent room during the summer months.\n\nThe landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné was charged with the design of the Charlottenhof gardens.\n\nHe completely recreated the originally flat and partly marshy area into an English garden with trees, lawn and water features. He also linked the new park at Charlottenhof to the older one at Sanssouci from the time of Frederick the Great.\n\nSince 1990, Charlottenhof Palace has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin\". The palace is administered by the \"Stiftung Preußische Schlösser und Gärten Berlin-Brandenburg\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40498390", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40498390", "title": "Child of Light", "text": "Child of Light\n\nChild of Light is a platforming role-playing video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft for Microsoft Windows, the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360 and Xbox One in April 2014, and was released on PlayStation Vita in July 2014. The game was later released on Nintendo Switch on 11 October 2018; the announcement of this release also teased a sequel.<ref name=\"Switch/sequel\"></ref> It is powered by UbiArt Framework.\n\nThe game's story takes place in the fictional land of Lemuria. Aurora, a child who wakes up in Lemuria after dying from a mysterious illness, must bring back the sun, the moon, and the stars held captive by the Queen of the Night in order to return home.\n\n\"Child of Light\"s gameplay is described as having attributes of a side-scroller with role-playing elements such as leveling up to increase stats over time. Battles with enemies use a system similar to the active-time battle system found in games like the \"Final Fantasy\" series and the \"Grandia\" series. The player can control up to two characters during battle, and swap these two with waiting characters. Up to three enemies can appear during battle. If the player approaches an enemy from behind, the battle becomes a \"Surprise Strike\", giving the player an advantage. If the enemy approaches the player from behind, it becomes an \"Ambush\", giving the enemy an advantage. The character Igniculus is used as an in-game mechanic outside of and during battle. The player can freely move Igniculus to open chests that Aurora cannot reach, as well as shine his light on an enemy to slow it down or on an ally to heal them.\n\nIn 1895 Austria, a princess named Aurora is born to a Duke, who rules over a kingdom of five hills, and his beautiful, yet mysterious wife. After Aurora's mother apparently died, her father eventually remarried. On Easter Eve, Aurora falls mysteriously ill, her body freezes, and she seemingly dies in her sleep. As a result the Duke becomes bedridden, overcome with despair.\n\nThe player first takes control of Aurora after she awakens on an altar in the land of Lemuria. She meets and befriends a firefly named Igniculus, who leads her to a sword that she uses to arm herself, and eventually a chamber where the Lady of the Forest is imprisoned. Upon freeing the Lady, Aurora is told of the history of Lemuria. Lemuria was once ruled by the Queen of Light until one night when she mysteriously vanished. From the darkness rose Umbra, Queen of the Night, who sent her daughters to steal Lemuria's light — the sun, the stars, and the moon. The Lady further reveals to Aurora that the two worlds are connected by a mirror that was stolen by Umbra. To be able to use the mirror to go home, Aurora must recover Lemuria's light. The Lady then gives Aurora advice, a flute, and the stars which she had, granting Aurora the ability to fly.\n\nAlong Aurora's quest, she is joined by Rubella, an Aerostati jester with a slight word pronunciation problem, who is searching for her brother Tristis; Finn, a young, rather timid Capilli whose village is beset by a curse cast by Umbra; Norah, Aurora's stepsister, who was pulled through the mirror to Lemuria; Robert, a Populi trader; and Rubella's brother Tristis. She further learns through a series of visions that her father's health is declining and a nearby dam has burst, flooding the area. The people of his kingdom seek his leadership to resolve the crisis, but his combined despair and failing health render him unable to guide them.\n\nThe party eventually locates the mirror back to Aurora's world at the Temple of the Moon. Upon crossing, Aurora is immediately confronted by her stepmother and other stepsister Cordelia. Norah reveals that she led Aurora into a trap; her mother and Aurora's stepmother is in fact Umbra herself, and Norah and Cordelia are Nox and Crepusculum, the daughters Umbra sent to steal Lemuria's sun and moon. Aurora further learns that Umbra's arch-enemy, the Queen of Light, is in fact Aurora's mother. Umbra attempts to kill Aurora, but Aurora's false crown—a gift from her father—shields her from harm. Aurora is thrown into prison and left to die.\n\nWhile imprisoned, Aurora has a vision of her mother, who is revealed to have transported her to Lemuria in order to protect her from Umbra. Upon awakening she is joined by Óengus, a Kategida who was exiled when he pledged himself to Umbra in exchange for his clan's lives. The two free the party, but upon leaving the tower they are confronted by Crepusculum; Aurora defeats her and retrieves the moon, causing her to change from a child into a grown woman. She and her friends head to the Cynbel Sea seeking the sun. They are joined by Genovefa, a young sorceress of the Piscean Village, and one of the last of her kind.\n\nAfter making her way through the Palace of the Sun, Aurora confronts and defeats Nox, regaining the sun. Umbra promptly arrives, enraged at the death of her daughters, but offers Aurora the chance to reunite with her father in exchange for the moon and the stars. Unable to abandon the Lemurians to their fate, Aurora reluctantly tells her father through the portal she cannot return to him, leading to his death. With the Duke dead, the fake crown protecting Aurora disappears, leaving her vulnerable to Umbra's magic. Severely injured from the attacks, Aurora crawls her way to escape with the sun.\n\nIgniculus, with the help of his firefly friends, carries Aurora to the altar where she first woke in Lemuria. Beside the altar is the Lady of the Forest, who reveals herself to be the Queen of Light. She revives Aurora with the aid of all the Lemurians Aurora helped throughout her journey. With Aurora's renewed powers, she quickly flies the party up into the sky to Umbra's castle, and together, they defeat Umbra.\n\nThrough one last vision, Aurora learns that the flood is worsening. With the help of all her Lemurian friends, she goes through the mirror to her world, arriving on Easter Sunday, and rescues the people of the Duke's kingdom from the flood by leading them back through the mirror to Lemuria.\n\nInitially revealed at GDC Europe 2013 by creative director Patrick Plourde, \"Child of Light\" is said to be inspired by Studio Ghibli and Yoshitaka Amano in its art style, and in presentation similar to games like \"Vagrant Story\", \"Final Fantasy VIII\" and \"Limbo\". During development, the writer was Jeffrey Yohalem. The lead programmer was Brie Code. The game is narrated by Canadian actress Caroline Dhavernas.\n\nDuring development, the character of Aurora was going to grow physically throughout the game, ageing from 5 to 10, to 15, and to finish around 20 years old; this plot device was likened to an evolution of the character in how her relationships with others and her perspective on life changed, and would mirror the gameplay's RPG mechanics, starting off weak and leveling up. The game would also have had multiple endings, where \"the player [would] decide what ending they want\". Ultimately, Aurora only ages physically once in the game and there is just one ending. Plourde and Yohalem also discussed the concept of a Prince Charming in the narrative, and how they wanted Aurora to be a strong female character who did not rely on a man or fall in love at the end of the story. Yohalem particularly expressed how love is an \"easy way out\" for a writer. The narrative instead focuses on growing up in the modern world, sacrificing time to help others, becoming an adult, and how one does that by themselves.\n\nA final level based in the sky and set after defeating Nox but before fighting Umbra was originally planned but did not make it into the final version of the game; the level revolved entirely around gameplay and no story was removed.\n\nThough fictional, several aspects of the game are based on reality. Though not explicitly stated in-game, Aurora's duchy in Austria is located in Carniola. An earthquake that hit the capital of Carniola on Easter Sunday in 1895 is adapted into the game's story, where it causes a nearby dam to burst and the capital to be flooded. Similarly, the land of Lemuria that the player explores throughout the game is based on a supposedly lost continent.\n\nThe game was designed using the UbiArt Framework engine, which had previously been used to design \"Rayman Origins\" and \"Rayman Legends\". The engine allowed the design team to input concept art directly into the game, giving the game the look of an animated painting and the feel of progressing in an illustration. The team focused on creating a watercolor effect to give the impression of \"being awake in an underwater dream\". After some of the staff had their children successfully draw Aurora based on the brief description of her being a princess with long red hair and an oversized crown, they knew they had created an iconic character.\n\n\"Child of Light\" takes inspiration from many poems, with Plourde describing it as \"a playable poem\"; the majority of the game's dialogue is portrayed through rhyme delivered in ballad form, in which each four-line stanza sees the second and fourth lines end with rhyming words. Variable iambic syllable counts were used for flexibility, with Yohalem explaining its use to justify varying line lengths and word pairings that don't always perfectly match up. Collectibles in the game called Confessions—secret letters that the player can find floating in the wind and pick up—are delivered in the form of sonnets. Yohalem believes the most difficult challenge he faced while writing for the game was keeping each character's voice distinct from one another despite them sharing the same cadence while rhyming. Yohalem attributes the fairy tale culture of the game to \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\" and also looked to using \"Sleeping Beauty\" as a thematic element.\n\nPlourde states that the art was inspired by illustrators such as Arthur Rackham, John Bauer, and Edmund Dulac, as well as the art of Yoshitaka Amano, with whom they partnered in designing some of the characters and in the production of a \"Child of Light\" painting. The painting was distributed as a European-exclusive poster that came with the deluxe editions of the game on PC, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4.\n\nUbisoft also partnered with Cirque du Soleil during the development of the game, who helped provide the game's theatrical feel and costume design.\n\nThe original soundtrack has 18 tracks and was composed by Béatrice Martin, also known as Cœur de pirate, a Canadian singer and songwriter from the province of Québec. Martin worked with the Montreal-based Bratislava Symphony Orchestra in recording some of the songs. Plourde described her music as \"fresh, romantic and optimistic\", elements he wanted to express with \"Child of Light\".\n\n\"Child of Light\" received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the PlayStation 3 version 89/100, the Switch version 84/100, the Wii U version 84/100, the PlayStation 4 version 82/100, the Xbox One version 82/100, the Xbox 360 version 74/100, and the PC version 77/100.\n\nVince Ingenito of \"IGN\" gave it a 9.3/10, praising the combat system and visual style, although he also said that the rhyming felt forced. Chris Carter of \"Destructoid\" gave it an 8.5/10, calling the combat system \"straightforward, yet fun\" and praised the story. \"GameZone\" Matt Liebl gave the PC version a 9.5/10, stating \"\"Child of Light\" isn't the type of game we're used to from Ubisoft, but it's the type of game this industry needs. It's hard not to look at the game and admire its beauty, but underneath the gorgeous visuals is a thought-provoking story that'll draw you in.\"\n\nOn April 30, 2015, Ubisoft released a free digital book titled \"Child of Light: Reginald the Great\" to celebrate the game's first anniversary. Written by the game's writer Jeffrey Yohalem, the story of the book revolves around Reginald and his adventures in Lemuria two years after \"Child of Light\".\n\nAt the time of the book's release in 2015, illustrator Serge Meirinho stated that he was currently involved in a new book set in the \"Child of Light\" universe, and creative director Patrick Plourde explained that they had two books already written and a third planned, though no further books were released.\n\nAnnounced in October 2018, screenwriter Tasha Huo is writing a pilot for a television adaptation of \"Child of Light\"; in an interview with \"Variety\", Huo stated that she was \"a longtime fan of the game\" and wanted to capture the theme of a strong female heroine in a fairy tale world in a live-action show.\n\nIn 2015, Plourde stated that more projects set in the \"Child of Light\" universe were under development; he had previously said the game was profitable enough to fund a sequel. Ubisoft were reportedly \"super happy\" with the success of \"Child of Light\", and as a result established the developers of the game as a core team at Ubisoft Montreal.\n\nThe announcement of the game's upcoming release on the Nintendo Switch in late 2018 also teased a sequel, titled \"Child of Light II\". Prior to the release of \"Child of Light\", Plourde remarked on how it could be interesting to look at falling in love \"at another time\" and commented on possibly returning to the character of Aurora. In an \"AMA\" (Ask Me Anything) conducted on Reddit following the release of the game, writer Jeffrey Yohalem expressed interest in a sequel, hinting that the contents of the collectible Confessions seen in \"Child of Light\" could play a central role.\n"}

{"id": "371301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=371301", "title": "Electronic voting", "text": "Electronic voting\n\nElectronic voting (also known as e-voting) refers to voting using electronic means to either aid or take care of the chores of casting and counting votes.\n\nDepending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use standalone electronic voting machines (also called EVM) or computers connected to the Internet. It may encompass a range of Internet services, from basic transmission of tabulated results to full-function online voting through common connectable household devices. The degree of automation may be limited to marking a paper ballot, or may be a comprehensive system of vote input, vote recording, data encryption and transmission to servers, and consolidation and tabulation of election results.\n\nA worthy e-voting system must perform most of these tasks while complying with a set of standards established by regulatory bodies, and must also be capable to deal successfully with strong requirements associated with security, accuracy, integrity, swiftness, privacy, auditability, accessibility, cost-effectiveness, scalability and ecological sustainability.\n\nElectronic voting technology can include punched cards, optical scan voting systems and specialized voting kiosks (including self-contained direct-recording electronic voting systems, or DRE). It can also involve transmission of ballots and votes via telephones, private computer networks, or the Internet.\n\nIn general, two main types of e-voting can be identified:\n\nElectronic voting technology intends to speed the counting of ballots, reduce the cost of paying staff to count votes manually and can provide improved accessibility for disabled voters.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that as voting systems become more complex and include software, different methods of election fraud become possible. Others also challenge the use of electronic voting from a theoretical point of view, arguing that humans are not equipped for verifying operations occurring within an electronic machine and that because people cannot verify these operations, the operations cannot be trusted. Furthermore, some computing experts have argued for the broader notion that people cannot trust any programming they did not author.\n\nCritics of electronic voting, including security analyst Bruce Schneier, note that \"computer security experts are unanimous on what to do (some voting experts disagree, but it is the computer security experts who need to be listened to; the problems here are with the computer, not with the fact that the computer is being used in a voting application)... DRE machines must have a voter-verifiable paper audit trails... Software used on DRE machines must be open to public scrutiny\" to ensure the accuracy of the voting system. Verifiable ballots are necessary because computers can and do malfunction, and because voting machines can be compromised.\n\nMany insecurities have been found in commercial voting machines, such as using a default administration password. Cases have also been reported of machines making unpredictable, inconsistent errors. Key issues with electronic voting are therefore the openness of a system to public examination from outside experts, the creation of an authenticatable paper record of votes cast and a chain of custody for records.\n\nThere has been contention, especially in the United States, that electronic voting, especially DRE voting, could facilitate electoral fraud and may not be fully auditable. In addition, electronic voting has been criticised as unnecessary and expensive to introduce. While countries like India continue to use electronic voting, several countries have cancelled e-voting systems or decided against a large-scale rollout, notably the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and the United Kingdom due to issues in reliability of EVMs.\n\nElectronic voting systems for electorates have been in use since the 1960s when punched card systems debuted. Their first widespread use was in the USA where 7 counties switched to this method for the 1964 presidential election. The newer optical scan voting systems allow a computer to count a voter's mark on a ballot. DRE voting machines which collect and tabulate votes in a single machine, are used by all voters in all elections in Brazil and India, and also on a large scale in Venezuela and the United States. They have been used on a large scale in the Netherlands but have been decommissioned after public concerns.\n\nInternet voting systems have gained popularity and have been used for government elections and referendums in Estonia, and Switzerland as well as municipal elections in Canada and party primary elections in the United States and France.\n\nThere are also hybrid systems that include an electronic ballot marking device (usually a touch screen system similar to a DRE) or other assistive technology to print a voter verified paper audit trail, then use a separate machine for electronic tabulation.\n\nSometimes called a \"document ballot voting system\", paper-based voting systems originated as a system where votes are cast and counted by hand, using paper ballots. With the advent of electronic tabulation came systems where paper cards or sheets could be marked by hand, but counted electronically. These systems included punched card voting, marksense and later digital pen voting systems.\n\nThese systems can include a ballot marking device or electronic ballot marker that allows voters to make their selections using an electronic input device, usually a touch screen system similar to a DRE. Systems including a ballot marking device can incorporate different forms of assistive technology. In 2004, Open Voting Consortium demonstrated the 'Dechert Design', a General Public License open source paper ballot printing system with open source bar codes on each ballot.\n\nA direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machine records votes by means of a ballot display provided with mechanical or electro-optical components that can be activated by the voter (typically buttons or a touchscreen); that processes data with computer software; and that records voting data and ballot images in memory components. After the election it produces a tabulation of the voting data stored in a removable memory component and as a printed copy. The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central location. These systems use a precinct count method that tabulates ballots at the polling place. They typically tabulate ballots as they are cast and print the results after the close of polling.\n\nIn 2002, in the United States, the Help America Vote Act mandated that one handicapped accessible voting system be provided per polling place, which most jurisdictions have chosen to satisfy with the use of DRE voting machines, some switching entirely over to DRE. In 2004, 28.9% of the registered voters in the United States used some type of direct recording electronic voting system, up from 7.7% in 1996.\nIn 2004, India adopted Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) for its elections to its parliament with 380 million voters casting their ballots using more than one million voting machines. The Indian EVMs are designed and developed by two government-owned defence equipment manufacturing units, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL). Both systems are identical, and are developed to the specifications of Election Commission of India. The system is a set of two devices running on 7.5 volt batteries. One device, the voting Unit is used by the voter, and another device called the control unit is operated by the electoral officer. Both units are connected by a five-metre cable. The voting unit has a blue button for each candidate. The unit can hold 16 candidates, but up to four units can be chained, to accommodate 64 candidates. The control unit has three buttons on the surface – one button to release a single vote, one button to see the total number of votes cast till now, and one button to close the election process. The result button is hidden and sealed. It cannot be pressed unless the close button has already been pressed. A controversy was raised when the voting machine malfunctioned which was shown in parliament.\n\nA public network DRE voting system is an election system that uses electronic ballots and transmits vote data from the polling place to another location over a public network. Vote data may be transmitted as individual ballots as they are cast, periodically as batches of ballots throughout the election day, or as one batch at the close of voting. This includes Internet voting as well as telephone voting.\n\nPublic network DRE voting system can utilize either precinct count or central count method. The central count method tabulates ballots from multiple precincts at a central location.\n\nInternet voting can use remote locations (voting from any Internet capable computer) or can use traditional polling locations with voting booths consisting of Internet connected voting systems.\n\nCorporations and organizations routinely use Internet voting to elect officers and board members and for other proxy elections. Internet voting systems have been used privately in many modern nations and publicly in the United States, the UK, Switzerland and Estonia. In Switzerland, where it is already an established part of local referendums, voters get their passwords to access the ballot through the postal service. Most voters in Estonia can cast their vote in local and parliamentary elections, if they want to, via the Internet, as most of those on the electoral roll have access to an e-voting system, the largest run by any European Union country. It has been made possible because most Estonians carry a national identity card equipped with a computer-readable microchip and it is these cards which they use to get access to the online ballot. All a voter needs is a computer, an electronic card reader, their ID card and its PIN, and they can vote from anywhere in the world. Estonian e-votes can only be cast during the days of advance voting. On election day itself people have to go to polling stations and fill in a paper ballot.\n\nIn March 2000 the Arizona Democratic Party ran its Presidential Primary over the internet using the private company votation.com. Each registered member of the party received a personal identification number in the mail. These citizens had the option to either cast ballots at a designated location or over the internet from the comfort of their own home. Voters voting over the internet were required to insert their PIN and answer two personal questions. Once all the information is verified, they have the voting options.\n\nBy 2009, Estonia had advanced the farthest in utilizing Internet voting technology. In Estonia, each voter has a national ID card that they use to identify each citizen. The ID card is the security Estonia put in to ensure reliability in votes. Security officials said that they have not detected any unusual activity or tampering of the votes.\n\nA 2017 study of online voting in two Swiss cantons found that it had no effect on turnout.\n\nA paper on “remote electronic voting and turnout in the Estonian 2007 parliamentary elections” showed that rather than eliminating inequalities, e-voting might have enhanced the digital divide between higher and lower socioeconomic classes. People who lived greater distances from polling areas voted at higher levels with this service now available. The 2007 Estonian elections yielded a higher voter turnout from those who lived in higher income regions and who received formal education.\n\nThe use of electronic voting in elections remains a contentious issue. Some countries such as Netherlands and Germany have stopped using it after it was shown to be unreliable, while the Indian Election commission recommends it. The involvement of numerous stakeholders including companies that manufacture these machines as well as political parties that stand to gain from rigging complicates this further.\n\nA 2017 study of Brazil found no systematic difference in vote choices between online and offline electorates.\n\nHowever, it has been also argued that the rigging of EVMs influenced the results of elections in India in 2017 to a large extent.\n\nIt has further been argued political parties that have more support from the less fortunate—who are unfamiliar with the Internet—may suffer in the elections due to e-voting, which tends to increase voting in the upper/middle class. It is unsure as to whether narrowing the digital divide would promote equal voting opportunities for people across various social, economic and ethnic backgrounds. In the long run, this is contingent not only on internet accessibility, which is already widely available in Estonia, but also depends on people’s level of familiarity with the Internet.\n\nThe security of these in person electronic voting machines is almost entirely dependent on the implementation of security protocols at each locality. A group of researchers studying the recent Estonian elections describe massive operational lapses in security from transferring election results on personal thumb drives to posting network credentials on the wall in view of the public. The researchers concluded that these systems are insecure in their current implementation, and due to the rise of nation state interest in influencing elections, should be \"discontinue[d].\" \n\nElectronic voting systems may offer advantages compared to other voting techniques. An electronic voting system can be involved in any one of a number of steps in the setup, distributing, voting, collecting, and counting of ballots, and thus may or may not introduce advantages into any of these steps. Potential disadvantages exist as well including the potential for flaws or weakness in any electronic component.\n\nCharles Stewart of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that 1 million more ballots were counted in the 2004 USA presidential election than in 2000 because electronic voting machines detected votes that paper-based machines would have missed.\n\nIn May 2004 the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report titled \"Electronic Voting Offers Opportunities and Presents Challenges\", analyzing both the benefits and concerns created by electronic voting. A second report was released in September 2005 detailing some of the concerns with electronic voting, and ongoing improvements, titled \"Federal Efforts to Improve Security and Reliability of Electronic Voting Systems Are Under Way, but Key Activities Need to Be Completed\".\n\nElectronic voting systems may use \"electronic ballot\" to store votes in computer memory. Systems which use them exclusively are called DRE voting systems. When electronic ballots are used there is no risk of exhausting the supply of ballots. Additionally, these electronic ballots remove the need for printing of paper ballots, a significant cost. When administering elections in which ballots are offered in multiple languages (in some areas of the United States, public elections are required by the National Voting Rights Act of 1965), electronic ballots can be programmed to provide ballots in multiple languages for a single machine. The advantage with respect to ballots in different languages appears to be unique to electronic voting. For example, King County, Washington's demographics require them under U.S. federal election law to provide ballot access in Chinese. With any type of paper ballot, the county has to decide how many Chinese-language ballots to print, how many to make available at each polling place, etc. Any strategy that can assure that Chinese-language ballots will be available at all polling places is certain, at the very least, to result in a significant number of wasted ballots. (The situation with lever machines would be even worse than with paper: the only apparent way to reliably meet the need would be to set up a Chinese-language lever machine at each polling place, few of which would be used at all.)\n\nCritics argue the need for extra ballots in any language can be mitigated by providing a process to print ballots at voting locations. They argue further, the cost of software validation, compiler trust validation, installation validation, delivery validation and validation of other steps related to electronic voting is complex and expensive, thus electronic ballots are not guaranteed to be less costly than printed ballots.\n\n Electronic voting machines can be made fully accessible for persons with disabilities. Punched card and optical scan machines are not fully accessible for the blind or visually impaired, and lever machines can be difficult for voters with limited mobility and strength. Electronic machines can use headphones, sip and puff, foot pedals, joy sticks and other adaptive technology to provide the necessary accessibility.\n\nOrganizations such as the Verified Voting Foundation have criticized the accessibility of electronic voting machines and advocate alternatives. Some disabled voters (including the visually impaired) could use a tactile ballot, a ballot system using physical markers to indicate where a mark should be made, to vote a secret paper ballot. These ballots can be designed identically to those used by other voters. However, other disabled voters (including voters with dexterity disabilities) could be unable to use these ballots.\n\nThe concept of election verifiability through cryptographic solutions has emerged in the academic literature to introduce transparency and trust in electronic voting systems. It allows voters and election observers to verify that votes have been recorded, tallied and declared correctly, in a manner independent from the hardware and software running the election. Three aspects of verifiability are considered: individual, universal, and eligibility. Individual verifiability allows a voter to check that her own vote is included in the election outcome, universal verifiability allows voters or election observers to check that the election outcome corresponds to the votes cast, and eligibility verifiability allows voters and observers to check that each vote in the election outcome was cast by a uniquely registered voter.\n\nElectronic voting machines are able to provide immediate feedback to the voter detecting such possible problems as undervoting and overvoting which may result in a spoiled ballot. This immediate feedback can be helpful in successfully determining voter intent.\n\nIt has been alleged by groups such as the UK-based Open Rights Group that a lack of testing, inadequate audit procedures, and insufficient attention given to system or process design with electronic voting leaves \"elections open to error and fraud\".\n\nIn 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany found that when using voting machines the \"verification of the result must be possible by the citizen reliably and without any specialist knowledge of the subject.\" The DRE Nedap-computers used till then did not fulfill that requirement. The decision did not ban electronic voting as such, but requires all essential steps in elections to be subject to public examinability.\n\nIn 2013, The California Association of Voting Officials was formed to maintain efforts toward publicly owned General Public License open source voting systems\n\nIn 2013, researchers from Europe proposed that the electronic voting systems should be coercion evident. There should be a public evidence of the amount of coercion that took place in a particular elections. An internet voting system called \"Caveat Coercitor\" shows how coercion evidence in voting systems can be achieved.\n\nA fundamental challenge with any voting machine is produce evidence that the votes were recorded as cast and tabulated as recorded. Election results produced by voting systems that rely on voter-marked paper ballots can be verified with manual hand counts (either valid sampling or full recounts). Non-document ballot voting systems must support auditability in different ways. An independently auditable system, sometimes called an Independent Verification, can be used in recounts or audits. These systems can include the ability for voters to verify how their votes were cast or enable officials to verify that votes were tabulated correctly.\n\nA discussion draft argued by researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) states, \"Simply put, the DRE architecture’s inability to provide for independent audits of its electronic records makes it a poor choice for an environment in which detecting errors and fraud is important.\" The report does not represent the official position of NIST, and misinterpretations of the report has led NIST to explain that \"Some statements in the report have been misinterpreted. The draft report includes statements from election officials, voting system vendors, computer scientists and other experts in the field about what is potentially possible in terms of attacks on DREs. However, these statements are not report conclusions.\"\n\nVarious technologies can be used to assure DRE voters that their votes were cast correctly, and allow officials to detect possible fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the tabulated results. Some systems include technologies such as cryptography (visual or mathematical), paper (kept by the voter or verified and left with election officials), audio verification, and dual recording or witness systems (other than with paper).\n\nDr. Rebecca Mercuri, the creator of the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) concept (as described in her Ph.D. dissertation in October 2000 on the basic voter verifiable ballot system), proposes to answer the auditability question by having the voting machine print a paper ballot or other paper facsimile that can be visually verified by the voter before being entered into a secure location. Subsequently, this is sometimes referred to as the \"Mercuri method.\" To be truly \"voter\"-verified, the record itself must be verified by the voter and able to be done without assistance, such as visually or audibly. If the voter must use a bar-code scanner or other electronic device to verify, then the record is not truly voter-verifiable, since it is actually the electronic device that is verifying the record for the voter. VVPAT is the form of Independent Verification most commonly found in elections in the United States and other countries such as Venezuela.\n\nEnd-to-end auditable voting systems can provide the voter with a receipt that can be taken home. This receipt does not allow voters to prove to others how they voted, but it does allow them to verify that the system detected their vote correctly. End-to-end (E2E) systems include Punchscan, ThreeBallot and Prêt à Voter. Scantegrity is an add-on that extends current optical scan voting systems with an E2E layer. The city of Takoma Park, Maryland used Scantegrity II for its November, 2009 election.\n\nSystems that allow the voter to prove how they voted are never used in U.S. public elections, and are outlawed by most state constitutions. The primary concerns with this solution are voter intimidation and vote selling.\n\nAn audit system can be used in measured random recounts to detect possible malfunction or fraud. With the VVPAT method, the paper ballot is often treated as the official ballot of record. In this scenario, the ballot is primary and the electronic records are used only for an initial count. In any subsequent recounts or challenges, the paper, not the electronic ballot, would be used for tabulation. Whenever a paper record serves as the legal ballot, that system will be subject to the same benefits and concerns as any paper ballot system.\n\nTo successfully audit any voting machine, a strict chain of custody is required.\n\nThe solution was first demonstrated (New York City, March 2001) and used (Sacramento, California 2002) by AVANTE International Technology, Inc.. In 2004 Nevada was the first state to successfully implement a DRE voting system that printed an electronic record. The $9.3 million voting system provided by Sequoia Voting Systems included more than 2,600 AVC EDGE touchscreen DREs equipped with the VeriVote VVPAT component.\n\nInadequately secured hardware can be subject to physical tampering. Some critics, such as the group \"Wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet\" (\"We do not trust voting machines\"), charge that, for instance, foreign hardware could be inserted into the machine, or between the user and the central mechanism of the machine itself, using a man in the middle attack technique, and thus even sealing DRE machines may not be sufficient protection. This claim is countered by the position that review and testing procedures can detect fraudulent code or hardware, if such things are present, and that a thorough, verifiable chain of custody would prevent the insertion of such hardware or software. Security seals are commonly employed in an attempt to detect tampering, but testing by Argonne National Laboratory and others demonstrates that existing seals can usually be quickly defeated by a trained person using low-tech methods.\n\nSecurity experts, such as Bruce Schneier, have demanded that voting machine source code should be publicly available for inspection. Others have also suggested publishing voting machine software under a free software license as is done in Australia. Software such as Sammaty come under GNU GPL, which means their source code is publicly available and hence transparent.\n\nOne method to any error with voting machines is parallel testing, which are conducted on the Election Day with randomly picked machines. The ACM published a study showing that, to change the outcome of the 2000 U.S. Presidential election, only 2 votes in each precinct would have needed to be changed.\n\nCriticisms can be mitigated by review and testing procedures to detect fraudulent code or hardware, if such things are present, and through a verifiable chain of custody to prevent the insertion of such hardware or software.\n\nCritics also mention the increasing number of attack programs that online voting systems are greatly susceptible to. Malicious payloads- software data intended to do damage- have become so advanced that they can easily change a voter’s vote without any knowledge to other parties, regardless of voter identification or encryption software.\n\nBenefits can include reduced tabulation times and an increase of participation (voter turnout), particularly through the use of Internet voting.\n\nThose in opposition suggest alternate vote counting systems, citing Switzerland (as well as many other countries), which uses paper ballots exclusively, suggesting that electronic voting is not the only means to get a rapid count of votes. A country of a little over 7 million people, Switzerland publishes a definitive ballot count in about six hours. In villages, the ballots are even counted manually.\n\nCritics also note that it becomes difficult or impossible to verify the identity of a voter remotely, and that the introduction of public networks become more vulnerable and complex.\n\nWhether the total cost of ownership with electronic voting is lower than other systems is not yet clear.\n\nPolling place electronic voting or Internet voting examples have taken place in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Estonia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Namibia, the Netherlands (Rijnland Internet Election System), Norway, Peru, Switzerland, the UK, Venezuela, and the Philippines.\n\nIn 1996, after tests conducted on more than 50 municipalities, the Brazilian Electoral Justice has launched their \"voting machine\". Since 2000, all Brazilian voters are able to use the electronic ballot boxes to choose their candidates. In 2010 presidential election which had more than 135 million voters, the result was defined 75 minutes after the end of voting. The electronic ballot box is made up of two micro-terminals (one located in the voting cabin and the other with the voting board representative) which are connected by a 5-meter cable. Externally, the micro-terminals have only a numerical keyboard, which does not accept any command executed by the simultaneous pressure of more than one key. In case of power failure, the internal battery provides the energy or it can be connected to an automotive battery. The Brazilian electronic ballot box serves today as a model for other countries.\n\nEach Estonian citizen possesses an electronic chip-enabled ID card, which allows him/her to vote over the internet. The ID card is inserted into a card reader, which is connected to a computer. Once his/her identity is verified (using the electronic ID card as a sort of digital signature), he/she can then cast his/her vote via the internet. Votes are not considered final until the end of election day, so Estonian citizens can go back and re-cast their votes until election day is officially over. Popularity of online voting in Estonia has increased widely throughout the nation, as in the elections of 2014 and 2015, nearly one third of Estonian votes were cast online.\n\nElectronic Voting Machines (\"EVM\") are being used in Indian General and State Elections to implement electronic voting in part from 1999 elections and recently in 2017 state elections held in five states across India. EVMs have replaced paper ballots in local, state and general (parliamentary) elections in India. There were earlier claims regarding EVMs' tamparability and security which have not been proved.After rulings of Delhi High Court, Supreme Court and demands from various political parties,Election Commission decided to introduce EVMs with voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) system. The VVPAT system was introduced in 8 of 543 parliamentary constituencies as a pilot project in Indian general election, 2014.\n\nElectronic voting had been used in 2018 People's Justice Party leadership election, which is the party election for the country's largest party. It had suffer many technical problems and many polls had been postponed due to the poor system.\n\n1964\n\nThe Norden-Coleman optical scan voting system, the first such system to see actual use, was adopted for use in Orange County, California.\n\n1974\n\nThe Video Voter, the first DRE voting machine used in a government election, developed by the Frank Thornber Company in Chicago, Illinois, saw its first trial use in 1974 near Chicago.\n\nThe U.S. Government is given a report by Roy Saltman, a consultant in developing election technology and policies, in which the certification of voting machines is analyzed for the first time.\n\nAug 28, 1986\n\nThe Uniformed and Overseas Citizen Absentee Voting Act of 1986 (UOCAVA) requires that US states allow certain groups of citizens to register and vote absentee in elections for federal offices.\n\n1990\n\nThe FEC (Federal Election Commission) released a universalized standard for computerized voting.\n\n1996\n\nThe Reform Party uses I-Voting (Internet Voting) to select their presidential candidate. This election is the first governmental election to use this method in the U.S. \nMay 2002\n\nThe FEC revised the standards established for electronic voting from 1990.\n\nNov 2004\n\n4,438 of votes in the general election is lost by North Carolina’s electronic voting machines. The machines continued to count electronic votes past the device's memory capacity and the votes were irretrievably lost.\n\nDec 2005\n\nBlack Box Voting showed how easy it is to hack an electronic voting system. Computer experts in Leon County, Fl lead a simulation where they changed the outcome of a mock election by tampering with the tabulator without leaving evidence of their actions.\n\nSep 13, 2006\n\nIt was demonstrated that Diebold Electronic Voting Machine can be hacked in less than a minute. Princeton's Professor of Computer Science, Edward Felten who installed a malware which could steal votes and replace them with fraudulent numbers without physically coming in contact with the voting machine or its memory card. The malware can also program a virus that can spread from machine to machine.\n\nSep 21, 2006\n\nThe governor of Maryland, Bob Ehrlich (R), advised against casting electronic votes as an alternative method for casting paper absentee ballots. This was a complete turn around since Maryland became one of the first states to accept electronic voting systems statewide during his term.\n\nSep 3, 2009\n\nDiebold, responsible for much of the technology in the election-systems business, sells their hold to Election Systems & Software, Inc for $5 Million, less than 1/5 of its price seven years earlier.\nOct 28, 2009\n\nThe federal Military and Overseas Voters Empowerment Act (MOVE) requires US states to provide ballots to UOCAVA voters in at least one electronic format (email, fax, or an online delivery system).\n\nJan 3, 2013\n\nVoter Empowerment Act of 2013 – This act requires each US state to make available public websites for online voter registration.\n\nTexas law has allowed American astronauts who cannot vote in person and are unable to vote via absentee ballot, such as those aboard the International Space Station and Mir space station, to cast their ballots in federal elections electronically from orbit since 1997. Ballots are sent via secure email to the Johnson Spaceflight Center and then passed on to the astronauts' home counties in Texas.\n\nIn December 2005 the US Election Assistance Commission unanimously adopted the 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, which significantly increase security requirements for voting systems and expand access, including opportunities to vote privately and independently, for individuals with disabilities. The guidelines took effect in December 2007 replacing the 2002 Voting System Standards (VSS) developed by the Federal Election Commission.\n\nSome groups such as the Open Voting Consortium believe that to restore voter confidence and to reduce the potential for fraud, all electronic voting systems must be completely available to public scrutiny.\n\nAlso proposed is the requirement for use of open public standards and specifications such as the Election Markup Language (EML) standard developed by OASIS and now under consideration by ISO (see documents and schemas). These can provide consistent processes and mechanisms for managing and performing elections using computer systems.\n\nIn the summer of 2004, the Legislative Affairs Committee of the Association of Information Technology Professionals issued a nine-point proposal for national standards for electronic voting. In an accompanying article, the committee's chair, Charles Oriez, described some of the problems that had arisen around the country.\n\nLegislation has been introduced in the United States Congress regarding electronic voting, including the Nelson-Whitehouse bill. This bill would appropriate as much as 1 billion dollars to fund states' replacement of touch screen systems with optical scan voting system. The legislation also addresses requiring audits of 3% of precincts in all federal elections. It also mandates some form of paper trail audits for all electronic voting machines by the year 2012 on any type of voting technology.\n\nAnother bill, HR.811 (The Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act of 2003), proposed by Representative Rush D. Holt, Jr., a Democrat from New Jersey, would act as an amendment to the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and require electronic voting machines to produce a paper audit trail for every vote. The U.S. Senate companion bill version introduced by Senator Bill Nelson from Florida on November 1, 2007, necessitates the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to continue researching and to provide methods of paper ballot voting for those with disabilities, those who do not primarily speak English, and those who do not have a high literacy rating. Also, it requires states to provide the federal office with audit reports from the hand counting of the voter verified paper ballots. Currently, this bill has been turned over to the United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and a vote date has not been set.\n\nDuring 2008, Congressman Holt, because of an increasing concern regarding the insecurities surrounding the use of electronic voting technology, submitted additional bills to Congress regarding the future of electronic voting. One, called the \"Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections Act of 2008\" (HR5036), states that the General Services Administration will reimburse states for the extra costs of providing paper ballots to citizens, and the costs needed to hire people to count them. This bill was introduced to the House on January 17, 2008. This bill estimates that $500 million will be given to cover costs of the reconversion to paper ballots; $100 million given to pay the voting auditors; and $30 million given to pay the hand counters. This bill provides the public with the choice to vote manually if they do not trust the electronic voting machines. A voting date has not yet been determined.\n\nThe Secure America's Future Elections Act or the SAFE Act (HR 1562) was among the relevant legislation introduced in the 115th Congress. The bill's provisions include designation of the infrastructure used to administer elections as critical infrastructure; funding for states to upgrade the security of the information technology and cybersecurity elements of election-related IT systems; and requirements for durable, readable paper ballots and manual audits of results of elections.\n\nThanks to the Internet, voters can cast their ballots over the electronic voting systems conveniently and efficiently without going to the polling stations. E-voting is a new technology has been implemented by developed countries; most of the research has embraced this technology within this context. Therefore, there is a necessity to explore the implementation and adoption of this technology in developing countries such as South Africa. Although the e-voting system has not yet been implemented in South Africa, researchers such as myself are attempted to study e-voting deployment opportunities in South Africa.\n\nIn the Report on e-voting, in the seminar that was held in Cape Town South Africa, date 12 and 12th March 2013 South Africa’s former President Kgalema Motlanthe, challenged the country’s IEC (Independent Electoral Commission) to explore the possibility of e-voting due to the aftermath of the 2009 national and provincial elections, where the country saw an increase in the number of voting stations from 14 650 in 1999 to 19 726, hence South Africa is now looking to move into electronic voting systems since there is also evidence that e-voting reduces the costs of elections – paper printing and workforce costs – as these have been developed and are developing for decades with the aim of allowing an easier participation of the citizens in the decision-making process, but without the physical and human resources needed in a traditional voting.\n\nCountries like Mexico, Turkey and Nigeria who did surveys on the voters’ perception of security and other trust factors got an overall result that automated elections mean that people can trust the results because it allows for a process that is auditable, transparent and secure, since it helps reduce human error. Where for other largely populated countries like Brazil, India and the Philippines, electronic voting and electronic counting means that people can get official election results within hours, instead of weeks.\n\nAlomari and Figueroa In a nut shell, the main feature of democracy is the right or chance to vote, express an opinion, and/or participate in a decision – voting which gives freedom to choose the best leader for the country, said (Osho et al., 2015). This alone gives opportunity to the people to choose a leader and express their point of view. This proposal is to ensure that this expectation is met with the deployment of e-voting system.\n\nNot only is e-voting great with the turn-around-time on producing results but it also provides a greater auditable auditing process of the election results where necessary. As stated by Sedky & Hamed that sometimes electronic have and will produce errors in the election's result due to problems with hardware and/or software, or procedures. Auditing has such benefits in revealing when recounts are necessary to verify election outcomes, finding errors whether accidental or intentional, deterring fraud and promoting public confidence in elections.\n\n\nProfessor Osho did a research which intended to address the concerns about data security, verifiability and certification and cost; the basic factors to be considered when deploying e-Voting. He created a conceptual framework which combined 3 theories to build 1 conceptual framework through the 5 constructs – in assisting to arrive to the aiming of this research. Thus, the research papers identified that there is a need to understand the security and cost concerns.\n\nThe 3 theoretical frameworks being used in this research paper to create 1 conceptual framework will help complete this study. Namely they are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn May 2007, California Secretary of State Debra Bowen commissioned a \"top-to-bottom review\" of all electronic voting systems in the state. She engaged computer security experts led by the University of California to perform security evaluations of voting system source code as well as \"red teams\" running \"worst case\" Election Day scenarios attempting to identify vulnerabilities to tampering or error. The Top to Bottom review also included a comprehensive review of manufacturer documentation as well as a review of accessibility features and alternative language requirements.\n\nThe end results of the tests were released in the four detailed Secretary of State August 3, 2007, resolutions (for Diebold Election Systems, Hart InterCivic, Sequoia Voting Systems and Elections Systems and Software, Inc.) and updated October 25, 2007 revised resolutions for Diebold and Sequoia voting systems. The security experts found significant security flaws in all of the manufacturers' voting systems, flaws that could allow a single non-expert to compromise an entire election.\n\nOn August 3, 2007, Bowen decertified machines that were tested in her top-to-bottom view including the ES&S InkaVote machine, which was not included in the review because the company submitted it past the deadline for testing. The report issued July 27, 2007, was conducted by the expert \"red team\" attempting to detect the levels of technological vulnerability. Another report on August 2, 2007 was conducted by a source code review team to detect flaws in voting system source code. Both reports found that three of the tested systems fell far short of the minimum requirements specified in the 2005 Voluntary Voting System Guidelines (VVSG). Some of the systems tested were conditionally recertified with new stringent security requirements imposed. The companies in question have until the February 2008 California Presidential Primaries to fix their security issues and ensure that election results can be closely audited.\n\nThe Premier Election Solutions (formerly Diebold Election Systems) AccuVote-TSx voting system was studied by a group of Princeton University computer scientists in 2006. Their results showed that the AccuVote-TSx was insecure and could be \"installed with vote-stealing software in under a minute.\" The scientists also said that machines can transmit computer viruses from one to another \"during normal pre- and post-election activity.\"\n\nPunched cards received considerable notoriety in 2000 when their uneven use in Votomatic style systems in Florida was alleged to have affected the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Invented by Joseph P. Harris, Votomatic was manufactured for a time under license by IBM. William Rouverol, who built the prototype and wrote patents, stated that after the patents expired in 1982, lower quality machines had appeared on the market. The machines used in Florida had five times as many errors as a true Votomatic, he said.\n\nPunched-card-based voting systems, the Votomatic system in particular, use special cards where each possible hole is pre-scored, allowing perforations to be made by the voter pressing a stylus through a guide in the voting machine. A problem with this system is the incomplete punch; this can lead to a smaller hole than expected, or to a mere slit in the card, or to a mere dimple in the card, or to a \"hanging chad\". This technical problem was claimed by the Democratic Party to have influenced the 2000 U.S. presidential election in the state of Florida; critics claimed that punched card voting machines were primarily used in Democratic areas and that hundreds of ballots were not read properly or were disqualified due to incomplete punches, which allegedly tipped the vote in favor of George W. Bush over Al Gore.\n\nIn the 2006 film \"Man of the Year\" starring Robin Williams, the character played by Williams—a comedic host of political talk show—wins the election for President of the United States when a software error in the electronic voting machines produced by the fictional manufacturer Delacroy causes votes to be tallied inaccurately.\n\nIn \"Runoff\", a 2007 novel by Mark Coggins, a surprising showing by the Green Party candidate in a San Francisco Mayoral election forces a runoff between him and the highly favored establishment candidate—a plot line that closely parallels the actual results of the 2003 election. When the private-eye protagonist of the book investigates at the behest of a powerful Chinatown businesswoman, he determines that the outcome was rigged by someone who defeated the security on the city's newly installed e-voting system.\n\n\"Hacking Democracy\" is a 2006 documentary film shown on HBO. Filmed over three years, it documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems that occurred during America's 2000 and 2004 elections, especially in Volusia County, Florida. The film investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems and culminates in the hacking of a Diebold election system in Leon County, Florida.\n\nThe central conflict in the MMO video game Infantry resulted from the global institution of direct democracy through the use of personal voting devices sometime in the 22nd century AD. The practice gave rise to a 'voting class' of citizens composed mostly of homemakers and retirees who tended to be at home all day. Because they had the most free time to participate in voting, their opinions ultimately came to dominate politics.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37304836", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37304836", "title": "Estate satire", "text": "Estate satire\n\nEstate satire is a genre of writing from 14th Century, Medieval literary works. The three Medieval estates were the Clergy (those who prayed), the Nobility (those who fought) and lastly the Peasantry (those who labored). These estates were the major social classes of the time and were typically gender specific to men, although the clergy also included nuns. Nevertheless, women were considered as a separate class in themselves, the best-known example being Geoffrey Chaucer's Wife of Bath. Estates satire praised the glories and purity of each class in its ideal form, but was also used as a window to show how society had gotten out of hand. The \"Norton Anthology of English Literature\" describes the duty of estates satire: \"They set forth the functions and duties of each estate and castigate the failure of the estates in the present world to live up to their divinely assigned social roles\".\n\nThe First Estate, the Church, consisted of those who ran the Catholic church and part of the country. They were the recipients of the \"tithe\" or the 10% tax given to the Church.\n\nThe Second Estate, the Nobility, were royalty, not including the King. They were never taxed but could collect taxes from the Third Estate, and had other special privileges.\n\nThe Third Estate, the Commons, is the largest, consisting of around 96% of the population (UCL). The commons included everyone who did not belong to the first two estates, primarily rural peasants and the urban bourgeois or middle class. They had none of the privileges or luxuries that the first two estates enjoyed, although the rise of capitalism in the late 14th Century resulted in the bourgeois having relatively more power.\n\nAmong 14th-century English authors, John Gower, William Langland, and Chaucer were three of the most prominent writers of the time to include estates satire in their works. Although Gower was more aggressive in his approach, Chaucer was more subtle and more successful, making himself to be the fool of the joke and subverting may of the conventions of the genre. Several Medieval authors used estates satire to express their disgust towards the hypocrisy of the three estates and their supposed virtuous ways.\n\n"}

While conventionally being reduced to its aspect of empowerment of women, the concept stresses the distinction between biological sex and gender as a role, also referring to other marginalized genders in a particular political or social context.\n\nGender empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in regard to development and economics. Entire nations, businesses, communities, and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.

The Human Development and Capabilities Approach, The Millennium Development Goals, and other credible approaches/goals point to empowerment and participation as a necessary step if a country is to overcome the obstacles associated with poverty and development.\n\nGender empowerment can be measured through the Gender Empowerment Measure, or the GEM. The GEM shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. Gem is calculated by tracking \"the share of seats in parliament held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the gender disparity in earned income, reflecting economic independence.\" It then ranks countries given this information.

{"id": "103973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=103973", "title": "General American", "text": "General American\n\nGeneral American (abbreviated as GA or GenAm) is the umbrella variety of American English—the continuum of accents—spoken by a majority of Americans and popularly perceived, among Americans, as lacking any distinctly regional, ethnic, or socioeconomic characteristics. Americans with high education, or from the North Midland, Western New England, and Western regions of the country, are the most likely to be perceived as having \"General American\" accents. The precise definition and usefulness of the term continues to be debated, and the scholars who use it today admittedly do so as a convenient basis for comparison rather than for exactness. Some scholars, despite controversy, prefer the term Standard American English.\n\nStandard Canadian English is sometimes considered to fall under the phonological spectrum of General American, especially rather than the United Kingdom's Received Pronunciation; in fact, spoken Canadian English aligns with General American in nearly every situation where British and American English differ.\n\nThe term \"General American\" was first disseminated by American English scholar George Philip Krapp, who, in 1925, described it as an American type of speech that was \"Western\" but \"not local in character\". In 1930, American linguist John Samuel Kenyon, who largely popularized the term, considered it equivalent to the speech of \"the North\" or \"Northern American\", but, in 1934, \"Western and Midwestern\". Now typically regarded as falling under the General American umbrella are the regional accents of the West, Western New England, and the North Midland (a band spanning central Ohio, central Indiana, central Illinois, northern Missouri, southern Iowa, and southeastern Nebraska), plus the accents of highly educated Americans nationwide. Arguably, all Canadian English accents west of Quebec are also General American, though developing Canadian features, including vowel raising, may serve to increasingly distinguish such accents from American ones. Similarly, William Labov et al.'s 2006 \"Atlas of North American English\" identified these three accent regions—the Western U.S., Midland U.S., and Canada—as sharing those pronunciation features whose convergence would form a hypothetical \"General American\" accent.\n\nRegarded as having General American accents in the earlier 20th century, but not by the middle of the 20th century, are the Mid-Atlantic United States, the Inland Northern United States, and Western Pennsylvania. Accents that have never been included, even since the term's popularization in the 1930s, are the regional accents (especially the \"r\"-dropping ones) of Eastern New England, New York City, and the American South. In 1982, British phonetician John C. Wells wrote that two-thirds of the American population spoke with a General American accent.\n\nEnglish-language scholar William A. Kretzchmar, Jr. explains in a 2004 article that the term \"General American\" came to refer to \"a presumed most common or 'default' form of American English, especially to be distinguished from marked regional speech of New England or the South\" and especially to speech associated with the vaguely-defined \"Midwest\", despite any historical or present evidence supporting this notion. In fact, he argues, a General American accent is merely any in which American speakers have suppressed regional and social features that have become widely noticed and stigmatized.\n\nSince calling one variety of American speech the \"general\" variety can imply privileging and prejudice, Kretzchmar instead promotes the term \"Standard American English\", which he defines as a level of American English pronunciation \"employed by educated speakers in formal settings\", while still being variable within the U.S. from place to place, and even from speaker to speaker. However, the term \"standard\" may also be interpreted as problematically implying a superior or \"best\" form of speech. The term \"Standard North American English\", in an effort to incorporate Canadian speakers under the accent continuum, was also first suggested by Charles Boberg in 2004.\n\nModern language scholars discredit the original notion of General American as a single unified accent, or a standardized form of English—except perhaps as used by television networks and other mass media. Today, the term is understood to refer to a continuum of American speech, with some slight internal variation, but otherwise characterized by the absence of \"marked\" pronunciation features: those perceived by Americans as strongly indicative of a fellow American speaker's regional origin, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Despite confusion arising from the evolving definition and vagueness of the term \"General American\" and its consequent rejection by some linguists, the term persists mainly as a reference point to compare a baseline \"typical\" American English accent with other Englishes around the world (for instance, see: Comparison of General American and Received Pronunciation).\n\nThough General American accents are not commonly perceived as associated with any region, their sound system does have traceable regional origins: specifically, the English of the non-coastal Northeastern United States in the very early twentieth century. This includes western New England and the area to its immediate west, settled by members of the same dialect community: interior Pennsylvania, upstate New York, and the adjacent \"Midwest\" or Great Lakes region. However, since the early to middle twentieth century, deviance away from General American sounds started occurring, and may be ongoing, in the eastern Great Lakes region due to its Northern Cities Vowel Shift (NCVS) towards a unique Inland Northern accent (often now associated with the region's urban centers, like Chicago and Detroit) and in the western Great Lakes region towards a unique North Central accent (often associated with Minnesota, Wisconsin, and North Dakota).\n\nLinguists have proposed multiple factors contributing to the popularity of a rhotic \"General American\" class of accents throughout the United States. Most factors focus on the first half of the twentieth century, though a basic General American pronunciation system may have existed even before the twentieth century, since most American English dialects have diverged very little from each other anyway, when compared to dialects of single languages in other countries where there has been more time for language change (such as the English dialects of England or German dialects of Germany). \n\nOne factor fueling General American's popularity was the major demographic change of twentieth-century American society: increased suburbanization, leading to less mingling of different social classes and less density and diversity of linguistic interactions. As a result, wealthier and higher-educated Americans' communications became more restricted to their own demographic. This, alongside their new marketplace that transcended regional boundaries (arising from the century's faster transportation methods), reinforced a widespread belief that highly-educated Americans should not possess a regional accent. A General American sound, then, originated from both suburbanization and suppression of regional accent by highly-educated Americans in formal settings. A second factor was a rise in immigration to the Great Lakes area (one native region of supposed \"General American\" speech) following the region's rapid industrialization period after the American Civil War, when this region's speakers went on to form a successful and highly mobile business elite, who travelled around the country in the mid-twentieth century, spreading the high status of their accents. A third factor is that various sociological (often race- and class-based) forces repelled socially-conscious Americans away from accents negatively associated with certain minority groups, such as African Americans and poor white communities in the South and with Southern and Eastern European immigrant groups (for example, Jewish communities) in the coastal Northeast. Instead, socially-conscious Americans settled upon accents more prestigiously associated with White Anglo-Saxon Protestant communities in the remainder of the country: namely, the West, the Midwest, and the non-coastal Northeast.\n\nInfluential to codifying General American pronunciation standards in writing was John Samuel Kenyon, author of \"American Pronunciation\" (1924) and pronunciation editor for the second edition of \"Webster's New International Dictionary\" (1934), who used as a basis his native Midwestern (specifically, northern Ohio) pronunciation. Kenyon's home state of Ohio, far from being an area of \"non-regional\" accents, has emerged now as a crossroads for at least four distinct regional accents, according to late twentieth-century research. Furthermore, Kenyon himself was vocally opposed to the notion of any supreme standard of American speech.\n\nGeneral American, like the British Received Pronunciation (RP) and prestige accents of many other societies, has never been the accent of the entire nation, and, unlike RP, does not constitute a homogeneous national standard. Starting in the 1930s, nationwide radio networks adopted non-coastal Northern U.S. rhotic pronunciations for their \"General American\" standard. The entertainment industry similarly shifted from a non-rhotic standard to a rhotic one in the late 1940s, after the triumph of the Second World War, with the patriotic incentive for a more wide-ranging and unpretentious \"heartland variety\" in television and radio.\n\nGeneral American is thus often associated with the speech of North American radio and television announcers, promoted as prestigious in their industry, where it is sometimes called a \"newscaster accent\", \"television English\", or \"Network Standard\". Instructional classes in the United States that promise \"accent reduction\", \"accent modification\", or \"accent neutralization\" usually attempt to teach General American patterns. A common experience among many American celebrities is having worked hard to lose their native regional accents in favor of a more mainstream General American sound, including television journalist Linda Ellerbee, who stated that \"in television you are not supposed to sound like you're \"from\" anywhere\", as well as political comedian Stephen Colbert, both of whom reduced their Southern accents (Colbert completely so), because of the common portrayal of Southerners as stupid and uneducated on American television.\n\nA table containing the consonant phonemes is given below:\n\n\n\nThe 2006 \"Atlas of North American English\" surmises that \"if one were to recognize a type of North American English to be\ncalled 'General American'\" according to data measurements of vowel pronunciations, \"it would be the configuration formed by these three\" dialect regions: Canada, the American West, and the American Midland. The following charts (as well as the one above) present the vowels that these three dialects encompass as a perceived General American sound system.\n\n\n\n\n"}

While pieces had been found at the site earlier, including the King of La Chole stele and Mesoamerican ball court rings, formal excavations were only recently begun. The site had been occupied for over 3,000 years and by three cultures, with contact with other Mesoamerican cultures such as the Teotihuacan and Olmec. Explored areas include what may be the largest Mesoamerican ball court, a one-hectare pyramidal base and a hill with petroglyphs and a probably sacrifice stone.\n\nAccording to residents, pieces had been found in the area since the 1930s, including some of the most important but formal excavations were begun only in the very late 2000s, when authorities began to acquire lands. One of these pieces is a stele discovered in 1944 called the King of La Chole, who was a figure that venerated. Today, this piece is at the local church. The feet of the stele was in a private home but were returned to the site for its new museum. The rings of the ball court were taken to the city of Petatlán, along with a circular stone representing the goddess of the Earth, Tlaltecutli. But have now been returned to the museum at the site. But the stele will remain at the church.\n\nThe site is located in the municipality of Petatlán, in the small village of La Soledad de Maciel. This village is located four km south of Highway 200 at the end of a dirt road. The village has a population of about 400 inhabitants with just under eighty houses. The residents subsist on agriculture, growing corn, beans, vegetables and coconuts, supplemented by some cattle and fishing along the local shore. The area is also known for the cultivation of tobacco and the making of handcrafted cigars. The excavation of the site and construction of a museum was built from 2007 to 2010 at a cost of 12 million pesos, not only to study and preserve the site but also to provide tourist attraction to an area with limited economic possibilities. According to the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia the ruins could be as important as Teotihuacan or Chichén Itza as they span from the pre Classic to post Classic periods in Mesoamerican chronology. It is the largest ceremonial center and largest archeological site in the state. The site coincides with the ancient city of Cihuatlán, which flourished between 200 and 800 C.E. It was the largest population center between Acapulco and Zacatula at its height. Pieces of ornamental work in made with shells and copper indicate that this was begun here earlier than in Michoacán .\n\nThe excavated site is likely a ceremonial center which was used by various cultures including the Tomiles, the Cuitatecos and the Tepoztecas during its history. There are surrounding settlements, so the site could extend as much as ten km2, from the Huamilule Hill to the community of Cabritero and the Chiquito River. According to the finds, the site had been occupied for more than 3,000 years and had contact with a number of other Mesoamerican cultures. Find of ceramics and other objects at this site and other nearby sites indicate that the cultures had economic and cultural contact with Teotihuacan. The site contains one idol which measures 1.5 meters tall and appears to be from the Olmec period. \n\nExplored areas include Mound A, Mound B and the Cerro de los Brujos. Mound A was the ball court. This court measures 160 meters long and 29 meters wide. There is yet another section to be excavated, which may make it the largest Mesoamerican ball court. Excavation of the court found various deposits of human sacrifice and ceramics in the shape of jaguars. It also included a glyph, which is believed to relate to the original name of the city. Mound B measures one hectare and is 15 meters high. It was topped with five temples surrounding a sunken patio. The Cerro de los Brujos has various petroglyphs, a circular stone with appears to have been used for sacrifices and four pyramidal bases. One unique aspect to the site is that its pyramids are constructed with river stone and adobe, not common in Mexican archeology.\n"}

{"id": "20354", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20354", "title": "Month", "text": "Month\n\nA month is a unit of time, used with calendars, which is approximately as long as a natural period related to the motion of the Moon; \"month\" and \"Moon\" are cognates. The traditional concept arose with the cycle of Moon phases; such months (lunations) are synodic months and last approximately 29.53 days. From excavated tally sticks, researchers have deduced that people counted days in relation to the Moon's phases as early as the Paleolithic age. Synodic months, based on the Moon's orbital period with respect to the Earth-Sun line, are still the basis of many calendars today, and are used to divide the year.\n\nThe following types of months are mainly of significance in astronomy, most of them (but not the distinction between sidereal and tropical months) first recognized in Babylonian lunar astronomy.\n\n\nA synodic month is longer than a sidereal month because the Earth-Moon system is orbiting the Sun in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth. The Sun moves eastward with respect to the stars (as does the Moon) and it takes about 2.2 days longer for the Moon to return to the same apparent position with respect to the Sun.\n\nAn anomalistic month is longer than a sidereal month because the perigee moves in the same direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in nine years. Therefore, the Moon takes a little longer to return to perigee than to return to the same star.\n\nA draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month because the nodes move in the opposite direction as the Moon is orbiting the Earth, one revolution in 18.6 years. Therefore, the Moon returns to the same node slightly earlier than it returns to the same star.\n\nAt the simplest level, most well-known lunar calendars are based on the initial approximation that 2 lunations last 59 days: a 30-day full month followed by a 29-day hollow month — but this is only roughly accurate, and eventually needs correction by using larger cycles, or the equivalent of leap days. Additionally, the synodic month does not fit easily into the year, which makes accurate, rule-based lunisolar calendars complicated. The most common solution to this problem is the Metonic cycle, which takes advantage of the fact that 235 lunations are approximately 19 tropical years (which add up to not quite 6940 days). However, a Metonic calendar will drift against the seasons by about 1 day every 200 years. Metonic calendars include the calendar used in the Antikythera Mechanism about 2000 years ago, and the Hebrew calendar.\n\nThe complexity required in an accurate lunisolar calendar may explain why solar calendars (which have months which no longer relate to the phase of the Moon, but are based only on the motion of the Sun relative to the equinoxes and solstices) have generally replaced lunar calendars for civil use in most societies.\n\nThe Hellenic calendars, the Hebrew Lunisolar calendar and the Islamic Lunar calendar started the month with the first appearance of the thin crescent of the new moon.\n\nHowever, the motion of the Moon in its orbit is very complicated and its period is not constant. The date and time of this actual observation depends on the exact geographical longitude as well as latitude, atmospheric conditions, the visual acuity of the observers, etc. Therefore, the beginning and lengths of months defined by observation cannot be accurately predicted.\n\nWhile some like the Jewish Karaites still rely on actual moon observations, most people use the Gregorian solar calendar.\n\nPingelapese, a language from Micronesia, also uses a lunar calendar. There are 12 months associated with their calendar. The moon first appears in March, they name this month \"Kahlek\". This system has been used for hundreds of years and throughout many generations. This calendar is cyclical and relies on the position and shape of the moon.\n\nThe Gregorian calendar, like the Julian calendar before it, has twelve months:\n\nThe mean month length of the Gregorian calendar is 30.436875 days.\n\nMonths existing in the Roman calendar in the past include:\n\nThe famous mnemonic \"Thirty days hath September\" is a common way of teaching the lengths of the months in the English-speaking world.\n\nAlso, note that any five consecutive months (not including February) contain 153 days.\n\nThe knuckles of the four fingers of one's hand and the spaces between them can be used to remember the lengths of the months. By making a fist, each month will be listed as one proceeds across the hand. All months landing on a knuckle are 31 days long and those landing between them are not. When the knuckle of the index finger is reached (July), go back to the first knuckle (or over to the first knuckle on the other fist, held next to the first) and continue with August. This physical mnemonic has been taught to primary school students for many decades.\n\nThis cyclical pattern of month lengths matches the musical keyboard alternation of white and black keys (with the note 'F' correlating to the month of January).\n\nThe ides occur on the thirteenth day in eight of the months, but in March, May, July, and October, they occur on the fifteenth. The nones always occur 8 days (one Roman week) before the ides, i.e., on the fifth or the seventh. The calends are always the first day of the month, and before Julius Caesar's reform fell sixteen days (two Roman weeks) after the ides (except the ides of February and the intercalary month).\n\nThe Hebrew calendar has 12 or 13 months.\n\nAdar 1 is only added 7 times in 19 years.

Thus the narrative threads experienced by different but specific characters or sets of characters are those seen in the eyes of those characters that together form a plot element or subplot in the work of fiction. In this sense, each narrative thread is the narrative portion of a work that pertains to the world view of the participating characters cognizant of their piece of the whole, and they may be the villains, the protagonists, a supporting character, or a relatively disinterested official utilized by the author, each thread of which is woven together by the writer to create a work.\n\nBy utilizing different threads, the writer enables the reader to get pieces of the overall plot while positioning them to identify with the characters or experience the situation as if the reader were part of or eavesdropping upon the action the writer is divulging. This aids in the suspension of disbelief and engages the reader into the story as it develops.\n\nA classic structure of narrative thread often used in both fiction and non-fiction writing is the monomyth, or hero's journey, with a beginning, a middle, and an end. First, typically the harmony of daily life is broken by a particularly dramatic event that leads into the main story. Then, second, the plot builds to a point of no return, from where the protagonist – who need not be a person but may be an organization or a community – has no choice but to deal with matters, and thus is tested. At this point, characteristically, there is conflict and the conflict intensifies. Third, and finally, harmony is reestablished by the conflict being solved, or at least explained in the case of non-fiction.\n\n"}

{"id": "361643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=361643", "title": "Nicolae Iorga", "text": "Nicolae Iorga\n\nNicolae Iorga (; sometimes Neculai Iorga, Nicolas Jorga, Nicolai Jorga or Nicola Jorga, born Nicu N. Iorga; January 17, 1871 – November 27, 1940) was a Romanian historian, politician, literary critic, memoirist, poet and playwright. Co-founder (in 1910) of the Democratic Nationalist Party (PND), he served as a member of Parliament, President of the Deputies' Assembly and Senate, cabinet minister and briefly (1931–32) as Prime Minister. A child prodigy, polymath and polyglot, Iorga produced an unusually large body of scholarly works, consecrating his international reputation as a medievalist, Byzantinist, Latinist, Slavist, art historian and philosopher of history. Holding teaching positions at the University of Bucharest, the University of Paris and several other academic institutions, Iorga was founder of the International Congress of Byzantine Studies and the Institute of South-East European Studies (ISSEE). His activity also included the transformation of Vălenii de Munte town into a cultural and academic center.\n\nIn parallel with his scientific contributions, Nicolae Iorga was a prominent right-of-center activist, whose political theory bridged conservatism, Romanian nationalism, and agrarianism. From Marxist beginnings, he switched sides and became a maverick disciple of the \"Junimea\" movement. Iorga later became a leadership figure at \"Sămănătorul\", the influential literary magazine with populist leanings, and militated within the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, founding vocally conservative publications such as \"Neamul Românesc\", \"Drum Drept\", \"Cuget Clar\" and \"Floarea Darurilor\". His support for the cause of ethnic Romanians in Austria-Hungary made him a prominent figure in the pro-Entente camp by the time of World War I, and ensured him a special political role during the interwar existence of Greater Romania. Initiator of large-scale campaigns to defend Romanian culture in front of perceived threats, Iorga sparked most controversy with his antisemitic rhetoric, and was for long an associate of the far right ideologue A. C. Cuza. He was an adversary of the dominant National Liberals, later involved with the opposition Romanian National Party.\n\nLate in his life, Iorga opposed the radically fascist Iron Guard, and, after much oscillation, came to endorse its rival King Carol II. Involved in a personal dispute with the Guard's leader Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, and indirectly contributing to his killing, Iorga was also a prominent figure in Carol's corporatist and authoritarian party, the National Renaissance Front. He remained an independent voice of opposition after the Guard inaugurated its own National Legionary dictatorship, but was ultimately assassinated by a Guardist commando.\n\nNicolae Iorga was a native of Botoșani, and is generally believed to have been born on January 17, 1871 (although his birth certificate has June 6). His father Nicu Iorga (a practicing lawyer) and mother Zulnia (née Arghiropol) belonged to the Romanian Orthodox Church. Details on the family's more distant origins remain uncertain: Iorga was widely reputed to be of partial Greek-Romanian descent; the rumor, still credited by some commentators, was rejected by the historian. In his own account: \"My father was from a family of Romanian traders from Botoșani, who were later received into the boyar class, while my mother is the daughter of Romanian writer Elena Drăghici, the niece of chronicler Manolache Drăghici ... The [Greek] name Arghiropol notwithstanding, my maternal grandfather [was] from a family that moved in ... from Bessarabia\". Elsewhere, however, he acknowledged that the Arghiropols were possibly Byzantine Greeks. Iorga credited the five-generation-boyar status, received from his father's side, and the \"old boyar\" roots of his mother (the Miclescu family), with having turned him into a political man. His parallel claim of being related to noble families such as the Cantacuzinos and the Craiovești is questioned by other researchers.\n\nIn 1876, aged thirty-seven or thirty-eight, Nicu Sr. was incapacitated by an unknown illness and died, leaving Nicolae and his younger brother George orphans—a loss which, the historian would recall in writing, dominated the image he had of his own childhood. In 1878, he was enlisted at the Marchian Folescu School, where, as he took pride in noting, he excelled in most areas, discovering a love for intellectual pursuits and, by age nine, even being allowed by his teachers to lecture his schoolmates in Romanian history. His history teacher, a refugee Pole, sparked his interest in research and his lifelong Polonophilia. Iorga also credited this earliest formative period with having shaped his lifelong views on Romanian language and local culture: \"I learned Romanian ... as it was spoken back in the day: plainly, beautifully and above all resolutely and colorfully, without the intrusions of newspapers and best-selling books\". He credited the 19th century polymath Mihail Kogălniceanu, whose works he had first been reading as a child, with having shaped this literary preference.\n\nA student at Botoșani's A. T. Laurian gymnasium and high school after 1881, the young Iorga received top honors, and, beginning 1883, began tutoring some of his colleagues to increase his family's main revenue (according to Iorga, a \"miserable pension of pittance\"). Aged thirteen, while on extended visit to his maternal uncle Emanuel \"Manole\" Arghiropol, he also made his press debut with paid contributions to Arghiropol's \"Romanul\" newspaper, including anecdotes and editorial pieces on European politics. The year 1886 was described by Iorga as \"the catastrophe of my school life in Botoșani\": on temporary suspension for not having greeted a teacher, Iorga opted to leave the city and apply for the National High School () of Iași, being received into the scholarship program and praised by his new principal, the philologist Vasile Burlă. The adolescent was already fluent in French, Italian, Latin and Greek, later referring to Greek studies as \"the most refined form of human reasoning\".\n\nBy age seventeen, Iorga was becoming more rebellious. This was the time when he first grew interested in political activities, but displaying convictions which he later strongly disavowed: a self-confessed Marxist, Iorga promoted the left-wing magazine \"Viața Socială\", and lectured on \"Das Kapital\". Seeing himself confined in the National College's \"ugly and disgusting\" boarding school, he defied its rules and was suspended a second time, losing scholarship privileges. Before readmission, he decided not to fall back on his family's financial support, and instead returned to tutoring others. Again expelled for reading during a teacher's lesson, Iorga still graduated in the top \"first prize\" category (with a 9.24 average) and subsequently took his Baccalaureate with honors.\n\nIn 1888, Nicolae Iorga passed his entry examination for the University of Iași Faculty of Letters, becoming eligible for a scholarship soon after. Upon the completion of his second term, he also received a special dispensation from the Kingdom of Romania's Education Ministry, and, as a result, applied for and passed his third term examinations, effectively graduating one year ahead of his class. Before the end of the year, he also passed his license examination \"magna cum laude\", with a thesis on Greek literature, an achievement which consecrated his reputation inside both academia and the public sphere. Hailed as a \"morning star\" by the local press and deemed a \"wonder of a man\" by his teacher A. D. Xenopol, Iorga was honored by the faculty with a special banquet. Three academics (Xenopol, Nicolae Culianu, Ioan Caragiani) formally brought Iorga to the attention of the Education Ministry, proposing him for the state-sponsored program which allowed academic achievers to study abroad.\n\nThe interval witnessed Iorga's brief affiliation with \"Junimea\", a literary club with conservative leanings, whose informal leader was literary and political theorist Titu Maiorescu. In 1890, literary critic Ștefan Vârgolici and cultural promoter Iacob Negruzzi published Iorga's essay on poet Veronica Micle in the \"Junimist\" tribune \"Convorbiri Literare\". Having earlier attended the funeral of writer Ion Creangă, a dissident \"Junimist\" and Romanian literature classic, he took a public stand against the defamation of another such figure, the dramatist Ion Luca Caragiale, groundlessly accused of plagiarism by journalist Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion. He expanded his contribution as an opinion journalist, publishing with some regularity in various local or national periodicals of various leanings, from the socialist \"Contemporanul\" and \"Era Nouă\" to Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu's \"Revista Nouă\". This period saw his debut as a socialist poet (in \"Contemporanul\") and critic (in both \"Lupta\" and \"Literatură și Știință\").\n\nAlso in 1890, Iorga married Maria Tasu, whom he was to divorce in 1900. He had previously been in love with an Ecaterina C. Botez, but, after some hesitation, decided to marry into the family of \"Junimea\" man Vasile Tasu, much better situated in the social circles. Xenopol, who was Iorga's matchmaker, also tried to obtain for Iorga a teaching position at Iași University. The attempt was opposed by other professors, on grounds of Iorga's youth and politics. Instead, Iorga was briefly a high school professor of Latin in the southern city of Ploiești, following a public competition overseen by writer Alexandru Odobescu. The time he spent there allowed him to expand his circle of acquaintances and personal friends, meeting writers Caragiale and Alexandru Vlahuță, historians Hasdeu and Grigore Tocilescu, and Marxist theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea.\n\nHaving received the scholarship early in the year, he made his first study trips to Italy (April and June 1890), and subsequently left for a longer stay in France, enlisting at the \"École pratique des hautes études\". He was a contributor for the \"Encyclopédie française\", personally recommended there by Slavist Louis Léger. Reflecting back on this time, he stated: \"I never had as much time at my disposal, as much freedom of spirit, as much joy of learning from those great figures of mankind ... than back then, in that summer of 1890\". While preparing for his second diploma, Iorga also pursued his interest in philology, learning English, German, and rudiments of other Germanic languages. In 1892, he was in England and in Italy, researching historical sources for his French-language thesis on Philippe de Mézières, a Frenchman in the Crusade of 1365. In tandem, he became a contributor to \"Revue Historique\", a leading French academic journal.\n\nSomewhat dissatisfied with French education, Iorga presented his dissertation and, in 1893, left for the German Empire, attempting to enlist in the University of Berlin's Ph.D. program. His working paper, on Thomas III of Saluzzo, was not received, because Iorga had not spent three years in training, as required. As an alternative, he gave formal pledge that the paper in question was entirely his own work, but his statement was invalidated by technicality: Iorga's work had been redacted by a more proficient speaker of German, whose intervention did not touch the substance of Iorga's research. The ensuing controversy led him to apply for a University of Leipzig Ph.D.: his text, once reviewed by a commission grouping three prominent German scholars (Adolf Birch-Hirschfeld, Karl Gotthard Lamprecht, Charles Wachsmuth), earned him the needed diploma in August. On July 25, Iorga had also received his \"École pratique\" diploma for the earlier work on de Mézières, following its review by Gaston Paris and Charles Bémont. He spent his time further investigating the historical sources, at archives in Berlin, Leipzig and Dresden. Between 1890 and the end of 1893, he had published three works: his debut in poetry (\"Poezii\", \"Poems\"), the first volume of \"Schițe din literatura română\" (\"Sketches on Romanian Literature\", 1893; second volume 1894), and his Leipzig thesis, printed in Paris as \"Thomas III, marquis de Saluces. Étude historique et littéraire\" (\"Thomas, Margrave of Saluzzo. Historical and Literary Study\").\n\nLiving in poor conditions (as reported by visiting scholar Teohari Antonescu), the four-year engagement of his scholarship still applicable, Nicolae Iorga decided to spend his remaining time abroad, researching more city archives in Germany (Munich), Austria (Innsbruck) and Italy (Florence, Milan, Naples, Rome, Venice etc.). In this instance, his primordial focus was on historical figures from his Romanian homeland, the defunct Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia: the Moldavian Prince Peter the Lame, his son Ștefăniță, and Romania's national hero, the Wallachian Prince Michael the Brave. He also met, befriended and often collaborated with fellow historians from European countries other than Romania: the editors of \"Revue de l'Orient Latin\", who first published studies Iorga later grouped in the six volumes of \"Notes et extraits\" (\"Notices and Excerpts\") and Frantz Funck-Brentano, who enlisted his parallel contribution for \"Revue Critique\". Iorga's articles were also featured in two magazines for ethnic Romanian communities in Austria-Hungary: \"Familia\" and \"Vatra\".\n\nMaking his comeback to Romania in October 1894, Iorga settled in the capital city of Bucharest. He changed residence several times, until eventually settling in Grădina Icoanei area. He agreed to compete in a sort of debating society, with lectures which only saw print in 1944. He applied for the Medieval History Chair at the University of Bucharest, submitting a dissertation in front of an examination commission comprising historians and philosophers (Caragiani, Odobescu, Xenopol, alongside Aron Densușianu, Constantin Leonardescu and Petre Râșcanu), but totaled a 7 average which only entitled him to a substitute professor's position. The achievement, at age 23, was still remarkable in its context.\n\nThe first of his lectures came later that year as personal insight on the historical method, \"Despre concepția actuală a istoriei și geneza ei\" (\"On the Present-day Concept of History and Its Genesis\"). He was again out of the country in 1895, visiting the Netherlands and, again, Italy, in search of documents, publishing the first section of his extended historical records' collection \"Acte și fragmente cu privire la istoria românilor\" (\"Acts and Excerpts Regarding the History of Romanians\"), his Romanian Atheneum conference on Michael the Brave's rivalry with \"condottiero\" Giorgio Basta, and his debut in travel literature (\"Amintiri din Italia\", \"Recollections from Italy\"). The next year came Iorga's official appointment as curator and publisher of the Hurmuzachi brothers collection of historical documents, the position being granted to him by the Romanian Academy. The appointment, first proposed to the institution by Xenopol, overlapped with disputes over the Hurmuzachi inheritance, and came only after Iorga's formal pledge that he would renounce all potential copyrights resulting from his contribution. He also published the second part of \"Acte și fragmente\" and the printed rendition of the de Mézières study (\"Philippe de Mézières, 1337–1405\"). Following an October 1895 reexamination, he was granted full professorship with a 9.19 average.\n\n1895 was also the year when Iorga began his collaboration with the Iași-based academic and political agitator A. C. Cuza, making his earliest steps in antisemitic politics, founding with him a group known as the Universal ()and Romanian Antisemitic Alliance. In 1897, the year when he was elected a corresponding member of the Academy, Iorga traveled back to Italy and spent time researching more documents in the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, at Dubrovnik. He also oversaw the publication of the 10th Hurmuzachi volume, grouping diplomatic reports authored by Kingdom of Prussia diplomats in the two Danubian Principalities (covering the interval between 1703 and 1844). After spending most of 1898 on researching various subjects and presenting the results as reports for the Academy, Iorga was in Transylvania, the largely Romanian-inhabited subregion of Austria-Hungary. Concentrating his efforts on the city archives of Bistrița, Brașov and Sibiu, he made a major breakthrough by establishing that \"Stolnic\" Cantacuzino, a 17th-century man of letters and political intriguer, was the real author of an unsigned Wallachian chronicle that had for long been used as a historical source. He published several new books in 1899: \"Manuscrise din biblioteci străine\" (\"Manuscripts from Foreign Libraries\", 2 vols.), \"Documente românești din arhivele Bistriței\" (\"Romanian Documents from the Bistrița Archives\") and a French-language book on the Crusades, titled \"Notes et extraits pour servir à l'histoire des croisades\" (\"Notes and Excerpts Covering the History of the Crusades\", 2 vols.). Xenopol proposed his pupil for a Romanian Academy membership, to replace the suicidal Odobescu, but his proposition could not gather support.\n\nAlso in 1899, Nicolae Iorga inaugurated his contribution to the Bucharest-based French-language newspaper \"L'Indépendance Roumaine\", publishing polemical articles on the activity of his various colleagues and, as a consequence, provoking a lengthy scandal. The pieces often targeted senior scholars who, as favorites or activists of the National Liberal Party, opposed both \"Junimea\" and the Maiorescu-endorsed Conservative Party: his estranged friends Hasdeu and Tocilescu, as well as V. A. Urechia and Dimitrie Sturdza. The episode, described by Iorga himself as a stormy but patriotic debut in public affairs, prompted his adversaries at the Academy to demand the termination of his membership for undignified behavior. Tocilescu felt insulted by the allegations, challenged Iorga to a duel, but his friends intervened to mediate. Another scientist who encountered Iorga's wrath was George Ionescu-Gion, against whom Iorga enlisted negative arguments that, as he later admitted, were exaggerated. Among Iorga's main defenders were academics Dimitrie Onciul, N. Petrașcu, and, outside Romania, Gustav Weigand.\n\nThe young polemicist persevered in supporting this anti-establishment cause, moving on from \"L'Indépendance Roumaine\" to the newly established publication \"România Jună\", interrupting himself for trips to Italy, the Netherlands and Galicia-Lodomeria. In 1900, he collected the scattered polemical articles into the French-language books \"Opinions sincères. La vie intellectuelle des roumains en 1899\" (\"Honest Opinions. The Romanians' Intellectual Life in 1899\") and \"Opinions pérnicieuses d'un mauvais patriote\" (\"The Pernicious Opinions of a Bad Patriot\"). His scholarly activities resulted in a second trip into Transylvania, a second portion of his Bistrița archives collection, the 11th Hurmuzachi volume, and two works on early modern Romanian history: \"Acte din secolul al XVI-lea relative la Petru Șchiopul\" (\"16th Century Acts Relating to Peter the Lame\") and \"Scurtă istorie a lui Mihai Viteazul\" (\"A Short History of Michael the Brave\"). His controversial public attitude had nevertheless attracted an official ban on his Academy reports, and also meant that he was ruled out from the national Academy prize (for which distinction he had submitted \"Documente românești din arhivele Bistriței\"). The period also witnessed a chill in the Iorga's relationship with Xenopol.\n\nIn 1901, shortly after his divorce from Maria, Iorga married Ecaterina (Catinca), the sister of his friend and colleague Ioan Bogdan. Her other brother was cultural historian Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică, whose son, painter Catul Bogdan, Iorga would help achieve recognition. Soon after their wedding, the couple were in Venice, where Iorga received Karl Gotthard Lamprecht's offer to write a history of the Romanians to be featured as a section in a collective treatise of world history. Iorga, who had convinced Lamprecht not to assign this task to Xenopol, also completed \"Istoria literaturii române în secolul al XVIII-lea\" (\"The History of Romanian Literature in the 18th Century\"). It was presented to the Academy's consideration, but rejected, prompting the scholar to resign in protest. In order to receive his imprimatur later in the year, Iorga appealed to fellow intellectuals, earning pledges and a sizable grant from the aristocratic Callimachi family.\n\nBefore the end of that year, the Iorgas were in the Austro-Hungarian city of Budapest. While there, the historian set up tight contacts with Romanian intellectuals who originated from Transylvania and who, in the wake of the \"Transylvanian Memorandum\" affair, supported ethnic nationalism while objecting to the intermediary Cisleithanian (Hungarian Crown) rule and the threat of Magyarization. Interested in recovering the Romanian contributions to Transylvanian history, in particular Michael the Brave's precursory role in Romanian unionism, Iorga spent his time reviewing, copying and translating Hungarian-language historical texts with much assistance from his wife. During the 300th commemoration of Prince Michael's death, which ethnic Romanian students transformed into a rally against Austro-Hungarian educational restrictions, Iorga addressed the crowds and was openly greeted by the protest's leaders, poet Octavian Goga and Orthodox priest Ioan Lupaș. In 1902, he published new tracts on Transylvanian or Wallachian topics: \"Legăturile Principatelor române cu Ardealul\" (\"The Romanian Principalities' Links with Transylvania\"), \"Sate și preoți din Ardeal\" (\"Priests and Villages of Transylvania\"), \"Despre Cantacuzini\" (\"On the Cantacuzinos\"), \"Istoriile domnilor Țării Românești\" (\"The Histories of Wallachian Princes\").\n\nIorga was by then making known his newly found interest in cultural nationalism and national didacticism, as expressed by him in an open letter to Goga's Budapest-based \"Luceafărul\" magazine. After further interventions from Goga and linguist Sextil Pușcariu, \"Luceafărul\" became Iorga's main mouthpiece outside Romania. Returning to Bucharest in 1903, Iorga followed Lamprecht's suggestion and focused on writing his first overview of Romanian national history, known in Romanian as \"Istoria românilor\" (\"The History of the Romanians\"). He was also involved in a new project of researching the content of archives throughout Moldavia and Wallachia, and, having reassessed the nationalist politics of \"Junimist\" poet Mihai Eminescu, helped collect and publish a companion to Eminescu's work.\n\nAlso in 1903, Nicolae Iorga became one of the managers of \"Sămănătorul\" review. The moment brought Iorga's emancipation from Maiorescu's influence, his break with mainstream \"Junimism\", and his affiliation to the traditionalist, ethno-nationalist and neoromantic current encouraged by the magazine. The \"Sămănătorist\" school was by then also grouping other former or active \"Junimists\", and Maiorescu's progressive withdrawal from literary life also created a bridge with \"Convorbiri Literare\": its new editor, Simion Mehedinți, was himself a theorist of traditionalism. A circle of \"Junimists\" more sympathetic to Maiorescu's version of conservatism reacted against this realignment by founding its own venue, \"Convorbiri Critice\", edited by Mihail Dragomirescu.\n\nIn tandem with his full return to cultural and political journalism, which included prolonged debates with both the \"old\" historians and the \"Junimists\", Iorga was still active at the forefront of historical research. In 1904, he published the historical geography work \"Drumuri și orașe din România\" (\"Roads and Towns of Romania\") and, upon the special request of National Liberal Education Minister Spiru Haret, a work dedicated to the celebrated Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, published upon the 400th anniversary of the monarch's death as \"Istoria lui Ștefan cel Mare\" (\"The History of Stephen the Great\"). Iorga later confessed that the book was an integral part of his and Haret's didacticist agenda, supposed to be \"spread to the very bottom of the country in thousands of copies\". During those months, Iorga also helped discover novelist Mihail Sadoveanu, who was for a while the leading figure of \"Sămănătorist\" literature.\n\nIn 1905, the year when historian Onisifor Ghibu became his close friend and disciple, he followed up with over 23 individual titles, among them the two German-language volumes of \"Geschichte des Rümanischen Volkes im Rahmen seiner Staatsbildungen\" (\"A History of the Romanian People within the Context of Its National Formation\"), \"Istoria românilor în chipuri și icoane\" (\"The History of the Romanians in Faces and Icons\"), \"Sate și mănăstiri din România\" (\"Villages and Monasteries of Romania\") and the essay \"Gânduri și sfaturi ale unui om ca oricare altul\" (\"Thoughts and Advices from a Man Just like Any Other\"). He also paid a visits to the Romanians of Bukovina region, in Austrian territory, as well as to those of Bessarabia, who were subjects of the Russian Empire, and wrote about their cultural struggles in his 1905 accounts \"Neamul romănesc în Bucovina\" (\"The Romanian People of Bukovina\"), \"Neamul romănesc în Basarabia\" (\"...of Bessarabia\"). These referred to Tsarist autocracy as a source of \"darkness and slavery\", whereas the more liberal regime of Bukovina offered its subjects \"golden chains\".\n\nNicolae Iorga ran in the 1905 election and won a seat in Parliament's lower chamber. He remained politically independent until 1906, when he attached himself to the Conservative Party, making one final attempt to change the course of \"Junimism\". His move was contrasted by the group of left-nationalists from the Poporanist faction, who were allied to the National Liberals and, soon after, in open conflict with Iorga. Although from the same cultural family as \"Sămănătorul\", the Poporanist theorist Constantin Stere was dismissed by Iorga's articles, despite Sadoveanu's attempts to settle the matter.\n\nA peak in Nicolae Iorga's own nationalist campaigning occurred that year: profiting from a wave of Francophobia among young urbanites, Iorga boycotted the National Theater, punishing its staff for staging a play entirely in French, and disturbing public order. According to one of Iorga's young disciples, the future journalist Pamfil Șeicaru, the mood was such that Iorga could have led a successful \"coup d'état\". These events had several political consequences. The \"Siguranța Statului\" intelligence agency soon opened a file on the historian, informing Romanian Premier Sturdza about nationalist agitation. The perception that Iorga was a xenophobe also drew condemnation from more moderate traditionalist circles, in particular the \"Viața Literară\" weekly. Its panelists, Ilarie Chendi and young Eugen Lovinescu, ridiculed Iorga's claim of superiority; Chendi in particular criticized the rejection of writers based on their ethnic origin and not their ultimate merit (while alleging, to Iorga's annoyance, that Iorga himself was a Greek).\n\nIorga eventually parted with \"Sămănătorul\" in late 1906, moving on to set up his own tribune, \"Neamul Românesc\". The schism was allegedly a direct result of his conflicts with other literary venues, and inaugurated a brief collaboration between Iorga and \"Făt Frumos\" journalist Emil Gârleanu. The newer magazine, illustrated with idealized portraits of the Romanian peasant, was widely popular with Romania's rural intelligentsia (among which it was freely distributed), promoting antisemitic theories and raising opprobrium from the authorities and the urban-oriented press.\n\nAlso in 1906, Iorga traveled into the Ottoman Empire, visiting Istanbul, and published another set of volumes—\"Contribuții la istoria literară\" (\"Contributions to Literary History\"), \"Neamul românesc în Ardeal și Țara Ungurească\" (\"The Romanian Nation in Transylvania and the Hungarian Land\"), \"Negoțul și meșteșugurile în trecutul românesc\" (\"Trade and Crafts of the Romanian Past\") etc. In 1907, he began issuing a second periodical, the cultural magazine \"Floarea Darurilor\", and published with Editura Minerva an early installment of his companion to Romanian literature (second volume 1908, third volume 1909). His published scientific contributions for that year include, among others, an English-language study on the Byzantine Empire. At home, he and pupil Vasile Pârvan were involved in a conflict with fellow historian Orest Tafrali, officially over archeological theory, but also because of a regional conflict in academia: Bucharest and Transylvania against Tafrali's Iași.\n\nA seminal moment in Iorga's political career took place during the 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt, erupting under a Conservative cabinet and repressed with much violence by a National Liberal one. The bloody outcome prompted the historian to author and make public a piece of social critique, the \"Neamul Românesc\" pamphlet \"Dumnezeu să-i ierte\" (\"God Forgive Them\"). The text, together with his program of agrarian conferences and his subscription lists for the benefit of victims' relatives again made him an adversary of the National Liberals, who referred to Iorga as an instigator. The historian did however struck a chord with Stere, who had been made prefect of Iași County, and who, going against his party's wishes, inaugurated an informal collaboration between Iorga and the Poporanists. The political class as a whole was particularly apprehensive of Iorga's contacts with the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians and their common irredentist agenda, which risked undermining relations with the Austrians over Transylvania and Bukovina. However, Iorga's popularity was still increasing, and, carried by this sentiment, he was first elected to Chamber during the elections of that same year.\n\nIorga and his new family had relocated several times, renting a home in Bucharest's Gara de Nord (Buzești) quarter. After renewed but failed attempts to become an Iași University professor, he decided, in 1908, to set his base away from the urban centers, at a villa in Vălenii de Munte town (nestled in the remote hilly area of Prahova County). Although branded an agitator by Sturdza, he received support in this venture from Education Minister Haret. Once settled, Iorga set up a specialized summer school, his own publishing house, a printing press and the literary supplement of \"Neamul Românesc\", as well as an asylum managed by writer Constanța Marino-Moscu. He published some 25 new works for that year, such as the introductory volumes for his German-language companion to Ottoman history (\"Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches\", \"History of the Ottoman Empire\"), a study on Romanian Orthodox institutions (\"Istoria bisericii românești\", \"The History of the Romanian Church\"), and an anthology on Romanian Romanticism. He followed up in 1909 with a volume of parliamentary speeches, \"În era reformelor\" (\"In the Age of Reforms\"), a book on the 1859 Moldo–Wallachian Union (\"Unirea principatelor\", \"The Principalities' Union\"), and a critical edition of poems by Eminescu. Visiting Iași for the Union Jubilee, Iorga issued a public and emotional apology to Xenopol for having criticized him in the previous decade.\n\nAt that stage in his life, Iorga became an honorary member of the Romanian Writers' Society. He had militated for its creation in both \"Sămănătorul\" and \"Neamul Românesc\", but also wrote against its system of fees. Once liberated from government restriction in 1909, his Vălenii school grew into a hub of student activity, self-financed through the sale of postcards. Its success caused alarm in Austria-Hungary: \"Budapesti Hírlap\" newspaper described Iorga's school as an instrument for radicalizing Romanian Transylvanians. Iorga also alienated the main Romanian organizations in Transylvania: the Romanian National Party (PNR) dreaded his proposal to boycott the Diet of Hungary, particularly since PNR leaders were contemplating a loyalist \"Greater Austria\" devolution project.\n\nThe consequences hit Iorga in May 1909, when he was stopped from visiting Bukovina, officially branded a \"persona non grata\", and expelled from Austrian soil (in June, it was made illegal for Bukovinan schoolteachers to attend Iorga's lectures). A month later, Iorga greeted in Bucharest the English scholar R.W. Seton-Watson. This noted critic of Austria-Hungary became Iorga's admiring friend, and helped popularize his ideas in the English-speaking world.\n\nIn 1910, the year when he toured the Old Kingdom's conference circuit, Nicolae Iorga again rallied with Cuza to establish the explicitly antisemitic Democratic Nationalist Party. Partly building on the antisemitic component of the 1907 revolts, its doctrines depicted the Jewish-Romanian community and Jews in general as a danger for Romania's development. During its early decades, it used as its symbol the right-facing swastika (卐), promoted by Cuza as the symbol of worldwide antisemitism and, later, of the \"Aryans\". Also known as PND, this was Romania's first political group to represent the petty bourgeoisie, using its votes to challenge the tri-decennial two-party system.\n\nAlso in 1910, Iorga published some thirty new works, covering gender history (\"Viața femeilor în trecutul românesc\", \"The Early Life of Romanian Women\"), Romanian military history (\"Istoria armatei românești\", \"The History of the Romanian Military\") and Stephen the Great's Orthodox profile (\"Ștefan cel Mare și mănăstirea Neamțului\", \"Stephen the Great and Neamț Monastery\"). His academic activity also resulted in a lengthy conflict with art historian Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, his godfather and former friend, sparked when Iorga, defending his own academic postings, objected to making Art History a separate subject at University.\n\nReinstated into the Academy and made a full member, he gave his May 1911 reception speech with a philosophy of history subject (\"Două concepții istorice\", \"Two Historical Outlooks\") and was introduced on the occasion by Xenopol. In August of that year, he was again in Transylvania, at Blaj, where he paid homage to the Romanian-run ASTRA Cultural Society. He made his first contribution to Romanian drama with the play centered on, and named after, Michael the Brave (\"Mihai Viteazul\"), one of around twenty new titles for that year—alongside his collected aphorisms (\"Cugetări\", \"Musings\") and a memoir of his life in culture (\"Oameni cari au fost\", \"People Who Are Gone\"). In 1912, he published, among other works, \"Trei drame\" (\"Three Dramatic Plays\"), grouping \"Mihai Viteazul\", \"Învierea lui Ștefan cel Mare\" (\"Stephen the Great's Resurrection\") and \"Un domn pribeag\" (\"An Outcast Prince\"). Additionally, Iorga produced the first of several studies dealing with Balkan geopolitics in the charged context leading up to the Balkan Wars (\"România, vecinii săi și chestia Orientală\", \"Romania, Her Neighbors and the Eastern Question\"). He also made a noted contribution to ethnography, with \"Portul popular românesc\" (\"Romanian Folk Dress\").\n\nIn 1913, Iorga was in London for an International Congress of History, presenting a proposal for a new approach to medievalism and a paper discussing the sociocultural effects of the fall of Constantinople on Moldavia and Wallachia. He was later in the Kingdom of Serbia, invited by the Belgrade Academy and presenting dissertations on Romania–Serbia relations and the Ottoman decline. Iorga was even called under arms in the Second Balkan War, during which Romania fought alongside Serbia and against the Kingdom of Bulgaria. The subsequent taking of Southern Dobruja, supported by Maiorescu and the Conservatives, was seen by Iorga as callous and imperialistic.\n\nIorga's interest in the Balkan crisis was illustrated by two of the forty books he put out that year: \"Istoria statelor balcanice\" (\"The History of Balkan States\") and \"Notele unui istoric cu privire la evenimentele din Balcani\" (\"A Historian's Notes on the Balkan Events\"). Noted among the others is the study focusing on the early 18th century reign of Wallachian Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu (\"Viața și domnia lui Constantin vodă Brâncoveanu\", \"The Life and Rule of Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu\"). That same year, Iorga issued the first series of his \"Drum Drept\" monthly, later merged with the \"Sămănătorist\" magazine \"Ramuri\". Iorga managed to publish roughly as many new titles in 1914, the year when he received a Romanian \"Bene Merenti\" distinction, and inaugurated the international Institute of South-East European Studies or ISSEE (founded through his efforts), with a lecture on Albanian history.\n\nAgain invited to Italy, he spoke at the \"Ateneo Veneto\" on the relations between the Republic of Venice and the Balkans, and again about \"Settecento\" culture. His attention was focused on the Albanians and Arbëreshë—Iorga soon discovered the oldest record of written Albanian, the 1462 \"Formula e pagëzimit\". In 1916, he founded the Bucharest-based academic journal \"Revista Istorică\" (\"The Historical Review\"), a Romanian equivalent for \"Historische Zeitschrift\" and \"The English Historical Review\".\n\nNicolae Iorga's involvement in political disputes and the cause of Romanian irredentism became a leading characteristic of his biography during World War I. In 1915, while Romania was still keeping neutral, he sided with the dominant nationalist, Francophile and pro-Entente camp, urging for Romania to wage war on the Central Powers as a means of obtaining Transylvania, Bukovina and other regions held by Austria-Hungary; to this goal, he became an active member of the Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians, and personally organized the large pro-Entente rallies in Bucharest. A prudent anti-Austrian, Iorga adopted the interventionist agenda with noted delay. His hesitation was ridiculed by hawkish Eugen Lovinescu as pro-Transylvanian but anti-war, costing Iorga his office in the Cultural League. The historian later confessed that, like Premier Ion I. C. Brătianu and the National Liberal cabinet, he had been waiting for a better moment to strike. In the end, his \"Ententist\" efforts were closely supported by public figures such as Alexandru I. Lapedatu and Ion Petrovici, as well as by Take Ionescu's National Action advocacy group. Iorga was also introduced to the private circle of Romania's young King, Ferdinand I, whom he found well-intentioned but weak-willed. Iorga is sometimes credited as a tutor to Crown Prince Carol (future King Carol II), who reportedly attended the Vălenii school.\n\nIn his October 1915 polemic with Vasile Sion, a Germanophile physician, Iorga at once justified suspicion of the German Romanians and praised those Romanians who were deserting the Austrian Army. The Ententists' focus on Transylvania pitted them against the Poporanists, who deplored the Romanians of Bessarabia. That region, the Poporanist lobby argued, was being actively oppressed by the Russian Empire with the acquiescence of other Entente powers. Poporanist theorist Garabet Ibrăileanu, editor of \"Viața Românească\" review, later accused Iorga of not ever speaking in support of the Bessarabians.\n\nPolitical themes were again reflected in Nicolae Iorga's 1915 report to the Academy (\"Dreptul la viață al statelor mici\", \"The Small States' Right to Exist\") and in various of the 37 books he published that year: \"Istoria românilor din Ardeal și Ungaria\" (\"The History of the Romanians in Transylvania and Hungary\"), \"Politica austriacă față de Serbia\" (\"The Austrian Policy on Serbia\") etc. Also in 1915, Iorga completed his economic history treatise, \"Istoria comerțului la români\" (\"The History of Commerce among the Romanians\"), as well as a volume on literary history and Romanian philosophy, \"Faze sufletești și cărți reprezentative la români\" (\"Spiritual Phases and Relevant Books of the Romanians\"). Before spring 1916, he was commuting between Bucharest and Iași, substituting the ailing Xenopol at Iași University. He also gave a final touch to the collection \"Studii și documente\" (\"Studies and Documents\"), comprising his commentary on 30,000 individual documents and spread over 31 tomes.\n\nIn late summer 1916, as Brătianu's government sealed an alliance with the Entente, Iorga expressed his joy in a piece named \"Ceasul\" (\"The Hour\"): \"the hour we have been expecting for over two centuries, for which we have been living our entire national life, for which we have been working and writing, fighting and thinking, has at long last arrived.\" Nevertheless, the Romanian campaign ended in massive defeat, forcing the Romanian Army and the entire administration to evacuate the southern areas, Bucharest included, in front of a German-led occupation. Iorga's home in Vălenii de Munte was among the property items left behind and seized by the occupiers, and, according to Iorga's own claim, was vandalized by the \"Deutsches Heer\".\n\nStill a member of Parliament, Iorga joined the authorities in the provisional capital of Iași, but opposed the plans of relocating government out of besieged Moldavia and into the Russian Republic. The argument was made in one of his parliamentary speeches, printed as a pamphlet and circulated among the military: \"May the dogs of this world feast on us sooner than to find our happiness, tranquility and prosperity granted by the hostile foreigner.\" He did however allow some of his notebooks to be stored in Moscow, along with the Romanian Treasure, and sheltered his own family in Odessa.\n\nIorga, who reissued \"Neamul Românesc\" in Iași, resumed his activity at Iași University and began working on the war propaganda daily \"România\", while contributing to R.W. Seton-Watson's international sheet \"The New Europe\". His contribution for that year included a number of brochures dedicated to maintaining morale among soldiers and civilians: \"Războiul actual și urmările lui în viața morală a omenirii\" (\"The Current War and Its Effects on the Moral Life of Mankind\"), \"Rolul inițiativei private în viața publică\" (\"The Role of Private Initiative in Public Life\"), \"Sfaturi și învățături pentru ostașii României\" (\"Advices and Teachings for Romania's Soldiers\") etc. He also translated from English and printed \"My Country\", a patriotic essay by Ferdinand's wife Marie of Edinburgh.\n\nThe heightened sense of crisis prompted Iorga to issue appeals against defeatism and reissue \"Neamul Românesc\" from Iași, explaining: \"I realized at once what moral use could come out of this for the thousands of discouraged and disillusioned people and against the traitors who were creeping up all over the place.\" The goal was again reflected in his complementary lectures (where he discussed the \"national principle\") and a new set of works; these featured musings on the Allied commitment (\"Relations des Roumains avec les Alliès\", \"The Romanians' Relations with the Allies\"; \"Histoire des relations entre la France et les roumains\", \"The History of Relations between France and the Romanians\"), the national character (\"Sufletul românesc\", \"The Romanian Soul\") or columns against the loss of morale (\"Armistițiul\", \"The Armistice\"). His ideal of moral regeneration through the war effort came with an endorsement of land reform projects. Brătianu did not object to the idea, being however concerned that landowners would rebel. Iorga purportedly gave him a sarcastic reply: \"just like you've been shooting the peasants to benefit the landowners, you'll then be shooting the landowners to benefit the peasants.\"\n\nIn May 1918, Romania yielded to German demands and negotiated the Bucharest Treaty, an effective armistice. The conditions were judged humiliating by Iorga (\"Our ancestors would have preferred death\"); he refused to regain his University of Bucharest chair. The German authorities in Bucharest reacted by blacklisting the historian.\n\nIorga only returned to Bucharest as Romania resumed its contacts with the Allies and the \"Deutsches Heer\" left the country. The political uncertainty ended by late autumn, when the Allied victory on the Western Front sealed Germany's defeat. Celebrating the Compiègne Armistice, Iorga wrote: \"There can be no greater day for the entire world\". Iorga however found that Bucharest had become \"a filthy hell under lead skies.\" His celebrated return also included the premiere of \"Învierea lui Ștefan cel Mare\" at the National Theater, which continued to host productions of his dramatic texts on a regular basis, until ca. 1936.\n\nHe was reelected to the lower chamber in the June 1918 election, becoming President of the body and, due to the rapid political developments, the first person to hold this office in the history of Greater Romania. The year also brought his participation alongside Allied envoys in the 360th anniversary of Michael the Brave's birth. On December 1, later celebrated as Great Union Day, Iorga was participant in a seminal event of the union with Transylvania, as one of several thousand Romanians who gathered in Alba Iulia to demand union on the basis of self-determination. Despite these successes, Iorga was reportedly snubbed by King Ferdinand, and only left to rely on Brătianu for support. Although he was not invited to attend the Paris Peace Conference, he supported Queen Marie in her role of informal negotiatior for Romania, and cemented his friendship with her.\n\nShortly after the creation of Greater Romania, Iorga was focusing his public activity on exposing collaborators of the wartime occupiers. The subject was central to a 1919 speech he held in front of the Academy, where he obtained the public condemnation of actively Germanophile academicians, having earlier vetoed the membership of Poporanist Constantin Stere. He failed at enlisting support for the purge of Germanophile professors from University, but the attempt rekindled the feud between him and Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș, who had served in the German-appointed administration. The two scholars later took their battle to court and, until Iorga's death, presented mutually exclusive takes on recent political history. Although very much opposed to the imprisoned Germanophile poet Tudor Arghezi, Iorga intervened on his behalf with Ferdinand.\n\nFollowing November 1919 elections, Iorga became a member of the Senate, representing the Democratic Nationalists. Although he resented the universal male suffrage and viewed the adoption of electoral symbols as promoting political illiteracy, his PND came to use a logo representing two hands grasping (later replaced with a black-flag-and-sickle). The elections seemed to do away with the old political system: Iorga's party was third, trailing behind two newcomers, the Transylvanian PNR and the Poporanist Peasants' Party (PȚ), with whom it formed a parliamentary bloc supporting an Alexandru Vaida-Voevod cabinet. This union of former rivals also showed Iorga's growing suspicion of Brătianu, whom he feared intended to absorb the PND into the National Liberal Party, and accused of creating a political machine. He and his disciples were circulating the term \"politicianism\" (\"politicking\"), expressing their disappointment for the new political context.\n\nAlso in 1919, Iorga was elected chairman of the Cultural League, where he gave a speech on \"the Romanians' rights to their national territory\", was appointed head of the Historical Monuments' Commission, and met the French academic mission to Romania (Henri Mathias Berthelot, Charles Diehl, Emmanuel de Martonne and Raymond Poincaré, whom he greeted with a speech about the Romanians and the Romance peoples). Together with French war hero Septime Gorceix, he also compiled \"Anthologie de la littérature roumaine\" (\"An Anthology of Romanian Literature\"). That year, the French state granted Iorga its Legion of Honor.\n\nA founding president of the Association of Romanian Public Libraries, Iorga was also tightening his links with young Transylvanian intellectuals: he took part in reorganizing the Cluj Franz Joseph University into a Romanian-speaking institution, meeting scholars Vasile Pârvan and Vasile Bogrea (who welcomed him as \"our protective genius\"), and published a praise of the young traditionalist poet Lucian Blaga. He was in correspondence with intellectuals of all backgrounds, and, reportedly, the Romanian who was addressed the most letters in postal history. Touring the larger conference circuit, he also wrote some 30 new books, among them: \"Histoire des roumains de la Peninsule des Balcans\" (\"The History of Romanians from the Balkan Peninsula\": Aromanians, Istro-Romanians and Megleno-Romanians), \"Istoria poporului francez\" (\"The History of the French People\"), \"Pentru sufletele celor ce muncesc\" (\"For The Souls of Working Men\"), and \"Istoria lui Mihai Viteazul\" (\"The History of Michael the Brave\"). Iorga was awarded the title of doctor \"honoris causa\" by the University of Strasbourg, while his lectures on Albania, collected by poet Lasgush Poradeci, became \"Brève histoire de l'Albanie\" (\"Concise History of Albania\"). In Bucharest, Iorga received as a gift from his admirers a new Bucharest home on Bonaparte Highway (Iancu de Hunedoara Boulevard).\n\nIorga's parliamentary bloc crumbled in late March 1920, when Ferdinand dissolved Parliament. During the spring 1920 election, Iorga was invited by journalist Sever Dan to run for a deputy seat in Transylvania, but eventually participated in and won the election of his earlier constituency, Covurlui County. At that stage, Iorga was resenting the PNR for holding onto its regional government of Transylvania, and criticizing the PȚ for its claim to represent all Romanian peasants. In March 1921, Iorga again turned on Stere. The latter had since been forgiven for his wartime stance, decorated for negotiating the Bessarabian union, and elected on PȚ lists in Soroca County. Iorga's speech, \"Stere's Betrayal\", turned attention back to Stere's Germanophilia (with quotes that were supposedly taken out of context) and demanded his invalidation—the subsequent debate was tense and emotional, but a new vote in Chamber confirmed Stere as Soroca deputy.\n\nThe overall election victory belonged to the radical, eclectic and anti-PNR People's Party, led by war hero Alexandru Averescu. Iorga, whose PND had formed the Federation of National Democracy with the PȚ and other parties, was perplexed by Averescu's \"sui generis\" appeal and personality cult, writing: \"Everything [in that party] was about Averescu.\" His partner Cuza and a portion of the PND were however supportive of this force, which threatened the stability of their vote. Progressively after that moment, Iorga also began toning down his antisemitism, a process of the end of which Cuza left the Democratic Nationalists to establish the more militant National-Christian Defense League (1923). Iorga's suggestions that new arrivals from Transylvania and Bessarabia were becoming a clique also resulted in collisions with former friend Octavian Goga, who had joined up with Averescu's party.\n\nHis publishing activity continued at a steady pace during that year, when he first presided over the Romanian School of Fontenay-aux-Roses; he issued the two volumes of \"Histoire des roumains et de leur civilisation\" (\"The History of the Romanians and Their Civilization\") and the three tomes of \"Istoria românilor prin călătorii\" (\"The History of the Romanians in Travels\"), alongside \"Ideea Daciei românești\" (\"The Idea of a Romanian Dacia\"), \"Istoria Evului Mediu\" (\"The History of the Middle Ages\") and some other scholarly works. His biographical studies were mainly focused on his nationalist predecessor Mihail Kogălniceanu. Iorga also resumed his writing for the stage, with two new drama plays: one centered on the Moldavian ruler Constantin Cantemir (\"Cantemir bătrânul\", \"Cantemir the Elder\"), the other dedicated to, and named after, Brâncoveanu. Centering his activity as a public speaker in Transylvanian cities, Iorga was also involved in projects to organize folk theaters throughout the country, through which he intended to spread a unified cultural message. The year also brought his presence at the funeral of A. D. Xenopol.\n\nIn 1921 and 1922, the Romanian scholar began lecturing abroad, most notably at the University of Paris, while setting up a Romanian School in the French capital and the \"Accademia di Romania\" of Rome. In 1921, when his 50th birthday was celebrated at a national level, Iorga published a large number of volumes, including a bibliographic study on the Wallachian uprising of 1821 and its leader Tudor Vladimirescu, an essay on political history (\"Dezvoltarea așezămintelor politice\", \"The Development of Political Institutions\"), \"Secretul culturii franceze\" (\"The Secret of French Culture\"), \"Războiul nostru în note zilnice\" (\"Our War as Depicted in Daily Records\") and the French-language \"Les Latins de l'Orient\" (\"The Oriental Latins\"). His interest in Vladimirescu and his historical role was also apparent in an eponymous play, published with a volume of Iorga's selected lyric poetry.\n\nIn politics, Iorga began objecting to the National Liberals' hold on power, denouncing the 1922 election as a fraud. He resumed his close cooperation with the PNR, briefly joining the party ranks in an attempt to counter this monopoly. In 1923, he donated his Bonaparte Highway residence and its collection to the Ministry of Education, to be used by a cultural foundation and benefit university students. Receiving another \"honoris causa\" doctorate, from the University of Lyon, Iorga went through an episode of reconciliation with Tudor Arghezi, who addressed him public praise. The two worked together on \"Cuget Românesc\" newspaper, but were again at odds when Iorga began criticizing modernist literature and \"the world's spiritual crisis\".\n\nAmong his published works for that year were \"Formes byzantines et réalités balcaniques\" (\"Byzantine Forms and Balkan Realities\"), \"Istoria presei românești\" (\"The History of the Romanian Press\"), \"L'Art populaire en Roumanie\" (\"Folk Art in Romania\"), \"Istoria artei medievale\" (\"The History of Medieval Art\") and \"Neamul românesc din Ardeal\" (\"The Romanian Nation in Transylvania\"). Iorga had by then finished several new theatrical plays: \"Moartea lui Dante\" (\"The Death of Dante\"), \"Molière se răzbună\" (\"Molière Gets His Revenge\"), \"Omul care ni trebuie\" (\"The Man We Need\") and \"Sărmală, amicul poporului\" (\"Sărmală, Friend of the People\").\n\nA major moment in Iorga's European career took place in 1924, when he convened in Bucharest the first-ever International Congress of Byzantine Studies, attended by some of the leading experts in the field. He also began lecturing at Ramiro Ortiz's Italian Institute in Bucharest. Also then, Iorga was appointed Aggregate Professor by the University of Paris, received the honor of having foreign scholars lecturing at the Vălenii de Munte school, and published a number of scientific works and essays, such as: \"Brève histoire des croissades\" (\"A Short History of the Crusades\"), \"Cărți reprezentative din viața omenirii\" (\"Books Significant for Mankind's Existence\"), \"România pitorească\" (\"Picturesque Romania\") and a volume of addresses to the Romanian American community. In 1925, when he was elected a member of the Kraków Academy of Learning in Poland, Iorga gave conferences in various European countries, including Switzerland (where he spoke at a League of Nations assembly on the state of Romania's minorities). His bibliography for 1925 includes some 50 titles. Iorga also increased his personal fortune, constructing villas in two resort towns: in Sinaia (designer: Toma T. Socolescu) and, later, Mangalia. More controversial still was his decision to use excess funds from the International Congress to improve his Vălenii printing press.\n\nIorga was again abroad in 1926 and 1927, lecturing on various subjects at reunions in France, Italy, Switzerland, Denmark, Spain, Sweden and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, many of his works being by then translated into French, English, German and Italian. His work for 1926 centered on the first of four volumes in his series \"Essai de synthèse de l'histoire de l'humanité\" (\"Essay on the Synthesis of World History\"), followed in 1927 by \"Istoria industriei la români\" (\"The History of Industry among the Romanians\"), \"Originea și sensul democrației\" (\"The Origin and Sense of Democracy\"), a study of Romanian contributions to the 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War (\"Războiul de independență\", \"The War of Independence\") etc. At home, the PND's merge into the PNR, accepted by Iorga, was stopped once the historian asked to become the resulting union's chief. Acting PNR leader Iuliu Maniu successfully resisted this move, and the two parties split over the issue.\n\nFor a while in 1927, Iorga was also local leader of the Pan-European movement, created internationally by Graf Coudenhove-Kalergi. A \"honoris causa\" doctor of Genoa University, he opened his course at the University of Paris with lectures on France's Levantine policy (1927) and, during 1928, was again invited to lecture in Spain, Sweden and Norway. His published works for that time grouped the political essay \"Evoluția ideii de libertate\" (\"The Evolution of Liberty as an Idea\"), new historical studies and printed versions of his conferences: \"Istoria învățământului\" (\"The History of Education\"), \"Patru conferințe despre istoria Angliei\" (\"Four Conferences on the History of England\"), \"Țara latină cea mai îndepărtată din Europa: Portugalia\" (\"The Remotest Latin Country in Europe: Portugal\"). In addition to his Bucharest Faculty of History chair, Iorga also took over the History of Literature course hosted by the same institution (1928).\n\nAppointed the university's Rector in 1929, he followed up with new sets of conferences in France, Italy or Spain, and published some 40 new books on topics such as Romanian folklore and Scandinavian history. For a while, he also held the University's concise literature course, replacing Professor Ioan Bianu. Iorga's circle was joined by researcher Constantin C. Giurescu, son of historian Constantin Giurescu, who had been Iorga's rival a generation before.\n\nIorga embarked on a longer journey during 1930: again lecturing in Paris during January, he left for Genoa and, from there, traveled to the United States, visiting some 20 cities, being greeted by the Romanian-American community and meeting with President Herbert Hoover. He was also an honored guest of Case Western Reserve University, where he delivered a lecture in English. Returning to attend the London International Congress of History, Iorga was also made a \"honoris causa\" doctor by the University of Oxford (with a reception speech likening him to both Livy and Pliny the Elder). That year, he also set up the \"Casa Romena\" institute in Venice. His new works included \"America și românii din America\" (\"Romania and the Romanians of America\") and \"Priveliști elvețiene\" (\"Swiss Landscapes\"), alongside the plays \"Sfântul Francisc\" (\"Saint Francis\") and \"Fiul cel pierdut\" (\"The Lost Son\"). In 1931–1932, he was made a \"honoris causa\" doctor by four other universities (the University of Paris, La Sapienza, Stefan Batory, Comenius), was admitted into both \"Accademia dei Lincei\" and the \"Accademia degli Arcadi\", and published over 40 new titles per year.\n\nIorga became Romanian Premier in April 1931, upon the request of Carol II, who had returned from exile to replace his own son, Michael I. The authoritarian monarch had cemented this relationship by visiting the Vălenii de Munte establishment in July 1930. A contemporary historian, Hugh Seton-Watson (son of R.W. Seton-Watson), documented Carol's confiscation of agrarian politics for his own benefit, noting: \"Professor Iorga's immense vanity delivered him into the king's hands.\" Iorga's imprudent ambition is mentioned by cultural historian Z. Ornea, who also counts Iorga among those who had already opposed Carol's invalidation. In short while, Iorga's support for the controversial monarch resulted in his inevitable break with the PNR and PȚ. Their agrarian union, the National Peasants' Party (PNȚ), took distance from Carol's policies, whereas Iorga prioritized his \"Carlist\" monarchism. For a while, Iorga was a member of the PNȚ, but rejected its policies. There was a running personal rivalry between him and PNȚ leader Iuliu Maniu, even though Iorga had on his side Maniu's own brother, lawyer Cassiu Maniu.\n\nOnce confirmed on the throne, Carol experimented with technocracy, borrowing professionals from various political groups, and closely linking Iorga with Internal Affairs Minister Constantin Argetoianu. Iorga survived the election of June, in which he led a National Union coalition, with support from his rivals, the National Liberals. During his short term, he traveled throughout the country, visiting around 40 cities and towns, and was notably on a state visit to France, being received by Prime Minister Aristide Briand and by Briand's ally André Tardieu. In recognition of his merits as an Albanologist, the Albanian Kingdom granted Iorga property in Sarandë town, on which the scholar created a Romanian Archeological Institute.\n\nThe backdrop to Iorga's mandate was Carol's conflict with the Iron Guard, an increasingly popular fascist organization. In March 1932, Iorga signed a decree outlawing the movement, the beginning of his clash with the Guard's founder Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. At the same time, his new education law enhancing university autonomy, for which Iorga had been campaigning since the 1920s, was openly challenged as unrealistic by fellow scholar Florian Ștefănescu-Goangă, who noted that it only encouraged political agitators to place themselves outside the state. Also holding the office of Education Minister, he allowed auditing students to attend university lectures without holding a Romanian Baccalaureate degree. Reserving praise for the home-grown youth movement \"Micii Dorobanți\", he was also an official backer of Romanian Scouting. In addition, Iorga's time in office brought the creation of another popular summer school, in the tourist resort of Balcic, Southern Dobruja.\n\nThe major issue facing Iorga was the economic crisis, part of the Great Depression, and he was largely unsuccessful in tackling it. To the detriment of financial markets, the cabinet tried to implement debt relief for bankrupt land cultivators, and signed an agreement with Argentina, another exporter of agricultural produce, to try to limit deflation. The mishandling of economic affairs made the historian a target of derision and indignation among the general public. The reduction of deficit with pay cuts for all state employees (\"sacrificial curves\") or selective layoffs was particularly dramatic, leading to widespread disillusionment among the middle class, which only increased grassroots support for the Iron Guard. Other controversial aspects were his alleged favoritism and nepotism: perceived as the central figure of an academic clique, Iorga helped Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică's family and Pârvan, promoted young historian Andrei Oțetea, and made his son in law Colonel Chirescu (m. Florica Iorga in 1918) a Prefect of Storojineț County. His premiership also evidenced the growing tensions between the PND in Bucharest and its former allies in Transylvania: Iorga arrived to power after rumors of a PNȚ \"Transylvanian conspiracy\", and his cabinet included no Romanian Transylvanian politicians. It was however open to members of the Saxon community, and Iorga himself created a new government position for ethnic minority affairs.\n\nNicolae Iorga presented his cabinet's resignation in May 1932, returning to academic life. This came after an understanding between Carol II and a rightist PNȚ faction, who took over with Alexandru Vaida-Voevod as Premier. The PND, running in elections under a square-in-square logo (回), was rapidly becoming a minor force in Romanian politics. It survived through alliances with the National Liberals or with Averescu, while Argetoianu left it to establish an equally small agrarian group. Iorga concentrated on redacting memoirs, published as \"Supt trei regi\" (\"Under Three Kings\"), whereby he intended to counter political hostility. He also created the Museum of Sacred Art, housed by the Crețulescu Palace.\n\nThe political conflicts were by then reflected in Iorga's academic life: Iorga was becoming strongly opposed to a new generation of professional historians, which included Giurescu the younger, P. P. Panaitescu and Gheorghe Brătianu. At the core, it was a scientific dispute: all three historians, grouped around the new \"Revista Istorică Română\", found Iorga's studies to be speculative, politicized or needlessly didactic in their conclusions. The political discrepancy was highlighted by the more radical support these academics were directing toward King Carol II. In later years, Iorga also feuded with his Transylvanian disciple Lucian Blaga, trying in vain to block Blaga's reception to the Academy over differences in philosophy and literary preference. On Blaga's side, the quarrel involved philologist and civil servant Bazil Munteanu; his correspondence with Blaga features hostile remarks about Iorga's \"vulgarity\" and cultural politics.\n\nOn his way to a pan-European congress, Iorga stirred further controversy by attending, in Rome, the tenth anniversary of the 1922 March, celebrating Italian Fascism. He resumed his participation in conference cycles during 1933, revisiting France, as well as taking back his position at the University of Bucharest; he published another 37 books and, in August 1933, attended the History Congress in Warsaw. His new project was a cultural version of the Polish–Romanian Alliance, working together with poet-diplomat Aron Cotruș to increase awareness of his country, and publishing his own work in the Polish press.\n\nEarly in 1934, Iorga issued a condemnation of the Iron Guard, following the assassination of National Liberal Premier Ion G. Duca by a Legionary death squad. However, during the subsequent police round-ups of Guardist activists, Iorga intervened for the release of fascist philosopher Nae Ionescu, and still invited Guardist poet Radu Gyr to lecture at Vălenii. At the same time, he was again focusing his attention on the condemnation of modernists and the poetry of Arghezi, first with the overview \"Istoria literaturii românești contemporane\" (\"History of Contemporary Romanian Literature\"), then with his press polemics. Also in 1934, Iorga also published a book which coined his image of Romania's early modern culture—\"Byzance après Byzance\" (\"Byzantium after Byzantium\"), alongside the three-volume \"Histoire de la vie byzantine\" (\"A History of Byzantine Life\"). He followed up with a volume of memoirs \"Orizonturile mele. O viață de om așa cum a fost\" (\"My Horizons. The Life of a Man as It Was\"), while inaugurating his contribution to Romania's official cultural magazine, \"Revista Fundațiilor Regale\".\n\nIorga again toured Europe in 1935, and, upon his return to Romania, gave a new set of conferences under the auspices of the Cultural League, inviting scholar Franz Babinger to lecture at the ISSEE. Again in Iași, the historian participated in a special celebration of 18th century Moldavian Prince and Enlightenment thinker Dimitrie Cantemir, whose remains had been retrieved from the Soviet Union to be reburied in the Romanian city. Among the books Iorga published in 1935 are a new version of \"Istoria lui Mihai Viteazul\", alongside \"Originalitatea lui Dimitrie Cantemir\" (\"Dimitrie Cantemir's Originality\"), \"Comemorarea unirii Ardealului\" (\"The Commemoration of Transylvania's Union\") and two volumes of his \"Memorii\" (\"Memoirs\"). His additional essays covered the careers of 17th century intellectuals (Anthim the Iberian, Axinte Uricariul, Constantin Cantacuzino). Also in 1935, Iorga and his daughter Liliana co-authored a Bucharest guide book.\n\nEarly in 1936, Nicolae Iorga was again lecturing at the University of Paris, and gave an additional conference at the \"Société des études historiques\", before hosting the Bucharest session of the International Committee of Historians. He was also in the Netherlands, with a lecture on Byzantine social history: \"L'Homme byzantin\" (\"Byzantine Man\"). Upon his return, wishing to renew his campaign against the modernists, Iorga founded \"Cuget Clar\", the neo-\"Sămănătorist\" magazine.\n\nBy that moment in time, he was publicly voicing his concern that Transylvania was a target of expansion for Regency-period Hungary, while cautioning the public against Nazi Germany and its revanchism. Similarly, he was concerned about the Soviet threat and the fate of Romanians in the Soviet Union, working closely with the Transnistrian anti-communist refugee Nichita Smochină. Such worries were notably expressed by Iorga in a series of Bucharest Radio broadcasts, \"Sfaturi pe întuneric\" (\"Advice at Dark\", soon after published in brochure format). He completed several new volumes, among which were \"Dovezi despre conștiința originii românilor\" (\"Evidence on the Conscious Origin of the Romanians\"), the polemical essay \"Lupta mea contra prostiei\" (\"My Fight against Stupidity\"), and the first two volumes of the long planned \"Istoria românilor\".\n\nNicolae Iorga was officially honored in 1937, when Carol II inaugurated a Bucharest Museum of World History, placed under the ISSEE director's presidency. However, the publicized death threats he received from the Iron Guard eventually prompted Iorga to retire from his university position. He withdrew to Vălenii de Munte, but was still active on the academic scene, lecturing on \"the development of the human spirit\" at the World History Institute, and being received as a corresponding member into Chile's Academy of History. He also mentored German biographer Eugen Wolbe, who collected data on the Romanian kings. This contribution was doubled by a steady participation in the country's political life. Iorga attended the Cultural League congress in Iași, where he openly demanded for the Iron Guard to be outlawed on the grounds that it served Nazi interests, and discussed the threat of war in his speeches at Vălenii de Munte and his Radio conferences. With his \"Neamul Românesc\" disciple N. Georgescu-Cocoș, he was also continuing his fight against modernism, inspiring a special Romanian Academy report on the modernists' \"pornography\".\n\nThe early months of 1938 saw Nicolae Iorga joining the national unity government of Miron Cristea, formed by Carol II's right-wing power base. A Crown Councillor, he then threw his reluctant support behind the National Renaissance Front, created by Carol II as the driving force of a pro-fascist but anti-Guard one-party state (\"see 1938 Constitution of Romania\"). Iorga was upset by the imposition of uniforms on all public officials, calling it \"tyrannical\", and privately ridiculed the new constitutional regime's architects, but he eventually complied to the changes. In April, Iorga was also at the center of a scandal which resulted in Codreanu's arrest and eventual extrajudicial killing. By then, the historian had attacked the Guard's policy of setting up small commercial enterprises and charity ventures. This prompted Codreanu to address him an open letter, which accused Iorga of being dishonest. Premier Armand Călinescu, who had already ordered a clampdown on Guardist activities, seized Iorga's demand for satisfaction as an opportunity, ordering Carol's rival to be tried for libel—the preamble to an extended trial on grounds of conspiracy. An unexpected consequence of this move was the protest resignation of General Ion Antonescu from the office of Defense Minister.\n\nIorga himself refused to attend the trial; in letters he addressed to the judges, he asked the count of libel to be withdrawn, and advised that Codreanu should follow the insanity defense on the other accusations. Iorga's attention then moved to other activities: he was Romanian Commissioner for the 1938 Venice Biennale, and supportive of the effort to establish a Romanian school of genealogists.\n\nIn 1939, as the Guard's campaign of retribution had degenerated into terrorism, Iorga used the Senate tribune to address the issue and demand measures to curb the violence. He was absent for part of the year, again lecturing in Paris. Steadily publishing new volumes of \"Istoria românilor\", he also completed work on several other books: in 1938, \"Întru apărarea graniței de Apus\" (\"For the Defense of the Western Frontier\"), \"Cugetare și faptă germană\" (\"German Thought and Action\"), \"Hotare și spații naționale\" (\"National Borders and Spaces\"); in 1939 \"Istoria Bucureștilor\" (\"History of Bucharest\"), \"Discursuri parlamentare\" (\"Parliamentary Addresses\"), \"Istoria universală văzută prin literatură\" (\"World History as Seen through Literature\"), \"Naționaliști și frontiere\" (\"Nationalists and Frontiers\"), \"Stări sufletești și războaie\" (\"Spiritual States and Wars\"), \"Toate poeziile lui N. Iorga\" (\"N. Iorga's Complete Poetry\") and two new volumes of \"Memorii\". Also in 1938, Iorga inaugurated the open-air theater of Vălenii de Munte with one of his own dramatic texts, \"Răzbunarea pământului\" (\"The Earth's Revenge\"). The total number of titles he presented for publishing in 1939 is 45, including a play about Christina of Sweden (\"Regele Cristina\", \"King C[h]ristina\") and an anti-war cycle of poems. Some of his Anglophile essays were printed by Mihail Fărcășanu in \"Rumanian Quarterly\", which sought to preserve Anglo–Romanian cooperation.\n\nIorga was again Romanian Commissioner of the Venice Biennale in 1940. The accelerated political developments led him to focus on his activities as a militant and journalist. His output for 1940 included a large number of conferences and articles dedicated to the preservation of Greater Romania's borders and the anti-Guardist cause: \"Semnul lui Cain\" (\"The Mark of Cain\"), \"Ignoranța stăpâna lumii\" (\"Ignorance, Mistress of the World\"), \"Drumeț în calea lupilor\" (\"A Wayfarer Facing Wolves\") etc. Iorga was troubled by the outbreak of World War II and saddened by the fall of France, events which formed the basis of his essay \"Amintiri din locurile tragediilor actuale\" (\"Recollections from the Current Scenes of a Tragedy\"). He was also working on a version of \"Prometheus Bound\", a tragedy which probably reflected his concern about Romania, her allies, and the uncertain political future.\n\nThe year 1940 saw the collapse of Carol II's regime. The unexpected cession of Bessarabia to the Soviets shocked Romanian society and greatly angered Iorga. At the two sessions of the Crown Council held on June 27, he was one of six (out of 21) members to reject the Soviet ultimatum demanding Bessarabia's handover, instead calling vehemently for armed resistance. Later, the Nazi-mediated Second Vienna Award made Northern Transylvania a part of Hungary. This loss sparked a political and moral crisis, eventually leading to the establishment of a National Legionary State with Ion Antonescu as \"Conducător\" and the Iron Guard as a governing political force. In the wake of this reshuffling, Iorga decided to close down his \"Neamul Românesc\", explaining: \"When a defeat is registered, the flag is not surrendered, but its fabric is wrapped around the heart. The heart of our struggle was the national cultural idea.\" Perceived as Codreanu's murderer, he received renewed threats from the Iron Guard, including hate mail, attacks in the movement's press (\"Buna Vestire\" and \"Porunca Vremii\") and tirades from the Guardist section in Vălenii. He further antagonized the new government by stating his attachment to the abdicated royal.\n\nNicolae Iorga was forced out of Bucharest (where he owned a new home in Dorobanți quarter) and Vălenii de Munte by the massive earthquake of November. He then moved to Sinaia, where he gave the finishing touches to his book \"Istoriologia umană\" (\"Human Historiology\"). He was kidnapped by a Guardist squad, the best-known member of which was agricultural engineer Traian Boeru, on the afternoon of November 27, and killed in the vicinity of Strejnic (some distance from the city of Ploiești). He was shot at some nine times in all, with 7.65 mm and 6.35 mm handguns. Iorga's killing is often mentioned in tandem with that of agrarian politician Virgil Madgearu, kidnapped and murdered by the Guardists on the same night, and with the Jilava Massacre (during which Carol II's administrative apparatus was decimated). These acts of retribution, placed in connection with the discovery and reburial of Codreanu's remains, were carried out independently by the Guard, and enhanced tensions between it and Antonescu.\n\nIorga's death caused much consternation among the general public, and was received with particular concern by the academic community. Forty-seven universities worldwide flew their flags at half-staff. A funeral speech was delivered by the exiled French historian Henri Focillon, from New York City, calling Iorga \"one of those legendary personalities planted, for eternity, in the soil of a country and the history of human intelligence.\" At home, the Iron Guard banned all public mourning, excepting an obituary in \"Universul\" daily and a ceremony hosted by the Romanian Academy. The final oration was delivered by philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, who noted, in terms akin to those used by Focillon, that the murdered scientist had stood for \"our nation's intellectual prowess\", \"the full cleverness and originality of the Romanian genius\".\n\nIorga's remains were buried at Bellu, in Bucharest, on the same day as Madgearu's funeral—the attendants, who included some of the surviving interwar politicians and foreign diplomats, defied the Guard's ban with their presence. Iorga's last texts, recovered by his young disciple G. Brătescu, were kept by literary critic Șerban Cioculescu and published at a later date. Gheorghe Brătianu later took over Iorga's position at the South-East Europe Institute and the Institute of World History (known as Nicolae Iorga Institute from 1941).\n\nNicolae Iorga's views on society and politics stood at the meeting point of traditional conservatism, ethnic nationalism and national conservatism. This fusion is identified by political scientist Ioan Stanomir as a mutation of \"Junimea\"s ideology, running contrary to Titu Maiorescu's liberal conservatism, but resonating with the ideology of Romania's national poet, Mihai Eminescu. A maverick \"Junimist\", Eminescu added to the conservative vision of his contemporaries an intense nationalism with reactionary, racist and xenophobic tinges, for which he received posthumous attention in Iorga's lifetime. Identified by researcher Ioana Both as a source for the \"Eminescu myth\", Iorga saw in him the poet of \"healthy race\" ideas and the \"integral expression of the Romanian soul\", rather than a melancholy artist. This ideological source shaped the attitudes of many \"Sămănătorists\", eroding \"Junimea\"s influence and redefining Romanian conservatism for the space of one generation. A definition provided by political scientist John Hutchinson lists Iorga among those who embraced \"cultural nationalism\", which rejected modernization, as opposed to \"political nationalism\", which sought to modernize the nation-state.\n\nBorrowing Maiorescu's theory about how Westernization had come to Romania as \"forms without concept\" (meaning that some modern customs had been forced on top of local traditions), Iorga likewise aimed it against the liberal establishment, but gave it a more radical expression. A significant point of continuity between \"Junimism\" and Iorga was the notion of two \"positive\" social classes, both opposed to the bourgeoisie: the lower class, represented by the peasantry, and the aristocratic class of boyars. Like Maiorescu, Iorga attacked the centralizing 1866 Constitution, to which he opposed a statehood based on \"organic\" growth, with self-aware local communities as a source of legitimacy. Also resonating with the \"Junimist\" club was Iorga's vision of the French Revolution—according to French author René Girault, the Romanian was an \"excellent connaisseur\" of this particular era. The revolutionary experience was, in Iorga's view, traumatic, while its liberal or Jacobin inheritors were apostates disturbing the traditional equilibrium. His response to the Jacobin model was an Anglophile and Tocquevillian position, favoring the British constitutional system and praising the American Revolution as the positive example of nation-building.\n\nLike \"Junimism\", Iorga's conservatism did not generally rely on religion. A secularist among the traditionalists, he did not attach a special meaning to Christian ethics, and, praising the creative force of man, saw asceticism as a negative phenomenon. However, he strongly identified the Romanian Orthodox Church and its hesychasm with the Romanian psyche, marginalizing the Latin Rite Church and the Transylvanian School. In rejecting pure individualism, Iorga also reacted against the modern reverence toward Athenian democracy or the Protestant Reformation, giving more positive appraisals to other community models: Sparta, Macedonia, the Italian city-states. As argued by political scientist Mihaela Czobor-Lupp, his was an \"alternative\" to the rationalist perspective, and a counterweight to Max Weber's study on \"The Protestant Ethic\". His theories identified the people as a \"natural entity [with] its own organic life\", and sometimes justified the right of conquest when new civilizations toppled decadent ones—the conflict, he argued, was between Heracles and Trimalchio. In his private and public life, Iorga's conservatism also came with sexist remarks: like Maiorescu, Iorga believed that women only had a talent for nurturing and assisting male protagonists in public affairs.\n\nDespite the various similarities, Iorga and the \"Junimist\" loyalists became political enemies. Early on, Maiorescu would respond to his letters with disdain, while novelist Ioan Slavici called his irredentist projects \"nonsense\". Writing in 1920, \"Convorbiri Critice\" editor Mihail Dragomirescu accused those \"Junimists\" who followed Iorga's \"chauvinist nationalism\" of having forgotten that Maiorescu's art for art's sake principles \"substituted the political criterion of patriotism for the criterion of truth.\" The conflict between Iorga and Dragomirescu was also personal, and, as reported by Iorga's disciple Alexandru Lapedatu, even caused the two to physically assault each other.\n\nIorga's brand of national conservatism was more successful than its more conventional predecessor: while the Conservative Party disappeared from the public eye after 1918, Iorga's more nationalistic interpretation was still considered relevant in the 1930s. One of the last Conservative leaders, Nicolae Filipescu, even pondered forging an alliance with the historian, in an attempt to save the group for dissolution. According to Ioan Stanomir, Iorga and fellow historian Ioan C. Filitti were together responsible for \"the most memorable pages\" in Romanian conservative theory for \"the 1928–1938 decade\". In Stanomir's assessment, this last period of Iorga's activity also implied a move toward the main sources of traditional conservatism, bringing Iorga closer to the line of thought represented by Edmund Burke, Thomas Jefferson or Mihail Kogălniceanu, and away from that of Eminescu.\n\nThe final years brought Iorga's stark condemnation of all etatism, from the absolute monarchy to modern state capitalism, accompanied by a dystopian perspective on industrialization as the end of the individual. Like Eminescu, Iorga was essentially a conservative anti-capitalist and economic corporatist, who confessed his admiration for pre-modern guilds. In Stanomir's account, these ideals, alongside the dreams of a \"ghostly\" organic identity, anti-ideological monarchism and national regeneration, brought Iorga into Carol II's camp. Another factor was the rise of Nazi Germany, which, Iorga thought, could only be met by national unity under a powerful ruler. The realignment came with contradictory statements on Iorga's part, such as when, in 1939, he publicly described Carol's Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen house as having usurped the throne of \"Domnitor\" Alexander John I, statements which enraged monarchist writer Gala Galaction.\n\nIorga found himself in Kogălniceanu's conservative statement, \"civilization stops when revolutions begin\", being especially critical of communist revolution. He described the Soviet experiment as a \"caricature\" of the Jacobin age and communist leader Joseph Stalin as a dangerous usurper. Iorga found the small Romanian Communist Party an amusement and, even though he expressed alarm for its terrorist tendencies and its \"foreign\" nature, disliked the state's use of brutal methods against its members.\n\nA major and controversial component of Iorga's political vision, present throughout most of his career, was his antisemitism. Cultural historian William O. Oldson notes that Iorga's \"amazing list of accomplishments\" in other fields helped give antisemitism \"an irresistible panache\" in Romania, particularly since Iorga shared in the belief that all good nationalists were antisemites. His ideas on the \"Jewish Question\" were frequently supported by violent language, which left traces on his journalist activity (even though, Oldson notes, he did not resort to racial slurs). In 1901, when he blocked Jewish linguist Lazăr Șăineanu from obtaining an academic position, Iorga wrote that Jews had a \"passion for high praise and multiple earnings\"; three years later, in \"Sămănătorul\", he argued that Iași was polluted by the \"dirty business\" of a \"heathen and hostile\" community. Similar accusations were stated, in his travel accounts, where he even justified pogroms against Bukovinan and Bessarabian Jews.\n\nThe PND, coming from the same ideological family as Poland's Roman Dmowski and the National Democracy movement, proclaimed that local Jews were suffocating the Romanian middle class and needed to be expelled, using slogans such as \"Evreii la Palestina\" (\"The Jews to Palestine\"). The program was criticized from early on by Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Iorga's fellow nationalist and post-\"Junimist\", who noted that the economic rationale behind it was unsound. According to Oldson, the claim that Jews were economic \"vampires\" was entirely unsubstantiated, even hypocritical: \"[Iorga was] a Moldavian and fully aware of the complex causes of that province's poverty\".\n\nIorga's personal conservative outlook, passed into the party doctrines, also implied a claim that the Jews were agents of rebellion against political and cultural authority. He had nevertheless opted for religious-cultural over racial antisemitism, believing that, at the core of civilization, there was a conflict between Christian values and Judaism. He also suggested that Romanian antisemitism was conjectural and defensive, segregationist rather than destructive, and repeatedly argued that xenophobia was not in the national character—ideas paraphrased by Oldson as a \"humane antisemitism\". Oldson also refers to a paradox in the attitude of Iorga (and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu before him): \"A self-consciously proclaimed esteem for a minuscule [Jewish] elite, then, went hand in hand with the utmost contempt and condescension for the bulk of Romanian Jewry.\"\n\nReviewing the impact of such ideas, literary critic William Totok referred to \"Neamul Românesc\" as \"the most important platform of antisemitic agitation prior to World War I.\" Habitually, the magazine attacked the Jewish-owned papers \"Adevărul\" and \"Dimineața\", while claiming to document the \"Judaization\" of Romania's intellectual environments. It also specifically targeted Romanians who were friendly with Jews, one such case being that of writer Ion Luca Caragiale (attacked for his contacts with Șăineanu, dramatist Ronetti Roman and other Jews). Caragiale replied with noted irony, calling Iorga \"tall but crooked\".\n\nNicolae Iorga and A. C. Cuza's modern revival of antisemitism, together with the core themes of \"Sămănătorul\" propaganda, were paradoxical sources of inspiration for the Iron Guard in its early years. However, with the interwar period came a relaxation of Iorga's own antisemitic discourse, when he described Jews as potentially loyal to \"the legitimate masters of the land\". He recorded being touched by his warm reception among the Romanian American Jewish community in 1930, and, after 1934, published his work with the \"Adevărul\" group. As Cuza himself began censuring this more tolerant discourse, Iorga even voiced his admiration for the Jewish mecena Aristide Blank. As noted by researcher George Voicu, the anti-\"Judaization\" discourse of the far right was by then turning against Iorga. Later in life, Iorga made the occasional return to antisemitic rhetoric: in 1937–1938, he alleged that Jews were pressuring Romanians into leaving the country, and described the necessity of \"delousing\" Romania by colonizing Romanian Jews elsewhere.\n\nIorga's changing sentiment flowed between the extremes of Francophilia and Francophobia. The Romanian scholar explained in detail his dislike for the Third Republic's social and political landscape. He recalled that, in the 1890s, he had been shocked by the irreverence and cosmopolitanism of French student society. In a 1906 speech, Iorga also noted that Francophone elites and urban diglossia were slowly destroying the country's social fiber, by creating a language gap between classes. Also, \"Neamul Românesc\" showed a preference for \"Action Française\" and the French reactionary right in their conflict with the Third Republic. Shortly after the beginning of World War I, during the Battle of the Frontiers, Iorga publicized his renewed love for France, claiming that she was the only belligerent engaged in a purely defensive war; in the name of Pan-Latinism, he later chided Spain for keeping neutral.\n\nIorga's coverage of European culture and continental affairs also opened bridges with other cultural areas, particularly so during the interwar. By that time, historian Lucian Boia notes, he was seeing Europe as a community of nations, and, \"in his own way\", was rejecting isolationism or \"primitive\" xenophobia. According to academic Francesco Guida, Iorga's political and scholarly activities displayed a \"great openness towards the outside world\", even as, in 1930s France, public opinion was turning against him. Instead, Iorga affirmed himself as a promoter of English culture, making noted efforts at promoting awareness of its defining traits among the Romanian public. At the time, although flirting with Pan-European nationalism, he stood in contrast with the Transylvanian-born Iuliu Maniu for displaying no sympathy toward Danubian Confederation projects, believing them to conceal Hungary's revanchism.\n\nDisenchanted with German culture after the shock of World War I, Iorga also had strong views on Adolf Hitler, Nazi Germany and Nazism in general, taking in view their contempt for the Versailles system, but also their repressive politics. He summarized this in \"Sfaturi pe întuneric\": \"Beware my people for great dangers are stalking you ... Borders are attacked, gutted, destroyed, gulped up. ... There reemerges, in its cruelest form, the old theory that small states have no right to independence, that they fall within living spaces ... I cannot forget the past and I cannot reach an agreement with Hitler's dictatorship, being a man who cherishes freedom of thought\". He later called Germany's Bohemia Protectorate a \"Behemoth\", referring to its annexation as a \"prehistoric\" act.\n\nHis anti-war texts of 1939 replied to claims that a new armed conflict would usher in national \"vitality\", and, during the September Campaign, expressed solidarity with Poland—Iorga's Polonophila was even noted by the Nazis, causing more frictions between Berlin and Bucharest. The conservative Iorga was however inclined to sympathize with other forms of totalitarianism or corporatism, and, since the 1920s, viewed Italian Fascism with some respect. Italian agents of influence hesitated between Iorga and the Iron Guard, but the Fascist International sought to include Iorga among its Romanian patrons; Iorga himself expressed regret that the Italian regime was primarily an ally of revanchist Hungary, but applauded the 1935 invasion of Ethiopia, and, to the alarm of France, repeatedly argued that an Italian alliance was more secure than the Little Entente.\n\nNicolae Iorga's bitterness about Romanian geopolitical disadvantages was encoded in his oft-quoted remark about the country only having two peaceful borders: one with Serbia, the other with the Black Sea. Despite these views, he endorsed the idea of minority rights in Greater Romania, attempting to find common ground with the Hungarian-Romanian community. In addition to promoting inclusive action in government, Iorga declared himself against turning Hungarians and Transylvanian Saxons into \"pharisaic\" Romanians by coercing them to adopt the Romanian tradition. In 1936, he even spoke in favor of Armenian Hungarian archeologist Márton Roska, prosecuted in Romania for challenging official theses about Transylvania, arguing that Transylvania \"cannot be defended with prison sentences\". Iorga was also noted for fostering the academic career of Eufrosina Dvoichenko-Markov, one of the few Russian-Romanian researchers of the interwar period. He was however skeptical about the Ukrainian identity and rejected the idea of an independent Ukraine on Romania's border, debating the issues with ethnographer Zamfir Arbore.\n\nVarious of Iorga's tracts speak in favor of a common background uniting the diverse nations of the Balkans. Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova suggests that, unlike many of his predecessors, Iorga was not alarmed Romania being perceived as a Balkan country, and did not attach a negative connotation to this affiliation (even though, she notes, Iorga explicitly placed the northern limit of the Balkans on the Danube, just south of Wallachia). In the 1930s, the Romanian scholar spoke with respect about all the Balkan peoples, but claimed that Balkan statehood was \"Oriental\" and underdeveloped.\n\nIorga the European scholar has drawn comparisons with figures such as Voltaire, Jules Michelet, Leopold von Ranke and Claudio Sánchez-Albornoz. Having achieved fluency in some 12 foreign languages, he was an exceptionally prolific author: according to his biographer Barbu Theodorescu, the total of his published contributions, both volumes and brochures, was 1,359. His work in documenting Romania's historical past could reach an unprecedented intensity, one such exceptional moment being a 1903 study trip to Târgu Jiu, a three-day interval during which he copied and summarized 320 individual documents, covering the period 1501–1833. His mentor and rival Xenopol was among the first voices to discuss his genius, his 1911 Academy speech in honor of Nicolae Iorga making special note of his \"absolutely extraordinary memory\" and his creative energy, and concluding: \"one asks himself in wonder how a brain was able to conceive of so many things and a hand was able to record them\". In 1940, Rădulescu-Motru likewise argued that Iorga had been \"a creator ... of unparalleled fecundity\", while \"Enciclopedia Cugetarea\" deemed him the greatest-ever mind in Romania. According to literary historian George Călinescu, Iorga's \"huge\" and \"monstrously\" comprehensive research, leaving no other historian \"the joy of adding something\", was matched by the everyday persona, a \"hero of the ages\".\n\nThe level of Iorga's productivity and the quality of his historical writing were also highlighted by more modern researchers. Literary historian Ovid Crohmălniceanu opined that Iorga's scientific work was one of the \"illustrious accomplishments\" of the interwar years, on par with Constantin Brâncuși's sculptures and George Enescu's music. Romanian historian of culture Alexandru Zub finds that Iorga's is \"surely the richest opus coming from the 20th century\", while Maria Todorova calls Iorga \"Romania's greatest historian\", adding \"at least in terms of the size of his opus and his influence both at home and abroad\". According to philosopher Liviu Bordaș, Iorga's main topic of interest, the relation between Romania and the Eastern world, was exhaustively covered: \"nothing escaped this sacred monster's attention: Iorga had read everything.\"\n\nThe definition of history followed by Iorga was specified in his 1894 \"Despre concepția actuală a istoriei și geneza ei\": \"History is the systematic exposition, free from all unrelated purpose, of facts irrespective of their nature, methodically acquired, through which human activity manifested itself, irrespective of place and time.\" With Ioan Bogdan and Dimitrie Onciul, young Iorga was considered an exponent of the \"new\" or \"critical\" school, with which \"Junimism\" tackled Romantic nationalism in the name of objectivity. However, even at that stage, Iorga's ideas accommodated a belief that history needed to be written with a \"poetic talent\" that would make one \"relive\" the past.\n\nBy 1902, he had changed his approach in historiography to include and illustrate his belief in emotional attachment as a positive value of cultural nationalism. He would speak of historians as \"elders of [their] nation\", and dismissed academic specialization as a \"blindfold\". Reflecting back on the transition, Iorga himself stated: \"The love for the past, for great figures of energy and sincerity, ... the exact contrary of tendencies I had found existed among my contemporaries, had gripped me and, added to my political preoccupations, such awakenings served me, when it came to criticizing things present, more than any argument that is abstract, logical in nature.\" The point of his research, Iorga explained in 1922, was to show \"the nation itself as a living being\". According to literary historian Victor Iova: \"[Iorga's] overall activity ... did not just seek the communication of knowledge, but also expressly sought to define the social finality of his time, its ethical sense and his own patriotic ideal.\" The 1911 speech \"Două concepții istorice\" nevertheless provided a more nuanced outline, cautioning against a potential cult of heroes and suggesting that national histories were inextricably linked to each other: \"The life of a people is at all times mingled with the lives of others, existing in relation with these and at all times feeding into the others' lives.\"\n\nAccording to George Călinescu, Nicolae Iorga was overdependent on his memory, which could result in \"utterly fictitious\" critical apparatuses for his scientific works. Călinescu suggests that Iorga was an \"anachronistic\" type in his context: \"approved only by failures\", aged before his time, modeling himself on ancient chroniclers and out of place in modern historiography. In the 1930s, Iorga's status in regulating the official historical narrative was challenged by Constantin C. Giurescu, P. P. Panaitescu and Gheorghe Brătianu, who wanted to return academic discourse back to the basic \"Junimist\" caveats, and were seen by Iorga as \"denialists\". For all the controversy, Lucian Boia suggests, neither of the \"Revista Istorică Română\" publishers was completely beyond Iorga's subjectivity, pathos or political bias, even though Panaitescu was for long \"closer\" to the \"Junimist\" model. A particular challenge to Iorga's historical narrative also came from rival Hungarian historiography: in 1929, Benedek Jancsó called Iorga's science a branch of \"Romanian imperialist nationalism\", his argument rejected as \"false logic\" by the Romanian. Iorga had a friendly attitude toward other Hungarian scholars, including Árpád Bitay and Imre Kádár, who were his guests at Vălenii.\n\nSeveral other historians have expressed criticism of Iorga's bias and agenda. R. W. Seton-Watson regarded him as \"prolific\" and \"\", but mentioned his \"slovenly style\". In 1945, Hugh Seton-Watson spoke of the \"great Roumanian Professor\" having contributed \"erudite chronology, written in a highly romantic and bombastic spirit.\" In his own \"Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time\", Iorga's German colleague Franz Babinger also noted that Iorga could get \"carried away by national pride\". Medievalist Kenneth Setton also described Iorga as \"the great Rumanian historian ... who was sometimes intoxicated by the grandeur of his own historical concepts, but whose work is always illuminating.\" While Japanese sociologist Kosaku Yoshino sees Iorga as a main contributor to didactic and dramatized cultural nationalism in Europe, University of Trento academic Paul Blokker suggests that, although \"politicized, essentialist and sometimes anachronistic\", Iorga's writings can be critically recovered. Ioana Both notes: \"A creator with titan-like forces, Iorga is more a visionary of history than a historian\". Bordaș criticizes Iorga's habit of recording \"everything\" into his studies, and without arranging the facts described into an \"epistemological relationship\".\n\nDespite Iorga's ambition of fusing research and pedagogy, his students, both rivals and friends, often noted that he was inferior to other colleagues when it came to teaching, in particular in directing advanced classes—reportedly, his popularity dropped with time, the aging Iorga having displayed aggression toward inquisitive students. In 1923, even an old friend like Sextil Pușcariu could accuse Iorga of behaving like a \"dictator\". In compensation, the historian fulfilled this function with his activity in the media and in the field of popular history, at which he was, according to historian Lucian Nastasă, masterful but vulgarizing.\n\nIorga's ideas on the origin of the Romanians, and his explanation for the more mysterious parts of that lengthy ethnogenesis process, were shaped by his both his scientific and ideological preoccupations. Some of Iorga's studies focused specifically on the original events in the process: ancient Dacia's conquest by the Roman Empire (Trajan's Dacian Wars), and the subsequent foundation of Roman Dacia. His account is decidedly in support of Romania's Roman (Latin) roots, and even suggests that Romanization preceded the actual conquest. However, he viewed the autochthonous element in this acculturation, the Dacians (collocated by him with the Getae), as historically significant, and he even considered them the source for Romania's later links with the Balkan \"Thracian\" space. Through the Thracians and the Illyrians, Iorga believed to have found a common root for all Balkan peoples, and an ethnic layer which he believed was still observable after later conquests. He was nevertheless explicit in distancing himself from the speculative texts of Dacianist Nicolae Densușianu, where Dacia was described as the source of all European civilization.\n\nIorga had a complex personal perspective on the little-documented Dark Age history, between the Roman departure (271 AD) and the 14th century emergence of two Danubian Principalities: Moldavia and Wallachia. Despite the separate histories and conflicting allegiances these regions had during the High Middle Ages, he tended to group the two Principalities and medieval Transylvania together, into a vague non-stately entity he named \"the Romanian Land\". Iorga cautioned about the emergence of states from a stateless society such as the proto-Romanian one: \"The state is a late, very elevated, very delicate form that, under certain conditions, may be reached by a people. ... There was therefore no state, but a Romanian mass living in the midst of forests, in those villages harbored by protective forests, where it is just as true that a certain way of life could emerge, sometimes on a rather elevated level.\"\n\nEchoing his political conservatism, Iorga's theory proposed that the Romanized Dacians, or all their Vlach-Romanian successors, had created peasant republics to defend themselves against the invading nomads. It spoke of the rapid ruralization of Latin urban dwellers—suggested to him by etymologies such as the derivation of \"pământ\" (\"soil\") from \"pavimentum\", and the creation of \"genealogical villages\" around common ancestors (\"moși\") or the ancient communal sharing of village lands, in the manner imagined by writer Nicolae Bălcescu. Iorga also supposed that, during the 12th century, there was an additional symbiosis between settled Vlachs and their conquerors, the nomadic Cumans.\n\nIorga's peasant polities, sometimes described by him as \"Romanii populare\" (\"people's Romanias\", \"people's Roman-like polities\"), were seen by him as the sources of a supposed uncodified constitution in both Moldavia and Wallachia. That constitutional system, he argued, created solidarity: the countries' \"hospodar\" rulers were themselves peasants, elected to high military office by their peers, and protecting the entire community. Unlike Ioan Bogdan and others, Iorga strongly rejected any notion that the South Slavs had been an additional contributor to ethnogenesis, and argued that Slavic idioms were a sustained but nonessential influence in historical Romanian. Until 1919, he was cautious about counting the Romanians and Aromanians as one large ethnic group, but later came to share the inclusivist views of his Romanian colleagues. Iorga also stood out among his generation for flatly rejecting any notion that the 12th-century Second Bulgarian Empire was a \"Vlach-Bulgarian\" or \"Romanian-Bulgarian\" project, noting that the Vlach achievements there benefited \"another nation\" (Iorga's italics).\n\nThe stately foundation of Moldavia and of Wallachia, Iorga thought, were linked to the emergence of major trade routes in the 14th century, and not to the political initiative of military elites. Likewise, Iorga looked into the genesis of boyardom, describing the selective progression of free peasants into a local aristocracy. He described the later violent clash between \"hospodars\" and boyars as one between national interest and disruptive centrifugal tendencies, suggesting that prosperous boyardom had undermined the balance of the peasant state. His theory about the peasant nature of Romanian statehood was hotly debated in his lifetime, particularly after a 1920 discovery showed that Radu I of Wallachia had been buried in the full regalia of medieval lords. Another one of his influential (but disputed) claims attributed the appearance of pre-modern slavery, mainly affecting the Romani (Gypsy) minority, exclusively on alien customs borrowed from the Mongol Empire. Iorga's verdicts as a medievalist also produced a long-standing controversy about the real location of the 1330 Battle of Posada—so-named by him after an obscure reference in the \"Chronicon Pictum\"—whereby the Wallachian Princes secured their throne.\n\nA major point of contention between Panaitescu and Iorga referred to Michael the Brave's historical achievements: sacrilegious in the eyes of Iorga, Panaitescu placed in doubt Michael's claim to princely descent, and described him as mainly the political agent of boyar interests. Contradicting the Romantic nationalist tradition, Iorga also agreed with younger historians that, for most of their history, Romanians in Moldavia, Wallachia and Transylvania were more justifiably attached to their polities than to national awakening ideals. Panaitescu was however more categorical than Iorga in affirming that Michael the Brave's expeditions were motivated by political opportunism rather than by a pan-Romanian national awareness.\n\nTwo of Iorga's major fields of expertise were Byzantine studies and Turkology. A significant portion of his contributions in the field detailed the impact of Byzantine influences on the Danubian Principalities and the Balkans at large. He described the \"Byzantine man\" as embodying the blend of several cultural universes: Greco-Roman, Levantine and Eastern Christian. In this context, Iorga was also exploring Romania's own identity issues as a confluence of Byzantine Eastern Orthodoxy and a Western Roman linguistic imprint.\n\nIorga's writings insisted on the importance of Byzantine Greek and Levantine influences in the two countries after the fall of Constantinople: his notion of \"Byzantium after Byzantium\" postulated that the cultural forms produced by the Byzantine Empire had been preserved by the Principalities under Ottoman suzerainty (roughly, between the 16th and 18th centuries). Additionally, the Romanian scholar described the Ottoman Empire itself as the inheritor of Byzantine government, legal culture and civilization, up to the Age of Revolution. However, the \"Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches\" postulated that the Ottoman decline was irreversible, citing uncompromising Islam as one of the causes, and playing down the cohesive action of Ottomanism.\n\nThe post-Byzantine thesis was taken by various commentators as further proof that the Romanian historian, unlike many of his contemporaries, accepted a level of multiculturalism or acculturation in defining modern Romanian identity. Semiotician Monica Spiridon writes: \"Iorga highly valued the idea of cultural confluence and hybridity.\" Similarly, Maria Todorova notes that, although it minimized the Ottoman contribution and displayed \"emotional or evaluative overtones\", such a perspective ran against the divisive interpretations of the Balkans, offering a working paradigm for a global history of the region: \"Although Iorga's theory may be today [ca. 2009] no more than an exotic episode in the development of Balkan historiography, his formulation \"Byzance après Byzance\" is alive not only because it was a fortunate phrase but because it reflects more than its creator would intimate. It is a good descriptive term, particularly for representing the commonalities of the Orthodox peoples in the Ottoman Empire ... but also in emphasizing the continuity of two imperial traditions\". With his research, Iorga also rehabilitated the Phanariotes, Greek or Hellenized aristocrats who controlled Wallachia and Moldavia in Ottoman times, and whom Romanian historiography before him presented as wreckers of the country.\n\nIorga's tolerance for the national bias in historiography and his own political profile were complemented in the field of literature and the arts by his strong belief in didacticism. Art's mission was, in his view, to educate and empower the Romanian peasant. The rejection of art for art's sake, whose indifference in front of nationality issues enraged the historian, was notably illustrated by his 1902 letter to the like-minded \"Luceafărul\" editors, which stated: \"You gentlemen should not allow aesthetic preoccupations to play the decisive part, and you are not granted such circumstances as to dedicate yourselves to pure art. ... Do not imitate ..., do not allow yourselves to be tempted by things you have read elsewhere. Write about things from your country and about the Romanian soul therein.\" His ambition was to contribute an alternative to \"Junimist\" literary history, and, according to comparatist John Neubauer, for the first time integrate \"the various Romanian texts and writers into a grand narrative of an organic and spontaneous growth of native creativity, based on local tradition and folklore.\" Iorga described painter Nicolae Grigorescu as the purveyor of national pride, and was enthusiastic about Stoica D., the war artist. He recommended artists to study handicrafts, even though, an adversary of the pastiche, he strongly objected to Brâncovenesc revival style taken up by his generation. His own monographs on Romanian art and folklore, admired in their time by art historian Gheorghe Oprescu, were later rated by ethologist Romulus Vulcănescu a sample of microhistory, rather than a groundbreaking new research.\n\nInitially, with \"Opinions sincères\", Iorga offered a historian's manifesto against the whole cultural establishment, likened by historian Ovidiu Pecican with Allan Bloom's 1980s critique of American culture. Before 1914, Iorga focused his critical attention on Romanian Symbolists, whom he denounced for their erotic style (called \"\"lupanarium\" literature\" by Iorga) and aestheticism—in one instance, he even scolded \"Sămănătorul\" contributor Dimitrie Anghel for his floral-themed Symbolist poems. His own theses were ridiculed early in the 20th century by Symbolists such as Emil Isac, Ovid Densusianu or Ion Minulescu, and toned down by \"Sămănătorul\" poet Ștefan Octavian Iosif.\nAfter his own Marxist beginnings, Iorga was also a critic of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea's socialist and Poporanist school, and treated its literature with noted disdain. In reply, Russian Marxist journalist Leon Trotsky accused him of wishing to bury all left-wing contributions to culture, and local socialist Henric Sanielevici wrote that Iorga's literary doctrine did not live up to its moral goals. Iorga wrote with noted warmth about \"Contemporanul\" and its cultural agenda, but concluded that Poporanists represented merely \"the left-wing current of the National Liberal Party\".\n\nIorga's direct influence as a critic had largely faded by the 1920s, owing in part to his decision of concentrating his energy elsewhere. Nevertheless, he was still often involved at the forefront of cultural campaigns against the various manifestations of modernism, initiating polemics with all the circles representing Romania's new literary and artistic trends: the moderate \"Sburătorul\" review of literary theorist Eugen Lovinescu; the eclectic \"Contimporanul\" magazine; the Expressionist cell affiliated with the traditionalist magazine \"Gândirea\"; and ultimately the various local branches of Dada or Surrealism. In some of his essays, Iorga identified Expressionism with the danger of Germanization, a phenomenon he described as \"intolerable\" (although, unwittingly, he was also among the first Romanians to tackle Expressionism). In an analogy present in a 1922 article for \"Gazeta Transilvaniei\", Iorga suggested that the same \"German\" threat was agitating the avant-garde voices of Latin Europe, Futurists and Dadaist \"energumens\" alike. During the 1930s, as the cultural and political climate changed, Iorga's main accusation against Tudor Arghezi, Lucian Blaga, Mircea Eliade, Liviu Rebreanu, George Mihail Zamfirescu and other Romanian modernists was their supposed practice of literary \"pornography\".\n\nThe ensuing polemics were often bitter, and Iorga's vehemence was met with ridicule by his modernist adversaries. \"Sburătorul\" literary chronicler Felix Aderca saw in Iorga the driver of \"the boorish carts of \"Sămănătorism\"\", and Blaga called him \"the collective name for a multitude of monsters\". Iorga's stance on \"pornography\" only attracted provocation from the younger avant-garde writers. In the early 1930s, the avant-garde youth put out the licentious art magazine \"Alge\" sent him a copy for review; prosecuted on Iorga's orders, they all later became noted as left-wing authors and artists: Aurel Baranga, Gherasim Luca, Paul Păun, Jules Perahim.\n\nA lengthy polemic consumed Iorga's relationship with Lovinescu, having at its core the irreconcilable differences between their visions of cultural history. Initially an Iorga aficionado and an admirer of his attack on foreign influences, the \"Sburătorul\" leader left sarcastic comments on Iorga's rejection of Symbolism, and, according to Crohmălniceanu, \"entire pages of ironies targeting Iorga's advice to writers that they should focus of the sufferings of their 'brother' in the village\". Lovinescu also ridiculed Iorga's traditionalist mentoring, calling him a \"pontiff of indecency and insult\", an enemy of \"democratic freedom\", and the patron of forgettable \"literature about hajduks\".\n\nOther authors back Lovinescu's verdict about the historian's lack of critical intuition and prowess. According to Călinescu, Iorga was visibly embarrassed by even 19th century Romanticism, out of his territory with virtually everything after \"Villani and Commynes\", and endorsing the \"obscure manqués\" in modern Romanian letters. Alexandru George only supports in part this verdict, noting that Iorga's literary histories degenerated from \"masterpiece\" to \"gravest mistake\". An entire category of minor, largely forgotten, writers was endorsed by Iorga, among them Vasile Pop, Ecaterina Pitiș, Constantin T. Stoika and Sandu Teleajen.\n\nIorga's views were in part responsible for a split taking place at \"Gândirea\", occurring when his traditionalist disciple, Nichifor Crainic, became the group's new leader and marginalized the Expressionists. Crainic, who was also a poet with \"Sămănătorist\" tastes, was held in esteem by Iorga, whose publications described him and his disciples as the better half of \"Gândirea\". Iorga was also the subject of a \"Gândirea\" special issue, being recognized as a forerunner (a title he shared with Octavian Goga and Vasile Pârvan). There was however a major incompatibility between the two traditionalist tendencies: to Iorga's secularism, Crainic opposed a quasi-theocratic vision, based on the Romanian Orthodox Church as a guarantee of Romanian identity. Crainic saw his own theory as an afterthought of \"Sămănătorism\", arguing that his \"Gândirism\" had erected an \"azure tarpaulin\", symbolizing the Church, over Iorga's nationalism.\n\nIn particular, his ideas on the Byzantine connections and organic development of Romanian civilization were welcomed by both the \"Gândirists\" and some representatives of more conventional modernism. One such figure, affiliated with \"Contimporanul\", was essayist Benjamin Fondane. His views on the bridging of tradition with modernism quoted profusely from Iorga's arguments against cultural imitation, but parted with Iorga's various other beliefs. According to Călinescu, the \"philosopher-myths\" (Iorga and Pârvan) also shaped the anti-\"Junimist\" outlook of the 1930s \"Trăirists\", who returned to ethnic nationalism and looked favorably on the Dacian layer of Romanian identity. Iorga's formative influence on \"Trăirists\" such as Eliade and Emil Cioran was also highlighted by some other researchers. In 1930s Bessarabia, Iorga's ideology helped influence poet Nicolai Costenco, who created \"Viața Basarabiei\" as a local answer to \"Cuget Clar\".\n\nAccording to some of his contemporaries, Nicolae Iorga was an outstandingly talented public speaker. One voice in support of this view is that of Ion Petrovici, a \"Junimist\" academic, who recounted that hearing Iorga lecture had made him overcome a prejudice which rated Maiorescu above all Romanian orators. In 1931, critic Tudor Vianu found that Iorga's \"great oratorical skill\" and \"volcanic nature\" complimented a passion for the major historical phenomena. A decade later, George Călinescu described in detail the historian's public speaking routine: the \"zmeu\"-like introductory outbursts, the episodes of \"idle grace\", the apparent worries, the occasional anger and the intimate, calm, addresses to his bewildered audience.\n\nThe oratorical technique flowed into Iorga's contribution to \"belles-lettres\". The antiquated polished style, Călinescu notes, even surfaced in his works of research, which revived the picturesque tone of medieval chronicles. Tudor Vianu believed it \"amazing\" that, even in 1894, Iorga had made \"so rich a synthesis of the scholarly, literary and oratorical formulas\". Critic Ion Simuț suggests that Iorga is at his best in travel writing, combining historical fresco and picturesque detail. The travel writer in young Iorga blended with the essayist and, occasionally, the philosopher, although, as Vianu suggests, the \"Cugetări\" aphorisms were literary exercises rather than \"philosophical system.\" In fact, Iorga's various reflections attack the core tenets of philosophy, and describe the philosopher prototype as detached from reality, intolerant of others, and speculative.\n\nIorga was a highly productive dramatist, inspired by the works of Carlo Goldoni, William Shakespeare, Pierre Corneille and the Romanian Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea. According to critic Ion Negoițescu, he was at home in the genre, which complimented his vision of \"history as theater\". Other authors are more reserved about Iorga's value for this field: noting that Negoițescu's verdict is an isolated opinion, Simuț considers the plays' rhetorical monologues \"hardly bearable\". Literary historian Nicolae Manolescu found some of the texts in question illegible, but argued: \"It is inconceivable that Iorga's theater is entirely obsolete\". Of the twenty-some plays, including many verse works, most are in the historical drama genre. Manolescu, who argues that \"the best\" of them have a medieval setting, writes that \"Constantin Brâncoveanu\", \"Un domn pribeag\" and \"Cantemir bătrânul\" are \"without any interest\". Iorga's other work for the stage also includes the \"five-act fairy tale\" \"Frumoasa fără trup\" (\"Bodyless Beauty\"), which repeats a motif found in Romanian folklore, and a play about Jesus Christ (where Jesus is not shown, but heard).\n\nIorga's poems include odes to Poland, written shortly after the 1939 German invasion, described by author Nicolae Mareș as \"unparalleled in any other literature\". Overall, however, Iorga as poet has enlisted negative characterizations, rated by Simuț as \"uninteresting and obsolete\". Among Iorga's other contributions are translations from foreign writers: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Kostis Palamas, Goldoni etc. A special target for his interest was English literature, whom he believed had a \"fundamental bond\" with Romanian lore, as traditions equally \"steeped in mystery.\" In addition to translating from Marie of Edinburgh, Iorga authored versions of poems by William Butler Yeats (\"Aedh Wishes for the Cloths of Heaven\", \"When You Are Old\").\n\nIn old age, Iorga had also established his reputation as a memoirist: \"Orizonturile mele\" was described by Victor Iova as \"a masterpiece of Romanian literature\". George Călinescu referred to this series as Iorga's \"interesting\" and \"eminently subjective\" literature; \"dignified\" and dominated by \"explosions of sentiment\", it echoes, according to Călinescu, the Renaissance model of Ion Neculce. Many of the volumes were quickly written as Iorga's attempt to rehabilitate himself after a failed premiership; \"Orizonturile\" comprises messages on the power and justness of his cause: \"And so I stand at age sixty-two, confident and strong, proud, upright in front of my conscience and the judgment of time.\" The works offer retrospective arguments against Iorga's adversaries and sketch portraits of people who crossed Iorga's path—attributes which, Iova suggests, fully exploit Iorga's talents as a \"polemicist\" and \"portraitist\"; according to Alexandru Zub, they also fall into place within the Romanian ego-history vogue, between Xenopol's and Pârvan's.\n\nBoth the diaries and the memoirs are noted for their caustic and succinct portraits of Iorga's main rivals: Maiorescu as inflexible and unemotional, Dimitrie Sturdza as avaricious, Nae Ionescu as \"an awful temper\", Hungarian politician István Tisza as a \"Turanian\" tyrant; Iorga contributed particularly emotional, and critically acclaimed, tributes for his political friends, from Vasile Bogrea to Yugoslavia's Nikola Pašić. \"Supt trei regi\" abunds in positive and negative portrayals, but, Călinescu notes, it fails to show Iorga as politically astute: \"he gives the impression that he knows no more [of the events] than the man of the street.\"\n\nAt times, Iorga sheds a nostalgic light on his one-time opponents (similar, in Călinescu's view, to \"inscriptions on their graves\"). Notably in this context, Iorga reserved praise for some who had supported the Central Powers (Carol I, Virgil Arion, George Coșbuc, Dimitrie Onciul), but also stated that actual collaboration with the enemy was unforgivable. His obituary piece of socialist activist I. C. Frimu, part of \"Oameni cari au fost\", was so sympathetic that the authorities had to censor it.\n\nThe fields of scientific inquiry opened by Iorga, in particular his study into the origin of the Romanians, were taken up after his death by other researchers: Gheorghe Brătianu, Constantin C. Giurescu, P. P. Panaitescu, Șerban Papacostea, Henri H. Stahl. As cultural historian, Iorga found a follower in N. Cartojan, while his thoughts on the characteristics of Romanianness inspired the social psychology of Dimitrie Drăghicescu. In the postmodern age, Iorga's pronouncements on the subject arguably contributed to the birth of Romanian imagological, post-colonial and cross-cultural studies. The idea of \"Romanii populare\" has endured as a popular working hypothesis in Romanian archeology.\n\nAside from being himself a writer, Iorga's public image was also preserved in the literary work of both his colleagues and adversaries. One early example is a biting epigram by Ion Luca Caragiale, where Iorga is described as the dazed savant. In addition to the many autobiographies which discuss him, he is a hero in various works of fiction. As geographer Cristophor Arghir, he is the subject of a thinly disguised portrayal in the \"Bildungsroman\" \"În preajma revoluței\" (\"Around the Time of the Revolution\"), written by his rival Constantin Stere in the 1930s. Celebrated Romanian satirist and \"Viața Românească\" affiliate Păstorel Teodoreanu was engaged in a lengthy polemic with Iorga, enshrining Iorga in Romanian humor as a person with little literary skill and an oversized ego, and making him the subject of an entire collection of poems and articles, \"Strofe cu pelin de mai pentru Iorga Neculai\" (\"Stanzas in May Wormwood for Iorga Neculai\"). One of Teodoreanu's own epigrams in \"Contimporanul\" ridiculed \"Moartea lui Dante\", showing the resurrected Dante Aligheri pleading with Iorga to be left in peace. Iorga was also identified as the subject of fictional portrayals in a modernist novel by N. D. Cocea and (against the author's disclaimer) in George Ciprian's play \"The Drake's Head\".\n\nIorga became the subject of numerous visual portrayals. Some of the earliest were satires, such as an 1899 portrait of him as a Don Quixote (the work of Nicolae Petrescu Găină) and images of him as a ridiculously oversized character, in Ary Murnu's drawings for \"Furnica\" review. Later, Iorga's appearance inspired the works of some other visual artists, including his own daughter Magdalina (Magda) Iorga, painter Constantin Piliuță and sculptor Ion Irimescu, who was personally acquainted with the scholar. Irimescu's busts of Iorga are located in places of cultural importance: the ISSEE building in Bucharest and a public square in Chișinău, Moldova (ex-Soviet Bessarabia). The city has another Iorga bust, the work of Mihail Ecobici, in the \"Aleea Clasicilor\" complex. Since 1994, Iorga's face is featured on a highly circulated Romanian leu bill: the 10,000 lei banknote, which became the 1 leu bill following a 2005 monetary reform.\n\nSeveral Romanian cities have \"Nicolae Ioga\" streets or boulevards: Bucharest (also home of the Iorga High School and the Iorga Park), Botoșani, Brașov, Cluj-Napoca, Constanța, Craiova, Iași, Oradea, Ploiești, Sibiu, Timișoara, etc. In Moldova, his name was also assigned to similar locations in Chișinău and Bălți. The Botoșani family home, restored and partly rebuilt in 1965, is currently preserved as a Memorial House. The house in Vălenii is a memorial museum.\n\nIorga's murder, like other acts of violence ordered by the Iron Guard, alarmed Ion Antonescu, who found that it contradicted his resolutions on public order—the first clash in a dispute which, early in 1941, erupted as the Legionary Rebellion and saw the Guard's ouster from power. Reportedly, Iorga's murder instantly repelled some known supporters of the Guard, such as Radu Gyr and Mircea Eliade. Responding to condemnation of his actions from his place of exile in Francoist Spain, the Guard leader Horia Sima claimed to have played no part in the killing. Sima stated that he did not regret the act, noting that Iorga the scholar had had a long enough career, and arguing, counterfactually, that the revenge was saluted by most Romanians.\n\nRomania's communist regime, set up in the late 1940s, originally revised Iorga's role in the historical narrative: a record 214 works of his were banned by communist censors, and remained banned until 1965. From 1948, the Nicolae Iorga Institute of History was merged into a communist institution headed by Petre Constantinescu-Iași, while Papacostea was assigned as head of the reorganized ISSEE. Beginning in the 1960s, the national communist authorities capitalized on Nicolae Iorga's image, suggesting that he was a forerunner of Nicolae Ceaușescu's official ideology. Iorga was promoted to the national communist pantheon as an \"anti-fascist\" and \"progressive\" intellectual, and references to his lifelong anti-communism were omitted. The ban on his works was selectively lifted, and some of his main books were again in print between 1968 and 1989, along with volumes of his correspondence. In 1988, Iorga was the subject of \"Drumeț în calea lupilor\", a Romanian film directed by Constantin Vaeni. It depicted an imaginary encounter and clash between the historian (Valentin Teodosiu) and a character based on Horia Sima (Dragoș Pâslaru). However, the Bonaparte Highway villa, bequeathed by Iorga to the state, was demolished during the \"Ceaușima\" campaign of 1986.\n\nIorga's theories on the Dacians and the Thracians were among the many elements synthesized into the nationalist current known as Protochronism, which claimed that the sources of Romanian identity were to be found in pre-Roman history, and was offered support by Ceaușescu's regime. His work was selectively reinterpreted by Protochronists such as Dan Zamfirescu, Mihai Ungheanu and Corneliu Vadim Tudor. Contrasting perspectives on Iorga's legacy were held by the various voices within the Romanian diaspora. On the 40th anniversary of his death, the Munich-based Romanian section of the anti-communist Radio Free Europe (RFE) broadcast an homage piece with renewed condemnation of Iorga's killers. RFE received death threats from obscure Iron Guard diaspora members, probably agents of the Securitate secret police.\n\nIorga has enjoyed posthumous popularity in the decades since the Romanian Revolution of 1989: present at the top of \"most important Romanians\" polls in the 1990s, he was voted in at No. 17 in the \"100 greatest Romanians\" televised poll. As early as 1989, the Iorga Institute was reestablished under Papacostea's direction. Since 1990, the Vălenii summer school has functioned regularly, having Iorga exegete Valeriu Râpeanu as a regular guest. In later years, the critical interpretation of Iorga's work, first proposed by Lucian Boia around 1995, was continued by a new school of historians, who distinguished between the nationalist-didactic and informative contents.\n\nNicolae Iorga had over ten children from his marriages, but many of them died in infancy. In addition to Florica Chirescu, his children from Maria Tasu were Petru, Elena, Maria; with Catinca, he fathered Mircea, Ștefan, Magdalina, Liliana, Adriana, Valentin, and Alina. Magdalina, who enjoyed success as a painter, later started a family in Italy. The only one of his children to train in history, known for her work in reediting her father's books and her contribution as a sculptor, Liliana Iorga married fellow historian Dionisie Pippidi in 1943. Alina became the wife of an Argentine jurist, Francisco P. Laplaza.\n\nMircea Iorga was married into the aristocratic Știrbey family, and then to Mihaela Bohățiel, a Transylvanian noblewoman who was reputedly a descendant of the Lemeni clan and of the medieval magnate Johannes Benkner. He was for a while attracted into PND politics, and also wrote poetry. An engineer by trade, he was headmaster of the Bucharest Electrotechnical College in the late 1930s. Another son, Ștefan N. Iorga, was a writer active with the \"Cuget Clar\" movement, and later a noted physician.\n\nIorga's niece Micaella Filitti, who worked as a civil servant in the 1930s, defected from Communist Romania and settled in France. Later descendants include historian Andrei Pippidi, son of Dionisie, who is noted as a main editor of Iorga's writings. Pippidi also prefaced collections of Iorga's correspondence, and published a biographical synthesis on his grandfather. Andrei Pippidi is married to political scientist and journalist Alina Mungiu, the sister of award-winning filmmaker Cristian Mungiu.\n\n"}

Along with the mass (known or predicted) of a body, the weight is calculated.\n\nThe acceleration due to gravity depends on the gravity of the mass, which rests inside of the object. The gravity decreases at longer distance between centers of mass. The acceleration due to gravity furthermore is influenced by the rotation of the earth. As centifugal force increases at longer earth's axis distance, thus centrifugal force is highest at the equator and lowest the poles.\n\nThe formulas for calculating the normal gravity is based on the assumption of an imagined rotationally symmetrical ellipsoid model of the earth, the surface of which is identical to an equipotential surface. Consequently this formula depends only on the geographical latitude and the elevation of geographical location.\n\nFor the normal gravity formula_1 of the sea level ellipsoid, i.e. elevation  h = 0, this formula by Somigliana (1929) applies (after Carlo Somigliana (1860–1955)):\n\nwith\n\nDue to numerical issues, the formula is simplified into this:\n\nwith\n\nFor the Geodetic Reference System 1980 (GRS 80) the parameters are set to these values:\nformula_11\n\nThe Somigliana formula was approximated through different series expansions, following this scheme:\n\nThe normal gravity formula by Gino Cassinis was determined in 1930 by International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics as international gravity formula along with Hayford ellipsoid.

After graduating in 1875, he obtained a scholarship to continue his studies in Berlin, where he studied under Theodor Mommsen and Heinrich Brunner.\n\nVinogradoff became professor of history at the University of Moscow, but his zeal for the spread of education brought him into conflict with the authorities, and consequently he was obliged to leave Russia. Having settled in England, Vinogradoff brought a powerful and original mind to bear upon the social and economic conditions of early England, a subject which he had already begun to study in Moscow.\n\nVinogradoff visited Britain for the first time in 1883, working on records in the Public Records Office and meeting leading English scholars such as Sir Henry Maine and Sir Frederick Pollock. He also met Frederic William Maitland, who was heavily influenced by their meeting.\n\nVinogradoff was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1897.\n\nIn 1903 he was elected to the position of Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Oxford, and held this position until he died in 1925. He was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1905. He received honorary degrees from the principal universities (including D.C.L. from the University of Oxford in October 1902, in connection with the tercentenary of the Bodleian Library.), was made a member of several foreign academies and was appointed honorary professor of history at Moscow.\n\nUpon the death of Maitland, Vinogradoff became the literary director of the Selden Society with Sir Frederick Pollock, a position he held until 1920. During World War I he gave valuable assistance to the British Foreign Office in connection with Russian affairs. Vinogradoff was knighted in 1917, and he and his children were naturalized as British subjects in 1918.\n\nIn 1925, Vinogradoff traveled to Paris to receive an honorary degree; while in Paris, he developed pneumonia and died there on 19 December.\n\nAccording to the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition, published in 1911, Vinogradoff's \"Villainage in England\" (1892) was \"perhaps the most important book written on the peasantry of the feudal age and the village community in England; it can only be compared for value with FW Maitland's \"Domesday Book and Beyond\". In masterly fashion Vinogradoff here shows that the villein of Norman times was the direct descendant of the Anglo-Saxon freeman, and that the typical Anglo-Saxon settlement was a free community, not a manor, the position of the freeman having steadily deteriorated in the centuries just around the Norman Conquest. The status of the villein and the conditions of the manor in the 12th and 13th centuries are set forth with a legal precision and a wealth of detail which shows its author, not only as a very capable historian, but also as a brilliant and learned jurist.\"\n\nThe article considered that almost equally valuable was Vinogradoff's essay on “Folkland” in vol. viii. of the \"English Historical Review\" (1893), which proved for the first time the real nature of this kind of land. Vinogradoff followed up his \"Villainage in England\" with \"The Growth of the Manor\" (1905) and \"English Society in the Eleventh Century\" (1908), works on the lines of his earlier book.\n\nIn \"Outlines in Historical Jurisprudence\" (1920–22), Vinogradoff traces the development of basic themes of jurisprudence, including marriage, property, and succession, in six different types of society: the totemistic, the tribal, the ancient city state, the medieval system of feudalism and canon law, and modern industrial society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He co-founded the Oakes College at the University of California at Santa Cruz and later was appointed Provost at UCSC's Merrill College. Guzmán played an influential role in the early years of the Chicano Movement, and was a key figure in the Mexican-American community nationwide. During his time in the State Department, he was responsible for formulating and implementing much of the nation's policy in Central and South America.\nBorn in Moroleon, Guanajuato in 1924, Rafael Cortez Guzmán immigrated to the U.S. as a child during the Depression, and worked for several years with his family in the fields of the Southwest before settling in East Los Angeles. He served in the Merchant Marines and Navy during World War II, participating in the final assault on Okinawa, and returned to complete an A.A. at East Los Angeles Junior College under the G.I. Bill in 1949.\n\nAfter the war, he enrolled at California State University, Los Angeles, where he earned bachelor's (1958) and master's (1960) degrees in political science. In 1955 he was named director of the Alianza Hispano-Americana's (a Mexican American fraternal insurance society) newly founded civil rights department, where he cultivated his skill in developing community support organizations. Along with Fred Ross Sr. and Congressman Edward R.

{"id": "14551492", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14551492", "title": "Social and economic stratification in Appalachia", "text": "Social and economic stratification in Appalachia\n\nThe Appalachian region of the Eastern United States is home to over 25 million people and covers parts of mostly mountainous areas of 13 states, including Mississippi, Alabama, Pennsylvania, New York, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, and the entire state of West Virginia. The near-isolation of the area's rugged topography is home to communities with a distinct culture, who in many cases are put at a disadvantage because of the transportation and infrastructure problems that have developed.\n\nAppalachia is often divided into three regions—southern (portions of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, North and South Carolina, and Tennessee), central (portions of Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Virginia, and Tennessee), and northern (parts of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ohio) Appalachia. Though all areas of Appalachia share problems of rural poverty, inadequate jobs, services, transportation, education, and infrastructure, some elements (particularly those relating to industry and natural resource extraction) are unique to each sub-region. For example, Appalachians in the central sub-region experience the deepest poverty, partially due to the area's isolation from urban growth centers.\n\nAppalachia is particularly interesting in the context of social and economic divisions within and between the region's socioeconomic communities. In addition, outsiders' often incorrect and over-generalized external perspectives, and their relationship to culture and folklore of this near-isolated area, are important to the region's future development.\n\nThough industry and business existed in Appalachia before the 20th century, the major modern industries of agriculture, large-scale coal mining, timber, and other outside corporate entries did not truly take root until this time. Many Appalachianites sold their rights to land and minerals to such corporations, to the extent that 99 percent of the residents control less than half of the land. Thus, though the area has a wealth of natural resources, natives are often poor. Since at least the 1960s, Appalachia has a higher poverty rate and a higher percentage of working poor than the rest of the nation. Wages, employment rates, and education also lag. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created in 1965 to address some of the region's problems, and though there have been improvements, serious issues still exist. Communities that are not considered \"growth centers\" are bypassed for investment and fall further behind. In 1999, roughly a quarter of the counties in the region qualified as \"distressed,\" the ARC's worst status ranking. Fifty-seven percent of adults in central Appalachia did not graduate high school (as opposed to less than 20 percent in the general U.S.), roughly 20 percent of homes have no telephone, and the population is declining.\n\nAccording to the statistics conducted by ARC, out of every three Appalachians, one suffered from poverty; their average income was 23 percent lower than the average level of American per capita income; and due to the poor infrastructure, health care, high unemployment rate and other tough living conditions, there were two million or more Appalachians who has left their homes for living during the 1950s. Poverty in Appalachian has not been paid attention until the 1960s. In the year 1960, the Region's government was trying to solve the poverty problem with a will. After one year, the newly elected President John F. Kennedy was touched by the poverty he saw there and decided to improve the living standard of Appalachians. In 1963, President Kennedy set up President's Appalachian Regional Committee, aimed to formulate a program to improve the Appalachian economy. The program was outlined in 1964. And one year later, his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson submitted PARC's reports to the Congress and was passed in 1965.\n\nOne of the factors at the root of Appalachian economic struggles is the poor infrastructure. Though the region is crisscrossed by many U.S. and interstate highways, those routes primarily serve cross-country traffic rather than local traffic. Towns closer to the major highways and nearer to the many larger cities fringing the region (Pittsburgh, Wheeling, Columbus, Cincinnati, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., etc.) are disproportionately better-off than rural regions in the mountainous interior.\n\nTransportation may be the reason which most restricts the development of the economy. So after the Appalachian Regional Commission was established, road construction has become the first concern of regional development. In the following years, the Commission has spent plenty of capital on road construction.\n\nInstead of being tied to the land, jobs in the towns tend to emphasize industry and services—important signs of a more diversified economy. However, aside from the major urban centers along its perimeter, the entire Appalachian region still suffers from population decline and the loss of younger residents to the cities.\n\nAnother factor affecting development has been sheer inequality in power between the classes. Historically, elites interested in satisfying personal goals have controlled Appalachian politics to the expense of the region's poorer residents. Seeing no personal benefit to establishing infrastructure, they generally eschewed developments that would have been difficult and expensive to establish in the mountainous areas. Instead, they allowed the region to rely on industry—using barges to send natural resources to market, requiring that workers have only minimal education, etc.--and created no infrastructure for business.\n\nThere is a lot of evidence to show that economic status generally has a positive effect on education. This positive link suggests that people in Appalachia are less educated than in rest areas of the nation. \"Labor economists estimated that the inflation-adjusted rate of return to an additional year of schooling is about 10 percent on average\". (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland) This means, each additional school year will contribute a 10 percent average gain in earnings. \"At the same time, this 10 percent average return masks important variation in returns across individuals with different levels of schooling\". (Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland) High school graduates often earn more than those with GED recipients. During past decades, the Appalachian population are better educated than many years ago, but it still lags behind the United States' average level.\n\nFrom Burris's research, the central lands of Appalachia have been dominated by landowners who only show interest in the profits of mountaintop coal mining, undermining the importance of those who live in the areas and the effect their business has on their lives. It is the cyclical way of life where those who profit from the detrimental effects are the ones who do not have to endure those effects. This economy has caused a region-wide depression on the people as well as other afflictions such as illness and addiction. The goal is to eliminate the depression and need people feel to abuse pain medications. As systems work together to aim attention of younger generations at education instead of drugs.\n\"For well over a century now, central Appalachia has been ruled by absentee landowners only interested in making the highest profit available from natural resource extraction, primarily coal. From the beginning of its presence in the mountains, the coal industry intentionally created single-industry economies to exert absolute control over the people, the politicians, the land and the wealth that still flows out of the mountains\". (American Psychological Association)\n\nNow, with roughly 100,000 jobs left for miners, Appalachianites are unable to access jobs or the resources and opportunities necessary to lift themselves out of poverty. Some academics contend that the situation of Appalachianites amounts to one similar to that in third world countries: Residents live on land that cannot be traded outside of trusted circles or used as collateral because, due to the history of unincorporated businesses with unidentified liabilities, there are not adequate records of ownership rights. This \"dead\" capital is a factor that contributes to the historical poverty of the region, limiting Appalachianites' abilities to use their investments in home and other land-related capital.\n\nThe United States Congress finds that the reason why Appalachian abundance in natural resources lags behind in economic development is that people in this area are not share equally of nation's economic wealth. (ARC)\n\nThe elite class instilled strong systems of inequality into Appalachian politics and economy. For instance, the powerful have a history of encouraging racial divisions in order to divide workers and pit them against each other, spurring competition and serving to lower workers' wages. Family history and economic status are also bases of discrimination: One resident notes of employers, \"If you have a rich name, they'll take you--otherwise you can't get no work.\"\n\nSince the 19th century, coal operators and plantation bosses have discouraged education and civic action, allowing workers to become indebted to plantation stores, live in company housing, and generally make themselves vulnerable to the interests of their powerful employers. Community members who experienced a justifiable fear of punishment for speaking out against the corruption of the status quo developed a habit of compliance rather than democratic institutions for social change. Fearful of punishment, middle class residents allied themselves with the elites rather than challenging the system that colored their everyday lives. Burdened by the choice between exile and exploitation, the actual and potential middle class left the region, widening the gap between the poor and those in power. Observers often perceive a fatalistic attitude on the part of the Appalachian people; many suggest that this is due to the history of political corruption and disenfranchisement, which led to weak civic cultures and a sense of powerlessness. Says a volunteer in the area, \"the people usually regard politicians as crooks who won't do anything.\"\n\nIn the remote mountain districts, violent feuds usually happen. Appalachians use assassination and guns as weapons, against each other for several years. The major participants are always elite class and people who are fighting for their political rights.\n\nIn 2000, 80.49 percent of all adults in the United States were high school graduates, as opposed to 76.89 in Appalachia. Almost 30 percent of Appalachian adults are considered functionally illiterate. Education differences between men and women are greater in Appalachia than the rest of the nation, tying into a greater trend of gender inequalities.\n\nEducation in Appalachia has historically lagged behind average literacy levels of United States. At first, education in this region was largely nurtured through religious institutions. Children who found time away from family work were often taught to read about the Bible and Christian morality. Then, after the civil war, some districts established primary schools and high schools. People began to access standard education during this period, and higher education in large communities was expanded at that time. Lately, in the late 19th century and early 20th century, education in rural areas has been advanced; some settlement schools and sponsored schools were established by organizations. In the 20th century, the national policy has begun affecting education in Appalachia. Those schools were trying to meet the demands which federal and state settled. Some public schools were facing the problem of gathering funds because of government's No Child Left Behind policy. (DeYoung 1517–1521)\n\nSince Appalachia is a place with abundant resources such as coal, mineral, land and forest, the main jobs here are lumbering, mining and farming. None of these jobs need a high education, and employers don't decide the jobs based on their education level. A diploma has not been a priority in job finding. Many children of school age dropped school to help their family work. Women in Appalachia have less opportunity in access of jobs. Many kinds of jobs in this area require a strong body, so that men are preferred than women by employers when they are seeking jobs.\n\nThe National Career Development Association has organized a program hoping to increase the education in the Appalachia region, which has been deprived of what other parts of the nation take for granted. The region is primarily utilized for mining, coal, and its other natural resources and farmland. Families that live in these parts have become accustomed to a certain way of life whether it involve school or working. Many kids are not given the opportunity to be successful, only to remain in the family business surrounding one of the many natural resources from their land. The New Opportunity School for Women, NOSW, has begun offering 14 women a 3-week course in Berea, Kentucky, on employment opportunities, skills, basic knowledge that they may not have received. The NOSW also offers a residential housing opportunity to those with low-income after their participation in the course and thereafter. This brings hope to Appalachian women, although it only allows 14 participants, it is a start and that number can only grow with growth within the Appalachian region.\n\n\"Women from the Appalachian region of Kentucky and surrounding south central Appalachian states share common challenges resulting from low educational attainment, limited employment skills, few strong role models and low self-esteem. The presence of these challenges are directly linked to high incidences of early marriage, teen pregnancies, divorce, domestic violence, substance abuse and high school dropout rates\". (National Career Development Association.)\n\nThis program provides interview, job search, computer and other basic skills that are useful in careers for those less skilled. Women can participate freely, no extra money is required. Participants are provided with classes from Monday to Friday, 8 am to 12 pm and afternoon is internship time. These classes are mainly about: job search, interview skill, math, women's health, computer skills, leadership development, and self-protection. (National Career Development Association) Internships not only include working in a real work site, but also include a training of choosing interview clothes and make-ups. The organizer will also hold some events during the weekends except for additional classes. For instance, the American Association of University Women and the Berea Younger Women's Club are available for participants to choose. They can also go for a field trip to some places. All these efforts are conducted to help women build confidence in job finding. As a vulnerable group of people, these rich experiences can help them become an active part in their living communities. After graduated from NOSW, professional agencies will provides each of them counseling services about education. This program has achieved active outcomes. According to a recent survey, after attending this program, 80 percent of those women participants have incomes for less than 10,000 dollars per year with their half high school degree. Among them, 79 percent of graduates are employed, 55 percent of graduates got an associate degree (two-year), a bachelor's degree or even a master's degree, and 35 percent of graduates got a Certification Program degree. (National Career Development Association)\n\nWomen have traditionally been reedited to the domestic sphere, often lack access to resources and employment opportunities, are disproportionately represented in peripheral labor markets, and have lower wages and higher vulnerability to job loss. Throughout the region, women typically earn 64 percent of men's wages. However, when adjusted for the fact that women take less risky jobs, that require less qualifications, they make roughly the same amount. Women are also often the hardest-hit by poverty—for example, 70 percent of female-headed households with children under the age of six are in distressed counties, a figure substantially higher than the national average.\n\nWhere there is oppression, there is opposition. There are a lot of fearless and outstanding women in Appalachia who stood out to fight for their rights. Women in the Appalachia have long earned their reputation for being strong as well as struggling. Among the many men within the region, women have participated in the fields, mines, and labor movements. Many women have given their all and then some for their families and to stand up for what they believe in. Women have also made waves through literature, art, and keeping their stories and family history alive within their culture.\n\n\"Women have played a major role in the labor and activist movements in the coal-bearing regions of Appalachia.\", \"Other crucial roles for women have involved education, literature, healthcare and art, and the promotion of minorities in our region\". (Appalachian Voices).\n\nThere are many achievements conducted by outstanding women leadership. Those women devoted their lifelong efforts in improving their social status and in fighting against poverty in their communities and their living regions. A woman named Kathy Selvage was a citizen lobbyist for years and worked in the fight against a proposal for a Wise County coal-fired plant. She says that Appalachian women are people of action. Lorelei Scarbro helped establish a community center in Whitesville, W.V. to encourage outside activity besides the home and workplace. This reunites them with togetherness and a place to convene about ideas and local build-up. Vivian Stockman is the face of the stand against mountaintop removal and has worked endlessly to spread the word through photos of the detrimental effects it has on the land that people call home. These women, among countless others have done everything they can to end the poverty and depression that has plagued their region for so long.\n\n\"A coal miner's daughter from Wise County, Va., Selvage has always had a great respect for miners, but when a coal company began blasting off mountaintops in her community, Selvage began working to bring national exposure to mountaintop removal coal mining\". (Appalachian Voices).\nRural Appalachian has found projects to help women save for their life especially life after retirement. It is kind of program to help females who have problems in raising their children and retirement save money. Some women have saved surprisingly a little for their retirement and they are facing the risk of running out of their money. Appalachian Savings Project was established to alleviate this risk by recreating saving plans for those self-employed women workers who do not have those plans provided by companies. This program is aiming to help the female workers who have children to care about. Anita Wallace is a mother who operates a family day care in Athens County, Ohio. She is 40 years old while her husband is 47 years old and they have three of their own children to raise. As Wallace is self-employed, she has not provided with company retirement plans, for example, company 401(k). She often complaints about that it is expensive to raise children. Since she is not employed by an other company, to have retirement funds is a difficult thing for her. Appalachian Saving Project made her an offer that \"if she saved 600 dollars in United States saving bonds in a year, it would match half of that\".(Npr) Wallace thought it was a great idea, because even if she has not enough money to put in one month, she doesn't need to worry about that. Now she has an account and save 50 dollars per month in it. This program is designed to help women with low or relatively low incomes save for their retired life and to alleviate the retirement crisis for them. Due to the lagged economic status in Appalachian regions and discriminations, there are an increasing number of women who are getting jobs without comprehensive benefits, such as retirement plans. Instead of consumption, it is an investment to have this saving account. Many mothers put their children at first place and will not start to save money for their retirement until their children are independent and do not need their help any more. However, this program is encouraging them to save money for their own need instead of their kids'. There are also some complaints. Most of them complain that they don't have enough time to attend the financial classes and money is always not enough to spare. In a word, the road ahead of Appalachian Saving Project will not be flat. All it wants is that women can realize they can save for themselves and then save more.\n\nThough mainstream Americans assume that Appalachian culture is homogeneous in the region, many distinct locales and sub-regions exist. Over-generalizations of Appalachianites as impulsive, personalistic, and individualistic \"hillbillies\" abound. Many scholars speculate that these stereotypes have been created by powerful economic and political forces to justify exploitation of Appalachian peoples. For example, the same forces that put up barriers to prevent the development of civic culture promulgate the image of Appalachian peoples as politically apathetic, without a social consciousness, and deserving of their disenfranchised state. In spite of the region's desperate need for aid, weariness of being represented as \"helpless, dumb and poor\" often creates an attitude of hostility among Appalachianites.\n\nIt has been suggested that Appalachia constitutes a separate status group under the sociologist Max Weber's definition. The criteria are tradition, endogamy, an emphasis on intimate interaction and isolation from outsiders, monopolization of economic opportunities, and ownership of certain commodities rather than others. Appalachia fulfills at least the first four, if not all five. Furthermore, mainstream Americans tend to see Appalachia as a separate subculture of low status. Based on these facts, it is reasonable to say that Appalachia constitutes a separate status group.\n\n"}
{"id": "8398913", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8398913", "title": "Substrata in the Vedic language", "text": "Substrata in the Vedic language\n\nVedic has a number of linguistic features which are alien to most other Indo-European languages. Prominent examples include: phonologically, the introduction of retroflexes, which alternate with dentals; morphologically, the formation of gerunds; and syntactically, the use of a quotative marker (\"iti\"). Philologists attribute such features, as well as the presence of non-Indo-European vocabulary, to a local substratum of languages encountered by Indo-Aryan peoples in Central Asia and within the Indian subcontinent, including the Dravidian languages.\n\nScholars have identified a substantial body of loanwords in the earliest Indian texts, including clear evidence of Non-Indo-Aryan elements (such as -s- following -u- in Rigvedic \"busa\"). While some loanwords are from Dravidian, and other forms are traceable to Munda or Proto-Burushaski, the bulk have no sensible basis in any of these families, suggesting a source in one or more lost languages. The discovery that some loan words from one of these lost sources had also been preserved in the earliest Iranian texts, and also in Tocharian, convinced Michael Witzel and Alexander Lubotsky that the source lay in Central Asia and could be associated with the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC). Another lost language is that of the Indus Valley Civilization, which Witzel initially labelled Para-Munda, but later the Kubhā-Vipāś substrate.\n\nRetroflex phonemes are now found throughout the Burushaski, Nuristani, Dravidian and Munda families. They are reconstructed for Proto-Burushaski, Proto-Dravidian and (to a minimal extent) for Proto-Munda, and are thus clearly an areal feature of the Indian subcontinent. They are not reconstructible for either Proto-Indo-European or Proto-Indo-Iranian, and they are also not found in Mitanni–Indo-Aryan loanwords.\n\nThe acquisition of the phonological trait by early Indo-Aryan is thus unsurprising, but it does not immediately permit identification of the donor language. Since the adoption of a retroflex series does not affect poetic meter, it is impossible to say if it predates the early portions of the Rigveda or was a part of Indo-Aryan when the Rigvedic verses were being composed; however, it is certain that at the time of the redaction of the Rigveda (ca. 500 BC), the retroflex series had become part of Sanskrit phonology. There is a clear predominance of retroflexion in the Northwest (Nuristani, Dardic, Khotanese Saka, Burushaski), involving affricates, sibilants and even vowels (in Kalasha), compared to other parts of the subcontinent. It has been suggested that this points to the regional, northwestern origin of the phenomenon in Rigvedic. Bertil Tikkanen is open to the idea that various syntactical developments in Indo-Aryan could have been the result of adstratum rather than the result of substrate influences. However Tikkanen states that \"in view of the strictly areal implications of retroflexion and the occurrence of retroflexes in many early loanwords, it is hardly likely that Indo-Aryan retroflexion arose in a region that did not have a substratum with retroflexes.\"\n\nNot only the typological development of Old to Middle Indo-Aryan, but already the phonological development from Pre-Vedic to Vedic (including even the oldest attested form in the Rig-Veda) is suggestive of Dravidian influence.\n\nIn 1955 Burrow listed some 500 words in Sanskrit that he considered to be loans from non-Indo-European languages. He noted that in the earliest form of the language such words are comparatively few, but they progressively become more numerous. Though mentioning the likelihood that one source was lost Indian languages extinguished by the advance of Indo-Aryan, he concentrated on finding loans from Dravidian. Kuiper identified 383 specifically Rigvedic words as non-Indo-Aryan — roughly 4% of its vocabulary. Oberlies prefers to consider 344–358 \"secure\" non-Indo-European words in the Rigveda. Even if all local non-Indo-Aryan names of persons and places are subtracted from Kuiper's list, that still leaves some 211–250 \"foreign\" words, around 2% of the total vocabulary of the Rigveda.\n\nThese loanwords cover local flora and fauna, agriculture and artisanship, terms of toilette, clothing and household. Dancing and music are particularly prominent, and there are some items of religion and beliefs. They only reflect village life, and not the intricate civilization of the Indus cities, befitting a post-Harappan time frame. In particular, Indo-Aryan words for plants stem in large part from other language families, especially from the now-lost substrate languages.\n\nMayrhofer identified a \"prefixing\" language as the source of many non-Indo-European words in the Rigveda, based on recurring prefixes like \"ka-\" or \"ki-\", that have been compared by Michael Witzel to the Munda prefix \"k-\" for designation of persons, and the plural prefix \"ki\" seen in Khasi, though he notes that in Vedic, \"k-\" also applies to items merely connected with humans and animals. Examples include:\n\nWitzel remarks that these words span all of local village life. He considers that they were drawn from the lost language of the northern Indus Civilization and its Neolithic predecessors. As they abound in Austroasiatic-like prefixes, he initially chose to call it Para-Munda, but later the Kubhā-Vipāś substrate.\n\nThe Indo-Europeanist and Indologist Thieme has questioned Dravidian etymologies proposed for Vedic words, for most of which he gives Indo-Aryan or Sanskrit etymologies, and has condemned what he characterizes as a misplaced \"zeal for hunting up Dravidian loans in Sanskrit\". Das even contended that there is \"not a single case\" in which a \"communis opinio\" has been found confirming the foreign origin of a Rigvedic word\". Kuiper answered that charge. Burrow in turn has criticized the \"resort to tortuous reconstructions in order to find, by hook or by crook, Indo-European explanations for Sanskrit words\". Kuiper reasons that given the abundance of Indo-European comparative material — and the scarcity of Dravidian or Munda — the inability to clearly confirm whether the etymology of a Vedic word is Indo-European implies that it is not.\n\nColin Masica could not find etymologies from Indo-European or Dravidian or Munda or as loans from Persian for 31 percent of agricultural and flora terms of Hindi. He proposed an origin in an unknown language \"X\". Southworth also notes that the flora terms did not come from either Dravidian or Munda. Southworth found only five terms which are shared with Munda, leading to his suggestion that \"the presence of other ethnic groups, speaking other languages, must be assumed for the period in question\".\n\nTerms borrowed from an otherwise unknown language include those relating to cereal-growing and breadmaking (bread, ploughshare, seed, sheaf, yeast), waterworks (canal, well), architecture (brick, house, pillar, wooden peg), tools or weapons (axe, club), textiles and garments (cloak, cloth, coarse garment, hem, needle) and plants (hemp, mustard, soma plant). Lubotsky pointed out that the phonological and morphological similarity of 55 loanwords in Iranian and in Sanskrit indicate that both share a common substratum, or perhaps two dialects of the same substratum. He concludes that the BMAC language of the population of the towns of Central Asia (where Indo-Iranians must have arrived in the 2nd millennium BC) and the language spoken in Punjab (see Harappan below) were intimately related. However, the prevailing interpretation is that Harappan is not related, and the 55 loanwords entered Proto-Indo-Iranian during its development in the Sintashta culture in distant contact with the Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex, and then many more words with the same origin enriched Old Indic as it developed among pastoralists who integrated with and perhaps ruled over the declining BMAC.\n\nExamples:\n\nWitzel initially used the term \"Para-Munda\" to denote a hypothetical language related but not ancestral to modern Munda languages, which he identified as \"Harappan\", the language of the Indus Valley Civilization. To avoid confusion with Munda, he later opted for the term \"Kubhā-Vipāś substrate\". He argues that the Rigveda shows signs of this hypothetical Harappan influence in the earliest level and Dravidian only in later levels, suggesting that speakers of Harappan were the original inhabitants of Punjab and that the Indo-Aryans encountered speakers of Dravidian not before middle Rigvedic times. Krishnamurti deems the evidence too meagre for this proposal. Regarding Witzel's methodology in claiming Para-Munda origins, Krishnamurti states: \"The main flaw in Witzel's argument is his inability to show a large number of complete, unanalyzed words from Munda borrowed into the first phase of the \"Ṛgveda\"... It would have been better if [Witzel] said we did not know the true source of 300 or so early borrowings into the \"Ṛgveda\".\" This statement, however, confuses Proto-Munda and Para-Munda and neglects the several hundred \"complete, unanalyzed words\" from a prefixing language, adduced by Kuiper and Witzel.\n\nA concern raised in the identification of the substrate is that there is a large time gap between the comparative materials, which can be seen as a serious methodological drawback. One issue is the early geographical distribution of the South Asian languages. It should not be assumed that the present-day northern location of Brahui, Kurukh, and Malto reflects the position of their ancestor languages at the time of Indo-Aryan development. Another problem is that modern literary languages may present a misleading picture of their prehistoric ancestors. The first completely intelligible, datable, and sufficiently long and complete epigraphs that might be of some use in linguistic comparison are the Tamil inscriptions of the Pallava dynasty of about 550, and the early Tamil Brahmi inscriptions starting in the 2nd century BC. Similarly there is much less material available for comparative Munda and the interval in their case is at least three millennia. However reconstructions of Proto-Dravidian and Proto-Munda now help in distinguishing the traits of these languages from those of Indo-European in the evaluation of substrate and loan words.\n\nThere are an estimated thirty to forty Dravidian loanwords in Vedic. Those for which Dravidian etymologies are certain include \"kulāya\" \"nest\", \"kulpha\" \"ankle\", \"\" \"stick\", \"kūla\" \"slope\", \"bila\" \"hollow\", \"khala\" \"threshing floor\". However Witzel finds Dravidian loans only from the middle Rigvedic period, suggesting that linguistic contact between Indo-Aryan and Dravidian speakers only occurred as the Indo-Aryans expanded well into and beyond the Punjab.\n\nWhile Dravidian languages are primarily confined to the South of India today, there is a striking exception: Brahui (which is spoken in parts of Baluchistan). It has been taken by some as the linguistic equivalent of a relict population, perhaps indicating that Dravidian languages were formerly much more widespread and were supplanted by the incoming Indo-Aryan languages. Certainly some Dravidian place-names are found in now Indo-Aryan regions of central India, and possibly even as far northwest as Sindh. However, it is now argued by Elfenbein that the Brahui could only have migrated to Balochistan from central India after 1000, because of the lack of any older Iranian (Avestan) loanwords in Brahui. The main Iranian contributor to Brahui vocabulary, Balochi, is a western Iranian language like Kurdish, and moved to the area from the west only around 1000.\n\nAs noted above, retroflex phonemes in early Indo-Aryan cannot identify the donor language as specifically Dravidian. Krishnamurti argues the Dravidian case for other features: \"Besides, the Veda has used the gerund, not found in Avestan, with the same grammatical function as in Dravidian, as a nonfinite verb for 'incomplete' action. Vedic language also attests the use of \"iti\" as a quotative clause complementizer.\" However, such features are also found in the indigenous Burushaski language of the Pamirs and cannot be attributed only to Dravidian influence on the early Rigveda.\n\nKuiper identified one of the donor languages to Indo-Aryan as Proto-Munda. Munda linguist Gregory D. Anderson states: \"It is surprising that nothing in the way of quotations from a Munda language turned up in (the hundreds and hundreds of) Sanskrit and middle-Indic texts. There is also a surprising lack of borrowings of names of plants/animal/bird, etc. into Sanskrit (Zide and Zide 1976). Much of what has been proposed for Munda words in older Indic (e.g. Kuiper 1948) has been rejected by careful analysis. Some possible Munda names have been proposed, for example, \"Savara\" (Sora) or \"Khara\", but ethnonymy is notoriously messy for the identification of language groups, and a single ethnonym may be adopted and used for linguistically rather different or entirely unrelated groups\".\n"}

It stars then-President of the United States Bill Clinton as himself. The film was designed by officials of the outgoing Clinton administration to neutralize media portrayals of Bill Clinton as a \"lame duck\" president by exaggerating that narrative to the point of absurdity.\n\n\"The Final Days\" is a comedic look at Clinton's last days in the White House as he approached lame duck status. In it, he is shown \"roaming the halls of an empty White House like a lost 222-pound [100 kg] puppy in search of a purpose\".\n\nThe idea for the film came from Clinton's joke writer Mark Katz who had observed that a dominant media narrative in the late days of the 2000 election was that the incumbent president, whose wife was campaigning for U.S. Senate while national attention was focused on the presidential contest between Al Gore and George W. Bush, was \"increasingly being depicted as the lonely guy minding the store\". The film was intended to subvert that narrative by establishing ownership of it. In a 2007 analysis of rhetorical humor in American political communication, Michael Andrew Phillips-Anderson argued that the film satirized, not Clinton, but rather the media who had suggested the president had advanced to lame duck status. By showing Clinton involved in mundane tasks that would be extraordinary for a U.S. president to undertake, such as answering the White House switchboard and practicing origami, the film served to erode such assertions by highlighting their absurdity.\n\"The Final Days\" was filmed in and around the White House. Ultimately, several sequences shot by director Philip Rosenthal were not incorporated into the film, including one showing a crossword puzzle-playing Clinton phoning Vladimir Putin on the Moscow–Washington hotline (also known as the \"red phone\") to ask \"what's a five-letter word for 'tasty Russian pancake'?\"\n\nThe film's production was financed by the Democratic Party.\n\n\"The Final Days\" starred Bill Clinton as himself, with cameo appearances by a number of journalists and U.S. government officials, including: Helen Thomas, Madeleine Albright, Sam Donaldson, and Al Gore. Kevin Spacey also makes a brief appearance, as himself, retrieving the Academy Award he won at that year's Oscars for Best Actor (in the film \"American Beauty\") from Clinton. Commercial actor Mike Maronna plays the character \"Stuart\", a fictional White House staff member.\n\nThe film's debuted at the White House Correspondents' Dinner held at the Washington Hilton on April 29, 2000.\n\n\"The Final Days\" was well received by those attending the dinner. It was downloaded more than 200,000 times in the week following its debut, described by \"Entertainment Weekly\" as having gone \"viral\".\n\nSome criticized the film, however. Susan Silver, a staff writer for \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" and \"The Bob Newhart Show\", predicted that, as a result of the film's success, future presidents would be judged by voters on their ability to deliver a \"laugh riot\" rather than on substantive policy positions.\n\n"}

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines traditional medicine as \"the sum total of the knowledge, skills, and practices based on the theories, beliefs, and experiences indigenous to different cultures, whether explicable or not, used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illness\".\n\nIn some Asian and African countries, up to 80% of the population relies on traditional medicine for their primary health care needs. When adopted outside its traditional culture, traditional medicine is often considered a form of alternative medicine. Practices known as traditional medicines include traditional European medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Korean medicine, traditional African medicine, Ayurveda, Siddha medicine, Unani, ancient Iranian Medicine, Iranian (Persian), Islamic medicine, Muti, and Ifá. Scientific disciplines which study traditional medicine include herbalism, ethnomedicine, ethnobotany, and medical anthropology.\n\nThe WHO notes, however, that \"inappropriate use of traditional medicines or practices can have negative or dangerous effects\" and that \"further research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety\" of several of the practices and medicinal plants used by traditional medicine systems. Ultimately, the World Health Organization has implemented a nine year strategy to \"support Member States in developing proactive policies and implementing action plans that will strengthen the role traditional medicine plays in keeping populations healthy.\"\n\nIn the written record, the study of herbs dates back 5,000 years to the ancient Sumerians, who described well-established medicinal uses for plants. In Ancient Egyptian medicine, the Ebers papyrus from c. 1552 BC records a list of folk remedies and magical medical practices. The Old Testament also mentions herb use and cultivation in regards to Kashrut.\n\nMany herbs and minerals used in Ayurveda were described by ancient Indian herbalists such as Charaka and Sushruta during the 1st millennium BC. The first Chinese herbal book was the \"Shennong Bencao Jing\", compiled during the Han Dynasty but dating back to a much earlier date, which was later augmented as the \"Yaoxing Lun\" (\"Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs\") during the Tang Dynasty. Early recognised Greek compilers of existing and current herbal knowledge include Pythagoras and his followers, Hippocrates, Aristotle, Theophrastus, Dioscorides and Galen.\n\nRoman sources included Pliny the Elder's \"Natural History\" and Celsus's \"De Medicina\". Pedanius Dioscorides drew on and corrected earlier authors for his \"De Materia Medica\", adding much new material; the work was translated into several languages, and Turkish, Arabic and Hebrew names were added to it over the centuries. Latin manuscripts of \"De Materia Medica\" were combined with a Latin herbal by Apuleius Platonicus (\"Herbarium Apuleii Platonici\") and were incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon codex \"Cotton Vitellius C.III\". These early Greek and Roman compilations became the backbone of European medical theory and were translated by the Persian Avicenna (Ibn Sīnā, 980–1037), the Persian Rhazes (Rāzi, 865–925) and the Jewish Maimonides.\n\nArabic indigenous medicine developed from the conflict between the magic-based medicine of the Bedouins and the Arabic translations of the Hellenic and Ayurvedic medical traditions. Spanish indigenous medicine was influenced by the Arabs from 711 to 1492. Islamic physicians and Muslim botanists such as al-Dinawari and Ibn al-Baitar significantly expanded on the earlier knowledge of materia medica. The most famous Persian medical treatise was Avicenna's \"The Canon of Medicine\", which was an early pharmacopoeia and introduced clinical trials. The \"Canon\" was translated into Latin in the 12th century and remained a medical authority in Europe until the 17th century. The Unani system of traditional medicine is also based on the \"Canon\".\n\nTranslations of the early Roman-Greek compilations were made into German by Hieronymus Bock whose herbal, published in 1546, was called \"Kreuter Buch\". The book was translated into Dutch as \"Pemptades\" by Rembert Dodoens (1517–1585), and from Dutch into English by Carolus Clusius, (1526–1609), published by Henry Lyte in 1578 as \"A Nievve Herball\". This became John Gerard's (1545–1612) \"Herball or General Hiftorie of Plantes\". Each new work was a compilation of existing texts with new additions.\n\nWomen's folk knowledge existed in undocumented parallel with these texts. Forty-four drugs, diluents, flavouring agents and emollients mentioned by Dioscorides are still listed in the official pharmacopoeias of Europe. The Puritans took Gerard's work to the United States where it influenced American Indigenous medicine.\n\nFrancisco Hernández, physician to Philip II of Spain spent the years 1571–1577 gathering information in Mexico and then wrote \"Rerum Medicarum Novae Hispaniae Thesaurus\", many versions of which have been published including one by Francisco Ximénez. Both Hernandez and Ximenez fitted Aztec ethnomedicinal information into the European concepts of disease such as \"warm\", \"cold\", and \"moist\", but it is not clear that the Aztecs used these categories. Juan de Esteyneffer's \"Florilegio medicinal de todas las enfermedas\" compiled European texts and added 35 Mexican plants.\n\nMartín de la Cruz wrote an herbal in Nahuatl which was translated into Latin by Juan Badiano as \"Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis\" or \"Codex Barberini, Latin 241\" and given to King Carlos V of Spain in 1552. It was apparently written in haste and influenced by the European occupation of the previous 30 years. Fray Bernardino de Sahagún's used ethnographic methods to compile his codices that then became the \"Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España\", published in 1793. Castore Durante published his \"Herbario Nuovo\" in 1585 describing medicinal plants from Europe and the East and West Indies. It was translated into German in 1609 and Italian editions were published for the next century.\n\nIn 17th and 18th-century America, traditional folk healers, frequently women, used herbal remedies, cupping and leeching. Native American traditional herbal medicine introduced cures for malaria, dysentery, scurvy, non-venereal syphilis, and goiter problems. Many of these herbal and folk remedies continued on through the 19th and into the 20th century, with some plant medicines forming the basis for modern pharmacology.\n\nThe prevalence of folk medicine in certain areas of the world varies according to cultural norms. Some modern medicine is based on plant phytochemicals that had been used in folk medicine. Researchers state that many of the alternative treatments are \"statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments\".\n\nIndigenous medicine is generally transmitted orally through a community, family and individuals until \"collected\". Within a given culture, elements of indigenous medicine knowledge may be diffusely known by many, or may be gathered and applied by those in a specific role of healer such as a shaman or midwife. Three factors legitimize the role of the healer – their own beliefs, the success of their actions and the beliefs of the community. When the claims of indigenous medicine become rejected by a culture, generally three types of adherents still use it – those born and socialized in it who become permanent believers, temporary believers who turn to it in crisis times, and those who only believe in specific aspects, not in all of it.\n\nTraditional medicine may sometimes be considered as distinct from folk medicine, and the considered to include formalized aspects of folk medicine. Under this definition folk medicine are longstanding remedies passed on and practised by lay people. Folk medicine consists of the healing practices and ideas of body physiology and health preservation known to some in a culture, transmitted informally as general knowledge, and practiced or applied by anyone in the culture having prior experience.\n\nMany countries have practices described as folk medicine which may coexist with formalized, science-based, and institutionalized systems of medical practice represented by conventional medicine. Examples of folk medicine traditions are traditional Chinese medicine, traditional Korean medicine, Arabic indigenous medicine, Uyghur traditional medicine, Japanese Kampō medicine, traditional Aboriginal bush medicine, and Georgian folk medicine, among others.\n\nA home remedy (sometimes also referred to as a granny cure) is a treatment to cure a disease or ailment that employs certain spices, vegetables, or other common items. Home remedies may or may not have medicinal properties that treat or cure the disease or ailment in question, as they are typically passed along by laypersons (which has been facilitated in recent years by the Internet). Many are merely used as a result of tradition or habit or because they are effective in inducing the placebo effect. One of the more popular examples of a home remedy is the use of chicken soup to treat respiratory infections such as a cold or mild flu. Other examples of home remedies include duct tape to help with setting broken bones; and duct tape or superglue to treat plantar warts; and Kogel mogel to treat sore throat. In earlier times, mothers were entrusted with all but serious remedies. Historic cookbooks are frequently full of remedies for dyspepsia, fevers, and female complaints. Components of the aloe vera plant are used to treat skin disorders. Many European liqueurs or digestifs were originally sold as medicinal remedies. In Chinese folk medicine, medicinal congees (long-cooked rice soups with herbs), foods, and soups are part of treatment practices.\n\nAlthough 130 countries have regulations on folk medicines, there are risks associated with the use of them. It is often assumed that because supposed medicines are herbal or natural that they are safe, but numerous precautions are associated with using herbal remedies.\n\nEndangered animals, such as the slow loris, are sometimes killed to make traditional medicines.\n\nShark fins have also been used in traditional medicine, and although its use has not been proven, it is hurting shark populations and their ecosystem.\n\n"}
{"id": "176342", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=176342", "title": "Uxmal", "text": "Uxmal\n\nUxmal (Yucatec Maya: \"Óoxmáal\" ) is an ancient Maya city of the classical period in present-day Mexico. It is considered one of the most important archaeological sites of Maya culture, along with Palenque, Chichén, and Calakmul in Mexico, Caracol and Xunantunich in Belize, and Tikal in Guatemala. It is located in the Puuc region and is considered one of the Maya cities most representative of the region's dominant architectural style. It has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in recognition of its significance.\n\nIt is located 62 km south of Mérida, capital of Yucatán state in Mexico. Its buildings are noted for their size and decoration. Ancient roads called \"sacbes\" connect the buildings, and also were built to other cities in the area such as Chichén Itzá in modern-day Mexico, Caracol and Xunantunich in modern-day Belize, and Tikal in modern-day Guatemala.\n\nIts buildings are typical of the Puuc style, with smooth low walls that open on ornate friezes based on representations of typical Maya huts. These are represented by columns (representing the reeds used for the walls of the huts) and trapezoidal shapes (representing the thatched roofs). Entwined snakes and, in many cases two-headed snakes are used for masks of the rain god, \"Chaac;\" its big noses represent the rays of the storms. Feathered serpents with open fangs are shown leaving from the same human beings. Also seen in some cities are the influences of the Nahua, who followed the cult of \"Quetzalcoatl\" and \"Tlaloc.\" These were integrated with the original elements of the Puuc tradition.\n\nThe buildings take advantage of the terrain to gain height and acquire important volumes, including the Pyramid of the Magician, with five levels, and the Governor's Palace, which covers an area of more than .\n\nThe present name seems to derive from \"Oxmal,\" meaning \"three times built\". This seems to refer to the site's antiquity and the times it had to rebuild. The etymology is disputed; another possibility is \"Uchmal\" which means \"what is to come, the future.\" By tradition, this was supposed to be an \"invisible city,\" built in one night by the magic of the dwarf king.\n\nWhile much work has been done at the popular tourist destination of Uxmal to consolidate and restore buildings, little in the way of serious archeological excavation and research has been done. The city's dates of occupation are unknown and the estimated population (about 15,000 people) is a rough guess. Most of the city's major construction took place while Uxmal was the capital of a Late Classic Maya state around 850-925 AD. After about 1000 AD, Toltec invaders took over, and most building ceased by 1100 AD.\n\nMaya chronicles say that Uxmal was founded about 500 A.D. by Hun Uitzil Chac Tutul Xiu. For generations Uxmal was ruled over by the Xiu family. It was the most powerful site in western Yucatán, and for a while, in alliance with Chichen Itza, dominated all of the northern Maya area. Sometime after about 1200, no new major construction seems to have been made at Uxmal, possibly related to the fall of Uxmal's ally Chichen Itza and the shift of power in Yucatán to Mayapan. The Xiu moved their capital to Maní, and the population of Uxmal declined.\n\nUxmal was dominant from 875 to 900 CE. The site appears to have been the capital of a regional state in the Puuc region from 850-950 CE. The Maya dynasty expanded their dominion over their neighbors. This prominence did not last long, as the population dispersed around 1000 CE.\n\nAfter the Spanish conquest of Yucatán (in which the Xiu allied with the Spanish), early colonial documents suggest that Uxmal was still an inhabited place of some importance into the 1550s. As the Spanish did not build a town here, Uxmal was soon after largely abandoned.\n\nThe Mayan story \"The Dwarf-Wizard of Uxmal\" is set in Uxmal.\n\nEven before the restoration work, Uxmal was in better condition than many other Maya sites. Much was built with well-cut stones set into a core of concrete not relying on plaster to hold the building together. The Maya architecture here is considered matched only by that of Palenque in elegance and beauty. The Puuc style of Maya architecture predominates. Thanks to its good state of preservation, it is one of the few Maya cities where the casual visitor can get a good idea of how the entire ceremonial center looked in ancient times.\n\nSome of the more noteworthy buildings include:\n\n\nThe structure is featured in one of the best-known tales of Yucatec Maya folklore, \"el enano del Uxmal\" (\"the dwarf of Uxmal\"), which is also the basis for the structure's common name. Multiple versions of this tale are recorded. It was popularised after one of these was recounted by John Lloyd Stephens in his influential 1841 book, \"Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan\". According to Stephens' version, the pyramid was magically built overnight during a series of challenges issued to a dwarf by the \"gobernador\" (ruler or king) of Uxmal. The dwarf's mother (a \"bruja, or witch) arranged the trial of strength and magic to compete against the king.\nA number of other temple-pyramids, quadrangles, and other monuments, some of significant size, and in varying states of preservation, are also at Uxmal. These include North Long Building, House of the Birds, House of the Turtles, Grand Pyramid, House of the Doves, and South Temple.\n\nThe majority of hieroglyphic inscriptions were on a series of stone stelae unusually grouped together on a single platform. The stelae depict the ancient rulers of the city. They show signs that they were deliberately broken and toppled in antiquity; some were re-erected and repaired. A further suggestion of possible war or battle is found in the remains of a wall which encircled most of the central ceremonial center.\n\nA large raised stone pedestrian causeway links Uxmal with the site of Kabah, some 18 km to the south-east. Archaeological research at the small island site of Uaymil, located to the west on the Gulf coast, suggests that it may have served as a port for Uxmal and provided the site access to the circum-peninsular trade network.\n\nThe site, located not far from Mérida beside a road to Campeche, has attracted many visitors since the time of Mexico's independence. The first detailed account of the ruins was published by Jean Frederic Waldeck in 1838. John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood made two extended visits to Uxmal in the early 1840s, with architect/draftsman Catherwood reportedly making so many plans and drawings that they could be used to construct a duplicate of the ancient city (unfortunately most of the drawings are lost).) Désiré Charnay took a series of photographs of Uxmal in 1860. Some three years later Empress Carlota of Mexico visited Uxmal; in preparation for her visit local authorities had some statues and architectural elements depicting phallic themes removed from the ancient façades.\n\nSylvanus G. Morley made a map of the site in 1909 which included some previously overlooked buildings. The Mexican government's first project to protect some of the structures from risk of collapse or further decay came in 1927. In 1930 Frans Blom led a Tulane University expedition to the site. They made plaster casts of the façades of the \"Nunnery Quadrangle\"; using these casts, a replica of the Quadrangle was constructed and displayed at the 1933 World's Fair in Chicago, Illinois. The plaster replicas of the architecture were destroyed following the fair, but some of the plaster casts of Uxmal's monuments are still kept at Tulane's Middle American Research Institute. In 1936 a Mexican government repair and consolidation program was begun under José Erosa Peniche.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom visited on 27 February 1975 for the inauguration of the site's sound & light show. When the presentation reached the point where the sound system played the Maya prayer to Chaac (the Maya rain deity), a sudden torrential downpour occurred. Gathered dignitaries included Gaspar Antonio Xiu, a descendant of the Xiu noble Maya lineage.\n\nThree hotels and a small museum have been built within walking distance of the ancient city.\n\nMicrobial biofilms have been found degrading stone buildings at Uxmal and Kabah. Phototrophs such as \"Xenococcus\" are found more often on interior walls. However stone degrading \"Gloeocapsa\" and \"Synechocystis\" were also present in large numbers. \"Aureobasidium\" and \"Fusarium\" fungi species are present at Chichen Itza and Uxmal. Cyanobacteria were prevalent in the interiors of rooms with low light levels.\n\n\n"}
