The term parallels \"anglophone\" and \"francophone\", which designate people whose mother tongues are English and French, respectively. Native speakers of aboriginal languages are generally not treated as allophones.\n\nThe word \"allophone\" (from Greek \"allóphōnos\" \"speaking a foreign tongue\") is formed from the Greek roots (\"állos\"), meaning \"other\", and (\"phōnḗ\"), meaning \"sound\" or \"voice\". The term became popularized during the Quiet Revolution as French Canadian society in Quebec sought to integrate immigrants, most of whom had traditionally integrated into the English-speaking community. As integrating immigrants was deemed essential to assure the survival of French-speaking Quebec in light of plummeting birth rates, demographers devised this category to monitor the integration of immigrants into French- and English-speaking communities. Because allophones often adopt English, French or both languages at home or learn one language before another, they can be grouped into English or French communities based on home language or first official language learned.\n\nIn 2006, 20% of the population of Canada were allophones.\n\nIn 2001, 24.2% of the population of Ontario were allophones.\n\nAllophones constitute an increasing share of the Quebec population and are the main source of population increase in the province, reflecting both increased levels of immigration, declining birthrates among established anglophone and francophone populations, and a shift in immigration from English-speaking countries to Asia and the Americas. In 1971, allophones were 6.6% of the population; by 2001, this had increased to 10.0%. Speakers of Arabic, Spanish and Haitian Creole experienced the greatest growth from 1996 to 2001.\n\nIncreasing numbers of allophones speak French at home: about 20.4% of allophones in the province reported that they spoke French most often at home in 2001, compared with 16.6% in 1996 and 15.4% in 1991. Most allophones live in Montreal, Quebec's largest metropolitan area. They tend to migrate out of the province: between 1996 and 2001, over 19,170 migrated to other provinces; 18,810 who migrated to Ontario.\n\nThe majority of allophone students in Quebec attend francophone schools.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26716006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26716006", "title": "Arts in Second Life", "text": "Arts in Second Life\n\nArts in \"Second Life\" is an artistic area of a 3D social network (called \"Second Life\") that has served, since 2003, as a platform for various artistic pursuits and exhibitions. SL Photography is one of the most popular forms of artistic expression with images known as \"snapshots\" produced while travelling through \"Second Life\"s virtual environment. Many of these snapshots are displayed through various mediums that include Art Galleries, Machinima websites and Second Life Magazines.\n\nSecond Life has created an environment where artists can display their works to an audience across the world. This has created an entire artistic culture where many residents display art in the museums, galleries and homes they can buy or build using Second Life's powerful tools. Gallery openings even allow art patrons to \"meet\" and socialize with exhibiting artists and has even led to many real life sales.\n\nNumerous art gallery simulations (called \"sims\") abound in Second Life. Among the more popular galleries are the Sisse Singhs Art Gallery, the Windlight art Gallery and the Horus Art Gallery. Among the most notable of these was the art gallery sim Cetus Gallery District, the world's first virtual online urban arts district. Cetus was modeled on real world analogs such as New York's Chelsea gallery district as a mixed-use arts community of virtual galleries, offices, loft apartments, and coffee houses. Its many tenant-run businesses featured weekly live music performances, gallery openings, and literary events such as the virtual book launch for \"Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human,\" by Tom Boellstorf (Princeton University Press; 2008). Cetus was chosen Best Cultural Site in Second Life in 2007, and its creator avatar Xander Ruttan (real world arts professional Aaron Collins of California), was among the most influential art world avatars in SL. Cetus resulted in many ongoing collaborative efforts among the SL community of artists, designers, writers, and virtual builders from across the real and virtual worlds. (Cetus was later bought by virtual artist DB Bailey and converted into a personal art project).\n\nThe modeling tools from \"Second Life\" allow the artists also to create new forms of art that in many ways are not possible in real life due to physical constraints or high associated costs. The virtual arts are visible in over 2050 \"museums\" (according to SL's own search engine).\n\nIn 2008 Haydn Shaughnessy, real life gallerist, along with his wife Roos Demol hired a real life architect, New York based, Benn Dunkley to design a gallery in Second Life. Dunkleys goal was to design an interactive gallery with art in mind in a virtual world. \"Ten Cubed\" is a radical departure in art exhibition, a futuristically designed gallery showcasing art in a unique setting. On January 31, 2008, \"Ten Cubed\" was launched. \nFor its inaugural exhibition, \"Crossing the Void II\", owner and curator Shaughnessy selected five artists working in and with modern technologies. These artists included Chris Ashley based in Oakland, California, Jon Coffelt based in New York, New York, Claire Keating based in Cork, Ireland, Scott Kildall based in San Francisco, California and Nathaniel Stern originally based in New York, New York now in Dublin, Ireland. Real life as well as Second Life editions are available from the gallery.\n\nThe virtual creations from the metaverse are disclosed in real life by initiatives such as Fabjectory (statuettes) and Secondlife-Art.com (oil paintings).\n\nIn April 2007 the huge gallery called crossworlds gallery opened its doors in Secondlife; therefore, the aim was to create an open space for art in virtual worlds. Also in 2007, artists Adam Nash, Christopher Dodds and Justin Clemens won a A$20,000 Second Life Artists in Residence grant from the Australia Council for the Arts. Their \"Babelswarm\" installation was launched in Second Life and The Lismore Regional Gallery in NSW, Australia on April 11, 2008 by Australia Council Chairman James Strong.\nIn 2008, the French Artist Fred Forest had entered the virtual world of Second Life to show his art project for the first time in his country. He inaugurated his \"Experimental Center of the Territory of M2\" (\"Centre expérimental du terrioire du M2\"), where he invited politicians to discuss about sustainable development and digital identity card ( Capucine.net). In another art project, he discussed about art institutions in France in his action called \"l'art de la corrida\".\n\nLive music performances in \"Second Life\" takes place in three distinctly different ways;\n\nLinden Lab added an Event Category \"Live Music\" in March 2006 to accommodate the increasing number of scheduled events. By the beginning of 2008, scheduled live music performance events in \"Second Life\" spanned every musical genre, and included hundreds of live musicians and DJs who perform on a regular basis. A typical day in \"Second Life\" will feature dozens of live music performances.\n\nIn 2008 the UK act Redzone announced they would release their new live album only via Second Life.\n\nRedzone also began choreographing and synchronising their performances via MIDI in October 2008.\n\nMany amateur performers start their music careers in Second Life by performing at virtual karaoke bars or Open Mic, then progress to performing for \"pay\", or Linden dollars, in-world.\n\n\"Second Life\" is popular for filming with machinima. Virtual worlds can contain all aspects of real world filming techniques as well as many more not possible in the real world. It is far easier to create 3D objects in \"Second Life\" and film them than create them from 'scratch' using traditional CGI software.\nThere are many machinima and performing arts groups that are active in \"Second Life\" and which participate in creative events such as the annual 48 Hour Film Project. There are also several machinima groups that actively promote the works of Second Life artists such as Machinima Mondays, Rezzed TV, MAGE Magazine and the Machinima Artist's guild.\n\nLive theater is presented in \"Second Life\". The SL Shakespeare Company performed an act from \"Hamlet\" live in February 2008. In 2009, the company produced scenes from \"Twelfth Night\".\n\nIn 2007 Johannes von Matuschka and Daniel Michelis developed Wunderland, an interactive SL theatre play at Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin, Germany.\n\nIn 2007, HBO hosted a comedy festival in \"Second Life,\" using live streaming audio. In March 2009, SL residents staged a two-day Virtually Funny Comedy Festival to \"help build awareness for Comic Relief, Red Nose Day 2009 and of course, comedy in Second Life.\"\n\nIn December 2008, The Learning Experience, a not-for-profit virtual education campus in Second Life, staged its first live theater events with the production of two short plays, \"A Matter of Husbands\" by Ferenc Molnár and \"Porcelain and Pink\" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. In 2009, the TLE theater company began producing full-length plays in Second Life, starting with \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" by Oscar Wilde in February, and followed by \"Candida\" by George Bernard Shaw in April.\n\nIn 2008 The Avatar Repertory Theater company was set up. This is another Theatre company that works within SL.\n\nIn 2009 the Department of Drama at the University of Calgary mounted four short productions in the New Media Consortium theater as part of a class in performance in non-traditional spaces. These plays were (a) \"Guppies\" (by Clem Martini) in March (b) The Chocolate Affair (by Stephanie Alison Walker); (c) Kingdom of the Spider (by Nick Zagone); (d) The Boy Who Cried Genie (by D. M. Bocaz-Larson).\n\nIn 2011/12, an all-furry performing arts troupe, Ravenswood Theatricals, was launched at their own venue with successful, non-commercial virtual renditions of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"The Phantom of the Opera\", the latter of which was received with glowing reviews. A number of further productions of established real-life pieces such as \"Les Misérables\", \"Tanz der Vampire\", \"Sunset Boulevard\", and \"Into the Woods\" are reportedly planned, as well as a gala presentation of various musical numbers from upcoming productions.\n\nVirtual dance has been elevated in Second Life.\n\nBallet Pixelle® (formerly Second Life Ballet) was the first performing ballet company in Second Life (2006). Ballet Pixelle®, with founder and artistic director Inarra Saarinen, produces all original animations, choreography, and music composed specifically for each ballet. All dance is done as art, not automation, with the dancers actually dancing with each other and the music—there is no artificial synchronization involved.\n\nLa Performance. started in May 2008 with live dance shows. Two shows are produced in a year, in March/April/May 2010 modern ballet show 'BACK TO BLACK' with music by Queen (band), Francisco de la Torre, Metallica, Amy Winehouse, Paula Cole, Richard Wagner, Louis Armstrong, Suzi Quatro. October/November/December 2010: 'POLYAMOUR': this modern ballet show was danced live to a live concert by REIS and Aldo Brizzi (vocals and electronics). March/April/May 2011: 'ROMANCE'. November/December 2011/January 2012: 'BORN'. March/April/May 2012: 'INSENSATEZ'.\n\nThere have been several books written about experiences in \"Second Life\". \"Second Life Love\" is example of such a book. It is a dialog between Per Olsen en Li Gang Qin about their partnership in Second Life. The authors have never seen each other in real life.\n\nOther books include \"Second Life For Dummies\" by Sarah Robbins and Mark Bell, which was published in 2008 and provides assistance for new users of the virtual world, including basics, how to meet people, ideas for activities and places to visit, including how to access real life education in \"Second Life\".\n\nAnnabeth Robinson, or AngryBeth Shortbread, creates online performances or installations using Second Life. For example, Robinson contributed to the 'Kritical Works in SL' project in 2008 to create a sound installation called \"Ping Space\". This was a piece of work that involved two cubes reverberating sound from each other which would only happen when one cube was 300 ft above the other. Other such work can be found at the Annabeth Robinson page.\n\nGarrett Lynch is an Irish new media artist working with networked technologies in a variety of forms including online art, installation, performance and writing. Since 2008 he has created a series of installation and performance works dealing with ideas of identity and place as they relate to networked spaces. In these works Lynch explores the \"real\" and the \"virtual\" through the transposing of his own identity to virtual worlds such as Second Life without any attempt to masquerade or imagine a new identity. This process involves the use of his real name for his \"representation\" or avatar, word play that references his names origins as both real and Irish and the use of a sandwich board prop stating this that is worn continuously.\n\nIn 2010/2011 he was artist in residence at HUMlab, Yoshikaze Up-in-the-Air Residency. Outcomes of the residence have since been published as an artists book and an article in Metaverse Creativity (Volume 2, Number 2). Currently Lynch has and is currently performing with a custom-built scale reproduction of his Second Life \"representations\" sandwich board. This has been worn at a number of exhibitions and performances.\n\nGleman Jun is an Italian artist in Second Life. In the dynamic effects of colors, lights and transparencies, he expresses his creativity in a constantly evolving and transforming himself. In his case, a work of art is composed of two different elements:\nvision and technique. \"Vision\" is the image that passes through his mind suddenly. \"Technique\" is the experience that allows the memory to translate the vision into a \"real\" and shareable object.\n\nSecond Front is the first performance art group of Second Life. Founded in 2006, its current seven-member troupe includes Gazira Babeli (Italy), Yael Gilks (London), Bibbe Hansen (New York), Doug Jarvis (Victoria), Scott Kildall (San Francisco), Patrick Lichty (Chicago) and Liz Solo (St. Johns).\n\nSecond Front members collaborate remotely and their performances have been shown live in New York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Brussels, Berlin, Vancouver and many other cities. The group has been written about in publications including ArtForum, Art in America, Realtime Arts (Australia), Exibart (Italy) and Digital Art, (Second Edition) by Christiane Paul (curator).\n\nSL Art is one of the most popular art groups in Second Life. Its goal is to recognize the art in virtual worlds at the same level of visual art in real life. There are several second Life publications that work to promote Second Life Art, including Windlight Magazine, the SL Newser, and the SL Enquirer.\n"}

{"id": "1879959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1879959", "title": "Christ Pantocrator", "text": "Christ Pantocrator\n\nIn Christian iconography, Christ Pantocrator is a specific depiction of Christ. \"Pantocrator\" or \"Pantokrator\" () is, used in this context, derived from of one of many names of God in Judaism.\n\nWhen the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek as the Septuagint, \"Pantokrator\" was used both for \"YHWH Sabaoth\" \"Lord of Hosts\" and for \"El Shaddai\" \"God Almighty\". In the New Testament, \"Pantokrator\" is used once by Paul () and nine times in the Book of Revelation: , , , , , , , , and . The references to God and Christ in Revelation are at times interchangeable, \"Pantokrator\" appears to be reserved for God except, perhaps, in 1:8.\n\nThe most common translation of \"Pantocrator\" is \"Almighty\" or \"All-powerful\". In this understanding, \"Pantokrator\" is a compound word formed from the Greek words , ' ( '), i.e. \"all\" and , \",\" i.e. \"strength\", \"might\", \"power\". This is often understood in terms of potential power; i.e., ability to do anything, omnipotence.\n\nAnother, more literal translation is \"Ruler of All\" or, less literally, \"Sustainer of the World\". In this understanding, Pantokrator is a compound word formed from the Greek for \"all\" and the verb meaning \"To accomplish something\" or \"to sustain something\" (, \"\"). This translation speaks more to God's actual power; i.e., God does everything (as opposed to God can do everything).\n\nThe Pantokrator, largely an Eastern Orthodox or Eastern Catholic theological conception, is less common by that name in Western (Roman) Catholicism and largely unknown to most Protestants. In the West the equivalent image in art is known as Christ in Majesty, which developed a rather different iconography.\n\n\"Christ Pantocrator\" has come to suggest Christ as a mild but stern, all-powerful judge of humanity.\n\nThe icon of Christ Pantokrator is one of the most common religious images of Orthodox Christianity. Generally speaking, in Medieval eastern roman church art and architecture, an iconic mosaic or fresco of Christ Pantokrator occupies the space in the central dome of the church, in the half-dome of the apse, or on the nave vault. Some scholars (Latourette 1975: 572) consider the Pantocrator a Christian adaptation of images of Zeus, such as the great statue of Zeus enthroned at Olympia. The development of the earliest stages of the icon from Roman Imperial imagery is easier to trace.\n\nThe image of Christ Pantocrator was one of the first images of Christ developed in the Early Christian Church and remains a central icon of the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the half-length image, Christ holds the New Testament in his left hand and makes the gesture of teaching or of blessing with his right. \nThe typical Western Christ in Majesty is a full-length icon. In the early Middle Ages, it usually presented Christ in a mandorla or other geometric frame, surrounded by the Four Evangelists or their symbols.\n\nThe oldest known surviving example of the icon of Christ Pantocrator was painted in encaustic on panel in the sixth or seventh century, and survived the period of destruction of images during the Iconoclastic disputes that twice racked the Eastern church, 726 to 787 and 814 to 842. It was preserved in Saint Catherine's Monastery, in the remote desert of the Sinai. The gessoed panel, finely painted using a wax medium on a wooden panel, had been coarsely overpainted around the face and hands at some time around the thirteenth century. When the overpainting was cleaned in 1962, the ancient image was revealed to be a very high-quality icon, probably produced in Constantinople.\n\nThe icon, traditionally half-length when in a semi-dome, which became adopted for panel icons also, depicts Christ fully frontal with a somewhat melancholy and stern aspect, with the right hand raised in blessing or, in the early encaustic panel at Saint Catherine's Monastery, the conventional rhetorical gesture that represents teaching. The left hand holds a closed book with a richly decorated cover featuring the Cross, representing the Gospels. An icon where Christ has an open book is called \"Christ the Teacher\", a variant of the Pantocrator. Christ is bearded, his brown hair centrally parted, and his head is surrounded by a halo. The icon is usually shown against a gold background comparable to the gilded grounds of mosaic depictions of the Christian emperors.\n\nOften, the name of Christ is written on each side of the halo, as IC and XC. Christ's fingers are depicted in a pose that represents the letters IC, X and C, thereby making the Christogram \"ICXC\" (for \"Jesus Christ\"). The IC is composed of the Greek characters iota (Ι) and lunate sigma (C; instead of Σ, ς)—the first and last letters of 'Jesus' in Greek (); in XC the letters are chi (Χ) and again the lunate sigma—the first and last letters of 'Christ' in Greek ().\n\nIn many cases, Christ has a cruciform halo inscribed with the letters Ο Ω Ν, i.e. \"He Who Is\".\n\n\n"}

Echternach's is the last traditional dancing procession in Europe.\n\nThe procession is held every Whit Tuesday around the streets of the city of Echternach. It honours Willibrord, the patron saint of Luxembourg, who established the Abbey of Echternach. Echternach has developed a strong tourism industry centred on the procession, which draws many thousands of tourists and pilgrims from around the world. The procession is inscribed in 2010 as \"hopping procession of Echternach\" on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.\n\nThe event begins in the morning at the bridge over the River Sauer, with a sermon delivered by the parish priest (formerly by the abbot of the monastery). \"Willibrordus-Brauverein\" officials put together the procession, forming several dozen alternating groups of musicians and pilgrims. The procession then moves through the town streets towards the basilica, a distance of about . While the musicians play the \"Sprangprozessioùn\" tune–a traditional melody, not entirely unlike an Irish jig or reel, that has been handed down through the centuries–the pilgrims, in rows of four or five abreast and holding the ends of white handkerchiefs, \"dance\" or \"jump\" from left to right and thus slowly move forward. Because of the numbers of pilgrims attending, it is well after midday before the last of the dancers has reached the church. A large number of priests, nuns, and monks also accompany the procession, and not infrequently there are several bishops as well. On arrival at the church, the dance is continued past the tomb of Saint Willibrord, which stands in the crypt beneath the high altar. Litanies and prayers in the Saint's honour are recited, and the event concludes with a benediction of the sacrament.\n\nIn the past, the dancing procession has adopted other forms. At one stage the pilgrims would take three steps forward and two steps backwards, thus taking five steps in order to advance one; at another stage the pilgrims would repeatedly stop at the sound of the bell donated by Emperor Maximilian, falling to their knees before moving forward a few more steps. Again, pilgrims would crawl under a stone, facing the cross of St. Willibrord. A 'cattle-bell dance' used to take place in front of the cross, which was erected on the marketplace; this dance was prohibited in 1664.\n\nWillibrord's Abbey of Echternach was a major Christian centre in the Middle Ages, and maintained a famous library and scriptorium. However, it owes its modern fame to the quaint dancing procession. This aspect of the cult of the saint may be traced back almost to the date of his death; among the stream of pilgrims to his tomb in the abbey church have been Emperors Charlemagne, Lothair I, Conrad, and later Maximilian (in 1512).\n\nCatholic historians are reluctant to ascribe any pre-Christian antecedents to the dancing procession, and claim only that its origin cannot be stated with certainty. There might be elements of pagan cult, such as the ones that were criticised by Saint Eligius in the 7th century. Documents of the fifteenth century speak of it as a long-established custom at that time, and a similar \"dancing\" procession, which used to take place in the small town of Prüm, in the Eifel, was documented as early as 1342. Legends are told that relate the dancing procession to an averted plague or offer a fable about a condemned fiddler, but the dancing procession to the saint's tomb is an annual ceremony done as an act of penance on behalf of afflicted relations and especially in order to avert epilepsy, Saint Vitus Dance, or convulsions.\n\nThe procession took place annually without intermission until 1777. There has been an uneasy relationship with the church hierarchy; in 1777, the music and dancing of the 'dancing saints' were forbidden by Archbishop Wenceslas, who declared that there should only be a pilgrim's procession, and, in 1786, Emperor Joseph II abolished the procession altogether. Attempts were made to revive it ten years later, and, although the French Revolution effectually prevented it, it was recommenced in 1802, and has continued ever since. In 1826, the government tried to change the day to a Sunday, but, since 1830, it has always taken place on Whit Tuesday, a traditional day that, significantly, bears no direct relation to St. Willibrord himself.\n"}

By the late eighteenth century, with brilliant exceptions like Piranesi and Tiepolo, most etchings were reproductive or illustrative.\n\nHowever, in the 1840s and 50's in France, a number of artists did produce some landscape etchings which seemed to recapture some of the spirit of the Old Master print. Daubigny, Millet and especially Charles Jacque produced etchings that were different from those heavily worked reproductive plates of the previous century.\n\nSeveral people were of special importance to the French Etching Revival. The publisher Alfred Cadart, the printer Auguste Delâtre, and Maxime Lalanne, an etcher who wrote a popular textbook of etching in 1866, established the broad contours of the movement. Cadart founded the \"Société des Aquafortistes\" in 1862, reviving the awareness of the beautiful, original etching in the minds of the collecting public. Charles Méryon was an early inspiration, and close collaborator with Delâtre, laying out the various possible techniques of modern etching and producing works that would be ranked with Rembrandt and Dürer.\n\n\"A Treatise on Etching\" by Lalanne was translated by S.R. Koehler and published in the United States in 1880. It played a significant role in the Etching Revival in America. However, before the translation of Lalanne's book, Philip Gilbert Hamerton had become an enthusiastic promoter of etching in Britain. His \"Etching and Etchers\" (1868) was more an art history than a technical text but it did much to popularize the art and some of its modern practitioners. The book went through many editions till the 20th century. By the 1870s Hamerton was also publishing an influential periodical, titled \"The Portfolio\", that published etchings in editions of 1000 copies.\n\nFor Hamerton and others, the father of the British Etching Revival was Francis Seymour Haden, the surgeon etcher, who, with his brother-in-law, the American, James McNeill Whistler, produced a body of work starting around 1860 that still stands as one the highpoints of etching history. Haden was a collector and authority on the etchings of Rembrandt and it comes as no surprise that as Whistler, the younger man, began to show signs of veering far from the 17th-century model, Haden and he parted company.\n\nIt was Whistler who convinced the artist Alphonse Legros, one of the members of the French Revival, to come to England as a teacher. This linking of the art of the two countries, though short-lived, did much to validate etching as an art form. Very soon, French etching would show the same modernist signs that French art showed generally, while English and American etching remained true to the kind of technical proficiency and subject matter artists revered in Rembrandt. One distinct aspect of the revival, in contrast with the Old Master period, was an interest in giving unique qualities to each impression of a print.\n\nEtching as a collected and therefore as a practised art appears to have died with the Great Depression. Without a large group of collectors many artists returned to their canvases. Etchings fell hugely in value until the 1980s when a new market (albeit a small one) began to develop for what is now seen as a small but important tributary of the stream of 19th- and 20th-century art.\n\n"}

There are only two complete extant copies. One is part of the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC. The other is part of Special Collections at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nThe term \"false folio\" intentionally evokes the folio collections of Shakespeare's works that appeared later: the First Folio of 1623 and its three seventeenth-century successors. The description \"folio\" is not strictly accurate, since the ten plays were printed in a larger-than-usual quarto format, not in folio; but the key qualifier is \"false\" folio. The texts in question were first examined with modern bibliographic procedures primarily by Alfred W. Pollard, W. W. Greg, and William J. Neidig. Pollard provides a detailed account in his \"Shakespeare Folios and Quartos\".\n\nIn summary, the stationer and printer William Jaggard reprinted ten plays in 1619, either to be bound together in a single volume or issued separately depending on customer choice. Jaggard, however, did not have clear title to all of the plays involved [see: Stationers Company; Stationers' Register], and therefore he printed some of the texts with false dates and the names of the original stationers involved on the title pages – in effect reproducing the appearance of the earlier quartos. The ten plays were:\n\n\n\"Pericles\" was printed after \"The Whole Contention\", since their signatures (the alphanumeric designations of the quires in sequence) run together; but the nine plays were apparently bound together in no particular order. (The few existing collections vary.)\n\nAs Jaggard lacked rights to Hayes' \"Merchant of Venice\", he may also have lacked rights to Butter's \"Lear\" and Johnson's \"Merry Wives\". There is much about the False Folio affair that remains unclear, such as subjective questions of Jaggard's motivation. Jaggard had a previous odd connection with the Shakespeare canon: he had printed the questionable miscellany \"The Passionate Pilgrim\" as Shakespeare's in 1599 and 1612. Some Shakespeare scholars have wondered why the King's Men used Jaggard as the printer and one of the publishers of the First Folio, just a couple of years after the False Folio affair. (Work on the First Folio began almost certainly in 1621.) It may have been a case of necessity, since Jaggard had a large-capacity print shop. (He had demonstrated his ability to print a volume of ten plays.) Pavier's role in the matter is also debated; his initials occur on five of the nine volumes (six of the ten plays), and some contemporary commentators see Pavier's role as more significant than Jaggard's – referring to the books as the \"Pavier quartos\" instead of the \"False Folio.\"\n\nPollard focused much of his attention on the concept of literary \"piracy,\" and his viewpoint coloured much of the scholarly attitude and approach to the False Folio during the twentieth century. By the start of the twenty-first century, some researchers began to take a less melodramatic and more nuanced view of the questions involved, a view that no longer casts Jaggard and Pavier as the villains in a moral contest.\n\n"}

If Kickapoo is counted as a separate language rather than a dialect of Fox, then there are only between 200 and 300 speakers of Fox. Extinct Mascouten was most likely another dialect, though it is scarcely attested.\n\nMost speakers are elderly or middle-aged, making it highly endangered. The tribal school at the Meskwaki Settlement in Iowa incorporates bilingual education for children. In 2011, the Meskwaki Sewing Project was created, to bring mothers and girls together \"with elder women in the Meskwaki Senior Center sewing traditional clothing and learning the Meskwaki language.\"\n\nProminent scholars doing research on the language include Ives Goddard and Lucy Thomason of the Smithsonian Institution and Amy Dahlstrom of the University of Chicago.\n\nThe consonant phonemes of Fox are given in the table below. There are eight vowel phonemes: short and long .\n\nOther than those involving a consonant plus or , the only possible consonant cluster is .\n\nUntil the early 1900s, Fox was a phonologically very conservative language and preserved many features of Proto-Algonquian; records from the decades immediately following 1900 are particularly useful to Algonquianists for this reason. By the 1960s, however, an extensive progression of phonological changes had taken place, resulting in the loss of intervocalic semivowels and certain other features.\n\nBesides the Latin script, Fox has been written in two indigenous scripts.\n\n\"Fox I\" is an abugida based on the cursive French alphabet (see Great Lakes Algonquian syllabics).

{"id": "683097", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=683097", "title": "Grime's Graves", "text": "Grime's Graves\n\nGrime's Graves is a large Neolithic flint mining complex in Norfolk, England. It lies north east from Brandon, Suffolk in the East of England. It was worked between c. 2600 and c. 2300 BC, although production may have continued well into the Bronze and Iron Ages (and later) owing to the low cost of flint compared with metals. Flint was much in demand for making polished stone axes in the Neolithic period. Much later, when flint had been replaced by metal tools, flint nodules were in demand for other uses, such as for building and as strikers for muskets.\n\nThe scheduled monument extends over an area of some and consists of at least 433 shafts dug into the natural chalk to reach seams of flint. The largest shafts are more than deep and in diameter at the surface. It has been calculated that more than 2,000 tonnes of chalk had to be removed from the larger shafts, taking 20 men around five months, before stone of sufficient quality was reached. An upper 'topstone' and middle 'wallstone' seam of flint was dug through on the way to the deeper third 'floorstone' seam which most interested the miners. The site is managed by English Heritage and can be visited.\n\nThe site is also a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Geological Conservation Review site. It is part of the Breckland Special Area of Conservation and Special Protection Area.\n\nIn order to remove the chalk efficiently, the ancient miners built wooden platforms and ladders as they dug downwards and piled the spoil around the shaft opening using turf revetments to hold it in place for the season, when the shaft and all its galleries were thoroughly and fastidiously backfilled to promote stability. The landscape around Grime's Graves has a characteristic pockmarked appearance caused by the infilled shafts. This is probably what inspired the later Anglo-Saxon inhabitants of the area to name it after their god Grim (literally the masked, or hooded one, a euphemism for Woden). Although the pagan Anglo-Saxons seem to have had some idea of what the site was, as the name of the site means literally 'The masked one's quarries,' (or Grim's Graben,) it wasn't until Canon William Greenwell excavated one of the shafts from 1868- 1870 that their purpose was discovered in modern times. Other similar sites have been found in Europe like Cissbury in the United Kingdom, Krzemionki in Poland and Spiennes in Belgium.\n\nThe miners used picks fashioned from the antler of red deer. They probably used wooden shovels, although this is only inferred by analogy with other flint mines with better conditions for the preservation of artefacts. Analysis of the antlers (Clutton-Brock 1984: 25) has shown that the miners were mainly right-handed and favoured the left antlers out of those that were naturally shed seasonally by the deer. The 28 pits excavated up to 2008 yielded an average of 142.5 antler picks each, of which an average of 14.8 have been found to be left-handed.\n\nOnce they had reached the floorstone flint, the miners dug lateral galleries outwards from the bottom, following the flint seam. The medium-depth shafts yielded as much as 60 tons of flint nodules, which were brought to the surface and roughly worked into shape on site. The blank tools were then possibly traded elsewhere for final polishing. It is estimated that 60 tons of flint could have produced as many as 10,000 of the polished stone axes, which were the mines' main product. Extrapolation across the site suggests that Grime's Graves may have produced around 16-18,000 tonnes of flint across the 433 shafts recorded to date. However, there are large areas of the site covered by later activity which are believed to conceal many more mineshafts.\n\nThere were other hard stones used for axe manufacture, those of the Langdale axe industry and Penmaenmawr in North Wales being traded across Europe, as well as other less well-known igneous and metamorphic rocks. The axes were much in demand for forest clearance and settlement, development of farmland for arable crops and raising animals, which characterises the Neolithic period.\n\nOne unproductive shaft (pit 15) appears to have been turned into a shrine. An altar of flint lumps had been built with a chalk bowl at its base and antler picks piled around. In front of the altar had been placed a Venus figurine of chalk, a chalk phallus and some balls, also of chalk. It may have been an attempt to ensure that the mine remained productive or 'fertile' after this particular shaft turned out to have little flint in it. However, it is possible that the Venus figurine and the phallus are modern fakes – there is a lack of primary evidence surrounding their recovery in 1939, and rumours circulated at the time of the excavation that they were planted in order to deceive Leslie Armstrong, the archaeologist overseeing the dig.(Piggot 1986: 190, Longworth et al. 1991: 103-105).\n\nSuch a large industry may have required supporting infrastructure. Assuming no more than two shafts were open at any one time, around 120 red deer may have needed to be bred and managed nearby, in order to provide a steady supply of antler as well as skin, food and other products that the miners would require. Alternatively, the mines may have been worked intermittently by local farmers, as happened in many early metal mines during the Bronze Age and the later Iron Age.\n\nEarlier flint mines in Britain such as Cissbury in Sussex were just as important as Grime's Graves, and there were many very local sources of flint which were exploited on the downlands. However, it is probably relevant that Grime's Graves were close to the very rich soils of the Fens, and forest clearance here would rely on local products.\n\nThere was also extensive farming settlement during the Bronze Age, known from middens that infill the mouths of many Neolithic mineshafts. Animal bones from these middens show that the Bronze Age people kept cattle, which they milked, sheep and a few pigs. They also grew barley, wheat and peas.\n\nGrime's Graves is in the care of English Heritage. It is open to the public and it is possible to descend a ladder and explore one of the shafts. There is a small exhibition area. This is the only shaft of its kind open to the public in Britain.\n\nThe full English Heritage reports on the excavations at Grime's Graves in 1971-72 are now available online through the Archaeology Data Service. Doctor Philip Harding FSA, later to appear in the TV programme \"Time Team\", dug the site each summer from 1972 to 1976.\n\n\n\n"}

It grew from a tiny fishing hamlet in 1864 at the hands of an oyster fishery company, was developed from 1879 by land agents, abandoned in 1916 and finally drowned due to coastal erosion by 1921. All that now remains is the stub of the original pier, the Hampton Inn, and the rocky arc of Hampton-on-Sea's ruined coastal defence visible at low tide. The site is notable for sharing its history with the eccentric Edmund Reid. Reid was previously the Metropolitan Police head of CID who handled the Jack the Ripper case. In retirement he chose to champion the plight of the beleaguered residents of the settlement.\n\nToday Hampton, Herne Bay is the coastal west end of Herne Bay, Kent. The site of Hampton-on-Sea is now underwater due to coastal erosion, but it was on the west side of the northern end of Hampton Pier Avenue, between the 1959 sea defences and the remains of the sea wall which are exposed at low water in Hampton bay. When Hampton-on-Sea existed and until 1934, the Hampton-on-Sea site was under the jurisdiction of Blean Rural District Council, the boundary with Herne Bay Council running north-south along the line of the present-day Hampton Pier Avenue. In 1934, the area was transferred to Herne Bay Urban District Council, and in 1974 to Canterbury City Council.\n\nOn the sea-bed, offshore of this site, are remains of prehistoric and Roman activity. \"Hampton\" means \"home farm\", and before the development there were two farmhouses, a beerhouse, a few cottages containing the Mount and Quick fishing families, and the West Brook which was also known as Hampton Brook. The settlement had a reputation for a wild life, and Hill Farmhouse was said to have cellars or caves underneath for smuggling. Some cottages were built of old boats and wreckage; Hampton Farmhouse was then 300 yards from the sea and dated back to the 17th century. A low sea cliff made of soil edged the coast west of Hampton Pier, and coastal erosion was already an acknowledged problem for the farmers by 1836. Altogether the coastline at this site receded by in the years between the completion of Hampton Pier in 1865, and the start of construction of modern coastal defences in 1958. Sea floodings have been officially recorded on this coastline since the great storm of 1897.\n\nOysters had thrived in the Thames Estuary since the Romans promoted them; they were sold in city streets and eaten raw. The Herne Bay, Hampton and Reculver Oyster Fishery Company was incorporated with £10,000 capital in £10 shares on 25 July 1864 with Frank Buckland as chairman and Mr Cholmondeley Pennell as deputy. 1860–1864 had been a boom year for oyster farming, especially in nearby Whitstable, and the Government supported the trade in 1866 by passing an Act to promote cultivation. The company's proposals included five oyster smacks or yawls, a pier with storehouses, housing for workers and five freshwater breeding ponds. In spite of objections from local business competition, the company acquired an Act of Parliament and land at Hampton. According to the Act of 25 July 1864, the company had sole rights to dredge for oysters for seven miles (11 km) from Swalecliffe to Reculver and up to three miles (5 km) – but mainly one and a half miles – from shore. The total area under its jurisdiction was nine square miles, of which a third was foreshore, and it employed thirty-three regular men; sometimes up to a hundred. In 1865 and 1866 their chairman Cholmondeley Pennell applied unsuccessfully for extensions to these rights. Before selling the oysters dredged from the Estuary, the company obtained brood oysters from Essex, France, the Netherlands and Portugal. The smacks took the oysters twice a week on Tuesdays and Fridays to Billingsgate.\nThe company was successful at first, although stressed by underfunding and the cost of the pier, and by 1866 an enquiry commission stated: \"The Company have already cleared about five square miles, and culched about one square mile of their grounds, and have laid down on parts of their beds many millions of oysters\". However, as the company was still relatively new, they had not yet developed their oysters to quite the same market value as the long-established Whitstable ones. A sideline for the Hampton fishermen was cement stones, because they were found on the Hampton fishing grounds. These were boulders the size of a man's head, sold to manufacturers of Roman cement. There was a dispute with the rival Whitstable Oyster Company, and Whitstable was fined £1 per oyster taken from Hampton's grounds, while Hampton was accused of not fully exploiting its breeding ponds and of importing foreign oysters for resale. In 1869, local inshore fishermen complained that their traditional territory was now defended on the company's behalf by \"HMS Buzzard\" and that the company employed outsiders for long hours and low pay. In the 1870s the oyster trade went into decline and suffered over-fishing, and in 1876 the Government set up a select committee to enquire into scarcity and price. The result was the 1877 Act which prevented sale of dredged oysters in June to August, and freshwater pond oysters between May and August. In the following three severe winters, oysters died in the shallow Estuary waters and the company went into liquidation. The business passed into the hands of hotel owner Major Davis who closed it down when his operation went to Faversham. Company assets were sold on 20 July 1881 and it officially wound up in 1884.\n\nThe tramway began and ended with the oyster fishery from 1864 to 1884. So that cargo could begin its journey to Kent and London on a horse-tram, the tramway was built due south from the pier to the railway which had been built in 1861. This track, which was later to become Hampton Pier Avenue, was straightened at its northern end and raised above risk of flood for the tram. By 1866 the tracks were still not laid along the pier itself, but according to the OS map of 1878, it had been completed by then. At the southern end, the tramway curved westward, running beside Westbrook, and reached the railway line just east of the point where Westbrook crosses it, and to the west of where Hampton Close is today: see 1878 map, pictured. One Judah Downs won £900 in a dispute over land crossed by the tramway, and the company later bought him out as well. After the company went into liquidation, the tramway was removed in the 1880s. For much of the 20th century it was possible to see where the tramway reached the railway line.\n\nThomas Kyffin Freeman, owner of the \"Herne Bay Argus\", formed the Hampton-on-Sea Estate Association Limited in 1879 with £60,000 capital in £10 shares, but only sold 398 shares. He built a bandstand, built foundations for reading rooms and planned tennis courts, a miniature golf course, an archery green and a recreation ground. He organised a sports day with free teas and amusement rides, but too many visitors arrived and he ran out of teas. With builder Thomas Richard Geelong Hoe he planned a housing estate, and a Hampton-on-Sea nameboard was put up at Herne Bay railway station in expectation of this, but then he died in 1880. The company was eventually dissolved in 1905.\n\nFrederick Francis Ramuz, Mayor of Southend and land agent, bought the property cheaply. (today the Hampton Inn) became the Land Company's base for its administration of the of land it had bought altogether in Herne Bay. Planned street names which no longer exist were Swalecliffe Gardens, Hampton Grand Parade, Marine Drive, Canterbury Gardens, Hampton Gardens, Eddington Gardens next to Hampton Farmhouse and Herncliffe Gardens incorporating the oyster fishery's Hampton Terrace. The company proposed a genteel resort with large brick bungalows and villas, a temperance hotel plus church, and shops plus tavern. Freeman's idea for a recreation ground was resurrected for good measure.\nRamuz divided the \"Grand Parade Estate at Hampton-on-Sea\" into 124 development plots for the first auction on 17 September 1888 \"to suit all classes\" and set up a sales marquee onsite. Cheap, refundable train fares and a free lunch were promised to prospective purchasers. All the plots were sold within one and a half hours after the buyers, mostly from London, were serenaded by the Buffs 3rd Battalion band during their free lunch. Plots facing the sea made £18, and those at the back £8 to £9, with the old farmhouse making £100 and the tavern plot £39: all moneys were payable in instalments. The Land Company made £2,000.\n\nBy the date of the second marquee-auction of 126 more plots, the Land Company had built roads and was repairing the pier. Plots were advertised more energetically than before and promoted on the basis of Herne Bay's smallness, cheapness, ripeness for speculation and its proximity to the railway line. Sales were aimed at landlords wanting to buy cheaply and rent at profit, because at that time house-ownership was uncommon and tenancy was the norm. Prospective purchasers were promised trams and buses to take tenants to the railway station, or even an extra railway station close to the estate. The empty and rural nature of this spot was translated into promises of botanising, shooting, bathing, sailing and angling. Although no cheap train was provided on this occasion, plots sold at £8 to £32, making the Land Company £1,370. During 1889 sales were promoted by newspaper advertisements rather than auctions, and the pier's repairs were said to be ongoing. According to these advertisements there were croquet lawns and tennis courts plus a spring.\n\nA third sale of 144 plots took place on 7 July 1890 making £2,450 for the Land Company, and events included a regatta with a coastguards' race and pair-oared rowing race, plus a traditional \"duck hunt\" in which a man acts as duck. The fourth and final auction of 124 plots on 28 July 1890 promised yet another special train from London and the opportunity to buy the shop plots and more villa plots. Four shop plots went for £54, villa plots for £3 to £7, and we are not told the sum earned by the company. Some plots remained unsold, and these were advertised throughout 1891. Following the four auctions and three years of advertising, very few plots were developed, and the temperance hotel, church, shops and tavern were never built.\n\nHampton pier was built of wood and concrete by the oyster company in 1865 at cost of £28,000; it was long so that the landing stage was in deep enough water to allow for the two-fathom draught of the smacks. It curved slightly westwards to allow the company's oyster smacks and European oyster trading boats to berth on the lee side in a north-easterly wind. Its purpose was threefold: a landing stage for oysters and materials, a shelter for the oyster smacks and a breakwater for fishing grounds. The Lord Mayor of London Thomas Gabriel arrived in a special train to open it on 15 September 1866. After the collapse of the oyster fishery, the pier was said to be under repair by land agent Frederick Francis Ramuz in October 1888. Thereafter, the pier became derelict. In the great storm of 28–29 November 1897 it was badly damaged, and then partially demolished in 1898 to halt erosion and save the houses of Hampton-on-Sea. In 1901, the Council bought it and at a cost of £2,000 the Surveyor to the Council F.W.J. Palmer rebuilt the stub in 1903–1904 as it is today, at long. The remaining piles and ruins of the old pier were a shipping hazard and had to be buoyed with large warning notices.\n\nThe cause of the erosion and flooding which eventually drowned this development was the original Hampton Pier. The ebb and flow of tidal streams is powerful in the shallow Thames Estuary, where its tidal waters are caught in the vortex of the tidal push from Atlantic waters via both the north and south of the British Isles. Off Herne Bay, the running ebb current moves at 10.15 knots, and the flow at . Where strong currents meet and divide, or are disrupted by uneven coastal features, there are eddies. After Hampton Pier was first built, the flow running west along Herne Bay beach dropped its sand and pebbles on the east side of the pier instead of replenishing beach material in front of the new development. Subsequently, after being forced into a loop around the pier-end it was possibly forced into a shoreward eddy by deep-water currents. That means that at a certain point in the flow-tide it could have continued briefly westward past Hampton-on-Sea, then turned inshore and looped back strongly eastwards along the beach towards Hampton Pier Avenue, eroding land at Hampton-on-Sea and then turning north along Hampton Pier Avenue and the pier, carrying soil with it. It is said that the later shortening of the pier was not enough and that erosion will continue, so such an eddy may explain the need for today's shore defences along the north end of Hampton Pier Avenue. An additional possibility is related to the strong ebb flow's history of removing the headlands of Herne Bay's original bay before the 19th century. This current moving east, being baulked and turned north suddenly by the new sea defences of Hampton Pier Avenue and Hampton Pier, might easily erode the little Hampton-on-Sea bay in default of the Hampton Pier headland. Both the above theories allow for scoured coastal material to be removed to deeper waters to the north of Hampton-on-Sea by the ebb tide and by the occasional eddy, besides being dropped at Long Rock by an alternate normal east-west flow tide. When there are exceptional conditions on top of these tidal streams, for example a low pressure system causing higher water level coinciding with strong north-westerly winds, coastal flooding can occur.\n\nHampton Brook, now Westbrook, reached the sea through a stone culvert but seaweed often blocked it, making it overflow and become stagnant. The land between the houses and the often-foetid Hampton Brook was low-lying enough to be subject to flood during a combination of spring tide, prolonged rainfall and onshore wind. Either the digging or the filling-in of the oyster company's fishpools created soft, unstable land.\n\nHampton Terrace was built for the oyster company's workers in 1866, and it later became part of Herncliffe Gardens which no longer exists. The Hampton Oyster Inn, today the Hampton Inn, was built by a brewer opposite the pier entrance. Only eight plots bought from the Land Company were developed: Hampton Terrace in Herncliffe Gardens was extended by three villas; four villas were built in Eddington Gardens alongside the old Hampton Farmhouse; lastly Pleasant Cottage, later called Hampton Bungalow, was built in Swalecliffe Avenue in the late 1890s. Of the roads and plots created by the Land Company, only Swalecliffe Avenue and Hampton Pier Avenue survive today. Wave damage in the great storm of 28–29 November 1897 damaged the three Herncliffe Garden houses, and brought coastal erosion closer to the properties. In 1899, a wall of faggots and four groynes were ineffectual against the onset of the sea. John Davis and W.H. Banks abandoned numbers One and Two Herncliffe Gardens in July 1899, while numbers Three to Twelve remained tenanted until at least 1902, and in 1899–1900 a sea wall was built to protect the houses. By 1901 number Three had been abandoned, though officially listed as occupied, and the high-water mark had reached the corner of number One. By 1905 Hampton Grand Parade and half of Marine Drive had been eroded away, then a storm broke through the sea wall and scoured out the land from behind it. In spite of having had to buy back land from worried investors, the Land Company continued to advertise empty houses in Herncliffe Gardens for sale. By 1910 the two seaward-end houses had been demolished, and by the end of 1911 all twelve houses of Herncliffe Gardens terrace were abandoned and then demolished with the sea at the back doors. In 1916, Eddington Gardens was abandoned by its last resident, Edmund Reid. By the 1920s only Hampton Farmhouse and numbers One and Two Eddington Gardens were left of Hampton-on-Sea, and the latter two were demolished in 1921. It is at that point that Hampton-on-Sea is said to have been finally drowned. In 1934, the old farmhouse was the last to go.\n\n(b. 1846; d. Herne Bay 5 December 1917) In 1903, Edmund James Reid moved into number Four, Eddington Gardens: the house at the landward end of the terrace, previously advertised for £300. At that point the sea was still about two hundred yards away. He had retired in 1896 or 1898, having been head of CID in the Metropolitan police, and his most famous case was the Whitechapel murders in 1888. He named his house \"Reid's Ranch\", painted castellations and cannon on its side and soon became known as the eccentric champion of the beleaguered Hampton-on-Sea residents. His house contained a parrot and many photographs of his London cases. His garden contained a cannonball found on his property, a post from the end of the old pier and a flagpole with a union flag. From a wooden kiosk in his garden named the \"Hampton-on-Sea Hotel\" he sold soft drinks and postcards featuring himself and the fast-vanishing remains of Hampton-on-Sea. Some of these were photographed by Fred C. Palmer of Herne Bay, who was the \"Herne Bay Press\" photographer for all big events. The stagnant Hampton Brook became a butt of Reid's jokes and he renamed it \"Lavender Brook\", sending sardonic letters to the Council about erosion, Hampton Brook, public facilities and the pier as shipping hazard. With two neighbours he built a bridge over the brook, but it was declared dangerous and demolished by the Council. The sea flowed closer to his property, and in 1915 he was the last remaining resident of Eddington Gardens and of Hampton-on-Sea. He abandoned his house in 1916, moved to Herne Bay, married in 1917 and died aged 71 on 5 December of the same year. He was buried in Herne Bay Cemetery in plot S62 on 8 December 1917.\n\nBy the 1920s and 30s on the higher land of Hampton, the first houses on Hampton Pier Avenue and Swalecliffe Avenue were being built; this time as a suburb of Herne Bay. Houses eventually filled Hampton Hill to the east of Hampton Pier Avenue, and Studd Hill to the south of the Hampton-on-Sea site. From 1929 to 1966 there was a boating lake in place of the landward oyster pond; it is now a playground. Besides the stub of Hampton Pier and the Hampton Inn, the curved shape of the Land Company's 1900 sea wall, visible at low tide, is all that is left of Hampton-on-Sea. From the 1990s to 2005 this object, known as \"The Rocks\", was considered a shipping hazard, mainly with respect to the jetskiers who ignored and vandalised safety notices about jetskiing near The Rocks. Some chunks of it were removed by contractors until local objections prevented further loss of this landmark which now shelters rockpools, mussels and feeding birds. The coast was conserved in 1959 to 1960 with a new sea defence, and in the same years the landscaping that followed a cliff drainage scheme running down from the Studd Hill estate replaced sea poppies and summer crickets with lawn.\n\nWhere Herncliffe Gardens and Eddington Gardens stood, there is now the 1959 sea wall, beach and undersea mud. Knowledge of what had existed there persisted mostly in the mythology of local children, until in the 1990s an information board featuring a picture of Reid was erected beside the Pier. A Council Oyster Bay Trail cycle route, planned in 2009, is named after the area's history. Today there is an established walking route along the 1959 coastal defence; it is part of the Saxon Shore Way. The committee for Herne Bay Festival 2008 agreed a cross-marketing strategy with Whitstable Oyster Festival, thus recognising the history of dredging off Herne Bay by the oyster fisheries working from Hampton-on-Sea in the 19th century. There is still a very small fleet of day fishing boats operating offshore of the Hampton area, and landing on the beach at Herne Bay.\n\nCoastal erosion at Hampton-on-Sea has been estimated at per annum between the construction of the old Hampton Pier in 1865 to 1959 when the Council built the sea wall. The direction and rate of influential currents is unknown, but it is calculated that of coastal sediment per annum is scoured by the sea from the Hampton-on-Sea coast and deposited to the west at Long Rock, Swalecliffe. This area with a defensive frontage of is now known as the Hampton Flood Basin and Hampton Brook, now officially Westbrook, is still prone to floodlocking, as occurred in 2001. Although the 1959 sea wall and groynes were updated in 1983, and Hampton Pier Avenue's rock armour revetment was upgraded in 1994, it is thought that eventually the sea defences would need to be raised. Nevertheless, although sea-damage was done by the great 1953 and 1978 storms, the upgraded defences protected this coast from the severe 1996 storm. Costs of increasing flood defences here are estimated at £1–7 million, especially as the work has to be modified because this area is a SSSI and SPA. Cost and limitations meant that a short-term solution of £635,000 capital works was recommended by the Council Steering Group on 29 June 2009 to be implemented from winter 2011 to spring 2011. The recommendation was to hold the line with replacement and improvement of six timber groynes, importing a new beach of partly taken from Long Rock, raising and extending the rear wall and closing off openings with floodgates. Beach replenishment and groyne replanking would continue at intervals.\n\nWill Scott's 1955 children's novel \"Half Term trail\" is set partly in Hampton-on-Sea under the fictional name of West Bay, and it features Pleasant Cottage (later called Hampton Bungalow; then Stillwaters) in Swalecliffe Avenue under the name of Dilly Dally cottage. Hampton's cliffs before the erection of the 1959 defences are described thus: \n\"The first cliffs in West Bay are hardly cliffs at all. It's where the stream runs out across the beach, and you can stand on the sands and look over the edge of the cliffs without even standing on your toes. Farther along the cliffs are higher and crumbly and falling into the sea all the time, which was one reason why nobody wanted to buy Dilly Dally. A few more years and it would be in the sea along with the cliff.\"\n\n\n"}

Over twenty countries or groups of countries where English is the first language or an official second language are included.\n\nSidney Greenbaum's goal to compile corpora that would compare the syntax of world English became the ICE project that was achieved by Professor Charles F. Meyer. Sidney Greenbaum anticipated for international teams of researchers to collect comparable national variations of English both written and spoken. Comparable variations would be British English, American English, and Indian English, that would be represented through a computer corpora. The corpora are used by researchers to compare the syntax of the varieties of English. ICE corpora completion would have comprehensive linguistic analysis of varieties of English that have emerged. Ongoing research for ICE is implemented by international teams in diversified regions. The project began in 1990 with the primary aim of collecting material for comparative studies of English worldwide. Twenty-three research teams around the world are preparing electronic corpora of their own national or regional variety of English. Each ICE corpus consists of one million words of spoken and written English produced after 1989. For most participating countries, the ICE project is stimulating the first systematic investigation of the national variety. To ensure compatibility among the component corpora, each team is following a common corpus design, as well as a common scheme for grammatical annotation.\n\nEach corpus contains one million words in 500 texts of 2000 words, following the sampling methodology used for the Brown Corpus. Unlike Brown or the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen (LOB) Corpus (or indeed mega-corpora such as the British National Corpus), however, the \"majority\" of texts are derived from spoken data.\n\nWith only one million words per corpus, ICE corpora are considered very small for modern standards. ICE corpora are contain 60% (600,000 words) of orthographically transcribed \"spoken\" English. The father of the project, Sidney Greenbaum, insisted on the primacy of the spoken word, following Randolph Quirk and Jan Svartvik's collaboration on the original London-Lund Corpus (LLC). This emphasis on word-for-word transcription marks out ICE from many other corpora, including those containing, e.g. parliamentary or legal paraphrases.\n\nThe corpora consist entirely of data from 1990 or later. The subjects from which the data was collected are all adults who were educated in English and were either born, or moved at an early age, to the country to which their data is attributed. There are speech and text samples from both men and women of many age groups, but the corpus website makes it a point to note that, \"The proportions, however, are not representative of the proportions in the population as a whole: women are not equally represented in professions such as politics and law, and so do not produce equal amounts of discourse in these fields.\"\n\nThe British Component of ICE, ICE-GB, is fully parsed with a detailed Quirk \"et al.\" phrase structure grammar, and the analyses have been thoroughly checked and completed. This analysis includes a part-of-speech tagging and parsing of the entire corpus. The treebank can be thoroughly searched and explored with the \"ICE Corpus Utility Program\" or \"ICECUP\" software. More information is in the handbook.\n\nTo ensure compatibility between the individual corpora in ICE, each team is following a common corpus design, as well as a common scheme for grammatical annotation. Many corpora are currently available for download on the ICE official webpage, though some require a license. Others, however, are not ready for publication.\n\nResearchers and Linguists follow specific guidelines when annotating data for the corpus, which can be found here, in the International Corpus of English Manuals and Documentation. The three levels of annotation are Text Markup, Wordclass Tagging, Syntactic Parsing.\n\nOriginal markup and layout such as sentence and paragraph parsing is preserved, with special markers indicating it as original. Spoken data is transcribed orthographically, with indicators for hesitations, false starts, and pauses.\n\nWord Classes, also called Parts of Speech, are grammatical categories for words based upon their function in a sentence.\n\nBritish texts are automatically tagged for wordclass by the ICE tagger, developed at University College London, which uses a comprehensive grammar of the English language.\n\nAll other languages are tagged automatically using the PENN Treebank and the CLAWS tagset. While the tags are not corrected manually, they are checked regularly for quality.\n\nThe sentence are parsed automatically and, if necessary, are manually corrected with ICECUP, a syntax tree editor created specifically for the corpus.\n\nDependency parsing is also done automatically with the Dependency Parser Pro3GreS. The results are not manually verified.\n\nIreland is currently the only participant country who includes pragmatic annotation in their data.\n\nBelow are the subsections of the ICE, with the number of corpora for each category and sub-category in parentheses.\n\nThere are a number of books published about the International Corpus of English, as well as books based in part on the corpora.\n\n\nThe current list of participant countries are (*= available):\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1708493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1708493", "title": "José Argüelles", "text": "José Argüelles\n\nJosé Argüelles, born Joseph Anthony Arguelles (; January 24, 1939 – March 23, 2011), was an American New Age author and artist. He was the founder of Planet Art Network and the Foundation for the Law of Time. He held a Ph.D. in Art History and Aesthetics from the University of Chicago and taught at numerous colleges, including Princeton University, the University of California, Davis, the San Francisco Art Institute, and Evergreen State College. As one of the originators of the Earth Day concept (due in part to the influence of astrologer Dane Rudhyar), Argüelles founded the first Whole Earth Festival in 1970, at Davis, California. He is best known for his leading role in organizing the 1987 Harmonic Convergence event, for inventing (with the assistance of his wife Lloydine) the perpetual Dreamspell calendar in 1992, and for the central role that he played in the emergence of the 2012 phenomenon. Towards the end of his life, Argüelles focused on issue of consciousness, elaborating the concept of a noosphere (based on the work of Teilhard de Chardin and Vladimir Vernadsky) as a global work of art. Specifically, he envisioned a \"rainbow bridge\" encircling the Earth.\n\nArgüelles' father, Enrique Garcia Arguelles, was born in Jalisco, Guadalajara, Mexico to Sabino Garcia Arguelles and Maria Gomez Marquez. His mother, Ethel Pearl Martin, was born to Martin John Meyer and Laura Olga Hein in Potsdam, Minnesota. Joseph Anthony (Jose) Arguelles and his twin brother Ivan W. Arguelles were born in Rochester, Minnesota on January 24, 1939. José (born Joseph) was the twin brother of the poet Ivan Argüelles and the uncle of the linguist Alexander Argüelles. José Argüelles married twice and was the father of two children, Josh and Tara, by his first wife, writer and artist Miriam Tarcov. His second wife was Lloydine Burri. After concluding his teaching career in California, Argüelles lived in Boulder, Colorado, Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, and Ashland, Oregon. In the year 1999 he met Stephanie South who became his biographer.\n\nArgüelles' principal teacher and mentor was the unconventional Tibetan Buddhist and former monk Chögyam Trungpa, with whom he studied at Naropa University (then the Naropa Institute) in the mid-1970s. Astrologer Dane Rudhyar was also one of Argüelles' most influential mentors.\n\nArgüelles cited several Native American and New Age influences, among them Hopi elders Dan Katchongva and Thomas Banyacya and Lakota medicine man Arvol Looking Horse as well as part-Cheyenne author Frank Waters; part-Lakota, former Mormon, Beat Generation poet Tony Shearer; Anishinaabe spiritual leader Vincent La Duke (a.k.a. Sun Bear); Chuluaqui Quodoushka founder Harley Reagan; Brooke \"Medicine Eagle\" Edwards; and Diane Fisher (a.k.a. Dhyani Ywahoo).\n\nArgüelles' significant intellectual influences included Theosophy and the writings of Carl Jung and Mircea Eliade.\n\nLater in his life, Argüelles adopted the \"Banner of Peace\" from a design created by the Russian painter, explorer, and mystic Nicholas Roerich to accompany the adoption of the Roerich Pact for protecting cultural properties during wartime.\n\nAs a painter and visual artist, he provided illustrations for numerous books, as well as mural paintings at different universities. However, his scope as an artist included his education as an Art History Professor, and his views on art as a \"psychophysical aesthetic\" can be found in his doctoral dissertation \"Charles Henry and the Formation of a Psychophysical Aesthetic\" (Chicago University Press, 1972). When teaching as an untenured assistant professor at the University of California, Davis, one of his final exams to his students was to create \"something they believed in\" - this became a living art event which eventually became the basis for the annual Whole Earth Festival, still held today at the University of California, Davis. After experimenting with LSD in the mid-1960s, Argüelles produced a series of psychedelic art paintings that Humphrey Osmond—who originally coined the word \"psychedelic\"—named these \"The Doors of Perception\" (after Aldous Huxley's 1954 book of the same name, itself a title drawn from William Blake's early 19th-century work \"Milton a Poem\"). In a 2002 interview, Argüelles says of his artwork, \"as fantastic as painting was, it was a limited medium in terms of audience.\"\n\nArgüelles viewed his role as a visionary, saying \"My job as a visionary is to envision the best possible outcome for humanity.\" He dedicated much of his life to promoting an alternative calendar based on a cycle of 13 months of 28 days each, which he believed would help bring about world peace. He coined the slogan \"Time is Art\" for the Planetary Art Network (PAN) slogan, suggesting that time is a vehicle for our creative experience.\n\nJosé Argüelles was the principal organizer of the Harmonic Convergence event on August 16–17, 1987, said to have been the first globally synchronized meditation event. It focused on dates that had been identified by Tony Shearer in his book \"Lord of the Dawn\" (1971), a collection of poems in honor of the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl (associated with the planet Venus) and describing major cycles of time. Argüelles' \"The Mayan Factor: Path Beyond Technology\" (1987), was published in conjunction with the Harmonic Convergence. In it, Argüelles described a numerological system combining elements taken from the pre-Columbian Maya calendar with the \"I Ching\" and elements of shamanism. These were interspersed with parallel concepts drawn from modern sciences such as \"genetic codes\" and \"galactic convergences\". The book popularized the concept of Hunab Ku, associating the Colonial Maya concept of \"One God\" with an Aztec design from a woven rug Argüelles had obtained in a marketplace in Oaxaca, Mexico.\n\nArgüelles (who called himself Valum Votan), working together with his wife Lloydine (a.k.a. Bolon Ik), produced a calendar and divination system \"Dreamspell: The Journey of Timeship Earth 2013\" and a game/tool \"Telektonon: The Talking Stone of Prophecy.\" The former, based on the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar with special emphasis on the 260-day \"tzolk'in\" count, was the source of Argüelles' 13 Moon/28 Day Calendar. This calendar begins on July 26 (heliacal rising of the star Sirius) and runs for 364 days. The remaining date, July 25, is celebrated in some quarters as the \"Day out of Time/Peace through Culture Festival\". - celebrated in over 90 countries around the world. Argüelles attributed the origins of the calendar to \"Galactic Mayas,\" who he believed were ancient astronauts that had visited the ancient Mayas and taught them elements of civilization. One of their leaders was an individual he called Pacal Votan, known to Mayanists as K'inich Janaab' Pakal, who was buried in an elaborate tomb at the site of Palenque. (\"Telektonon\" was Argüelles' term for a stone speaking tube in the pyramid where Pakal is entombed.)\n\nIn \"Time and the Technosphere\" (2002), Argüelles devises and promotes a notion that he calls the \"Law of Time\", in part framed by his interpretations of how Maya calendrical mathematics functioned. In this notional framework Argüelles claims to have identified a \"fundamental law\" involving two timing frequencies: one he calls \"mechanised time\" with a \"12:60 frequency\", and the other \"natural [time] codified by the Maya [that is] understood to be the frequency 13:20\". To Argüelles, \"the irregular 12-month [Gregorian] calendar and artificial, mechanised 60-minute hour\" is a construct that artificially regulates human affairs, and is out-of-step with the natural \"synchronic order\". He proposes the universal abandonment of the Gregorian calendar and its replacement with a thirteen moon, 28 day calendar, in order to \"get the human race back on course\" by the adoption of this calendar of perfect harmony so the human race could straighten its mind out again.\"\n\nSome critics claim Argüelles co-opts an ancient tradition by recasting it in New Age terms, but he explained that his tools and calendar were not intended to be the same as the Maya calendar. Argüelles' approach is actually a form of syncretism. Many of Dreamspell's influences come from non-Maya sources, such as the 13-month/28-day calendar, a magic square devised by Benjamin Franklin, the \"I Ching\", numerology, and assorted mystical and pseudoarchaeological works such as Erich von Däniken's \"Chariots of the Gods?\" (1970), which emphasizes theories of ancient astronauts. Argüelles' calendar is based on a different day-count than the traditional Maya calendar. For example, in the traditional count January 1, 2005 is 5 \"Muluk\", while in the Dreamspell it is 2 \"Etznab\". This is attributed to a change of 52 days in the count that Argüelles made to accommodate a \"Time Shift' in 1992. As mathematician Michael Finley notes:\n\nSince the 365 day Maya haab makes no provision for leap years, its starting date in the Gregorian Calendar advances by one day every four years. The beginning of Argüelles' year is fixed to July 26. Thus his count of days departs from the haab as it was known to Maya scribes before the Spanish conquest. Argüelles claims that the Thirteen Moon Calendar is synchronized with the calendar round. Clearly, it is not.\n\nArgüelles' 13 Moon Calendar with a July 26 new year maintained the same symmetrical cross-referencing of year bearers the ancient Maya used. The first day of the year in both the 13 Moon Calendar and the Maya's Haab always begins on one of only four glyphs, called year bearers. In the Mayan calendar the first day of the year on the Haab consistently corresponds with one of four glyphs derived from the tzolk'in, called \"year bearers.\" The year-bearer glyph from the tzolk'in is used to identify the character of the 365-day year that follows. In this way the \"tzolk'in\" and \"haab'\" are continuously cross-patterned with each other in an ongoing matrix, but fully synchronize only once in 52 years.\n\nIn defense Argüelles has stated that the 13 moon 28 day synchronometer (calendar) is \"correct and biologically accurate for the whole planet.\" \n\nArgüelles co-founded the Planet Art Network (PAN) with Lloydine in 1983 as an autonomous, meta-political, worldwide peace organization engaging in art and spirituality. Active in over 90 countries, PAN identifies the Roerich Pact and has adopted its associated Banner of Peace as a symbol for \"Peace Through Culture\".\n\nThe Planet Art Network operates as a network of self-organized collectives, centralized by a shared focus of promoting the worldwide adoption of Argüelles' Dreamspell 13-Moon/28 day Calendar. The network upholds the slogan \"Time is Art\", suggesting that time is a vehicle for our creative experience, instead of the familiar saying \"Time is Money\".\n\nThe British anthropologist Will Black conducted research into Jose's Arguelles' Planet Art Network for several years. In his book \"Beyond the End of the World: 2012 and Apocalypse\" (2010), Black documents a general loss of interest in Dreamspell and in PAN in recent years.

She is a foundational theorist of social construction of gender difference and has played a vital role in the formation and transformation of gender studies. She has more recently called for a de-gendering of the social world.\n\nLorber was actively involved in Sociologists for Women in Society from the early 1970s. She developed and taught some of the first courses in the sociology of gender, women's studies, and feminist theory at Brooklyn College and the Graduate School, where she was the first Coordinator of the Women's Studies Certificate Program in 1988–1991. She was Chair of the ASA Sex and Gender Section in 1992–93 and was awarded the Jessie Bernard Award in 1996 “in recognition of scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society.”\n\nJudith Lorber was born in Brooklyn New York where she attended public elementary and high school. She graduated from Queens College, CUNY in 1952, and received an M.A. and Ph.D. from New York University in 1971. She started developing and teaching courses in women’s studies in 1972, and taught at Fordham University in the Bronx and at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate School until she retired from teaching in 1995. She lives in New York/NY. She is the sister of artist Stephen Lorber (born 1943).\n\nThe main perspective of Lorber’s work has been social construction—the idea that in social interaction, people produce their identities and statuses, and at the same time, reproduce the structure and constraints of their social world. This perspective analyzes illnesses as social states in which norms and expectations for behavior while ill emerge from the interaction of patients and health-care workers with each other and with family members, friends, and co-workers. Lorber’s next research project (with Roberta Satow) was interviewing psychiatric residents, social workers, and indigenous paraprofessionals in a ghetto community mental health center on issues of cultural congruity with patients and the stratification of prestige and work assignments.\n\nJudith Lorber’s last work on gender and health care, \"Gender and the Social Construction of Illness\", was published in 1997 as part of the Gender Lens series. A second edition, which she co-authored with Lisa Jean Moore, was published by Rowman and Littlefield in 2002. The book shows that because gender is embedded in the economy, the family, politics, and the medical and legal systems, it is a major factor in the behavior of patients and health care professionals. She also co-authored \"Gendered Bodies: Feminist Perspectives\" with Lisa Jean Moore. The first edition was published by Roxbury in 2007, and the second edition by Oxford University Press in 2011. The overall perspective is that of the transformation of the body through gendered social practices.\n\nHer work on women physicians, which culminated in \"Women Physicians: Careers, Status, and Power\", published in 1984, as well as a series of papers published from 1981 to 1987, was a logical combination of her feminism and medical sociology. In it, she showed how the difficulties women physicians encountered in their career advancement when compared to a matched sample of men physicians were the result of the processes of sponsorship and patronage in the informal organization of the medical profession. She thus expanded the analysis of the informal structure of the medical profession, which had been applied only to men physicians, to women, who were, at that point, entering medical school in large numbers.\n\nOne of the physicians that Lorber met in the course of her work on women physicians, Florence Haseltine, set her on the road to her next research project—on patient's experiences with one of the new procreative technologies -- in vitro fertilization (IVF), doctor-assisted conception. The research she conducted with Lakshmi Bandlamudi and Dorothy Greenfeld found that couples shaped their experiences through their behavior with clinic staff and other caretakers and with each other, creating meaning and some sense of control for themselves. Judith Lorber applied a feminist analysis to the growing use of IVF in male infertility, where the woman is fertile but the man isn’t. This situation sets the stage for marital bargaining, in which the woman seemingly is in a strong position, but which turns out to the man's advantage because of his dominance in the gender politics of the family. The feminist, ethical, and medical implications of this research were explored in papers published in the late 1980s.\n\nLorber’s feminism (and love of science fiction thinking) appeared in print as early as 1975 in \"Beyond Equality of the Sexes: The Question of the Children,\" followed by \"Dismantling Noah's Ark\" in 1986. In 1987, she became the Founding Editor of Gender & Society, the official publication of Sociologists for Women in Society(SWS). As a hands-on editor, Judith Lorber shaped the papers, the linguistic style, and the emerging themes. The journal was (and still is) extremely successful and is the main source of SWS’s current finances. She and Susan Farrell edited the first Gender & Society reader, \"The Social Construction of Gender\", published in 1991.\n\nBy 1990, Lorber made a significant contribution to gender studies by writing her own book that has since then become a bible and mandatory reading in women’s studies classes. \"Paradoxes of Gender\", published by Yale in 1994, contends that sex, sexuality, and gender are all socially constructed but that gender is the overarching category—a major social status that organizes almost all areas of social life. Therefore, bodies and sexuality are gendered—biology, physiology, and sexuality do not add up to gender, which is a social institution that establishes patterns of expectations for individuals, orders the social processes of everyday life, is built into the major social organizations of society, and is also an entity in and of itself. Lorber's theoretical approach to gender is masterful and unusual by mainstream empirical social science standards. \"Paradoxes\" has been translated into Italian and German and has influenced a generation of graduate students in the United States and other countries. The first chapter, “Night to His Day: The Social Construction of Gender,” has been widely anthologized, as has a paper based on the second chapter, “Believing is Seeing: Biology as Ideology.” The book has impacted not only sociology, but also the fields of anthropology, history, social psychology, sociolinguistics, men's studies, culture studies, and even law.\n\n\"Gender Inequalities: Feminist Theories and Politics\" was first published in 1998 by Roxbury and is now in its fifth edition, published by Oxford University Press in 2012. It sums up the last 35 years of feminist thought. \"Revisioning Gender\", which she co-edited with Beth Hess and Myra Marx Ferree, was published by Sage in 1999. It is a collection of original essays in different areas of social research that have been changed by the use of gender as a conceptual framework. She co-edited the \"Handbook of Gender and Women’s Studies\", published by Sage UK in 2006 with Mary Evans and Kathy Davis.\n\nLorber’s current work is to go “beyond.” In \"Beyond the Binaries: Depolarizing the Categories of Sex, Sexuality, and Gender,\" published in Sociological Inquiry in 1996, she argued that sociological data would be more accurate if it used more than the two polarized categories of sex, sexuality, and gender. In “Crossing Borders and Erasing Boundaries: Paradoxes of Identity Politics,” published in Sociological Focus in 1999, she pulled apart racial and transgender categories. In fact, Judith Lorber has gone so far as to argue that we should imagine a social world that is not organized by gender. She explored this idea in “Using Gender to Undo Gender: A Feminist Degendering Movement, ” published in Feminist Theory in 2000. \"Breaking the Bowls: Degendering and Social Change\" puts together all the “beyond” ideas and asks us to imagine a world without gender. It was published in 2005 by W.W. Norton.\n\nAt the 2012 American Sociological Association Annual Meetings, held in Denver, the theme was “utopias.” Judith Lorber gave an invited presentation at the opening plenary: “Gender Equality: Utopian and Realistic.” She also presented an invited paper, “Toward a World Beyond Gender: A Utopian Vision,” with Barbara J. Risman and Jessica Holden Sherwood. Recently, she has written and given presentations about the heroine of the popular Stieg Larsson trilogy -- “The Gender Ambiguity of Lisbeth Salander: Third-wave Feminist Hero?”\n\nJudith Lorber is published in Chapter 3 of \"The Gendered Society Reader,\" an anthology edited by Michael S. Kimmel; Amy Aronson; and Amy Kaler, with a text titled “Believing Is Seeing: Biology as Ideology.”\n\nIn the text, Lorber discusses the social constructs built into our society differentiating the genders. Lorber argues that “bodies differ in many ways physiologically; but they are completely transformed by social practices to fit into the salient categories of a society, the most pervasive of which are ‘female’ and ‘male and ‘women’ and ‘men’\". Moreover, Lorber points out that though the physiological differences of the sexes are there, each individual body does not always fit into its own category and “neither sex nor gender are pure categories”. Lorber exemplifies this by separating the genders and discussing differences within the separate ‘female’ and ‘male’ categories; she argues some women do not have ovaries and uteri, menopause differentiates menstruating women for those who do not, some men lactate, and some men cannot produce sperm. As she discusses the blurred lines surrounding individual bodies within their gender categories, she continues to exemplify the pre-determined social classifications surrounding gender in our society by using competitive sports.\n\nIn Lorber’s section of this Chapter 3 headed ‘What Sports Illustrate,’ she argues that the pre-determined societal beliefs surrounding gender have turned competitive sports into a way for men to legitimize aggression and create their masculine identity. Conversely, Lorber believes that the female sex in competitive sports is made a mockery of and continually takes a “secondary status” to competitive male sports. Lorber uses the example of basketball to confirm her belief. She correlates the female secondary status to assumptions surrounding women’s physiology. As well Lorber believes this assumption of physiology influences rules in women's sports, rules in sporting competitions, and how women are treated in sporting competitions.\n\nHowever, Lorber connects these social barriers that continually separate the sexes in sports, with the economical barriers oppressing the female sex. She compares competitive sports to big businesses and therefore argues that they are no longer just a social construct but an economic, political, and ideological issue developed by those who define and profit from competitive sports.\n\nLorber continues to describe social boundaries set up by gender using technology; she brings up two examples—computers and cars. When computers first came into use, office jobs involving them were given to women, as it appeared to be a clerical duty. It was not until computers were revealed to be complex and intellectually demanding that they became the domain of men. “By the 1960s programing was split into more and less skilled specialties, and the entry of women into the computer field in the 1970s and 1980s was confined to the lower paid specialties…employers invoked women and men’s purportedly natural capabilities for the jobs for which they were hired”. This means women will do the more menial tasks, where men will shape the industry and control it. Lorber also describes how this has influenced young people; for example we see far more young men and boys playing computer games and getting involved in computer clubs. In this way we are furthering women’s supposed natural disadvantage with computers by allowing boys to get more education and comfort with computers than girls.\n\nThis pattern of male control over technology continues when it comes to cars. Lorber references the fact that in couples a man will almost always be the more frequent driver, regardless of aptitude. This may seem like an inconsequential example, but Lorber asks us to consider in different contexts what a vehicle can mean. She describes the importance of the mobility, literally and figuratively, given to women by driving. Feminists used driving “to campaign for women’s suffrage in parts of the United States not served by public transportation and they effectively used motorcades and speaking from cars as campaign tactics”. Lorber also describes the sense of liberation felt by many women when they first experienced driving, while participating in First World War efforts. This gendering of who a driver can be does limit women’s options in the world more than we consider when we simply see the male in a couple taking the wheel.\n\nLorber finalizes her arguments discussing the paradoxes of human nature. She confirms, “gendered people do not emerge from physiology or hormones, but from the exigencies of the social order”. Lorber points out that the diversity of humans could be categorized, regrouped and broken up into different ways of comparison than the traditional sex differentiation that disregards the real issues of who is truly like whom. She argues that the problem of basing knowledge on presumptions of gender differences reaffirms the categorization of the ‘male’ versus ‘female’. When relying on the conventional categorization of gender, one is able to find what they are looking for. Lorber states, “we see what we believe, whether it is that ‘female’ and ‘males’ are essentially different or that ‘women’ and ‘men’ are essentially the same.\n\nJudith Lorber received the American Sociological Association’s Jessie Bernard Career Award in 1996 for “scholarly work that has enlarged the horizons of sociology to encompass fully the role of women in society.” She was President of the Eastern Sociological Society in 2001–2002, Chair of the Sex and Gender Section of the American Sociological Association in 1993, and President of Sociologists for Women in Society in 1981–82.\n\nShe has held several international visiting professorships. In 1992–1993, she had a Fulbright Award for lecturing at Bar Ilan University and for research in Israel. She was Guest Professor at Åbo Akademi, Turku, Finland, in 1996. In 1997, she held the Marie Jahoda International Visiting Professorship of Feminist Studies at Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany. In the last few years, she has been a Visiting Professor at the University of Dortmund, Germany, the Carl von Ossietzky University, Oldenburg, Germany and served as a Fulbright Senior Specialist at Bar Ilan University.\n\nLorber was invited and has given conference presentations in almost every state in the US, and she has had two Eastern Sociological Society Lectureships (Maurice Falk in 1978 and 1981 and Robin Williams in 1996–1997) and the Sociologists for Women in Society Feminist Lectureship in 1992. She was invited to present her work at international sociology and women’s studies conferences in China, Africa, South Korea, Australia, Canada, Israel, Scandinavia, the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany, and Switzerland.\n\nLorber has published a number of books including:\n\nHer co-edited works include:\n\n"}

{"id": "23060403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23060403", "title": "Motor theory of speech perception", "text": "Motor theory of speech perception\n\nThe motor theory of speech perception is the hypothesis that people perceive spoken words by identifying the vocal tract gestures with which they are pronounced rather than by identifying the sound patterns that speech generates. It originally claimed that speech perception is done through a specialized module that is innate and human-specific. Though the idea of a module has been qualified in more recent versions of the theory, the idea remains that the role of the speech motor system is not only to produce speech articulations but also to detect them.\n\nThe hypothesis has gained more interest outside the field of speech perception than inside. This has increased particularly since the discovery of mirror neurons that link the production and perception of motor movements, including those made by the vocal tract.\n\nThe theory was initially proposed in the Haskins Laboratories in the 1950s by Alvin Liberman and Franklin S. Cooper, and developed further by Donald Shankweiler, Michael Studdert-Kennedy, Ignatius Mattingly, Carol Fowler and Douglas Whalen.\n\nThe hypothesis has its origins in research using pattern playback to create reading machines for the blind that would substitute sounds for orthographic letters. This led to a close examination of how spoken sounds correspond to the acoustic spectrogram of them as a sequence of auditory sounds. This found that successive consonants and vowels overlap in time with one another (a phenomenon known as coarticulation). This suggested that speech is not heard like an acoustic \"alphabet\" or \"cipher,\" but as a \"code\" of overlapping speech gestures.\n\nInitially, the theory was associationist: infants mimic the speech they hear and that this leads to behavioristic associations between articulation and its sensory consequences. Later, this overt mimicry would be short-circuited and become speech perception. This aspect of the theory was dropped, however, with the discovery that prelinguistic infants could already detect most of the phonetic contrasts used to separate different speech sounds.\n\nThe behavioristic approach was replaced by a cognitivist one in which there was a speech module. The module detected speech in terms of hidden distal objects rather than at the proximal or immediate level of their input. The evidence for this was the research finding that speech processing was special such as duplex perception.\n\nInitially, speech perception was assumed to link to speech objects that were both\nThis was later revised to include the phonetic gestures rather than motor commands, and then the gestures intended by the speaker at a prevocal, linguistic level, rather than actual movements.\n\nThe \"speech is special\" claim has been dropped, as it was found that speech perception could occur for nonspeech sounds (for example, slamming doors for duplex perception).\n\nThe discovery of mirror neurons has led to renewed interest in the motor theory of speech perception, and the theory still has its advocates, although there are also critics.\n\nIf speech is identified in terms of how it is physically made, then nonauditory information should be incorporated into speech percepts even if it is still subjectively heard as \"sounds\". This is, in fact, the case.\n\nUsing a speech synthesizer, speech sounds can be varied in place of articulation along a continuum from to to , or in voice onset time on a continuum from to (for example). When listeners are asked to discriminate between two different sounds, they perceive sounds as belonging to discrete categories, even though the sounds vary continuously. In other words, 10 sounds (with the sound on one extreme being and the sound on the other extreme being , and the ones in the middle varying on a scale) may all be acoustically different from one another, but the listener will hear all of them as either or . Likewise, the English consonant may vary in its acoustic details across different phonetic contexts (the /d/ in does not technically sound the same as the one in , for example), but all 's as perceived by a listener fall within one category (voiced alveolar plosive) and that is because \"linguistic representations are abstract, canonical, phonetic segments or the gestures that underlie these segments.\" This suggests that humans identify speech using categorical perception, and thus that a specialized module, such as that proposed by the motor theory of speech perception, may be on the right track.\n\nIf people can hear the gestures in speech, then the imitation of speech should be very fast, as in when words are repeated that are heard in headphones as in speech shadowing. People can repeat heard syllables more quickly than they would be able to produce them normally.\n\n\nEvidence exists that perception and production are generally coupled in the motor system. This is supported by the existence of mirror neurons that are activated both by seeing (or hearing) an action and when that action is carried out. Another source of evidence is that for common coding theory between the representations used for perception and action.\n\nThe motor theory of speech perception is not widely held in the field of speech perception, though it is more popular in other fields, such as theoretical linguistics. As three of its advocates have noted, \"it has few proponents within the field of speech perception, and many authors cite it primarily to offer critical commentary\". Several critiques of it exist.\n\nSpeech perception is affected by nonproduction sources of information, such as context. Individual words are hard to understand in isolation but easy when heard in sentence context. It therefore seems that speech perception uses multiple sources that are integrated together in an optimal way.\n\nThe motor theory of speech perception would predict that speech motor abilities in infants predict their speech perception abilities, but in actuality it is the other way around. It would also predict that defects in speech production would impair speech perception, but they do not. However, this only affects the first and already superseded behaviorist version of the theory, where infants were supposed to learn \"all\" production-perception patterns by imitation early in childhood. This is no longer the mainstream view of motor-speech theorists.\n\nSeveral sources of evidence for a specialized speech module have failed to be supported. \nAs a result, this part of the theory has been dropped by some researchers.\n\nThe evidence provided for the motor theory of speech perception is limited to tasks such as syllable discrimination that use speech units not full spoken words or spoken sentences. As a result, \"speech perception is sometimes interpreted as referring to the perception of speech at the sublexical level. However, the ultimate goal of these studies is presumably to understand the neural processes supporting the ability to process speech sounds under ecologically valid conditions, that is, situations in which successful speech sound processing ultimately leads to contact with the mental lexicon and auditory comprehension.\" This however creates the problem of \" a tenuous connection to their implicit target of investigation, speech recognition\".\n\nThe motor theory of speech perception faces the problem that the research linking speech perception to speech production is also consistent with the brain processing speech to imitate spoken words. The brain must have a means to do this if language is to exist, since a child's vocabulary expansion requires a means to learn novel spoken words, as does an adult's picking up of new names. Imitation has to be initiated for all vocalizations since a word's novelty cannot be known until after it is heard, and so after when the information needed to identify its articulation gestures and motor goals has gone. As result vocal imitation needs to be initiated by default into short term memory for every heard spoken vocalizations. If speech perception uses multiple sources of information, this default imitation processing would provide as a secondary use an extra source for word perception. Since imitation will be most needed for vocalizations that are not proper words, this could explain why sublexical tasks that do not use proper words so strongly link to processing of motor gestures.\n\nIt has been suggested that birds also hear each other's bird song in terms of vocal gestures.\n\n\n"}

Many libertarians justify their political views using aspects of Objectivism. However, the views of Rand and her philosophy among prominent libertarians are mixed and many Objectivists are hostile to libertarians in general.\n\nSome libertarians, including Murray Rothbard and Walter Block, hold the view that the non-aggression principle is an irreducible concept: it is not the logical result of any given ethical philosophy but, rather, is self-evident as any other axiom is. Rand, too, argued that liberty was a precondition of virtuous conduct, but argued that her non-aggression principle itself derived from a complex set of previous knowledge and values. For this reason, Objectivists refer to the non-aggression principle as such, while libertarians who agree with Rothbard's argument call it \"the non-aggression axiom.\"\n\nRothbard and other anarcho-capitalists hold that government requires non-voluntary taxation to function and that in all known historical cases, the state was established by force rather than social contract. They thus consider the establishment and maintenance of the night-watchman state supported by Objectivists to be in violation of the non-aggression principle. On the other hand, Rand believed that government can in principle be funded through voluntary means. Voluntary financing notwithstanding, libertarians consider that a government would by definition still violate individual rights (commit aggression) by enforcing a monopoly over a given territory. Objectivists do not specify what would be the legitimate expanse of the state's territory, nor what would be the proper way of reaching political decisions without violating the rights of disagreeing minorities.\n\nJennifer Burns in her biography \"\", notes how Rand's position that \"Native Americans were savages\", and that as a result \"European colonists had a right to seize their land because native tribes did not recognize individual rights\", was one of the views that \"particularly outraged libertarians.\" Burns also notes how Rand's position that \"Palestinians had no rights and that it was moral to support Israel, the sole outpost of civilization in a region ruled by barbarism\", was also a controversial position amongst libertarians, who at the time were a large portion of Rand's fan base.\n\nLibertarians and Objectivists often disagree about matters of foreign policy. Rand's rejection of what she deemed to be \"primitivism\" extended to the Middle East peace process in the 1970s. Following the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, Rand denounced Arabs as \"primitive\" and \"one of the least developed cultures\" who \"are typically nomads.\" Consequently, Rand contended Arab resentment for Israel was a result of the Jewish state being \"the sole beachhead of modern science and civilization on their (Arabs) continent\", while decreeing that \"when you have civilized men fighting savages, you support the civilized men, no matter who they are.\"\n\nMost scholars of the libertarian Cato Institute have opposed military intervention against Iran, while the Objectivist Ayn Rand Institute has supported forceful intervention in Iran.\n\nThe United States Libertarian Party's first candidate for President of the United States, John Hospers, credited Rand as a major force in shaping his own political beliefs. David Boaz, executive vice president of the Cato Institute, an American libertarian think tank, described Rand's work as \"squarely within the libertarian tradition\" and that some libertarians are put off by \"the starkness of her presentation and by her cult following.\" Milton Friedman described Rand as \"an utterly intolerant and dogmatic person who did a great deal of good.\" One Rand biographer quoted Murray Rothbard as saying that he was \"in agreement basically with all [Rand's] philosophy,\" and saying that it was Rand who had \"convinced him of the theory of natural rights...\" Rothbard would later become a particularly harsh critic of Rand, writing in \"The Sociology of the Ayn Rand Cult\" that:\n\nSome Objectivists have argued that Objectivism is not limited to Rand's own positions on philosophical issues and are willing to work with and identify with the libertarian movement. This stance is most clearly identified with David Kelley (who separated from the Ayn Rand Institute because of disagreements over the relationship between Objectivists and libertarians), Chris Sciabarra, Barbara Branden (Nathaniel Branden's former wife), and others. Kelley's Atlas Society has focused on building a closer relationship between \"open Objectivists\" and the libertarian movement.\n\nRand condemned libertarianism as being a greater threat to freedom and capitalism than both modern liberalism and conservatism. Rand regarded Objectivism as an integrated philosophical system. Libertarianism, in contrast, is a political philosophy which confines its attention to matters of public policy. For example, Objectivism argues positions in metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics, whereas libertarianism does not address such questions. Rand believed that political advocacy could not succeed without addressing what she saw as its methodological prerequisites. Rand rejected any affiliation with the libertarian movement and many other Objectivists have done so as well.\n\nRand said of libertarians that:\nIn a 1981 interview, Rand described libertarians as \"a monstrous, disgusting bunch of people\" who \"plagiarize my ideas when that fits their purpose.\"\n\nResponding to a question about the Libertarian Party in 1976, Rand said:\nIn 2011, Yaron Brook, then-Executive Director of the Ayn Rand Institute, spoke at the Foundation for Economic Education. He was a keynote speaker at FreedomFest 2012 and appeared on ReasonTV on July 26, 2012.\n\nAyn Rand Institute board member John Allison spoke at the Cato Club 200 Retreat in September 2012, contributed \"The Real Causes of the Financial Crisis\" to \"Cato's Letter\", and spoke at Cato's Monetary Conference in November 2011.\n\nOn June 25, 2012, the Cato Institute announced that John Allison would become its next president. In Cato's public announcement, Allison was described as a \"revered libertarian.\" In communication to Cato employees, he wrote, \"I believe almost all the name calling between libertarians and objectivists is irrational. I have come to appreciate that all objectivists are libertarians, but not all libertarians are objectivists.\"\n\nOn October 15, 2012, Brook explained the changes to \"The American Conservative\":\n\n\n"}

Main source was Old Slavic customary law: Zakon Russkiy (Law of Rus') (it was partly written in Rus'–Byzantine Treaties). Another sources were Old Scandinavian customary law (see: Varangians) and Byzantine law (since the 10th century).\n\nThe main written sources were Russkaya Pravda (\"Russian Justice\") (since the 11th century) and Statutes of Lithuania (since the 16th century).\n\nAccording to Old Russian chronicles, in 862, Slavs and Finns invited Varangians under the leadership of prince Rurik to rule in their land:\n\nEarly Russian state settled on the oral treaty, or \"ryad\" (Old Russian: рядъ) between the prince (knyaz) with his armed force (druzhina) on the one hand, and tribal \"nobility\" and formally all people on the other hand. The prince and his druzhina defended people, decide lawsuits, provided trade and built towns. And people paid tribute and took part in irregular military. During the ensuing centuries the \"ryad\" was playing an important role in Old Russian princedoms: the prince and his administration (druzhina) found their relationship with people (\"all land\", \"all townsmen\" in Old Russian chronicles) on the treaty. A breach of the treaty could result in exile of the prince (Izyaslav Yaroslavich and Vsevolod Yaroslavich) or even in murder of the prince (Igor Rurikovich and Igor Olgovich).\n\nOne of the result of Rus'–Byzantine Wars was conclusion of Treaties with Byzantine in the 10th century, where, apart from Byzantine legal rules, also Zakon Russkiy (Law of Rus') - rules of Old Russian oral customary law reflected.\n\nYaroslav's Pravda of the beginning of the 11th century was the first written law in Rus'. This short code regulated the relationship between the princely druzhina (\"rusins\") and the people (\"slovenins\") concerning criminal law. After Yaroslav's death, his sons Izyaslav, Vsevolod, Svyatoslav and their druzhina got together and promulgated a code concerning the violation of property rights in princely lands (Pravda of Yaroslav's sons) in the middle of the 11th century. Yaroslav's Pravda and Pravda of Yaroslav's sons became a basis for the Short edition of Russkaya Pravda.\n\nIn the period of Vladimir Monomakh's reign at the beginning of the 12th century, the Vast edition of Russkaya Pravda was given, which contained rules of criminal, procedural and civil law, including trade, family law and rules of the bond of obligation.\n\nLater written secular law also included statutory charters, trade treaties, statutes of Grand Duchy of Lithuania, big codes of Moscow Rus' - Sudebniks (see below), and other texts.\n\nTranslations of Byzantine legal codes, including Nomocanon, were widely spread in Old Rus' (see: Kormchaia, Merilo Pravednoye), but it wasn't widely applied in secular or church legal practice, restricted mainly in canon law. The Church in Old Rus' did not have wide influence and depended on the power of the state. Thus, church law mainly dealt with family law and sanctions against moral violation.\n\nSee also: church statutes of prince Vladimir and prince Yaroslav.\n\n\nForeign sources\n\n\nNative sources\n\nIt was in part a record of oral law and revision of foreign sources:\n\n\n\n\n"}

It often graces punk rock album covers, flyers for punk concerts, punk zines and punk websites. It is also sometimes showcased in art galleries and exhibition spaces.\n\nThe main aesthetic of punk visual art seems to be to either shock, create a sense of empathy or revulsion, make a grand point with an acidic or sarcastic wit. One characteristic associated with punk art is the usage of letters cut out from newspapers and magazines, a device previously associated with kidnap and ransom notes. A prominent example of that style is the cover of the Sex Pistols' \"Never Mind the Bollocks\" album designed by Jamie Reid. Images and figures are also sometimes cut and pasted from magazines and newspapers to create a collage.\n\nLos Angeles artist Mark Vallen has said:\n\nPunk had a unique and complex aesthetic. It was steeped in shock value and revered what was considered ugly. The whole look of punk was designed to disturb and disrupt the happy complacency of the wider society. Outside of punk's torn and safety pinned anti-fashion statements, this impulse to outrage was never more apparent than on punk album covers.\n\nIn New York City in the mid-1970s, there was much overlap between the punk music and art scenes. In 1978, many of the visual artists who were regulars at CBGB and other punk-related music venues participated in a large punk art exhibition in Washington, DC. Among those featured were John Holmstrom and Legs McNeil of the fanzine \"Punk\",; Alan Vega (a.k.a. Alan Suicide), whose electronic junk sculpture predated his role in the band Suicide; photographers Marcia Resnick and Jimmy De Sana; tattoo artist Ruth Marten; filmmaker Amos Poe; and artists Tom Otterness and Beth and Scott B, who were associated with \"X Magazine\".\n\nAlso in 1978 in New York City, a related, one-night punk art show featuring films, performances and slide shows included works by Robert Mapplethorpe and Diego Cortez. Other early punk art exhibits included the \"Times Square Show\" (1980) and \"New York New Wave\" at PS 1 (1981). Punk art found an ongoing home on the New York's lower east side with the establishment of ABC No Rio Gallery in 1980. The punk aesthetic was a dominant strand from 1982 to 1986 in the art galleries of the city's East Village.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "190054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190054", "title": "Spelling", "text": "Spelling\n\nSpelling is the combination of alphabetic letters to form a written word. It is a linguistic process of correct writing with the necessary letters and diacritics present in a comprehensible, usually standardized order. While a part of a language's orthography, not all languages have purely phonemic alphabets. Standardized spelling is a prescriptive element.\n\nSpellings originated as transcriptions of the sounds of spoken language according to the alphabetic principle. They remain largely reflective of the sounds, although fully phonemic spelling is an ideal that most languages' orthographies only approximate, some more closely than others. This is true for various reasons, including that pronunciation changes over time in all languages, yet spellings as visual norms may resist change. In addition, words from other languages may be adopted without being adapted to the spelling system, and different meanings of a word or homophones may be deliberately spelled in different ways to differentiate them visually.\n\nUniformity in the spelling of words is one of the features of a standard language in modern times, and official languages usually have standard spellings. However, this is a relatively recent development linked to the compiling of dictionaries, the founding of national academies and other institutions of language maintenance, including widespread education and literacy, and often doesn't apply to minority and regional languages.\n\nIn countries where there is an official language academy; such as France, the Netherlands, and Germany, reforms are regularly made so that spelling better matches the changing pronunciation.\n\nExamples include:\n\nEnglish-language spelling reform proposals have been regularly made since the 16th century, but have made little impact apart from a few spellings preferred by Noah Webster having contributed to American and British English spelling differences.\n\nIn October 2018 the Welcome Collection used the spelling of women as womxn in a tweet, explaining \"we feel that it is important to create a space/venue that includes diverse perspectives\".\n\nLearning proper spelling by rote is a traditional element of elementary education and divergence from standard spelling is often perceived as an indicator of low intelligence, illiteracy, or lower class standing.\n\nSpelling tests are commonly used to assess a student's mastery over the words in the spelling lessons the student has received so far. They can also be an effective practice method. Spelling bees are competitions to determine the best speller of a group. Prominent spelling bees are even televised, such as the National Spelling Bee in the United States.\n\nDivergent spelling is a popular advertising technique, used to attract attention or to render a trademark \"suggestive\" rather than \"merely descriptive.\" The pastry chains Dunkin' Donuts (Dunkin' Donuts changes its name to Dunkin' from January 2019) and Krispy Kreme, for example, employ non-standard spellings.\n\nWhile some words admit multiple spellings, some are not considered standard, and thus are misspellings. A misspelled word can be a series of letters that represents no correctly spelled word of the same language at all (such as \"liek\" for \"like\") or a correct spelling of another word (such as writing \"here\" when one means \"hear\", or \"no\" when one means \"know\"). Misspellings of the latter type can easily make their way into printed material because they are not caught by simple computerized spell checkers.\n\nMisspellings may be due to either typing errors (e.g. the transposition error \"teh\" for \"the\"), or lack of knowledge of the correct spelling. Whether or not a word is misspelled may depend on context, as is the case with American / British English distinctions. Misspelling can also be a matter of opinion when variant spellings are accepted by some and not by others. For example, \"miniscule\" (for \"minuscule\") is a misspelling to many, and yet it is listed as an acceptable variant in some dictionaries.\n\nA well-known Internet scam involves the registration of domain names that are deliberate misspellings of well-known corporate names in order to mislead or defraud. The practice is commonly known as \"typosquatting\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

James Dunn, in a 1980 literature review of academic work on the incarnation, noted the \"...well-publicized symposium entitled \"The Myth of God Incarnate\", including contributions on the NT from M. Goulder and F. Young, which provoked several responses.\" Two years later, in another literature review, R. T. France commented that \"theology dropped out of the headlines again, until in 1977 the title, if not the contents, of \"The Myth of God Incarnate\" revived public interest\". In the 21st century, \"The Daily Telegraph\" 2005 obituary for contributor Maurice Wiles (father of Andrew Wiles) described the book as \"a highly controversial volume of essays.\"\nThe controversy prompted a sequel, \"Incarnation and Myth: the Debate Continued\" (1979), edited by Michael Goulder, another contributor to the original volume.\n\nIn the preface to the book, the contributors start by describing their \"clear\" perception that Christianity has always been a changing and diverse \"movement\" quoting T. S. Eliot—\"Christianity is always adapting itself into something which can be believed.\" They also explain that they are \"convinced\" that growing knowledge of Christian origins leads to accepting that Jesus was ... 'a man approved by God' for a special role within the divine purpose,\" but that later Christian conceptions of him \"as God incarnate, the Second Person of the Holy Trinity\" were a \"mythological or poetic way of expressing his significance for us.\" The contributors also mention that: \"we have met together for discussion five times during the last three years, and we now offer the results in the hope that they will stimulate a wider discussion both inside and outside the churches.\"\n\nThe contributors to Hick's collection of essays divided their work into two sections: the first examining \"Christian sources\"; and the second examining \"the development of doctrine.\" In the preface, however, they note that this division is not absolute, since sources and contemporary issues are related, and discussion of either references the other.\n\nMaurice Wiles' 10-page introductory chapter to the volume questions whether \"the incarnation of God in the particular individual Jesus of Nazareth\" is actually essential to Christianity, or whether there can be \"a Christianity without (in this sense) incarnation?\" He structures his essay in three numbered parts, each of which is a subquestion. Wiles' subquestions explore whether his main question \"is (1) a proper, (2) a necessary and (3) a constructive question to ask.\"\n\nRegarding his first subquestion, Wiles addresses the \"many ears\" he expects might find \"Christianity\" and \"incarnation\" \"so nearly synonymous that the suggestion of a possible 'Christianity without incarnation' will sound to them equally paradoxical and unintelligible.\" He explains that \"incarnation\", in the sense in which he is using the term, is just one \"interpretation of the significance of Jesus.\" Wiles provides three analogies from other Christian thinking to illustrate his meaning: the eucharist, the relationship between the authority and inerrancy of the Bible, and the relationship between incarnation and the virgin birth of Jesus. In each case, abstract doctrines have been so associated with concrete applications, that denials of the concrete applications have historically been seen as denials of the abstract doctrines, hence heresies. However, with the eucharist in particular, Reformation theologians affirmed a meaningful understanding of the eucharist, despite denying the concrete application of transubstantiation—that bread and wine physically become the body and blood of Jesus in the Roman Catholic mass. Wiles concludes that his main question (regarding Christianity without incarnation) is not a contradiction but a proper question, just like the Reformation question regarding a eucharist without transubstantiation.\n\nWiles offers, under three subheadings, three lines of argument in support of his position that \"separating 'Christianity' and 'incarnation' is not merely ... admissible ... but ... inescapable.\" According to Wiles, the question of separation is a necessary question arising from: (a) the origins, (b) the history, and (c) contemporary affirmation of incarnational doctrine. Regarding (a) origins, Wiles contends that, \"Incarnation, in its proper sense, is not something directly presented in scripture. It is a construction ...\" He acknowledges that New Testament (NT) writers \"talk of [Jesus] as God's pre-existent Son come down to earth.\" However, Wiles' views this as a manner of speech (\"one of a number of ways in which Christians thought and spoke of Jesus.\"). He proposes that it is no longer reasonable, to \"the main body even of convinced believers\", to speak in such terms as the NT writers, which presume what moderns do not, namely \"supernatural divine intervention ... as a natural category of thought and faith.\"\n\nWiles offers an additional argument for the necessity of questioning the actuality of the incarnation, by expressing dissatisfaction with the intelligibility of (b) historical formulations of incarnational doctrine: \"Are we sure that the concept of an incarnate being, one who is both fully God and fully man, is after all an intelligible concept?\" Although he concedes that \"negative generalizations are notoriously dangerous claims to make,\" he ventures that \"the church has never succeeded in offering a consistent or convincing picture\" of how Jesus could actually be both God and man. In particular he suggests a tendency to err in favour of Jesus as divine, citing the seventh century Monothelite controversy and E. L. Mascall as a distinguished exemplar of the traditional view writing at the time Wiles' essay was published. Wiles concludes his grounds for the necessity of his main question by further appeal to (c) the writing of his own contemporaries. He notes that \"incarnation\", as understood in the work of John Baker, for example, is so far removed from the original NT usage, that \"it is not genuinely the same idea that is being expressed.\" Wiles quotes Baker: \"Jesus did not see himself ... as a divine pre-existent being from heaven.\"\n\nTo conclude his analysis of the value of questioning the actuality of the incarnation, Wiles anticipates that \"some people\" might \"feel\" that were such questioning to \"lead to the abandonment of traditional incarnational doctrine, that could only be regarded as an entirely negative and destructive outcome.\" To help allay such fears, Wiles offers three ideas, historically highly valued in Christian traditions and associated with the incarnation but, he argues, are \"not necessarily bound to the incarnation and would not therefore be eliminated from a 'Christianity without incarnation'. The first idea, listed as (a), is \"the conviction that the physical world can be the carrier of spiritual value.\" Wiles notes that this anti-dualist position within Christianity, denying strict separation between the spiritual and the physical, is shared with Judaism, which clearly has no doctrine of Jesus as God incarnate. Wiles clarifies that he is proposing a Christianity that retains a genuine broad sense of incarnation of spirituality, especially in its doctrine of creation, just without applying this too strictly to the person of Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nThe second idea, listed as (b), is \"the significance of Jesus as a model for human life.\" Wiles observes that there has been considerable diversity in what people have considered to be lives patterned on Jesus as the standard; and that even the NT does not provide a comprehensive picture of just precisely how Jesus lived his entire life. He quotes R. H. Lightfoot, who famously declared, \"the form of the earthly no less than of the heavenly Christ is for the most part hidden from us.\" Even given these limitations, Wiles reflects that \"on any showing to which the name of Christian could conceivably be given [Jesus'] life would remain of substantial importance to us.\" So, Wiles suggests, Jesus' significance as a role-model \"is not directly affected by the way in which his relationship to God is understood.\"\n\nBefore concluding his essay, Wiles considers what he believes to be the most important traditional incarnation-related idea, transformed but retained under his new understanding. Listed as (c), it is the view that in Jesus, \"God has acted decisively for the salvation of the world.\" He anticipates the objection that his transformation would \"imply that the worship of Christ, traditional throughout the whole of Christian history, was idolatrous in character.\" He acknowledges that \"It is at this point that the greatest difficulties are likely to be felt. Can they be met?\" Although he provides no conclusive answer, Wiles stresses that his new understanding of incarnation could still provide for Jesus to \"remain a personal focus of the transforming power of God in the world.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Nearby was the city of Tiliuhcan.\n\nFounded by Tlacomatzin, Tlacopan was a Tepanec kingdom subordinate to nearby Azcapotzalco.\n\nTlacopan sided with Tenochtitlan and Texcoco in their conquest of Azcapotzalco, becoming a member of the Triple Alliance which formed the nucleus of the Aztec Empire. The ruler of Tlacopan, Totoquihuaztli, then took the title \"Tepaneca tecuhtli\", \"Lord of the Tepanecs\" (probably taken from the rulers of Azcapotzalco). Tlacopan was to remain a junior partner in the alliance, receiving only a fifth of the tribute gained from joint campaigns with its more powerful allies.\n\nThe Triple Alliance ended with the Spanish conquest of Mexico by Hernán Cortés and native allies in 1521. Over the centuries, Mexico City expanded to include the former site of Tlacopan, today's neighborhood of Tacuba in the Mexico City borough of Miguel Hidalgo.\n"}
{"id": "149920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=149920", "title": "Toy", "text": "Toy\n\nA toy is an item that is used in play, especially one designed for such use. Playing with toys can be an enjoyable means of training young children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used. For instance, a small child may fold an ordinary piece of paper into an airplane shape and \"fly it\". \nNewer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment. Some toys are produced primarily as collectors' items and are intended for display only.\n\nThe origin of toys is prehistoric; dolls representing infants, animals, and soldiers, as well as representations of tools used by adults are readily found at archaeological sites. The origin of the word \"toy\" is unknown, but it is believed that it was first used in the 14th century. Toys are mainly made for children. The oldest known doll toy is thought to be 4,000 years old.\n\nPlaying with toys is considered to be important when it comes to growing up and learning about the world around us. Younger children use toys to discover their identity, help their bodies grow strong, learn cause and effect, explore relationships, and practice skills they will need as adults. Adults on occasion use toys to form and strengthen social bonds, teach, help in therapy, and to remember and reinforce lessons from their youth.\n\nMost children have been said to play with whatever they can find, such as sticks and rocks. \nToys and games have been unearthed from the sites of ancient civilizations. They have been written about in some of the oldest literature. Toys excavated from the Indus valley civilization (3010–1500 BCE) include small carts, whistles shaped like birds, and toy monkeys which could slide down a string.\n\nThe earliest toys are made from materials found in nature, such as rocks, sticks, and clay. Thousands of years ago, Egyptian children played with dolls that had wigs and movable limbs which were made from stone, pottery, and wood. In Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, children played with dolls made of wax or terracotta, sticks, bows and arrows, and yo-yos. When Greek children, especially girls, came of age it was customary for them to sacrifice the toys of their childhood to the gods. On the eve of their wedding, young girls around fourteen would offer their dolls in a temple as a rite of passage into adulthood.\n\nThe oldest known mechanical puzzle also comes from Greece and appeared in the 3rd century BC. The game consisted of a square divided into 14 parts, and the aim was to create different shapes from these pieces. In Iran \"puzzle-locks\" were made as early as the 17th century (AD).\n\nToys became more widespread with the changing attitudes towards children engendered by the Enlightenment. Children began to be seen as people in and of themselves, as opposed to extensions of their household and that they had a right to flourish and enjoy their childhood. The variety and number of toys that were manufactured during the 18th century steadily rose; John Spilsbury invented the first jigsaw puzzle in 1767 to help children learn geography. He created puzzles on eight themes – the World, Europe, Asia, Africa, America, England and Wales, Ireland and Scotland. The rocking horse (on bow rockers) was developed at the same time in England, especially with the wealthy as it was thought to develop children's balance for riding real horses.\nBlowing bubbles from leftover washing up soap became a popular pastime, as shown in the painting \"The Soap Bubble\" (1739) by Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin. Other popular toys included hoops, toy wagons, kites, spinning wheels and puppets. The first board games were produced by John Jefferys in the 1750s, including \"A Journey Through Europe\". The game was very similar to modern board games; players moved along a track with the throw of a dice (a teetotum was actually used) and landing on different spaces would either help or hinder the player.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the emphasis was put on toys that had an educational purpose to them, such as puzzles, books, cards and board games. Religiously themed toys were also popular, including a model Noah's Ark with miniature animals and objects from other Bible scenes. With growing prosperity among the middle class, children had more leisure time on their hands, which led to the application of industrial methods to the manufacture of toys.\n\nMore complex mechanical and optics-based toys were also invented. Carpenter and Westley began to mass-produce the kaleidoscope, invented by Sir David Brewster in 1817, and had sold over 200,000 items within three months in London and Paris. The company was also able to mass-produce magic lanterns for use in phantasmagoria and galanty shows, by developing a method of mass production using a copper plate printing process. Popular imagery on the lanterns included royalty, flora and fauna, and geographical/man-made structures from around the world. The modern zoetrope was invented in 1833 by British mathematician William George Horner and was popularized in the 1860s. Wood and porcelain dolls in miniature doll houses were popular with middle class girls, while boys played with marbles and toy trains.\n\nThe golden age of toy development was at the turn of the 20th century. Real wages were rising steadily in the Western world, allowing even working-class families to afford toys for their children, and industrial techniques of precision engineering and mass production was able to provide the supply to meet this rising demand. Intellectual emphasis was also increasingly being placed on the importance of a wholesome and happy childhood for the future development of children. William Harbutt, an English painter, invented plasticine in 1897, and in 1900 commercial production of the material as a children's toy began. Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture and was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on engineering principles in the twentieth century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways and Dinky Toys.\n\nMeccano was a model construction system that consisted of re-usable metal strips, plates, angle girders, wheels, axles and gears, with nuts and bolts to connect the pieces and enabled the building of working models and mechanical devices. Dinky Toys pioneered the manufacture of die-cast toys with the production of toy cars, trains and ships and model train sets became popular in the 1920s. The Britain's company revolutionized the production of toy soldiers with the invention of the process of hollow casting in lead in 1893 – the company's products remained the industry standard for many years.\n\nPuzzles became greatly fashionable as well. In 1893, the English lawyer , writing under the pseudonym of Professor Hoffman, wrote a book called \"Puzzles Old and New\". It contained, amongst other things, more than 40 descriptions of puzzles with secret opening mechanisms. This book grew into a reference work for puzzle games and was very popular at the time. The Tangram puzzle, originally from China, spread to Europe and America in the 19th century.\n\nDuring the Second World War, some new types of toys were created through accidental innovation. After trying to create a replacement for synthetic rubber, the American Earl L. Warrick inadvertently invented \"nutty putty\" during World War II. Later, Peter Hodgson recognized the potential as a childhood plaything and packaged it as Silly Putty. Similarly, Play-Doh was originally created as a wallpaper cleaner. In 1943 Richard James was experimenting with springs as part of his military research when he saw one come loose and fall to the floor. He was intrigued by the way it flopped around on the floor. He spent two years fine-tuning the design to find the best gauge of steel and coil; the result was the Slinky, which went on to sell in stores throughout the United States.\n\nAfter the Second World War as society became ever more affluent and new technology and materials (plastics) for toy manufacture became available, toys became cheap and ubiquitous in households across the Western World. Among the more well known products of the 1950s there was the Danish company Lego's line of colourful interlocking plastic brick construction sets, Rubik's Cube, Mr. Potato Head, the Barbie doll and Action Man. Today there are computerized dolls that can recognize and identify objects, the voice of their owner, and choose among hundreds of pre-programmed phrases with which to respond. The materials that toys are made from have changed, what toys can do has changed, but the fact that children play with toys has not.\n\nThe act of children's play with toys embodies the values set forth by the adults of their specific community, but through the lens of the child's perspective. Within cultural societies, toys are a medium to enhance a child's cognitive, social, and linguistic learning.\n\nIn some cultures, societies utilize toys as a way to enhance a child's skillset within the traditional boundaries of their future roles in the community. In Saharan and North African cultures, play is facilitated by children through the use of toys to enact scenes recognizable in their community such as hunting and herding. The value is placed in a realistic version of development in preparing a child for the future they are likely to grow up into. This allows the child to imagine and create a personal interpretation of how they view the adult world.\n\nHowever, in other cultures, toys are used to expand the development of a child's cognition in an idealistic fashion. In these communities, adults place the value of play with toys to be on the aspirations they set forth for their child. In the Western culture, the Barbie and Action-Man represent lifelike figures but in an imaginative state out of reach from the society of these children and adults. These toys give way to a unique world in which children's play is isolated and independent of the social constraints placed on society leaving the children free to delve into the imaginary and idealized version of what their development in life could be.\n\nIn addition, children from differing communities may treat their toys in different ways based on their cultural practices. Children in more affluent communities may tend to be possessive of their toys, while children from poorer communities may be more willing to share and interact more with other children. The importance the child places on possession is dictated by the values in place within the community that the children observe on a daily basis.\n\nToys, like play itself, serve multiple purposes in both humans and animals. They provide entertainment while fulfilling an educational role. Toys enhance cognitive behavior and stimulate creativity. They aid in the development of physical and mental skills which are necessary in later life.\n\nOne of the simplest toys, a set of simple wooden blocks is also one of the best toys for developing minds. Andrew Witkin, director of marketing for Mega Brands told Investor's Business Daily that, \"They help develop hand-eye coordination, math and science skills and also let kids be creative.\" Other toys like marbles, jackstones, and balls serve similar functions in child development, allowing children to use their minds and bodies to learn about spatial relationships, cause and effect, and a wide range of other skills.\nOne example of the dramatic ways that toys can influence child development involves clay sculpting toys such as Play-Doh and Silly Putty and their home-made counterparts. Mary Ucci, Educational Director of the Child Study Center of Wellesley College, has demonstrated how such toys positively impact the physical development, cognitive development, emotional development, and social development of children.\n\nToys for infants often make use of distinctive sounds, bright colors, and unique textures. Through play with toys infants begin to recognize shapes and colors. Repetition reinforces memory. Play-Doh, Silly Putty and other hands-on materials allow the child to make toys of their own.\n\nEducational toys for school age children of often contain a puzzle, problem-solving technique, or mathematical proposition. Often toys designed for older audiences, such as teenagers or adults, demonstrate advanced concepts. Newton's cradle, a desk toy designed by Simon Prebble, demonstrates the conservation of momentum and energy.\n\nNot all toys are appropriate for all ages of children. Even some toys which are marketed for a specific age range can even harm the development of children in that range.\n\n\"Age compression\" is a toy industry term that describes the modern trend of children moving through play stages faster than they did in the past. Children have a desire to progress to more complex toys at a faster pace, girls in particular. Barbie dolls, for example, were once marketed to girls around 8 years old but have been found to be more popular in recent years with girls around 3 years old. The packaging for the dolls labels them appropriate for ages 3 and up. Boys, in contrast, apparently enjoy toys and games over a longer timespan, gravitating towards toys that meet their interest in assembling and disassembling mechanical toys, and toys that \"move fast and things that fight\". An industry executive points out that girls have entered the \"tween\" phase by the time they are 8 years old and want non-traditional toys, whereas boys have been maintaining an interest in traditional toys until they are 12 years old, meaning the traditional toy industry holds onto their boy customers for 50% longer than their girl customers.\n\nGirls gravitate towards \"music, clothes, make-up, television talent shows and celebrities\". As young children are more exposed to and drawn to music intended for older children and teens, companies are having to rethink how they develop and market their products. Girls also demonstrate a longer loyalty to characters in toys and games marketed towards them. A variety of global toy companies have marketed themselves to this aspect of girls' development, for example, the Hello Kitty brand, and the Disney Princess franchise. Boys have shown an interest in computer games at an ever-younger age in recent years.\n\nCertain toys, such as Barbie dolls and toy soldiers, are often perceived as being more acceptable for one gender than the other. The turning point for the addition of gender to toys came about in the 1960s and 1970s. Before 1975, only about two percent of toys were labeled by gender, whereas today on the Disney store's website, considered a dominating global force for toys by researcher Claire Miller, all toys are labeled by gender. The journal \"Sex Roles\" began publishing research on this topic in 1975, focusing on the effects of gender in youth. Too, many psychological textbooks began to address this new issue. Along with these publications, researchers also started to challenge the ideas of male and female as being opposites, even going as far as to claim toys which have characteristics of both gender are preferable.\n\nA milestone for research on gender is the use of meta-analysis, which provides a way to assess patterns in a systematic way, which is especially relevant for a topic such as gender, which can be difficult to quantify. Nature and nurture have historically been analyzed when looking at gender in play, as well as reinforcement by peers and parents of typical gender roles and consequently, gender play. Toy companies have often promoted the segregation by gender in toys because it enables them to customize the same toy for each gender, which ultimately doubles their revenue. For example, Legos added more colors to certain sets of toys in the 1990s, including colors commonly attributed to girls such as lavender.\n\nIt has been noted by researchers that, \"Children as young as 18 months display sex-stereotyped toy choices\". When eye movement is tracked in young infants, infant girls show a visual preference for a doll over a toy truck (d > 1.0). Boys showed no preference for the truck over the doll. However, they did fixate on the truck more than the girls (d = .78). This small study suggests that even before any self-awareness of gender identity has emerged, children already prefer sex-typical toys. These differences in toy choice are well established within the child by the age of three.\n\nAnother study done by Jeffrey Trawick-Smith took 60 different children ages three to four and observed them playing with nine different toys deemed best for development. They were allowed to play with the toys in a typical environment, a preschool classroom, which allowed for the results to be more authentic compared to research done in a lab. The researchers then quantified play quality of the children with each toy based on factors such as learning, problem solving, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and peer interaction. The results revealed that boys generally received higher scores for overall play quality than girls, and the toys with the best play quality were those identified as the most gender neutral, such as building blocks and bricks along with pieces modeling people. Trawick-Smith then concluded that the study encourages a focus on toys which are beneficial to both genders in order to create a better balance.\n\nWhile some parents promote gender neutral play, many parents encourage their sons and daughters to participate in sex-typed activities, including doll playing and engaging in housekeeping activities for girls and playing with trucks and engaging in sports activities for boys.\nResearcher Susan Witt said that parents are the primary influencer on the gender roles of their children. Parents, siblings, peers, and even teachers have been shown to react more positively to children engaging in sex-typical behavior and playing with sex-typical toys. This is often done through encouragement or discouragement, as well as suggestions and imitation. Additionally, sons are more likely to be reinforced for sex-typical play and discouraged from atypical play. However, it is generally not as looked down upon for females to play with toys designed \"for boys\", an activity which has also become more common in recent years. Fathers are also more likely to reinforce typical play and discourage atypical play than mothers are. A study done by researcher Susan Witt suggests that stereotypes are oftentimes only strengthened by the environment, which perpetuates them to linger in older life.\n\nThis stereotypical attribution of sex-typical toys for girls and boys is gradually changing, with toys companies creating more gender neutral toys, as the benefits associated with allowing children to play with toys that appeal to them far outweighs controlling their individual preferences. For example, many stores are beginning to change their gender labels on children's play items. Target removed all identification related to gender from their toy aisles and Disney did the same for their costumes. The Disney store is an especially prevalent example of gender in play because they are a global identity in the toy world. A study done regarding their website found that though they have removed gender labels from their costumes, the toys online reflect more stereotypical gender identities. For example, males were associated with physicality and females were associated with beauty, housing, and caring. Too, though they promote their toys as being for both genders, there is no section for boys and girls combined on their website. Those which are generally deemed for both genders more closely resemble what many would label \"boy toys,\" as they relate closer to the stereotype of masculinity within play.\n\nTraditions within various cultures promote the passing down of certain toys to their children based on the child's gender. In South American Indian communities, boys receive a toy bow and arrow from their father while young girls receive a toy basket from their mother. In North African and Saharan cultural communities, gender plays a role in the creation of self-made dolls. While female dolls are used to represent brides, mothers, and wives, male dolls are used to represent horsemen and warriors. This contrast stems from the various roles of men and women within the Saharan and North African communities. There are differences in the toys that are intended for girls and boys within various cultures, which is reflective of the differing roles of men and women within a specific cultural community.\n\nResearch on the repercussions of gender in toys suggests that play should be encouraged to be more gender neutral in order to work towards a desegregation of the genders. Too, researcher Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach promote that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills. In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children. Even as this debate is evolving and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so than boys because of the societal value of masculinity.\n\nWith toys comprising such a large and important part of human existence, it makes sense that the toy industry would have a substantial economic impact. Sales of toys often increase around holidays where gift-giving is a tradition. Some of these holidays include Christmas, Easter, Saint Nicholas Day, and Three Kings Day.\n\nIn 2005, toy sales in the United States totaled about $22.9 billion. Money spent on children between the ages of 8 and twelve alone totals approximately $221 million annually in the U.S. It was estimated that in 2011, 88% of toy sales was in the age group 0–11 years.\n\nToy companies change and adapt their toys to meet the changing demands of children thereby gaining a larger share of the substantial market. In recent years many toys have become more complicated with flashing lights and sounds in an effort to appeal to children raised around television and the internet. According to Mattel's president, Neil Friedman, \"Innovation is key in the toy industry and to succeed one must create a 'wow' moment for kids by designing toys that have fun, innovative features and include new technologies and engaging content.\"\n\nIn an effort to reduce costs, many mass-producers of toys locate their factories in areas where wages are lower. China manufactures about 70 percent of the world’s toys and is home to more than 8,000 toy firms, most of which are located in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province. 75% of all toys sold in the U.S., for example, are manufactured in China. Issues and events such as power outages, supply of raw materials, supply of labor, and raising wages that impact areas where factories are located often have an enormous impact on the toy industry in importing countries.\n\nMany traditional toy makers have been losing sales to video game makers for years. Because of this, some traditional toy makers have entered the field of electronic games and even turning audio games into toys, and are enhancing the brands that they have by introducing interactive extensions or internet connectivity to their current toys.\n\nIn addition, the rise of distributed manufacturing enables consumers to make their own toys from open source designs with a 3-D printer. As of 2017 consumers were already offsetting 10s of millions of dollars per year by 3D printing their own toys from MyMiniFactory, a single repository.\n\nThe Greek philosopher Plato wrote that the future architect should play at building houses as a child. A construction set is a collection of separate pieces that can be joined together to create models. Popular models to make include cars, spaceships, and houses. The things that are built are sometimes used as toys once completed, but generally speaking, the object is to build things of one's own design, and old models often are broken up and the pieces reused in new models.\n\nThe oldest and, perhaps most common construction toy is a set of simple wooden blocks, which are often painted in bright colors and given to babies and toddlers. Construction sets such as Lego bricks and Lincoln Logs are designed for slightly older children and have been quite popular in the last century. \nConstruction sets appeal to children (and adults) who like to work with their hands, puzzle solvers, and imaginative sorts.\n\nSome other examples include Bayko, Konstruk-Tubes, K'Nex, Erector Sets, Tinkertoys, and Meccano, and generic construction toys such as Neodymium magnet toys.\n\nA doll is a model of a human (often a baby), a humanoid (like Bert and Ernie), or an animal. Modern dolls are often made of cloth or plastic. Other materials that are, or have been, used in the manufacture of dolls include cornhusks, bone, stone, wood, porcelain (sometimes called china), bisque, celluloid, wax, and even apples. Often people will make dolls out of whatever materials are available to them.\n\nSometimes intended as decorations, keepsakes, or collectibles for older children and adults, most dolls are intended as toys for children, usually girls, to play with. Dolls have been found in Egyptian tombs which date to as early as 2000 BC.\n\nDolls are usually miniatures, but baby dolls may be of true size and weight. A doll or stuffed animal of soft material is sometimes called a plush toy or plushie. A popular toy of this type is the Teddy Bear.\n\nA distinction is often made between dolls and action figures, which are generally of plastic or semi-metallic construction and poseable to some extent, and often are merchandising from television shows or films which feature the characters. Modern action figures, such as Action Man, are often marketed towards boys, whereas dolls are often marketed towards girls.\n\nToy soldiers, perhaps a precursor to modern action figures, have been a popular toy for centuries. They allow children to act out battles, often with toy military equipment and a castle or fort. Miniature animal figures are also widespread, with children perhaps acting out farm activities with animals and equipment centered on a toy farm.\n\nChildren have played with miniature versions of vehicles since ancient times, with toy two-wheeled carts being depicted on ancient Greek vases. Wind-up toys have also played a part in the advancement of toy vehicles. Modern equivalents include toy cars such as those produced by Matchbox or Hot Wheels, miniature aircraft, toy boats, military vehicles, and trains. Examples of the latter range from wooden sets for younger children such as BRIO to more complicated realistic train models like those produced by Lionel, Doepke and Hornby. Larger die-cast vehicles, 1:18 scale, have become popular toys; these vehicles are produced with a great attention to detail.\n\nA puzzle is a problem or enigma that challenges ingenuity. Solutions to puzzle may require recognizing patterns and creating a particular order. People with a high inductive reasoning aptitude may be better at solving these puzzles than others. Puzzles based on the process of inquiry and discovery to complete may be solved faster by those with good deduction skills. A popular puzzle toy is the Rubik's Cube, invented by Hungarian Ernő Rubik in 1974. Popularized in the 1980s, solving the cube requires planning and problem-solving skills and involves algorithms.\n\nThere are many different types of puzzles, for example a maze is a type of tour puzzle. Other categories include; construction puzzles, stick puzzles, tiling puzzles, disentanglement puzzles, sliding puzzles, logic puzzles, picture puzzles, lock puzzles and mechanical puzzles.\n\nSome toys, such as Beanie Babies, attract large numbers of enthusiasts, eventually becoming collectibles. Other toys, such as Boyds Bears are marketed to adults as collectibles. Some people spend large sums of money in an effort to acquire larger and more complete collections. The record for a single Pez dispenser at auction, for example, is US$1100.\n\nMany successful films, television programs, books and sport teams have official merchandise, which often includes related toys. Some notable examples are \"Star Wars\" (a space fantasy franchise) and Arsenal, an English football club.\nPromotional toys can fall into any of the other toy categories; for example they can be dolls or action figures based on the characters of movies or professional athletes, or they can be balls, yo-yos, and lunch boxes with logos on them. Sometimes they are given away for free as a form of advertising. Model aircraft are often toys that are used by airlines to promote their brand, just as toy cars and trucks and model trains are used by trucking, railroad and other companies as well. Many food manufacturers run promotions where a toy is included with the main product as a prize. Toys are also used as premiums, where consumers redeem proofs of purchase from a product and pay shipping and handling fees to get the toy. Some people go to great lengths to collect these sorts of promotional toys.\n\nDigital toys are toys that incorporate some form of interactive digital technology. Examples of digital toys include virtual pets and handheld electronic games. Among the earliest digital toys are Mattel Auto Race and the Little Professor, both released in 1976. The concept of using technology in a way that bridges the digital with the physical world, providing unique interactive experiences for the user has also been referred to as \"Phygital.\"\n\nA great many toys are part of active play. These include traditional toys such as hoops, tops, jump ropes and balls, as well as more modern toys like Frisbees, foot bags, astrojax, and Myachi.\n\nPlaying with these sorts of toys allows children to exercise, building strong bones and muscles and aiding in physical fitness. Throwing and catching balls and frisbees can improve hand–eye coordination. Jumping rope, (also known as skipping) and playing with foot bags can improve balance.\n\nMany countries have passed safety standards limiting the types of toys that can be sold. Most of these seek to limit potential hazards, such as choking or fire hazards that could cause injury. Children, especially very small ones, often put toys into their mouths, so the materials used to make a toy are regulated to prevent poisoning. Materials are also regulated to prevent fire hazards. Children have not yet learned to judge what is safe and what is dangerous, and parents do not always think of all possible situations, so such warnings and regulations are important on toys.\n\nFor toy safety, every country has its own regulations. But since the globalization and opening of markets, most of them try to harmonize their regulations. The most common action for younger children is to put toys in their mouths. This is why it is of utmost importance to regulate chemicals which are contained in the paintings and other materials children's products are made of. Countries or trade zones such as the European Union regularly publish lists to regulate the quantities or ban chemicals from toys and juvenile products.\n\nThere have also been issues of toy safety regarding lead paint. Some toy factories, when projects become too large for them to handle, outsource production to other less known factories, often in other countries. Recently, there were some in China that America had to send back. The subcontractors may not be watched as closely and sometimes use improper manufacturing methods. The U.S. government, along with mass market stores, is now moving towards requiring companies to submit their products to testing before they end up on shelves.\n\nWhen toys have been outgrown or are no longer wanted, reuse is sometimes considered. They can be donated via many charities such as Goodwill Industries and the Salvation Army, sold at garage sales, auctioned, sometimes even donated to museums. However, when toys are broken, worn out or otherwise unfit for use, care should be taken when disposing of them. Donated or resold toys should be gently used, clean and have all parts. Before disposal of any battery-operated toy, batteries should be removed and recycled; some communities demand this be done. Some manufacturers, such as Little Tikes, will take back and recycle their products.\n\nIn 2007, massive recalls of toys produced in China led many U.S.-based charities to cut back on, or even discontinue, their acceptance of used toys. Goodwill stopped accepting donations of any toys except stuffed animals, and other charities checked all toys against government-issued checklists.\n\nThe WEEE directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment), which aims at increasing re-use and recycling and reducing electronic waste, applies to toys in the United Kingdom as of 2 January 2007.\n\nIt is not unusual for some animals to play with toys. An example of this is a dolphin being trained to nudge a ball through a hoop. Young chimpanzees use sticks as dolls – the social aspect is seen by the fact that young females more often use a stick this way than young male chimpanzees. They carry their chosen stick and put it in their nest. Such behaviour is also seen in some adult female chimpanzees, but never after they have become mothers.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2820059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2820059", "title": "Urban fiction", "text": "Urban fiction\n\nUrban fiction, also known as street lit or street fiction is a literary genre set in a city landscape; however, the genre is as much defined by the socio-economic realities and culture of its characters as the urban setting. The tone for urban fiction is usually dark, focusing on the underside of city living. Profanity, sex, and violence are usually explicit, with the writer not shying away from or watering-down the material. Most authors of this genre draw upon their past experiences to depict their storylines.\n\nContemporary urban fiction was (and largely still is) a genre written by African Americans. In his famous essay \"The Souls of Black Folk\", W. E. B. Du Bois discussed how a veil separated the African American community from the outside world. By extension, fiction written by people outside the African American culture could not (at least with any degree of verisimilitude) depict the people, settings, and events experienced by people in that culture. Try as some might, those who grew up outside the veil (i.e., outside the urban culture) may find it difficult to write fiction grounded in inner-city and African American life.\n\nCity novels of yesteryear that depict the low-income survivalist realities of city living can also be considered urban fiction or street lit. In her book, \"The Readers' Advisory Guide to Street Literature\" (2011), Vanessa Irvin Morris points out that titles considered canonical or \"classic\" today, could be considered the urban fiction or \"street lit\" of its day.\n\nTitles that depict historical inner-city realities include Stephen Crane's \"\" (1893), Charles Dickens' \"Oliver Twist\" (1838), Paul Laurence Dunbar's \"The Sport of the Gods\" (1902) and Langston Hughes' The Ballad Of The Landlord (1940). In this vein, urban fiction is not just an African American or Latino phenomenon, but rather, the genre exists along a historical continuum that includes stories from diverse cultural and ethnic experiences.\n\nIn the 1970s, during the culmination of the Black Power movement, a jailed Black man named Robert Beck took the pen name Iceberg Slim and wrote \"Pimp\", a dark, gritty tale of life in the inner-city underworld. While the book contained elements of the Black Power agenda, it was most notable for its unsparing depiction of street life.\n\nIceberg Slim wrote many other novels and attained an international following. Some of the terminology he used in his books crossed over into the lexicon of Black English. Other writers included Donald Goines and, notably, Claude Brown's \"Manchild in the Promised Land\", which was published in 1965. Also published that year was \"The Autobiography of Malcolm X\" by Alex Haley\".\" Because Haley's non-fictional read captured the realistic nature of African American urban life for coming-of-age young men, the book has consistently served as a standard for reading among African American teenaged boys.\n\nDuring the 1980s and early 1990s, urban fiction in print experienced a decline. However, one could make a cogent argument that urban tales simply moved from print to music, as hip hop music exploded in popularity. Of course, for every emcee who signed a recording contract and made the airwaves, ten more amateurs plied the streets and local clubs, much like urban bards, griots or troubadours telling urban fiction in an informal, oral manner rather than in a neat, written form.\n\nOne of the most famous emcees, Tupac Shakur, is sometimes called a ghetto prophet and an author of urban fiction in lyrical form. Shakur's early poetry was posthumously compiled into a volume entitled \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\" in 1999.\n\nModern hip-hop literature in print form is a thriving and popular genre. Many non-fiction publications from figures in the hip-hop realm such as Russell Simmons, Kevin Liles, LL Cool J, and FUBU founder Daymond John feature prominently in this genre. Karrine Steffans and shock jock Wendy Williams have written blockbuster books for this audience. Both Steffans and emcee 50 Cent have had such success with their books that they were given their own imprints to usher in similar authors, such as for 50 Cent's G-Unit Books.\n\nToward the end of the 1990s, urban fiction experienced a revival, as demand for novels authentically conveying the urban experience increased, and new business models enabled fledgling writers to more easily bring a manuscript to market and to libraries. One of the first writers in this new cycle of urban fiction was Omar Tyree, who published the novel \"Flyy Girl\" in 1996, reissued as a reprint in 1999.\n\nThe genre gained significant momentum in 1999 with Sister Souljah's bestseller \"The Coldest Winter Ever\". Teri Woods's \"True to the Game\" was also published in 1999, and became the standard from which the entrepreneurial publishing and distribution of contemporary urban fiction took note. The simultaneous publishing of these three novels created a momentum of readership for urban fiction and carried that wave for years. Thus \"The Coldest Winter Ever\", \"True to the Game\", and \"Flyy Girl\" are considered classics in the renaissance of the genre.\n\nSister Souljah describes the untapped market for urban fiction and the stereotypes that held it back in its early years:\n\nIn less than a decade, urban fiction has experienced a renaissance that boasts thousands of titles. The newest wave of street fiction is urban Latino fiction novels such as \"Devil's Mambo\" by Jerry Rodriguez, Chained by Deborah Cardona (a.k.a. Sexy) and Jeff Rivera's \"Forever My Lady\".\n\nMajor writers of contemporary urban fiction include Wahida Clark, Vickie Stringer, Nikki Turner, Kole Black, K'wan, Toy Styles, Kwame Teague, who many believed penned Teri Woods' \"Dutch\", and the writing duo Meesha Mink & De'Nesha Diamond.\n\nThere is also an unexpected literary wave of hip-hop fiction and street lit, which was sparked by Sister Souljah. Authors with a book or books in this offering include Saul Williams, Abiola Abrams, and Felicia Pride. These are hip hop lit or street lit books that take a more literary approach using metaphor, signifying and other literary devices. These books may also be used in socially redeeming or classroom capacities, while maintaining love and positivity for the music and hip hop culture.\n\nWith this new wave of renaissance, \"street lit\" was breaking new ground when it came to promotion and exposure. Aside from hand-to-hand sales, which seems to work best in a genre where word-of-mouth has proven to be worth more than any large ad campaign, the Internet has increased the authors' and publishers' ability to reach out to the genre's readers.\n\nWith Internet savvy, many self-published authors who once had no shot of recognition are now household names, such as author Rasheed Clark, who went from relatively unknown, to being honored with fourteen Infini Literary Award nominations for his first two novels, \"Stories I Wouldn't Tell Nobody But God\" and \"Cold Summer Afternoon\", both of which became instant bestsellers and proved that Clark was a fresh voice in African American fiction, and a leading African-American writer.\n\nAuthors in this genre such as K'wan Foye, Nikki Turner, Toy Styles, Kole Black, are known for bringing street teams and other musical promotion efforts to the book scene. In recent years, some of these authors have joined with hip hop artists such as 50 Cent to further promote the genre by penning the musicians' real-life stories.\n\nIn 2010, the hip hop music label, Cash Money Records, established a publishing branch to their brand, Cash Money Content. However, Cash Money Content's last book, \"Animal 3\", was published in November 2014.\n\nVickie Stringer is an urban lit author, as well as founder and CEO of her own publishing company, Triple Crown Publications, a publisher of 45 novels and 35 writers as of 2008.\n\nForums like AALBC are often used to keep track of the progressive urban fiction genre as it grows tremendously daily.\n\nEarly criticism of street lit was that books were badly edited due to lack of copy editing by independent publishers. However, in recent years the mainstream publishing industry recognized the genre's potential and signed many street lit authors to contracts, thus producing better packaged product. One such author was Treasure E. Blue, according to Kirkus Reviews Magazine, a self-published sensation—it has reportedly sold 65,000 copies before getting signed to a major six-figure deal with Random House Publishing.\n\nThe reach of urban fiction into a large youth readership is undeniable today. Researchers have turned their attention to its influence on urban literacy, particularly among adolescent girls. Despite misgivings about editing quality issues, secondary school teachers in suburban settings have included urban literature in curricula, referring to it as \"multicultural young adult literature\" to expose students to \"authentic\" voices representing urban life.\n\n\n\n\nBecause this genre is very popular with urban teenagers, the following reading lists should prove to be helpful for teachers and librarians.\n"}
{"id": "992991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=992991", "title": "Vowel length", "text": "Vowel length\n\nIn linguistics, vowel length is the perceived duration of a vowel sound. Often the chroneme, or the \"longness\", acts like a consonant, and may have arisen from one etymologically, such as in Australian English. While not distinctive in most other dialects of English, vowel length is an important phonemic factor in many other languages, for instance in\nArabic,\nFinnish,\nFijian, \nKannada,\nJapanese,\nOld English,\nScottish Gaelic\nand\nVietnamese. It plays a phonetic role in the majority of dialects of British English and is said to be phonemic in a few other dialects, such as Australian English, South African English and New Zealand English. It also plays a lesser phonetic role in Cantonese, unlike other varieties of Chinese.\n\nMany languages do not distinguish vowel length phonemically. Those that do usually distinguish between short vowels and long vowels. A very few languages distinguish three phonemic vowel lengths, such as Luiseño and Mixe. However, some languages with two vowel lengths also have words in which long vowels appear adjacent to other short or long vowels of the same type: Japanese \"hōō\" \"phoenix\" or Ancient Greek \"ἀάατος\" \"inviolable\". Some languages that do not ordinarily have phonemic vowel length but permit vowel hiatus may similarly exhibit sequences of identical vowel phonemes that yield \"phonetically\" long vowels, such as Georgian გააადვილებ \"you will facilitate it\".\n\nStress is often reinforced by allophonic vowel length, especially when it is lexical. For example, French long vowels are always in stressed syllables. Finnish, a language with two phonemic lengths, indicates the stress by adding allophonic length, which gives four distinctive lengths and five physical lengths: short and long stressed vowels, short and long unstressed vowels, and a half-long vowel, which is a short vowel found in a syllable immediately preceded by a stressed short vowel: \"i-so\".\n\nAmong the languages with distinctive vowel length, there are some in which it may occur only in stressed syllables, such as in Alemannic German and Egyptian Arabic. In languages such as Czech, Finnish and Classical Latin, vowel length is distinctive also in unstressed syllables.\n\nIn some languages, vowel length is sometimes better analyzed as a sequence of two identical vowels. In Finnic languages, such as Finnish, the simplest example follows from consonant gradation: \"haka → haan\". In some cases, it is caused by a following chroneme, which is etymologically a consonant: \"jää\" \"ice\" ← Proto-Uralic *\"jäŋe\". In non-initial syllables, it is ambiguous if long vowels are vowel clusters; poems written in the Kalevala meter often syllabicate between the vowels, and an (etymologically original) intervocalic \"-h-\" is seen in that and some modern dialects (\"taivaan\" vs. \"taivahan\" \"of the sky\"). Morphological treatment of diphthongs is essentially similar to long vowels. Some old Finnish long vowels have developed into diphthongs, but successive layers of borrowing have introduced the same long vowels again so the diphthong and the long vowel now again contrast (\"nuotti\" \"musical note\" vs. \"nootti\" \"diplomatic note\").\n\nIn Japanese, most long vowels are the results of the phonetic change of diphthongs; \"au\" and \"ou\" became \"ō\", \"iu\" became \"yū\", \"eu\" became \"yō\", and now \"ei\" is becoming \"ē\". The change also occurred after the loss of intervocalic phoneme . For example, modern \"Kyōto\" (Kyoto) has undergone a shift: /kjauto/ → /kjoːto/. Another example is \"shōnen\" (\"boy\"): /seuneɴ/ → /sjoːneɴ/ [ɕoːneɴ].\n\nMany languages make a phonemic distinction between long and short vowels: Arabic, Sanskrit, Japanese, Biblical Hebrew, Finnish, Hungarian, Kannada, etc.\n\nLong vowels may or may not be analyzed as separate phonemes. In Latin and Hungarian, long vowels are analyzed as separate phonemes from short vowels, which doubles the number of vowel phonemes.\nVowel length contrasts with more than two phonemic levels are rare, and several hypothesized cases of three-level vowel length can be analysed without postulating this typologically unusual configuration. Estonian has three distinctive lengths, but the third is suprasegmental, as it has developed from the allophonic variation caused by now-deleted grammatical markers. For example, half-long 'aa' in \"saada\" comes from the agglutination *\"saata+ka\" \"send+(imperative)\", and the overlong 'aa' in \"saada\" comes from *\"saa+ta\" \"get+(infinitive)\". As for languages that have three lengths, independent of vowel quality or syllable structure, these include Dinka, Mixe, Yavapai and Wichita. An example from Mixe is \"guava\", \"spider\", \"knot\". In Dinka the longest vowels are three moras long, and so are best analyzed as overlong etc.\n\nFour-way distinctions have been claimed, but these are actually long-short distinctions on adjacent syllables. For example, in kiKamba, there is , , , \"hit\", \"dry\", \"bite\", \"we have chosen for everyone and are still choosing\".\n\nThe vowels of Received Pronunciation are commonly divided into short and long phonemes. The short vowels are (as in \"kit\"), (as in \"foot\"), (as in \"dress\"), (as in \"strut\"), (as in \"trap\"), (as in \"lot\"), and (as in the first syllable of \"ago\" and in the second of \"sofa\"). The long vowels are (as in \"fleece\"), (as in \"goose\"), (as in \"nurse\"), as in \"north\" and \"thought\", and (as in \"father\" and \"start\"). While a different degree of length is present, there are also differences in the \"quality\" (lax vs tense) of these vowels. In General American, only tenseness is usually distinguished and vowels are transcribed without the length mark.\n\nIn most varieties of English, for instance Received Pronunciation and General American, there is allophonic variation in vowel length: vowels are shortened before fortis consonants but have full length in all other contexts (i.e. word-finally, before lenis consonants, and before nasals and /l/). The process is known as \"pre-fortis clipping\". Thus the vowel in \"bad\" /bæd/ is of normal length but the vowel in \"bat\" /bæt/ is shortened. The clipping effect can result in phonologically long vowels becoming shorter than phonologically short vowels when they occur in pre-fortis position.\n\nIn Australian English, there is contrastive vowel length in closed syllables between long and short and sometimes . The following can be minimal pairs of length for many speakers:\n\nIn English orthography, letters representing vowels in words of the form \"CVC\" and \"CVCe\" are traditionally called \"long\" and \"short\". A vowel letter is called \"long\" if it's pronounced the same as in the letter's name and \"short\" otherwise. This is commonly used for educational purposes when teaching children how to read; however, this system does not cover all vowels of English and the terminology is not linguistic. In phonetic transcription, \"long\" vowels may be marked with a macron; for example, /ā/ may be used to transcribe IPA /eɪ/. This is sometimes used in dictionaries, most notably in Merriam-Webster (see Pronunciation respelling for English for more).\n\nThe phonetic values of \"long\" and \"short\" vowels are represented in the table below:\n\nVowel length may often be traced to assimilation. In Australian English, the second element of a diphthong has assimilated to the preceding vowel, giving the pronunciation of \"bared\" as , creating a contrast with the short vowel in \"bed\" .\n\nAnother common source is the vocalization of a consonant such as the voiced velar fricative or voiced palatal fricative, e.g. Finnish illative case, or even an approximant, as the English 'r'. A historically-important example is the laryngeal theory, which states that long vowels in the Indo-European languages were formed from short vowels, followed by any one of the several \"laryngeal\" sounds of Proto-Indo-European (conventionally written h, h and h). When a laryngeal sound followed a vowel, it was later lost in most Indo-European languages, and the preceding vowel became long. However, Proto-Indo-European had long vowels of other origins as well, usually as the result of older sound changes, such as Szemerényi's law and Stang's law.\n\nVowel length may also have arisen as an allophonic quality of a single vowel phoneme, which may have then become split in two phonemes. For example, the Australian English phoneme was created by the incomplete application of a rule extending before certain voiced consonants, a phenomenon known as the bad–lad split. An alternative pathway to the phonemicization of allophonic vowel length is the shift of a vowel of a formerly-different quality to become the short counterpart of a vowel pair. That too is exemplified by Australian English, whose contrast between (as in \"duck\") and (as in \"dark\") was brought about by a lowering of the earlier .\n\nEstonian, a Finnic language, has a rare phenomenon in which allophonic length variation has become phonemic after the deletion of the suffixes causing the allophony. Estonian had already inherited two vowel lengths from Proto-Finnic, but a third one was then introduced. For example, the Finnic imperative marker *\"-k\" caused the preceding vowels to be articulated shorter. After the deletion of the marker, the allophonic length became phonemic, as shown in the example above.\n\nIn the International Phonetic Alphabet the sign (not a colon, but two triangles facing each other in an hourglass shape; Unicode ) is used for both vowel and consonant length. This may be doubled for an extra-long sound, or the top half () used to indicate a sound is \"half long\". A breve is used to mark an extra-short vowel or consonant.\n\nEstonian has a three-way phonemic contrast:\n\nAlthough not phonemic, the distinction can also be illustrated in certain accents of English:\n\n\n\n\nSome languages make no distinction in writing. This is particularly the case with ancient languages such as Latin and Old English. Modern edited texts often use macrons with long vowels, however. Australian English does not distinguish the vowels from in spelling, with words like ‘span’ or ‘can’ having different pronunciations depending on meaning.\n\nIn non-Latin writing systems, a variety of mechanisms have also evolved.\n\n"}
