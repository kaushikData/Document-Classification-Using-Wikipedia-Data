They stand in contrast to adverbial adjuncts, which can be removed from a sentence without altering its structure or meaning.\n\nAdverbial complements often accompany verbs of caused motion such as \"put\" or \"place\":\n\n\nHowever, they can occur with other types of verbs as well:\n\n\nHead-driven phrase structure grammar describes adverbial complements as part of the verbs' subcategorization frame, which is why they are obligatory arguments. In this theory, adverbial complements are stored in the lexicon as part of the grammatical competence relating to the verb.\n\nAn alternative description, along the lines of construction grammar is that they are parts of certain argument structure constructions – in this case the caused motion construction – which are specifically compatible with the semantics of the verb. Here, adverbial complements are stored in the grammar as part of the caused motion construction which is a sign in its own right.\n\nAnother construction-based theory combines the two arguing that certain senses of verbs co-occur so frequently with certain argument structure constructions, that the argument structures are also stored as part of the grammatical competence relating to the verb. These small argument structure constructions are called mini-constructions. So, in the case of \"put\", in accordance with this theory, adverbial complements are both part of the argument structure construction and stored as information regarding the verb itself.\n\n"}

{"id": "1844932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1844932", "title": "Avoidance speech", "text": "Avoidance speech\n\nAvoidance speech is a group of sociolinguistic phenomena in which a special restricted speech style must be used in the presence of or in reference to certain relatives. Avoidance speech is found in many Australian Aboriginal languages and Austronesian languages as well as some North American languages, Highland East Cushitic languages and Bantu languages.\n\nAvoidance speech styles tend to have the same phonology and grammar as the standard language they are a part of. The lexicon, however, tends to be smaller than in normal speech since the styles are only used for limited communication.\n\nAvoidance speech in Australian Aboriginal languages is closely tied to elaborate tribal kinship systems in which certain relatives are considered taboo. Avoidance relations differ from tribe to tribe in terms of strictness and to whom they apply. Typically, there is an avoidance relationship between a man and his mother-in-law, usually between a woman and her father-in-law, and sometimes between any person and their parent-in-law of the same sex. For some tribes, avoidance relationships are extended to other family members, such as the mother-in-law's brother in Warlpiri or cross-cousins in Dyirbal. All relations are classificatory – more people may fall into the \"mother-in-law\" category than just a man's wife's mother.\n\nAvoidance speech styles used with taboo relatives are often called mother-in-law languages, although they are not actually separate languages but separate lexical sets with the same grammar and phonology. Typically, the taboo lexical set has a one-to-many correspondence with the everyday set. For example, in Dyirbal the avoidance style has one word, \"jijan\", for all lizards and iguanas while the everyday style differentiates many varieties. In Guugu Yimidhirr the avoidance speech verb \"bali-l\" \"travel\" covers several everyday verbs meaning \"go\", \"walk\", \"crawl\", \"paddle\", \"float, sail, drift\", and \"limp along\". Corresponding avoidance and everyday words are generally not linguistically related. Avoidance forms tend to be longer than everyday forms.\n\nIn some areas, the avoidance style is used by both members of the avoidance relationship; in others the older member may talk to the younger in everyday style. Behavior associated with avoidance speech is a continuum and varies between tribes. For the Dyirbal people, a man and his mother-in-law may not make eye contact, face one another or directly talk to each other. Rather, they must address a third person or even a nearby object. For slightly less restricted relationships, such as between a man and his father-in-law, avoidance style is used and must be spoken in a slow, soft voice. An extreme case of avoidance behavior is found in the Umpila, in which a man and his mother-in-law may not speak at all in each other’s presence.\n\nChildren in these cultures acquire avoidance speech forms as part of their normal language development, learning with whom to use them at a fairly young age. Additionally, a few languages have another style, called a \"secret language\" or \"mystic language\", that is taught to boys as part of initiation rituals, and is only used between men.\n\nA special system of avoidance vocabulary is traditionally used by married women speaking Highland East Cushitic languages in southwestern Ethiopia. In Kambaata and Sidamo, this system is called \"ballishsha\", and includes physical and linguistic avoidance of parents-in-law. Women who practice \"ballishsha\" do not pronounce any words beginning with the same syllable as the name of their husband’s mother or father. Instead, they may use paraphrase, synonyms or semantically similar words, antonyms, or borrowings from other languages.\n\n\"Hlonipha\", or \"isihlonipho\", is a traditional system of avoidance speech in Nguni Bantu languages of southern Africa including Zulu, Xhosa and Swazi. This special speech style and correlating respectful behaviors may be used in many contexts, but is most strongly associated with married women in respect to their father-in-law and other senior male relatives. Women who practice \"hlonipha\" may not say the names of these men or any words with the same root as their names. They avoid the taboo words phonologically (substituting sounds) or lexically (substituting words with synonyms, etc.). The \"hlonipha\" system also includes avoidance of the names of certain relatives by all speakers and physical avoidance of certain relatives.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24165760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24165760", "title": "Cañada de la Virgen", "text": "Cañada de la Virgen\n\nCañada de la Virgen is an Otomi archaeological site that has been recently excavated. Located in the Mexican state of Guanajuato, the site was first excavated in 1995, while the official excavation began in 2002.\nPublic access was first allowed in 2011. However, unlike its famous counterparts such as Chichen-Itzá, access is strictly controlled due to it sitting on private property, one of the largest ex-haciendas in Guanajuato.\nThe Otomi people have lived in the valley of San Miguel De Allende for thousands of years. It is presumed that construction at Cañada De La Virgen most likely began after the collapse of the Teotihuacan culture, where they are believed to have previously resided along with other tribes in the Valley of Mexico (near Mexico City today), around 530 AD. The Otomi were avid sky watchers and passed information down from generation to generation. These people used astronomical criteria, religious beliefs and agricultural cycles to select the Laja River Valley for the construction of this Pre-Hispanic burial site. The site faces the celestial north, where the stars spin around in a circle throughout the year. The moon moves up the stairs of the pyramid as its cycle advances. It rises and falls perfectly in pyramid notches at key times in the lunar calendar and during solstice periods.\n\nThe site was ruled by the Moon, the Sun, and Venus, as demonstrated by archaeoastronomical studies conducted by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). Its main features are: Ceremonial Avenue, House of the Wind, House of the Longest Night- scientists believe has some relationship with the Otomi’s belief in the duality of the heavens and earth (Sun and Moon, Man and Woman, etc.), and House of the Thirteen Heavens.\n\nAround 900 AD, the Otomi civilization began to decline and by 1050 AD, the site was abandoned, only to be rediscovered at the end of the 20th century. Work and research continue to this day.\n\nOn site are seven enormous architectonic structures (pyramidal structures) of different sizes and styles, that form sunken patios, squares, a game of ball, esplanades, and a road. Ceramic superficial vestiges found suggest that the last occupation would be tied chronologically to the Toltec expansion.\n\nThis prehispanic settlement is located on the northern Mesoamerican border, its main monuments were sky observatories. Its urban design reflects cosmic cycles linked with farmers’ groups’ life that also were hunter-gatherer in the surrounding semi-desert regions, and traded with other Mesoamerican regions artifacts used in ritual activities.\n\nThe site shares Mesoamerican architectural-oriented patterns, i.e. the symmetry axis is directed to the Sun and Moon rise and setting (East-West), in addition to its strategic position -visual domain of the Laja river basin, where the site is located - determined the pre-Hispanic site importance for rituals and ceremonies.\n\nThe close relationship between the architectural complex construction and star cycles is mainly observed on complex A or \"13 skies House\" vital space for the celestial observation, whose sunken patio functioned as water mirror from which the priests could look at the sky and interpret aspects in the interests for the agricultural cycle.\n\nThe buildings on site are located on a plateau that was artificially filled to obtain an 18° tilt, thus ancient Otomi managed the Sun to pass over various points of the architectural complex, marking calendar dates linked to survival control as well as seeding and harvesting activities.\n\nThe Toltec-Chichimec founded villages, built pyramids and other architectural structures throughout the central basin of the river now called Laja, known as San Miguel in the 16th century, and apparently, a little less than thousand years ago was called Pánuco.\n\nAccording to the list of names appearing in the Toltec - Chichimec Codex, which refers to the various provinces that formed the Toltec Empire, Cañada de la Virgen would be located northwest of the Toltec territory. The name of its capital is unknown, because the name is unreadable in the abovementioned list, everything indicates it is located a few kilometers south of the site in question. It is a city made up of various architectural, elements including a ballgame court and a huge plaza with three pyramid foundations.\n\nFurnaces remains found in the northeast area demonstrate that members of this society were capable of lime stone deposits exploitation. The Seven onsite architectural structures, considered monumental as exceed the human scale, are huge step pyramids with sloped sides of different sizes and styles that form various spaces, such as sunken patios, squares, esplanades, a road.\n\nAccording to surface ceramic vestiges (Plumbate), the last occupation would be linked to the maximum Toltec expansion.\n\nThe historical overview of the region begins in the preclassical period with the Chupícuaro, tradition, very important in Mesoamerica. This tradition is characterized by its advanced ceramic industry and its complex religious expressions, which indicate at an early consolidation of a group in power. The Chupícuaro tradition was established along the banks of rivers and spread to almost the entire Guanajuato territory. Chupícuaro disappeared at about 350 AD., to allow the second tradition of advanced farmers.\n\nAlso identified as the regional development stage, the Sunken Patio tradition covers the classic and epiclassical periods (350 to 900 AD.) It distinguished itself by architectural innovation of sunken or closed patios, associated with pyramidal structures reaching monumental heights. This is considered to be the stage of advanced agricultural development and the expansion of the border northward.\n\nDuring this period Guanajuato developed an organization and work specialization in governing centers. Still heavily argued and linked to the agricultural frontier withdrawal, new hypotheses about Toltec presence propose that it coincided with the arrival of proto-Toltec groups to the Basin of Mexico, between 900 and 1000 AD., and not with the collapse of Tula, Hidalgo, around 1200 AD.\n\nAround 1350 AD., with the collapsed agricultural frontier, these lands were the scene of the development of the Chichimec tribes. With different ethnic affiliation, identified are the guachichiles, guamare, copuces, guaxabanes, pames, and Otomi. At that time, the border between nomadic and sedentary groups was the Lerma River. At this cultural scenario epoch can be placed the prehispanic development of Cañada de la Virgen.\n\nCañada de la Virgen consists of closely linked architectural complexes. Special note for Complex A or “13 Sky House” - critical space for celestial observation - consists of a sunken patio, a pyramidal basement (over 15 m high) and platforms that close to the East, North and South as a whole. Funeral findings in this complex have given rise to forensic studies that have provided information about cultural and cranial deformation, burial, ancestral worship and rituals associated with the foundation of workplace practices. At the top of the complex is the Red Temple and its abstract mural, which are red and black horizontal bands which allude to the day and night.\n\nAs part of the central campus is complex B or “House of the longest night”. It is an architectonic group with several structures (pyramid basement, sunken patio and platforms) which had different functions. An example is the asymmetry of the pyramidal basement (laid out Southwest), which has a room in the South side on the walls. This architectonic type is only documented in the Maya area (Yucatec Puuc) and Cañada de la Virgen. During archaeological excavations in this compound a cross section public functions and rituals substructure with was found.\n\nThe site consists of five groups of monuments, the most important of which is Complex A (side annexes, Temple basement, closed patio, main esplanade, south esplanade and road).\n\nDuring excavations several important archaeological items were found, such as pots (Ollas, metals, seeds, human remains, etc.\n\nThe main square, located west of the site comprises basements A and B, which are the most important. Basement A, with the largest volume and complexity, is composed of different elements: step pyramid, stairways, building or upper temple, central and side patios, esplanade and an avenue.\n\nAs in most cases, the largest volume basement was found at the center, the remainder is distributed in all directions, configuring various squares and esplanades.\n\nSix bodies comprise the pyramidal basement; at the top are remains of a building. The patio geometry in relation to the plaza-esplanade and eastern road denotes the domain reached by the Toltec-Chichimec architects in design and construction. The top building was divided into two sections by a central staircase, similar to late postclassical Aztec structures. It was built with stone walls plastered with mud and stucco (mixture of lime and sand) and painted red oxide (towards its penultimate occupation) and ochre (last). Indicated by remains at the southwest corner of one of the rooms that still exist, miraculously if we consider that in the late 1940s it was dynamited, losing much of northwest side corner.\n\nIt shares characteristics, with some small variations. In this case, the top building is a little to the south, i.e. is not centered with the plaza. To the west is a little elevated esplanade which forms part of the main square. There is some evidence there was another road, which would start at the south side of the basement to another part of the ravine surrounding the site. It is worth noting that in this structure patio remains of a stone anthropomorphic sculpture were found, consistent with what would be the head and left foot of some postclassical individual from the northern center of Mesoamerica.\n\nThis complex has not yet been excavated (as of 2017).\n\nNorth basement, with very special features, such as a mixed base: the bottom base is rectangular, while those at top are circular; this mixture has only been found on very few structures of the region.\n\nThe structure at the south of the complex, comprises a step pyramid basement forming an open patio to the south, unlike the others enclosed on four sides. A piece of stonework that may correspond to a frieze sector or a jamb was detected on the northeast corner of the structure.\n\nThe constant looting and vandalism in the main basement of Complex (A), mainly the large holes at the bottom, on bodies 2 and 3, made necessary in 1989 to make some partial restoration interventions (architectural volumetric restitution) to prevent the collapse of the southwest corner of the basement, the upper bodies stability was compromised.\n\nThe archaeological complex opened to the public on February 15, 2011. The site is open Tuesday through Sunday, from 9 am to 3 pm. For those without transportation or seeking bilingual guides, there are multiple tour operators in San Miguel de Allende that can provide expert guides and transportation.\n\nThe site is unusually protected and there are some considerations for visitors. There is a Visitor Center with parking and a museum (opened in 2017). Access to the site is only by a scheduled shuttle bus which takes visitors near the site. From there, the walk is roughly 3 km round trip, and you must be accompanied by an escort who will ensure that you return to your shuttle bus on schedule; round trip time from the Visitor Center is 2.5 hrs. No bags, backpacks or purses are allowed into the site because of recent thefts of artifacts. Small camera bags, cameras, and water are allowed. Visitors with mobility issues may find the tour challenging.\n\n"}

{"id": "2062976", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2062976", "title": "Eastern religions", "text": "Eastern religions\n\nThe Eastern religions are the religions originating in East, South and Southeast Asia and thus having dissimilarities with Western religions. This includes the East Asian religions (Shintoism, Sindoism, Taoism and Confucianism), Indian religions (Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism) as well as animistic indigenous religions.\n\nThis East-West religious distinction, just as with the East-West culture distinction, and the implications that arise from it, is broad and not precise. Furthermore, the geographical distinction has less meaning in the current context of global transculturation.\n\nWhile many Western observers attempt to distinguish between Eastern philosophies and religions, this is a distinction that does not exist in some Eastern traditions.\n\nReligions originating in the Indian subcontinent include Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. The theologies and philosophies of these religions have several concepts in common, such as \"dharma\", \"karma\", \"maya\" and \"samsara\".\n\nHinduism originated on the Indian subcontinent. It is considered by some to be the world's oldest extant major religion. Hinduism contains a vast body of scripture, divided as revealed and remembered, expounding on dharma, or religious living. Hindus consider the \"Vedas\" and the \"Upanishads\" as being among the foremost in authority, importance and antiquity. The \"\", a treatise excerpted from the \"\", is sometimes called a summary of the spiritual teachings of the \"Vedas\". It is difficult to identify any universal belief or practice in Hinduism, although prominent themes include: \"Dharma\", \"Samsara\", \"Karma\", and \"Moksha\". Hinduism is sometimes called a polytheistic religion, but this is an oversimplification. Hinduism includes a diverse collection of schools whose beliefs span monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, monism and even atheism. For instance, the Advaita Vedanta school holds that there is only one causal entity (Brahman), which manifests itself into all the various living and non-living forms that we observe, whereas traditions such as Vaishnavism and Shaivism worship Vishnu and Shiva in a relatively more monotheistic sense (caused by a differentiation between the parabrahman and atman). A number of scholars even consider the Samkhya school of thought to have atheistic leanings.\n\nBuddhism is a nontheistic Indian religion and philosophy. Buddhism was founded around the 5th century BCE in India by Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, with the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path as its central principles. According to the scriptures, the Four Noble Truths were revealed by the Buddha in his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. The schools of Buddhism are typically divided into Theravada and Mahayana. In academic circles, Mahayana is further divided into East Asian and Tibetan Buddhism. Buddhism teaches that someone who becomes enlightened without instruction is a buddha. The primary goal of Buddhism is the liberation of the practitioner from samsara. Buddhists hold this to be the solution to the problem of suffering.\n\nJainism is the religion of the followers of Mahavira. He is said to be the 24th Tirthankara, or the 24th in a line of teachers espousing Jain principles. Jains reject the Vedas and highlight the practice of austerity. Jain philosophy states that the jiva, or soul, can escape the cycle of rebirth and death through strict ethical behavior. When nothing remains but the purity of the jiva, that person is called a \"jina\", or winner, which is the origin of the term Jain. Karma is viewed as an accumulation that burdens the soul, causing attachment and suffering. Ahimsa, or non-violence, is central to Jain faith, philosophy and practice. It is interpreted very strictly as prohibiting all forms of harm to other living beings. Due to this, Jainism requires a strict vegetarian lifestyle. \"Ahimsa\" also applies to speaking, as one's words can cause harm and suffering.\n\nSikhism is a religion which began in Punjab of Northern India. It is founded on the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev and the nine human gurus that followed. He received a vision to preach the way to enlightenment and God in Sultanpur. His views rejected the traditional worships and caste of the Hindu faith. Freedom from reincarnation is tied to remembrance and repetition on one universal God. God is formless and simultaneously in every form. Sikhs believe that there is one universal God who is the ultimate creator, sustainer, and destroyer. The Gurū Granth Sāhib are the central scriptures intended to preserve hymns and the teachings of the Sikh Gurus and other saints from Hindu and Sufi traditions. Rituals, religious ceremonies or empty worship are considered of little use and Sikhs are discouraged from fasting or going on pilgrimages. The tenets of Sikhism include (1) honest living/earning (2) tithing and giving alms (3) chanting on God. Sikhism also has a strong warrior tradition which arose in defense of religious freedom and human rights from a tyrannical Moghul occupation of India.\n\nThe group of East Asian religions or philosophies share the concept of Tao. They may be considered as forming a group within world religions comparable to the Abrahamic or Dharmic groups. The Taoic faiths claim at least 500 million members worldwide.\n\nTaoism, also known as Daoism, comprises a variety of related religious and philosophical traditions. Categorization of Taoist sects and movements is very controversial. Taoist propriety and ethics places an emphasis on the Three Jewels of the Tao; love, moderation, humility. Taoist theology focuses on doctrines of wu wei (\"non-action\"), spontaneity, humanism, relativism and emptiness. \n\nMost traditional Chinese Taoists are polytheistic. There are disagreements regarding the proper composition of this pantheon. Popular Taoism typically presents the Jade Emperor as the head deity. Intellectual, or \"elite\", Taoism usually presents Laozi and the Three Pure Ones at the top of the pantheon. Nature and ancestor spirits are common in popular Taoism. But this sort of shamanism is eschewed for an emphasis on internal alchemy among the \"elite\" Taoists. Tao itself is rarely an object of worship, being treated more like the South Asian concept of atman.\n\nShinto is an animistic folk religion practiced in Japan. Shinto literally means \"the way of the gods\". Many Japanese Shintoists also identify themselves as Buddhists. Japanese Pure Land Buddhism is deeply intertwined with the Shinto faith. Shinto practitioners commonly affirm tradition, family, nature, cleanliness and ritual observation as core values. Taoic influence is significant in their beliefs about nature and self-mastery.\n\nRitual cleanliness is a central part of Shinto life. Shrines have a significant place in Shintoism, reflecting the animistic veneration of the kami. \"Folk\", or \"popular\", Shinto places an emphasis on shamanism, particularly divination, spirit possession and faith healing. \"Sect\" Shinto is a diverse group including mountain-worshippers and Confucian Shintoists.\n\nConfucianism is a complex system of moral, social and political thought, influential in the history of East Asia. It is debatable whether Confucianism is a religion or simply an ethical system. It is commonly associated with legalism but it rejects legalism for ritualism. It also endorses meritocracy as the ideal of nobility. Confucianism has a complicated system governing duties and etiquette in relationships. Confucian ethics focus on familial duty, loyalty and humaneness. \n\nConfucianism tolerates the Chinese folk recognition of the existence of animistic spirits, ghosts and deities. It approves paying them proper respect, but at a more fundamental level encourages avoiding them. Confucian thought is notable as the framework upon which the syncretic Neo-Confucianism was built.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11114", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11114", "title": "Fiqh", "text": "Fiqh\n\nFiqh (; ) is Islamic jurisprudence. \"Fiqh\" is often described as the human understanding of the \"sharia,\" that is human understanding of the divine Islamic law as revealed in the Quran and the \"Sunnah\" (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad). Fiqh expands and develops Shariah through interpretation (\"ijtihad\") of the Quran and \"Sunnah\" by Islamic jurists (\"ulama\") and is implemented by the rulings (\"fatwa\") of jurists on questions presented to them. Thus, whereas \"sharia\" is considered immutable and infallible by Muslims, \"fiqh\" is considered fallible and changeable. \"Fiqh\" deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. In the modern era, there are four prominent schools (\"madh'hab\") of \"fiqh\" within Sunni practice, plus two (or three) within Shi'a practice. A person trained in \"fiqh\" is known as a \"faqīh\" (plural \"fuqaha\").\n\nFiguratively, \"fiqh\" means knowledge about Islamic legal rulings from their sources and deriving religious rulings from their sources necessitates the \"mujtahid\" (an individual who exercises \"ijtihad\") to have a deep understanding in the different discussions of jurisprudence. A \"faqīh\" must look deep down into a matter and not suffice himself with just the apparent meaning, and a person who only knows the appearance of a matter is not qualified as a \"faqīh\".\n\nThe studies of \"fiqh\", are traditionally divided into \"Uṣūl al-fiqh\" (principles of Islamic jurisprudence, lit. the roots of fiqh), the methods of legal interpretation and analysis; and \"Furūʿ al-fiqh\" (lit. the branches of fiqh), the elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles. \"Furūʿ al-fiqh\" is the product of the application of \"Uṣūl al-fiqh\" and the total product of human efforts at understanding the divine will. A \"hukm\" (plural \"aḥkām\") is a particular ruling in a given case.\n\nThe word \"fiqh\" is an Arabic term meaning \"deep understanding\" or \"full comprehension\". Technically it refers to the body of Islamic law extracted from detailed Islamic sources (which are studied in the principles of Islamic jurisprudence) and the process of gaining knowledge of Islam through jurisprudence. The historian Ibn Khaldun describes \"fiqh\" as \"knowledge of the rules of God which concern the actions of persons who own themselves connected to obey the law respecting what is required (\"wajib\"), sinful (\"haraam\"), recommended (\"mandūb\"), disapproved (\"makrūh\") or neutral (\"mubah\")\". This definition is consistent amongst the jurists.\n\nIn Modern Standard Arabic, \"fiqh\" has come to mean jurisprudence in general, be it Islamic or secular. It is thus possible to speak of Chief Justice John Roberts as an expert in the common law \"fiqh\" of the United States, or of Egyptian legal scholar Abd El-Razzak El-Sanhuri as an expert in the civil law \"fiqh\" of Egypt.\n\nThe history of Islamic jurisprudence is \"customarily divided into eight periods\":\nThe formative period of Islamic jurisprudence stretches back to the time of the early Muslim communities. In this period, jurists were more concerned with issues of authority and teaching than with theory and methodology.\n\nProgress in theory and methodology happened with the coming of the early Muslim jurist Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i (767–820), who codified the basic principles of Islamic jurisprudence in his book \"ar-Risālah\". The book details the four roots of law (Qur'an, Sunnah, \"ijma\", and \"qiyas\") while specifying that the primary Islamic texts (the Qur'an and the hadith) be understood according to objective rules of interpretation derived from scientific study of the Arabic language.\n\nSecondary sources of law were developed and refined over the subsequent centuries, consisting primarily of juristic preference (\"istihsan\"), laws of the previous prophets (\"shara man qablana\"), continuity (\"istishab\"), extended analogy (\"maslaha mursala\"), blocking the means (\"sadd al-dhari'ah\"), custome \"urf\" and saying of a companion (\"qawl al-sahabi\").\n\nThe Quran set the rights, the responsibilities and the rules for people and for societies to adhere to, like not dealing in interest. Muhammad then provided an example, which is recorded in the hadith books, showing people how he practically implemented these rules in a society. After the passing of Muhammad, there was a need for jurists, to decide on new legal matters where there is no such ruling in the Quran or the Hadith, example of Islamic prophet Muhammad regarding a similar case.\n\nIn the years proceeding Muhammad, the community in Madina continued to use the same rules. People were familiar with the practice of Muhammad and therefore continued to use the same rules.\n\nThe scholars appearing in the diagram below were taught by Muhammad's companions, many of whom settled in Madina. Muwatta by Malik ibn Anas was written as a consensus of the opinion, of these scholars. The Muwatta by Malik ibn Anas quotes 13 hadiths from Imam Jafar al-Sadiq.\n\nMuch of the knowledge we have about Muhammad is narrated through Aisha the wife of Muhammad, also a renowned scholar of her time. Aisha raised and taught her nephew Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr after her brother Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was killed by the Syrians.\n\nQasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's mother was from Ali's family and Qasim's daughter Farwah bint al-Qasim was married to Muhammad al-Baqir and was the mother of Jafar al-Sadiq. Therefore, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grandson of Abu Bakr the first caliph and the grandfather of Jafar al-Sadiq whose views the twelver Shias follow. The twelver Shia do not accept Abu Bakr as the first caliph but do accept his great-great-grandson Jafar al-Sadiq.\n\nAisha also taught her nephew Urwah ibn Zubayr. He then taught his son Hisham ibn Urwah, who was the main teacher of Malik ibn Anas whose views many Sunni follow and also taught Jafar al-Sadiq. Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Hisham ibn Urwah and Muhammad al-Baqir taught Zayd ibn Ali, Jafar al-Sadiq, Abu Hanifa, and Malik ibn Anas.\n\nImam Jafar al-Sadiq, Imam Abu Hanifa and Malik ibn Anas worked together in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina. Along with Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr, Muhammad al-Baqir, Zayd ibn Ali and over 70 other leading jurists and scholars.\n\nAl-Shafi‘i was taught by Malik ibn Anas. Ahmad ibn Hanbal was taught by Al-Shafi‘i. Muhammad al-Bukhari travelled everywhere collecting hadith and his father Ismail ibn Ibrahim was a student of Malik ibn Anas.\n\nIn the books actually written by these original jurists and scholars, there are very few theological and judicial differences between them. Imam Ahmad rejected the writing down and codifying of the religious rulings he gave. They knew that they might have fallen into error in some of their judgements and stated this clearly. They never introduced their rulings by saying, \"Here, this judgement is the judgement of God and His prophet.\" There is also very little text actually written down by Jafar al-Sadiq himself. They all give priority to the Qur'an and the Hadith (the practice of Muhammad). They felt that the Quran and the Hadith, the example of Muhammad provided people with almost everything they needed. \"This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion\" Quran 5:3.\n\nThese scholars did not distinguish between each other. They were not Sunni or Shia. They felt that they were following the religion of Abraham as described in the Quran \"Say: Allah speaks the truth; so follow the religion of Abraham, the upright one. And he was not one of the polytheists\" (Qur'an 3:95).\n\nMost of the differences are regarding Sharia laws devised through Ijtihad where there is no such ruling in the Quran or the Hadiths of Islamic prophet Muhammad regarding a similar case. As these jurists went to new areas, they were pragmatic and continued to use the same ruling as was given in that area during pre-Islamic times, if the population felt comfortable with it, it was just and they used Ijtihad to deduce that it did not conflict with the Quran or the Hadith. As explained in the Muwatta by Malik ibn Anas. This made it easier for the different communities to integrate into the Islamic State and assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State.\n\nTo reduce the divergence, ash-Shafi'i proposed giving priority to the Qur'an and the Hadith (the practice of Muhammad) and only then look at the consensus of the Muslim jurists (\"ijma\") and analogical reasoning (\"qiyas\"). This then resulted in jurists like Muhammad al-Bukhari dedicating their lives to the collection of the correct Hadith, in books like Sahih al-Bukhari. Sahih translates as authentic or correct. They also felt that Muhammad's judgement was more impartial and better than their own.\n\nThese original jurists and scholars also acted as a counterbalance to the rulers. When they saw injustice, all these scholars spoke out against it. As the state expanded outside Madina, the rights of the different communities, as they were constituted in the Constitution of Medina still applied. The Quran also gave additional rights to the citizens of the state and these rights were also applied. Ali, Hassan and Hussein ibn Ali gave their allegiance to the first three caliphs because they abided by these conditions. Later Ali the fourth caliph wrote in a letter \"I did not approach the people to get their oath of allegiance but they came to me with their desire to make me their Amir (ruler). I did not extend my hands towards them so that they might swear the oath of allegiance to me but they themselves extended their hands towards me\". But later as fate would have it (Predestination in Islam) when Yazid I, an oppressive ruler took power, Hussein ibn Ali the grandson of Muhammad felt that it was a test from God for him and his duty to confront him. Then Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr's cousin confronted the Umayyad rulers after Hussein ibn Ali was betrayed by the people of Kufa and killed by Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the Yazid I the Umayyad ruler. Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr then took on the Umayyads and expelled their forces from Hijaz and Iraq. But then his forces were depleted in Iraq, trying to stop the Khawarij. The Ummayads then moved in. After a lengthy campaign, in his last hour Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr asked his mother Asma' bint Abu Bakr the daughter of Abu Bakr the first caliph for advice. Asma' bint Abu Bakr replied to her son, she said: \"You know better in your own self, that if you are upon the truth and you are calling towards the truth go forth, for people more honourable than you have been killed and if you are not upon the truth, then what an evil son you are and you have destroyed yourself and those who are with you. If you say, that if you are upon the truth and you will be killed at the hands of others, then you will not truly be free\". Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the Umayyads and led by Hajjaj. Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr the son of Abu Bakr the first caliph and raised by Ali the fourth caliph was also killed by the Ummayads. Aisha then raised and taught his son Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr who later taught his grandson Jafar al-Sadiq.\n\nDuring the early Ummayad period, there was more community involvement. The Quran and Muhammad's example was the main source of law after which the community decided. If it worked for the community, was just and did not conflict with the Quran and the example of Muhammad, it was accepted. This made it easier for the different communities, with Roman, Persian, Central Asia and North African backgrounds to integrate into the Islamic State and that assisted in the quick expansion of the Islamic State. The scholars in Madina were consulted on the more complex judicial issues. The Sharia and the official more centralized schools of fiqh developed later, during the time of the Abbasids.\n\nThe sources of \"fiqh\" in order of importance are\nThe Qur'an gives clear instructions on many issues, such as how to perform the ritual purification (') before the obligatory daily prayers ('), but on other issues, some Muslims believe the Qur'an alone is not enough to make things clear. For example, the Qur'an states one needs to engage in daily prayers (') and fast (') during the month of Ramadan but Muslims believe they need further instructions on how to perform these duties. Details about these issues can be found in the traditions of Muhammad, so Qur'an and Sunnah are in most cases the basis for (\"\").\n\nSome topics are without precedent in Islam's early period. In those cases, Muslim jurists (') try to arrive at conclusions by other means. Sunni jurists use historical consensus of the community ('); a majority in the modern era also use analogy (') and weigh the harms and benefits of new topics ('), and a plurality utilizes juristic preference ('). The conclusions arrived at with the aid of these additional tools constitute a wider array of laws than the Sharia consists of, and is called fiqh. Thus, in contrast to the \"sharia\", \"fiqh\" is not regarded as sacred and the schools of thought have differing views on its details, without viewing other conclusions as sacrilegious. This division of interpretation in more detailed issues has resulted in different schools of thought (').\n\nThis wider concept of Islamic jurisprudence is the source of a range of laws in different topics that guide Muslims in everyday life.\n\nIslamic jurisprudence (\"fiqh\") covers two main areas:\n\nThese types of rules can also fall into two groups:\n\nRules in relation to actions (\"'amaliyya\" — عملية) or \"decision types\" comprise:\n\nRules in relation to circumstances (\"wadia\"') comprise:\n\nThe modus operandi of the Muslim jurist is known as \"usul al-fiqh\" (\"principles of jurisprudence\").\n\nThere are different approaches to the methodology used in jurisprudence to derive Islamic law from the primary sources. The main methodologies are those of the Sunni, Shi'a and Ibadi denominations. While both Sunni and Shi'ite (Shia) are divided into smaller sub-schools, the differences among the Shi'ite schools is considerably greater. Ibadites only follow a single school without divisions.\n\nWhile using court decisions as legal precedents and case law are central to Western law, the importance of the institution of fatawa (non-binding answers by Islamic legal scholars to legal questions) has been called \"central to the development\" of Islamic jurisprudence. This is in part because of a \"vacuum\" in the other source of Islamic law, \"qada`\" (legal rulings by state appointed Islamic judges) after the fall of the last caliphate the Ottoman Empire. While the practice in Islam dates back to the time of Muhammad, according to at least one source (Muhammad El-Gamal), it is \"modeled after the Roman system of \"responsa\",\" and gives the questioner \"decisive primary-mover advantage in choosing he question and its wording.\"\n\nEach school (\"madhhab\") reflects a unique \"al-urf\" or culture (a cultural practice that was influenced by traditions), that the classical jurists themselves lived in, when rulings were made. Some suggest that the discipline of \"isnad\", which developed to validate \"hadith\" made it relatively easy to record and validate also the rulings of jurists. This, in turn, made them far easier to imitate (\"taqlid\") than to challenge in new contexts. The argument is, the schools have been more or less frozen for centuries, and reflect a culture that simply no longer exists. Traditional scholars hold that religion is there to regulate human behavior and nurture people's moral side and since human nature has not fundamentally changed since the beginning of Islam a call to modernize the religion is essentially one to relax all laws and institutions.\n\nEarly \"shariah\" had a much more flexible character, and some modern Muslim scholars believe that it should be renewed, and that the classical jurists should lose special status. This would require formulating a new fiqh suitable for the modern world, e.g. as proposed by advocates of the Islamization of knowledge, which would deal with the modern context. This modernization is opposed by most conservative \"ulema\". Traditional scholars hold that the laws are contextual and consider circumstance such as time, place and culture, the principles they are based upon are universal such as justice, equality and respect. Many Muslim scholars argue that even though technology may have advanced, the fundamentals of human life have not.\n\nThere are several schools of fiqh thought ( '; pl. ')\n\nThe schools of Sunni Islam are each named by students of the classical jurist who taught them. The Sunni schools (and where they are commonly found) are\n\nThe schools of Shia Islam comprise:\n\nEntirely separate from both the Sunni and Shia traditions, Khawarij Islam has evolved its own distinct school.\n\nThese schools share many of their rulings, but differ on the particular hadiths they accept as authentic and the weight they give to analogy or reason (qiyas) in deciding difficulties.\n\nThe relationship between (at least the Sunni) schools of jurisprudence and the conflict between the unity of the Shariah and the diversity of the schools, was expressed by the 12th century Hanafi scholar Abu Hafs Umar an-Nasafi, who wrote: `Our school is correct with the possibility of error, and another school is in error with the possibility of being correct.”\n\nA number of important legal institutions were developed by Muslim jurists during the classical period of Islam, known as the Islamic Golden Age. One such institution was the \"Hawala\", an early informal value transfer system, which is mentioned in texts of Islamic jurisprudence as early as the 8th century. \"Hawala\" itself later influenced the development of the agency in common law and in civil laws such as the \"aval\" in French law and the \"avallo\" in Italian law. The \"European commenda\" (Islamic \"Qirad\") used in European civil law may have also originated from Islamic law.\n\nThe \"Waqf\" in Islamic law, which developed during the 7th–9th centuries, bears a notable resemblance to the trusts in the English trust law. For example, every \"Waqf\" was required to have a \"waqif\" (settlor), \"mutawillis\" (trustee), \"qadi\" (judge) and beneficiaries. The trust law developed in England at the time of the Crusades, during the 12th and 13th centuries, was introduced by Crusaders who may have been influenced by the \"Waqf\" institutions they came across in the Middle East.\n\nThe Islamic \"lafif\" was a body of twelve members drawn from the neighbourhood and sworn to tell the truth, who were bound to give a unanimous verdict, about matters \"which they had personally seen or heard, binding on the judge, to settle the truth concerning facts in a case, between ordinary people, and obtained as of right by the plaintiff.\" The only characteristic of the English jury which the Islamic \"lafif\" lacked was the \"judicial writ directing the jury to be summoned and directing the bailiff to hear its recognition.\" According to Professor John Makdisi, \"no other institution in any legal institution studied to date shares all of these characteristics with the English jury.\" It is thus likely that the concept of the \"lafif\" may have been introduced to England by the Normans, who conquered both England and the Emirate of Sicily, and then evolved into the modern English jury.\n\nSeveral other fundamental common law institutions may have been adapted from similar legal institutions in Islamic law and jurisprudence, and introduced to England by the Normans after the Norman conquest of England and the Emirate of Sicily, and by Crusaders during the Crusades. In particular, the \"royal English contract protected by the action of debt is identified with the Islamic \"Aqd\", the English assize of novel disseisin is identified with the Islamic \"Istihqaq\", and the English jury is identified with the Islamic \"lafif\".\" Other English legal institutions such as \"the scholastic method, the licence to teach\", the \"law schools known as Inns of Court in England and \"Madrasas\" in Islam\" and the \"European commenda\" (Islamic \"Qirad\") may have also originated from Islamic law. The methodology of legal precedent and reasoning by analogy (\"Qiyas\") are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems. These influences have led some scholars to suggest that Islamic law may have laid the foundations for \"the common law as an integrated whole\".\n\n"}

The Fowler is located in the northern part of UCLA's Westwood Campus, adjacent to Royce Hall and Glorya Kaufman Hall.\n\nThe museum is operated under the jurisdiction of UCLA School of the Arts and Architecture (UCLA Arts).\n\nThe museum was established in 1963 by then UCLA Chancellor Franklin D. Murphy as the Museum and Laboratories of Ethnic Arts and Technology. Its first home was in the basement of Haines Hall on the UCLA campus. The goal of this new museum was to consolidate the various collections of non-Western art and artifacts on campus. In addition to active collecting, the museum initiated research projects, fieldwork, exhibitions and publications.\n\nIn 1971 the name was changed to the Museum of Cultural History and by 1975 its collections, in numbers and in quality, ranked it among the top four university museums in the country, a stature it retains to the present day. \n\nIn 1981, Chancellor Charles E. Young, along with museum director, Christopher B. Donnan, developed a vision for a new building that would fully exhibit the immense collection. The $22-million structure, designed by architects Arnold C. Savrann and John Carl Warnecke, was funded by both private gifts and state resources. The large facility called the Fowler Museum of Cultural History opened on September 30, 1992, named in recognition of lead support by the Fowler Foundation and the family of collector and inventor Francis E. Fowler Jr. In 2006 the name of the Museum was formally changed to the Fowler Museum at UCLA.\n\nIn the fall of 2013, the Museum launched its fiftieth anniversary celebration with a night of festivities and the opening of eight special exhibitions from its global collections. The eight exhibitions, which ran through winter and spring of 2014, were:\nIn addition to these exhibitions, the Fowler also exhibited new and promised gifts of art inside the rotating Fowler in Focus gallery, and presented \"Walk among Worlds\", an installation by artist Máximo González composed of thousands of beach ball globes.\n\nThe Fowler's collections comprise more than 120,000 art and ethnographic and 600,000 archaeological objects representing ancient, traditional, and contemporary cultures of Africa, Native and Latin America, and Asia and the Pacific. From Yoruba beaded arts of Southern Nigeria, to pre-Columbian ceramic vessels of Peru, to elaborate batik textiles of Indonesia and the vibrant papier-mâché sculptures of Mexico, the Fowler's collections offer a comprehensive resource for exhibitions and scholarship central to the Museum's mandate.\nThe majority of the Museum's holdings has been acquired via the generosity of individuals—researchers, scholars, and dedicated collectors—who have enabled the Fowler to build its world-class collections. The Sir Henry Wellcome Collection of 30,000 objects, assembled early in the last century by Wellcome and given to the Museum in 1965, forms the core of our African and Pacific holdings and represents the single largest gift. More than 15,000 textiles trace the history of cloth over two millennia and across five continents. \nObjects from the Fowler Family Silver Collection include 400 works representing 16th- through 19th-century Europe and the United States. Among these are vessels from the renowned workshops of Paul de Lamerie, Karl Fabergé, and Paul Revere. In 1969, Hollywood actress Natalie Wood donated a remarkable collection of ancient Chupícuaro Mexican ceramics to the Fowler Museum. Later in 2013, the Fowler Museum received several gift in honor of its fiftieth anniversity. One gift estimated to be worth around $14 million, from collector and Silicon Valley pioneer Jay Last and his wife, Deborah. As reported by the Los Angeles Times, the gift consisted of 92 wood and ivory objects from the Lega people of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nMost of the holdings has been collected in the field and systematically documented, providing essential contextual information. Maintaining geographical scope and artistic variety and building on existing strengths continue to be guiding principles in acquisitions decisions. For example, as the Museum augments its programming to meet the interests of the city's growing Latin American population, collection activities in this area have increased. An exceptional collection of more than 900 Mexican works was donated in 1997 by the Daniel Family and includes magnificent ceramic Trees of Life, Day of the Dead figurines, and masks from Metepec, Oaxaca, Michoacan, Jalisco, Puebla, and Guanajuato.\n\nOffered throughout the year, the Fowler's public programs are designed to reflect and complement its dynamic exhibition program, as well as highlight the Museum's world-renowned collection of art from Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and the Americas. Public programs at the Fowler Museum are typically free and open to the public, unless otherwise noted.\n\nCurrent and ongoing exhibitions provide the starting point for programming that touches upon scholarly as well as general interest topics. The signature series, Fowler OutSpoken, features speakers in a lecture, conversation, or panel format, and provides audiences with access to emerging and established artists, curators, scholars, performers, and other cultural figures.\n\nThe Fowler offers educational and entertaining events throughout the year showcasing world music and performances by local and international artists. Fowler Out Loud is the museum's performance series that takes place on Thursday nights throughout the academic school year and features international music, dance, poetry, theater, and performance art by UCLA students.\n\nFrom artist walkthroughs to monthly Culture Fix gallery chats, the Fowler offers numerous opportunities to engage with its exhibitions. In-depth study programs and the museum's signature Fowler on the Town series feature site visits to places of interest in Los Angeles and surrounding areas.\n\nThe Fowler presents film screenings throughout the year. The Fowler offers documentaries and features that relate to current exhibitions.Cooking programs, hands-on demonstrations, and dance and yoga are offered on occasion.\n\nThe primary mission of the Fowler's Education Department is to strengthen global arts and humanities education by helping to increase understanding of our world's cultural and artistic traditions.\n\nThe Fowler Museum invites K-12 students to experience global arts during self-guided and guided tours. This program serves students of all ages and abilities.\n\nThe Fowler Museum also presents diverse professional development offerings and resources for teachers, including curricular materials, professional development workshops, and intensive Teacher Institutes.\n\nA dynamic center for research and dialogue, the Fowler Museum serves as a cultural gateway linking UCLA to the world beyond. The Fowler Museum’s university programs offer many opportunities for UCLA faculty, staff, and students to engage with global arts. Such programs range from student internships, to interdisciplinary class visits, to student-led performances.\n\nFamily programs at the Fowler Museum are designed to encourage families of all types to slow down, look closely at original works of art, and work together to engage with global arts.\n\n\nMarla C. Berns has served as the director of the Fowler Museum at UCLA since 2001. Previously Doran H. Ross, who succeeded Christopher B. Donnan (1981-1996), served as the museum director from 1996 to 2001. One of the most significant initiatives that Berns has launched as director came to fruition in 2006 with the opening of \"Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives\", the Museum's first long-term exhibition of highlights from its renowned permanent collection. The exhibition features a unique thematic and cross-cultural approach and incorporates a wide range of technologies, and has become a staple for K-12 and college-level multicultural education in the Los Angeles area, as well as a favorite stop for general museum visitors interested in world arts.\n\nIn addition to continuing the Fowler's pioneering work in the presentation of global arts and cultures, Berns has encouraged the presentation of the work of contemporary artists in exhibitions that speak to both the ongoing dynamism of world cultures and to the resonances between contemporary art and traditional practices. To that end, the Fowler has presented several much-praised solo exhibitions, including the work of the celebrated Ghanaian artist El Anatsui (2007), Cuban-born artist José Bedia (2011), San Francisco-based performance and photo-conceptual artist Allan deSouza (2011), and the riotous \"Soundsuits of Nick Cave\" (2010), one of the Fowler's most popular exhibitions to date.\n\nIn 2007, her position was endowed by a $1 million donation from Los Angeles philanthropists Shirley and Ralph Shapiro in recognition of her outstanding contributions to UCLA and the community. In 2013, Berns received the medal of Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters of the French Republic in a ceremony conducted by Stéphane Martin, president of the Quai Branly Museum. The ceremony took place at the Quai Branly Museum in Paris on Tues., Nov 12, at the opening of \"Secrets d'ivoire: L'art des Lega d'Afrique centrale\", an exhibition of the Fowler Museum's unparalleled collection of African artwork by the Lega peoples of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which was donated to the Fowler by collectors Jay T. and Deborah R. Last.\n\n"}

He is widely regarded as one of the founders of paleobiology and Albanian studies.\n\nNopcsa was born in 1877 in Transylvania, which at that time was part of Austria-Hungary, to the Nopcsa aristocratic family of magyarised Romanian origin. In 1895 Nopcsa's younger sister Ilona discovered dinosaur bones at the family estate at Szentpéterfalva in Săcel (Szacsal), Transylvania. This led to Nopcsa's enrollment at the University of Vienna to study the fossilized bones. He advanced quickly in his studies; he gave his first academic lecture at the age of twenty-two.\n\nIn addition to Mesozoic reptiles, Nopcsa's interests included nationhood for Albania, then a mere province of the Turkish-Balkan Ottoman Empire, but aspiring to independence. He was one of the few outsiders who ventured into the mountainous areas in the north of Albania. He soon learned the Albanian dialects and customs.\n\nEventually, he had good relations with the leaders of the nationalist Albanian resistance against the Turks who occupied the region. Nopcsa gave passionate speeches and smuggled in weapons. In 1912 the Balkan states joined forces to drive out the Turks. This was successful, but the newly liberated states were immediately plunged into internal conflicts. However, out of these conflicts, Albania arose as an independent state. At an international conference aiming to clarify the status of Albania, Nopcsa was at first a contender for the throne of that country.\n\nLater, during the First World War, Nopcsa was a spy for Austria-Hungary. He also led a group of Albanian wartime volunteers. However, with the defeat of Austria-Hungary at the end of the war, Nopcsa's native Transylvania was ceded to Romania. As a consequence, the Baron of Felső-Szilvás lost his estates and other possessions. Compelled to find paid employment, he landed a job as the head of the Hungarian Geological Institute.\n\nBut Nopcsa's tenure in the Geological Institute was short-lived. He moved to Vienna with his long-standing Albanian secretary and lover Bajazid Elmaz Doda to study fossils. Yet there he ran into financial difficulties and was distracted in his work. To cover his debts, he sold his fossil collection to the Natural History Museum in London. Soon Nopcsa became depressed. Finally, in 1933, he fatally shot first his partner, Doda, and then himself. He was cremated at \"Feuerhalle Simmering\" in Vienna, and his ashes buried there (Section 3, Ring 3, Group 8, No. 44).\n\nNopcsa left behind a considerable quantity of scientific publications and private diaries. The diaries paint a picture of a complex man with great intuition, but without the ability to understand the motives of others. His devotion to the cause of the Albanians was in contrast to his sociopathic insensitivity. In his diaries he nonchalantly wrote about his bid to become king of Albania:\n\nHis previously unpublished memoir was published in German in 2001 and translated to English in 2014 as \"Traveler, Scholar, Political Adventurer: A Transylvanian Baron at the Birth of Albanian Independence\", edited by Robert Elsie.\n\nNopcsa's main contribution to paleontology – and hence \"paleobiology\" – was that he was one of the first researchers who tried to \"put flesh onto bones.\" At a time when paleontologists were mainly interested in assembling bones, he tried to deduce the physiology and living behavior of the dinosaurs he was studying. Nopcsa was the first to suggest that these archosaurs cared for their young and exhibited complex social behavior.\n\nAnother of Nopcsa's theories that was ahead of its time was that birds evolved from ground-dwelling dinosaurs, which developed feathers to run faster. This theory found favor in the 1960s and later gained wide acceptance, though later fossil finds of tree-living feathered dinosaurs suggest the development of flight may have been more complex than Nopcsa envisioned. Additionally, Nopcsa's conclusion that at least some Mesozoic era reptiles were warm-blooded is now shared by much of the scientific community.\nNopcsa studied Transylvanian dinosaurs intensively, even though they were smaller than their \"cousins\" elsewhere in the world. For example, he unearthed six-meter-long sauropods, a group of dinosaurs which elsewhere commonly grew to 30 meters or more, which he named \"Magyarosaurus\". Nopcsa deduced that the area where the remains were found was an island, Hațeg Island (now the Haţeg or Hatzeg basin in Romania) during the Mesozoic era. He theorized that \"limited resources\" found on islands commonly have an effect of \"reducing the size of animals\" over the generations, producing a localized form of dwarfism. Nopcsa's theory of insular dwarfism—also known as the island rule—is today widely accepted (highlighted by Gareth Dyke in \"The Dinosaur Baron of Transylvania\" In \"Scientific American\", October 2011, pp. 81–83). Additional pygmy sauropods, named \"Europasaurus\", were recently discovered in northern Germany (analyzed by P. Martin Sander in \"Nature\", 8 June 2006).\n\nNopcsa also created a theory about the dinosaurs' sexual dimorphism. Among others, he thought that hadrosaurid species with the cranial crests were males and those without them were females. He paired \"Kritosaurus\" with \"Parasaurolophus\", \"Prosaurolophus\" with \"Saurolophus\" and others. His examples were not proved to be true, but his opinion that sexual dimorphism was present among hadrosaurid dinosaurs has gained acceptance, see for example \"Lambeosaurus\".\n\nAs a result of the above studies and publications, Nopcsa is sometimes considered to be the \"father\" of modern paleobiology, even though he originally termed the field as \"paleophysiology.\"\n\nBut he was also an important geologist. Indeed, Nopcsa was one of the first scholars to study the geology of the western Balkans, particularly northern Albania.\n\nDuring his lifetime Nopcsa published more than fifty scientific studies concerning Albania, covering a wide range of linguistics, folklore, ethnology, history and \"kanun\" (that is, Albanian customary law). He was the leading expert on Albania in his time.\n\nAfter Nopcsa's death, several of his important manuscripts were left unpublished. He participated in the work of the Albanian Congress of Trieste, published his notes on the congress that became of particular historical interest. The Albanological part of his estate ended up in the hands of Norbert Jokl, a renowned specialist in Albanian studies. At that time, Nopcsa's material consisted of thousands of pages of notes, sketches, and finished text. Subsequently, this library came into possession of Mid'hat Bey Frashëri. When Frashëri was forced to flee the country, Nopcsa's materials were confiscated by the communist regime of Enver Hoxha.

It was founded by George and Helen Gardiner in 1984 to house their collection of ceramic art. It is located on Queen's Park just south of Bloor Street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, opposite the Royal Ontario Museum. The nearest subway station is Museum.\n\nThe Gardiner Museum was founded in 1984 by George and Helen Gardiner. It originally opened as the George R. Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art to house the couple's collection. From 1976 when they started collecting ceramics to 1981 when they decided to share their treasures with the public, George and Helen assembled several astounding specialized collections in the fields of pottery from the Ancient Americas and European ceramics that would become the core of the museum when it opened. In their depth and breadth, the Gardiner's collections of Meissen porcelain, rare Du Paquier porcelain from Vienna (the second factory to successfully produce hard-paste porcelain in Europe), and Hausmaler decorated porcelain are of world importance. The Gardiners also established one of the best collections of Italian Renaissance maiolica in Canada, and the most comprehensive collection of figures from the commedia dell'arte in a public institution.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1996, the Gardiner Museum was managed by the Royal Ontario Museum, located across the street on Queen's Park Crescent. In 1996, an endowment from George Gardiner supported the museum becoming an independent institution again. In January 2004, the Gardiner Museum closed temporarily to implement a major expansion, with funding provided primarily by the Government of Canada, the Province of Ontario, and Helen Gardiner. Building on the qualities of the original structure, designed by architect Keith Wagland, the architectural firm of Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg added exhibition galleries, larger educational, administration and studio spaces, a new retail shop, as well as a new dining and special events area. During this period, the museum temporarily relocated to a warehouse at 60 McCaul Street. The original building was designed by Keith Wagland, who was professor to Kuwabara during his time at the University of Toronto. When the Gardiner Museum re-opened in 2006, the renovation received widespread critical acclaim and is often cited as one of the most beautiful buildings in Toronto. The addition of over 14,000 square feet has allowed the museum to broaden its focus to include an expanded collections purview, more special exhibitions, and opportunities for greater public participation.\n\nAs the museum grew, ceramic collectors were attracted to what had become one of the most significant centres of ceramics in North America. For example, The Radlett Collection of 18th-century English porcelain is now an important component of the museum, and the 1760 Beer Jug with a portrait of General James Wolfe is one of the best known pieces in this collection. The Robert Murray Bell and Ann Walker Bell Collection of Chinese Blue and White Porcelain is another highlight, including a Qing dynasty Bianhu (flask). The Macdonald Collection of Japanese and Japanese-inspired porcelain, including the Kakiemon cup and saucer with the \"Lady in a Pavilion\", forms a very special aspect of the museum, illuminating the connection between the cultures of Japan and Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.\n\nThe Hans Syz Collection, donated in 1996, is a remarkable assemblage of European porcelain. The Norman and Cecily Bell Collection, donated in 1998, consists predominantly of English transfer-printed wares of unique quality. The Thomas Henry Clark Collection, donated in 1999, comprises important pieces of English and Continental tin-glazed earthenware. In 1991, Helen Armstrong bequeathed the Vernon W. Armstrong Collection of eighteenth-century porcelain. Some of the Gardiner's finest Minton pieces have been donated by Robert and Marian Cumming since 1991. In 2008, Jean and Kenneth Laundy donated a significant collection of eighteenthand nineteenth-century creamware, and in 2012 and 2013 the Gardiner received outstanding examples of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French faience from Pierre and Mariel O'Neill-Karch. Numerous other donors have given exceptional ceramic art to the museum including Aaron Milrad and Diana Reitberger. A recent transformative donation was The Raphael Yu Collection of Canadian Ceramics, made in 2011, which added 318 objects. The museum is committed to building the finest collection of Canadian ceramics in the country, as well as ensuring that vital curatorial work about these ceramics is undertaken.\n\nToday the museum boasts an expanding permanent collection, a full schedule of exhibitions and programs (including popular clay classes for adults and children), and a growing audience.\n\nIts permanent collection of over 4,000 pieces, includes works from the Ancient Americas, Italian Renaissance, English Delftware, Chinese and Japanese porcelain, European porcelain, and a contemporary gallery. In addition to the permanent collections, the museum mounts temporary special exhibitions throughout the year.\n\nThe museum offers programs, lectures, and other special events. It has several studio spaces in which clay classes for adults and children are offered.\n\nThe museum is affiliated with the Canadian Museums Association, Canadian Heritage Information Network and the Virtual Museum of Canada.\n\n\n"}

Launched by a group called The Zippies from San Francisco's 181 Club on Guy Fawkes Day, November 5, 1994, it resulted in government websites going down for at least a week. It utilised a form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) known as the Email bomb in order to overload servers as a form of online protest and Internet activism. It was the first such use of the Internet and technology as a weapon of struggle and/or civil disobedience, and preceded the .\n\nUnder the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act of 1994, the definition of music played at a rave was given as: \"music includes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats\".\n\nSections 63, 64 & 65 of the Act targeted electronic dance music played at raves. The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act empowered police to stop a rave in the open air when \"ten or more people are attending, or where two or more are making preparations for a rave\". Section 65 allowed any uniformed constable who believes a person is on their way to a rave within a radius to stop them and direct them away from the area; \"non-compliant citizens may be subject to a maximum fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale (£1000)\".\n\nThe Zippies sought to jam the mailboxes of UK politicians associated with the Bill in order to bring their attention to the issue of natural justice involving basic rights and freedoms. In effect, the collective action was saying: \"If you take away our freedom, we have the power to take away something you take for granted, and to do this in a way which deploys the Internet as a weapon\".\n\nSeveral hackers not directly associated with the group launched all-out penetration testing and load testing operations against several UK government websites, resulting in a tit-for-tat battle, as the Zippies mailbox on morph.com went down, along with the entire server of Morph, a well-known Bay Area BBS.\n\nThe event was broadcast on Radio Free Berkeley.\n\nThe protest action occurred during the manhunt for Kevin Mitnick and was thus partly an underground event. The media also refused to entertain the implications of electronic civil disobedience, with public attention focused on the problem of illegal raves and black-hat hackers, prompting scare stories about \"evil hackers\" and \"young hoodlums\" penetrating the British defences while the zippies were written off as nothing more than electrohippies.\n\nSome criticism of the Intervasion was expressed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation who complained about the \"lack of a cutoff date\". Other criticism on the Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (WELL) BBS centered on the use of militant language. The online protest action also suffered from conflict between its stated aims: \"To clog the servers of the UK government\", and its call to send email messages to UK politicians. Thus jamming mailboxes with email and large file attachments defeated the purpose of the exercise which was essentially an early form of hacktivism. The nature of the collective action was also not articulated well enough. For instance, the digital be-in which occurred during the launch of Timothy Leary's Chaos and Cyberculture, in which Leary was \"kidnapped\" without the consent of his publisher, and \"forced\" to DDoS the UK government, was simply a protest message, sent repeatedly to mail-boxes around the world.\n\n\n"}

There followed other fragments of the bust of an Iberian lady, and one large piece included the headdress, face and neck, which were found to have similarities to the Iberian bust, Lady of Elche. The sculpture had been hammered to fragments and even burnt in places. These fragments were taken to the laboratory of the Provincial Archaeological Museum of Alicante, where restorer Vincent Bernabeu began with washing and identifying the bits, first the chin, then the lips, then collar and chest pieces, and many other fragments that did not fit together and were not part of the carved surface. The delicate and painstaking task of restoration began in October 1987 and was completed in June 1988.\n\nThe restored sculpture is of fine-grained greyish limestone. The Lady is wearing a tunic with a round neckline.\nA scalloped headband crosses the brow and connects the rodetes, which represent hollow wheels, probably of thin metal, on each side. Above the headband and rodetes the Lady wears a mantle with finely carved drapery details. The necklaces the Lady wears are each different; one is composed of seven bullae which are all the same except for the central one, which is grooved. Below it is another necklace that has larger bullae, some shaped like curved triangles and some semicircular at the bottom. The string of beads worn second from the neck has olive-shaped, spherical and flat beads, above it is a string of spherical beads with two plates at the center. In real life these beads would have been made of glassy paste, as such beads often appeared in the Albufereta excavation.\n\nIn style the Lady of Guardamar is a bit more archaic than the other contemporary Iberian sculptures Lady of Baza or the Lady of Elche, with features more Iberian. As nothing from the site is more recent than 300 BCE, and the site flourished between 430 and 350 BCE, it seems likely that the Lady dates from 400 to 370 BCE. \n\n"}

{"id": "617451", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617451", "title": "Majoritarianism", "text": "Majoritarianism\n\nMajoritarianism is a traditional political philosophy or agenda that asserts that a majority (sometimes categorized by religion, language, social class, or some other identifying factor) of the population is entitled to a certain degree of primacy in society, and has the right to make decisions that affect the society. This traditional view has come under growing criticism and democracies have increasingly included constraints in what the parliamentary majority can do, in order to protect citizens' fundamental rights.\n\nThis should not be confused with the concept of a majoritarian electoral system, which is a simple electoral system that usually gives a majority of seats to the party with a plurality of votes. A parliament elected by this method may be called a majoritarian parliament (e.g., the Parliament of the United Kingdom and the Parliament of India).\n\nUnder a democratic majoritarian political structure, the majority would not exclude any minority from future participation in the democratic process. Majoritarianism is sometimes pejoratively referred to by its opponents as \"ochlocracy\" or \"tyranny of the majority\". Majoritarianism is often referred to as majority rule, which may refer to a majority class \"ruling\" over a minority class, while not referring to the decision process called \"majority rule.\n\nAdvocates of majoritarianism argue that majority decision making is intrinsically democratic and that any restriction on majority decision making is intrinsically undemocratic. If democracy is restricted by a constitution which cannot be changed by a simple majority decision then yesterday's majority is being given more weight than today's. If it is restricted by some small group, such as aristocrats, judges, priests, soldiers, or philosophers, then society becomes an oligarchy. The only restriction acceptable in a majoritarian system is that a current majority has no right to prevent a different majority emerging in the future (this could happen, for example, if a minority persuades enough of the majority to change its position). In particular, a majority cannot exclude a minority from future participation in the democratic process. Majoritarianism does not prohibit a decision being made by representatives as long as this decision is made via majority rule, as it can be altered at any time by any different majority emerging in the future.\n\nOne critique of majoritarianism is that systems without supermajority requirements for changing the rules for voting can be shown to likely be unstable. Among other critiques of majoritarianism is that most decisions in fact take place not by majority rule, but by plurality, unless the voting system artificially restricts candidates or options to two only. In turn, due to Arrow's paradox, it is not possible to have plurality voting systems with more than two options that retain adherence to both certain \"fairness\" criteria and rational decision-making criteria.\n\nMajoritarianism, as a concept of government, branches out into several forms. The classic form includes unicameralism and a unitary state.\n\nQualified majoritarianism is a more inclusionary form, with degrees of decentralization and federalism.\n\nIntegrative majoritarianism incorporates several institutions to preserve minority groups and foster moderate political parties.\n\nThere are relatively few instances of large-scale majority rule in recorded history, most notably the majoritarian system of Athenian democracy and other ancient Greek city-states. However, some argue that none of those Greek city-states were truly majority rule, particularly due to their exclusion of women, non-landowners, and slaves from decision-making processes. Most of the famous ancient philosophers staunchly opposed majoritarianism, because decisions based on the will of the uneducated and uninformed 'masses' are not necessarily wise or just. Plato is a prime example with his \"Republic\", which describes a societal model based on a tripartite class structure.\n\nAnarchist anthropologist David Graeber offers a reason as to why majority democratic government is so scarce in the historical record. \"Majority democracy, we might say, can only emerge when two factors coincide: 1. a feeling that people should have equal say in making group decisions, and 2. a coercive apparatus capable of enforcing those decisions.\" Graeber argues that those two factors almost never meet: \"Where egalitarian societies exist, it is also usually considered wrong to impose systematic coercion. Where a machinery of coercion did exist, it did not even occur to those wielding it that they were enforcing any sort of popular will.\"\n\nMajoritarianism (as a theory), similar to democracy, has often been used as a pretext by sizable or aggressive minorities to politically oppress other smaller (or civically inactive) minorities, or even sometimes a civically inactive majority (see Richard Nixon's reference to the \"Silent Majority\" that he asserted supported his policies).\n\nThis agenda is most frequently encountered in the realm of religion: In essentially all Western nations, for instance, Christmas Day—and in some countries, other important dates in the Christian calendar as well—are recognized as legal holidays; plus a particular denomination may be designated as the state religion and receive financial backing from the government (examples include the Church of England in England and the Lutheran Church in the Scandinavian countries). Virtually all countries also have one or more official languages, often to the exclusion of some minority group or groups within that country who do not speak the language or languages so designated. In most cases, those decisions have not been made using a majoritarian referendum, and even in the rare case when a referendum has been used, a new majority is not allowed to emerge at any time and repeal it.\n\nIn recent times—especially beginning in the 1960s—some forms of majoritarianism have been countered by liberal reformers in many countries: in the 1963 case \"Abington School District v. Schempp\", the United States Supreme Court declared that school-led prayer in the nation's public schools was unconstitutional, and since then many localities have sought to limit, or even prohibit, religious displays on public property. The movement toward greater consideration for the rights of minorities within a society is often referred to as pluralism.\n\nThis has provoked a backlash from some advocates of majoritarianism, who lament the Balkanization of society they claim has resulted from the gains made by the multicultural agenda; these concerns were articulated in a 1972 book, \"The Dispossessed Majority\", written by Wilmot Robertson. Multiculturalists, in turn, have accused majoritarians of racism and xenophobia.\n\n"}
{"id": "39127991", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39127991", "title": "Miscellany", "text": "Miscellany\n\nA miscellany is a collection of various pieces of writing by different authors. Meaning a mixture, medley, or assortment, a miscellany can include pieces on many subjects and in a variety of different forms. In contrast to anthologies, whose aim is to give a \"selective\" and \"canonical\" view of literature, miscellanies were produced for the entertainment of a contemporary audience and so instead emphasise \"collectiveness\" and \"popularity\". Laura Mandell and Rita Raley state:\nManuscript miscellanies are important in the Middle Ages, and are the sources for most surviving shorter medieval vernacular poetry. Medieval miscellanies often include completely different types of text, mixing poetry with legal documents, recipes, music, medical and devotional literature and other types of text, and in medieval contexts a mixture of types of text is often taken as a necessary condition for describing a manuscript as a miscellany. They may have been written as a collection, or represent manuscripts of different origins that were later bound together for convenience. In the early modern period miscellanies remained significant in a more restricted literary context, both in manuscript and printed forms, mainly as a vehicle for collections of shorter pieces of poetry, but also other works. Their numbers increased until their peak of importance in the 18th century, when over 1000 English poetry miscellanies were published, before the rise of anthologies in the early 19th century. The printed miscellany gradually morphed into the format of the regularly published magazine, and many early magazines used the word in their titles.\n\nThe broadest distinction is between manuscript and printed miscellanies. Manuscript miscellanies were carefully compiled by hand, but also circulated, consumed, and sometimes added to in this organic state – they were a prominent feature of 16th and early 17th century literary culture. Printed miscellanies, which evolved in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were compiled by editors and published by booksellers in order to make a profit. While manuscript miscellanies were produced by a small coterie of writers, and so were constructed around their own personal tastes, printed miscellanies were increasingly aimed towards a popular audience, and bear the marks of commercially driven, money making, opportunistic endeavours.\n\nMulti-authored collections are known to exist in many forms – such as newspapers, magazines, or journals – and the act of commonplacing, of transcribing useful extracts and quotations from multiple sources is also well recorded. However, the formal production of \"literary\" miscellanies came into its established form in the 16th and 17th centuries, and reached a highpoint in the 18th century. Although literary miscellanies would often contain critical essays and extracts of prose or drama, their main focus was popular verse, often including songs. At this time poetry was still a dominant literary form, for both low and high literature, and its variety and accessibility further suited it to miscellaneous publication.\n\nMost medieval miscellanies include some religious texts, and many consist of nothing else. A few examples are given here to illustrate the range of material typically found. The Theological miscellany (British Library, MS Additional 43460) was made in late 8th century Italy with 202 folios of patristic writings in Latin. The 9th-century Irish Book of Armagh is also mostly in Latin but includes some of the earliest surviving Old Irish writing, as well as several texts on Saint Patrick, significant sections of the New Testament, and a 4th-century saint's \"Life\". The Nowell Codex (BL Cotton Vitellius A. xv, ignoring a later volume bound in with it) is an Old English manuscript of about 1000 to 1010. It is famous for the only text of \"Beowulf\" but also includes a life of Saint Christopher, \"Wonders of the East\" (a description of various far-off lands and their fantastic inhabitants), a translation of a \"Letter of Alexander to Aristotle\", and the poem \"Judith\" based on the Old Testament \"Book of Judith\". It is one of the four Old English Poetic Codices from which the bulk of surviving Old English poetry comes, all of which can be classed as miscellanies.\n\nThe \"Lacnunga\" is a 10th or 11th century miscellany in Old English, Latin and Old Irish, with health-related texts taking a wide range of approaches, from herbal medicine and other medical procedures, to prayers and charms. The lavishly illuminated late 13th century North French Hebrew Miscellany contains mostly biblical and liturgical texts, but also legal material, over 200 poems, and calendars. The large 9th-century Chinese text \"Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang\", contains various Chinese and foreign legends and hearsay, reports on natural phenomena, short anecdotes, and tales of the wondrous and mundane, as well as notes on such topics as medicinal herbs and tattoos. The \"Trevelyon Miscellany of 1608\", an oversized illustrated manuscript of 594 pages, depicts a wide range of subjects including herbal cures, biblical stories, a list of the mayors of London, proverbs, calendars, and embroidery patterns.\n\nVerse miscellanies are collections of poems or poetic extracts that vary in authorship, genre, and subject matter. The earlier tradition of manuscript verse continued to be produced in the 16th century and onwards, and many of these early examples are preserved in national, state, and university libraries, as well as in private collections. The Devonshire Manuscript is a verse miscellany that was produced in the 1530s and early 1540s, and contains a range of works, from original pieces and fragments to translations and medieval verse. Compiled by three eminent women, it is one of the first examples of men and women collaborating on a literary work.\nAlso prominent is the Arundel Harington manuscript, containing the writings of Sir Thomas Wyatt, Queen Elizabeth, and Sir Philip Sidney. Into the 17th century, the two Dalhousie Manuscripts are also of literary significance, as they contain the largest sustained contemporary collection of John Donne’s verse. Although fewer medieval verse miscellanies have been preserved, the Auchinleck Manuscript survives as a good example: it was produced in London in the 1330s and offers a rare snapshot of pre-Chaucerian Middle English poetry. However, most surviving manuscript verse miscellanies are from the 17th century:\n\nPrinted verse miscellanies arose in the latter half of the 16th century, during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603). One of the most influential English Renaissance verse miscellanies was Richard Tottel’s \"Songes and Sonettes\", now better known as \"Tottel's Miscellany\". First printed in 1557, it ran into nine further editions before 1587; it was not then printed again until the 18th century. Although few new miscellanies emerged during the insurrectionary years of James I and Charles I (1603–1649), there was a resurgence of interest during the Restoration period and 18th century, and the vast majority of printed verse miscellanies originate from this latter period.\n\nThe poetry in these miscellanies varied widely in genre, form, and subject, and would frequently include: love lyrics, pastorals, odes, ballads, songs, sonnets, satires, hymns, fables, panegyrics, parodies, epistles, elegies, epitaphs, and epigrams, as well as translations into English and prologues and epilogues from plays. The practice of attributing poems in miscellanies was equally varied: sometimes editors would carefully identify authors, but most often the miscellaneous form would allow them to disregard conventions of authorship. Often authors were indicated by a set of initials, a partial name, or by reference to a previous poem \"by the same hand\"; equally often there were anonymous or pseudonymous attributions, as well as misattributions to other authors – or even made-up or deceased persons. Within a miscellany, editors and booksellers would often exercise considerable freedom in reproducing, altering, and extracting texts. Due to early copyright laws, lesser-known authors would regularly play no part in the printing process, receive no remuneration or royalties, and their works could be freely redistributed (and sometimes even pirated) once in the public domain.\n\nThroughout the 18th century, the miscellany was the customary mode through which popular verse and occasional poetry would be printed, circulated, and consumed. Michael F. Suarez, one of the leading authorities on miscellanies, states:\n\nIncluding songbooks, the \"New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature\" lists almost 5000 verse miscellanies which were printed between 1701 and 1800. Due to the sheer number and variety of miscellanies printed in the 18th century, there are few generalizations that can be made about them. From the polite (Allan Ramsay’s \"The Tea-Table Miscellany\", 1724–27) to the partly obscene (\"The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany\", 1731–33) the central purpose behind nearly all printed verse miscellanies was the reader’s entertainment. However, they were also marketed with practical purposes in mind: as educative moral guides (\"Miscellanies, Moral and Instructive, in Prose and Verse\", 1787), as repositories of useful information (\"A Miscellany of Ingenious Thoughts and Reflections in Verse and Prose\", 1721–30), as elocutionary aids (William Enfield’s \"The Speaker\", 1774-1820), and as guides for poetical composition (Edward Bysshe's \"The Art of English Poetry\", 1702–62).\n\nIn a competitive market the title of miscellanies was increasingly important. Without a specific selling-point, more generic complications would use catch-all titles as a tactic to familiarise themselves with a wide range of audiences and to appeal to a breadth of tastes. Titles could evoke the ornamental (\"The Bouquet: or Blossoms of Fancy\", 1796), the medicinal (\"The Merry Companion: or, A Cure for the Spleen\", 1730), the festive or feast (\"A Banquet of the Muses: or The Miscellany of Miscellanies\", 1746), the curious (\"A Museum for Young Gentlemen and Ladies\", 1751–82), and the curatorial (\"The Foundling Hospital for Wit\", 1743–64).\n\nDespite these categorizations, miscellanies attempted to appeal to a wide audience by containing a variety of material for different tastes. Although an editor might orient the miscellany towards an intended audience, by nature of the variety of verse a much wider readership would have been possible. One-off, occasional miscellanies might prove popular and warrant further volumes or editions, such as political pamphlets (\"Poems on Affairs of State\", 1689-1705), resort-based works (\"Tunbrigalia: or the Tunbridge Miscellany\", 1712–40), local productions (\"The Yorkshire Garland\", 1788), and courtly, coterie or collegiate collections (Thomas Warton’s \"The Oxford Sausage: or select poetical pieces written by the most celebrated wits of the University of Oxford\", 1764-80).\n\nOften the commercial success of a miscellany would stimulate the publication of similarly titled, parasitic, and even entirely pirated works. Dublin booksellers, outside the jurisdiction of the Statute of Anne (1710) which had established copyright in England, could legally reproduce any popular miscellany that they thought would make a profit. Robert Dodsley’s hugely popular \"Collection of Poems by Several Hands\" (1748) was copied entirely by Dublin booksellers in 1751, though it also underwent other, more minor piracies in the English literary market – such as unauthorized continuations, supplements, or companion texts attempting to exploit the reputation of the original.\n\nAlthough poetry maintained cultural pre-eminence for most of the 18th century, it was at the same time retreating before the advance of prose, and particularly the rise of the novel, as the new dominant form of literary expression in the West. The decline of poetry as the most widely printed format is also partly technological. Lee Erickson argues:\n\nMiscellanies however remained popular throughout the 19th century, especially what came to be known as the “weekly news miscellany, which typically appeared at the weekend and featured not only a summary of the week’s intelligence but also a variety of instructive and entertaining matter”, in other words what we call today a magazine, but poetry was no longer privileged among these publications. Verse miscellanies slowly died out in the Victorian era, as literary miscellanies made possible the serial publication of novels, such as William Harrison Ainsworth’s \"Jack Sheppard\" (1839-40) or Charles Dickens’ \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (1859) which was published in 31 weekly instalments in his literary periodical \"All the Year Round\". There were few, if any, miscellanies devoted to poetry. Instead, verse would be the minority of content, in order to provide variety from the extensive prose:\n\nIn the wake of collections such as Robert Anderson’s \"Works of the British Poets\" (thirteen vols., 1792-95) and Alexander Chalmers’ \"Works of the English Poets\" (twenty-one vols., 1810), anthologies were increasingly adopted for the publication of assorted poems. Barbara M. Benedict argues:\n\nPrinting technologies and the rise of the novel played an important role in reshaping the nature of miscellanies, as did changing ideas about the native literary canon. Attempts to construct a credible canon of English verse had been ongoing since the early 18th century, and with its success the place of poetry was determined by the advent of authoritative anthologies which claimed to represent the very best of the English poetic tradition.\n\nIn contrast to anthologies, whose aim is to give a canonical history of literature, miscellanies tend to reflect the dynamic literary culture of the time in which they were produced. As Michael F. Suarez states:\n\nThere are modifications to this definition, such as the argument that miscellanies could contain elements that might be considered anthological (the inclusion of classical literary pieces for example) or could be republished years later when their original contents had matured in literary value. Suarez also notes that eighteenth-century miscellanies often contained “extracts from a variety of single-author publications” and, furthermore, that “many miscellanies appropriated select pieces from earlier poetry collections, thus forming what were essentially anthologies of miscellanies.”\n\nIt is generally accepted that miscellanies offer insight into the popular taste of the moment, of what people read and how they read it; yet they also provide information about the aesthetic, social and economic concerns underlying the production and consumption of literature. Miscellanies were assembled, marketed and sold with a contemporary reading audience in mind, and reveal a dynamic between the taste which they played a part in shaping, and the preoccupations of the editors who complied and the publishers who sold them. Indeed, the range of price and format reveals the extent to which poetry was packaged and sold for different readerships. As Jennifer Batt argues:\n\nMiscellanies frequently placed emphasis on variety, novelty and fashionability, providing their readers with a range of different pieces by various writers, but also keeping them abreast of the newest developments in the literary market. They are a prime demonstration of early marketing and advertising techniques in literature.\n\nMiscellanies were an influential literary form at the time. From the beginning of the 18th century, verse miscellanies were gathering together a selection of poetic works by different authors, past and present, and so played a part in the development of the concept of the English canon. These literary miscellanies might be sold as unique collections, arising from the combinations of writers in a small literary circle; or their function could attempt to be more national and historical, by representing the finest works of British poets to date. The multiple editions of the Dryden-Tonson \"Miscellany Poems\" (1684-1708) and the Swift-Pope \"Miscellanies\" (1727–32), as well as \"The Muses Library\" (1737) and \"The British Muse\" (1738), were from early on attempting to construct a notion of a national literary heritage. The revival of interest in English balladry is also largely due to miscellanies, most famously Thomas Percy’s \"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry\" (1765). Miscellanies also played a part in the development of other literary forms, particularly the novel. Since so many collections included prose extracts alongside poetry, often from eighteenth-century novels such as Laurence Sterne’s \"Tristram Shandy\" (1759), it is arguable they aided the popularisation of novels. Leah Price’s \"The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel\" (2000), in particular, discusses the relationship between miscellanies and prose fiction in the latter half of the 18th century.\n\nBecause of the variety and novelty they emphasise, as well as the anonymity of authorship they could offer, miscellanies often enabled the inclusion and so expression of more submerged voices, such as those of women, and more marginal forms of writing, such as the comic, the curious, and the crude. As Dustin Griffin has noted:\n\nMany miscellanies contained exclusively the writing of women, most famously \"Poems by Eminent Ladies\" (1755) – a collection of verse by 18 women poets including Aphra Behn, Elizabeth Carter, Mary Leapor, Anne Finch, Katherine Philips, Margaret Cavendish, Mary Monck, Lady Mary Chudleigh, and Mary Barber – and recently critics have brought to light the ways in which such women made a key contribution to the miscellany culture of the 18th century. The \"Perdita Project\" provides the fullest evidence of women’s role in manuscript miscellanies in the period 1500-1700.\n\nMiscellanies also presented themselves as performing an important cultural or curatorial role, by preserving unbound sheets, fragments and ephemera which otherwise would have been lost – and thus offering a unique insight into the vibrant literary life of the 18th century. A prime example of such curiosity-shop publications is \"The fugitive miscellany: a collection of fugitive pieces in prose and verse\" (1774), which includes nonsense rhymes, epitaphs, inscriptions, poems made out of newspaper cuttings, as well as wills written in verse. Late twentieth-century criticism has drawn attention to the cultural and literary importance of these non-canonical, lesser-known and ephemeral kinds of popular verse – such as the recent discovery of a poem spuriously attributed to John Milton, “An Extempore upon a Faggot”. As the most prolific source of anonymous or pseudonymous publication, miscellanies provide insight into the unconventional history of English literature. Roger Lonsdale notes in his influential anthology, \"The New Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse\" (1984): “One of the most interesting poets [from this period] is the ubiquitous ‘Anonymous’, whose voice almost never registers in conventional literary history”. Crucially, he suggests that we would know more about “the landscape of eighteenth-century poetry” if more attention was paid to “the innumerable miscellanies by several hands”.\n\nIt is now widely accepted by literary critics that paying attention to forms of access to literature, and to the reception history of individual works and authors, is an important part of the history of literary culture. In this context, the miscellany has grown rapidly in interest in eighteenth-century studies. As Jennifer Batt states:\n\nIn light of such developments there have arisen projects attempting to make the vast number and array of verse miscellanies more accessible to modern researchers and readers, most prominently through the process of online digitization. In 2012 \"Verse Miscellanies Online\" was launched, which offers a searchable critical edition of seven printed verse miscellanies published in the 16th and early 17th centuries. While some projects focus on creating online editions of the most significant verse miscellanies, others have attempted to arrange a corpus of miscellanies produced in set periods, such as \"Scriptorium: Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts Online\" (2006-2009), a digital archive of manuscript miscellanies and commonplace books from c. 1450-1720. The largest undertaking by far has been \"The Digital Miscellanies Index\", an ongoing project funded by the Leverhulme Trust. The \"Index\" seeks to create a freely available online database of the 1000-plus verse miscellanies published in the 18th century, based on a comprehensive bibliography compiled by Michael F. Suarez, and supplied by the world’s single largest collection of miscellanies held in The Bodleian Library’s Harding Collection. Begun in 2010, this project was successfully completed in September 2013. The database is currently available in a beta version.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "151398", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151398", "title": "Philip Roth", "text": "Philip Roth\n\nPhilip Milton Roth (March 19, 1933 – May 22, 2018) was an American novelist and short-story writer.\n\nRoth's fiction, regularly set in his birthplace of Newark, New Jersey, is known for its intensely autobiographical character, for philosophically and formally blurring the distinction between reality and fiction, for its \"sensual, ingenious style\" and for its provocative explorations of American identity. \n\nRoth first gained attention with the 1959 novella \"Goodbye, Columbus\", for which he received the U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. He became one of the most awarded American writers of his generation. His books twice received the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle award, and three times the PEN/Faulkner Award. He received a Pulitzer Prize for his 1997 novel \"American Pastoral\", which featured one of his best-known characters, Nathan Zuckerman, a character in many of Roth's novels. \"The Human Stain\" (2000), another Zuckerman novel, was awarded the United Kingdom's WH Smith Literary Award for the best book of the year. In 2001, in Prague, Roth received the inaugural Franz Kafka Prize.\n\nPhilip Roth was born in Newark, New Jersey, on March 19, 1933, and grew up in its Weequahic neighborhood. He was the second child of Bess (née Finkel) and Herman Roth, an insurance broker. Roth's family was Jewish, and his parents were second-generation Americans. Roth's father's parents came from Kozlov near Lviv / Lemberg in Galicia; his mother's ancestors were from the region of Kiev. He graduated from Newark's Weequahic High School in or around 1950. As Arnold H. Lubasch wrote in the \"New York Times\" in 1969, \"It has provided the focus for the fiction of Philip Roth, the novelist who evokes his era at Weequahic High School in the highly acclaimed \"Portnoy's Complaint\"... Besides identifying Weequahic High School by name, the novel specifies such sites as the Empire Burlesque, the Weequahic Diner, the Newark Museum and Irvington Park, all local landmarks that helped shape the youth of the real Roth and the fictional Portnoy, both graduates of Weequahic class of '50.\" The \"Weequahic Yearbook\" (1950) describes Roth as \"A boy of real intelligence, combined with wit and common sense.\" He was known as a comedian during his time at school. Roth attended Rutgers University in Newark for a year, then transferred to Bucknell University in Pennsylvania, where he earned a B.A., magna cum laude in English and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He received a scholarship to attend the University of Chicago, where he earned an M.A. in English literature in 1955 and worked briefly as an instructor in the university's writing program. That same year, rather than wait to be drafted, Roth enlisted in the army, but he suffered a back injury during basic training and was given a medical discharge. He returned to Chicago in 1956 to study for a PhD in Literature but dropped out after one term. Roth taught creative writing at the University of Iowa and Princeton University. He later continued his academic career at the University of Pennsylvania, where he taught comparative literature before retiring from teaching in 1991. Between the end of his studies and the publication of his first book in 1959, Roth served two years in the United States Army and then wrote short fiction and criticism for various magazines, including movie reviews for \"The New Republic.\"\n\nRoth's work first appeared in print in the \"Chicago Review\" while he was studying, and later teaching, at the University of Chicago. His first book, \"Goodbye, Columbus\", contains the novella \"Goodbye, Columbus\" and four short stories. It won the National Book Award in 1960. He published his first full-length novel, \"Letting Go,\" in 1962. In 1967 he published \"When She Was Good\", set in the WASP Midwest in the 1940s. It is based in part on the life of Margaret Martinson Williams, whom Roth married in 1959. The publication in 1969 of his fourth and most controversial novel, \"Portnoy's Complaint\", gave Roth widespread commercial and critical success, causing his profile to rise significantly. During the 1970s Roth experimented in various modes, from the political satire \"Our Gang\" to the Kafkaesque \"The Breast\". By the end of the decade Roth had created his alter ego Nathan Zuckerman. In a series of highly self-referential novels and novellas that followed between 1979 and 1986, Zuckerman appeared as either the main character or an interlocutor. \n\n\"Sabbath's Theater\" (1995) may have Roth's most lecherous protagonist, Mickey Sabbath, a disgraced former puppeteer; it won his second National Book Award. In complete contrast, \"American Pastoral\" (1997), the first volume of his so-called second Zuckerman trilogy, focuses on the life of virtuous Newark star athlete Swede Levov, and the tragedy that befalls him when Levov's teenage daughter becomes a domestic terrorist during the late 1960s; it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. \"I Married a Communist\" (1998) focuses on the McCarthy era. \"The Human Stain\" examines identity politics in 1990s America. \"The Dying Animal\" (2001) is a short novel about eros and death that revisits literary professor David Kepesh, protagonist of two 1970s works, \"The Breast\" and \"The Professor of Desire\". In \"The Plot Against America\" (2004), Roth imagines an alternative American history in which Charles Lindbergh, aviator hero and isolationist, is elected U.S. president in 1940, and the U.S. negotiates an understanding with Hitler's Nazi Germany and embarks on its own program of anti-Semitism.\n\nRoth's novel \"Everyman\", a meditation on illness, aging, desire, and death, was published in May 2006. For \"Everyman\" Roth won his third PEN/Faulkner Award, making him the only person so honored. \"Exit Ghost\", which again features Nathan Zuckerman, was released in October 2007. It was the last Zuckerman novel. \"Indignation\", Roth's 29th book, was published on September 16, 2008. Set in 1951, during the Korean War, it follows Marcus Messner's departure from Newark to Ohio's Winesburg College, where he begins his sophomore year. In 2009, Roth's 30th book, \"The Humbling\", was published. It tells the story of the last performances of Simon Axler, a celebrated stage actor. Roth's 31st book, \"Nemesis\", was published on October 5, 2010. According to the book's notes, \"Nemesis\" is the last in a series of four \"short novels,\" after \"Everyman\", \"Indignation\" and \"The Humbling\".\nIn October 2009, during an interview with Tina Brown of \"The Daily Beast\" to promote \"The Humbling\", Roth considered the future of literature and its place in society, stating his belief that within 25 years the reading of novels will be regarded as a \"cultic\" activity:\n\nI was being optimistic about 25 years really. I think it's going to be cultic. I think always people will be reading them but it will be a small group of people. Maybe more people than now read Latin poetry, but somewhere in that range. ... To read a novel requires a certain amount of concentration, focus, devotion to the reading. If you read a novel in more than two weeks you don't read the novel really. So I think that kind of concentration and focus and attentiveness is hard to come by—it's hard to find huge numbers of people, large numbers of people, significant numbers of people, who have those qualities[.]\n\nWhen asked about the prospects for printed versus digital books, Roth was equally downbeat:\n\nThe book can't compete with the screen. It couldn't compete [in the] beginning with the movie screen. It couldn't compete with the television screen, and it can't compete with the computer screen. ... Now we have all those screens, so against all those screens a book couldn't measure up.\n\nThis was not the first time Roth had expressed pessimism about the future of the novel and its significance in recent years. Talking to the \"Observer\"s Robert McCrum in 2001, he said, \"I'm not good at finding 'encouraging' features in American culture. I doubt that aesthetic literacy has much of a future here.\" In an October 2012 interview with the French magazine \"Les Inrockuptibles\", Roth announced that he would be retiring from writing and confirmed subsequently in \"Le Monde\" that he would no longer publish fiction. In May 2014, Roth claimed in an interview with Alan Yentob for the BBC that \"this is my last appearance on television, my absolutely last appearance on any stage anywhere.\"\n\nMuch of Roth's fiction revolves around semi-autobiographical themes, while self-consciously and playfully addressing the perils of establishing connections between Roth and his fictional lives and voices. Examples of this close relationship between the author's life and his characters' include narrators and protagonists such as David Kepesh and Nathan Zuckerman as well as the character \"Philip Roth\", who appears in \"The Plot Against America\" and of whom there are two in \"Operation Shylock\". Critic Jacques Berlinerblau noted in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" that these fictional voices create a complex and tricky experience for readers, deceiving them into believing they \"know\" Roth. In Roth's fiction, the question of authorship is intertwined with the theme of the idealistic, secular Jewish son who attempts to distance himself from Jewish customs and traditions, and from what he perceives as the sometimes suffocating influence of parents, rabbis, and other community leaders. Roth's fiction has been described by critics as pervaded by \"a kind of alienation that is enlivened and exacerbated by what binds it\".\n\nRoth's first work, \"Goodbye, Columbus\", was an irreverently humorous depiction of the life of middle-class Jewish Americans, and met controversy among reviewers, who were highly polarized in their judgments; one criticized it as infused with a sense of self-loathing. In response, Roth, in his 1963 essay \"Writing About Jews\" (collected in \"Reading Myself and Others\"), maintained that he wanted to explore the conflict between the call to Jewish solidarity and his desire to be free to question the values and morals of middle-class Jewish Americans uncertain of their identities in an era of cultural assimilation and upward social mobility:\nThe cry 'Watch out for the goyim!' at times seems more the expression of an unconscious wish than of a warning: Oh that they were out there, so that we could be together here! A rumor of persecution, a taste of exile, might even bring with it the old world of feelings and habits—something to replace the new world of social accessibility and moral indifference, the world which tempts all our promiscuous instincts, and where one cannot always figure out what a Jew is that a Christian is not.\n\nIn Roth's fiction, the exploration of \"promiscuous instincts\" within the context of Jewish lives, mainly from a male viewpoint, plays an important role. In the words of critic Hermione Lee:\nPhilip Roth's fiction strains to shed the burden of Jewish traditions and proscriptions. ... The liberated Jewish consciousness, let loose into the disintegration of the American Dream, finds itself deracinated and homeless. American society and politics, by the late sixties, are a grotesque travesty of what Jewish immigrants had traveled towards: liberty, peace, security, a decent liberal democracy.\n\nWhile Roth's fiction has strong autobiographical influences, it also incorporates social commentary and political satire, most obviously in \"Our Gang\" and \"Operation Shylock\". From the 1990s on Roth's fiction often combined autobiographical elements with retrospective dramatizations of postwar American life. Roth described \"American Pastoral\" and the two following novels as a loosely connected \"American trilogy\". Each of these novels treats aspects of the postwar era against the backdrop of the nostalgically remembered Jewish-American childhood of Nathan Zuckerman, in which the experience of life on the American home front during the Second World War features prominently.\n\nIn much of Roth's fiction, the 1940s, comprising Roth's and Zuckerman's childhood, mark a high point of American idealism and social cohesion. A more satirical treatment of the patriotism and idealism of the war years is evident in Roth's comic novels, such as \"Portnoy's Complaint\" and \"Sabbath's Theater\". In \"The Plot Against America\", the alternate history of the war years dramatizes the prevalence of anti-Semitism and racism in America at the time, despite the promotion of increasingly influential anti-racist ideals during the war. In his fiction, Roth portrayed the 1940s, and the New Deal era of the 1930s that preceded it, as a heroic phase in American history. A sense of frustration with social and political developments in the United States since the 1940s is palpable in the American trilogy and \"Exit Ghost\", but had already been present in Roth's earlier works that contained political and social satire, such as \"Our Gang\" and \"The Great American Novel\". Writing about the latter, Hermione Lee points to the sense of disillusionment with \"the American Dream\" in Roth's fiction: \"The mythic words on which Roth's generation was brought up—winning, patriotism, gamesmanship—are desanctified; greed, fear, racism, and political ambition are disclosed as the motive forces behind the 'all-American ideals'.\"\n\nAlthough Roth's writings often explored the Jewish experience in America, Roth rejected being labeled a Jewish-American writer. “It’s not a question that interests me. I know exactly what it means to be Jewish and it’s really not interesting,” he told the Guardian newspaper in 2005. “I’m an American.”\n\nWhile at Chicago, Roth met the novelist Saul Bellow, as well as Margaret Martinson in 1956, who became his first wife in 1959. Their separation in 1963, and Martinson's subsequent death in a car crash in 1968, left a lasting mark on Roth's literary output. Martinson was the inspiration for female characters in several of Roth's novels, including Lucy Nelson in \"When She Was Good\" and Maureen Tarnopol in \"My Life as a Man.\" The pseudo-confessional novel \"Operation Shylock\" (1993) and other works draw on a post-operative breakdown and Roth's experience of the temporary side effects of the sedative Halcion (triazolam), prescribed post-operatively in the 1980s. \n\nRoth was an atheist who once said, \"When the whole world doesn't believe in God, it'll be a great place.\" He also said during an interview with \"The Guardian\": \"I'm exactly the opposite of religious, I'm anti-religious. I find religious people hideous. I hate the religious lies. It's all a big lie,\" and \"It's not a neurotic thing, but the miserable record of religion—I don't even want to talk about it. It's not interesting to talk about the sheep referred to as believers. When I write, I'm alone. It's filled with fear and loneliness and anxiety—and I never needed religion to save me.\"\n\nIn 1990, Roth married his longtime companion, English actress Claire Bloom, with whom he had been living since 1976. In 1994 they divorced, and in 1996 Bloom published a memoir, \",\" that depicted Roth as a misogynist and control freak. Some critics have detected parallels between Bloom and the character Eve Frame in Roth's \"I Married a Communist\" (1998).\n\nRoth died at a Manhattan hospital of congestive heart failure on May 22, 2018, at the age of 85.\n\nRoth was buried at the Bard College Cemetery in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, where in 1999 he taught a class. He had originally planned to be buried next to his parents at the Gomel Chesed Cemetery in Newark, but changed his mind about 15 years before his death, in order to be close to his friend the novelist Norman Manea. Roth expressly banned any religious rituals from his funeral service, though it was noted that only one day after his burial a pebble had been placed on top of his tombstone in accordance with Jewish tradition.\n\nAmong the admirers of Roth's work is the singer songwriter, fellow New Jersey native, and acclaimed celebrant of the state's culture, Bruce Springsteen. Roth read the musician's autobiography \"Born to Run\" and Springsteen read Roth's \"American Pastoral\", \"I Married A Communist\", and \"The Human Stain\". Springsteen said of Roth's work: \"I'll tell you, those three recent books by Philip Roth just knocked me on my ass... To be in his sixties making work that is so strong, so full of revelations about love and emotional pain, that's the way to live your artistic life. Sustain, sustain, sustain.\"\n\n(The above four books are collected as \"Zuckerman Bound\")\n\n\n\n\nTwo of Roth's works won the National Book Award for Fiction; four others were finalists. Two won National Book Critics Circle awards; again, another five were finalists. He has also won three PEN/Faulkner Awards (\"Operation Shylock,\" \"The Human Stain,\" and \"Everyman\") and a Pulitzer Prize for his 1997 novel, \"American Pastoral\". In 2001, \"The Human Stain\" was awarded the United Kingdom's WH Smith Literary Award for the best book of the year. In 2002, he was awarded the National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.\nLiterary critic Harold Bloom has named him as one of the four major American novelists still at work, along with Thomas Pynchon, Don DeLillo, and Cormac McCarthy. His 2004 novel \"The Plot Against America\" won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 2005 as well as the Society of American Historians’ James Fenimore Cooper Prize. Roth was also awarded the United Kingdom's WH Smith Literary Award for the best book of the year, an award Roth has received twice. He was honored in his hometown in October 2005 when then-mayor Sharpe James presided over the unveiling of a street sign in Roth's name on the corner of Summit and Keer Avenues where Roth lived for much of his childhood, a setting prominent in \"The Plot Against America\". A plaque on the house where the Roths lived was also unveiled. In May 2006, he was given the PEN/Nabokov Award, and in 2007 he was awarded the PEN/Faulkner award for \"Everyman,\" making him the award's only three-time winner. In April 2007, he was chosen as the recipient of the first PEN/Saul Bellow Award for Achievement in American Fiction.\n\nThe May 21, 2006 issue of \"The New York Times Book Review\" announced the results of a letter that was sent to what the publication described as \"a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages, asking them to please identify 'the single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years.'\" Six of Roth's novels were among the 22 selected: \"American Pastoral,\" \"The Counterlife,\" \"Operation Shylock,\" \"Sabbath's Theater,\" \"The Human Stain,\" and \"The Plot Against America.\" The accompanying essay, written by critic A.O. Scott, stated, \"If we had asked for the single best writer of fiction of the past 25 years, [Roth] would have won.\" In 2009, he was awarded the \"Welt\"-Literaturpreis of the German newspaper \"Die Welt\".\n\nRoth was awarded the 42nd Edward MacDowell Medal by the MacDowell Colony in 2001.\n\nRoth was awarded the 2010 National Humanities Medal by U.S. President Barack Obama in the East Room of the White House on March 2, 2011.\n\nIn May 2011, Roth was awarded the Man Booker International Prize for lifetime achievement in fiction on the world stage, the fourth winner of the biennial prize. One of the judges, Carmen Callil, a publisher of the feminist Virago house, withdrew in protest, referring to Roth's work as \"Emperor's clothes\". She said \"he goes on and on and on about the same subject in almost every single book. It's as though he's sitting on your face and you can't breathe ... I don’t rate him as a writer at all ...\". Observers quickly noted that Callil had a conflict of interest, having published a book by Claire Bloom (Roth's ex-wife) that criticized Roth and lambasted their marriage. In response, one of the two other Booker judges, Rick Gekoski, remarked:\nIn 1959 he writes \"Goodbye, Columbus\" and it's a masterpiece, magnificent. Fifty-one years later he's 78 years old and he writes \"Nemesis\" and it is so wonderful, such a terrific novel ... Tell me one other writer who 50 years apart writes masterpieces ... If you look at the trajectory of the average novel writer, there is a learning period, then a period of high achievement, then the talent runs out and in middle age they start slowly to decline. People say why aren't Martin [Amis] and Julian [Barnes] getting on the Booker prize shortlist, but that's what happens in middle age. Philip Roth, though, gets better and better in middle age. In the 1990s he was almost incapable of not writing a masterpiece—\"The Human Stain\", \"The Plot Against America\", \"I Married a Communist\". He was 65–70 years old, what the hell's he doing writing that well? In 2012 he received the Prince of Asturias Award for literature. On March 19, 2013, Roth's 80th birthday was celebrated in public ceremonies at the Newark Museum.\n\nEight of Philip Roth's novels and short stories have been adapted as films: \"Goodbye, Columbus\"; \"Portnoy's Complaint\"; \"The Human Stain\"; \"The Dying Animal,\" adapted as \"Elegy\"; \"The Humbling\"; \"Indignation\"; and \"American Pastoral\". In addition, \"The Ghost Writer\" was adapted for television in 1984. In 2014, filmmaker Alex Ross Perry made \"Listen Up Philip\", which was influenced by Roth's art.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "726909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=726909", "title": "Problem play", "text": "Problem play\n\nThe problem play is a form of drama that emerged during the 19th century as part of the wider movement of realism in the arts, especially following the innovations of Henrik Ibsen. It deals with contentious social issues through debates between the characters on stage, who typically represent conflicting points of view within a realistic social context. Critic Chris Baldick writes that the genre emerged \"from the ferment of the 1890s... for the most part inspired by the example of Ibsen's realistic stage representations of serious familial and social conflicts.\" He summarises it as follows:\n\nThe critic F. S. Boas adapted the term to characterise certain plays by William Shakespeare that he considered to have characteristics similar to Ibsen's 19th-century problem plays. As a result, the term is also used more broadly and retrospectively to describe any tragicomic dramas that do not fit easily into the classical generic distinction between comedy and tragedy.\n\nWhile plays in ancient Greece and ancient Rome, mystery plays, and Elizabethan plays are clearly classified as tragedy, comedy, and satyr plays, there are some plays that exhibit the characteristics of problem plays, such as Alcestis.\n\nF. S. Boas used the term to refer to a group of Shakespeare's play, which seem to contain both comic and tragic elements. For Boas the 'problem' plays were \"Measure for Measure\", \"All's Well That Ends Well\" and \"Troilus and Cressida\". He wrote that \"throughout these plays we move along dim untrodden paths, and at the close our feeling is neither of simple joy nor pain; we are excited, fascinated, perplexed, for the issues raised preclude a completely satisfactory outcome\". Later critics have used the term for other plays, including \"Timon of Athens\" and \"The Merchant of Venice\".\n\nWhile social debates in drama were nothing new, the problem play of the 19th century was distinguished by its intent to confront the spectator with the dilemmas experienced by the characters. The earliest forms of the problem play are to be found in the work of French writers such as Alexandre Dumas, fils, who dealt with the subject of prostitution in \"The Lady of the Camellias\" (1852). Other French playwrights followed suit with dramas about a range of social issues, sometimes approaching the subject in a moralistic, sometimes in a sentimental manner. Critic Thomas H. Dickinson, writing in 1927, argued that these early problem plays were hampered by the dramatic conventions of the day, \"No play written in the problem form was significant beyond the value of the idea that was its underlying motive for existence. No problem play had achieved absolute beauty, or a living contribution to truth.\"\n\nThe most important exponent of the problem play, however, was the Norwegian writer Henrik Ibsen, whose work combined penetrating characterisation with emphasis on topical social issues, usually concentrated on the moral dilemmas of a central character. In a series of plays Ibsen addressed a range of problems, most notably the restriction of women's lives in \"A Doll's House\" (1879), sexually-transmitted disease in \"Ghosts\" (1882) and provincial greed in \"An Enemy of the People\" (1882). Ibsen's dramas proved immensely influential, spawning variants of the problem play in works by George Bernard Shaw and other later dramatists.\n\nThe genre was especially influential in the early 20th century. In Britain plays such as Houghton's \"Hindle Wakes\" (1912), developed the genre to shift the nature of the 'problem'. This \"resolutely realistic problem play set in domestic interiors of the mill town Hindle\" starts with the 'problem' of an apparently seduced woman, but ends with the woman herself rejected her status as a victim of seduction \"the 'problem' is not, after all, the redemption of a betrayed maiden's tarnished honour, but the readiness of her respectable elders to determine a young woman's future for her without regard to her rights—including here her right to erotic holiday enjoyment.\"\n\nIn America the problem play was associated with the emergence of debates over civil rights issues. Racial issues were tackled in plays such as Angelina Weld Grimké's, \"Rachel\". It was a tool of the socialist theatre in the 1920s and 30s, and overlapped with forms of documentary theatre in works such as Carl Crede's \"Paragraph 218\" (1930), which concerns the issue of abortion, and which was directed by Erwin Piscator.\n\n"}

In its most basic form, it states that once a landlord has consented to an assignment of a tenant's interest in a leasehold estate, he implicitly consents to all future assignments by the tenant.\n\nThis rule is still operative in some U.S. states and some other jurisdictions which follow English common law, but the parties may contract around the rule by putting a clause in the lease agreement which allows the landlord to reserve his right to approve or disapprove an assignment.\n\n"}
{"id": "28687842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28687842", "title": "Salme ships", "text": "Salme ships\n\nThe Salme ships are two clinker-built ships of Scandinavian origin discovered in 2008 and 2010 near Salme village on the island of Saaremaa, Estonia. Both ships were used for ship burials here around AD 700-750 in the Nordic Iron Age and contained the remains of more than 40 warriors killed in battle, as well as numerous weapons and other artifacts.\n\nThe first ship was discovered in 2008 during earth removal for infrastructure construction. An archaeological expedition has been working on site since 2008. The second ship was discovered in 2010. It is possible that at least one more ship is yet to be discovered during future excavations.\n\nThe ships were located near the ancient coastline, about above water level. The location is from the present coastline and above present water level.\n\nBoth Salme ships are clinker-built and archaeologists have estimated their time of construction to be AD 650-700 in Scandinavia. There are signs indicating they had been repaired and patched for decades, before making their final voyage. One of the ships is long and wide, the second one more than long and wide. None of them had mast or sails, and they would have been rowed for short distances along the Baltic coast, or between islands, or straight across the Baltic, as rowing longer distances has proved perfectly feasible time and again in modern times. This is also indicated by the Old Norse word for distance across water \"vikusjö, vikja\" the distance to row before changing rowers, a distance of about .\n\nSkeletal remains from at least 42 individuals were discovered in the two ships. Most of them belonged to 30–40 years old males who had been killed in battle. Analysis of some of the teeth, combined with the design of the buried artifacts, suggest that the men came from central Sweden. The smaller ship contained the skeletal remains of 7 individuals. There were at least 36 individuals buried in four layers in the large ship.\n\nFragments of more than 40 swords of various types, remains of shields, spearheads and dozens of arrowheads were found in the burial. Most of them had been deliberately deformed, perhaps to discourage grave robbery.\n\nSmaller objects included one small socketed axe, knives, whetstones, a bone comb with ornaments, a bear-claw necklace, and hundreds of gaming pieces made of whale bone and antler with six dice.\n\nThe skeletal remains of two ritually sacrificed dogs as well as hawks used for falconry were found in the burial.\n\nAccording to an early interpretation offered by Jüri Peets, the lead archaeologist at the site, the ships and the dead are of Scandinavian origin. According to the most likely scenario, a war party of Scandinavians attempted to carry out a raid against the Oeselians (Estonian inhabitants of the island of Saaremaa), but were attacked by Oeselian ships. The sides of the two ships contain numerous embedded arrowheads, some of which are of the three-pointed type used to carry burning materials to set enemy ships aflame. After losing too many oarsmen to the Estonian archers, the raiders pulled their ships aground and tried to defend themselves behind them. It appears that after the battle, the Oeselians allowed either the survivors or some other group of Scandinavians to ritually bury their dead. The burial is unusual because the ships were not covered with earth mounds. The site was eventually forgotten by the local inhabitants after it had become overblown by sand and covered with vegetation. The raid-hypothesis has led to a questioning of when the Viking Age began exactly. The Salme event took place 50-100 years earlier than the infamous Lindisfarne Viking raid in England in the summer of AD 793.\n\nThe original interpretation was called into question after the second, larger, ship was uncovered in 2010. It is likely that the human remains in it belonged to individuals of noble birth, as evidenced by the large number of expensive bronze sword-hilts and the complete lack of weaponry associated with commoners. The presence of dogs and hawks used for falconry indicates that the original purpose of the trip to Estonia may have been leisure or diplomacy. Peets suggests that the men may have come on a voyage from Sweden to forge an alliance or establish kinship ties when unknown parties set upon them.\n\nSnorri Sturluson relates in his \"Ynglinga saga\" that the Swedish king Ingvar, Östen's son, was a great warrior who often spent time patrolling the shores of his kingdom fighting Danes and Vikings from Estonia (\"Víkingr frá Esthland\"). King Ingvar finally came to a peace agreement with the Danes and could take care of the Vikings in Estonia. He consequently started pillaging in Estonia in retribution, and one summer he arrived at a place called Stein (see also Sveigder). The Vikings in Estonia (\"sýslu kind\") assembled a great army in the interior and attacked King Ingvar in a great battle. Their forces were too powerful and Ingvar fell and the Swedish forces retreated. Ingvar was buried in a mound at a place called \"Stone\" or \"Hill fort\" (\"at Steini\") on the shores of \"Aðalsýsla\", that is what is now mainland Estonia.\n\n"}

San Gervasio's pre-Hispanic name was Tantun Cuzamil, Mayan for \"Flat Rock in the place of the Swallows.\" The ruins were once a hub of worship of the goddess Ix Chel, an aged deity of childbirth, fertility, medicine, and weaving. Pre-Columbian Maya women would try to travel to San Gervasio and make offerings at least once in their lives. In 1560, the Spanish historian, Diego Lopez de Cogolludo, wrote: \"The pilgrims arrive at Cozumel for the fulfillment of their vows to offer their sacrifices, to ask help for their needs, and for the mistaken adoration of their false gods.\" The bishop of Yucatán, Diego de Landa, wrote in 1549 that the Maya \"held Cozumel in the same veneration as we have for pilgrimages to Jerusalem and Rome, and so they used to go to visit and offer presents there, as we do to holy places; and if they did not go themselves, they always sent their offerings.\"\n\nAlthough most of the stone structures at San Gervasio now lack their roofs and upper portions of their walls, archaeologists from Harvard and the University of Arizona compiled detailed plans of the remains in the early 1970s that allowed them to create reconstructed views of these buildings. Renderings of these reconstructions are illustrated in the guidebook offered for sale by the Cozumel Parks and Museum Foundation (FPMCQROO), an agency of the Mexican State of Quintana Roo and the agency responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the State park that surrounds the National Monument of the ruins of San Gervasio, which is administered separately by the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH). More information about the archaeological park, including hours of operation, entrance fees, and directions are available on the FPMCQROO website CozumelParks.com\n\nThe park is a wildlife refuge and the local iguana population has become quite habituated to humans. Although other species of lizards abound, they are not so trusting. Likewise, the peccaries and coatis that are sometimes spotted as they pass through the ruins tend to keep a safe distance from the tourists.\n\nThe ruins cover 4 districts spread out over several square kilometers, but only certain parts of District 1 are open to the public. Most of the District 1 buildings that are accessible lie within or very near the District 1 Central Plaza Group.\n\nThe first European to visit San Gervasio was Juan de Grijalva, who discovered the island for the Spanish in 1518. The second group of European visitors came with the Hernan Cortes expedition, which stopped by the island on the way to Veracruz in 1519. Both groups were received well by the Maya of Cozumel, and Cortez even wrote a letter for them to present to any Spaniards that came to the island in the future, stating that “there is no gold here and these are peaceful people.” The letter did not help much, however, when the Panfilo de Narvaez expedition arrived in 1520. Several of the expedition’s crewmembers were sick with smallpox. The sickness ran rampant across the island. There have been three mass graves discovered at San Gervasio where these smallpox victims were buried, along with their glass trade-beads given to them by the Spanish.\n\nMeaning: Little Hands\n\nConstructed during: Terminal-Classic (1000-1200 AD)\n\nLocation: East of the District 1 Central Plaza\n\nLas Manitas was the residence of the \"halach unik,\" or the Mayan ruler of Cozumel during the Terminal Classic Period. It has an outer room that was his residence and an inner sanctum that was his personal shrine. The name of the building comes from red-colored hand prints on the interior walls.\n\nMeaning: Small House\n\nConstructed during: Post Classic\n\nLocation: to the East of Las Manitas\n\nThis building was an oratorio, or chapel, used by the family of the halach uinik who lived in the nearby residence of Las Manitas (see above). It consisted of a large outer room with a small inner sanctum containing an altar. In the nearby altar platform (named La Tumba) to the west of Las Manitas, a single vaulted-roofed tomb was discovered in 1973, the only one of its kind found in San Gervasio.\n\nMeaning: Tall House\n\nConstructed during: Post-Classic (1200-1650 AD)\n\nLocation: West of the District 1 Central Plaza\n\nThis pyramid is the largest single structure in San Gervasio. Due to certain architectural arrangements in the interior of the small room on the top, this structure may have been the temple of Ixchel described in 1552 by Francisco Lopez de Gomara, when he wrote of a temple \"where they kept a very strange idol, very distinct from the others. The body of this great idol was hollow, made of baked clay and fastened to the wall with mortar, in back of which was something like a sacristy, where the priests had a small secret door cut into the side of the idol, into which one of them would enter, and from it speak to and answer those who came to worship and beg favors. With this trickery, simple men were made to believe whatever the god told them.\" In 1618, Diego Lopez de Cogolludo wrote that \"they venerated the statue more than the others, sacrificing to it birds, dogs, their own blood, and even men.\"\n\nMeaning: The Arch\n\nConstructed during: A reconstruction erected in the 1980s\n\nLocation: Northeast of District 1 Central Plaza\n\nThis arch is the main entrance from the north and west to San Gervasio’s District 1 Central Plaza Group. It is a simple arch about seven feet tall that straddles the main religious pathway (called a \"sacbe\" in Mayan, a word meaning \"white road\") running northeast from the plaza. It was reconstructed by INAH in the form of similar arches found at other sites on the east coast of Quintana Roo, such as El Cedral, located on the southern portion of Cozumel.\n\nTo the north of this arch, on the western edge of the religious pathway lies a small hole in the bedrock, similar to others that can be found throughout the ruins. These natural karst formations are called cenotes (from the Mayan word ‘’d'zonot’’) and served as water sources for the inhabitants of San Gervasio.\n\nMeaning:\n\nConstructed during: Post-Classic (1200-1650 AD)\n\nLocation: Northwest of the entrance to the ruins\n\nThe Plaza Group consists of 6 buildings arranged in a square around a central altar platform. Several of these buildings once had roofs made of timber and thatch, which have since rotted away.

Ron Hubbard and is now practiced in many other countries.\n\nHubbard characterized Scientology as a religion, and in 1953 incorporated the first Church of Scientology in New Jersey.\n\nIn 2007 a Church official claimed 3.5 million members in the United States but, according to a 2001 survey published by the City University of New York, 55,000 people in the United States would, if asked to identify their religion, have stated Scientology.\n\nTom Cruise is the most well known Scientologist in the US as well as other countries. The Church of Scientology has an emphasis on recruiting celebrities as L. Ron Hubbard himself wished, and offices designed for this use are called \"Celebrity Centres\".\n\nAfter being recognized as a tax-exempt religious organization in 1957, Scientology's tax-exempt status was lost in a 1967 IRS audit. As part of the effort to regain tax exemption during the late 1970s, Scientologists repeatedly infiltrated the IRS, copying large numbers of documents and at one point placing an electronic bugging device in an IRS conference room. These actions took place within a program code-named \"Operation Snow White\" (see below). Eleven high-ranking Scientologists, including Hubbard's wife Mary Sue Hubbard, were sentenced to time in prison for acts surrounding this operation. Hubbard himself was named as an unindicted co-conspirator as investigators could not link him to the crimes.\n\nThe Church then embarked on an aggressive, but more legal course, the church's hundreds of affiliated entities filing a steady stream of lawsuits against the IRS in an attempt to have their tax-exempt status approved. In addition, members of the Church started filing thousands of lawsuits against the IRS, claiming that they were entitled to tax deductions for auditing and training expenses.\n\nThey were finally rewarded in October 1993, when the IRS formally announced that the Church of Scientology and its related social betterment organizations had been granted tax exemption again. Since then, the U.S. Department of State has formally criticized several European countries, including Germany and France, for religious discrimination against Scientologists. In March 1997, the \"New York Times\" published an article chronicling \"Scientology's puzzling journey from tax rebel to tax exempt\" in the United States.\n\n\nIn a 1995 lawsuit against the \"Washington Post\" newspaper \"et al.\". The Religious Technology Center (RTC), the corporation that controls L. Ron Hubbard's copyrighted materials, sued to prevent a \"Post\" reporter from describing church teachings at the center of another lawsuit, claiming copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and that the circulation of their \"advanced technology\" teachings would cause \"devastating, cataclysmic spiritual harm\" to those not prepared.\n\nOperation Snow White was the Church of Scientology's name for a project during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder L. Ron Hubbard. This project included a series of infiltrations and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, and private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members, in more than 30 countries; the single largest infiltration of the United States government in history with up to 5,000 covert agents. This was also the operation that exposed 'Operation Freakout', because this was the case that brought the government into investigation on the Church.\n\nUnder this program, Scientology operatives committed infiltration, wiretapping, and theft of documents in government offices, most notably those of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. Eleven highly placed Church executives, including Mary Sue Hubbard (wife of founder L. Ron Hubbard and second-in-command of the organisation), pleaded guilty or were convicted in federal court of obstructing justice, burglary of government offices, and theft of documents and government property. The case was \"United States vs. Mary Sue Hubbard et al.\", 493 F. Supp. 209 (D.D.C. 1979).\n\nThe most widely publicized death of one of the organization's members involved the 1995 death of 36-year-old Lisa McPherson, while in the care of Scientologists at the Scientology-owned Fort Harrison Hotel, in Clearwater, Florida. Despite McPherson's having experienced symptoms usually associated with mental illness (such as removing all of her clothes at the scene of a minor traffic accident), the Church intervened to prevent McPherson from receiving psychiatric treatment, and to return her to the custody of the Church of Scientology. Records show that she was then placed in isolation as part of a Scientology program known as the Introspection Rundown. Weeks later, she was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital. Her body was covered in cockroach bites. A later autopsy showed that she had died of a pulmonary embolism.\n\nNoah Lottick was an American student of Russian studies who committed suicide on May 11, 1990 by jumping from a 10th-floor hotel window, clutching his only remaining money in his hands. After his death, a controversy arose revolving around his parents' concern over his membership in the Church of Scientology.\n\n"}

variety used by a population for public purposes, or a variety that has undergone standardization.\nTypically, varieties that become standardized are the local dialects spoken in the centers of commerce and government, where a need arises for a variety that will serve more than local needs.\nStandardization typically involves a fixed orthography, codification in authoritative grammars and dictionaries and public acceptance of these standards.\nA standard written language is sometimes termed by the German word \"Schriftsprache\".\n\nA pluricentric language has multiple interacting standard varieties.\nExamples include English, French, Portuguese, German, Korean, Serbo-Croatian, Spanish, Swedish, Armenian and Chinese.\nMonocentric languages, such as Russian and Japanese, have only one standardized version.\n\nA standard variety is developed from a group of related varieties.\nThis may be done by elevating a single variety, such as the local variety of a center of government or culture.\nAlternatively, a new variety may be defined as a selection of features from existing varieties.\nA fixed orthography is typically created for writing the variety.\nIt may be codified in normative dictionaries and grammars, or by an agreed collection of exemplary texts.\nWhether these dictionaries and grammars are created by private individuals (like \"Webster's Dictionary\") or by state institutions, they become standard if they are treated as authorities for correcting language.\nA fixed written form and subsequent codification make the standard variety more stable than purely spoken varieties, and provide a base for further development or \"ausbau\".\nThis variety becomes the norm for writing, is used in broadcasting and for official purposes, and is the form taught to non-native learners.\n\nThrough this process, the standard variety acquires prestige and a greater functional importance than local varieties.\nThose varieties are said to be dependent on, or heteronomous with respect to, the standard variety, because speakers read and write the standard, refer to it as an authority is such matters as specialist vocabulary, and any standardizing changes in their speech are towards that standard.\nIn some cases, such as Standard English, this process may take place over an extended period without government intervention.\nIn others it may be deliberately directed by official institutions, such as the Académie française or Real Academia Española, and can proceed much more quickly.\n\nLanguage standardization is often linked to the formation, or attempted formation, of nation states, as language is seen as the vehicle of a shared culture.\nDifferent national standards derived from a dialect continuum may be regarded as different languages, even if they are mutually intelligible.\nThe Scandinavian languages, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish, are often cited as examples.\n\nIn other cases governments or neighbouring populations may seek to deny a standard independent status.\nIn response, developers of a standard may base it on more divergent varieties.\nThus after Norway became independent at the start of the 20th century, the Bokmål standard based on the speech of Oslo was felt to be too similar to Danish by Ivar Aasen, who developed a rival Nynorsk standard based on western varieties.\nSimilarly, when a standard was developed in the Yugoslav republic of Macedonia from local varieties within a continuum with Serbia to the north and Bulgaria to the east, it was deliberately based on varieties from the west of the republic that were most different from standard Bulgarian.\nNow known as Macedonian, it is the national standard of the independent Republic of Macedonia, but viewed by Bulgarians as a dialect of Bulgarian.\n\nChinese consists of hundreds of local varieties, many of which are not mutually intelligible, usually classified into seven to ten major groups, including Mandarin, Wu, Yue, Hakka and Min.\nBefore the 20th century, most Chinese spoke only their local variety.\nFor two millennia, formal writing had been done in Literary Chinese (or Classical Chinese), a style modelled on the classics and far removed from any contemporary speech.\nAs a practical measure, officials of the late imperial dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a common language based on Mandarin varieties, known as \"Guānhuà\" (literally \"speech of officials\").\n\nIn the early 20th century, many Chinese intellectuals argued that the country needed a standardized language.\nBy the 1920s, Literary Chinese had been replaced as the written standard by written vernacular Chinese, which was based on Mandarin dialects.\nIn the 1930s, Standard Chinese was adopted, with its pronunciation based on the Beijing dialect, but with vocabulary also drawn from other Mandarin varieties and its syntax based on the written vernacular.\nIt is the official spoken language of the People's Republic of China (where it is called \"Pǔtōnghuà\" \"common speech\") and of the Republic of China governing Taiwan (as \"Guóyǔ\" \"national language\"), and one of the official languages of Singapore (as \"Huáyǔ\" \"Chinese language\").\nStandard Chinese now dominates public life, and is much more widely studied than any other variety of Chinese.\n\nDutch is a monocentric language, with all speakers using the same standard form (authorized by the Dutch Language Union) based on a Dutch orthography employing the Latin alphabet when writing. A process of standardisation of Dutch started in the Middle Ages, especially under the influence of the Burgundian Ducal Court in Dijon (Brussels after 1477). Till then every region spoke a different Middle Dutch dialect. The dialects of the County of Flanders and the Duchy of Brabant were the most influential around this time. The process of standardisation became much stronger at the start of the 16th century, mainly based on the urban dialect of Antwerp. In 1585 Antwerp fell to the Spanish army: many from the Southern Netherlands fled to the Northern Netherlands (that declared itself independent from Spain), especially to the province of Holland, where they influenced the urban dialects. In 1637, a further important step was made towards a unified language, when the Statenvertaling, the first major Bible translation into Dutch, was created that people from all over the new republic could understand. It used elements from various dialects but was predominantly based on the urban dialects of Holland of post 16th century.\n\nIn British English the standard, known as Standard English (SE), is historically based on the language of the medieval English court of Chancery. The late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries saw the establishment of this standard as the norm of \"polite\" society, that is to say of the upper classes. The spoken standard has come to be seen as a mark of good education and social prestige. Although often associated with the RP accent, SE can be spoken with any accent, such as General American, General Australian, etc.\n\nThe standard form of Modern Greek is based on the Southern dialects; these dialects are spoken mainly in the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, Attica, Crete and the Cyclades.\n\nTwo standardised registers of the Hindustani language have legal status India: Standard Hindi (one of 23 co-official national languages) and Urdu (Pakistan’s official tongue), resultantly, Hindustani often called “Hindi-Urdu\".\n\n\"An Caighdeán Oifigiúil\" (\"The Official Standard\"), often shortened to \"An Caighdeán\", is official standard of the Irish language. It is taught in most schools in Ireland, though with strong influences from local dialects. It was first published by the translators in Dáil Éireann in the 1950s. As of September 2013, the first major revision of the Caighdeán Oifigiúil is available, both online and in print. Among the changes to be found in the revised version are, for example, various attempts to bring the recommendations of the Caighdeán closer to the spoken dialect of Gaeltacht speakers, including allowing further use of the nominative case where the genitive would historically have been found.\n\nStandard Italian is derived from the Tuscan dialect, specifically from its Florentine variety — the Florentine influence upon early Italian literature established that dialect as base for the standard language of Italy. In particular, Italian became the language of culture for all the people of Italy, thanks to the prestige of the masterpieces of Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccolò Machiavelli, and Francesco Guicciardini. It would later become the official language of all the Italian states, and after the Italian unification it became the national language of the Kingdom of Italy. Modern Standard Italian's lexicon has been deeply influenced by almost all regional languages of Italy while its received pronunciation (known as \"Pronuncia Fiorentina Emendata\", Amended Florentine Pronunciation) is based on the accent of Romanesco (Roman dialect); these are the reasons why Standard Italian differs significantly from the Tuscan dialect.\n\nClassical Latin was the literary standard dialect of Latin spoken by higher socioeconomic classes, as opposed to the Vulgar Latin which is the generic term of the colloquial sociolects of Latin spoken across the Roman Empire by uneducated and less-educated classes. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to Gaul, Iberia, or Dacia was not identical to the Latin of Cicero, and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.\n\nIn Brazil, actors and journalists usually adopt an unofficial, but de facto, spoken standard Portuguese, originally derived from the middle-class dialect of Rio de Janeiro, but that now encompasses educated urban pronunciations from the different speech communities in the southeast. In that standard, represents the phoneme when it appears at the end of a syllable (whereas in Rio de Janeiro this represents ) the rhotic consonant spelled is pronounced in the same situation (whereas in São Paulo this is usually an alveolar flap or trill). European and African dialects have differing realizations of than Brazilian dialects, with the former using and and the latter using , , or .\n\nFour standard variants of the pluricentric Serbo-Croatian are spoken in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia. They all have the same dialect basis (Štokavian). These variants do differ slightly, as is the case with other pluricentric languages, but not to a degree that would justify considering them as different languages. The differences between the variants do not hinder mutual intelligibility and do not undermine the integrity of the system as a whole. Compared to the differences between the variants of English, German, French, Spanish, or Portuguese, the distinctions between the variants of Serbo-Croatian are less significant. Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Montenegro in their constitution have all named the language differently.\n\nIn Somalia, Northern Somali (or North-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali, particularly the Mudug dialect of the northern Darod clan. Northern Central Somali has frequently been used by famous Somali poets as well as the political elite, and thus has the most prestige among other Somali dialects.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "28706833", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28706833", "title": "Texan English", "text": "Texan English\n\nTexan English is the array of American English spoken in Texas, primarily falling under the regional dialects of Southern and Midland U.S. English. As one extensive study states, at the most basic level, the typical Texan accent is a \"Southern accent with a twist.\" The \"twist\" refers to major features of the Lower and Upper South coming into contact with one another, as well as some notable influences derived from an early Spanish-speaking population and German immigrants. In fact, there is no single accent that covers all of Texas and few dialect features are unique only to Texas. The most advanced (i.e., newest and most developed) accent features of the regional Southern U.S. dialect are reported in North and West Texas (but not El Paso), associated with the Upper South, while elements of the same regional dialect are present but less consistent in East and South Texas, associated more with the Lower South. In South Texas, particularly, Mexican Spanish characteristics are heavily influential as well. Abilene, Austin, Corpus Christi appear to align to the Midland regional accent of the United States more than the Southern regional one; El Paso aligns to the Western regional accent; and Dallas is greatly variable.\n\nEnglish in Texas is not universal in every region of the state, and its dialect boundaries, in general, are rather vague; however, most of its dialects are classifiable under the larger Midland and Southern regional dialects of the United States. Scholar Bagby Atwood stated \"I will not draw lines showing the limits of Southwestern [English] or any of its subareas. Far too many lines have been drawn already, probably by popular demand and certainly on insufficient evidence, purporting to show the limits of speech areas in the West\". Nevertheless, since 1935 and into the twentieth century, various linguists attempted to delimit Texas into dialect regions, although the evidence for their division was insufficient.\n\nThe largest group of those researchers divides Texan English into two regional varieties though with each researcher suggesting different boundaries than the others. Some linguists draw their boundaries based upon phonological (sound) differences and others on lexical (word) differences, and research data can sometimes be conjectural. Some linguists often regard East and South Texas as a particular dialect region, disagreeing on its western extension. Another set of linguists divide \"Texas linguistically in a more general East–West fashion\". According to Craig Carver, Texas can be delimited into two dialect regions: \"a south Texas layer that runs by-and-large along the Texas–Mexico border and reaches up to San Antonio, and a central Texas region that includes the areas where large numbers of speakers of German and other European languages settled\" (Carver in Walters).\n\nFrederic Cassidy divides Texas into a border that \"runs between Texarkana and Longview in East Texas and extends westward to the region south of Dallas and Fort Worth before curving southward clearly to the west of Waco, Austin, and San Antonio, putting all of the Lower Rio Grande Valley in the eastern zone\" (Cassidy 1982:202 in Underwood, 106). In contrast, Terry Jordan’s \"line turns south between Longview and Tyler, snakes its way southeast of Bryan–College Station, curves westward through Gonzales County to the east of San Antonio, and turns back in a southeastern direction to Lavaca Bay just east of Victoria\" (Jordan 1984:97, in Underwood, 106).\n\nAs Anglo-American settlers dominated central Texas, the influence of the German language in central Texas is proportionally less important than the influence of the Spanish language in south Texas. The South Texas Layer lies south of the San Antonio River and is distinguished by a large number of Spanish loanwords. The Central Texas Layer is characterized by German features, due to the large numbers of settlers. The Texan word \"clook\" (= a setting hen), which derived from the German word \"Glucke\", is pronounced with the original German high back vowel /ʊ/, whereas in other regions it is \"cluck\" and it is pronounced with the central vowel /ʌ/. In addition, the Central Texas layer is influenced by several dialects of other South Atlantic States and Northern States, due to settlement history.\n\nThere are many phonological processes which are characteristic for Texan speech. However, those processes are on no account universal in Texan English and each Texan may speak only some of the characteristics displayed below or even none. In addition, other regional dialects in the United States or dialects from other countries may share some of these features. In particular, dialects from other Southern states share many phonological characteristics of the language spoken in Texas.\n\nLinguists propose that urbanization, geographic and social mobility, and the mass media have homogenized the speech of the United States to a national norm. Consequently, dialect differences are disappearing.\n\nDue to rapid urbanization, increasing dominance of high tech industries, and massive migration Texan speech has been reshaped as well, especially since 1990. Whereas these changes are mainly phonological phenomena, changes in the Lexicon of Texan English can be detected as well. As much of the traditional regional vocabulary concerned farming and rural life these terms are now disappearing or being replaced by technical (book) terms. The general tendency in the phonology of Texas English is that mergers expand at the expense of distinctions although traditionally, Texan Speech was determined by phonemic distinctions. Guy Bailey identifies 11 changes:\n\n\nTexan English phonology stereotypically is defined by the monophthongization of /aɪ/ (e.g. \"price\" is pronounced like [pɹaːs]), which is best reported in Dallas, Lubbock, and Odessa; other Texan cities, however, are reported as usually preserving the diphthong pronunciation of /aɪ/ (e.g. \"price\" pronounced as [pɹaɪs]). Latest findings show a strong orientation of primarily young and urban Texans towards a diphthongization of /aɪ/. In fact, the monophthongization of /aɪ/ has left the central Texan speech almost entirely. 89% of the \"younger\" speakers aged 21–30, use diphthongal realizations of /aɪ/, whereas only 11% use monophthongal or intermediate realizations of /aɪ/. The change toward the diphthongization of /aɪ/ is led by young female Texans, as 92% of the 11% still using the monophthongization were males.\n\nAnother linguistic change in Texan English is an emerging rural–urban split, meaning that most stereotypically and traditionally Southern or Texan features remain strong in rural areas, whereas many of these features tend to disappear in large urban areas and small cities. The urban-rural linguistic split mainly affects phonological phenomena. \n\nSouthern American English has unique grammatical features which do not occur in Standard English, and as settlement patterns indicate, Texas English shares many of these characteristics with other states of the American South.\n\nNo other grammatical feature has been more associated with Southern American English than \"y’all\" as the second person plural pronoun. As a list of phonological and grammatical features documented in Texas by Guy Bailey shows, it is also used frequently in Texan English. As David B. Parker found out, the term \"y’all\" first appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger (published in Richmond, Virginia) in April 1858. The term was used by an American humorist of the mid-nineteenth century, \"Mozis Addums,\" penname of George William Bagby, describing the crowded conditions in the Washington D.C. boarding house where he was living:\n\nThe origin of \"y’all\" is an often debated question. Some clearly see it as a contraction of \"you\" and \"all\" whereas others like Montgomery point out the primary stress on \"you\" and the secondary on \"all\" would create \"you’ll\" as a contraction instead of \"y’all\".\nThus sees it as a grammaticalized form of \"you\" coming from the Scots-Irish \"ye aw\". This leads to the next question of \"y’all\" being used as only plural or also singular. Montgomery describes \"y’all\" as having the following six properties:\n\n\nMost linguists, however, agree on \"y’all\" being used as the second person plural pronoun and therefore no singular reference is possible. (Note that an associative plural \"y'all\" might be used in the context of a single person, but its \"reference\" is always strictly plural.)\n\n\"All y'all\" may be used to refer to a broader group of people when \"y'all\" has already referred to a constituent subgroup. \"All y'alls\" may then expand the group of reference to another degree.\n\nIt is not clear where the term comes from and when it was first used. According to dialect dictionaries, \"fixin' to\" is associated with southern speech and is most often defined as being a synonym of \"preparing to\" or \"intending to\". In sentences like (a) fixin' to may mean something like \"about to\" or \"planning to\". Sentence (b) expresses more the intention of doing something, in this case the speaker intended to come. However, some linguists, i.e. Marvin K. Ching, regard it as being a \"quasimodal\" rather than a verb followed by an infinitive. As can be found in the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, the term is used by 57% of the population of Upper Texas and by 43% in Lower Texas. It is a term used by all social groups, although more frequently by people with a lower social status than by members of the educated upper classes. Furthermore, it is more common in the speech of younger people than in that of older people. The term is also more prevalent in rural areas than in urban areas. In addition, the term functions as an indicator for being from the South. As Ching points out, the precise meaning of the term \"depends much upon its inherent linguistic meaning, which changes in shades of meaning with lexical and syntactic choice\". In other words, the term is used in different situations with a variety of meanings. Nevertheless, the meaning is mostly clear to speaker and addressee when used in a particular situation and when both actors are familiar with the term \"fixin' to\".\n\nStandard English has a strict word order. In the case of modal auxiliaries Standard English is restricted to a single modal per verb phrase. Nevertheless, Texans have constructions which combine more than one modal auxiliary within the same verb phrase: \"I might could do that\".\n\nThese constructions are used by every social class and are, as proven by the data of the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, predominately used in the eastern parts of Texas (Upper East Texas and Lower East Texas). There are different opinions on which class preferably uses the term. Atwood, for example, finds that educated people try to avoid multiple modals, whereas Montgomery suggests the opposite. Considering all findings of different linguists who examined multiple modals in Southern speech, it can be said that multiple modals are quite widespread and are not particularly stigmatized.\n\nPossible double modals used by Texans as examined by Di Paolo are:\n\nAs the table shows, there are only possible combinations of an epistemic modal followed by deontic modals in multiple modal constructions. Deontic modals express permissibility with a range from obligated to forbidden and are mostly used as markers of politeness in requests whereas epistemic modals refer to probabilities from certain to impossible. Multiple modals combine these two modalities.\n\nThe origin of multiple modals is controversial. Some say it is a development of Modern English, others found out that double modals already existed in Middle English and again others suggest that it derives from Scots-Irish settlers.\n\nBeside the three already mentioned grammatical features, there are a few others which aren’t used or are only rarely used today:\n\nExamples: \n\nThe construction is called \"a-prefixing\", because the \"a\" is seen as a prefix placed before the \"–ing\" participle form. Most often it occurs with progressive forms as it is the case in sentence (a). Other syntactic contexts in which a-prefixing occurs are as in sentence (b), with movement words such as \"come\", \"go\" and \"take off\" or together with words of starting and continuing such as in sentence (c) and (d). Together with these words it functions as a type of adverbial complement to the verb.\n\nPhonological restrictions of a-prefixing include that only verbs accented on the initial syllable can occur in the form of \"a\" plus \"verb-ing\": \"a-fóllowin\" but not *\"a-discóverin\". Moreover, it cannot occur on \"–ing\" forms functioning as nouns or adjectives. Thus, sentences like \"*the movie was a-charmin’\" are ungrammatical. 'A' can only be a prefix of verbs or complements of verbs with \"–ing\". As Frazer found out a-prefixing is more likely to be found in the speech of elderly people and might therefore disappear in a few years.\n\nThis kind of grammatical feature is most often used in Black English Vernacular but also white people in Texas use it. Bailey, Maynor and Cukor-Avila examined that 70% of the black population and 43% of the white population put an \"–s\" on the third person plural in folk speech. But here again the use of the third person singular marker \"–s\" in the plural is also declining in frequency.\n\nStandard English would prefer: \"There is nothing more to say\" and in the second example: \"There is a friend of mine who likes to hear that kind of music\".\n\nAccordingly, in Texan English some people use \"existential it\" instead of \"existential there\". \"Existential there\" is used to say that something exists rather than saying where it is located. The construction can be found in Middle English as in Marlowe's Edward II: \"Cousin, it is no dealing with him now\".\n\nLike't'a is a conjunction of \"like to have\" coming from Appalachian English. It is most often seen as a synonym of almost. Accordingly, the phrase \"I like't'a died\" would be \"I almost died\" in Standard English. With this meaning, \"like't'a\" can be seen as a verb modifier for actions that are on the verge of happening. Furthermore, it is more often used in figurative than in a literal sense.\n\nThe past participle form of \"do\" together with a past verb form may be used to emphasize the whole action as in sentence (b) or to put emphasis on the completion of the action as in sentence (a). The form can be found not only in Texan English, but also in other varieties of Southern American English and African American vernaculars.\n\nMany of these lexical terms are shared with the Midland and Southern dialects generally:\n\nDue to Spain's past influence in Texas, the vocabulary of Texas is much more influenced by Spanish than the vocabulary of other states. Some of the Texan terms that originated from Spanish are listed below.\n\n\n\nPeople from Texas often make use of conditional syntaxes as shown below:\n\nConditional syntax in requests:\n\nConditional syntax in suggestions:\nConditional syntax creates a distance between the speaker’s claim and the hearer. It serves to soften obligations or suggestions, make criticisms less personal, and to express politeness, respect, or courtesy.\n\nTexans also often use \"evidential\" predicates such as think, reckon, believe, guess, have the feeling, etc.:\n\nEvidential predicates indicate the certainty of the knowledge asserted in the sentence is, or how it was acquired. According to Johnston, evidential predicates nearly always hedge the assertions and allow the respondents to hedge theirs. They protect speakers from the social embarrassment that appears, in case the assertion turns out to be wrong. As is the case with conditional syntax, evidential predicates can also be used to soften criticisms and to afford courtesy or respect.\n\nIn its beginning Texas was populated by numerous native tribes before the first European explorers arrived. The Spanish were the first Europeans to visit the region in the 16th and 17th centuries. Since then Texas had continuously been a part of New Spain. Except for the native languages Spanish was the first language spoken in Texas. After Mexico gained independence in 1821, Texas opened up to Anglo Settlements in the 1820s. Following the influx of English-speaking whites from the United States, English became as common as Spanish in central and north Texas while South Texas remained largely Spanish speaking.\n\nDue to the immigration of mainly southern states of the United States, the English language was mainly introduced from the old South. Immigrants who migrated to the east and southeast parts of Texas included Anglos from the lower or coastal South states such as Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana whereas Anglos from the Upper South (Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, the Carolinas, Missouri, and Arkansas) dominated most of northern and central Texas. The immigration from the lower and coastal South to southern Texas can be proven by the 1850 census returns of Jefferson County, located in southeastern Texas. In this census citizens of Jefferson County named their origin among other things. The 1850 census returns of Grayson County which is located in the northeast of Texas proved that immigrants who moved to this area mainly came from the Upper South. Any attempt to make an assumption of the immigration to West Texas is not possible due to the lack of information in the 1860 census concerning the origin of immigrants. However, after a military campaign against the Indians in 1875 the number of immigrants in West Texas grew rapidly. In 1896 400,000 persons moved to north-central Texas, half of which came from northern Arkansas, and Tennessee.\n\nAfter the Texas Revolution Texas became an independent republic in 1836. As a result, Anglos outnumbered Hispanics and English became the predominant language in Texas. However, Spanish did not simply disappear but was united with the language and culture of the new settlers making a new kind of dialect. Nevertheless, the formation of what we call Texan English was not finished until the 19th century when immigrants from Europe came in great numbers to Texas. The language they brought with them strongly influenced general English as well as Texan English. The migration from Europe to Texas or the USA in general continued in the 20th century and was increased by other immigrants from all over the world, especially from Mexico. In the beginning of the 20th century after the Mexican Revolution of 1910-1920 there was a great number of Mexicans which immigrated to Texas. This then slowed down in the mid of the 20th century only to increase massively since 1990. Due to the large number of Mexican immigrants Spanish will continue to have a great influence on the Texan dialect of English.\n\nThe history of immigration not only made English the predominant language, but also led to a difference between the pronunciation in West Texas and East Texas. This difference can be easily explained by the migration history of Texas in which different states of the United States and different countries of Europe settled in certain areas, thus \"creating a dialectal zone of transition between East and West Texas\". \nTexas had a unique history, an individual migration process, and an existence as an independent Republic. All these factors contributed to form Texan English.\n\nTexan English frequently shows up in the media. In the 1950s and 1960s many Hollywood western movies like \"Giant\", \"Hud\", and \"The Alamo\" were set in Texas. In those movies the Texan dialect took a big part. In fact, Hollywood stars like James Dean, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper, Paul Newman, and Patricia Neal first had to learn how to speak Texan English and were instructed by native Texans. Also the famous TV series \"\"Dallas\"\" was often characterized by Texan English.\n\nTexas Instruments sometimes uses Texan English in its products. The TIFORM software for its TI-990 minicomputer sometimes displayed \"Shut 'er Down Clancey She's a-Pumping Mud\". Its documentation defined the error message as \"An error has occurred in the TIFORM Executor which is not identifiable. Please call the TI customer representative\".\n\nThe Texan accent gained nationwide fame with the presidency of native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. A lifelong resident of the Texas Hill Country, Johnson's thick accent was a large part of his personality and brought attention and fame to the dialect.\n\nThe Texan dialect gained fame again when George W. Bush started to serve as president. The former President, who moved to West Texas at the age of two, always emphasized his connection to Texas by retaining his dialect during his time in office. His dialect was particularly heavy. Words like America sometimes sounded like \"Amur-kah\" or even just like \"Mur-kah\". Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also speaks with a distinctively Texan accent.\n\nAlthough the state of Texas does not have an official language, the majority of all Texans speak English. Because of the large number of Spanish-speaking immigrants from Mexico, Spanish is the second most widespread language. \nAbout 14 million Texan residents speak exclusively English, which is around two-thirds of the people over five years old in Texas. Due to thousands of Mexican immigrants, around 6 million (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.\nRecent data shows that Spanish is still increasing. Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas, Spanish has a high impact on the English dialect spoken in Texas. For instance, many Texan English words are derived or adopted from Spanish. Many Mexican Americans in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.). This dialect is called Tejano English (TE) and is mostly spoken by working-class Mexican Americans. A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position. In addition to Spanish, there are several other non-English languages, but compared to Spanish they are not very common (see table).\n\nSource:\n\n"}

He pretends to ignore his nose in fear it will be mentioned, and studies religious texts in a desperate attempt to find a person with a nose like his. When in private, he constantly checks his nose in a mirror, hoping for even the smallest amount of shrinkage.\n\nOne autumn, a disciple reveals he has learned a new technique to shrink noses from a friend, a Chinese doctor who has become a high-ranking priest at the Chōrakuji temple in Kyoto. At first, Naigu feigns disinterest, to appeal to the misconception that he is unconcerned with his nose, but eventually “gives in” to his disciple’s insisting. The disciple first boils the nose, then stomps on it, finally removing the beads of fat the treatment extracts from the nose. To Naigu’s satisfaction, the nose, once dangling past his chin, is now the size of a typical hooked nose.\n\nNaigu, excited but nervous, sets about his weekly routines. He is surprised, however, to find the people he encounters laughing at him far more openly than they had before. Naigu becomes bitter and harsh, to the point where one disciple proclaims: “Naigu will be punished for treating us so harshly instead of teaching us Buddha’s Law”. People continue to laugh at Naigu for his vanity, until one day, Naigu wakes up, and to his relief and rejoicing, his nose has returned to its original length.\n\n\nAkutagawa explores the themes of vanity and egoism in \"The Nose\". Naigu’s vanity leads him to obsess only with his nose. This vanity eventually breeds disfigurement and a coldness from his peers, recognizing Naigu’s egotism taking precedence over his religious studies and teaching. Instead of his status as a renowned priest, Naigu views his nose as the source of how society will judge him. As is typical with Akutagawa, these inherently modern psychological themes are directly injected into ancient stories and myth.\n\nAkutagawa gained much of his initial fame from \"The Nose\", one of his earliest works.\n\nAfter reading \"The Nose\", the renowned writer Natsume Sōseki sent a letter to Akutagawa, praising his work:\n\nThe story makes numerous references to the Buddhist scriptures, mentioning many characters from them, such as Mokuren, Sharihotsu, Ryūju, Memyō, and the Bodhisattvas\nIt also makes reference to a Chinese story where the Chinese Shu Han emperor Liu Bei is said to have had long ears.\n\nThe story makes reference to Chōraku-ji Temple, a Buddhist temple in Shimoda, Shizuoka where the story’s Chinese doctor formerly became a high-ranking priest.\n\n\"The Nose\" also makes reference to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, where Naigu is one of the few honored priests able to minister within the palace walls.\n\n"}

According to Plutarch's biography of Alexander the Great, when his forces took Thebes during Alexander's Balkan campaign of 335 BC, Thracian forces pillaged the city, and a captain of the Thracian forces raped Timocleia. After raping her, the captain asked if she knew of any hidden money. She told him that she did, and led him into her garden, and told him there was money hidden in her well. When the Thracian captain stooped to look into the well, Timoclea pushed him into the well, and then hurled heavy stones into the well until the captain was dead.\n\nTimoclea was seized by the Thracian soldiers and brought before Alexander the Great. She comported herself with great dignity and told Alexander that her brother was Theagenes, last commander of the Theban Sacred Band, who died \"for the liberty of Greece\" at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, defeated by Alexander's father Philip of Macedon. Alexander was so impressed with Timocleia that he ordered her and her children released and she was not punished for killing the Thracian captain. \n\nThe story in the \"Mulierum virtutes\" is essentially the same, except that the captain is told that the treasure, of silver bowls, gold and some money, was at the bottom of a dry well, which he climbs down into. When Timoclea hears that he has reached the bottom, she throws down rocks on him. Alexander dismisses her without punishment but does not set her or her family free. He instead tells his officers to take special care of them and other renowned families, making sure there is no more abuse.\nPlutarch's main source for the incident, as he mentions in passing elsewhere, was the account by Aristobulus of Cassandreia, who knew Alexander well; this survives only in quotations by others, which may not all be accurate. The taking of Thebes took place in the second year of Alexander's reign, and was otherwise a very bloody affair, as the city was the leader in a Greek revolt, taking advantage of Philip's assassination, against the treaties he had enforced. Perhaps 6,000 Thebans died, and 30,000 were enslaved, and the city virtually ceased to exist for some decades. The only other act of clemency recorded is that Alexander ordered the house and descendants of the poet Pindar (died c. 443 BC) to be left alone. \n\nTimoclea was a rare subject in art from the Renaissance onwards, never becoming a regular subject in the range of incidents showing classical and biblical female violence against men known as the Power of Women topos. But she featured in cycles on the \"Life of Alexander\", and there was an increasing tendency in court art to depict Alexander as a proxy for the actual monarch, and to emphasize acts of generosity or mercy. \n\nMost depictions show her brought before Alexander, which might form part of a cycle illustrating his life. This was the case in the cycle of frescos painted in the Palace of Fontainebleau in the 1540s by Francesco Primaticcio and his team. This was in the bedroom of Francois I's mistress, the Duchess of Étampes (1508–1580), and a total of eleven compositions surviving today are known from surviving paintings or prints or drawings. The cycle showed the life of Alexander, but with little emphasis on his military career. This was one of the three subjects from the cycle etched as a print by Léon Davent. Unusually in this subject, but rather typically for the First School of Fontainebleau, Timoclea is naked when brought to Alexander. \n\nHere and in other depictions, the subject was given a composition similar to ones of the much more common \"The Continence of Scipio\"; the subject likewise emphasized the magnamimity of the commander. Timoclea sometimes accompanied the \"Continence\" in a series, and is also capable of being confused with it. Bernard de Montfaucon paired the two stories as his \"Examples of the clemency and continence of conquerors\" in a book of 1724.\n\nAs the \"Life of Alexander\" was a popular subject, the story of Timoclea probably would have been more a popular element if there had not been a grander and less sordid competitor in the form of The Family of Darius before Alexander, best known from Veronese's painting in London, which was normally included in cycles, and also showed Alexander being generous to women captives brought before him. \n\nThe most influential image of Timoclea's story, judging by copies in prints for two centuries after, was the painting by Domenichino of c. 1615, which was in the French royal collection from the time of Louis XIV, and then the Louvre. Unlike most depictions, this shows her children prominently. A very different composition, showing only one and a half figures, with the Thracian disappearing upside down into the well, first appears in an engraving of 1629–30 by Matthäus Merian, a book illustration for a popular German world history by Johann Ludwig Gottfried. This was later adapted in an oil painting by Elisabetta Sirani.\n\nA play, now lost, called \"Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes\" was performed at Hampton Court Palace before Elizabeth I and the English court at Candlemas 1574, on February 2 (this was five years before the influential English translation of Plutarch by Thomas North was published). The author is unknown, and the performers were boys from the Merchant Taylor's School, London, directed by their master Richard Mulcaster. They were one of a number of companies of boy players active in English Renaissance theatre in London. The performance and its expenses was recorded in the accounts of the Master of the Revels, and from the number of children's gloves paid for may have included twenty four performers. It may not have been a great success, as the masque prepared to follow it, with ladies \"with lightes being vj vertues\" was \"not showen for the Tediusnesse of the playe that nighte.\"\n\nTimoclea also appears in \"Gynaikeion or Nine Books of Various History Concerning Women\" by Thomas Heywood, 1624, and as a minor character in John Lyly's play \"Campaspe\", a comedy also performed by boy players. According to this, Timoclea and Campaspe were both captives at Alexander's conquest of Thebes, and are brought together before Alexander, where Timoclea's aristocratic dignity contrasts with Campaspe's self-description as \"a humble handmaid to Alexander\". Campaspe was later the mistress of Alexander and his painter Apelles, and is a common story depicted in Alexander's life in art.\n\n"}
{"id": "29920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29920", "title": "Truth", "text": "Truth\n\nTruth is most often used to mean being in accord with fact or reality, or fidelity to an original or standard. Truth is also sometimes defined in modern contexts as an idea of \"truth to self\", or authenticity.\n\nTruth is usually held to be opposite to falsehood, which, correspondingly, can also suggest a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The concept of truth is discussed and debated in several contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the sciences, law, journalism, and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. To some, truth is viewed as the correspondence of language or thought to an independent reality, in what is sometimes called the correspondence theory of truth.\n\nVarious theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians. Language is a means by which humans convey information to one another. The method used to determine whether something is a truth is termed a criterion of truth. There are varying stances on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are truthbearers capable of being true or false; how to define, identify, and distinguish truth; what roles do faith and empirical knowledge play; and whether truth can be subjective or is objective: relative truth versus absolute truth.\n\nThe English word \"truth\" is derived from Old English \"tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ\", Middle English \"trewþe\", cognate to Old High German \"triuwida\", Old Norse \"tryggð\". Like \"troth\", it is a \"-th\" nominalisation of the adjective \"true\" (Old English \"tréowe\").\n\nThe English word \"true\" is from Old English (West Saxon) \"(ge)tríewe, tréowe\", cognate to Old Saxon \"(gi)trûui\", Old High German \"(ga)triuwu\" (Modern German \"treu\" \"faithful\"), Old Norse \"tryggr\", Gothic \"triggws\", all from a Proto-Germanic \"*trewwj-\" \"having good faith\", perhaps ultimately from PIE *dru- \"tree\", on the notion of \"steadfast as an oak\" (e.g., Sanskrit \"taru\" tree).\nOld Norse ', \"faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief\" (archaic English \"troth\" \"loyalty, honesty, good faith\", compare ').\n\nThus, 'truth' involves both the quality of \"faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity\", and that of \"agreement with fact or reality\", in Anglo-Saxon expressed by \"sōþ\" (Modern English \"sooth\").\n\nAll Germanic languages besides English have introduced a terminological distinction between truth \"fidelity\" and truth \"factuality\". To express \"factuality\", North Germanic opted for nouns derived from \"sanna\" \"to assert, affirm\", while continental West Germanic (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of \"wâra\" \"faith, trust, pact\" (cognate to Slavic \"věra\" \"(religious) faith\", but influenced by Latin \"verus\"). Romance languages use terms following the Latin \"veritas\", while the Greek \"aletheia\", Russian \"pravda\" and South Slavic \"istina\" have separate etymological origins.\n\nThe question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories of truth listed below. Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.\n\nTheories other than the most prevalent substantive theories are also discussed. More recently developed \"deflationary\" or \"minimalist\" theories of truth have emerged as possible alternatives to the most prevalent substantive theories. Minimalist reasoning centres around the notion that the application of a term like \"true\" to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its \"nature\". Minimalist reasoning realises \"truth\" as a label utilised in general discourse to express agreement, to stress claims, or to form general assumptions.\n\nCorrespondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs. This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to ancient Greek philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to \"things\", by whether it accurately describes those \"things.\" A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian Thomas Aquinas: \"Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus\" (\"Truth is the adequation of things and intellect\"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century Neoplatonist Isaac Israeli. Aquinas also restated the theory as: \"A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality\".\n\nCorrespondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as \"objective reality\" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols. Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors. For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The German word \"Zeitgeist\" is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may \"know\" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in agglutinative languages). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate truth predicate. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is Alfred Tarski, whose semantic theory is summarized further below in this article.\n\nProponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth.\n\nFor coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system. A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole. Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.\n\nSome variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of formal systems in logic and mathematics. However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate axiomatically independent and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various alternative geometries. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the natural world, empirical data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.\n\nCoherence theories distinguish the thought of rationalist philosophers, particularly of Spinoza, Leibniz, and G.W.F. Hegel, along with the British philosopher F.H. Bradley. They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of logical positivism, notably Otto Neurath and Carl Hempel.\n\nSocial constructivism holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as \"constructed,\" because it does not reflect any external \"transcendent\" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold). Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including race, sexuality, and gender, are socially constructed.\n\nGiambattista Vico was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's epistemological orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom—\"verum ipsum factum\"—\"truth itself is constructed\". Hegel and Marx were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is \"in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history\" and ideological knowledge is \"an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement\".\n\nConsensus theory holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a subset thereof consisting of more than one person.\n\nAmong the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of \"truth\" is the philosopher Jürgen Habermas. Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an ideal speech situation. Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher Nicholas Rescher.\n\nIn the Islamic tradition, this principle is exemplified by the hadith in which Muhammad states, \"My community will never agree upon an error\"\n\nThe three most influential forms of the \"pragmatic theory of truth\" were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and John Dewey. Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.\n\nPeirce defines truth as follows: \"Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth.\" This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as \"fallibilism\" and \"reference to the future\", are essential to a proper conception of truth. Although Peirce uses words like \"concordance\" and \"correspondence\" to describe one aspect of the pragmatic sign relation, he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than \"nominal\" definitions, which he accords a lower status than \"real\" definitions.\n\nWilliam James's version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that \"the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving.\" By this, James meant that truth is a \"quality\", the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, \"pragmatic\").\n\nJohn Dewey, less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that inquiry, whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time \"if\" openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.\n\nThough not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by William Ernest Hocking, this variation is known as \"negative pragmatism\". Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works. Richard Feynman also ascribed to it: \"We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong.\" This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey. For Peirce, the idea of \"... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ...\" fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing. As Feynman noted, an idea or theory \"... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right.\" Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is \"self-corrective\" over time.\n\nPragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the coherence theory of truth in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience. The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity. As Feynman said, \"... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong.\"\n\nModern developments in the field of philosophy, starting with the relatively modern notion that a theory being old does not necessarily imply that it is completely flawless, have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term \"truth\" does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of \"truth predicates\" (e.g., that some particular thing \"...is true\") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century. From this point of view, to assert that \"'2 + 2 = 4' is true\" is logically equivalent to asserting that \"2 + 2 = 4\", and the phrase \"is true\" is completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account and work with sentence structures that are actually employed in common discourse can be broadly described:\n\nWhichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that \"[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis.\" Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it \"does\" appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., Semantic paradoxes, and below.)\n\nIn addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate \"is true\", some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:\nThis assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: \"What Michael says is true\".\n\nAttributed to P. F. Strawson is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say \"'Snow is white' is true\" is to perform the speech act of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the bride says \"I do\" at the appropriate time in a wedding, she is performing the act of taking this man to be her lawful wedded husband. She is not \"describing\" herself as taking this man, but actually doing so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such \"illocutionary acts\" is J. L. Austin, \"How to Do Things With Words\").\n\nStrawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: \"To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement. When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.' The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'\"\n\nAccording to the redundancy theory of truth, asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself. For example, making the assertion that \" 'Snow is white' is true\" is equivalent to asserting \"Snow is white\". Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality. This theory is commonly attributed to Frank P. Ramsey, who held that the use of words like \"fact\" and \"truth\" was nothing but a roundabout way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a \"linguistic muddle\".\n\nA variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of Tarski's schema: To say that '\"P\" is true' is to say that P. A version of this theory was defended by C. J. F. Williams in his book \"What is Truth?\". Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and Nuel Belnap as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims. They argue that sentences like \"That's true\", when said in response to \"It's raining\", are prosentences, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions. In the same way that \"it\" means the same as \"my dog\" in the sentence \"My dog was hungry, so I fed it\", \"That's true\" is supposed to mean the same as \"It's raining\"—if you say the latter and I then say the former. These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is \"not\" a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion \"P\" may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as \"that's true.\"\n\nDeflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise. Consider the analogy between the sentence \"Snow is white\" and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense. To a minimalist, saying \"Snow is white is true\" is the same as saying \"Snow is white,\" but to say \"Snow White is true\" is \"not\" the same as saying \"Snow White.\"\n\nPhilosophical skepticism is generally any questioning attitude or doubt towards one or more items of knowledge or belief which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions. It is often directed at domains, such as the supernatural, morality (moral skepticism), religion (skepticism about the existence of God), or knowledge (skepticism about the possibility of knowledge, or of certainty). Formally, skepticism as a topic occurs in the context of philosophy, particularly epistemology, although it can be applied to any topic such as politics, religion, and pseudoscience.\n\nPhilosophical skepticism comes in various forms. Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment regarding ascription of truth on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the \"big questions\" in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife. Religious skepticism is \"doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)\". Scientific skepticism concerns testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to systematic investigation using the scientific method, to discover empirical evidence for them.\n\nSeveral of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about.\n\nSome of the pragmatic theories, such as those by Charles Peirce and William James, included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories. Crispin Wright argued in his 1992 book \"Truth and Objectivity\" that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility. Michael Lynch, in a 2009 book \"Truth as One and Many\", argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.\n\nAccording to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November 2009 (taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students) 45% of respondents accept or lean towards correspondence theories, 21% accept or lean towards deflationary theories and 14% epistemic theories.\n\nLogic is concerned with the patterns in reason that can help tell us if a proposition is true or not. However, logic does not deal with truth in the absolute sense, as for instance a metaphysician does. Logicians use formal languages to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some interpretation or truth within some logical system.\n\nA logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement which is true in all possible worlds or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a \"fact\" (also called a \"synthetic claim\" or a \"contingency\") which is only true in this world as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as \"If p and q, then p\" is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the symbols and words in it and not because of any fact of any particular world. They are such that they could not be untrue.\n\nDegrees of truth in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values, as with bivalent logic (or binary logic), three-valued logic, and other forms of finite-valued logic. Truth in logic can be represented using numbers comprising a continuous range, typically between 0 and 1, as with fuzzy logic and other forms of infinite-valued logic. In general, the concept of representing truth using more than two values is known as many-valued logic.\n\nThere are two main approaches to truth in mathematics. They are the \"model theory of truth\" and the \"proof theory of truth\".\n\nHistorically, with the nineteenth century development of Boolean algebra mathematical models of logic began to treat \"truth\", also represented as \"T\" or \"1\", as an arbitrary constant. \"Falsity\" is also an arbitrary constant, which can be represented as \"F\" or \"0\". In propositional logic, these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of axioms and rules of inference, often given in the form of truth tables.\n\nIn addition, from at least the time of Hilbert's program at the turn of the twentieth century to the proof of Gödel's incompleteness theorems and the development of the Church–Turing thesis in the early part of that century, true statements in mathematics were generally assumed to be those statements that are provable in a formal axiomatic system.\n\nThe works of Kurt Gödel, Alan Turing, and others shook this assumption, with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system. Two examples of the latter can be found in Hilbert's problems. Work on Hilbert's 10th problem led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific Diophantine equations for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution, or even if they do, whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions. More fundamentally, Hilbert's first problem was on the continuum hypothesis. Gödel and Paul Cohen showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard axioms of set theory. In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom.\n\nReconsidered assumptions about the essence of truth arose in the wake of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Martin Heidegger pointed out that truth may be essentially a matter of letting beings (entities of any kind, which can include logical propositions) be free to reveal themselves as they are, and stated:\nGödel agreed that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of intuition, an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics and perhaps best considered in the realm of human comprehension and communication, but commented:\nThe semantic theory of truth has as its general case for a given language:\nwhere 'P' refers to the sentence (the sentence's name), and P is just the sentence itself.\n\nTarski's theory of truth (named after Alfred Tarski) was developed for formal languages, such as formal logic. Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression \"is true\" could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an \"object language\", the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain paradoxical sentences such as, \"This sentence is not true\". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. Donald Davidson used it as the foundation of his truth-conditional semantics and linked it to radical interpretation in a form of coherentism.\n\nBertrand Russell is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, Russell's paradox. Russell and Whitehead attempted to solve these problems in \"Principia Mathematica\" by putting statements into a hierarchy of types, wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy. This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible type systems that have yet to be resolved to this day.\n\nKripke's theory of truth (named after Saul Kripke) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:\n\nNotice that truth never gets defined for sentences like \"This sentence is false\", since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are \"ungrounded.\" Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the Principle of bivalence: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the Liar paradox, the paradox is dissolved.\n\nHowever, it has been shown by Gödel that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in Gödel's work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea—manifested by the diagonal lemma—is the basis for Tarski's theorem that truth cannot be consistently defined.\n\nIt has thus been claimed that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. While there is still a debate on whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system, none have been shown to be consistent by acceptable methods used in mathematical logic.\n\nThe revision theory of truth, as developed by Anil Gupta and Nuel Belnap, takes truth to be a circular concept whose definition is the set of biconditionals of the form\nUnlike Kripke's theory of truth, revision theory can be used with classical logic and can maintain the principle of bivalence.\n\nThe truth predicate \"\"P\" is true\" has great practical value in human language, allowing us to \"efficiently\" endorse or impeach claims made by others, to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement, or to enable various indirect (Gricean) conversational implications. Individuals or societies will sometime punish \"false\" statements to deter falsehoods; the oldest surviving law text, the Code of Ur-Nammu, lists penalties for false accusations of sorcery or adultery, as well as for committing perjury in court. Even four-year-old children can pass simple \"false belief\" tests and successfully assess that another individual's belief diverges from reality in a specific way; by adulthood we have strong implicit intuitions about \"truth\" that form a \"folk theory\" of truth. These intuitions include:\n\n\nLike many folk theories, our folk theory of truth is useful in everyday life but, upon deep analysis, turns out to be technically self-contradictory; in particular, any formal system that fully obeys Capture and Release semantics for truth (also known as the \"T-schema\"), and that also respects classical logic, is provably inconsistent and succumbs to the liar paradox or to a similar contradiction.\n\nThe ancient Greek origins of the words \"true\" and \"truth\" have some consistent definitions throughout great spans of history that were often associated with topics of logic, geometry, mathematics, deduction, induction, and natural philosophy.\n\nSocrates', Plato's and Aristotle's ideas about truth are seen by some as consistent with correspondence theory. In his \"Metaphysics\", Aristotle stated: \"To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true\". The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy proceeds to say of Aristotle:\n\n[...] Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the \"Categories\" (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of \"underlying things\" that make statements true and implies that these \"things\" (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in \"De Interpretatione\" (16a3) that thoughts are \"likenesses\" (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind. [...]\n\nVery similar statements can also be found in Plato (Cratylus 385b2, Sophist 263b).\n\nIn Hinduism, Truth is defined as \"unchangeable\", \"that which has no distortion\", \"that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person\", \"that which pervades the universe in all its constancy\". The human body, therefore is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as the national motto of India: \"Satyameva Jayate\" (Truth alone wins), as well as \"Satyam muktaye\" (Truth liberates), \"Satya' is 'Parahit'artham' va'unmanaso yatha'rthatvam' satyam\" (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), \"When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him ( patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36 ), \"The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. \"Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!\"\" (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1–4 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15–18), Truth is superior to silence (Manusmriti), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as modifier, like \"ultra\" or \"highest,\" or more literally \"truest,\" connoting purity and excellence. For example, satyaloka is the \"highest heaven' and Satya Yuga is the \"golden age\" or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on.\n\nIn early Islamic philosophy, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work Kitab Al-Shifa \"The Book of Healing\", Book I, Chapter 8, as:\n\nAvicenna elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6:\n\nHowever, this definition is merely a rendering of the medieval Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet. A modern translation of the original Arabic text states:\n\nReevaluating Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas stated in his \"Disputed Questions on Truth\":\n\nThus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth). Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his Summa I.16.1:\n\nRichard Firth Green examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his \"A Crisis of Truth\", and concludes that roughly during the reign of Richard II of England the very meaning of the concept changes. The idea of the oath, which was so much part and parcel of for instance Romance literature, changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one (in Derek Pearsall's summary). Whereas truth (the \"trouthe\" of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\") was first \"an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons\", in Ricardian England it \"transforms...into a political truth in which truth is understood to reside in documents\".\n\nImmanuel Kant endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth. Kant writes in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\": \"The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed\". However, Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. Kant states in his logic lectures:\n[...] Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only \"by cognizing it\". Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object.\n\nThe ancients called such a circle in explanation a \"diallelon\". And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man. [...]\nThis passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain objects and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition. Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is \"impossible without qualification and for every man\".\n\nGeorg Hegel distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the mechanics of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. \"Truth is its own self-movement within itself.\" Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of dialectical triplicity toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. Chalybäus used the terms \"thesis\", \"antithesis\", and \"synthesis\" to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity. The \"thesis\" consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an \"antithesis\" occurs which opposes the \"thesis.\" In turn, the \"synthesis\" appears when the \"thesis\" and \"antithesis\" become reconciled and a higher level of truth is obtained. This \"synthesis\" thereby becomes a \"thesis,\" which will again necessitate an \"antithesis,\" requiring a new \"synthesis\" until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the Absolute Spirit moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite God.\n\nFor Arthur Schopenhauer, a judgment is a combination or separation of two or more concepts. If a judgment is to be an expression of knowledge, it must have a sufficient reason or ground by which the judgment could be called true. \"Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)\". Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has \"material\" truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or \"formal\". If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has \"transcendental\" truth.\n\nWhen Søren Kierkegaard, as his character \"Johannes Climacus\", ends his writings: \"My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth\", he does not advocate for subjectivism in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.\n\nWhile objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the \"will to power\" of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the \"will to power\", and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in \"Beyond Good and Evil\", \"The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding...\" (aphorism 4). He proposed the \"will to power\" as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.\n\nRobert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows:\n[...] Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, \"On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense\" (\"Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn\") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call \"truth\" is only \"a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms.\" His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; \"truth\" is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence. [...]\n\nSeparately Nietzsche suggested that an ancient, metaphysical belief in the divinity of Truth lies at the heart of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent Western intellectual tradition: \"But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests—that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take \"our\" fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato's faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is 'Divine'...\"\n\nOther philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative. According to Martin Heidegger, the original meaning and essence of truth in Ancient Greece was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, \"aletheia\". On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the Latin term \"veritas\".\n\nAlfred North Whitehead, a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, said: \"There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil\".\n\nThe logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since half-truths are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion.\n\nPragmatists like C. S. Peirce take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and discovering truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human inquiry would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: \"The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth...\"\n\nAccording to Kitaro Nishida, \"knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing.\"\n\nErich Fromm finds that trying to discuss truth as \"absolute truth\" is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on \"optimal truth\". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in \"a strange and powerful world\". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in \"Man from Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics\" (1947), from which excerpts are included below.\n\nTruth, says Michel Foucault, is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an \"objective\" quality. He prefers not to use the term truth itself but \"Regimes of Truth\". In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure. Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of Nietzsche. Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various episteme throughout history.\n\nJean Baudrillard considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something. He took his cue from iconoclasts who he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist. Baudrillard wrote in \"Precession of the Simulacra\":\n\nSome examples of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the \"truth\" that society is free; scandals (e.g., Watergate) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. One must remember that though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate.\n\nThere is controversy as to the truth value of a proposition made in bad faith self-deception, such as when a hypochondriac has a complaint with no physical symptom.\n\nReference works\n\n"}

It is also sometimes known as Varbrul analysis, after the name of a software package dedicated to carrying out the relevant statistical computations (\"Varbrul\", from \"variable rule\"). The method goes back to a theoretical approach developed by the sociolinguist William Labov in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and its mathematical implementation was developed by Henrietta Cedergren and David Sankoff in 1974.\n\nA variable rules analysis is designed to provide a quantitative model of a situation where speakers alternate between different forms that have the same meaning and stand in free variation, but in such a way that the probability of choice of either the one or the other form is conditioned by a variety of context factors or social characteristics. Such a situation, where variation is not entirely random but rule-governed, is also known as \"structured variation\". A variable rules analysis computes a multivariate statistical model, on the basis of observed token counts, such that each determining factor is assigned a numerical factor weight that describes how it influences the probabilities of choice of either form. This is done by means of stepwise logistic regression, using a maximum likelihood algorithm.\n\nAlthough the necessary computations required for a variable rules analysis can be carried out with the help of mainstream general-purpose statistics software packages such as SPSS, it is more often done by means of a specialised software dedicated to the needs of linguists, called \"Varbrul\". It was originally written by David Sankoff and currently exists in freeware implementations for Mac OS and Microsoft Windows, under the title of \"Goldvarb X\". There are also versions implemented in the statistical language R and therefore available on most platforms. These include \"R-Varb\" and \"Rbrul\".\n\nVariable rules approaches are commonly employed for the analysis of data in sociolinguistic research, especially in studies that aim to investigate how reflexes of linguistic change through time appear in the shape of structured variation patterns within a speech community.\n\n"}

The folio sized papers, usually written by members of the society, were first published individually, and then later in collected volumes.\n\nThe full title is \"Vetusta monumenta quae ad Rerum Britanicarum memoriam conservandam Societas Antiquariorum Londini sumptu suo edenda curavit\", but the volumes are normally simply cited as \"Vetusta Monumenta\". There were various reprints of both individual papers and collected volumes, and the plates were often published separately from the text. According to the HOLLIS database at Harvard: \"The seven volumes are dated 1747, 1789, 1796, 1815, 1835, 1883 and 1906 (for the fourth part of vol.7). The plates for vol. 1 were published between 1718 and 1747; plates for vol. 2 were published between 1748 and 1789; plates for vol. 3 were published between 1790 and 1796; plates for vol. 4 were published between 1799 and 1815; plates for vol. 5 were published between 1816 and 1835; plates for vol. 6 were published between 1821 and 1885; plates for the four parts of vol. 7 were published between 1893 and 1906.\"\n\nThe series began the same year that the society formalized its existence with the first minuted meeting on January 1, 1718, at the Mitre Tavern, Fleet Street; the society's main journal \"Archaeologia\" did not begin publication until 1770. Members of the society received a free copy as each part was published.\n\nThe emphasis was on the large and detailed illustrations, initially high quality engravings, which conveyed information on the subject matter in an accessible and economical way. Each issue was usually developed from papers and research of the society, giving a text description accompanied by illustrated details it had commissioned. The assemblage of maps, site plans, and other detail was a novelty that found popular appeal.\n\nThe views in the series contained images of people and other means of conveying scale, providing the perspective of the interested visitor. These accompanied text descriptions for the sites, but provided additional information with high levels of detail and multiple or idealised viewpoints to simulate a well informed tour. Many of the plates show the setting, inset with exploded views, cross sections and other architectural details, or objects found at the site. Other figures were interspersed with the text, or taking up several full pages. Critics have compared this approach with contemporaneous works that included the subject as an attractively sketched scene, illustrations were not yet recognised as a valuable source of information. The book used the multiple and separate details to synthesise encyclopaedic surveys that typified the approach of the natural historians and antiquaries, what Barbara Maria Stafford has described as \"cross-referencing material bits of distant reality\".\n\nAn 1803 article on the Rosetta Stone was amongst the earliest published research. The first detailed account of the medieval French Royal Gold Cup in the British Museum was published in one of the last papers, of 1904, by Sir Charles Hercules Read.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of noted contributors, and their articles:\n\nNotices on illustrations mention the following engravers:\n\n"}

It was the first dictionary to be published in the New World. However the most relevant and most famous edition was the one made in 1571, edited by Antonio de Spinosa, which then came to be named \"Vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana\". This new edition included the Nahuatl-to-Spanish section that the original didn't.\n\nThe Franciscan missionaries promoted the writing of literature works to evangelize the Indians in their own language, Nahuatl being language one of the most important considering that it was spoken throughout New Spain. After the Council of Trent, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church recommended to preach in indigenous languages. During the rule of viceroy Martín Enríquez de Almanza, Molina published Spanish-to-Nahuatl and Nahuatl-to-Spanish vocabularies to help the formation of priests that were to accomplish the evangelizing assignments.\n\nMolina's \"Vocabulario\" is considered the most important dictionary of the Classical Nahuatl language and has continued to be reprinted into the 20th century. It is typically referred to simply as \"Molina\".\n\nIt is believed that Nahuatl was the first of the indigenous languages of the Americas to be linguistically studied, since the first preserved grammar of an American language is \"Arte de la lengua mexicana\" (1547) by Andrés de Olmos; moreover, shortly after in 1555, the first vocabulary of an indigenous language was published: Molina's vocabulary.\n\nThis first edition of the dictionary only contained the Spanish-to-Nahuatl section, based on which Molina made the 1571 edition adding the Nahuatl-to-Spanish section.\n\nThe 1571 \"Vocabulary\" de 1571 is divided in two sections, very much like modern bilingual dictionaries, individually foliated: the Spanish-to-Nahuatl section consists of 118 sheets and the Nahuatl-to-Spanish one, of 162 sheets. There are 4 columns on each sheet and each one of them contains approximately 35 entries, thus containing 16500 Spanish-to-Nahuatl entries and 22600 Nahuatl-to-Spanish entries.\n\nThe first section is headed by the printing licenses and a letter to New Spain's viceroy, D. Martínez Enríquez.\n\nBoth sections are preceded by a foreword in which he justifies the work and where a series of notifications about the peculiarities of the Mexican language appeared.\n\nAt the end of the first section there is an attachment, that already appeared in the 1555 edition, where the Franciscan gives grammatical instructions of the numbers in Nahuatl, with equivalences in Spanish.\n\nThere are 7 known editions:\n\n"}

Images and sound files used in YTMNDs are usually either created or edited by users. YTMND is generally a humor website, owing its tone and culture to the original YTMND and its early imitators. Other YTMNDs, however, are artistic or political.\n\nYTMND originated in 2000 from Max Goldberg's original website, \"yourethemannowdog.com\", which he registered along with \"dustindiamond.com\" after seeing a trailer for the movie \"Finding Forrester\" in which Sean Connery says the line \"You're the man now, dog!\". Originally, the website featured the text \"YOURE THE MAN NOW DOG.COM\" drawn out in 3D ASCII text with a sound loop from the \"Finding Forrester\" trailer of Sean Connery reciting the phrase \"You're the man now, dog!\". The advent of zoomed text currently on the website was seen in the following months, where the website also featured a photograph of Sean Connery. Goldberg's new\ncreation inspired others to make similar sites with other movie and television quotations (or any other sound clip they wished to use). At first, Goldberg maintained a list and mirror of these sites, but the list soon became exceptionally long.\n\nIn 2004, Goldberg wrote a press release after winning a lawsuit filed by Dustin Diamond for the \"fan page\" at the aforementioned dustindiamond.com. He mentioned yourethemannowdog.com, as well as a new website, YTMND, that would be ready by April 10. The website opened that day after a rushed coding and design process. The site caught on in popularity and became an Internet phenomenon when major weblogs and Internet forums began linking to the \"Picard Song\" YTMND.\n\nIn November 2005, YTMND changed its layout and added new features, including a comment management system and new lists for the main page. A feature debuted soon after allowing users to donate money on behalf of a YTMND chosen by the user in exchange for its increased exposure through the main site.\n\nOn September 24, 2006, YTMND changed to a new layout and design. The re-design added new features, such as the YTMND digest. \n\nOn August 29, 2016, Max Goldberg that YTMND would likely soon be shutting down, citing ill health and the site's inability to fund its own hosting fees in ad revenue. Goldberg stated \"Besides being a time capsule I don’t really see a reason for it to continue to exist... It seems like the internet has moved on...And I’ve moved on too. I don’t have much interest in the site beyond it being good memories.\" Despite this, the site remains open as of September 2018. On May 12, 2018, the site stopped accepting new user signups as a result of Google shutting down version 1 of its ReCAPTCHA anti-spam mechanism.\n\nIn January 2006, eBaum's World hosted and watermarked a Lindsay Lohan montage created by YTMND user SpliceVW without crediting either SpliceVW or YTMND. In response to their actions, users from YTMND joined users from other Internet communities and launched an attack on the forums on eBaum's World, using spam posting and denial-of-service attacks to repeatedly crash them.\n\nGoldberg denounced the ongoing attacks, stating that they had \"really crossed the line\" and were a \"vulgar display of power\". He later stated that any YTMND member whose site promoted attacks would have his or her account deleted and that the conflict had placed both himself and his hosting company in a negative light.\n\nOn January 10, eBaum's World alleged the attacks were a form of cyberterrorism, and on January 11, Neil Bauman, the executive vice president of eBaum's World, publicly stated that arrests were being made in relation to the attacks. Eventually, Goldberg and Bauman came to an agreement: Bauman removed the montage from his website, and Goldberg removed references to \"eBaum\" from his. Though the conflict was resolved, both sites experienced DDoS attacks on the morning of January 12, 2006.\n\nOn June 10, 2006, a cease and desist form was sent to Goldberg by lawyers of the Church of Scientology, claiming that several YTMND pages with Scientology-related content had infringed on Scientology copyrights. In response, Goldberg replied to the lawyer that the cease and desist form was \"completely groundless\" and he would not be deleting any Scientology-related sites. Days later, a Scientology page section appeared on the front page along with a disclaimer on the bottom stating the following: \"This website is in no way affiliated, sponsored or owned by the Church of Scientology, L. Ron Hubbard, SeaOrg, Dianetics, volcanoes or aliens of any sort. We are, however, sponsored by Citizens for the Release of Xenu, a not-for-sanity organization.\" According to Goldberg, there have not been any recent updates regarding the potential lawsuit.\n\nThe YTMND character \"Moon Man\", a white supremacist rapper character based on source videos of the McDonald's advertising campaign Mac Tonight, garnered controversy shortly after its first remix in 2007. AT&T's text to speech program provided Moon Man's voice and was soon edited to block any racially derogatory epithets or swear words in an attempt to cull the number of remixes. McDonald's began removing existing Mac Tonight sculptures and animatronics from some of its restaurants in response to the widespread remixes, and YouTube began automatically striking down many Moon Man-related videos from 2007 to the present. Several videos were also DMCA-claimed and taken down by McDonald's from 2007–2008. Multiple change.org petitions were filed demanding YouTube cease removing the videos, the most recent of which from May 2015 having reaching over 1200 signatures. YouTube has since stopped taking Moon Man videos down unless they have been flagged by users.\n\nOn January 11, 2007, Goldberg revealed that Sega Europe had sent a cease and desist letter concerning the \"Sonic Says...\" fad, which features a clip from the Sonic animated series. The letter alleged that consumers \"may be confused into believing that [the offending pages are] in someway [sic] linked to or associated with\" the company. In its letter, Sega stated that it would take legal action after seven days if ownership of all \"that's no good\" web domains were not handed over. After almost two weeks of silence following the original 7-day limit, Goldberg declared the issue had \"blown over.\"\n\nOn July 17, 2007, Goldberg received a string of letters and phone calls from lawyers representing Scholastic threatening legal action if sites revealing spoilers for \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\" were not removed, in response to several YTMNDs with scanned pages that Goldberg posted on the front page. As more sites were created with spoilers, additional letters were sent. Goldberg responded to Scholastic by declining to take down Harry Potter-related sites.\n\nIn May 2009, the Pez corporation sent a cease-and-desist letter regarding two YTMNDs depicting fake Pez dispensers with Adolf Hitler and Charles Manson's heads on the containers, which they found insulting, and demanded that YTMND refrain from allowing any Pez-related items to be displayed on the site. Goldberg responded by starting a fad contest involving the candy company, with the prize being a possible lawsuit.\n\nDue to the nature and format of YTMNDs, the site has garnered attention from outside media sources. In 2005, Reuters wrote an article on Tom Cruise which made a reference to the \"Tom Cruise Kills Oprah\" YTMND. The site received further publicity when The Wall Street Journal published an article about YTMND, and mentioned several popular website creations, linking to many of them through their website. The original \"Tom Cruise Kills Oprah\" video, on which the YTMND is based, was mentioned on Dateline NBC's \"The Mank Blog\" segment, VH1's show \"Web Junk 20\", and CBC Newsworld's with George Stroumboulopoulos.\n\nOn the February 1, 2006, episode of \"Attack of the Show!\", viewers were asked to \"make a kickass YTMND\" for the show's \"user created\" segment. In order for sites to qualify for this YTMND competition, members were required to add \"aots\" at the beginning of the site's URL. In March, Game-Revolution held a contest for video game-themed YTMNDs. The winner won a PSP as a prize. In the March 2006 issue of \"Stuff\" magazine, there is a mention of the original \"You're the Man Now Dog\" website. YTMND was again mentioned in the magazine in June 2006 when a link to timetraveler.ytmnd.com was printed. In May, Current TV host and producer Max Lugavere was spotted wearing a YTMND T-shirt on the network. In the August 2006 issue of \"WIRED\", an article under the \"Expert\" column by the name of \"1 Web Site, 250,000 Idiotic Clips. LOL!\" was printed. In the article, five of Goldberg's favorite YTMNDs (You're the Man Now, Dog; Vader Coaster; Lohan Facial; LOL Internet; Blue Ball Machine) were mentioned, along with commentary from Max himself for each one. The article's writer, James Lee, can be quoted as saying \"Repeat an image loop and a sound file – as 24-year-old Max Goldberg with You're the Man Now, Dog – and pretty soon you'll have 4 million visitors a month and 120,000 contributors uploading their own clips.\" Also in August 2006, an effort of YTMND users to post satirical reviews on the Amazon page for Tuscan whole milk was covered by \"The New York Times\".\n\nYTMND was featured in an article for the July 30, 2006, issue of \"The Washington Post\". The article describes how Goldberg conceived yourethemannowdog.com, its rise in popularity, and the elements of a YTMND site. The article also referred to the creators of YTMNDs as \"artists\". Goldberg signed a release for \"The Colbert Report\" to show Stephen Colbert-related YTMNDs. A select few seconds of a YTMND was shown. On November 23, \"The Washington Post\" reported on telemarketing pranks in which they named a number of websites, including howtoprankatelemarketer.ytmnd.com. Various other news reporting sites have printed the same article, including Reuters and \"The Wall Street Journal\". A Swedish newspaper, \"metro\", also included the site in a separate article.\n\n"}
{"id": "4784641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4784641", "title": "İstanbul Archaeology Museums", "text": "İstanbul Archaeology Museums\n\nThe Istanbul Archaeology Museums () is a group of three archeological museums located in the Eminönü district of Istanbul, Turkey, near Gülhane Park and Topkapı Palace.\n\nThe Istanbul Archaeology Museums consists of three museums: \n\nIt houses over one million objects that represent almost all of the eras and civilizations in world history.\n\nIn the 19th century, efforts were in place to modernize the Ottoman Empire, as many of the leading statesmen were exposed to Westernizing ideas through education and travel. The proposal to have an imperial museum came about because of the familiarity of several key players in the Ottoman political scene with the Louvre in Paris. The Ottoman sultan Abdülaziz (r. 1861–1876) was impressed by the archaeological museums in Paris (30 June – 10 July 1867), London (12–23 July 1867) and Vienna (28–30 July 1867) which he visited in the summer of 1867, and ordered a similar archaeological museum to be established in Istanbul. The decision to establish an Imperial Museum under the Education Ministry came in 1869 with the appointment of a new director, but the idea of a museum was dropped with his resignation and because of budget restraints.\n\nAs education minister in 1872, Ahmet Vefik Pasha set up a museum directorship for the second time and hired the German historian, archaeologist, epigraphist and painter, Dr. Phillip Anton Dethier. He proved to be so successful at collecting materials that the idea of a purpose-built museum gained traction.\n\nWhen Dethier died in 1881, painter and archaeologist Osman Hamdi Bey was appointed to the position that same year.\n\nThe site of the museums belonged to the Topkapı Palace outer gardens. The museum was founded by decree as the Imperial Museum ( or ) in 1891. The first curator and founder of the museum was Osman Hamdi Bey. Since an imperial decree protecting cultural goods in the Ottoman Empire was enforced, many governors from the provinces would send in found artefacts to the capital city. In that way the museum was able to amass a great collection. Upon its 100th anniversary in 1991, the museum received the European Council Museum Award, particularly for the renovations made to the lower floor halls in the main building and the new displays in the other buildings.\n\nThe construction of the main building was started by Osman Hamdi Bey in 1881, attaining its present neo-Greek form in 1908. The architect was Alexander Vallaury (who also designed the Pera Palace Hotel in Istanbul). The facade of the building was inspired by the Alexander Sarcophagus and Sarcophagus of the Mourning Women, both housed inside the Museum. It is one of the prominent structures built in the neoclassical style in Istanbul.\n\nThe Museum of the Ancient Orient was commissioned by Osman Hamdi Bey in 1883 as a fine arts school. Then it was reorganised as a museum, which opened in 1935. It was closed to visitors in 1963, and reopened in 1974 after restoration works on the interior.\n\nThe Tiled Kiosk was commissioned by Sultan Mehmed II in 1472. It is one of the oldest structures in Istanbul featuring Ottoman civil architecture, and was a part of the Topkapı Palace outer gardens. It was used as the Imperial Museum between 1875 and 1891 before the collection moved to the newly constructed main building. It was opened to public in 1953 as a museum of Turkish and Islamic art, and was later incorporated into the Istanbul Archaeology Museum.\n\nThe museum is open to the public from 09:00 to 19:00, with ticket sales halting an hour before closing time; tickets are 20 TL. Closed on Mondays.\nThe ornate Alexander Sarcophagus, once believed to be prepared for Alexander the Great, is among the most famous pieces of ancient art in the museum.\n\nThe museum has a large collection of Turkish, Hellenistic and Roman artifacts, many gathered from the vast former territories of the Ottoman Empire. The most prominent artifacts exhibited in the museum include:\n\n\n"}
