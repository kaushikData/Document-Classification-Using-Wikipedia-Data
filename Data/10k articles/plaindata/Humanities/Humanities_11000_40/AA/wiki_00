The complete play was first performed outside in the playing field at Cupar, Fife in June 1552 during the Midsummer holiday, where the action took place under Castle Hill. It was subsequently performed in Edinburgh, also outdoors, in 1554. The full text was first printed in 1602 and extracts were copied into the \"Bannatyne Manuscript\". The \"Satire\" is an attack on the Three Estates represented in the Parliament of Scotland – the clergy, lords and burgh representatives, symbolised by the characters \"Spiritualitie\", \"Temporalitie\" and \"Merchant\". The clergy come in for the strongest criticism. The work portrays the social tensions present at this pivotal moment in Scottish history.\n\nA complete version of the play was printed by Robert Charteris as, \"Ane (Pleasant) Satyre of the Thrie Estaits, in Commendation of Vertew and Vituperation of Vyce\", Edinburgh (1602). In the first part there are 27 different characters. In the second part seven more are added. The key characters are; King Humanity, Divine Correction, Sensuality, Spirituality, Temporality, Gude Counsel and Chastity.\n\nThe play opens with Diligence delivering a sermon on good kingship. The main character, young King Humanity, then appears and is at first led astray by Sensuality and the Vices. His false counsellors introduce him to a mistress, Sensuality, which is the starting point of his disconnection from the moral way of life. He is then fooled by three disguised liars. Gude Counsel is sent to prison by the liars who already have taken control of King Humanitie's mind. With the beginning of his lecherous new life the king forgets about the moral virtues and can no longer judge properly. He consigns Charity and Verity to the stocks. In the course of the following scenes the audience sees how the three so called Vices (Discretion, Devotion and Sapience) try to get rid of everything and everyone who could be dangerous to them. For instance Lady Chastitie, who is homeless since the church in Scotland is not as it was meant to be, begs for shelter from Spiritualitie, Temporalitie and finally the People but is rejected in each case. In the end when Lady Chastitie is sent to prison by the Vices, Divine Correction enters the stage. This is the moment when the vices know that their time has come to an end and they flee and take away the king’s treasure box. Correction frees Gude Counsel, Chastitie and Vertie. He advises the young king to call a parliament and gives him advice regarding a successful reign.\n\nThe second part starts with an interruption. A member of the King's realm, known only as The Poor Man, emerges from the audience, establishes an alliance with John Commonweal to demand reform, and Diligence reappears to announce that the King will seek to improve his realm. Afterwards the Pardoner enters the scene and tries to sell pardoners. Poor Man hears that and buys pardoners worth ‘ane groat’. But Poor Man is not satisfied and gets angry and so they start to argue. In the following scene Diligence opens parliament and King Humanitie, Correction, the king’s courtiers and the virtues enter. The three estates greet the king and parliament is opened. John Commonweal stands up and talks to the King and Correction. He reveals all the failures of the estates. In the course of the following hearing Temporalitie gets punished but as this estate wants to cooperate this is just a short episode. Spiritualitie does not agree on what is said about their estate and fights back. But there are too many accusations against this estate and therefore they also have to give in. The three Vices are imprisoned and sentenced to be hanged. Flatterie tried to get away by betraying his fellows Falsehood and Deceit but this did not work. In the end of the second part the three vices Deceit, Falsehood and Flatterie are allowed to say something before they are hanged. After the execution of the vices and a rousing speech by Folie, Diligence closes the play and advises the audience to go their ways and enjoy their time.\n\nThe 1931 edition of Lindsay's works by Douglas Hamer hypothesized different forms of the play. The critic John MacQueen proposed the play might have composed by Lindsay as early as 1532 for the court of the young James V of Scotland. An early form of the play is recorded in the royal treasurer's accounts and an English agent's report to Thomas Cromwell. This short play or 'interlude' performed in January 1540 used characters who later appeared in the \"Satyre of the Thrie Estaitis\", and had the same themes.\n\nA letter written by the Englishman William Eure to Thomas Cromwell on 26 January 1540 gives a description of the interlude. Eure, a Border Warden and Privy Councillor, had spoken to Sir Thomas Bellenden at Coldstream, who described the performance at Linlithgow Palace before James, his wife Mary of Guise and his bishops and council on the feast of the Epiphany. As the play turned on the Reformation of the church, Eure obtained a more detailed description from a Scottish contact who saw the play at Linlithgow, and enclosed in his letter the synopsis written by his spy . This description corresponds with the expanded later text of Lindsay's play. A king was shown with his courtiers, Placebo, Picthanke, and Flatterye. A Poor Man made his complaint, and was answered by a Burgess, a Man at Arms and a Bishop, who represented the three estates of the Parliament of Scotland. The Poor Man mentioned the real events of James V executing both John Armstrong (of Staplegordon; in ballads the Laird o'Gilnockie), hanged in July 1530, and 'Sym the Laird,' who was hanged in February 1536. The role of the poor man was described in the spy's synopsis;\"After them come a poor Man, who did go up and down the scaffald, making a heavy complaint that he was harried (chased) through the Courtier's place, where through he hade strayled (lost) his house, his wife and children beggyng thair bread, and so of many thousand in Scotland, whiche would make the Kyng's Grace lose of men if his Grace stod neide (required), saying there was no remedy to be gotten, for though he would suite to the King's Grace, he was neither acquainted with Controller nor Treasurer, and without them might no man get no goodness of the King. And after, he spered (asked) for the King, and when he was shewed the Man that was King in the play, he answered and said he was no King, for there was but one King, which made all and governethe all, who is eternal, to whom he and all earthly Kings are but officers, of the which they must make reckoning. And so forth much more to that effect. And then he looked to the King, and said he was not the King of Scotland, for there was another King in Scotland that hanged John Armestrang with his fellowes, and Sym the Larde, and many other more, which had pacified the country, and stanched theft, but he had left one thing undone, which pertained as well to his charge as th'other. And when he was asked what that was, he made a long narration of the oppression of the poor, by the taking of the 'corse presaunte beists' (animals due as tithes at funerals), and of the harrying of poor men by Consistory law, and of many other abussions of the spiritualitie and Churche, with many long stories and authorities.\"\n\nEure said he had talked with Bellenden, a member of the council of James V of Scotland about the possibility of a Reformation of the 'spirituality' in Scotland. The play at Linlithgow had shown the 'naughtiness' of the church. Bellenden said after the play the King spoke to the churchmen in the audience asking them to reform their factions and manner of living, otherwise he would send six of them into England to his uncle, Henry VIII.\n\nThe performance at Cupar on 7 June 1552 was heralded by a short piece called the \"Cupar Banns\" announcing the play, presumably also written by Lindsay. This has three sections of comic drama as a foretaste of the \"Satire\"; the Cotter and his wife, Bessy and the Auld Man, and Fynlaw of the Foot Band, introduced by the 'Nuncius' and linked by the Fool. The characters of the three parts are supposed to be members of the \"Satire's\" audience. The \"Banns\" with some stage directions are found only in the \"Bannatyne Manuscript.\"\n\nSome preparations for the Edinburgh performance on Sunday 14 August 1554 were made by the Burgh Council. William MacDowall with six carpenters built a stage of boards, a seat for Mary of Guise and the French ambassador Henri Cleutin, and a 'Convoy House', at the Greenside playfield, with the gallows, 'jebbettis,' used in the final scene. The town council paid the wages of 12 minstrels, and after the play treated the actors to dinner.\n\nThe printer Henry Charteris mentioned the Edinburgh performance in his introduction to Lindsay's \"Warkis\" (1568), saying how the clergy were surprised by the play and considered taking revenge. Charteris gave this summary of the \"Satire\";\"In the play, playit beside Edinburgh, in the presence of the Quene Regent, and ane greit part of the nobilitie, with ane exceeding greit nowmber of pepill. lestand fra 9 houris afoir none till 6 houris at evin, quhair, amangis mony baith grave materis and merie trickis, he brocht in ane Bischop, ane Persone (Parson), ane Freir, and ane Nun, deckit up in their papisticall ornamentis and maner of raiment. And theirefter broicht in King Correction, quha reformand sindie deformities in his realme, passit to the tryall of the Clergie. And findand thame to be altogether Idiotis, unworthie of ony functioun ecclesiasticall, dicernit thame to be degradit of their dignateis, and spulzeit (deprived) of their offices, quhilk beand executit, thay war fund bot verray fulis, hypocrites, flatteris & nouchtie persones.\"\n\nThe \"Bannatyne Manuscript\" contains only selected \"merry interludes\" from the 1554 Greenside performance, the copyist George Bannatyne omitted the \"grave matter\" because the church had been reformed in reality in the 1560 Scottish Reformation Parliament, and he noted, \"the samyne abuse is weill reformit in Scotland.\" Stage directions in the \"Bannatyne Manuscript\" mention the settings of \"houses\", the \"King's seat\" and \"palyeoun\" tent, and props for the scene of the Poor Man and the Pardoner, \"Heir thay feight togeddir and the puir man sall cast doun the burd and cast the rillickis in the watter.\"\n\nThe play's first complete modern production occurred on August 24, 1948, at the Edinburgh Festival with a modernised text by Robert Kemp and directed by Tyrone Guthrie, featuring Stanley Baxter.\n\nSimon Callow and Fulton Mackay acted in a 1973 Edinburgh Festival production.\nMary McCluskey directed a performance by young people in July 1996 as part of Scottish Youth Theatre's Summer Festival. The script was translated into modern Scots by Fiona McGarry, and the play was performed in the round in The Cottier Theatre, Glasgow, with an original score.\n\nJohn McGrath adapted the play as a contemporary morality \"A Satire of the Four Estaites\", which was presented by Wildcat Theatre Company at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre as part of the Edinburgh International Festival, also in 1996. This production opened on 16 August 1996 and starred Sylvester McCoy.\n\nThe play was quoted at the opening of the new Scottish Parliament, a mark illustrating its importance to modern Scots.\n\nA new performance at Linlithgow Palace and Stirling Castle based on the story of the 1540 interlude took place in 2013 using a cast drawn from stage and screen. In Linlithgow an open-air stage was erected on the Peel looking out across the loch for the performance.\n\nThe \"Satire\" is notable for being one of the earliest recorded instances of \"fuck,\" predating any English language forms but preceded in the Scots language by the makar William Dunbar (Oxford English Dictionary entry.)\n\nA complete version of the play was printed in 1602, see external links for an edition of the text. In this extract Diligence meets the Pauper, who begins his complaint, including the practice of the parish priest claiming livestock at funerals which was mentioned in the 1540 interlude, (Lines 1954-2028);\n\nDILIGENCE:<br>Swyith begger bogill, haist the away,<br>\nThow art over pert to spill our play.\n\nPAUPER:<br>I wil not gif for al ȝour play worth an sowis fart,<br>\nFor thair is richt lytill play at my hungrie hart.\n\nDILIGENCE: Quhat Devill ails this cruckit carle?\n\nPAUPER:<br>Marie Meikill sorrow :<br>\nI can not get, thocht I gasp, to beg, nor to borrow\n\nDILIGENCE: Quhair deuill is this thou dwels or quhats thy intent?\n\nPAUPER: I dwell into Lawthiane ane myle fra Tranent.\n\nDILIGENCE: Quhair wald thou be, carle, the suth to me shaw?\n\nPAUPER: Sir, evin to Sanct-Androes for to seik law.\n\nDILIGENCE: For to seik law in Edinburgh was the neirest way.\n\nPAUPER:<br>Sir I socht law thair this monie deir day;<br>\nBot I culd get nane at sessioun nor Seinȝe :<br>\nThairfoir the mekill dum Deuill droun all the meinȝe.\n\nDILIGENCE:<br>Shaw me thy mater, man, with al the circumstances,<br>\nHow that thou hes happinit on thir vnhappie chances.\n\nPAUPER:<br>Gude-man will ȝe gif me ȝour Charitie,<br>\nAnd I sall declair how the black veritie.<br>\nMy father was ane auld man and ane hoir,<br>\nAnd was of age fourscoir of ȝeirs and moir;<br>\nAnd Mald, my mother was fourscoir and fyfteine :<br>\nAnd with my labour I did thame baith sustein.<br>\nWee had ane Meir, that caryit salt and coill,<br>\nAnd everie ilk ȝeir scho brocht vs hame ane foill.<br>\nWee had thrie ky that was baith fat and fair,<br>\nNane tydier into the toun of Air.<br>\nMy father was sa waik of blude and bane,<br>\nThat he deit, quhairfoir my mother maid great maine.<br>\nThen scho deit within ane day or two ;<br>\nAnd thair began my povertie and wo.<br>\nOur gude gray Meir was baittand on the feild,<br>\nAnd our Lands Laird tuike hir for his hyreild.<br>\nThe Vickar tuik the best Cow be the head,<br>\nIncontinent, quhen my father was deid.<br>\nAnd quhen the Vickar hard tel how that my mother<br>\nWas dead, fra-hand he tuke to him ane vther.<br>\nThen meg my wife did murne both evin & morrow<br>\nTill at the last scho deit for verrie sorow :<br>\nAnd quhen the Vickar hard tell my wyfe was dead,<br>\nThe third cow he cleikit be the head.<br>\nThair vmest clayis, that was of rapploch gray,<br>\nThe Vickar gart his Clark bear them away.<br>\nQuhen all was gaine, I micht mak na debeat,<br>\nBot with my bairns past for till beg my meat.<br>\nNow haue I tald ȝow the black veritie,<br>\nHow I am brocht into this miserie.\n\nDILIGENCE: How did the person, was he not thy gude friend?\n\nPAUPER:<br>The devil stick him, he curst me for my teind,<br>\nAnd halds me ȝit vnder that same proces,<br>\nThat gart me want the Sacrament at Pasche.<br>\nIn gude faith, sir, Thocht he wald cut my throt,<br>\nI haue na geir except ane Inglis grot,<br>\nQuhilk I purpois to gif ane man of law.\n\nDILIGENCE:<br>Thou art the daftest fuill that ever I saw.<br>\nTrows thou, man, be the law to get remeid<br>\nOf men of kirk?

Watkins travelled across Herefordshire as an 'out-rider' representing the family businesses and so got to know the area intimately.\nWatkins was also a respected photographer. He made some cameras himself and manufactured an exposure meter called the 'Watkins Bee Meter' due to its small size and efficiency. An example is in the Museum Resource & Learning Centre, Hereford, and one accompanied Robert Falcon Scott to the South Pole. He was an active member of the Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom and served as its President when the Convention was held in Hereford in 1907. In 1910 he was awarded the Progress Medal of the Royal Photographic Society (RPS). Over 3,000 photographs, taken from Alfred's original glass negative plates are held by Hereford Library and can be viewed on request.\n\nOn 30 June 1921, Watkins visited Blackwardine in Herefordshire when he had the idea that there was a system of straight lines crossing the landscape dating from Neolithic times. He presented his ideas at a meeting of the Woolhope Naturalists' Field Club of Hereford in September 1921, and published his first books \"Early British Trackways\" in 1922 and \"The Old Straight Track\" in 1925. Thereafter he spent a major part of his life developing his theory. He published a further book on leys and participated in the Old Straight Track Club from 1927 to 1935 (the papers from this organisation are also in the Hereford City Museum).\n\nWatkins was a member of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, an authority on beekeeping and a fellow of the Royal Photographic Society. He was also involved in the preservation of Pembridge, Herefordshire Market Hall.\n\nArchaeologists in general do not accept Watkins' ideas on leys. At first they regarded the ancient Britons as too primitive to have devised such an arrangement, but this is no longer the argument used against the existence of leys. More crucially, there are so many ancient features that finding some in approximate alignment is highly likely. Watkins was sensitive to such arguments and argued for caution. He also drew up a list according to which landscape features could be given values between ¼ and 1 point, five points or more being required as evidence of a ley.\n\nWatkins' work resurfaced in popularised form from the 1960s following the publication of John Michell's book \"The View over Atlantis\" in 1969. Michell merged Watkins' ideas with mystical concepts not present in Watkins' own work. In 2004, John Bruno Hare of the Internet Sacred Texts Archive (ISTA) wrote:\n\nIn 2002 Watkins had a beer named after him, \"Watkins' Triumph\", brewed by Wye Valley Brewery Ltd.\n\nAlfred Watkins' Herefordshire in his own words and photographs – publisher – Logaston Press, 14 November 2012.

The museum owns items listed in the Romanian National Cultural Heritage Treasure.\n\nThe Arad Museum Complex was opened in 1893, as an exhibition of Relics of the Revolution from 1848, in the lobby from the 2nd floor of the local State Theatre. Two decades later, in 1913, the museum has been moved into the new built Culture Palace, along with the philharmonic and town library. Besides the old relics exhibition, archeological and medieval history collections were put on display and a European art gallery has been opened as well. In the inter-war period these have been completed with an ethnography exhibition and two memorial rooms dedicated to the local politicians Vasile Goldis and Stefan Cicio-Pop (1934).\n\nAfter the communist overtake, the collections and the exhibitions have been reorganized in the spirit of the new ideology, the section of ancient history, the \"Museum of the Revolution from 1848\" and the art gallery being re-opened in 1954–55 and the ethnography exhibition in 1956.\n\nIn the period 1958–1988 several sections of the museum have been opened in the county: Lipova (Town Museum – 1958), Siria (I. Slavici and E. Montia Memorial Museum – 1960), Savârsin (Art and Ethnography Museum – 1988) and Minis (Vineyard and Vine Museum – 1988).\nAfter a radical reorganisation, which took more than two years, the archaeology and history exhibitions have been reopened in 1979, within the Cultural Palace. The Art Gallery has been moved into its current premises in 1984.\n\nAs a consequence of the political changes from December 1989, the basic exhibitions have been liberated of ideological ballast and in 1992 the a section of natural sciences has been opened, a year later the one of inter-war history as well. The Art Gallery, entirely reorganized, re-opened in 1998. The exhibition \"Arad – December 1989\", came into public circuit in December 2004.\n\nSince 1967, the museum issues its own scientific publication called \"Ziridava\", named after the nearby Dacian settlement mentioned by Ptolemy and archaeologically identified at Pecica. New scientific reviews are being edited since 1992: Studies and Communications of Art and Architecture, Natural Harmonies (1995) – researches from the field of natural sciences – and Zarandul (1999), containing ethnographic studies.\nThe multimedia workshop Kinema Ikon, part of the museum since 1990, issues the interdisciplinary review Intermedia since 1994, being one of Romania’s leading hypermedia art instances, a base on which the workshop represented the country at the 50th Biennial of Contemporary Art in Venice (2003).\n\nToday, the museum manages a collection of over 125.000 pieces, being an active actor on the Arad cultural scene, assuming a reformative role.\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his verse dramas, notably \"The Lady's Not for Burning\", which made him a major force in theatre in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nFry was born as Arthur Hammond Harris in Bristol, the son of Charles John Harris, a master builder who retired early to work full-time as a licensed Lay Reader in the Church of England, and his wife Emma Marguerite Fry Hammond Harris. While still young, he took his mother’s maiden name because, on very tenuous grounds, he believed her to be related to the 19th-century Quaker prison reformer Elizabeth Fry. He adopted Elizabeth Fry's faith, and became a Quaker.\n\nAfter attending Bedford Modern School, where he wrote amateur plays, he became a schoolteacher, working at the Bedford Froebel Kindergarten and Hazelwood School in Limpsfield, Surrey.\n\nIn the 1920s he met the writer Robert Gittings, who became a lifelong friend.\n\nFry gave up his school career in 1932 to found the Tunbridge Wells Repertory Players, which he ran for three years, directing and starring in the English premiere of George Bernard Shaw’s \"A Village Wooing\" in 1934. As a curtain raiser, he put on a revised version of a show he wrote when he was a schoolboy called \"The Peregrines\". He also wrote the music for She Shall Have Music in 1935.\n\nHis play about Dr. Thomas John Barnardo, the founder of children’s homes, toured in a fund-raising amateur production in 1935 and 1936, including Deborah Kerr in its cast.\n\nHis professional career began to take off when he was commissioned by the vicar of Steyning, West Sussex, to write a play celebrating the local saint, Cuthman of Steyning, which became \"The Boy With A Cart\" in 1938. It would be put on professionally in 1950 with the young Richard Burton in his first starring role.\n\nTewkesbury Abbey commissioned his next play, \"The Tower\", written in 1939, which was seen by the poet T. S. Eliot, who became a friend and is often cited as an influence. In 1939 Fry also became artistic director of Oxford Playhouse.\n\nA pacifist, he was a conscientious objector during World War II, and served in the Non-Combatant Corps; for part of the time he cleaned London's sewers.\n\nAfter the War he wrote a comedy, \"A Phoenix Too Frequent\", which was produced at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate, London, in 1946, starring Paul Scofield. The show is a comedy that is based upon Petronius's tale of the Ephesian widow, the false heroics of Dynamene's mourning of her husband in his tomb, and her reawakening to the joy of life by a handsome officer who enters the tomb to rest on a course of duty.\n\n\"The Firstborn\" was produced at the Oxford Playhouse in 1948. The plot is that of Egypt in the throes of a threatening conflict between master and slave, with Moses denouncing his privileges as an Egyptian-reared soldier and finding new responsibility as a leader of his people. The play was produced by actress Katharine Cornell and featured two songs specially written for the play by Leonard Bernstein.\n\nIn 1948 he wrote a commission for the Canterbury Festival, \"Thor, With Angels\".\n\nFry was then commissioned to write a play by Alec Clunes, manager of the Arts Theatre in London. The result, \"The Lady's Not for Burning\", was first performed there in 1948, directed by the actor Jack Hawkins. Due to its success, it transferred to the West End for a nine-month run, starring John Gielgud and featuring Richard Burton and Claire Bloom among the cast. It was presented on Broadway in 1950, again with Burton. The play marked a revival in popularity for poetic drama, most notably espoused by T. S. Eliot. It is the most performed of all his plays and inspired British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to declaim, \"You turn if you want to — the lady’s not for turning,\" at the Conservative Party conference in 1980.\n\nIn 1950 Fry adapted a translation of Jean Anouilh’s \"Invitation to the Castle\" as \"Ring Round the Moon\" for director Peter Brook. He also wrote \"Venus Observed\", which was produced at the St James's Theatre by Laurence Olivier. \"A Sleep Of Prisoners\" followed in 1951, first performed at St Thomas' church in Regent Street, London, in 1951 and later touring with Denholm Elliott and Stanley Baker.\n\n\"The Dark is Light Enough\", a winter play starring Katharine Cornell and Edith Evans in 1954, was third in a quartet of \"seasonal\" plays, featured incidental music written by Leonard Bernstein. The production also featured Tyrone Power, Lorne Greene and Marian Winters. Christopher Plummer had an understudy role that he wrote about in his memoir. This play followed the springtime of \"The Lady’s Not For Burning\" and the autumnal \"Venus Observed\". The quartet was completed in 1970 with \"A Yard Of Sun\", representing summer.\n\nHis next plays were translations from French dramatists: \"The Lark\", an adaptation of Jean Anouilh’s\" L'Alouette (The Lark)\", in 1955; \"Tiger At The Gates\", based on Jean Giraudoux’s \"La guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu\", also in 1955; \"Duel of Angels\", adapted from Giraudoux's \"Pour Lucrèce\", in 1960; and \"Judith\", also by Giraudoux, in 1962.\n\nAlthough Fry lived until 2005, his poetic style of drama began to fall out of fashion with the advent of the Angry Young Men of British theatre in the 1950s. Despite working mainly for the cinema in the 1960s, he continued to write plays, including \"Curtmantle\" for the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962, and \"A Yard of Sun\" – the fourth in his seasonal quartet – at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1970.\n\n\"Curtmantle\"'s (1962) plot deals with Henry II of England and his conflict with Thomas Becket. \"A Yard of Sun\" (1970) is set just after World War II at the time of the famous annual horse race Palio di Siena in the streets of Siena.\n\nAfter the success of his post-war plays Fry bought Trebinshwn, a fine Regency house in Breconshire. When living there he used to walk over the hill behind the house, the Allt, to Llansantffraed church, where the 17th century poet Henry Vaughan is buried, and Vaughan's poetry was a strong influence on him.\n\nDuring the next ten years he concentrated on further translations, including Henrik Ibsen’s \"Peer Gynt\" and Edmond Rostand’s \"Cyrano de Bergerac\" which were produced at the Chichester Festival Theatre.\n\nIn 1986 he wrote \"One Thing More\", a play about the 7th century Northumbrian monk Cædmon who was suddenly given the gift of composing song; it was first performed in Chelmsford Cathedral and then broadcast on the BBC, with further productions in London and Oxford.\n\nHis last play, \"A Ringing Of Bells\", was commissioned by his old school, Bedford Modern School, and performed there in 2000. The following year, a new production was performed at the National Theatre.\n\nIn later life Fry lived in the village of East Dean in West Sussex, and died, from natural causes, in Chichester in 2005. His wife, Phyllis, whom he married in 1936, died in 1987. He was survived by their son, Tam.\n\nRevivals of his plays include a staged reading of \"The Lady's Not For Burning\" at the Royal National Theatre in 2001 as one of the 100 best plays of the 20th century, with actors Alex Jennings, Prunella Scales and Samuel West. West went on to produce \"The Lady’s Not For Burning\" at Chichester Festival Theatre's Minerva Theatre in 2002 with Nancy Carroll and Benjamin Whitrow. In 2007, it was performed in a new production at the Finborough Theatre, London.\n\n\"Ring Round The Moon\" was revived at the Theatre Royal Haymarket 1967-68. starring John Standing and Angela Thorne. In 2008 it was revived again, directed by Sean Mathias, once again starring Angela Thorne, graduating from the role of young Diana to the wheelchair-using Madame Desmortes. Other cast members included JJ Feild, Joanna David, Belinda Lang, John Ramm and Leigh Lawson.\n\nIn commemoration of his achievements, Bedford Modern School named the new Junior School hall after him.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, many of Fry's plays were adapted for the screen, mainly television. One of the most recent was \"The Lady’s Not For Burning\" for Yorkshire TV, starring Kenneth Branagh, in 1987.\n\nIn 1954, he collaborated with John Cannan on a screenplay for a film version of John Gay’s \"The Beggar's Opera\", for director Peter Brook, starring Laurence Olivier. He was also one of the writers of the classic 1959 film, \"Ben-Hur\", directed by William Wyler. But he was uncredited for his efforts on the epic, as was Gore Vidal. The sole writing credit and Academy Award nomination instead went to Karl Tunberg. He collaborated on other screenplays including \"Barabbas\", which starred Anthony Quinn in 1961, and \"\", directed by John Huston, in 1966. Other screenplays include the documentary \"The Queen Is Crowned\" (1953).\n\nHis television movie scripts are \"The Canary\" (1950), \"The Tenant of Wildfell Hall\" (1968), \"The Brontës of Haworth\" (1973), \"The Best of Enemies\" (1976), \"Sister Dora\" (1977), and \"Star Over Bethlehem\" (1981).\n\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\n"}

Frame conservation and restoration includes general cleaning of the frame, as well as in depth processes such as replacing damaged ornamentation, gilding, and toning.\n\nThe purpose of painting frames is two-fold. Frames function to protect and support the artwork as well as to visually enhance the item. Painting frames help us to appreciate and understand its role as it relates to the history of the painting. Original frames are often considered museum objects in their own right. As such, frames are subject to wear and tear in their functional roles as a protective component of the art. Regular activities that require the handling of artwork and their frames, such as exhibition, storage, travel, leave the frame susceptible to damage.\n\nDetermining a frame’s authenticity is important to understanding its relationship with the painting. A frame can be considered original or authentic to a painting if it meets one of several possible requirements. Those requirements are: \n An authentic frame conveys the spirit of the time in which it was made. For the safety of the art, authentic frames can be modified to include glazing and backboards.\n\nFrequent handling, redecoration, modification, atmospheric pollution, and deterioration are some of the many issues that have given cause for conservators to specialize in the preservation of frames. Although wood is the most common material used in the creation of painting frames, other materials such as gesso, glass, plastic, and metal are also used. Each material is susceptible to deterioration and damage.\n\nVices inherent to the material the frame is composed of poses potential risks. The most commonly used material used in the production of frames is wood. Wood is highly susceptible to environmental conditions, as well as infestation from pests and general deterioration. Likewise, metals are susceptible to rust, plastics are susceptible to deformity, and glass is susceptible to breakage. Each of these inherent vices can cause damage to the frame that must be addressed based on the frame's composition.\n\nChanges in humidity and temperature cause major structural damage to frames, such as warping and splitting. This damage makes the frame susceptible to loss of ornamentation from mishandling. In addition, the damage to the frame can endanger the art.\n\n Deterioration of adhesives cause a frame’s joins to split. Animal glues, which were typically used to join a frame together, are susceptible to changes in temperature and humidity, which may cause the adhesives to give due to the warping of the frame. It is also possible that the adhesives themselves might simply deteriorate over time.\n\nDelamination can occur on the surface of a painted or gilded frame. When moisture travels through a crack in the gilded or painted surface, the support is subsequently weakened and the gilded or painted layers begin to lift.\n\nThe industrialization of the 16th to the 18th century has led to increased air pollution in urban areas. Despite being indoors, paintings and their frames were susceptible to the damage from external air pollution.\nOther pollution risks include factors such as light, sneezing, and spillage.\n\nPests thrive off of organic materials such as wood and dust particles. General housekeeping will prevent the accumulation of dirt, dust, and other material that might attract pests. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a non-toxic approach that creates an inhospitable environment for pests.\n\nIn order to best restore a frame to its intended appearance, conservators must blend traditional techniques with modern materials and approaches. The following treatments are common steps in the restoration of a frame:\n\nThe simplest step in treating a frame is dry dusting. Vacuums, sponges, erasers, brushes, and solvent wipes \nare all tools and methods that should be used regularly to prevent dust build up.\n\nTaking an initial assessment of the frame will determine the extent of treatment needed. Below are some of the following steps that may be necessary in the following processes:\n\nIn some cases, the frame may require disassembly. Disassembly can reveal the frame’s construction methods and give the conservator insight to the structural integrity of the frame. Disassembling the frame will also allow the conservator to assess damaged ornamentation and easily replicate necessary elements.\n\nTesting small portions of the frame may be necessary to determine which method is best used to clean the frame. Possible materials used for cleaning include tri-ammonium citrate, Plextol B500, ethyl acrylate, EA, methyl methacrylate, and MMA.\nLost or damaged ornamentation may need to be replaced. It is not uncommon to see ornamentation that has been clumsily re-adhered by past restorations that include unoriginal elements. Depending on the type of ornamentation and the extent of the damage, elements may need to be recarved by a master carver, recast in plaster, or infilled with a reversible gesso One common material used in the recreation of ornamentation is composition, a mixture of animal glue, resin, linseed oil, and venetian turpentine. Once major ornamentation elements have been repaired, it is necessary in a gilded frame to reapply and stabilize the flaking gesso layer with hot rabbit skin glue.\n\n Once major structural treatments have been performed and the gesso layer stabilized, it is necessary to assess the bole layer of the frame. Bole is a mixture of colored clay, glue size, and fat, which is applied on the frame as a base coat for the gilding Typically, the bole layer, which is either red or gray, is revealed in the points of contact of the frame where the gilding has worn off. The color of the bole layer must be closely matched to that of the original bole, as the bole affects the overall tone of the frame.\nIt is essential to determine which gilding process was used before proceeding with the in-gilding process. The two common gilding processes are water gilding and oil gilding. The difference in the two processes is in adhesive coating base. Water gilding is the traditional, more difficult method, which must be cleaned using a mineral spirit or denatured alcohol. Oil gilding can be cleaned with a mild water based soap solution.\n\nOnce the gold leaf has been applied, additional toning will be required to match the original gold. Toning is usually done by creating layers of color made out of animal glue and watercolor paint.\n"}

It consists of a small temple to Tepoztecatl, the Aztec god of the alcoholic beverage \"pulque\".\n\nIn the middle Postclassic Period, various terraces and a small pyramid were built on one of the peaks of the Sierra de Tepoztlan, overlooking the pre-Columbian town of Tepoztlan. The temple became important enough to attract pilgrims from as far away as Guatemala, although the cult of Tepoztecatl was local to this site.\n\nThe temple itself stands at the western side of the site. It consists of a 6.4-meter-high platform supporting a 3.3-meter-high temple base. Upon this stand the remains of the temple building, the remains of which now stand 2.7 meters high. The temple was formed of two rooms. The first room opened onto the temple stairs, with two pillars flanking the entrance. In the centre of this room a small hollow was found, containing traces of charcoal and copal.\n\nThe entry to the small inner sanctum was also flanked by two pillars. The sculpture of Tepoztecatl was probably kept in this room.\n\nThe temple was modified several times during its history. The first consisted of a narrowing of the entrance to the inner sanctum by building flanking walls against the formerly free-standing inner pillars. The second, and most important, modification was the addition of stone benches and a small projecting cornice. On the cornice are bas-reliefs of the glyphs of the 20 days of the sacred tonalpohualli calendar.\n\nDwellings were built on the terraces on the eastern side of the site in order to house the resident priests and their helpers.\n\nIn the ruins of the temple were found two fallen stones with glyphs, one stone bears the name of the eighth Aztec emperor Ahuizotl, the other with the calendrical date \"10 rabbit\". This date represents the year 1502 A.D., the year that this emperor died. From this, some archeologists have concluded that this was the year in which the temple was built, others suggest that these stones were added later to commemorate the death of the Aztec emperor. Some glyphs include a turquoise crown and a shield with arrows, which have led investigators to conclude that the benches were built by the Triple Alliance some time after 1452 A.D., the year when the Alliance conquered Tepoztlan.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17639448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17639448", "title": "Empire of Mind", "text": "Empire of Mind\n\nThe Empire of Mind: Digital Piracy and the Anti-Capitalist Movement is a book by Michael Strangelove first published in 2005. It explores how digital piracy and cultural appropriation within art and popular culture by Internet users influences cultural reproduction within capitalism. It was a Canadian Governor-General’s Award finalist in the category of non-fiction in 2006.\n\nAccording to Strangelove, the economic system known as capitalism promotes unequal class, race and gender relations. Thus capitalism invariably produces resistance. This resistance takes the form of a contest over the meaning of things and events. Structural changes in the architecture of communication lead to new forms and strategies of resistance. \"The Empire of Mind\" identifies characteristics of these structural changes and outlines their implications for resistance to capitalism’s definitional control over meaning.\n\n\"The Empire of Mind\" describes a theory of cultural transmission that takes into account a new structure of communication that is not found in the corporate (commercial) media systems of the pre-Internet era. Within this theory of cultural transmission the notion of an empire of mind is used to describe how capitalism operates as 'a violent and controlling system' (p. 10) that \"tends toward totalization, embracing all before it within its homogenizing logic of social organization\" (p. 12). While Strangelove describes capitalism as having a tendency towards totalization he also argues that such forces as consumer resistance and competition between corporations has ensured that capitalism has never achieved total control over individuals.\n\n\"The Empire of Mind\" includes an analysis of culture jamming which provides an example of how Internet-based cultural production subverts dominant symbolic economies and ideologies and paves the way for the emergence of new symbolic economies (belief systems). Culture jamming is presented as one example of the Internet audience's tendency to subvert privately owned meanings. Strangelove makes no claims about the overall potency or potential of culture jamming. Neither does he claim that the Internet heralds the envitable destruction of capitalism. While Strangelove does argue that the Internet is part of a new symbolic economy he makes no predictions as to the future state (dystopic or utopic) of capitalism's belief system.\n\nStrangelove provides a scholarly definition of the term empire of mind and applies it within an analysis of new and old media. Given the premise that capitalism operates as a meaning-production system that exercises substantial control over our cultures and minds—an empire of mind --- the Internet is seen as subverting the dominant flow of meaning within capitalism's symbolic empire.\n\nThe notion of an \"empire of mind\" (usually seen expressed as an \"empire of \"the\" mind\") has been found in literature since Alexis De Tocqueville first used it in the following oft quoted passage: \nI consider the people of the United States as that portion of the English people which is commissioned to explore the wilds of the New World; whilst the rest of the nation, enjoying more leisure and less harassed by the drudgery of life, may devote its energies to thought, and enlarge in all directions the empire of the mind. The position of the Americans is therefore quite exceptional, and it may be believed that no democratic people will ever be placed in a similar one.\n\nThe phrase an \"empire of \"the\" mind\" usually denotes imperialism or a specific empire and has been applied to the United States, Britain, India, Iran and ancient Greece. Strangelove's use of the phrase was inspired by Sir Winston Churchill's statement, \"The empires of the future are the empires of the mind.\"\n\nHoward A. Doughty writes that Strangelove \"seems to have achieved a position of sensible moderation, an attitude toward the driving force of postmodern culture that allows it to be redeemed, rather than replaced. He embraces the liberal virtues of humanistic reformism. While supporting an attack on authoritarianism, sexism and fast food through new communications techniques, he avoids the logocentrism and the allegedly false promises of nineteenth and twentieth-century revolutionary thinkers.\"\n\nAccording to Christopher Moore, Strangelove \"believes the fundamental empire today is capitalism’s. It operates, he argues, not just through state systems and the marketplace, but by propagating an empire of the mind that takes capitalism for granted. Capitalism is a meaning-production system, he declares ... The goal of capitalism’s empire is the commodification of everything.\"\n\nA review of this book by Darren Wershler-Henry in the \"Canadian Journal of Communication\" states, \"There is also an inconsistency between Strangelove’s criteria for a useful model of the Internet and that for his model of capitalism. \"Within critical theory,\" writes Strangelove, \"philosophical and economic enquiry tends to recreate the Internet in the image of the twentieth century\" (p. 98). Fair enough, but why does Strangelove rely on a model of capitalism that is every bit as dated?\"\n\nA review of this book by Tarleton Gillespie in \"New Media and Society\" notes that \"Strangelove is working very much from within a Marxist, critical theory of communication and society\" and questions Strangelove's claim that \"the file-trading of commercial music and film, which he sees as a widespread disregard for the principle of property, is not an aberration, but is in fact the resting state of the Internet.\"\n\nA review in \"Canadian Literature: A Quarterly of Criticism and Review\", by Michael Truscello, notes that Strangelove \"is quick to point out, repeatedly, that he is not projecting utopian ends for Internet communication; rather, his \"concern\" is with what he calls \"embryonic dynamics,\" emergent possibilities that may not realize a transformation of the social order for some time. In essence, \"by simply allowing all voices a forum, the Internet subverts the hegemonic construction of reality.\" Hegemonic appeals are unsustainable in an environment of \"unconstrained communicative action,\" he suggests, and this is \"the heart of the Internet's most probable long-term social effect.\"\n\nA review in \"The Communication Review\" by Scott Uzelman notes that the \"empire of mind\" as defined by Strangelove \"standardizes beliefs and wants that are \"engineered\" or \"programmed\" by capitalism and \"constructed through the corporate media which acts as a propaganda tool for the elite.\"\" Yet the reviewer contends that \"'capitalism is not reducible to a belief system\".\n\nA review in \"Politics and Culture\", by Alex Kashnabish, describes \"The Empire of Mind\" as a book that \"challenges the prevailing assumptions surrounding the Internet and its possibilities\". Kashnabish writes that this book \"is at its strongest and most convincing when taking up the analysis of the Internet and its relationship to capitalism’s symbolic economy as well as in regards to the significant – if not insurmountable – challenges involved in enclosing the Internet and turning it into fully corporatized space. In both these respects, Strangelove’s argument is nuanced and persuasive.\" The reviewer suggests that Strangelove overstates the potential of culture jamming.\n\n"}

Sw-En translation: \"sharpening grooves\") carved into rock in many places in Europe, and some of them appear on the Baltic Sea island of Gotland. They are common in France, where they were used to polish stone axes.\n\nIn Sweden, there are also grooves in north-western Scania and Halland. In Gantofta located south of Helsingborg a face of sandstone rock is engraved with thousands of grooves. Local tradition says they were made as whetstones.\n\nGrooves in France date from the Neolithic and are called \"polissoirs\". Those in l’Aube date from c. 2500 to 2000 BCE. People who built dolmens, erected menhirs and made grooves supported an archaeological culture known as Seine-Oise-Marne. The l’Aube district had more than 130 monuments from this period including 49 grooves before 1927. Today there are only 34 including 16 grooves. Many stones were cut into roadstones or building blocks for homes.\n\nGrooves have also been found in Tavastia in Finland and in Luxembourg, as well as at Fyfield Down in England.\n\nNeolithic Grooves have been found in Tamil Nadu, India.\n\n3,600 grooves have been discovered on Gotland, of which 700 are in limestone outcrops, while the remainder are on c. 800 boulders and slabs. The grooves are long, c. deep and c. wide.\n\nThe grooves began to attract scholarly attention in the 1850s. At first they were called \"sharpening stones\", but later they received the name \"sword sharpening stones\". After some time, newspapers and scholarly publications began to dispute this, since the shape of the grooves makes them unfit for sharpening swords. Another reason was that by 1933, more than 500 sites with grooves had been identified on Gotland. They were evenly distributed across the island. It was also noted that they ran in different directions and often crossed each other.\n\nThe dates and function of the grooves on Gotland have seen debate in recent decades between archaeologists who argue for a High Medieval date and some industrial function, and proponents of an alternative theory who argue for a Neolithic date and a ritual calendar function. The latter support their view mainly with the idea that the direction of each groove might be given an astronomical interpretation, where each groove would mark a sightline towards a certain celestial phenomenon that may be reconstructed for a certain year during the Stone Age. The grooves under overhangs in Scania cannot have been used as sightlines in this suggested manner.\n\nCertain late 1st-millennium picture stones on Gotland carry grooves that have been made after the relief of the stones was carved, which show the grooves to be late. Likewise with the level above current sea surface of the lowest grooved outcrops on the island, that shows them to be no older than AD 1000 judging from post-glacial shoreline displacement. It has been suggested that on one picture stone, part of the Late Iron Age decoration is carved into the bottom of a groove, meaning that this groove must be older than the picture.\n"}

In the 1980s, home cinemas typically consisted of a movie pre-recorded on a LaserDisc or VHS tape; a LaserDisc or VHS player; and a heavy, bulky large-screen cathode ray tube TV set. In the 2000s, technological innovations in sound systems, video player equipment and TV screens and video projectors have changed the equipment used in home theatre set-ups and enabled home users to experience a higher-resolution screen image, improved sound quality and components that offer users more options (e.g., many of the more expensive Blu-ray players in 2016 can also \"stream\" movies and TV shows over the Internet using subscription services such as Netflix). The development of Internet-based subscription services means that 2016-era home theatre users do not have to commute to a video rental store as was common in the 1980s and 1990s (nevertheless, some movie enthusiasts buy DVD or Blu-ray discs of their favourite content).\n\nToday, a home cinema system typically uses a large projected image from a video projector or a large flat-screen high-resolution HDTV system, a movie or other video content on a DVD or high-resolution Blu-ray disc, which is played on a DVD player or Blu-ray player, with the audio augmented with a multi-channel power amplifier and anywhere from two speakers and a stereo power amp (for stereo sound) to a 5.1 channel amplifier and five or more surround sound speaker cabinets (with a surround sound system). Whether home cinema enthusiasts have a stereo set-up or a 5.1 channel surround system, they typically use at least one low-frequency subwoofer speaker cabinet to amplify low-frequency effects from movie soundtracks and reproduce the deep pitches from the musical soundtrack.\n\nIn the 1950s, playing home movies became popular in the United States with middle class and upper-class families as Kodak 8 mm film projector equipment became more affordable. The development of multi-channel audio systems and later LaserDisc in the 1980s created a new paradigm for home video, as it enabled movie enthusiasts to add better sound and images to their setup. In the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, a typical home cinema in the United States would have a LaserDisc or VHS player playing a movie, with the signal fed to a large rear-projection television set. Some people used expensive front projectors in a darkened viewing room. During the 1990s, watching movies on VHS at home became a popular leisure activity. Beginning in the late 1990s, and continuing throughout much of the 2000s, home-theater technology progressed with the development of the DVD-Video format (higher resolution than VHS), Dolby Digital 5.1-channel audio (\"surround sound\") speaker systems, and high-definition television (HDTV), which initially included bulky, heavy Cathode Ray Tube HDTVs and flat screen TVs. In the 2010s, affordable large HDTV flatscreen TVs, high resolution video projectors (e.g., DLP), 3D television technology and the high resolution Blu-ray Disc (1080p) have ushered in a new era of home theater.\n\nIn the 2000s, the term \"home cinema\" encompasses a range of systems meant for movie playback at home. The most basic and economical system could be a DVD player, a standard definition (SD) large-screen television with at least a 27-inch (69 cm) diagonal screen size, and an inexpensive \"home theater in a box\" surround sound amplifier/speaker system with a subwoofer. A more expensive home cinema set-up might include a Blu-ray disc player, home theater PC (HTPC) computer or digital media receiver streaming devices with a 10-foot user interface, a high-definition video projector and projection screen with over diagonal screen size (or a large flatscreen HDTV), and a several-hundred-watt home theater receiver with five to eleven surround-sound speakers plus one or two powerful subwoofer(s). 3D-TV-enabled home theaters make use of 3D TV sets/projectors and Blu-ray 3D players in which the viewers wear 3D-glasses, enabling them to see 3D content.\n\nHome theater designs and layouts are a personal choice and the type of home cinema a user can set up depends on her/his budget and the space which is available within the home. The minimum set of requirements for a home theater are: a large television set or good quality video projector CRT (no new models sold in U.S.), LCD, Digital Light Processing (DLP), plasma display, organic light-emitting diode (OLED), Silicon X-tal Reflective Display (SXRD), Laser TV, rear-projection TV, video projector, Standard-definition television (SDTV), HDTV, or 3D-TV at least 27 inches (69 cm) measured diagonally, an AV receiver or pre-amplifier (surround processor) and amplifier combination capable of at least stereo sound but preferably 5.1 Channel Dolby Digital and DTS audio, and something that plays or broadcasts movies in at least stereo sound such as a VHS HI-FI VCR, LaserDisc player (no new stand-alone models of either are available; VHS VCRs are usually bundled in combo decks with DVD players), a DVD player, a Blu-ray disc player, cable or satellite receiver, video game console, etc. Finally a set of speakers, at least two, are needed but more common are anywhere from six to eight with a subwoofer for bass or low-frequency effects.\n\nThe most-expensive home-theater set-ups, which can cost over $100,000 (US), and which are in the homes of executives, celebrities and high-earning professionals, have expensive, large, high-resolution digital projectors and projection screens, and maybe even custom-built screening rooms which include cinema-style chairs and audiophile-grade sound equipment designed to mimic (or sometimes even exceed) commercial theater performance.\n\nIn the 2010s, many home cinema enthusiasts aim to replicate, to the degree that is possible, the \"movie theatre experience\". To do so, many home cinema buffs purchase higher quality components than used for everyday television viewing on a relatively small TV with only built-in speakers. A typical home theater includes the following components:\n\nHome cinemas can either be set up by purchasing individual components one by one (e.g., buying a multichannel amp from one manufacturer, a Blu-ray player from another manufacturer, speakers from another company, etc.) or a by purchasing a HTIB (Home Theater in a Box) package which includes all of components from a single manufacturer, with the exception of a TV or projector. HTIB systems typically include a DVD or Blu-ray player, a surround sound amplifier, five surround speakers, a subwoofer cabinet, cables and a remote. The benefit of purchasing separate components one by one is that consumers can attain improved quality in video or audio and better matching between the components and the needs of a specific room, or the consumer's needs.\n\nHowever, to buy individual components, a consumer must have knowledge of sound system and video system design and electronics and she or he must do research on the specifications of each component. For instance, some speakers perform better in smaller rooms while others perform better in larger rooms and seating location must be considered. One of the challenges with buying all the components separately is that the purchaser must understand speaker impedance, power handling, and HDMI compatibility and cabling. Given these challenges, HTIB systems are a simpler and more cost-effective solution for many families and consumers; they are also better suited to smaller living spaces in semi-detached homes or apartments/condos where noise could be an issue. As well, buying an HTIB package is often less expensive than buying separate components.\n\nSome home cinema enthusiasts build a dedicated room in their home for the theater. These more advanced installations often include sophisticated acoustic design elements, including \"room-in-a-room\" construction that isolates sound and provides an improved listening environment and a large screen, often using a high definition projector. These installations are often designated as \"screening rooms\" to differentiate them from simpler, less-expensive installations. In some movie enthusiast's home cinemas, this idea can go as far as completely recreating an actual small-scale cinema, with a projector enclosed in its own projection booth, specialized furniture, curtains in front of the projection screen, movie posters, or a popcorn or vending machine with snack food and candy. More commonly, real dedicated home theaters pursue this to a lesser degree.\n\nAs of 2016, the days of the $100,000 and over home theater system is being usurped by the rapid advances in digital audio and video technologies, which has spurred a rapid drop in prices, making a home cinema set-up more affordable than ever before. This in turn has brought the true digital home theater experience to the doorsteps of the do-it-yourselfers, often for much less than the price of a low-budget economy car. As of 2016, consumer grade A/V equipment can meet some of the standards of a small modern commercial theater (e.g., THX sound).\n\nHome theater seating consists of chairs or sofas specifically engineered and designed for viewing movies in a home theater. Some home theater seats have a cup holder built into the chairs' armrests and a shared armrest between each seat. Some seating has movie-theater-style chairs like those seen in a movie cinema, which feature a flip-up seat cushion. Other seating systems have plush leather reclining lounger types, with flip-out footrests. Available features include storage compartments, snack trays, tactile transducers for low-frequency effects that can be felt through a chair (without creating high volume levels which could disturb other family members), and electric motors to adjust the chair. Home theater seating tends to be more comfortable than seats in a public cinema.\n\nIn homes that have an adequately sized backyard, it is possible for people to set up a home theater in an outdoor area. Depending on the space available, it may simply be a temporary version with foldable screen, a video projector and couple of speakers, or a permanent fixture with a huge screen and dedicated audio set-up mounted in a weather-proof cabinet. Outdoor home cinemas are popular with BBQ parties and pool parties. Some specialist outdoor home-cinema companies are now marketing packages with inflatable movie screens and purpose-built AV systems. Some people have expanded the idea and constructed mobile drive-in theaters that can play movies in public open spaces. Usually, these require a powerful projector, a laptop or DVD player, outdoor speakers or an FM transmitter to broadcast the audio to other car radios.\n\nIn the 1950s, home movies became popular in the United States and elsewhere as Kodak 8 mm film (Pathé 9.5 mm in France) and camera and projector equipment became affordable. Projected with a small, portable movie projector onto a portable screen, often without sound, this system became the first practical home theater. They were generally used to show home movies of family travels and celebrations, but they also doubled as a means of showing some commercial films, or even private stag films. Dedicated home cinemas were called \"screening rooms\" at the time and were outfitted with 16 mm or even 35 mm projectors for showing commercial films. These were found almost exclusively in the homes of the very wealthy, especially those in the movie industry.\n\nPortable home cinemas improved over time with color film, Kodak Super 8 mm film cartridges, and monaural sound but remained awkward and somewhat expensive. The rise of home video in the late 1970s almost completely killed the consumer market for 8 mm film cameras and projectors, as VCRs connected to ordinary televisions provided a simpler and more flexible substitute.\n\nThe development of multi-channel audio systems and LaserDisc in the 1980s added new dimensions for home cinema. The first-known home cinema system was designed, built and installed by Steve J. LaFontaine as a sales tool at Kirshmans furniture store in Metairie, Louisiana in 1974. He built a special sound room which incorporated the earliest quadraphonic audio systems, and he modified Sony Trinitron televisions for projecting the image. Many systems were sold in the New Orleans area in the ensuing years before the first public demonstration of this integration occurred in 1982 at the Summer Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Illinois. Peter Tribeman of NAD (U.S.) organized and presented a demonstration made possible by the collaborative effort of NAD, Proton, ADS, Lucasfilm and Dolby Labs, who contributed their technologies to demonstrate what a home cinema would \"look and sound\" like.\n\nOver the course of three days, retailers, manufacturers, and members of the consumer electronics press were exposed to the first \"home-like\" experience of combining a high-quality video source with multi-channel surround sound. That one demonstration is credited with being the impetus for developing what is now a multibillion-dollar business.\n\nIn the early to mid-1990s, a typical home cinema would have a LaserDisc or VHS player fed to a large screen: rear projection for the more-affordable setups, and LCD or CRT front-projection in the more-elaborate systems. In the late 1990s, a new wave of home-cinema interest was sparked by the development of DVD-Video, Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1-channel audio, and high-quality front video projectors that provide a cinema experience at a price that rivals a big-screen HDTV.\n\nIn the 2000s, developments such as high-definition video, Blu-ray disc (as well as the now-obsolete HD DVD format, which lost the format war to Blu-ray) and newer high-definition 3D display technologies enabled people to enjoy a cinematic feeling in their own home at a more-affordable price. Newer lossless audio from Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD High Resolution Audio and DTS-HD Master Audio and speaker systems with more audio channels (such as 6.1, 7.1, 9.1, 9.2, 10.2, and 22.2) were also introduced for a more cinematic feeling.\n\nBy the mid-2010s, the Blu-ray Disc medium had become a common home media standard, and online video streaming sources such as Netflix and YouTube were offering a range of high definition content, including some 4K content (although various compression technologies are applied to make this streamed content feasible). The first 4K Blu-ray discs were released in 2016. By this point, 4K TVs and computer monitors were rapidly declining in price and increasing in prevalence, despite a lack of native 4K content. While many DSP systems existed, DTS-HD Master Audio remained the studio standard for lossless surround sound encoding on Blu-ray, with five or seven native discrete channels. High definition video projectors also continued to improve and decrease in price, relative to performance.\n\nAs a result of continuing price reductions, large (up to 80<nowiki>\"</nowiki>) TVs became a financially competitive alternative to video projectors in living room or even smaller dedicated room setups. Technologies such as local dimming and the like improved the black levels of LCD screens making them more suitable for use in a dark room. Consumer-grade OLED TVs measuring 55<nowiki>\"</nowiki> and above began to emerge in the second half of the decade. These had even better black levels. However, as of 2018, video projectors remained the only viable option when screen sizes much over 80<nowiki>\"</nowiki> are needed.\n\nNoise Criteria (NC) are noise-level guidelines applicable to cinema and home cinema. For this application, it is a measure of a room's ambient noise level at various frequencies. For example, in order for a theater to be THX certified, it must have an ambient sound level of NC-30 or less. This helps to retain the dynamic range of the system. Some NC levels are:\n\n\nProjectors used for home cinemas have a set of recommended criteria:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15169", "title": "Impressionism", "text": "Impressionism\n\nImpressionism is a 19th-century art movement characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open composition, emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of \"movement\" as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent exhibitions brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nThe Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a Claude Monet work, \"Impression, soleil levant\" (\"Impression, Sunrise\"), which provoked the critic Louis Leroy to coin the term in a satirical review published in the Parisian newspaper \"Le Charivari\".\n\nThe development of Impressionism in the visual arts was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as impressionist music and impressionist literature.\n\nRadicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as Eugène Delacroix and J. M. W. Turner. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, still lifes and portraits as well as landscapes were usually painted in a studio. The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or \"en plein air\". They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short \"broken\" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour—not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary—to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.\n\nImpressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the Macchiaioli, and Winslow Homer in the United States, were also exploring \"plein-air\" painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.\n\nThe public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style. By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including Neo-Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism.\n\nIn the middle of the 19th century—a time of change, as Emperor Napoleon III rebuilt Paris and waged war—the Académie des Beaux-Arts dominated French art. The Académie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Académie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work. Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.\n\nThe Académie had an annual, juried art show, the Salon de Paris, and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Académie, represented by the works of such artists as Jean-Léon Gérôme and Alexandre Cabanel.\n\nIn the early 1860s, four young painters—Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Frédéric Bazille—met while studying under the academic artist Charles Gleyre. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom. By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the Realism of Gustave Courbet and the Barbizon school. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the Café Guerbois on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by Édouard Manet, whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne, and Armand Guillaumin.\nDuring the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style. In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's \"The Luncheon on the Grass\" \"(Le déjeuner sur l'herbe)\" primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting. The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.\n\nAfter Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the Salon des Refusés (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refusés drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.\n\nArtists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refusés in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In December 1873, Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Cézanne, Berthe Morisot, Edgar Degas and several other artists founded the \"Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs\" (\"Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\") to exhibit their artworks independently. Members of the association were expected to forswear participation in the Salon. The organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older Eugène Boudin, whose example had first persuaded Monet to adopt \"plein air\" painting years before. Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, Johan Jongkind, declined to participate, as did Édouard Manet. In total, thirty artists participated in their first exhibition, held in April 1874 at the studio of the photographer Nadar.\nThe critical response was mixed. Monet and Cézanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist Louis Leroy wrote a scathing review in the newspaper \"Le Charivari\" in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's \"Impression, Sunrise\" \"(Impression, soleil levant)\", he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article \"\", Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.\n\nHe wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,\n\nThe term \"Impressionist\" quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together—albeit with shifting membership—eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.\n\nMonet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the \"purest\" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors. Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. Édouard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader, never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting \"Spanish Singer\" had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that \"the Salon is the real field of battle\" where a reputation could be made.\nAmong the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870), defections occurred as Cézanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and Cézanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy. Degas invited Mary Cassatt to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of Jean-François Raffaëlli, Ludovic Lepic, and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of \"opening doors to first-come daubers\". The group divided over invitations to Paul Signac and Georges Seurat to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.\n\nThe individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, Durand-Ruel, played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley died in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879. Monet became secure financially during the early 1880s and so did Pissarro by the early 1890s. By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.\n\nFrench painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the Romantic colourist Eugène Delacroix, the leader of the realists Gustave Courbet, and painters of the Barbizon school such as Théodore Rousseau. The Impressionists learned much from the work of Johan Barthold Jongkind, Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and Eugène Boudin, who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.\n\nA number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists—and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as Frans Hals, Diego Velázquez, Peter Paul Rubens, John Constable, and J. M. W. Turner—the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:\n\n\nNew technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors. Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.\n\nMany vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These included cobalt blue, viridian, cadmium yellow, and synthetic ultramarine blue, all of which were in use by the 1840s, before Impressionism. The Impressionists' manner of painting made bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as cerulean blue, which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.\n\nThe Impressionists' progress toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground. By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the finished painting. By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting.\n\nPrior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such 17th-century Dutch painters as Jan Steen, had emphasized common subjects, but their methods of composition were traditional. They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention. The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance. Photography was gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of people.\nThe development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and landscape paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography \"produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably\".\n\nIn spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused \"on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph—by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated\". The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their \"tacit imperatives of taste and conscience\". Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: \"The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph\".\n\nAnother major influence was Japanese ukiyo-e art prints (Japonism). The art of these prints contributed significantly to the \"snapshot\" angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of Impressionism. An example is Monet's \"Jardin à Sainte-Adresse\", 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints\n\nEdgar Degas was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints. His \"The Dance Class\" \"(La classe de danse)\" of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant. He also captured his dancers in sculpture, such as the \"Little Dancer of Fourteen Years\".\n\nThe central figures in the development of Impressionism in France, listed alphabetically, were:\n\nAmong the close associates of the Impressionists were several painters who adopted their methods to some degree. These include Jean-Louis Forain (who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1879, 1880, 1881 and 1886) and Giuseppe De Nittis, an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work. Federico Zandomeneghi was another Italian friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists. Eva Gonzalès was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. James Abbott McNeill Whistler was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. Walter Sickert, an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer Wynford Dewhurst wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, \"Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development\", which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.\n\nBy the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as Jean Béraud and Henri Gervex found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art. Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.\n\nThe influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like J.D. Kirszenbaum were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.\n\nAs the influence of Impressionism spread beyond France, artists, too numerous to list, became identified as practitioners of the new style. Some of the more important examples are:\n\nThe sculptor Auguste Rodin is sometimes called an Impressionist for the way he used roughly modeled surfaces to suggest transient light effects.\n\nPictorialist photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called Impressionists.\n\nFrench Impressionist Cinema is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919–1929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include Abel Gance, Jean Epstein, Germaine Dulac, Marcel L’Herbier, Louis Delluc, and Dmitry Kirsanoff.\n\nMusical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in European classical music that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the Romantic era. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the nocturne, arabesque, and prelude, and often explored uncommon scales such as the whole tone scale. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.\n\nThe influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. Erik Satie was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. Paul Dukas is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as Ottorino Respighi (Italy) Ralph Vaughan Williams, Cyril Scott, and John Ireland (England), and Manuel De Falla, and Isaac Albeniz (Spain).\n\nThe term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to Symbolism, with its major exemplars being Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Rimbaud, and Verlaine. Authors such as Virginia Woolf, D.H. Lawrence, and Joseph Conrad have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life.\n\nPost-Impressionism developed from Impressionism. During the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat, and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; Camille Pissarro briefly painted in a pointillist manner, and even Monet abandoned strict \"plein air\" painting. Paul Cézanne, who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.\n\n"}

His father completed two tours with the U.S. military in France (a total of seven years) and one 18-month stay at Kagnew Station in Asmara, Eritrea (then Ethiopia). (Cole reports that he first became interested in Islam in Eritrea, which has a population roughly half Christian and half Muslim.)

For two quarters in his senior year he conducted a research project in Beirut, Lebanon and returned to the city as a graduate student in the fall of 1975, but the civil war prevented Cole from continuing his studies there. Therefore, he pursued a master's degree at the American University in Cairo in Islamic and Middle Eastern studies, graduating in 1978. Cole then returned to Beirut for another year and worked as a translator for a newspaper. In 1979 Cole enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles as a doctoral student in the field of Islamic Studies, graduating in 1984. After graduation, Cole was appointed Assistant Professor of History at the University of Michigan where he became a full professor in 1995.\n\nCole was from a mixed Catholic and Protestant heritage but was brought up a non-denominational Protestant on army bases. In the late 1960s and the 1970s he became interested in Eastern religions, including Buddhism. Cole became a member of the Bahá'í Faith in 1972 as an undergraduate at Northwestern, and the religion later became a focus of his academic research. He resigned from the faith in 1996 after disputes with Bahá'í leadership concerning the Bahá'í system of administration, particularly the requirement to review works by Bahá'í authors when writing about the religion. He later became uninterested in organized religion as a personal matter.\n\nCole married Shahin Malik in Lahore in 1982. The couple has a son, Arman, born in 1987.\n\nCole was awarded Fulbright-Hays fellowships to India (1982) and to Egypt (1985–1986). In 1991 he held a National Endowment for the Humanities grant for the study of Shia Islam in Iran. From 1999 until 2004, Juan Cole was the editor of \"The International Journal of Middle East Studies\". He has served in professional offices for the American Institute of Iranian Studies and on the editorial board of the journal \"Iranian Studies\". He is a member of the Middle East Studies Association of North America, and served as the organization's president for 2006. In 2006, he received the James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism administered by Hunter College.\n\n\nCole became interested in Islam and Arabic while a teenager living in Eritrea when his father was stationed there. He studied Arabic at Northwestern University, in Beirut, at the American University in Cairo, and at the University of California, Los Angeles; his study included classical historical, theological and philosophical texts and classical and modern literature. He speaks Arabic (Modern Standard as well as Lebanese and Egyptian dialects), Persian, and Urdu, and can read Ottoman Turkish. He also knows French, German and Spanish.\n\nAmong Cole's major academic specializations has been the history of modern Egypt, including Sunni Islam. His second monograph was on the nineteenth-century 'Urabi Revolt, and his fifth was on the French invasion and occupation of the country under Napoleon. Egypt was one focus of his \"Engaging the Muslim World\" (Palgrave, 2009). He has authored nearly a dozen major journal articles and book chapters on Egypt.\n\nModern Shia Islam has been a major preoccupation in Cole's scholarship. The Shia Crescent runs from Saudi Arabia to India, and Cole has written on various countries in this arc as well as on Islam in general, the secular history and politics of the region, and comparative studies. His first monograph was on the modern history of Shi'a Islam in North India. His fourth book was a treatment of modern Shi'i movements throughout South and Western Asia. He has published over two dozen journal articles and book chapters on modern Shia Islam.\n\nAfter September 11, 2001, Cole turned increasingly to writing on radical Muslim movements, the Iraq War, United States foreign policy, and the Iran crisis. His scholarship was influenced by his blog, \"Informed Comment\", founded in 2002. He has pioneered in the field of what he calls not \"contemporary history\" but \"current affairs history\". See also \"The Case for Current Affairs History\"\n\nKahlil Gibran is a well-known Lebanese-American poet, essayist, and artist who wrote in Arabic as well as English. Cole has translated three volumes of his Arabic-language literary writings. One of these, \"Broken Wings\" (\"al-Ajnihah al-Mutakassira\", 1912), is alleged to have been the first Arabic-language novel, and has early feminist themes, protesting against arranged marriage and religious corruption.\n\nAfter September 11, Cole founded the Global Americana Institute to translate works concerning the United States into Arabic. The first volume was selected works of Thomas Jefferson, translated for the first time into Arabic, and the second is a translation of a biography of Martin Luther King Jr. along with selected speeches and writings (scheduled for fall 2012). The Institute is partnering with Dar al-Saqi books in this series. Cole has successfully solicited contributions through his website to support the translations and publications.\n\nCole converted to the Bahá'í Faith in 1972, but later resigned in 1996 after conflicts with members of the Bahá'í administration who perceived him as extreme and threatened him with a Bahá'í version of excommunication. Cole went on to critically attack the Bahá'í Faith in several books and articles written from 1998-2000, describing a prominent Bahá'í as \"inquisitor\" and \"bigot\", and describing Bahá'í institutions as socially isolating, dictatorial, and controlling, with financial irregularities and sexual deviance.\n\nSoon after his resignation, Cole created an email list and website called H-Bahai, which became a repository of both primary source material and critical analysis on the religion.\n\nBefore resigning, Cole had several works published through Bahá'í publishers and co-edited an online journal (\"Occasional Papers in the Shaykhi, Babi, and Baha'i Religions,\" associated with H-Bahai). Some of these were translations, including several \"unofficial\" scriptural translations, and two volumes by/about early Bahá'í theologian Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl. He has maintained much of this material, as well as other documents and links, online.\n\nCole has written a great deal of journalism, although much more in the form of commentary than direct news gathering. From 2004 to 2009, Cole had a regular column at \"Salon\". Since 2009, he has written semi-regularly for Truthdig and Tom Engelhardt's Tomdispatch.com.\n\nHe has published op-eds on the Mideast at \"The Washington Post\", \"Le Monde Diplomatique\", \"The Guardian\", the \"San Jose Mercury News\", the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"The Boston Review\", \"The Nation\", the \"Daily Star\", \"Tikkun magazine\"\n\nCole has been a regular guest on \"The NewsHour\" at the PBS, and has appeared widely on television shows such as \"Nightline\", ABC Evening News, the \"Today Show\", \"Anderson Cooper 360°\", \"Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer\", Al Jazeera and CNN Headline News. \"Charlie Rose\", \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\", \"The Rachel Maddow Show\", \"The Colbert Report\", \"Democracy Now!\" and many others.\n\nWith regard to radio, he has also been a frequent guest on National Public Radio and has been interviewed by Ian Masters (KPFK), and has been interviewed by Terry Gross (\"Fresh Air\") and Diane Rehm, among many others.\n\nCole was occasionally cited in the press as a Middle East expert in the 1990s. He became much more prominent after 2002, when he began publishing his weblog.\n\nFrom 2002 onwards, Cole became a widely recognized public intellectual. \"Foreign Policy\" commented in 2004, \"Cole's transformation into a public intellectual embodies many of the dynamics that have heightened the impact of the blogosphere. He wanted to publicize his expertise, and he did so by attracting attention from elite members of the blogosphere. As Cole made waves within the virtual world, others in the real world began to take notice\".\n\nHis focus has primarily been Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Egypt and the Arab Spring. He has also occasionally written or given interviews about Israel and the Palestinians.\n\nSince 2002, Cole has published the blog \"Informed Comment\", covering \"History, Middle East, South Asia, Religious Studies, and the War on Terror\". Blog entries include comments on widely reported articles in Western media, summaries of important articles from Arabic and Israeli news sources, and letters and discussions with both critics and supporters.\n\nThe blog has won various awards; as of April 2006 the most prominent is the 2005 James Aronson Award for Social Justice Journalism from Hunter College. It has also received two 2004 Koufax Awards: the \"Best Expert Blog\" and the \"Best Blog Post\". It has since dropped off the list, but \"Informed Comment\" has been ranked as the 99th most popular blog on the Internet by Technorati on October 21, 2006. Cole was a strong critic of the George W. Bush administration and is one of the most respected foreign policy commentators amongst left-wing bloggers.\n\nThe July 28, 2006 issue of \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" featured a story on Cole's blog and its role in his career. Following essays by several academic bloggers, Cole was given a chance to respond to the question of whether academics should risk career advancement by blogging. His reply, in part, was:\n\nThe question is whether Web-log commentary helps or damages an academic's career. It is a shameful question. Intellectuals should not be worrying about \"careers\", the tenured among us least of all. Despite the First Amendment, which only really protects one from the government, most Americans who speak out can face sanctions from other institutions in society. Journalists are fired all the time for taking the wrong political stance. That is why most bloggers employed in the private sector are anonymous or started out trying to be so.\n\nIn that same article, he was referred to as a public intellectual by associate professor of culture and communication at New York University Siva Vaidhyanathan.\n\nIn 2004, the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations requested Cole's testimony at hearings to better understand the situation in Iraq.\n\nCole is an avid science fiction fan and has a strong personal interest in human rights issues.\n\nGenerally speaking, Cole approaches the Middle East and Western Asia from the point of view of anti-imperialism. Viewing the USA as a colonialist power, he sees it as defending the post-World War I \"Sykes–Picot/Balfour architecture\" (described as \"a colossal failure\") against Arab nationalist or pan-Islamic challengers. These foundered for various reasons, especially \"particularism\". The U.S., like previous empires, seeks to take advantage of such internal rivalries in order to \"divide and rule\". Terrorism, he explains (after comparing several countries in the region), is the result of foreign occupation in combination with weak states.\n\nCole tends to value multinational (and especially UN) initiatives over unilateral military ones. He favors multi-ethnic states over separatist movements. Given his background in the 1960s and 1970s religious counter-culture, he views Islam (along with other religions) as essentially good, but distorted by certain of its political appropriators (and critics).\n\nCole mastered Persian in the 1970s and 1980s and has written academically on Iran's early modern and modern history, including the Qajar period and the Islamic Republic from 1979.\n\nCole supported the reformist president Mohammad Khatami and rued his succession by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He reports that in 2003, Iran (addressing the Bush administration through the Swiss embassy) proposed a comprehensive peace agreement, which Bush refused even to discuss.\n\nCole viewed the 2009 presidential election as having been stolen by Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nCole wrote numerous posts warning that the Bush administration was attempting to create a war with Iran. He suggested that sabre-rattling offered a way for two unpopular regimes to attract nationalistic support. He has also speculated that the Bush administration's objective in Iran was to control future supplies of oil and natural gas, while denying them to energy-hungry China and India.\n\nOn the nuclear issue, Cole wrote in 2007 that \"Iran is a good ten years away from having a bomb,\" and points out that Ali Khamenei and other leaders have condemned nuclear weapons as un-Islamic. Cole also dismissed the Bush administration's allegation that Iran has supported terrorism in Iraq or Afghanistan, arguing rather that the United States had lent support to anti-Iranian terrorist groups such as the Kurdistan Free Life Party.\n\nCole chastised several U.S. presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton, Rudy Giuliani, and Mitt Romney, for making bellicose statements about Iran in order to present themselves in a tougher or more conservative light.\n\nCole is also a vocal critic of President Ahmadinejad. He has written that \"I profoundly disagree with his characterization of Israel, which is a legitimate United Nations member state\". He also considers Ahmadinejad's holocaust denial to be \"monstrous\".\n\nAhmadinejad's remarks on Israel\nCole and Christopher Hitchens have traded barbs regarding the translation and meaning of a passage referring to Israel in a speech by Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Fathi Nazila of \"The New York Times\"'s Tehran bureau translated the passage as \"Our dear Imam [Khomeini] said that the occupying regime must be wiped off the map.\"\n\nIn an article published at the Slate website, Hitchens accused Cole of attempting to minimize and distort the meaning of the speech, which Hitchens understood to be a repetition of \"the standard line\" that \"the state of Israel is illegitimate and must be obliterated.\" Hitchens also denigrated Cole's competence in both Persian and \"plain English\" and described him as a Muslim apologist.\n\nCole responded that while he personally despised \"everything Ahmadinejad stands for, not to mention the odious Khomeini\", he nonetheless objected to the \"New York Times\" translation. Cole wrote that it inaccurately suggested Ahmadinejad was advocating an invasion of Israel (\"that he wants to play Hitler to Israel's Poland\"). He added that a better translation of the phrase would be \"the occupation regime over Jerusalem should vanish from the page of time,\" a metaphysical if not poetic reference rather than a militaristic one. He also stated that Hitchens was incompetent to assess a Persian-to-English translation, and accused him of unethically accessing private Cole e-mails from an on-line discussion group.\n\nCole was asked to address the pros and cons of the building war against Iraq in January 2003 for the journal of the University of Michigan International Institute. He warned that any invasion of Iraq would inevitably be rejected by Iraqis and the Arab world as a form of neocolonialism. He wrote, \"The Sunnis of Iraq could well turn to groups like al-Qaida, having lost the ideals of the Baath. Iraqi Shi'ites might become easier to recruit into Khomeinism of the Iranian sort, and become a bulwark for the shaky regime in Shi'ite Iran.\" Considering the problem of ethnic politics, he said, \"A post-war Iraq may well be riven with factionalism that impedes the development of a well-ensconced new government.\" He rejected the argument that Baathist Iraq's \"weapons of mass destruction\" or backing of terrorism posed threats to the United States. Cole admitted that he had had \"mixed feelings\" on the issue—i.e., he opposed Saddam Hussein's regime, but feared disaster and opposed international illegality. He was insistent that any war would be illegal without a UN Security Council resolution (which was not obtained by the Bush administration). His position on the war resembled that of the French government, which is generally held to have opposed it. By January 2003, he said he had become \"cynical\" about the Bush administration motives for the war. On the day of the U.S. invasion Cole wrote that \"for all the concerns one might have about the aftermath, the removal of Saddam Hussein and the murderous Baath regime from power will be worth the sacrifices that are about to be made on all sides.\" He has explained that this posting was not intended to show support for the invasion: \"The passage quoted ... was not about whether the war was legal or not. Being from a military family, it mattered to me as an ethical issue whether troops lives were being lost for no good reason, in an illegal boondoggle. I decided on careful deliberation that even though the war was wrong, the lives lost would not be in vain, since a tyrannical regime would have fallen. To say that some good could come of an illegal act is not to endorse the illegal act.\"\n\nCole blamed the George W. Bush administration for creating what he calls a \"failed state\" in Iraq. He particularly cites its decision to disband the Iraqi Army, its treatment of prisoners, its alienation of neighboring countries, its corrupt economic policies, and long delays in organizing elections and forming a (weak) government. Bush's decision to invade Iraq, Cole wrote in 2005, resulted from a \"coalition of disparate forces\" within the Bush administration, \"each with its own rationale\" for going to war. He identifies: Bush's own \"obsession with restoring family honor\" slighted by Saddam Hussein's remaining in power after the Gulf War; Dick Cheney's interest in benefits to the oil industry (he cites \"billions in no-bid contracts for [Halliburton]\"—of which Cheney was CEO in the 1990s—and which \"saved Halliburton from bankruptcy\"); Cheney's \"Manichaean, Cold War-inspired worldview—in which the U.S. battled an evil enemy\"; Evangelical Christians who \"wanted to missionize Iraq\"; Karl Rove's wanting to \"turn Bush into a war president\" to ensure re-election; and neo-conservatives who hoped to transform the Middle East and remove what they perceived as a danger to Israel. The Bush administration's focus on purported weapons of mass destruction, he added, was an attempt to find a rationale acceptable to the public.\n\nCole rejects the Bush administrations early claims of Iraqi cooperation with Al-Qaeda, noting that Saddam Hussein had \"persecuted and killed both Sunni and Shiite fundamentalists in great number\", as well as claims to the effect that Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Rather than making America safer, he says, the war has ironically had the opposite effect: inspiring anti-U.S. militants.\n\nCole, who began to call the Iraqi conflict a \"civil war\" as early as 2004, in 2007 stated that it consists of three distinct wars: \"for control of Basra among Shiite militiamen; for control of Baghdad and its hinterlands between Sunnis and Shiites; and for control of Kirkuk among Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen.\"\n\nCole is a strong critic of Israel's foreign and military policy and its treatment of Palestinians. He criticizes the nature of America's support for Israel and the activities of the Israel Lobby, and claims that some senior US officials such as Douglas J. Feith have dual loyalties to America and the Likud party of Israel.\n\nCole opposes boycotts of Israeli academics because he believes that the academic community in Israel is mostly opposed to the policies of the Likud.\n\nCole distinguishes \"traditional\" al-Qaeda from various 4-6 man cells scattered around the world who may identify with its goal, and use the name, but are not otherwise in contact with it. The former group consists of perhaps 5,000 members (\"probably no more than a few hundred of them actually dangerous to the United States\") whose activities \"should be combatted by good police and counter-terrorism work\". According to Cole, the Bush administration's view of \"al-Qaeda\" conflates various unrelated Muslim groups into a \"bogeyman\".\n\nAs of 2006 there were \"less than 1000\" foreign (i.e., genuine) al-Qaeda fighters in Iraq, although the Bush administration's actions have caused increasing numbers of Iraqi Sunnis to sympathize or identify with that organization. Such native sympathizers are referred to on his blog as \"Salafi jihadis\". Cole dismissed as \"implausible\" the prospect of such groups taking over Iraq.\n\nCole calls the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan \"the right war at the right time\", and credits it with breaking up a network of al-Qaeda training camps which posed a danger to the U.S. Cole later criticized Bush for leaving the job half finished in Afghanistan to go off and fight in Iraq.\n\nCole complains that Iraq has displaced Afghanistan from the public consciousness. \"As for money, Iraq has hogged the lion's share,\" he writes. \"What has been spent on reconstruction in Afghanistan is piddling.\" Talk of furthering democracy and women's rights, or eliminating opium poppy cultivation there, has all but evaporated. \"Half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product now comes from poppy sales.\"\n\nCole lived in Beirut for several years, and was present for part of the 1975–1976 civil war. His overview of 20th century Lebanese history blames the CIA for rigging elections there in 1957, in order to allow president Camille Chamoun a second term. (Chamoun had apparently persuaded Dwight D. Eisenhower that the Druze leaned towards Communism.) This had the effect of forcing pro-Nasser Arab nationalists outside the political process. Cole additionally blames the influx of 100,000 Palestinian refugees in 1948—and the various later military actions against them by Syria and Israel—for the condition of Lebanese politics today.\n\nCole often points out the incongruity of the U.S. allying itself with offshoots of the Islamic Dawa Party in Iraq but vehemently opposing Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nDuring the 2006 Lebanon War, Cole accused both sides of committing \"war crimes\" against civilians. Cole stated that \"[Israel has] every right to defend itself against Nasrallah and his mad bombers\" while voicing disapproval for the \"wholesale indiscriminate destruction and slaughter in which the Israelis have been engaged against the Lebanese in general\". Cole also accused Israel of having planned the operation as much as a year in advance, rather than simply responding to provocation.\n\nCole opposed the Pervez Musharraf regime, which he blames for cracking down on democracy activists, while simultaneously allowing Islamists based in Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) to consolidate and expand their political power. He points out that Musharraf is actually a \"hawk\" with respect to India (in contrast to the government of Nawaz Sharif, which had made overtures to it before the coup), and cancelled a special-forces operation aimed at killing Osama bin Laden. (The operation had been urged by President Bill Clinton, and if successful, might have prevented the September 11 attacks.)\n\nCole also censures the George W. Bush administration for not pushing for democratization in Pakistan. Such a development would not threaten U.S. interests, he writes, since whenever elections have been held, Taliban-like movements have not received much support from voters. On the contrary, the danger is that U.S. support for Musharraf may alienate middle-class Pakistanis. Cole is also on the Editorial Board of \"Pakistaniaat\".\n\nCole's wife Shahin received her legal education in Lahore, Pakistan, and has also written against Musharraf's crackdown.\n\nCole supported what he described as \"the UNSC-authorized intervention\" in Libya in 2011 by NATO, and criticized those on the Left who did not. When Cole was asked in 2015 how he felt about the results of the intervention, he said, \"It wasn't an intervention, it was a revolution. Revolutions are messy. It turned out better than Syria, where there wasn't a significant intervention.\"\n\nIn 2011, James Risen reported in \"The New York Times\" that, \"Glenn L. Carle, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who was a top counterterrorism official during the administration of President George W. Bush, said the White House at least twice asked intelligence officials to gather sensitive information\" on Cole \"in order to discredit him\". \"In an interview, Mr. Carle said his supervisor at the National Intelligence Council told him in 2005 that White House officials wanted 'to get' Professor Cole, and made clear that he wanted Mr. Carle to collect information about him, an effort Mr. Carle rebuffed. Months later, Mr. Carle said, he confronted a C.I.A. official after learning of another attempt to collect information about Professor Cole. Mr. Carle said he contended at the time that such actions would have been unlawful.\"\n\nIn 2006 Cole was nominated to teach at Yale University and was approved by both Yale's sociology and history departments. However, the senior appointments committee overruled the departments, and Cole was not appointed.\n\nAccording to \"several Yale faculty members\", the decision to overrule Cole's approval was \"highly unusual\". Yale Deputy Provost Charles Long stated that \"Tenure appointments at Yale are very complicated and they go through several stages, and [the candidates] can fail to pass at any of the stages. Every year, at least one and often more fail at one of these levels, and that happened in this case.\" The history department vote was 13 in favor, seven opposed, and three abstentions. Professors interviewed by the \"Yale Daily News\" said \"the faculty appeared sharply divided.\"\n\nYale historian Paula Hyman commented that the deep divisions in the appointment committee were the primary reasons that Cole was rejected: \"There was also concern, aside from the process, about the nature of his blog and what it would be like to have a very divisive colleague.\" Yale political science professor Steven B. Smith commented, \"It would be very comforting for Cole's supporters to think that this got steamrolled because of his controversial blog opinions. The blog opened people's eyes as to what was going on.\" Another Yale historian, John M. Merriman, said of Cole's rejection: \"In this case, academic integrity clearly has been trumped by politics.\"\n\nIn an interview on \"Democracy Now!\", Cole noted that he had not applied for the Yale job: \"Some people at Yale asked if they could look at me for a senior appointment. I said, 'Look all you want.' So that's up to them. Senior professors are like baseball players. You're being looked at by other teams all the time. If it doesn't result in an offer, then nobody takes it seriously.\" He described the so-called \"scandal\" surrounding his nomination as \"a tempest in a teapot\" that had been exaggerated by \"neo-con journalists\": \"Who knows what their hiring process is like, what things they were looking for?\"\n\nAlexander H. Joffe in the \"Middle East Quarterly\" has written that \"Cole suggests that many Jewish American officials hold dual loyalties, a frequent anti-Semitic theme.\" Cole argues that his critics have \"perverted the word 'antisemitic, and also points out that \"in the Middle East Studies establishment in the United States, I have stood with Israeli colleagues and against any attempt to marginalize them or boycott them\".\n\nAccording to Efraim Karsh, Cole has done \"hardly any independent research on the twentieth-century Middle East\", and characterized Cole's analysis of this era as \"derivative\". He has also responded to Cole's criticism of Israeli policies and the influence of the \"Israel lobby\", comparing them to accusations that have been made in anti-semitic writings. Cole replied directly to Karsh in his blog, dismissing one of Karsh's charges, that Cole's criticisms echo themes in the antisemitic tract \"Protocols of the Elders of Zion.\" Cole also defended his knowledge of modern Middle Eastern history, comparing his experience \"on the ground\" in the modern Arab world favorably with that of Bernard Lewis, a historian he said is \"lionized\" by Karsh.\n\nJeremy Sapienza of \"Antiwar.com\" has criticized Cole for what he deems as partisan bias on issues of war and peace, noting his support for wars supported by the Democratic party such as in the Balkans and Libya while opposing Republican wars such as Iraq.\n\nJohn Walsh and editor/commentator Alexander Cockburn have described Cole as being an advisor to the CIA and Walsh referred to Cole as a \"humanitarian hawk\". In response to Walsh's charges, Cole said that he was never a consultant to the CIA, but did give talks at events sponsored by think tanks at which a range of US government officials were present, including CIA analysts.\n\nDavid North has strongly criticized Cole's defense of the US/NATO Libyan intervention, claiming an inconsistency between Cole's 2006 opposition to the \"wholesale destruction of all of Lebanon by Israel and the US Pentagon\" as part of a broader strategy to acquire control of the major sources of oil and natural gas, and Cole's 2011 statement that \"I haven't seen the war-for-oil argument made for Libya in a manner that makes any sense at all.\"\n\n\nReference:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3428728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3428728", "title": "Kokino", "text": "Kokino\n\nKokino () is a Bronze Age archaeological site in the Republic of Macedonia, approximately 30 km from the town of Kumanovo, and about 6 km from the Serbian border, in the Staro Nagoričane municipality. It is situated between about 1010 and 1030 m above sea level on the Tatićev Kamen (Татиќев камен) summit and covers an area of about 90 by 50 meters, overlooking the eponymous hamlet of Kokino.\n\nIt was discovered by archeologist Jovica Stankovski, director of the national museum in Kumanovo, in 2001. In 2002, Stankovski together with Gorje Cenev (who is the head of a planetarium at a Youth Cultural Center in Skopje) published the claim that the site contains a \"megalithic observatory and sacred site\" (мегалитска опсерваторија и светилиште).\n\nThe wider Kokino archaeological site covers about 30 hectares. The oldest archaeological finds date from about the 19th century BC, corresponding to the early European Bronze Age. It shows signs of occupation for the period from the 19th to the 7th centuries BC. Finds from the Middle Bronze Age (c. 16th to 14th centuries BC) are the most numerous (mainly ceramic vessels, stone-mills, a few molds, and a pendant). An agglomeration from the Iron Age was discovered in 2009. The remains of vessels filled with offerings were found deposited in cracks in the rocks, which gave rise to the interpretation of the site as a \"holy mountain\".\n\nThe Kokino \"megalithic observatory\" should be distinguished from the wider Kokino archaeological site. The claimed archaeoastronomical site has a combined area of about 5000 square meters and consists of two platforms with an elevation difference of 19 meters. The claim of the site representing an astronomical observatory was made by Stankovski and by Gjore Cenev in 2002. According to this interpretation, the site includes special stone markers used to track the movement of the Sun and Moon on the eastern horizon. The observatory used the method of stationary observation, marking positions of the Sun at the winter and summer solstice, as well as the equinox. Four stone seats or \"thrones\" are placed in a row on the lower platform. According to Cenev, a stone block with a marking on the upper platform marks the direction of sunrise on summer solstice when viewed from one of the seats. Kokino was briefly mentioned in a poster made by NASA's \"Sun-Earth Connection Education Forum\" in 2005, although in a recent survey of ancient \"observatories\", the Kokino site was described as \"a particularly problematic case\".\n\nThe Cultural Heritage Protection Office of Macedonia's Ministry of Culture declared the site a \"property under temporary protection\" on 13 November 2008 (Decision nr. 08-1935/6). In 2009, Minister of Culture Elizabeta Kancheska-Milevska declared Kokino \"one of the priorities of the Ministry of Culture’s 2009 programme\". In 2009, the Republic of Macedonia also suggested the site be inscribed on the World Heritage Site list.\n\n\n"}

These include the Amber Charter School in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, the Eugenio Maria de Hostos Charter School in Rochester, New York, both of which feature instruction in Spanish and in Hispanic cultures, the Ben Gamla Charter School, the country’s first Hebrew language charter school, which opened in Hollywood, Florida, in 2007, the Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy, the Pioneer Valley Chinese Immersion Charter School, where by grade six all subjects except English language arts will be taught in Chinese, and the Hellenic Classical Charter School in Brooklyn, New York. \n\nA language/culture-based charter school is similar in many respects to a religious charter school. Lawrence D. Weinberg, in his book Religious Charter Schools: Legalities and Practicalities, argues that a charter school can be religious in many ways and that charter schools may accommodate religious beliefs, but not endorse religious beliefs. Religious charter schools would include Catholic schools that converted to charters as happened in Washington, D.C. and some Hebrew or Arabic language schools.\n\n"}
{"id": "7536395", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7536395", "title": "Langue and parole", "text": "Langue and parole\n\nLangue (French, meaning \"language\") and parole (meaning \"speaking\") are linguistic terms distinguished by Ferdinand de Saussure in his \"Course in General Linguistics\". \"Langue\" encompasses the abstract, systematic rules and conventions of a signifying system; it is independent of, and pre-exists, individual users. \"Langue\" involves the principles of language, without which no meaningful utterance, \"parole\", would be possible. \"Parole\" refers to the concrete instances of the use of \"langue\". This is the individual, personal phenomenon of language as a series of speech acts made by a linguistic subject. Saussure did not concern himself overly with \"parole\"; however, the structure of \"langue\" is revealed through the study of \"parole\". The distinction is similar to that made about language by Wilhelm von Humboldt, between \"energeia\" (active doing) and \"ergon\" (the product of that doing), as well as the distinction between \"language\" and \"speech\" made by Jan Baudouin de Courtenay. Saussure drew an analogy to chess to explain the concept of \"langue\" and \"parole\". He compared \"langue\" to the rules of chess—the norms for playing the game—and compared the moves that an individual chooses to make—the individual's preferences in playing the game—to the \"parole\".\n\nWhen translated from the French term \"langue\" can mean language. However, it is known Saussure intended the term to mean internal, arrangement and relationship of rules understood by a social group, however, rarely thought of in everyday life. \"Langue\" is believed to be a universal structure and, while it may have variations as seen in foreign languages, with principal linguistic patterns.\n\n\"Parole\" typically when it is translated means speech. Saussure, on the other hand, intended for it to mean both the written and spoken language as experienced in everyday life. It is the precise utterances and use of \"langue\". Therefore, \"parole\", unlike \"langue\", is as diverse and varied as the number of people who share a language and the number of utterances and attempts to use that language. Furthermore, \"parole\" is known to have been changed and manipulated by a number of causes for example time, social groups, and age of users.\n\nThe underlying basis to \"langue\" is the interpretation that it is made up of signs and not sentences. Signs are thought to have a two part aspect in that each sign relates a notion with a sound pattern (or a written symbol). A sign cannot exist as a single part for if there is a sound pattern without a notion the sound becomes only noise. Similarly, a notion cannot be communicated without a sound pattern.\nThe sound pattern for each notion can be extremely diverse and vice versa. For example, the notion of oneself may use the sound patterns of 'I' or 'me' while the sound pattern of 'rose' may have the notion of a flower or the past of 'rise'. The notion or sound pattern remains unchanged even if the other changes. It is by understanding the relationship of the two parts of a sign through \"langue\" that the gist of communication or \"parole\" may be understood. Without the understanding of \"langue\", \"parole\" would be meaningless sounds or symbols grouped together haphazardly.\nSaussure used the example of chess to explain how \"langue\" and \"parole\" work together. \"Langue\" is the normative rules in a chess game while parole represents the individual's choice of moves. If one were to study the parole of a chess game an understanding could be derived but it would not be a universal understanding of chess. However, by studying the langue of a chess game the derived understanding may be applicable to further chess games.\nThus Saussure argued when studying language, especially a foreign language, it is more important to understand the \"langue\" than to gain a large vocabulary of \"parole\" so that sense may be made equal to that of native speaker.\n\nSaussure did not publish his notes in relation to linguistics and \"langue\" and \"parole\". Unfortunately Cours de linguistique générale was published after his death in 1916 (later translated into English in 1959 as \"Course in General Linguistics\") and was made up of remaining lecture notes by Saussure, course notes provided to students and notes taken by former students of his lectures he performed between 1907-1911 in Geneva. This was then published by two of his former colleagues Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye. It was after this publication that the importance and revolutionary nature of his work truly was understood by linguists and philosophers of his time.\nReviews, commentaries and critics of both the \"Course in General Linguistics\" and original notes made by Saussure have revealed much controversy over time. One controversy is that many ideas and notions often accredited to Saussure may have been borrowed from other linguists and philosophers of the nineteenth century. Saussure's idea of language as a sign system had been proposed by other philosophers, however, he will always be known to have provided a strong, theoretical basis for a scientific approach to understanding language as a whole.\n\nSaussure's \"langue\" and \"parole\" form one of the theoretical foundations of structuralism. \"Langue\" and \"parole\" have allowed structuralists to separately examine the broad structures and formations of literature as well as the individual words. Structuralists achieved this by making a distinction within literary works between the words on a page (\"parole\") and the context behind these words (\"langue\"). Although the reader may appear to simply be reading the words in a book their ability to understand (or possibly misunderstand) the text is a result of a person's knowledge of the \"langue\" or rules of a certain language. Similarly, \"langue\" and \"parole\" have been highly influential in the study of the signs, termed semiotics. Saussure's most notable influence on semiotics was his belief that the rules and codes of a language (\"langue\") are vital in interpreting and gaining an understanding of that language system, while individual utterances (\"parole\") are of little significance. \"Langue\" and \"parole\" have also impacted the way language is taught. Since Saussure's terms have become well known, language teaching often emphasizes teaching the langue and how these rules are applied, rather than simply teaching the words of a certain language. Additionally, \"langue\" and \"parole\" have been applied to other fields of study. Anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss used Structuralism and \"langue\" and \"parole\" to understand myths and tales within a broader context. In this case parole is a single tale or myth, while langue is considered the broader range of tales and myths from within a series or group. These may be myths from the same community, time period or geographical location.\n"}

In these religious traditions, the distinction between the doctrines of Law, which demands obedience to God's ethical will, and Gospel, which promises the forgiveness of sins in light of the person and work of Jesus Christ, is critical. Ministers use it as a hermeneutical principle of biblical interpretation and as a guiding principle in homiletics (sermon composition) and pastoral care. It involves the supersession of the Old Covenant (including traditional Jewish law, or halakha) by the New Covenant and Christian theology.\n\nOther Christian groups have a view on the issue as well, or more generally views of the Old Covenant, though the matter has not usually been as hotly debated or rigorously defined as in the Lutheran and Reformed traditions.\n\nSometimes the issue is discussed under the headings of \"Law and Grace\", \"Sin and Grace\", \"Spirit and Letter\", and \"ministry (, \"diakonia\") of death/condemnation\" and \"ministry of the Spirit/righteousness\".\n\nA specific formulation of the distinction of Law and Gospel was first brought to the attention of the Christian Church by Martin Luther (1483–1546), and laid down as the foundation of evangelical Lutheran biblical exegesis and exposition in Article 4 of the \"Apology of the Augsburg Confession\" (1531): \"All Scripture ought to be distributed into these two principal topics, the Law and the promises. For in some places it presents the Law, and in others the promise concerning Christ, namely, either when [in the Old Testament] it promises that Christ will come, and offers, for His sake, the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal, or when, in the Gospel [in the New Testament], Christ Himself, since He has appeared, promises the remission of sins, justification, and life eternal.\". The Formula of Concord likewise affirmed this distinction in Article V, where it states: \"We believe, teach, and confess that the distinction between the Law and the Gospel is to be maintained in the Church with great diligence...\"\n\nMartin Luther wrote: \"Hence, whoever knows well this art of distinguishing between Law and Gospel, him place at the head and call him a doctor of Holy Scripture.\" Throughout the Lutheran Age of Orthodoxy (1580–1713) this hermeneutical discipline was considered foundational and important by Lutheran theologians.\n\nThis distinction was the first article in \"Patrick`s Places\" (1528) by Patrick Hamilton.\n\nCarl Ferdinand Wilhelm Walther (1811–1887), who was the first (and third) president of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, renewed interest in and attention to this theological skill in his evening lectures at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis 1884-85.\n\nThe Formula of Concord distinguished three uses, or purposes, in the Law in Article VI. It states: \"[T]he Law was given to men for three reasons ...\"\n\n\nThe primary concern was to maintain that the Law should continue to be used by Christians after they had been regenerated by the Holy Spirit through the Gospel to counter the doctrine of Johannes Agricola, who taught that the Law was no longer needed by regenerate Christians.\" Confessional Lutheranism teaches that the Law cannot be used to deny the Gospel, neither can the Gospel be used to deny God's Law.\n\nThe three \"uses\" of the Law are:\n\n\nThe distinction between law and gospel is a standard formulation in Reformed theology, though in recent years some have characterized it as distinctively Lutheran. Zacharias Ursinus sharply distinguished the law and gospel as \"the chief and general divisions of the holy scriptures\" in his commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism. Louis Berkhof called the law and the gospel \"the two parts of the Word of God as a means of grace.\" Law and Gospel are found in both testaments.\n\nIn his \"Institutes of the Christian Religion\", the Reformer John Calvin distinguished three uses in the Law. Calvin wrote the following: \"[T]o make the whole matter clearer, let us survey briefly the function and use of what is called the 'moral law.' Now, so far as I understand it, it consists of three parts.\"\n\n\nThis scheme is the same as the Formula of Concord, with the exception that the first and second uses are switched.\n\nIn later Reformed scholasticism the order is the same as for Lutherans. The three uses are called:\n\n\nThe Heidelberg Catechism, in explaining the third use of the Law, teaches that the moral law as contained in the Ten Commandments is binding for Christians and that it instructs Christians how to live in service to God in gratitude for His grace shown in redeeming mankind. John Calvin deemed this third use of the Law as its primary use.\n\nScholastic Lutheran and Reformed theologians differed primarily on the way in which the third use of the law functions for believers. The Reformed emphasized the third use (\"tertius usus legis\") because the redeemed are expected to bear good works. Some Lutherans saw here the danger of works-righteousness, and argued that the third use should always return believers to the second use and again to Christ rather than being the ultimate norm.\n\nAdditionally, some have suggested that the third use of the law is not found at all in Luther but comes from Philip Melanchthon. Although some Lutherans have rejected that view, it has caused others to dispute the validity of the \"third use\" of the Law entirely. Paul Althaus, for instance, writes in his treatise on Law and Gospel: \"This [ethical] guidance by the Holy Spirit implies that God's concrete commanding cannot be read off from a written document, an inherited scheme of law. I must learn afresh every day what God wants of me. For God's commanding has a special character for each individual: it is always contemporary, always new. God commands me (and each person) in a particular way, in a different way than He commands others... The living and spiritual character of the knowledge of what God requires of men in the present moment must not be destroyed by rules and regulations.\" Such theologians believe the third use leads to or encourages a form of legalism and is possibly an implicit denial of sola fide. Conversely, Reformed Christians have sometimes seen this two-use scheme of some modern Lutherans as leading to a form of antinomianism.\n\nSome believe that \"for Luther the pedagogic use of the Law was primary, while for Calvin this third or didactic use was the principal one; yet [historically] both the Lutheran and the Reformed traditions maintain the threefold conceptualization.\"\n\nJohn Wesley admonished Methodist preachers to emphasize both the Law and the Gospel:\n\nMethodism makes a distinction between the ceremonial law and the moral law that is the Ten Commandments given to Moses. In Methodist Christianity, the moral law is the \"fundamental ontological principle of the universe\" and \"is grounded in eternity\", being \"engraved on human hearts by the finger of God.\" In contradistinction to the teaching of the Lutheran Churches, the Methodist Churches bring the Law and the Gospel together in a profound sense: \"the law is grace and through it we discover the good news of the way life is intended to be lived.\" John Wesley, the father of the Methodist tradition taught:\nCertain recurring grammatical patterns in the Old Testament and in the New involving the sequencing of imperative and indicative predicates are taken by theologians as central to the relationship between Law and Gospel. Daniel Defoe discusses three pairs of these predicates in his second and final sequel to \"Robinson Crusoe\", \"Serious Reflections\" (1720): \"forbear and live\", \"do and live\", \"believe and live\". According to Defoe, the first was established with Adam in paradise, the second as the Law with the children of Israel, and the third as the Gospel of Jesus Christ\n\nHowever Luther viewed all imperative commands as law, even the command to believe the Gospel. In The Bondage of the Will he writes,\n\n\"[T]he commands exist to show, not our moral ability, but our inability. This includes God's command of all men everywhere to repent and believe the gospel, an impossible act of will apart from a supernatural work of the Holy Spirit uniting us to Christ ..\" p. 149\n\nLutheran\n\nReformed\n\n\n\n"}

In 1908, at the age of 30, he was chosen to succeed Bugge as Professor of Old Norse and Icelandic Language and Literature; in 1921 the department was renamed Norse Philology.\n\nDuring his lifetime, Olsen was one of the most prominent and best known scholars in his field. His publications included 7 volumes of Eddic and skaldic poetry with commentary, and also several volumes on runic inscriptions: after assisting Sophus Bugge in completing publication of the inscriptions in the Elder Futhark, he published the first 5 volumes on the inscriptions in the Younger Futhark. Although he took magical interpretations of runic inscriptions further than do later scholars, they were always on a reasoned basis. He assisted as joint editor and editor of 3 volumes in the completion of Oluf Rygh's \"Norske Gaardnavne\". He is best known for the framework he established for dating placenames and relating them to religion and society in the pre-Christian era, which he presented in two books, \"Hedenske Kulturminder i Norske Stedsnavne\" (\"Heathen Cultural Remnants in Norwegian Placenames\" - 1915) and \"Ættegård og Helligdom, Norske Stednavn Sosialt og Religionshistorisk Belyst\" (1926, translated into English as \"Farms and Fanes of Ancient Norway: The Place-Names of a Country Discussed in Their Bearings on Social and Religious History\", 1928). \"Hva våre stedsnavn lærer oss\" (\"What Our Placenames Teach Us\" - 1934) is a succinct introduction to the subject.\n\nOlsen founded the journal \"Maal og Minne\" in 1909, and edited it for 40 years.

{"id": "390846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=390846", "title": "Martha's Vineyard Sign Language", "text": "Martha's Vineyard Sign Language\n\nMartha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL) was a village sign-language that was once widely used on the island of Martha's Vineyard from the early 18th century to 1952. It was used by both deaf and hearing people in the community; consequently, deafness did not become a barrier to participation in public life. Deaf people who spoke Martha's Vineyard Sign Language were extremely independent. They participated in society as typical citizens, although there were incidents of discrimination, and language barriers.\n\nThe language was able to thrive because of the unusually high percentage of deaf islanders and because deafness was a recessive trait, which meant that almost anyone might have both deaf and hearing siblings. In 1854, when the island's deaf population peaked, the United States national average was one deaf person in about 5,730, while on Martha's Vineyard it was one in 155. In the town of Chilmark, which had the highest concentration of deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was deaf.\n\nSign language on the island declined when the population migrated to the mainland. There are no fluent signers of MVSL today. Katie West, the last deaf person born into the island's sign-language tradition, died in 1952, though there were a few elderly residents still able to recall MVSL when researchers started examining the language in the 1980s. Linguists are working to save the language, but their task is difficult because they cannot experience MVSL firsthand.\n\nHereditary deafness had appeared on Martha's Vineyard by 1714. The ancestry of most of the deaf population of Martha's Vineyard can be traced to a forested area in the south of England known as the Weald—specifically the part of the Weald in the county of Kent. Martha's Vineyard Sign Language (MVSL) may be descended from a hypothesized sign language of that area in the 16th century, now referred to as Old Kent Sign Language. Families from a Puritan community in the Kentish Weald emigrated to the Massachusetts Bay Colony in British America in the early 17th century, and many of their descendants later settled on Martha's Vineyard. The first deaf person known to have settled there was Jonathan Lambert, a carpenter and farmer, who moved there with his wife—who was not deaf—in 1694. By 1710, the migration had virtually ceased, and the endogamous community that was created contained a high incidence of hereditary deafness that persisted for over 200 years.\n\nIn the town of Chilmark, which had the highest concentration of deaf people on the island, the average was 1 in 25; at one point, in a section of Chilmark called Squibnocket, as much as 1 in 4 of the population of 60 was deaf. By the 18th century there was a distinct Chilmark Sign Language. In the 19th century, this was influenced by French Sign Language, and evolved into MVSL in the 19th and 20th centuries. From the late 18th to the early 20th century, virtually everybody on Martha's Vineyard possessed some degree of fluency in the language.\n\nIn the early 19th century, a new educational philosophy began to emerge on the mainland, and the country's first school for the deaf opened in 1817 in Hartford, Connecticut (now called the American School for the Deaf). Many of the deaf children of Martha's Vineyard enrolled there, taking their sign language with them. The language of the teachers was French Sign Language, and many of the other deaf students used their own home-sign systems. This school became known as the birthplace of the deaf community in the United States, and the different sign systems used there, including MVSL, merged to become American Sign Language or ASL—now one of the largest community languages in the country.\n\nAs more deaf people remained on the mainland, and others who returned brought with them deaf spouses they met there (whose hearing loss may not have been due to the same hereditary cause), the line of hereditary deafness began to diminish. At the outset of the 20th century, the previously isolated community of fishers and farmers began to see an influx of tourists that would become a mainstay in the island's economy. Jobs in tourism were not as deaf-friendly as fishing and farming had been, and as intermarriage and migration joined the people of Martha's Vineyard to the mainland, the island community grew to resemble the wider community there more and more.\n\nThe last deaf person born into the island's sign-language tradition, Katie West, died in 1952. A few elderly residents were able to recall MVSL as recently as the 1980s when research into the language began. Indeed, when Oliver Sacks subsequently visited the island after reading a book on the subject, he noted that a group of elderly islanders talking together dropped briefly into sign language then back into speech.\n\nAlthough the people who were dependent on MVSL were different, they still did the same activities as the normal Martha's Vineyard resident would. The deaf would work both complex and simple jobs, attend island events, and participate within the community. In contrast to some other deaf communities around the world, they were treated as normal people. The deaf living in rural Mexico have a similar community, but few hearing people live there permanently. Other deaf communities are often isolated from the hearing population; the Martha's Vineyard deaf community of that period is exceptional in its integration into the general population.\n\nDeaf MVSL users were not excluded by the rest of society at Martha's Vineyard, but they certainly faced challenges due to their deafness. Marriage between a deaf person and a hearing person was extremely difficult to maintain, even though both could use MVSL. For this reason, the deaf usually married the deaf, raising the degree of inbreeding even beyond that of the general population of Martha's Vineyard. These deaf-deaf marriages are what really increased the deaf population within this community. The MVSL users often associated closely, helping and working with each other to overcome other issues caused by deafness. They entertained at community events, teaching hearing youngsters more MVSL. The sign language was spoken and taught to hearing children as early as their first years, in order to communicate with the many deaf people they would encounter in school. Lip movement, hand gestures, mannerisms, and facial expressions were all studied. There were even separate schools specifically for learning MVSL. Hearing people sometimes signed even when there were no deaf people present. For example, children signed behind a schoolteacher's back, adults signed to one another during church sermons, farmers signed to their children across a wide field, and fishermen signed to each other from their boats across the water where the spoken word would not carry.\n\nOutside of Martha's Vineyard, though, deaf people were discriminated against. This drove them to try hard to be accepted by locals, which also explains why at first the cochlear implants were not utilized.\n\nMartha's Vineyard Sign Language declined after the opening of the American School for the Deaf. Although students from Martha's Vineyard influenced the creation of American Sign Language with contributions from MVSL, when they returned home, they brought ASL usage back with them, and MVSL faded. Additionally, as transportation became easier in the 19th century, the influx of hearing people meant that more genetic diversity was introduced, and hereditary deafness was no longer commonplace. The last person in the line of hereditary deafness of Martha's Vineyard was Katie West, who died in 1952. Following her death, Oliver Sacks noted in the 1980s that some elderly hearing residents of the island could remember a few signs, but the language truly died out after this point.\n\n"}

It was founded in 1853 by Ann Pamela Cunningham of Rosemont Plantation, South Carolina.\n\nAfter the deaths of George Washington (in 1799) and his widow Martha (in 1802), Mount Vernon remained in the family for three generations. John Augustine Washington III, a great-great-nephew of George Washington, eventually inherited the property, but he could not afford to maintain it. By the 1850s the home was beginning to crumble. However, John Washington would not sell to commercial developers and insisted that the new owner preserve Mount Vernon as an historic site.\n\nHe offered to sell the estate to either the Federal government or the Commonwealth of Virginia, but the legislatures declined, saying it would not be proper to spend taxpayers' money to acquire private property.\n\nIn 1853, South Carolina planter and socialite Louise Dalton Bird Cunningham was riding a ferry down the Potomac River one night. She awoke when the ferry captain signaled the horn as they passed Mount Vernon. She saw that Washington's home was in poor condition. She wrote her daughter, Ann Pamela Cunningham, saying, \"If the men of America have seen fit to allow the home of its most respected hero to go to ruin, why can't the women of America band together to save it?\"\n\nInspired by her mother's words, the younger Cunningham decided to initiate a project to raise money to save the plantation. She wrote an open letter to the editor of the South Carolina newspaper, \"Charleston Mercury\", titled \"To the Ladies of the South.\" It appealed to American women to donate funds to rescue Mount Vernon. \n\nShe also founded the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association and invited influential women from each state (there were 30 at that time) to serve as its original Vice-Regents. It was the first nationwide women's organization in America and the first private preservation organization.\n\nServing as its first Regent, Cunningham began a nationwide fundraising effort through the Association to save the home of the first president. Initially they planned to raise the money and transfer it to Virginia to buy the property. It would delegate care to the Association. That arrangement proved unworkable. In March 1858, Virginia's House of Delegates defeated a bill to buy Mount Vernon.\n\nJohn Washington agreed to sell directly to the Association. The contract was signed in Richmond on April 6, 1858; the gold pen used by Cunningham is held by the Association. He agreed to sell the Mansion, outbuildings, and 200 surrounding acres to the Association for $200,000. He took an immediate down payment of $18,000 and the balance was to be paid in four installments, payable on February 22 (Washington's birthday) each of the next four years. \n\nEdward Everett and William Lowndes Yancey were among supporters who conducted speaking tours about Washington/Mount Vernon to raise money to complete the purchase. The Association raised the capital in about eighteen months, announcing it had met its goal in mid-December 1859. The Association took formal possession on Washington's birthday, and John A. Washington and his family moved out of the Mansion on February 22, 1860. \n\nTo demonstrate their nationwide appeal at a time of high sectional tensions, the Association renamed the group as \"The Mount Vernon Ladies' Association of the Union\". Ann Pamela Cunningham's vision became the Association's mission statement: \nLadies, the home of Washington is in your charge – see to it that you keep it the home of Washington. Let no irreverent hand change it; no vandal hands desecrate it with the fingers of progress. Those who go to the home in which he lived and died wish to see in what he lived and died. Let one spot in this grand country of ours be saved from change. Upon you rests this duty. \n\nThe Association maintains a headquarters on the Mount Vernon property. It has a Regent, or chairman, and 30 trustees, or Vice Regents, who represent their home states. The non-profit Association is fully private, relying on admission fees, revenues from food and gift sales, and donations from foundations, businesses, and individuals.\n\nWhen the Civil War ended in 1865, Vice Regents agreed to take responsibility for the preservation and restoration of individual rooms. Detailed inventories taken in 1799 following George Washington's death were used in determining what furnishings were original to Mount Vernon. Decades of research as well as gifts, loans, and purchases were conducted to get the original furnishings returned to Mt. Vernon.\n\nCongresswoman Frances P. Bolton, who served as Vice Regent from Ohio from 1938 to 1977, launched an effort in the 1940s to preserve the view across the Potomac River. The Association purchased along the (opposite) Maryland shore, which became the nucleus of the Piscataway Park. This has helped preserve the landscape as the Washingtons would have seen it.\n\nOn June 22, 2012, the Association purchased Washington's personal copy of the United States Constitution at auction for $9.8 million. The bound volume was specially printed for Washington in 1789, his first year in office as president, and contains his handwritten notes and markings. George Washington books and manuscripts purchased by the Mount Vernon Ladies’ Association are safeguarded in The Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington.\n\n\n"}

These predicates are unusual because their application is time-dependent; many have tried to solve the new riddle on those terms, but Hilary Putnam and others have argued such time-dependency depends on the language adopted, and in some languages it is equally true for natural-sounding predicates such as \"green.\" For Goodman they illustrate the problem of projectible predicates and ultimately, which empirical generalizations are law-like and which are not.\nGoodman's construction and use of \"grue\" and \"bleen\" illustrates how philosophers use simple examples in conceptual analysis.\n\nGoodman defined grue relative to an arbitrary but fixed time \"t\" as follows: An object is grue if and only if it is observed before \"t\" and is green, or else is not so observed and is blue. An object is bleen if and only if it is observed before \"t\" and is blue, or else is not so observed and is green.\n\nTo understand the problem Goodman posed, it is helpful to imagine some arbitrary future time \"t\", say January 1, 10. For all green things we observe up to time \"t\", such as emeralds and well-watered grass, both the predicates \"green\" and \"grue\" apply. Likewise for all blue things we observe up to time \"t\", such as bluebirds or blue flowers, both the predicates \"blue\" and \"bleen\" apply. On January 2, 10, however, emeralds and well-watered grass are \"bleen\" and bluebirds or blue flowers are \"grue\". Clearly, the predicates \"grue\" and \"bleen\" are not the kinds of predicates we use in everyday life or in science, but the problem is that they apply in just the same way as the predicates \"green\" and \"blue\" up until some future time \"t\". From our current perspective (i.e., before time \"t\"), how can we say which predicates are more projectible into the future: \"green\" and \"blue\" or \"grue\" and \"bleen\"?\n\nIn this section, Goodman's new riddle of induction is outlined in order to set the context for his introduction of the predicates \"grue\" and \"bleen\" and thereby illustrate their philosophical importance.\n\nGoodman poses Hume's problem of induction as a problem of the validity of the predictions we make. Since predictions are about what has yet to be observed and because there is no necessary connection between what has been observed and what will be observed, what is the justification for the predictions we make? We cannot use deductive logic to infer predictions about future observations based on past observations because there are no valid rules of deductive logic for such inferences. Hume's answer was that our observations of one kind of event following another kind of event result in our minds forming habits of regularity (i.e., associating one kind of event with another kind). The predictions we make are then based on these regularities or habits of mind we have formed.\n\nGoodman takes Hume's answer to be a serious one. He rejects other philosophers' objection that Hume is merely explaining the origin of our predictions and not their justification. His view is that Hume has identified something deeper. To illustrate this, Goodman turns to the problem of justifying a system of rules of deduction. For Goodman, the validity of a deductive system is justified by its conformity to good deductive practice. The justification of rules of a deductive system depends on our judgements about whether to reject or accept specific deductive inferences. Thus, for Goodman, the problem of induction dissolves into the same problem as justifying a deductive system and while, according to Goodman, Hume was on the right track with habits of mind, the problem is more complex than Hume realized.\n\nIn the context of justifying rules of induction, this becomes the problem of confirmation of generalizations for Goodman. However, the confirmation is not a problem of justification but instead it is a problem of precisely defining how evidence confirms generalizations. It is with this turn that \"grue\" and \"bleen\" have their philosophical role in Goodman's view of induction.\n\nThe new riddle of induction, for Goodman, rests on our ability to distinguish \"lawlike\" from \"non-lawlike\" generalizations. \"Lawlike\" generalizations are capable of confirmation while \"non-lawlike\" generalizations are not. \"Lawlike\" generalizations are required for making predictions. Using examples from Goodman, the generalization that all copper conducts electricity is capable of confirmation by a particular piece of copper whereas the generalization that all men in a given room are third sons is not \"lawlike\" but accidental. The generalization that all copper conducts electricity is a basis for predicting that this piece of copper will conduct electricity. The generalization that all men in a given room are third sons, however, is not a basis for predicting that a given man in that room is a third son.\n\nWhat then makes some generalizations \"lawlike\" and others accidental? This, for Goodman, becomes a problem of determining which predicates are projectible (i.e., can be used in \"lawlike\" generalizations that serve as predictions) and which are not. Goodman argues that this is where the fundamental problem lies. This problem, known as \"Goodman's paradox\", is as follows. Consider the evidence that all emeralds examined thus far have been green. This leads us to conclude (by induction) that all future emeralds will be green. However, whether this prediction is \"lawlike\" or not depends on the predicates used in this prediction. Goodman observed that (assuming \"t\" has yet to pass) it is equally true that every emerald that has been observed is \"grue\". Thus, by the same evidence we can conclude that all future emeralds will be \"grue\". The new problem of induction becomes one of distinguishing projectible predicates such as \"green\" and \"blue\" from non-projectible predicates such as \"grue\" and \"bleen\".\n\nHume, Goodman argues, missed this problem. We do not, by habit, form generalizations from all associations of events we have observed but only some of them. All past observed emeralds were green, and we formed a habit of thinking the next emerald will be green, but they were equally grue, and we do not form habits concerning grueness. \"Lawlike\" predictions (or projections) ultimately are distinguishable by the predicates we use. Goodman's solution is to argue that \"lawlike\" predictions are based on projectible predicates such as \"green\" and \"blue\" and not on non-projectible predicates such as \"grue\" and \"bleen\" and what makes predicates projectible is their \"entrenchment\", which depends on their successful past projections. Thus, \"grue\" and \"bleen\" function in Goodman's arguments to both illustrate the new riddle of induction and to illustrate the distinction between projectible and non-projectible predicates via their relative entrenchment.\n\nThe most obvious response is to point to the artificially disjunctive definition of grue. The notion of predicate \"entrenchment\" is not required. Goodman, however, noted that this move will not work. If we take \"grue\" and \"bleen\" as primitive predicates, we can define green as \"\"grue\" if first observed before \"t\" and \"bleen\" otherwise\", and likewise for blue. To deny the acceptability of this disjunctive definition of green would be to beg the question.\n\nAnother proposed resolution of the paradox (which Goodman addresses and rejects) that does not require predicate \"entrenchment\" is that \"\"x\" is grue\" is not solely a predicate of \"x\", but of \"x\" and a time \"t\"—we can know that an object is green without knowing the time \"t\", but we cannot know that it is grue. If this is the case, we should not expect \"\"x\" is grue\" to remain true when the time changes. However, one might ask why \"\"x\" is green\" is \"not\" considered a predicate of a particular time \"t\"—the more common definition of \"green\" does not require any mention of a time \"t\", but the definition \"grue\" does. As we have just seen, this response also begs the question because \"blue\" can be defined in terms of \"grue\" and \"bleen\", which explicitly refer to time.\n\nRichard Swinburne gets past the objection that green may be redefined in terms of \"grue\" and \"bleen\" by making a distinction based on how we test for the applicability of a predicate in a particular case. He distinguishes between qualitative and locational predicates. Qualitative predicates, like green, \"can\" be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of \"x\" to a particular time, place or event. Locational predicates, like \"grue\", \"cannot\" be assessed without knowing the spatial or temporal relation of \"x\" to a particular time, place or event, in this case whether \"x\" is being observed before or after time \"t\". Although green can be given a definition in terms of the locational predicates \"grue\" and \"bleen\", this is irrelevant to the fact that green meets the criterion for being a qualitative predicate whereas \"grue\" is merely locational. He concludes that if some \"x\"'s under examination—like emeralds—satisfy both a qualitative and a locational predicate, but projecting these two predicates yields conflicting predictions, namely, whether emeralds examined after time \"t\" shall appear blue or green, we should project the qualitative predicate, in this case green.\n\nRudolf Carnap responded to Goodman's 1946 article. Carnap's approach to inductive logic is based on the notion of \"degree of confirmation\" \"c\"(\"h\",\"e\") of a given hypothesis \"h\" by a given evidence \"e\". Both \"h\" and \"e\" are logical formulas expressed in a simple language \"L\" which allows for\nThe universe of discourse consists of denumerably many individuals, each of which is designated by its own constant symbol; such individuals are meant to be regarded as positions (\"like space-time points in our actual world\") rather than extended physical bodies. A state description is a (usually infinite) conjunction containing every possible ground atomic sentence, either negated or unnegated; such a conjunction describes a possible state of the whole universe. Carnap requires the following semantic properties:\nCarnap distinguishes three kinds of properties:\nTo illuminate this taxonomy, let \"x\" be a variable and \"a\" a constant symbol; then an example of 1. could be \"\"x\" is blue or \"x\" is non-warm\", an example of 2. \"\"x\" = \"a\", and an example of 3. \"x\" is red and not \"x\" = \"a\"\".\n\nBased on his theory of inductive logic sketched above, Carnap formalizes Goodman's notion of projectibility of a property \"W\" as follows: the higher the relative frequency of \"W\" in an observed sample, the higher is the probability that a non-observed individual has the property \"W\". Carnap suggests \"as a tentative answer\" to Goodman, that all purely qualitative properties are projectible, all purely positional properties are non-projectible, and mixed properties require further investigation.\n\nWillard Van Orman Quine discusses an approach to consider only \"natural kinds\" as projectible predicates.\nHe first relates Goodman's grue paradox to Hempel's raven paradox by defining two predicates \"F\" and \"G\" to be (simultaneously) projectible if all their shared instances count toward confirmation of the claim \"each \"F\" is a \"G\"\". Then Hempel's paradox just shows that the complements of projectible predicates (such as \"is a raven\", and \"is black\") need not be projectible, while Goodman's paradox shows that \"is green\" is projectible, but \"is grue\" is not.\n\nNext, Quine reduces projectibility to the subjective notion of \"similarity\". Two green emeralds are usually considered more similar than two grue ones if only one of them is green. Observing a green emerald makes us expect a similar observation (i.e., a green emerald) next time. Green emeralds are a \"natural kind\", but grue emeralds are not. Quine investigates \"the dubious scientific standing of a general notion of similarity, or of kind\". Both are basic to thought and language, like the logical notions of e.g. identity, negation, disjunction. However, it remains unclear how to relate the logical notions to \"similarity\" or \"kind\"; Quine therefore tries to relate at least the latter two notions to each other.\n\nRelation between similarity and kind\n\nAssuming finitely many \"kinds\" only, the notion of \"similarity\" can be defined by that of \"kind\": an object \"A\" is more similar to \"B\" than to \"C\" if \"A\" and \"B\" belong jointly to more kinds than \"A\" and \"C\" do.\n\nVice versa, it remains again unclear how to define \"kind\" by \"similarity\". Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed \"paradigmatical\" red object than this is to another fixed \"foil\" non-red object (cf. left picture) isn't satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little evidence of degree of redness. (In the picture, the yellow paprika might be considered more similar to the red one than the orange.)\n\nAn alternative approach inspired by Carnap defines a natural kind to be a set whose members are more similar to each other than each non-member is to at least one member. \nHowever, Goodman argued, that this definition would make the set of all red round things, red wooden things, and round wooden things (cf. right picture) meet the proposed definition of a natural kind, while \"surely it is not what anyone means by a kind\".\n\nWhile neither of the notions of similarity and kind can be defined by the other, they at least vary together: if \"A\" is reassessed to be more similar to \"C\" than to \"B\" rather than the other way around, the assignment of \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" to kinds will be permuted correspondingly; and conversely.\n\nBasic importance of similarity and kind\n\nIn language, every general term owes its generality to some resemblance of the things referred to. Learning to use a word depends on a double resemblance, viz. between the present and past circumstances in which the word was used, and between the present and past phonetic utterances of the word.\n\nEvery reasonable expectation depends on resemblance of circumstances, together with our tendency to expect similar causes to have similar effects. This includes any scientific experiment, since it can be reproduced only under similar, but not under completely identical, circumstances. Already Heraclitus' famous saying \"No man ever steps in the same river twice\" highlighted the distinction between similar and identical circumstances.\n\nGenesis of similarity and kind\n\nIn a behavioral sense, humans and other animals have an innate standard of similarity. It is part of our animal birthright, and characteristically animal in its lack of intellectual status, e.g. its alieness to mathematics and logic, cf. bird example.\n\nInduction itself is essentially animal expectation or habit formation.\nOstensive learning\nis a case of induction, and a curiously comfortable one, since each man's spacing of qualities and kind is enough like his neighbor's.\nIn contrast, the \"brute irrationality of our sense of similarity\" offers little reason to expect it being somehow in tune with the unanimated nature, which we never made.\nWhy inductively obtained theories about it should be trusted is the perennial philosophical problem of induction. Quine, following Watanabe,\nsuggests Darwin's theory as an explanation: if people's innate spacing of qualities is a gene-linked trait, then the spacing that has made for the most successful inductions will have tended to predominate through natural selection.\nHowever, this cannot account for the human ability to dynamically refine one's spacing of qualities in the course of getting acquainted with a new area.\n\nIn his book \"Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language\", Saul Kripke proposed a related argument that leads to skepticism about meaning rather than skepticism about induction, as part of his personal interpretation (nicknamed \"Kripkenstein\" by some) of the private language argument. He proposed a new form of addition, which he called \"quus\", which is identical with \"+\" in all cases except those in which either of the numbers added are equal to or greater than 57; in which case the answer would be 5, i.e.:\n\nHe then asks how, given certain obvious circumstances, anyone could know that previously when I thought I had meant \"+\", I had not actually meant \"quus\". Kripke then argues for an interpretation of Wittgenstein as holding that the meanings of words are not individually contained mental entities.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "466798", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=466798", "title": "Photorealism", "text": "Photorealism\n\nPhotorealism is a genre of art that encompasses painting, drawing and other graphic media, in which an artist studies a photograph and then attempts to reproduce the image as realistically as possible in another medium. Although the term can be used broadly to describe artworks in many different media, it is also used to refer specifically to a group of paintings and painters of the American art movement that began in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nAs a full-fledged art movement, Photorealism evolved from Pop Art and as a counter to Abstract Expressionism as well as Minimalist art movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States. Photorealists use a photograph or several photographs to gather the information to create their paintings and it can be argued that the use of a camera and photographs is an acceptance of Modernism. However, the admittance to the use of photographs in Photorealism was met with intense criticism when the movement began to gain momentum in the late 1960s, despite the fact that visual devices had been used since the fifteenth century to aid artists with their work.\n\nThe invention of photography in the nineteenth century had three effects on art: portrait and scenic artists were deemed inferior to the photograph and many turned to photography as careers; within nineteenth- and twentieth-century art movements it is well documented that artists used the photograph as source material and as an aid—however, they went to great lengths to deny the fact fearing that their work would be misunderstood as imitations; and through the photograph's invention artists were open to a great deal of new experimentation. Thus, the culmination of the invention of the photograph was a break in art's history towards the challenge facing the artist—since the earliest known cave drawings—trying to replicate the scenes they viewed.\n\nBy the time the Photorealists began producing their bodies of work the photograph had become the leading means of reproducing reality and abstraction was the focus of the art world. Realism continued as an ongoing art movement, even experiencing a reemergence in the 1930s, but by the 1950s modernist critics and Abstract Expressionism had minimalized realism as a serious art undertaking. Though Photorealists share some aspects of American realists, such as Edward Hopper, they tried to set themselves as much apart from traditional realists as they did Abstract Expressionists. Photorealists were much more influenced by the work of Pop artists and were reacting against Abstract Expressionism.\n\nPop Art and Photorealism were both reactionary movements stemming from the ever-increasing and overwhelming abundance of photographic media, which by the mid 20th century had grown into such a massive phenomenon that it was threatening to lessen the value of imagery in art. However, whereas the Pop artists were primarily pointing out the absurdity of much of the imagery (especially in commercial usage), the Photorealists were trying to reclaim and exalt the value of an image.\n\nThe association of Photorealism to \"Trompe L'oeil\" is a wrongly attributed comparison, an error in observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s. Trompe L'oeil paintings attempt to \"fool the eye\" and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that they are looking at a painting.\n\nThe word \"Photorealism\" was coined by Louis K. Meisel in 1969 and appeared in print for the first time in 1970 in a Whitney Museum catalogue for the show \"Twenty-two Realists.\" It is also sometimes labeled as Super-Realism, New Realism, Sharp Focus Realism, or Hyper-Realism.\n\nLouis K. Meisel, two years later, developed a five-point definition at the request of Stuart M. Speiser, who had commissioned a large collection of works by the Photorealists, which later developed into a traveling show known as 'Photo-Realism 1973: The Stuart M. Speiser Collection', which was donated to the Smithsonian in 1978 and is shown in several of its museums as well as traveling under the auspices of 'site'. The definition for the 'originators' was as follows:\n\nPhotorealist painting cannot exist without the photograph. In Photorealism, change and movement must be frozen in time which must then be accurately represented by the artist. Photorealists gather their imagery and information with the camera and photograph. Once the photograph is developed (usually onto a photographic slide) the artist will systematically transfer the image from the photographic slide onto canvases. Usually this is done either by projecting the slide onto the canvas or by using traditional grid techniques. The resulting images are often direct copies of the original photograph but are usually larger than the original photograph or slide. This results in the photorealist style being tight and precise, often with an emphasis on imagery that requires a high level of technical prowess and virtuosity to simulate, such as reflections in specular surfaces and the geometric rigor of man-made environs.\n\nThe first generation of American photorealists includes such painters as John Baeder, Richard Estes, Ralph Goings, Chuck Close, Charles Bell, Audrey Flack, Don Eddy, Robert Bechtle, and Tom Blackwell. Often working independently of each other and with widely different starting points, these original photorealists routinely tackled mundane or familiar subjects in traditional art genres--landscapes (mostly urban rather than naturalistic), portraits, and still lifes. In the UK, photorealist approaches were favoured by many artists including Mike Gorman and Eric Scott. The introduction of these European painters to a wider US audience was brought about through the 1982 'Superhumanism' exhibition at the Arnold Katzen Gallery, New York.\n\nThough the movement is primarily associated with painting, Duane Hanson and John DeAndrea are sculptors associated with photorealism for their painted, lifelike sculptures of average people that were complete with simulated hair and real clothes. They are called \"Verists.\"\n\nThough the height of Photorealism was in the 1970s the movement continues and includes several of the original photorealists as well as many of their contemporaries. According to Meisel and Chase's \"Photorealism at the Millennium\", only eight of the original photorealists were still creating photorealist work in 2002; ten including John Baeder and Howard Kanovitz.\n\nArtists Charles Bell, John Kacere, and Howard Kanovitz have died; Audrey Flack, Chuck Close, and Don Eddy have moved away from photorealism; and Robert Cottingham no longer considers himself a photorealist.\n\nNewer Photorealists are building upon the foundations set by the original photorealists. Examples would be the influence of Richard Estes in works by Anthony Brunelli or the influence of Ralph Goings and Charles Bell in works by Glennray Tutor. However, this has led many to move on from the strict definition of photorealism as the emulation of the photograph. Photorealism is also no longer simply an American art movement. Starting with Franz Gertsch in the 1980s Clive Head, Raphaella Spence, Bertrand Meniel, and Roberto Bernardi are several European artists associated with photorealism that have emerged since the mid-1990s. This internationalization of photorealism is also seen in photorealist events, such as The Prague Project, in which American and non-American photorealist painters have traveled together to locations including Prague, Zurich, Monaco and New York, to work alongside each other in producing work.\n\nThe evolution of technology has brought forth photorealistic paintings that exceed what was thought possible with paintings; these newer paintings by the photorealists are sometimes referred to as \"Hyperrealism.\" With new technology in cameras and digital equipment, artists are able to be far more precision-oriented and can produce imagery using a wider range of media. The artist Bill Fink has developed his own technique for creating photorealistic images using soil, pollen, human hair, and cremated human remains.\n\nPhotorealism's influence and popularity continues to grow, with new books such as Juxtapoz's 2014 book entitled \"Hyperreal\" detailing current trends within the artistic genre.\n\n\nSignificant artists whose work helped define Photorealism:\n\nSignificant artists whose work meets the criteria of Photorealism:\n"}
{"id": "914267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=914267", "title": "Possessive", "text": "Possessive\n\nA possessive form (abbreviated ) is a word or grammatical construction used to indicate a relationship of possession in a broad sense. This can include strict ownership, or a number of other types of relation to a greater or lesser degree analogous to it.\n\nMost European languages feature possessive forms associated with personal pronouns, like the English \"my\", \"mine\", \"your\", \"yours\", \"his\" and so on. There are two main ways in which these can be used (and a variety of terminologies for each):\n\nSome languages, including English, also have possessive forms derived from nouns or noun phrases, such as \"Jane's\", \"cows' \" and \"nobody else's\". These can be used in the same two ways as the pronoun-derived forms: adjectivally, as in \"Jane's office\"; and substantivally, as in \"that one is Jane's\".\n\nPossessives are sometimes regarded as a grammatical case (the possessive case), although they are also sometimes considered to represent the genitive case, or are not assigned to any case, depending on which language is being considered. On the other hand, some languages, such as the Cariban languages, can be said to have a possessed case, used to indicate the other party (the thing possessed) in a possession relationship. A similar feature found in some languages is the possessive affix, usually a suffix, added to the (possessed) noun to indicate the possessor, as in the Finnish \"taloni\" (\"my house\"), where \"talo\" means \"house\" and the suffix \"-ni\" means \"my\".\n\nThe concepts of possessive forms and genitive forms are sometimes conflated, although they are not exactly the same. The genitive form, which does not exist in modern English as an inflection, represents an \"of\" relationship, which may or may not be possessive; in other words, the possessive is a subset of genitive. For example, the genitive form \"speed of the car\" is equivalent to the possessive form \"the car's speed\". However, the genitive form \"pack of dogs\" is not the same as the possessive form \"dogs' pack\" (though it is the same as \"dog pack\", which is not possessive).\n\nThe glossing abbreviation or may be used to indicate possessive forms.\n\nIt is common for languages to have independent possessive determiners (adjectives) and possessive pronouns corresponding to the personal pronouns of the language. For example, to the English personal pronouns \"I\", \"you\", \"he\", \"she\", \"it\", \"we\", \"they\", there correspond the respective possessive determiners \"my\", \"your\", \"his\", \"her\", \"its\", \"our\" and \"their\", and the (substantival) possessive pronouns \"mine\", \"yours\", \"his\", \"hers\", \"its\" (rare), \"ours\" and \"theirs\". In some instances there is no difference in form between the determiner and the pronoun; examples include the English \"his\" (and \"its\"), and informal Finnish \"meidän\" (meaning either \"our\" or \"ours\").\n\nIn some languages, possessive determiners are subject to agreement with the noun they modify, and possessive pronouns may be subject to agreement with their antecedent, in terms of relevant categories of gender, number and case. For example, French has \"mon\", \"ma\", \"mes\", respectively the masculine singular, feminine singular and plural forms corresponding to the English \"my\", as well as the various possessive pronoun forms \"le mien\", \"la mienne\", \"les mien(ne)s\" corresponding to English \"mine\".\n\nSince personal pronouns may also agree in number and gender with their own antecedent or referent, the possessive forms may consequently show agreement with either the \"possessor\" or the \"possessed\", or both. In French (and most other Romance languages) the third-person singular possessives do not indicate the gender of the possessor, although they agree with the possessed (\"son\", \"sa\" and \"ses\" can all mean either \"his\", \"her\" or \"its\"). This contrasts with English and standard Dutch, where the form of the possessives (\"his\", \"her\", \"its\"; \"zijn\", \"haar\") indicates the grammatical or natural gender of the possessor, but does not depend on properties of the possessed. However German and several Dutch dialects additionally inflect their possessives, thus giving agreement with both possessor and possessed; German has \"sein\" and \"ihr\" meaning \"his\" and \"her\" respectively, but these inflect to give (for example) feminine forms like \"seine\" and \"ihre\", depending on the gender (and number and case) of the thing possessed.\n\nIn languages that have a genitive case, the possessive forms corresponding to pronouns may or may not resemble the genitive of those pronouns. For example, in Russian, the genitive of я \"ja\" \"I\" is меня \"menya\" (\"of me\"), whereas the corresponding possessive is мой \"moy\" (\"my, mine\", in masculine singular nominative form). In German the two sets of forms are quite similar (for example, the genitive of \"ich\" \"I\" is \"meiner\", the corresponding possessive pronoun is also \"meiner\" in the masculine singular nominative, and the possessive determiner is \"mein\" with various endings).\n\nSome languages have no distinct possessive determiners as such, instead using a pronoun together with a possessive particle – a grammatical particle used to indicate possession. For example, in Japanese, \"my\" or \"mine' can be expressed as \"watashi no\", where \"watashi\" means \"I\" and \"no\" is the possessive particle. Similarly in Mandarin Chinese, \"my\" or \"mine\" is \"wǒ de\", where \"wǒ\" means \"I\" and \"de\" is the possessive particle.\n\nAn alternative to the pronominal possessive determiner, found in some languages, including Finnish and Hungarian, is the possessive affix, usually a suffix, attached to the noun denoting the thing possessed. For example, in Finnish the suffix \"-ni\" means \"my\", producing forms such as \"taloni\" (\"my house\"), from \"talo\" (\"house\"). Hungarian possessive suffixes are used in a similar way, as in \"háza\" (\"his/her house\"), formed from \"ház\" (\"house\"). In Hungarian this affix can also be used when the possessor is represented by a full noun, as described in the next section.\n\nPronouns other than personal pronouns, if they have possessive forms, are likely to form them in a similar way to nouns (see below). In English, for example, possessive forms derived from other pronouns include \"one's\", \"somebody's\" and \"nobody's\". There is however a distinct form \"whose\" for the possessive of the interrogative and relative pronoun \"who\"; other languages may have similarly functioning words, such as the Russian чей \"chey\" (\"whose?\"). Another possessive found in Russian and other Slavic languages is the reflexive possessive, corresponding to the general reflexive pronoun; the Russian form is свой \"svoj\" (meaning \"one's (own)\", \"my (own)\", etc.).\n\nIn some languages, possessives are formed from nouns or noun phrases. In English, this is done using the ending \"-'s\", as in \"Jane's\", \"heaven's\", \"the boy's\", \"those men's\", or sometimes just an apostrophe, as in \"workers',\" \"Jesus',\" \"the soldiers'.\" Note that the ending can be added at the end of a noun phrase even when the phrase does not end with its head noun, as in \"the king of England's\"; this property inclines many linguists towards the view that the ending is a clitic rather than a case ending (see below, and further at English possessive).\n\nIn languages that have a genitive case, the genitive form of a noun may sometimes be used as a possessive (as in German \"Karls Haus\" \"Karl's house\"). Languages such as Japanese and Chinese form possessive constructions with nouns using possessive particles, in the same way as described for pronouns above. An example from Japanese is \"neko no iro\" (\"the cat's color\"), where \"neko\" means \"cat\", \"no\" is the particle, and \"iro\" means \"color\".\n\nIn other languages, noun possessives must be formed periphrastically, as in French \"la plume de ma tante\" (\"my aunt's pen\", literally \"the pen of my aunt\"). In Hungarian, the construction \"Mária háza\" is used (\"Maria's house\", literally \"Maria her house\", where the final \"-a\" in \"háza\" is the possessive suffix meaning \"her\"). The possessor noun can carry an additional dative marker, in which case an article appears before the noun. For example, \"Peter's house\" may be translated either as \"Péter háza\" (literally \"Peter his-house\"), or \"Péternek a háza\" (\"of-Peter the his-house\").\n\nPossessive determiners (adjectives) are used in combination with a noun, playing the role of a determiner or attributive adjective. In English and some other languages, the use of such a word implies the definite article. For example, \"my car\" implies \"the car that belongs to me/is used by me\"; it is not correct to precede possessives with an article (*\"the my car\") or other definite determiner such as a demonstrative (*\"this my car\"), although they can combine with quantifiers in the same ways that \"the\" can (\"all my cars\", \"my three cars\", etc.; see English determiners). This is not the case in all languages; for example in Italian the possessive is usually preceded by another determiner such as an article, as in \"la mia macchina\" (\"my car\", literally \"the my car\") or \"quel tuo libro\" (\"that book of yours\", literally \"that your book\").\n\nSome languages place the possessive after the noun, as in Norwegian \"boka mi\" (\"my book\"). Here again the equivalent of the definite article – in this case the definite ending \"-a\" on the noun \"bok\" – is used in addition to the possessive. However, the forms \"min bok\" or \"mi bok\", where the noun \"bok\" is in the indefinite form, are equally correct.\n\nPossessive determiners may be modified with an adverb, as adjectives are, although not as freely or as commonly as is the case with adjectives. Such modification is generally limited to such adverbs as \"more\", \"less\", or \"as much ... as\" (comparative) or \"mostly\" (superlative), for example in \"This is more my team than your team\" and \"This is mostly my team\".\n\nSubstantival possessive pronouns are used on their own and cannot be used to describe a noun, playing the role of noun phrases, so \"mine\" may stand for \"my cat\", \"my sister\", \"my things\", etc. In some languages these may require articles or other determiners, as the French \"le mien\" etc. In English, the \"-'s\" possessives formed from nouns or noun phrases can be used in the same way; \"the president's\" may stand for \"the president's office\", \"the president's policies\", etc., as determined by the context.\n\nA related use is that of the predicative expression, as in sentences like \"the book is mine\". Here \"mine\" may be considered to be a predicate adjective (like \"red\" in \"the book is red\") rather than a pronoun; in English, however, the same possessive form is used anyway. Other languages may use differing forms; for example French may use \"...est à moi\" for \"...is mine\".\n\nA particular use of possessive pronouns (and equivalent noun forms) in English is that illustrated in phrases like \"a friend of mine\" and \"that coat of Fred's\", used to form possessive expressions when the desired determiner is something other than the default \"the\" implied in the usual possessive determiner.\n\nThe terminology used for possessive words and phrases is not consistent among all grammarians and linguists.\n\nWhat some authors refer to as \"possessives\", others may call \"genitives\", and vice versa. Nowadays, however, the term \"genitive\" is most commonly used in relation to languages with a developed case system (in which the \"genitive case\" often has a wider range of functions than merely forming possessives), while in languages like English, where their status as a grammatical case is doubtful, such words are usually called possessives rather than genitives. A given language may have distinct genitive and possessive forms, as in the example of Russian given above. (The English possessive in \"-'s\" is sometimes called the \"Saxon genitive\"; this alludes to its derivation from the genitive case that existed in Old English. It may also be called the \"prenominal genitive\"; this also applies to analogous forms in languages such as German.)\n\nWords like the English \"my\" and \"your\" have traditionally been called \"possessive adjectives\". However, some modern linguists note that in a language such as English they behave like determiners rather than true adjectives (see examples in the section above), and thus prefer to call them \"possessive determiners\". In some other languages, however, the equivalent words behave more like true adjectives (compare the Italian example above, for instance).\n\nWhile for most authors the term \"possessive pronoun\" is reserved (as in this article) for possessives like \"mine\" and \"yours\" which do not qualify an explicit noun, the term is sometimes taken also to include other possessive forms that correspond to pronouns, even though they behave as determiners, qualifying a noun, such as \"my\" and \"your\".\n\nSome authors who classify both sets of words as \"possessive pronouns\" or \"genitive pronouns\" apply the terms dependent/independent or weak/strong to refer, respectively, to \"my\", \"your\", etc. and \"mine\", \"yours\", etc. Thus \"my\" is termed a \"dependent\" (or \"weak\") \"possessive pronoun\", while \"mine\" is an \"independent\" (or \"strong\") \"possessive pronoun\". Also, the first set may be called \"adjectival\" and the second set \"substantival\" possessive pronouns.\n\nAccording to the \"OED\", the first reference to possessive pronouns is found in 1530; the first use of \"possessive\" as a noun occurs in 1591, the first use of \"possessive case\" (which notes that it is like the Latin genitive, and may be called the genitive case in reference to English also) occurs in 1763, and the first use of \"possessive adjective\" dates from 1870.\n\nNouns or pronouns taking the form of a possessive are sometimes described as being in the \"possessive case\". A more commonly \n-used term in describing the grammar of various languages is \"genitive case\", but that usually denotes a case with a broader range of functions than just producing possessive forms. (Some languages occasionally use the dative case to denote the possessor, as in the Serbo-Croatian \"kosa mu je gusta\" \"his hair is thick\" (literally \"the hair to him is thick\" in which \"to him\" is the dative pronoun \"mu\").)\n\nOther theorists reject the idea that the possessive in languages like English as represents a grammatical case since possessive forms do not generally behave in a parallel fashion to what are normally identified as cases. In particular, in English, as noted above, the \"-'s\" can attach to noun phrases even when they do not end with their head noun, as in \"the king of Spain's\", which is not typical behavior for a case ending. For further discussion of the issue, see .\n\nSome languages, such as the Cariban languages, can be said to have a \"possessed case\" to indicate the other party (the thing possessed) in a possession relationship.\n\nThe relationship expressed by possessive determiners and similar forms is not necessarily one of possession in the strict sense of ownership. In English, strict possession has been found to be expressed in only about 40% of the situations labeled as \"possessive\" by linguists, a fact which may incline some to prefer the more traditional term \"genitive\". The \"possessor\" may be, for example:\n\nFor more examples, see Possession (linguistics) and .\n\n\n"}

ROHO staff also conduct research on a wide range of historical topics, utilizing oral history as a central primary source to their scholarship.\n\nROHO's original name was the Regional Cultural History Office. It was the second oral history office founded in the country, following only Columbia University. The first interview conducted at the office, before it was officially recognized as a unit on campus, was with Alice B. Toklas, the long-time partner of Gertrude Stein.\n\nSince its founding in 1954, ROHO has conducted thousands of interviews in a wide variety of subject areas ranging from law and jurisprudence to food and wine. ROHO features especially strong collections on the development of the arts and letters, science and technology, and labor, social, political, and community history in California. ROHO has also conducted numerous interviews on the history of the University of California. ROHO's interviews with scientists include Nobel Prize winners such as Arthur Kornberg, Paul Berg, Donald A.

It is generally associated with the American anthropologist Franz Boas; he and his students aimed to record vanishing Native American cultures. Since the 1960s, anthropologists have used the term as part of a critique of 19th-century ethnography and early modern anthropology. \n\nThe term \"salvage ethnography\" was coined by Jacob W. Gruber, who identified its emergence with 19th-century ethnographers documenting the languages of peoples being conquered and colonized by European countries or the United States. According to Gruber, one of the first official statements acknowledging that a major effect of colonialism was the destruction of existing languages and ways of life was \"The report of the British Select Committee of Aborigines\" (1837). \n\nAs a scholarly response, Gruber quotes James Cowles Prichard's address before the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1839, referring to the Old Testament tale of Cain and Abel:\nFrances Densmore (1867–1957), an influential ethnomusicologist, worked in the tradition of salvage ethnography. Densmore recorded the songs and lyrics of Native Americans in an attempt to preserve them permanently. Many of her original recordings, preserved on wax cylinders, are archived at the Library of Congress.\n\nArtists compounded the work of professional anthropologists during this time period. Photographer Edward S. Curtis (1868–1952) was preceded by painter George Catlin (1796–1872) in attempting to capture indigenous North American traditions that they believed to be disappearing. Both Curtis and Catlin have been accused of taking artistic license by embellishing a scene or making something appear more authentically \"Native American\". Curtis notes in the introduction to his series on the North American Indian: \"The information that is to be gathered ... respecting the mode of life of one of the great races of mankind, must be collected at once or the opportunity will be lost.\" This statement reflects the artist's paternalistic concern for documenting the culture of American Indians and is representative of both the popular and academic sentiment of the time.\n\nSalvage ethnography started to be applied methodically in visual anthropology as ethnographic film since the 1950s by filmmakers such as Jean Rouch in France, Michel Brault and Pierre Perrault in Canada, or António Campos in Portugal (early 1960s), followed by others (1970s).\n\nSalvage ethnography is often taught in film and media studies courses as a style of filmmaking that captures a civilization or people's former way of living. The best example of this would be Robert Flaherty's \"Nanook of the North\". In \"Nanook\", Flaherty staged incidents and scenes that did not fairly represent the Inuit tribe's current way of life, but rather their \"former majesty\".\n\n\n"}

Archaeological excavation, initially by Sir Flinders Petrie, revealed ancient mining camps and a long-lived Temple of Hathor, the Egyptian goddess who was favoured as a protector in desert regions.\n\nThirty incised graffiti in a \"Proto-Sinaitic script\" shed light on the history of the alphabet. The mines were worked by prisoners of war from southwest Asia who presumably spoke a Northwest Semitic language, such as the Canaanite that was ancestral to Phoenician and Hebrew. After a century of study and the initial publication by Sir Flinders Petrie, researchers agree on the decipherment of a single phrase, cracked in 1916 by Alan Gardiner: לבעלת ' (to the Lady) [' (Lady) being a title of Hathor and the feminine of the title \"\" (Lord) given to the Semitic god], although the word \" (loved) is frequently cited as a second word. \n\nThe script has graphic similarities with the Egyptian hieratic script, the less elaborate form of the hieroglyphs. In the 1950s and 1960s it was common to show the derivation of the Canaanite alphabet from hieratic, using William Albright's interpretations of Proto-Sinaitic as the key. It was generally accepted that the language of the inscriptions was Semitic, that the script had a hieratic prototype and was ancestral to the Semitic alphabets, and that the script was itself acrophonic and alphabetic (more specifically, a consonantal alphabet or abjad). The word \" (Lady) lends credence to the identification of the language as Semitic. However, the lack of further progress in decipherment casts doubt over the other suppositions, and the identification of the hieratic prototypes remains speculative.\n\nRomanus Francois Butin of Catholic University of America published articles in the \"Harvard Theological Review\" based on the 1927 Harvard Mission to Serabit and the 1930 Harvard-Catholic University Joint Expedition. His article \"The Serabit Inscriptions: II. The Decipherment and Significance of the Inscriptions\" provides an early detailed study of the inscriptions and some dozen B/W photographs, hand-drawings and analysis of the previously published inscriptions, #346, 349, 350-354, and three new inscriptions, #355-368. At that time, #355 was still in situ at Serabit but had not been photographed by the previous Harvard Mission. In 1932, he wrote: \"The present article was begun with the limited purpose of making known the new inscriptions discovered by the Harvard-Catholic University Joint Expedition to Serabit in the spring of 1930. In the course of this study, I perceived that some signs doubtful in the inscriptions already published were made clear by the new slabs, and I decided to go over the entire field again.\" Both articles provide an analysis of the Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions during earlier expeditions to the site.\n\nIn her book \"A History of Sinai\", Lina Eckenstein theorized that Serabit el-Khadim was the historical site of Mt. Sinai where Moses received the 10 commandments. This theory comes in no small part to the site containing a temple of Hathor which is believed to be the Golden Calf idol constructed by the Hebrews while Moses was on the mountain top.\n\n\n"}

It may take ten years for an agency to groom the trainee and for them to debut on stage, according to the former head of the Korea Entertainment Law Society. Both trainees and K-pop idols who have debuted typically live in dormitories, where their management agencies control their diets, their love lives, and their behaviour. Under most contracts, trainees and K-pop idols are required to pay back their management agencies for the cost of singing and dancing lessons, their wardrobes and living costs, among other things. As a result, K-pop idols may not make large profits.\n\nMany K-pop groups often take years to break even, and thus do not receive their share of any profits made from their songs until their trainee debt is paid off. The notable exception to this are groups from the \"Big 3\" companies - SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment. Trainees under these three companies get paid as soon as they debut and generally do not face trainee debt at all, unless they leave before completion of their contracts.\n\nIn 2008, three members of the boy band TVXQ took their management agency SM Entertainment to court, claiming that the agency's 13-year-contract was too long, too restrictive, and gave them almost none of the profits from their success. The following year, in 2009, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) created a rule that limited entertainment contracts to seven years. In 2017, the KFTC again put restrictions on entertainment contracts. Among other things, the 2017 reforms reduced the financial penalties for K-pop trainees that break their contracts early and made it more difficult for companies to force K-pop idols to renew their contracts.\n"}

The story is a \"powerful satire\" on the relationship between India and Pakistan.\n\nThe story is set two or three years after the 1947 independence, when the governments of India and Pakistan decided to exchange some Muslim, Sikh and Hindu lunatics, and revolves around Bishan Singh, a Sikh inmate of an asylum in Lahore, who is from the town of Toba Tek Singh. As part of the exchange, Bishan Singh is sent under police escort to India, but upon being told that his hometown Toba Tek Singh is in Pakistan, he refuses to go.

A major religious hub in India, it is the holiest of the seven sacred cities (\"Sapta Puri\") in Hinduism and Jainism, and played an important role in the development of Buddhism and Ravidassia. Varanasi lies along National Highway 2, which connects it to Kolkata, Kanpur, Agra, and Delhi, and is served by Varanasi Junction railway station and Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport.\n\nVaranasi is also one of 72 districts in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. At the time of the 2011 census, there were a total of 8 blocks and 1329 villages in this district. The main languages of Varanasi are the Awadhi and Bhojpuri dialects of Hindi-Urdu.\n\nVaranasi grew as an important industrial centre, famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, \"The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma\", at nearby Sarnath. The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi. During the Muslim rule through Middle Ages, the city continued as an important centre of Hindu devotion, pilgrimage, mysticism and poetry which further contributed to its reputation as a centre of cultural importance and religious education. Tulsidas wrote his epic poem on Rama's life called \"Ram Charit Manas\" in Varanasi. Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir and Ravidas. Guru Nanak visited Varanasi for Maha Shivaratri in 1507, a trip that played a large role in the founding of Sikhism.\n\nIn the 16th century, Varanasi experienced a cultural revival under the Mughal emperor Akbar who patronised the city, and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu, though much of modern Varanasi was built during the 18th century, by the Maratha and Brahmin kings. The Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947. The city is governed by the Varanasi Nagar Nigam (Municipal Corporation) and is represented in the Parliament of India by the current Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, who won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 by a huge margin. Silk weaving, carpets and crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do the Diesel Locomotive Works and Bharat Heavy Electricals. Varanasi Hospital was established in 1964.\n\nVaranasi has been a cultural centre of North India for several thousand years, and is closely associated with the Ganges. Hindus believe that death in the city will bring salvation, making it a major centre for pilgrimage. The city is known worldwide for its many ghats, embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. Of particular note are the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead and the Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi are kept here.\n\nThe Ramnagar Fort, near the eastern bank of the Ganges, was built in the 18th century in the Mughal style of architecture with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. Among the estimated 23,000 temples in Varanasi are Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Shiva, the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, and the Durga Temple. The Kashi Naresh (Maharaja of Kashi) is the chief cultural patron of Varanasi, and an essential part of all religious celebrations. An educational and musical centre, many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the Benares gharana form of Hindustani classical music was developed. One of Asia's largest residential universities is Banaras Hindu University (BHU). The Hindi-language nationalist newspaper, \"Aj\", was first published in 1920.\n\nTraditional etymology links \"Varanasi\" to the names of two Ganges tributaries forming the city's borders: Varuna, still flowing in northern Varanasi, and Assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat. The old city is located on the north shores of the Ganges, bounded by Varuna and Assi.\n\nIn the Rigveda, an ancient Indian sacred collection of Vedic Sanskrit hymns, the city is referred to as Kāśī (Kashi) from the Sanskrit verbal root \"kaś-\" \"to shine\", making Varanasi known as \"City of Light\", the \"luminous city as an eminent seat of learning\". The name was also used by pilgrims dating from Buddha's days.\n\nHindu religious texts use many epithets to refer to Varanasi, such as Kāśikā (), Avimukta (Sanskrit: \"never forsaken\" by Shiva), Ānandavana (Sanskrit: \"the forest of bliss\"), and Rudravāsa (Sanskrit: \"the place where Rudra/Śiva resides\").\n\nAccording to Hindu mythology, Varanasi was founded by Shiva, one of three principal deities along with Brahma and Vishnu. During a fight between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonored Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.\n\nThe Pandavas, the protagonists of the Hindu epic \"Mahabharata\", are said to have visited the city in search of Shiva to atone for their sin of fratricide and Brāhmanahatya that they had committed during the climactic Kurukshetra War. It is regarded as one of seven holy cities (Sapta Puri) which can provide Moksha; Ayodhya, Mathura, Haridwar, Kashi, Kanchi, Avanti, and Dvārakā are the seven cities known as the givers of liberation.\n\nExcavations in 2014 led to the discovery of artefacts dating back to 800 BCE. Further excavations at Aktha and Ramnagar, two sites in the vicinity of the city, unearthed artefacts dating back to 1800 BCE, supporting the view that the area was inhabited by this time.\n\nVaranasi grew as an important industrial centre, famous for its muslin and silk fabrics, perfumes, ivory works, and sculpture. During the time of Gautama Buddha, Varanasi was part of the Kingdom of Kosala. The Buddha is believed to have founded Buddhism here around 528 BCE when he gave his first sermon, \"The Setting in Motion of the Wheel of Dharma\", at nearby Sarnath. The celebrated Chinese traveller Xuanzang, also known as Hiuen Tsiang, who visited the city around 635 CE, attested that the city was a centre of religious and artistic activities, and that it extended for about along the western bank of the Ganges. When Xuanzang, visited Varanasi in the 7th century, he named it \"Polonisse\" and wrote that the city had some 30 temples with about 30 monks. The city's religious importance continued to grow in the 8th century, when Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi.\n\nChandradeva, founder of the Gahadavala dynasty made Banaras a second capital in 1090. During the Mauryan era, Varanasi was connected by a road starting from Taxila and ending at Pataliputra.\n\nVaranasi remained a centre of activity for intellectuals and theologians during the Middle Ages, which further contributed to its reputation as a cultural centre of religion and education. Several major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir who was born here in 1389, and Ravidas, a 15th-century socio-religious reformer, mystic, poet, traveller, and spiritual figure, who was born and lived in the city and employed in the tannery industry.\n\nNumerous eminent scholars and preachers visited the city from across India and south Asia. Guru Nanak visited Varanasi for Maha Shivaratri in 1507, a trip that played a large role in the founding of Sikhism.\n\nVaranasi experienced a \"Hindu\" cultural revival in the 16th century under the Muslim Mughal emperor Akbar, who invested in the city and built two large temples dedicated to Shiva and Vishnu. The Raja of Pune established the Annapurna Mandir, and the Akbari Bridge was also completed during this period. The earliest tourists began arriving in the city during the 16th century. In 1665, the French traveller Jean-Baptiste Tavernier described the architectural beauty of the Vindu Madhava temple on the side of the Ganges. The road infrastructure was also improved during this period. It was extended from Kolkata to Peshawar by Emperor Sher Shah Suri; later during the British Raj it came to be known as the famous Grand Trunk Road. In 1656, Emperor Aurangzeb ordered the destruction of many temples and the building of mosques, causing the city to experience a temporary setback. However, after Aurangazeb's death, most of India was ruled by a confederacy of pro-Hindu kings. Much of modern Varanasi was built during this time, especially during the 18th century by the Maratha and Bhumihar. The kings governing Varanasi continued to wield power and importance through much of the British Raj period, including the Maharaja of Benares, or Kashi Naresh.\nThe Kingdom of Benares was given official status by the Mughals in 1737, and continued as a dynasty-governed area until Indian independence in 1947, during the reign of Dr. Vibhuti Narayan Singh. In the 18th century, Muhammad Shah ordered the construction of an observatory on the Ganges, attached to Man Mandir Ghat, designed to discover imperfections in the calendar in order to revise existing astronomical tables. Tourism in the city began to flourish in the 18th century. In 1791, under the rule of the British Governor-General Warren Hastings, Jonathan Duncan founded a Sanskrit College in Varanasi. In 1867, the establishment of the Varanasi Municipal Board led to significant improvements in the city's infrastructure and basic amenities of health services, drinking water supply and sanitation \nThe British Army committed a massacre of Indian troops and destroyed city residences during the early stages of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nAuthor Mark Twain wrote in 1897 of Varanasi, \"Benares is older than history, older than tradition, older even than legend, and looks twice as old as all of them put together.\" In 1910, the British made Varanasi a new Indian state, with Ramnagar as its capital, but with no jurisdiction over the city proper. The religious head, Kashi Naresh, has had his headquarters at the Ramnagar Fort since the 18th century, also a repository of the history of the kings of Varanasi, which is situated to the east of Varanasi, across the Ganges. The Kashi Naresh is deeply revered by the local people and the chief cultural patron; some devout inhabitants consider him to be the incarnation of Shiva.\n\nAnnie Besant founded the Central Hindu College, which later became a foundation for the creation of Banaras Hindu University in 1916. Besant founded the college because she wanted \"to bring men of all religions together under the ideal of brotherhood in order to promote Indian cultural values and to remove ill-will among different sections of the Indian population.\"\n\nVaranasi was ceded to the Union of India in 1947, and Vibhuti Narayan Singh incorporated his territories into the United Provinces in 1949.\n\nVaranasi is located at an elevation of in the centre of the Ganges valley of North India, in the Eastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, along the left crescent-shaped bank of the Ganges, averaging between and above the river. The city is the headquarters of Varanasi district. By road, Varanasi is located south-east of New Delhi, south-east of Lucknow, east of Allahabad, and south of Jaunpur. The \"Varanasi Urban Agglomeration\" – an agglomeration of seven urban sub-units – covers an area of 112.26 km (approximately 43 mi²). Neighbourhoods of the city include Adampura, Anandbagh, Bachchhaon, Bangali Tola, Bhelpura, Bulanala, Chaitganj, Chaukaghat, Chowk, Dhupchandi, Dumraon, Gandhinagar, Gautam Nagar, Giri Nagar, Gopal Vihar, Guru Nanak Nagar, Jaitpura, Kail Garh, Khanna, Kotwali, Lanka Manduadih, Luxa, Maheshpur, Mahmoorganj, Maulvibagh, Nagwar, Naipokhari, Shivala, Siddhagiribagh, and Sigra.\n\nBeing located in the Indo-Gangetic Plains of North India, the land is very fertile because low level floods in the Ganges continually replenish the soil. Varanasi is located between the Ganges confluences with two rivers: the Varuna and the Assi stream. The distance between the two confluences is around , and serves as a sacred journeying route for Hindus, which culminates with a visit to a Sakshi Vinayak Temple.\n\nVaranasi experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification \"Cwa\") with large variations between summer and winter temperatures. The dry summer starts in April and lasts until June, followed by the monsoon season from July to October. The temperature ranges between in the summers. Winters in Varanasi see very large diurnal variations, with warm days and downright cold nights. Cold waves from the Himalayan region cause temperatures to dip across the city in the winter from December to February and temperatures below are not uncommon. The average annual rainfall is . Fog is common in the winters, while hot dry winds, called loo, blow in the summers. In recent years, the water level of the Ganges has decreased significantly; upstream dams, unregulated water extraction, and dwindling glacial sources due to global warming may be to blame.\n\nVaranasi division which consists of four districts, and is headed by the Divisional Commissioner of Varanasi, who is an IAS officer of high seniority, the Commissioner is the head of local government institutions (including Municipal Corporations) in the division, is in charge of infrastructure development in his division, and is also responsible for maintaining law and order in the division. The District Magistrate of Varanasi reports to the Divisional Commissioner. The current Commissioner is Nitin Ramesh Gokarn.\n\nVaranasi district administration is headed by the District Magistrate of Varanasi, who is an IAS officer. The DM is in charge of property records and revenue collection for the central government and oversees the elections held in the city. The DM is also responsible for maintaining law and order in the city, hence the SSP of Varanasi also reports to the DM of Varanasi. The DM is assisted by a Chief Development Officer (CDO), four Additional District Magistrates (ADM) (Finance/Revenue, City, Protocol, Executive), one Chief Revenue Officer (CRO), one City Magistrate (CM), and four Additional City Magistrates (ACM). The district has three tehsils, each headed by a Sub-Divisional magistrate. The current DM is Yogeshwar Ram Mishra.\n\nVaranasi district comes under the Varanasi Police Zone and Varanasi Police Range, Varanasi Zone is headed by an Additional Director General ranked IPS officer, and the Varanasi Range is headed Inspector General ranked IPS officer. The current ADG, Varanasi Zone is Biswajit Mahapatra, and IG, Varanasi Range is Deepak Ratan.\n\nThe district police is headed by a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), who is an IPS officer, and is assisted by six Superintendents of Police (SP)/Additional Superintendents of Police (Addl. SP) (City, Rural Area, Crime, Traffic, Protocol and Protocol), who are either IPS officers or PPS officers. Each of the several police circles is headed by a Circle Officer (CO) in the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police. The current SSP is Ram Krishna Bharadwaj.\n\nThe development of infrastructure in the city is overseen by Varanasi Development Authority (VDA), which comes under the Housing Department of Uttar Pradesh government. The Divisional Commissioner of Varanasi acts as the \"ex-officio\" Chairman of VDA, whereas a Vice Chairman, a government-appointed IAS officer, looks after the daily matters of the authority. The current Vice-Chairman of Varanasi Development Authority is Pulkit Khare.\n\nThe Varanasi Municipal Corporation oversees civic activities in the city, the head of the corporation is the Mayor, but the executive and administration of the corporation is the responsibility of the Municipal Commissioner, who is a Uttar Pradesh government-appointed either an IAS officer or Provincial Civil Service (PCS) officer of high seniority. The current Mayor of Varanasi is Mridula Jaiswal, whereas the Municipal Commissioner is Nitin Bansal.\n\nWater supply and sewage system is operated by the Uttar Pradesh Jal Nigam.\n\nVaranasi is represented in the Parliament of India by the current Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi who won the Lok Sabha elections in 2014 by a huge margin.\n\nHospitals in the city include the Sir Sunderlal Hospital, a teaching hospital in the Banaras Hindu University, Heritage Hospital, Marwari Hospital, Pitambari Hopspital, Mata Anand Mai Hospital, Rajkiya Hospital, Ram Krishna Mission Hospital, Shiv Prasad Gupta Hospital, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (managed by the state government), and Varanasi Hospital and Medical Research Centre. The urban parts of the Varanasi district had an infant mortality rate of 70 per 1,000 live births in 2010–2011.\n\nThe Railway Cancer Hospital is now being run by the Tata Memorial Centre after intervention by Prime Minister Narendra Modi who represents Varanasi. \n\nSushruta, an ancient Indian physician known as the primary author of the treatise \"Sushruta Samhita\", the Sanskrit text of surgery, lived in Varanasi and practised medicine and surgery sometime during the 5th century BCE. Since 1922, ayurveda has been a subject of training in the Banaras Hindu University, and in 1927 a separate Ayurvedic College was established. There are many ayurvedic centres in Varanasi providing treatments such as Panchakarma as well as other treatments.\n\nBecause of the high population density of Varanasi and the increasing number of tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.\n\nParts of Varanasi are contaminated with industrial chemicals including toxic heavy metal. Studies of wastewater from Varanasi's sewage treatment plants identify that water's contamination with metals and the reuse of this water for irrigation as a way that the toxic metals come to be in the plants that people grow for food. One studied example is \"palak\", a popular leafy vegetable which takes up heavy metal when it is in the soil, and which people then eat. Some of the polluting sludge contains minerals which are fertiliser, which could make polluted water attractive to use. Pesticides used in local farming are persistent enough to be spread through the water, to sewer treatment, then back to the farms as wastewater.\n\nVaranasi's water supply and sewage system is maintained by Jal Nigam, a subsidiary of Varanasi Nagar Nigam. Power supply is by the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited. The city produces about per day of sewage and per day of solid waste. The solid wastes are disposed in one landfill site.\n\nAccording to provisional data from the 2011 census, the Varanasi urban agglomeration had a population of 1,435,113, with 761,060 men and 674,053 women.\n\nThe population of the Varanasi urban agglomeration in 2001 was 1,371,749 with a ratio of 879 females every 1,000 males. However, the area under Varanasi Nagar Nigam has a population of 1,100,748 with a ratio of 883 females for every 1,000 males. The literacy rate in the urban agglomeration is 77% while that in the municipal corporation area is 78%. Approximately 138,000 people in the municipal area live in slums.\n\nAccording to the 2006 City Development Plan for Varanasi, approximately 29% of Varanasi's population is employed. Approximately 40% are employed in manufacturing, 26% work in trade and commerce, 19% work in other services, 8% work in transport and communication, 4% work in agriculture, 2% work in construction, and 2% are marginal workers (working for less than half of the year).\n\nAmong manufacturing workers, 51% work in spinning and weaving, 15% work in metal, 6% work in printing and publishing, 5% work in electrical machinery, and the rest work in a wide variety of industry sectors. Varanasi's manufacturing industry is not well developed and is dominated by small-scale industries and household production.\n\nSilk weaving is the dominant industry in Varanasi. Muslims are the influential community in this industry with nearly half a million of them working as weavers, dyers, sari finishers, and salespersons. Weaving is typically done within the household, and most weavers are Momin Ansari Muslims. Varanasi is known throughout India for its production of very fine silk and Banarasi saris, brocades with gold and silver thread work, which are often used for weddings and special occasions. The production of silk often uses bonded child labour, though perhaps not at a higher rate than elsewhere in India. The silk weaving industry has recently been threatened by the rise of power looms and computer-generated designs and by competition from Chinese silk imports.\n\nIn the metal manufacturing sector, Diesel Locomotive Works is a major employer. Bharat Heavy Electricals, a large power equipment manufacturer, also operates a heavy equipment maintenance plant. Other major commodities manufactured and traded in Varanasi include hand-knotted Mirzapur carpets, rugs, dhurries, brassware, copperware, wooden and clay toys, handicrafts, gold jewellery, and musical instruments. Important agricultural products include betel leaves (for paan), langra mangoes and khoa (solidified milk).\n\nTourism is Varanasi's second most important industry. Nearly 6.3 million domestic tourists and 690,472 foreign tourists visited Varanasi in 2015. Domestic tourist most commonly visit for religious purposes while foreign tourist visit for ghats along River Ganges and Sarnath. Most domestic tourists are from Bihar, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, while the majority of foreign tourists are from Sri Lanka and Japan. The peak tourist season falls between October and March. In total, there are around 12,000 beds available in the city, of which about one half are in inexpensive budget hotels and one third in dharamsalas. Overall, Varanasi's tourist infrastructure is not well developed.\nTrade Facilitation Centre is a modern and integerated facility to support handloom and handicraft sector in Varanasi; providing trade enhancement and facilitation to both domestic & international buyers. Hence, carrying forward the rich traditions of handlooms and handicrafts. \nThe prominent malls and multiplexes in Varanasi are JHV Mall in the Varanasi Cantonment area, IP Mall in Sigra, IP Vijaya Mall in Bhelupur, Vinayak Plaza in Maldhaiya and PDR in Luxa. The city has several banks, including the Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, Central Bank of India, Corporation Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, and State Bank of India.\n\nIn more modern times many of the exports from Varanasi are traded on a much smaller scale. Instead of reaching into the far markets of western Europe, dairy product exports and betel leaves reach closer markets. The trend towards local trading is beginning to change, however, as the Indian Railway has selected Varanasi to serve as a major factory center.\n\nA major concern for Varanasi in the face of increased tourism and industrialization are the transportation problems that plague the area. While the city itself is connected to other major metropolises through air transport, travel within the city limits still proves problematic. Rickshaws and Auto Rickshaws are still a common site of Varanasi streets, and while these modes of transportation are picturesque, they contribute to traffic jams and slow movement on city streets.\n\nApart from the 19 archaeological sites identified by the Archaeological Survey of India, some of the prominent places of interest are the Aghor Peeth, the Alamgir Mosque, the Ashoka Pillar, the Bharat Kala Bhavan (Art Museum), the Bharat Mata Mandir, the Central University for Tibetan Studies, the Dhanvantari Temple, the Durga Temple, the Jantar Mantar, the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple, the Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith, the Shri Vishwanath Temple on the BHU campus, the Ramnagar Fort, the Riverfront Ghats, the Tulsi Manas Temple.\n\nThe Jantar Mantar observatory, constructed in 1737, is located above the ghats along the Ganges, and is adjacent to the Manmandir and Dasaswamedh Ghats and near the palace of Jai Singh II of Jaipur. While less equipped than the observatories at Jaipur and Delhi, the Jantar Mantar has a unique equatorial sundial which is functional and allows measurements to be monitored and recorded by one person.\n\nThe Ramnagar Fort, located near the Ganges on its eastern bank and opposite the Tulsi Ghat, was built in the 18th century by Kashi Naresh Raja Balwant Singh with cream-coloured \"chunar\" sandstone. The fort is a typical example of the Mughal architecture with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. At present, the fort is in disrepair. The fort and its museum are the repository of the history of the kings of Benares. Cited as an \"eccentric\" museum, it contains a rare collection of American vintage cars, bejeweled sedan chairs, an impressive weaponry hall, and a rare astrological clock. In addition, manuscripts, especially religious writings, are housed in the Saraswati Bhawan which is a part of a museum within the fort. Many books illustrated in the Mughal miniature style are also part of the collections. Because of its scenic location on the banks of the Ganges, it is frequently used as an outdoor shooting location for films.\n\nThe Ghats in Varanasi are world-renowned embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions. The ghats are an integral complement to the Hindu concept of divinity represented in physical, metaphysical, and supernatural elements. Varanasi has at least 84 ghats, most of which are used for bathing by pilgrims and spiritually significant Hindu puja ceremony, while a few are used exclusively as Hindu cremation sites. Steps in the ghats lead to the banks of Ganges, including the Dashashwamedh Ghat, the Manikarnika Ghat, the Panchganga Ghat, and the Harishchandra Ghat, where Hindus cremate their dead. Many ghats are associated with Hindu legends and several are now privately owned.\n\nMany of the ghats were constructed under the patronage of the Marathas, Shindes (Scindias), Holkars, Bhonsles, and Peshwas. Most are bathing ghats, while others are used as cremation sites. A morning boat ride on the Ganges across the ghats is a popular tourist attraction. The extensive stretches of ghats in Varanasi enhance the riverfront with a multitude of shrines, temples, and palaces built \"tier on tier above the water's edge\".\n\nThe Dashashwamedh Ghat is the main and probably the oldest ghat of Varanasi located on the Ganges, close to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. It is believed that Brahma created this ghat to welcome Shiva and sacrificed ten horses during the \"Dasa-Ashwamedha yajna\" performed there. Above and adjacent to this ghat, there are also temples dedicated to Sulatankesvara, Brahmesvara, Varahesvara, Abhaya Vinayaka, Ganga (the Ganges), and Bandi Devi, which are all important pilgrimage sites. A group of priests perform \"Agni Pooja\" (Sanskrit :\"Worship of Fire\") daily in the evening at this ghat as a dedication to Shiva, Ganga, Surya (Sun), Agni (Fire), and the entire universe. Special aartis are held on Tuesdays and on religious festivals.\n\nThe Manikarnika Ghat is the Mahasmasana, the primary site for Hindu cremation in the city. Adjoining the ghat, there are raised platforms that are used for death anniversary rituals. According to a myth it is said that an earring of Shiva or his wife Sati fell here. Fourth-century Gupta period inscriptions mention this ghat. However, the current ghat as a permanent riverside embankment was built in 1302 and has been renovated at least three times throughout its existence.\nThe Jain Ghat : Varanasi is believed to birthplace of Suparshvanatha (7th tirthankara) and Parshvanatha (23rd tirthankara). The Jain Ghat or Bachraj Ghat is a Jain Ghat and has three Jain Temples located on the banks of the River. It is believed that the Jain Maharajas used to own these ghats. Bachraj Ghat has three Jain temples near the river's banks, and one them is a very ancient temple of Tirthankara Suparswanath.\n\nAmong the estimated 23,000 temples in Varanasi, the temples most popular for worship are: the Kashi Vishwanath Temple of Shiva; the Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple; and the Durga Temple, known for monkeys that reside in the large trees nearby.\n\n\n\nThere are 15 mosques of significant historical value in Varanasi. Of particular note are the Abdul Razzaq, Alamgir, Bibi Razia, Chaukhambha, Dhai Nim Kangore, Fatman, Ganje Shahada, Gyanavapi and Hazrat Sayyed Salar Masud Dargah. Many of these mosques were constructed from the components of the Hindu shrines which were destroyed under the auspices of subsequent Muslim invaders or rulers. The two well known mosques are the Gyanvapi Mosque and the Alamgir Mosque.\n\nThe Gyanvapi Mosque was built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1664 CE, after destroying a Hindu temple. \"Gyan Vapi\" (Sanskrit: \"the well of knowledge\"), the name of the mosque, is derived from a well of the same name located within the precincts of the mosque. The remains of an erstwhile temple can be seen in the foundation, the columns and at the rear part of the mosque The façade of the mosque is modelled partially on the Taj Mahal's entrance. The mosque is administered by the Anjuman Inthazamiya Masajid (AIM).\n\nThe Alamgiri Mosque was built in the 17th century by Aurangzeb over the ruins of a Hindu temple. The Hindu temple that was destroyed was dedicated to Vishnu, and had been built by Beni Madhur Rao Scindia, a Maratha chieftain. When emperor Aurangzeb had captured Banaras, he had ordered total destruction of all Hindu temples there. Aurangzeb then built a mosque over the ruins of this temple in 1669 and named it as Alamagir Mosque in the name of his own honorific title \"Alamgir\" which he had adopted after becoming the emperor of Mughal empire. The mosque is located at a prominent site above the Panchganga Ghat, which is a funerary ghat facing the Ganges. The mosque is architecturally a blend of Islamic and Hindu architecture, particularly because of the lower part of the walls of the mosque having been built fully with the remains of the Hindu temple. The mosque has high domes and minarets. Two of its minarets had been damaged; one minaret crashed killing a few people and the other minaret was officially brought down because of stability concerns. Non-Muslims are not allowed to enter the mosque. The mosque has a security cordon of a police force.\n\nShri Guru Ravidass Janam Asthan, at Sir Gobardhan is the ultimate place of pilgrimage or religious headquarters for followers of the Ravidassia religion. The foundation stone was laid on 14 June 1965 on \"Ashad Sankranti\" day at the birthplace of Ravidas. The temple was completed in 1994.\n\nSarnath is located 10 kilometres north-east of Varanasi near the confluence of the Ganges and the Varuna rivers in Uttar Pradesh, India. The deer park in Sarnath is where Gautama Buddha first taught the Dharma, and where the Buddhist Sangha came into existence through the enlightenment of Kondanna.\n\nThe city is mentioned by the Buddha as one of the four places of pilgrimage to which his devout followers should visit. It was also the site of the Buddha's Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which was his first teaching after attaining enlightenment, in which he taught the four noble truths and the teachings associated with it.\n\nRenowned Indian writers who have resided in the city were Kabir, Ravidas, and Tulsidas, who wrote much of his \"Ram Charit Manas\" here. Kulluka Bhatt wrote the best known account of \"Manusmriti\" in Varanasi in the 15th century, Later writers of the city have included Acharya Shukla, Baldev Upadhyaya, Bharatendu Harishchandra, Devaki Nandan Khatri, Hazari Prasad Dwivedi, Jaishankar Prasad, Kshetresa Chandra Chattopadhyaya, Sudama Pandey (Dhoomil), Vagish Shastri, and Vidya Niwas Mishra.\n\nSeveral newspapers and journals are or were published in Varanasi such as \"Varanasi Chandroday\" and its successor \"Kashivartaprakashika\", which became a weekly journal, first published on 1 June 1851. The main newspaper is \"Aj\", a Hindi-language nationalist newspaper first published in 1920. The newspaper was the bulwark of the Indian National Congress and is a major newspaper of Hindi northern India.\n\nVaranasi is a major centre of arts and designs. It is a producer of silks and brocades with gold and silver thread work, carpet weaving, wooden toys, bangles made of glass, ivory work, perfumes, artistic brass and copper ware and a variety of handicrafts. The cantonment graveyard of the British Raj is now the location of Varanasi's Arts and Crafts.\n\nNotable artists (musicians and dancers) and historians who are connected with the city include Bismillah Khan, Ravi Shankar, Girija Devi, Gopal Shankar Misra, Gopi Krishna, Kishan Maharaj, Lalmani Misra, N. Rajam, Siddheshwari Devi, Samta Prasad, and Sitara Devi.\n\nVaranasi's music tradition is traced to the Pauranic days. According to ancient legend, Shiva is credited with evolving music and dance forms. During the medieval era, Vaishnavism, a Bhakti movement, grew in popularity, and Varanasi became a thriving center for musicians such as Surdas, Kabir, Ravidas, Meera and Tulsidas. During the monarchic rule of Govind Chandra in the 16th century, the Dhrupad style of singing received royal patronage and led to other related forms of music such as Dhamar, Hori, and Chaturang. Presently the Dhrupad maestro Pandit Ritwik Sanyal from Varanasi is working for the revival of this art-music.\n\nIn recent times, Girija Devi, the native famous classical singer of thumris, was widely appreciated and respected for her musical renderings. Varanasi is also associated with many great instrumentalists such as Bismillah Khan and Ravi Shankar, the famous sitar player and musicologist who was given the highest civilian award of the country, the Bharat Ratna. Varanasi has joined the global bandwagon of UNESCO \"Cities of Music\" under the Creative Cities Network.\n\nOn Maha Shivaratri (February), a procession of Shiva proceeds from the Mahamrityunjaya Temple to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple. Dhrupad Mela is a five-day musical festival devoted to dhrupad style held at Tulsi Ghat in February–March. The Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple celebrates Hanuman Jayanti (March–April), the birthday of Hanuman. A special puja, aarti, and a public procession is organised. Since 1923, the temple has organised a five-day classical music and dance concert festival named \"Sankat Mochan Sangeet Samaroh\", wherein iconic artists from all parts of India are invited to perform.\n\nThe Ramlila of Ramnagar is a dramatic enactment of Rama's legend, as told in \"Ramacharitamanasa\". The plays, sponsored by Kashi Naresh, are performed in Ramnagar every evening for 31 days. On the last day, the festivities reach a crescendo as Rama vanquishes the demon king Ravana. Kashi Naresh Udit Narayan Singh started this tradition around 1830.\nNag Nathaiya is celebrated on the fourth lunar day of the dark fortnight of the Hindu month of Kartik (October–November). It commemorates the victory of Krishna over the serpent Kaliya. On this occasion, a large Kadamba tree (\"Neolamarckia cadamba\") branch is planted on the banks of the Ganges so that a boy, playing the role of Krishna, can jump into the river on to the effigy representing Kaliya. He stands over the effigy in a dancing pose playing the flute, while an audience watches from the banks of the river or from boats. \"Bharat Milap\" celebrates the meeting of Rama and his younger brother Bharata after the return of the former after 14 years of exile. It is celebrated during October–November, a day after the festival of Vijayadashami. Kashi Naresh attends this festival in his regal attire. The festival attracts a large number of devotees.\n\n\"Ganga Mahotsav\" is a five-day music festival organised by the Uttar Pradesh Tourism Department, held in November–December. It culminates a day before Kartik Purnima, also called the Ganges festival. On this occasion the Ganges is attended by thousands of pilgrims, release lighted lamps to float in the river from the ghats.\n\nThe primary Muslim festivals celebrated annually in the city are the ld-ul-fitr' (Ramzan), Bakrid, Mid-Sha'ban, Bara Wafat and Muharram. Additional festivals include Alvida and Chehlum. A non-religious festival observed by Muslims is Ghazi-miyan-ka-byaha (\"the marriage of Ghazi Miyan\").\n\nHistorically, Varanasi has been a centre for education in India, attracting students and scholars from across the country. Varanasi has an overall literacy rate of 80% (male literacy: 85%, female literacy: 75%). It is home to a number of colleges and universities. Most notably, it is the site of Banaras Hindu University (BHU), which is one of the largest residential universities in Asia with over 20,000 students. The Indian Institute of Technology (BHU) Varanasi is designated an Institute of National Importance and is one of 16 Indian Institutes of Technology. Other colleges and universities in Varanasi include Jamia-e-Imania, the Institute of Integrated Management and Technology, Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith, Nav Sadhana Kala Kendra, Sampurnanand Sanskrit University, Sri Agrasen Kanya P.G. College, and Udai Pratap Autonomous College. Various engineering colleges have been established in the outskirts of the city.\n\nVaranasi is also has 3 Kendriya Vidyalaya. Among them Kendriya Vidyalaya BHU holds the regional office of Varanasi Region of KVS and is seat of Deputy Commissioner. Kendriya Vidyalaya BHU is also accredited by the British Council. Other KVs are Kendriya Vidyalaya 39 GTC and Kendriya Vidyalaya DLW.St. Joseph's Convent School, in Shivpur, Varanasi, was established by the Sisters of Our Lady of Providence of France as a Catholic (Christian) minority institution with the approval of the Government of Uttar Pradesh. It is an autonomous organisation under the diocese of the Bishop of Varanasi. It provides education not only to the Catholic Christian children, but also to others who abide by its rules.\n\nAnother important institution is the Central Hindu School in Kamachha. This was established by Annie Besant in July 1898 with the objective of imparting secular education.

The overall \"state of education in Varanasi is ... not good.\" Schools in Varanasi vary widely in quality, with private schools outperforming government schools. In government schools, many teachers fail to come to class or to teach children. Some government schools lack basic equipment, such as blackboards and sufficient desks and chairs for all students. Private schools vary in quality, with the most expensive conducting lessons in English (seen as a key to children's success) and having computers in classrooms. Pupils attending the more expensive private schools, tended to come from upper-class families. Lower-cost private schools attracted children from lower-income families or those lower-income families with higher education aspirations. Government schools tend to serve lower-class children with lower education aspirations.\n\nBasketball, cricket, and field hockey are popular sports in Varanasi. The main stadium in the city is the Dr Sampurnanda Stadium (Sigra Stadium), where first-class cricket matches are held. Local cricket matches are also played on the BHU Ground, Dr. Bheeem Rao Sports Complex.\nThe Department of Physical Education, Faculty of Arts of BHU offers diploma courses in Sports Management, Sports Physiotherapy, Sports Psychology and Sports Journalism.\n\nGymnastics is also popular in Varanasi, and many Indian girls practice outdoors at the ghats in the mornings which hosts akhadas, where \"morning exercise, a dip in the Ganges and a visit to Lord Hanuman\" forms a daily ritual. Despite concerns regarding water quality, two swimming clubs offer swimming lessons in the Ganges.\n\nThe Varanasi District Chess Sports Association (VDCSA) is based in Varanasi, affiliated to the regional Uttar Pradesh Chess Sports Association (UPCSA).\n\nVaranasi is well-connected by air, rail and road. One of the major factors in Varanasi's is its access to all parts of the country. Within the city mobility is provided by taxis, rickshaws, cycle rickshaws and three wheelers, but with certain restrictions in the old town area of the city.\n\nVaranasi is served by Lal Bahadur Shastri International Airport, which is approximately from the city centre in Babatpur. The airport inaugurated a new terminal in 2010, and it was granted international airport status on 4 October 2012. Air India, Buddha Air, Jet Airways, IndiGo, Thai Smile, SriLankan Airlines and SpiceJet operate flights from Varanasi to Bangkok, Colombo, Delhi, Gaya, Kathmandu, Khajuraho, Sharjah, Yangon, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Goa and Kolkata. Over 1,916,454 passengers passed through the airport in 2016-17, making it the 21st busiest airport in India.\nVaranasi Junction, commonly known as Varanasi Cantt Railway Station, is the city's largest train station. More than 360,000 passengers and 240 trains pass through each day. Manduadih railway station is also a Terminal station of Varanasi. Because of huge rush at Varanasi Junction the railway developed the station as a high facilitated terminal.Varanasi City railway station is also one of the railway stations in Varanasi district. It is 4 km North-East of Varanasi Junction railway station. It serves as Terminal station because of heavy rush at Varanasi Junction. Mughalsarai Junction railway station is also the important station in Varanasi suburban. Some of the important express trains operating from the Varanasi Junction railway station and Manduadih railway station are: Shiv Ganga Express runs between New Delhi Junction and Manduadih station while Mahamana Express runs between Varanasi junction and New Delhi Junction; the Udhna Varanasi Express that runs between Udhna (Surat) junction and Varanasi, a distance of ; the Kashi Vishwanath Express that runs between Varanasi and New Delhi railway station; the Kanpur Varanasi InterCity express, also called Varuna express, which runs over a distance of and connects with Lucknow (the capital city of Uttar Pradesh) and Varanasi; and the Sabarmati Express which runs between Varanasi and Ahmedabad.\nVaranasi lies along National Highway 19 (old number: NH 2), which connects it to Kolkata, Kanpur, Agra, and Delhi. National Highway 28 connects Varanasi to the Nepal-India border. National Highway 31 connects Varanasi to Unnao.\n\nThe Government is executing seven road projects connecting Varanasi, the total project cost being Rs 7,100 crore and the total length of the project being 524 km.\nSome of the important projects are:\n\nAuto rickshaws are the most widely available forms of public transport in old city. In the outer regions of the city, buses are common, and taxis are available.\n\nThe Varanasi Metro is a rapid transit proposed for Varanasi. The proposed system consists of two lines, spanning from BHEL to Banaras Hindu University (19.35 km) and Benia Bagh to Sarnath (9.885 km). The feasibility study of the project was done by RITES and was completed in June 2015. Metro Rail is likely to be completed around 2020. There will be 26 stations, including 20 underground and six elevated on the two lines, which includes total length of 29.235 km consisting of 23.467 km underground, while 5.768 km will be elevated.\n\nThe total estimated completion cost for construction of Varanasi Metro is estimated to be Rs. 17,227 Crores, including taxes and duties. The project is envisaged to be undertaken as a joint venture (JV) project between the Government of India (GoI) and the Government of Uttar Pradesh (GoUP) with 50:50 equity partnerships. To maintain the financial viability of the project, additional grants have been proposed from the two governments in addition to their equity contribution.\n\nVaranasi is twinned with:\n\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n\n"}

Rev William Stubbs HFRSE (21 June 1825 – 22 April 1901) was an English historian and Anglican bishop. He was Regius Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford between 1866 and 1884. He was Bishop of Chester from 1884 to 1889 and Bishop of Oxford from 1889 to 1901.\n\nThe son of William Morley Stubbs, a solicitor, and his wife, Mary Ann Henlock, he was born in a house on the High Street in Knaresborough, Yorkshire, and was educated at Ripon Grammar School and Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated MA in 1848, obtaining a first-class in Literae Humaniores and a third in mathematics.\n\nStubbs was elected a Fellow of Trinity College, during his time living in Navestock, Essex, from 1850 to 1866, where he served as parish priest for the same period. \n\nIn 1859 he married Catherine Dellar, daughter of John Dellar, of Navestock, and they had several children. He was librarian at Lambeth Palace, and in 1862 was an unsuccessful candidate for the Chichele Professorship of Modern History at Oxford.\n\nIn 1866, Stubbs was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford, and held the chair until 1884. His lectures were thinly attended, and he found them a distraction from his historical work. Some of his statutory lectures are published in his \"Lectures on Mediaeval and Modern History\". In 1872, he founded Oxford University's School of Modern History, allowing postclassical history to be taught as a distinct subject for the first time. He accepted the patronage of the Stubbs Society during his time at Oxford, where he interacted with future doyens of the historical profession.\n\nStubbs was rector of Cholderton, Wiltshire, from 1875 to 1879, when he was appointed a canon of St Paul's Cathedral. He served on the ecclesiastical courts commission of 1881-1883 and wrote the weighty appendices to the report. On 25 April 1884 he was consecrated Bishop of Chester, and in 1889 became Bishop of Oxford until his death. As Bishop of Oxford he was also \"ex officio\" the Chancellor of the Order of the Garter. He was a Member of the Chetham Society, and served as Vice-President from 1884.\n\nStubbs was a High Churchman whose doctrines and practice were grounded on learning and a veneration for antiquity. His opinions were received with marked respect by his brother prelates, and he acted as an assessor to the archbishop in the trial of Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.\n\nAn attack of illness in November 1900 seriously impaired Stubbs' health. He was able, however, to attend the funeral of Queen Victoria on 2 February 1901, and preached a remarkable sermon before the king and the German emperor on the following day. His illness became critical on 20 April. He died in Cuddesdon on 22 April 1901. Stubbs was buried in the churchyard of All Saints, Cuddesdon, next to the palace of the bishops of Oxford.\n\nBoth in England and America Stubbs was universally acknowledged as the head of all English historical scholars, and no English historian of his time was held in equal honour in European countries. Among his many distinctions he was D.D. and honorary D.C.L. of Oxford, LL.D. of Cambridge and Edinburgh, Doctor \"in utroque jure\" of Heidelberg; an hon. member of the university of Kiev, and of the Prussian, Bavarian and Danish academies; he received the Prussian order \"Pour le Mérite\", and was corresponding member of the \"Académie des sciences morales et politiques\" of the French Institute. Stubbs was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1897.\n\nUntil Stubbs found it necessary to devote all his time to his episcopal duties, he concentrated on historical study. He argued that the theory of the unity and continuity of history should not remove distinctions between ancient and modern history. He believed that, though work on ancient history is a useful preparation for the study of modern history, either may advantageously be studied apart. He also believed that the effects of individual character and human nature will render generalizations vague and useless. While pointing out that history is useful as a mental discipline and a part of a liberal education, he recommended its study chiefly for its own sake. It was in this spirit that he worked; he had the faculty of judgment and a genius for minute and critical investigation. He was equally eminent in ecclesiastical history, as an editor of texts and as the historian of the British constitution.\n\nIn 1858 Stubbs published his \"Registrum sacrum anglicanum\", which sets forth episcopal succession in England, which was followed by many other later works, and particularly by his share in \"Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents\", edited in co-operation with the Rev. A. W. Haddan, for the third volume of which he was especially responsible. He edited nineteen volumes for the Rolls series of \"Chronicles and Memorials\".\n\nIt is, however, by Stubbs' \"Constitutional History of England\" (3 vols., 1874–78) that he is most widely known as a historian. It became at once the standard authority on its subject. The appearance of this book, which traces the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain till 1485, marks a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning. It was followed by its companion volume of \"Select Charters and Other Illustrations of English Constitutional History\".\n\nBy Stubbs' contemporaries and after his death Stubbs was considered to have been in the front rank of historical scholars both as an author and a critic, and as a master of every department of the historian's work, from the discovery of materials to the elaboration of well founded theories and literary production. He was a good palaeographer, and excelled in textual criticism, in examination of authorship, and other such matters, while his vast erudition and retentive memory made him second to none in interpretation and exposition. His merits as an author are often judged solely by his \"Constitutional History\".\n\nHowever, Stubbs' work is not entirely unquestionable. Some modern historians have questioned his acceptance of some medieval chronicles, written by monastical scribes whose views would be, to some extent, influenced by the politics of the Catholic Church. One such criticism was Stubbs' tirade against William Rufus whose character was much-maligned by the chroniclers perhaps due to his opposition to Gregorian reforms during his reign, which led to Archbishop Anselm going into exile.\n\nAmong the most notable examples of Stubbs' work for the Rolls series are the prefaces to Roger of Hoveden, the \"Gesta regum\" of William of Malmesbury, the \"Gesta Henrici II\", and the Memorials of St. Dunstan.\n\nIn the main Stubbs' ideas of a confrontational political framework have been superseded by K. B. McFarlane's 'community of interest' theory; the idea that the amount of possible conflict between a king and his nobles was actually very small (case in point, Henry IV, 1399–1413). Historians like Richard Partington, Rosemary Horrox and notably May McKisack, have pushed this view further.\n\nJ. W. Burrow proposed that Stubbs, like John Richard Green and Edward Augustus Freeman, was an historical scholar with little or no experience of public affairs, with views of the present which were romantically historicised and who was drawn to history by what was in a broad sense an antiquarian passion for the past, as well as a patriotic and populist impulse to identify the nation and its institutions as the collective subject of English history, making\nthe new historiography of early medieval times an extension, filling out and democratising, of older Whig notions of continuity. It was Stubbs who presented this most substantially; Green who made it popular and dramatic... It is in Freeman...of the three the most purely a narrative historian, that the strains are most apparent.'\n\n\n\n"}
