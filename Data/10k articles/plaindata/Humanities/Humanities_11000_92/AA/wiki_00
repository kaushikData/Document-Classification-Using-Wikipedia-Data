He is known primarily for his scholarly work on \"Beowulf\" and his translation of Snorri Sturluson's \"Prose Edda\" for The American-Scandinavian Foundation, but also as a writer of pulp fiction and for his left-wing politics.\n\nBrodeur was born in Franklin, Massachusetts, to Clarence Arthur Brodeur, a private school teacher who served as Superintendent of Schools at Warren and Chicopee, and to Mary Cornelia (\"née\" Latta). He earned Bachelor's, Master's, and Doctoral degrees at Harvard University in 1909, 1911, and 1916, with a dissertation on the \"topos\" of the grateful lion in medieval literature.\n\nWhile a student, Brodeur taught German and history in a boys' school and was a visiting lecturer at the University of Oregon. However, the bulk of his career was spent at the University of California in Berkeley, where he started in 1916 as an instructor in English and Germanic philology, became a full professor in 1930, and remained until retiring in 1955. He was chairman of the special committee on professionalizing the University of California Press in 1932. After retiring from the University of California, he returned to the University of Oregon. In 1959, he published \"The Art of Beowulf\", which has been called \"one of the books that any student of the poem must read.\"\n\nBrodeur was active in the establishment of the Department of Scandinavian Studies at the University of California, and served as its first chairman from 1946 until 1951. He had already been translating Old Norse for the American-Scandinavian Society before completing his doctorate. His translation of the \"Prose Edda\" by Snorri Sturluson appeared the same year as he was awarded the degree. In 1944, he was declared a Knight 1st Class of the Royal Order of Vasa for his services to Scandinavian studies.\n\nIn connection with his interest in ballads, Brodeur was active in folklore studies.\n\nEarly in his career, Brodeur wrote and co-wrote fiction for the popular magazines \"Argosy\" and \"Adventure\". Many stories focused on topics of Northern history and legend, such as Harald Hardrada's time in the Varangian Guard (the serialized novel \"He Rules Who Can\", 1928) and \"Völsunga saga\" (the novella \"Vengeance,\" 1925). With Farnham Bishop, he wrote adventure stories starring Lady Fulvia, and the novel \"The Altar of the Legion\" (1926).\n\nBrodeur was also known for his progressive politics. He was on the committee organizing fund-raising for Arthur J. Kraus' appeal against his dismissal by the City College of New York. Gordon Griffiths wrote in his memoir that Brodeur, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Haakon Chevalier were the sole members of the Berkeley Communist faculty group in the early 1940s. Brodeur was one of the University of California faculty who refused to sign the loyalty oath as required by the state in 1949, although he ultimately did decide to sign and continue the fight from within.\n\n\n\n"}

Major books by Quarles include \"The Negro in the Civil War\" (1953), \"The Negro in the American Revolution\" (1961), \"Lincoln and the Negro\" (1962), and \"Black Abolitionists\" (1969). He demonstrated that blacks were active participants in major conflicts and issues of American history. His books were narrative accounts of critical wartime periods that focused on how blacks interacted with their white allies and emphasized blacks' acting as vital agents of change rather than receiving favors from whites.\n\nQuarles was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1904. His parents were Margaret (O'Brien), a homemaker, and Arthur Benedict Quarles, a subway porter. As a boy, Benjamin went to local public schools.\n\nIn his twenties, Quarles enrolled at Shaw University, a historically black college in Raleigh, North Carolina, and received his B.A. degree in 1931. He earned his M.A. degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1933, and Ph.D. from there in 1940. Initially he faced resistance for wanting to write black history but finally received support for his goal. He learned his writing style from Professor William Hesseltine.\n\nHe returned to Shaw, working as an instructor of history (1935–39). He next taught at Dillard University (1939–1953) in New Orleans, Louisiana. There he became a full professor and also served as dean. His last appointment was as professor of history and chair of the department at Morgan State University, Baltimore, Maryland (1953–1974). At Morgan, Quarles reached near-legendary status as the long-time head of the History Department. He was a revered teacher and counselor, an intellectual and professional mentor for two generations of African-American scholars. Many of his books became required reading in the African-American history courses that were developed in American universities during the 1960s. This movement was inspired both by the civil rights movement and increasing scholarly interest in the history of minorities and women. After Quarles's official retirement in 1969, he was awarded professor \"emeritus\" status and kept teaching for several years.\n\nQuarles was an active member of many political and historical organizations, such as Project Advisory Committee on Black Congress Members, the committee to oversee the founding of the Amistad Center at Tulane University, the Department of the Army Historical Advisory Committee, and the American Council of Learned Societies. He was one of the few men in the profession who openly supported the founding of the Association of Black Women Historians.\n\nA prolific writer, Benjamin Quarles published ten books, 23 articles, and hundreds of shorter pieces of various sorts. In his writings, he focused on exploring in detail the contributions made by the black soldiers and abolitionists of the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), and the American Civil War (1861-1865). His essays in the \"Mississippi Valley Historical Review\" in 1945 and 1959 were the first from a Black historian to be published in a major historical journal.\n\nHis books include:\n\nQuarles died in 1996 of a heart attack at the age of 92.\n\n\n"}

In this sense, in some countries which use a Westminster system of government, the caretaker government is simply the incumbent government, which continues to operate in the interim period between the normal dissolution of parliament for the purpose of holding an election and the formation of a new government after the election results are known. Unlike in ordinary times, the caretaker government's activities are limited by custom and convention.\n\nIn systems where coalition governments are frequent a caretaker government may be installed temporarily while negotiations to form a new coalition take place. This usually occurs either immediately after an election in which there is no clear victor or if one coalition government collapses and a new one must be negotiated. Caretaker governments are expected to handle daily issues and prepare budgets for discussion, but are not expected to produce a government platform or introduce controversial bills.\n\nA caretaker government is often set up following a war until stable democratic rule can be restored, or installed, in which case it is often referred to as a provisional government.\n\nMany countries are administered by a caretaker government during election periods, such as:\nOther countries that use similar mechanisms include Pakistan and New Zealand.\n\nHeads of caretaker governments are often referred to as a \"caretaker\" head, for example \"caretaker prime minister\".\n\nSimilarly, but chiefly in the United States, caretakers are individuals who fill seats in government temporarily without ambitions to continue to hold office on their own. This is particularly true with regard to United States Senators who are appointed to office by the Governor of their state following a vacancy created by the death or resignation of a sitting senator. Sometimes governors wish to run for the seat themselves in the next election but do not want to be accused of unfairness by arranging their own appointments in the interim. Also, sometimes they do not wish to be seen as taking sides within a group of party factions or prejudicing of a primary election by picking someone who is apt to become an active candidate for the position. At one time, widows of politicians were often selected as caretakers to succeed their late husbands; this custom is rarely exercised today, as it could be viewed by some as nepotism.\n\nIn a similar vein, Nelson Rockefeller was said to be a \"caretaker\" Vice President of the United States (1974–1977). He was nominated for the office by President Gerald Ford, who had succeeded the resigned President Richard Nixon. Rockefeller made it apparent that he had no further presidential ambitions of his own (unlike many Vice Presidents), despite having run for the office three times in the past, and he had no intention of even running for a full term in the vice presidential office. He followed through on his intention when Ford's running mate in the 1976 presidential election was Senator Bob Dole.\n\nIn Canada and most other English-speaking countries, the more widely accepted term in this context is \"interim\", as in interim leader. In Italy this kind of premier is the President of Government of Experts.\n\nThe following is a list of individuals who have been considered caretaker (or provisional or interim) heads of state or heads of government:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3770720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3770720", "title": "Criticism of the Pledge of Allegiance", "text": "Criticism of the Pledge of Allegiance\n\nThe Pledge of Allegiance of the United States has been criticized on several grounds. Its use in government funded schools has been the most controversial, as critics contend that a government-sanctioned endorsement of religion violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Arguments against the pledge include that the pledge itself is incompatible with democracy and freedom, pledges of allegiance are features of totalitarian states such as Nazi Germany, and that the pledge was written to honor Christopher Columbus and to sell flags.\n\nEven before the addition of the phrase \"under God\" in 1954, legal challenges were frequently founded on the basis of freedom of religion.\n\nCentral to early challenges were Jehovah's Witnesses, a group whose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power lesser than God. In the 1940 Supreme Court case \"Minersville School District vs. Gobitis\", an 8–1 majority in the Court held that a school district's interest in promoting national unity permitted it to require Witness students to recite the Pledge along with their class mates. \"Gobitis\" was an unpopular decision in the press, and it led to a rash of mob violence and intimidation against Jehovah's Witnesses;\nthree years later in \"West Virginia State Board of Education vs. Barnette,\" the Court reversed itself, voting 6–3 to \"forbid\" a school from requiring the Pledge.\n\nAs a result, since 1943 public schools have been disallowed from punishing students for not reciting the Pledge. Nonetheless, it remains taught to and expected of school children in many schools, as the Court leaves many details in such matters up to respective state governments.\n\nMore specific objections have been raised since the addition of the phrase \"under God\" to the Pledge. The year of its addition, 1954, was also near the beginning of the Cold War anti-communist movement in the United States.\n\nIn response to the June 14, 1954 Congressional change of the wording of the Pledge (found in U.S. Code, tit. 36 § 172) to include \"under God\", a series of lawsuits were filed in the New York State courts by Joseph L. Lewis challenging the constitutionality of the addition of the new phrase. Lewis was a publisher, writer, and co-founder of Freethinkers of America. As the cases involved Joseph Lewis desiring the Court to order the Commissioner of Education of The State of New York, James E. Allen, Jr. to remove the new words from the Pledge, these cases are referred to as the \"Matter of Lewis v. Allen\".\n\nThe first case brought by Lewis found its way to the New York State Supreme Court in 1957. Joseph Lewis maintained that the Commissioner of Education of the State of New York had a duty, which he had failed to perform, to revoke the regulation requiring the recitation of the Pledge with the new phrase, and reinstate the old wording. Lewis did not cite any state regulations concerning the Commissioner, but held the Commissioner was bound to act by the U.S. First Amendment (which was applied to the State governments through the Fourteenth Amendment) and by article I and XI of the New York State Constitution.\n\nThe court held that it was not within the Commissioner's domain to determine the constitutionality of acts performed by the State or Federal Legislatures. The Court then turned to Lewis' contention that the New York law that ordered the recitation of the Pledge had been rendered unconstitutional by the new wording, \"Petitioners claim that freethinkers, nonbelievers, atheists and agnostics cannot be compelled to recite the present pledge of allegiance because it includes the words 'under God', and such compulsion violates the aforesaid constitutional provisions.\"\n\nReferencing the 1943 case \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\" which resulted in fines and threats of imprisonment against those refusing to say the pledge being ruled unconstitutional, the Court held that \"The regulation under attack here has no compulsory aspect. No penalties attach to a failure or refusal to recite the pledge.The pledge is made voluntarily and no penalties are imposed for noncompliance.\"\n\nHaving pointed out that neither threats nor actual imprisonment or deprivation of property had made for noncompliance, the Court moved onto the other half of the definition of \"establishment\" set out in Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson's concurring opinion in \"McCollum v. Board of Education\". New York State Justice Isadore Bookstein wrote \"If I properly apprehend the intent, design and purposes of the First Amendment, it was conceived to prevent and prohibit the establishment of a \"State Religion\"; it was not intended to prevent or prohibit the growth and development of a \"Religious State\".\"\n\nOperating on the interpretation of the First Amendment that holds that the state is prohibited from establishing a single religion or denomination as the official religion, but is free to support all religions in general (as long as it shows none of them preference above the others), Justice Bookstein listed several examples felt to support that interpretation. These included Supreme Court rulings such as the 1892 \"Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States\" which stated \"this is a religious nation\", and the 1952 ruling \"Zorach v. Clauson\" which stated \"We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.\" Bookstein also cited wording in the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburg Address, and the preamble of the New York Constitution which expressed gratitude \"to Almighty God for our Freedom\". In addition the Justice pointed out that American coins had \"In God we trust\" inscribed on them (a practice that had been implemented sporadically since 1864), and pointed to the Presidential oath of \"So help me, God\" (he made no mention that the Constitution gives the president-elect the option to affirm without invoking a deity).\n\nBookstein wrote \"If petitioners' contention be sound, it may be wondered whether the public school curriculum might properly include the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address. Could \"America\" (\"Protect us by thy might, Great God, our King!\") be sung in a public school without offending the First Amendment? And might not the presidential oath of office have questionable constitutional status?\"\n\nThe Justice held with House Report No. 1693 that the \"Zorach v. Clauson\" case \"clearly indicated that the references to the Almighty which run through our laws, our public rituals, and our ceremonies in no way flout the provisions of the First Amendment. ... [for] if this recognition of the Almighty was not so, then even a fastidious atheist or agnostic could object to the way in which the Court itself opens each of its sessions, namely, 'God save the United States and the Honorable Court'.\"\n\nBookstein held that \"the child of a nonbeliever may simply omit the words, 'under God', in reciting the pledge. His 'non-conformity', if such it be, will not, in the circumstances of this case, set him apart from his fellow students or bring 'pressure' to bear in any real sense.\" Bookstein again cited \"Zorach v. Clauson\" holding that to side with Lewis' claims against the government would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do not'. The First Amendment does not require this.\"\n\nJustice Bookstein's words in this ruling were later quoted by the state of New York in one of its briefs, when defending its position in the \"Engel v. Vitale\" case before the United States Supreme Court.\n\nLewis brought a similar argument in 1960 holding that the Pledge with the new words was unconstitutional \"as it involves 'the use of the public schools—both physically and pedagogically—for the dissemination of purely religious dogma' and, second, as it imposes 'an intolerable degree of compulsion upon the young children of non-believers ... to listen to, learn and repeat thousands of time a religious concept which they repudiate and abhor.\n\nThe Court cited New York's recent decision in the case \"Engles v. Vitale\" where the state had allowed officials of a school district to order its teachers to teach and lead students in a nondenominational prayer crafted by the government to remain in place as long as more safeguards were put into place to insure that students and parents were informed that children could remove themselves from the classroom if they did not wish to participate or be exposed to the prayer crafted by the New York board of Regents (this decision was later reversed by the United States Supreme court in 1963). The New York Court held that due to the 1943 case \"West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette\" there was general knowledge that there could be no compulsion on students to participate or expose themselves to the Pledge.\n\nThe Court dismissed Lewis' claims that the pledge was an establishment of religion citing \"Zorach v. Clauson\", \"There cannot be the slightest doubt that the First Amendment reflect the philosophy that Church and State should be separated. ... The First Amendment, however, does not say that in every and all respects there shall be a separation of Church and State. Rather, it studiously defines the manner, the specific ways, in which there shall be no concert or union or dependency one on the other. That is the common sense of the matter. Otherwise the state and religion would be aliens to each other—hostile, suspicious, and even unfriendly. ... Prayers in our legislative halls; the appeals to the Almighty that run through our laws, our public rituals, our ceremonies would be flouting the First Amendment.\"\n\nThe court also dismissed Lewis' argument that the Pledge violated New York's Constitution that forbids the use of public money or other property in aid of any denominational school or any school' in which any denominational tenet or doctrine is taught\". Stating simply \"From our determination that the claim of unconstitutionality under the First Amendment cannot be sustained, it follows that the regulation does not contravene the like provisions of the State Constitution.\"\n\nLewis appealed this decision to the New York Court of Appeals in 1964, they affirmed the previous decision which ruled against his position.\n\nThe use of the Pledge of Allegiance has been cited in landmark cases concerning government led prayer within public schools. These decisions, made in the 1960s, were often seen suspiciously as they occurred during the Cold War against the USSR which was officially atheistic. In addition, many Southern politicians saw these rulings, along with the concurrent decisions advancing racial Civil Rights, as an assault on State's Rights.\n\nIn 1962 the United States Supreme Court addressed the question of whether a government led school prayer \"to be said in conjunction with the Pledge of Allegiance and 'as an incident to the Pledge of Allegiance ceremony was constitutional in the case \"Engel v. Vitale\".\n\nIn the state's briefs, \"the insertion of the words 'under God' in the Pledge of Allegiance\" was cited as one of the \"literally countless illustrations ... [to] the fact that belief and trust in a Supreme Being was from the beginning and has been continuously part of the very essence of the American plan of government\".\n\nIn part, the state of New York defended the prayer by equating its effects with the Pledge, saying in one of their briefs \"The Regents' Prayer ... serves as a simple reminder that Americans trust in God, as the Pledge of Allegiance serves as a simple reminder of our obligations to our 'one nation under God'.\" They pointed out that \"The challenged recitation follows the pledge of allegiance, which itself refers to God\", and held that if the court outlawed the government-crafted prayer due to \"the conscientious objections of the minority\" that \"Such a determination would require not only that the Regents' Prayer be discontinued, but also that all schools cease the voluntary recitation of the pledge of allegiance, which, as amended by 36 U.S.C. §172, contains the words 'under God'.\"\n\nThe Court ruled that government-crafted and led prayer was unconstitutional. The decision was highly controversial, and \"obiter dictum\" within Justice William O. Douglas' concurring opinion received particular attention.\n\nIn his \"obiter dictum\", Douglas postulated what the reasoning of the ruling might have on current government practices. He wrote: \"The point for decision is whether the Government can constitutionally finance a religious exercise. Our system at the federal and state levels is presently honeycombed with such financing. Nevertheless, I think it is an unconstitutional undertaking whatever form it takes.\" In a footnote illustrating \"such financing\", he also noted that \"The slogan 'In God We Trust' is used by the Treasury Department, and Congress recently added God to the pledge of allegiance\", thereby calling those practices' constitutionality under question as well.\n\nOpponents of the decision (including legislators calling for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to reverse its effects) saw Douglas' \"obiter dictum\" as a likely indicator of future decisions including the end of daily recitals of the Pledge in schools.\n\nSenator Absalom Willis Robertson berated the decision and declared \"We have no clear assurance that the Court will not follow the broad concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas in rendering future decisions. That is why I say we cannot sit complacently\".\n\nSenator Herman Talmadge asked Robertson, \"[Can you theorize] If they did what their decision presages? It would remove all the chaplains in the armed services, the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, the word 'God' in \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", and everything else that the American Republic has held dear throughout the history of our country.\" To which Robertson replied \"That is the clear implication of the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas.\"\n\nSenator Wayne Morse, despite coming to an acceptance of the ruling, expressed concern if Douglas' dicta did not indicate a coming end to many practices within the government including the Pledge, saying \"Undoubtedly the special concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Douglas will have some persuasive influence not only on practicing lawyers, but also on lower courts. ... [Still, as it is only \"dicta\"] what Mr. Justice Douglas said in many parts of the decision does not involve principles and tenets which are yet the law of the land.\"\n\nWhile the move to amend the Constitution to reverse the effects of \"Engel v. Vitale\" did not get out of the Congressional Judiciary Committees, and the calls to impeach the Justices or to establish a \"Court of the States\" (that would allow representatives of the states to act as a court above the Supreme Court) failed to gather support, another school prayer case came before the Court in 1963. The Court was asked to rule on practices in the states of Pennsylvania and Maryland.\n\nIn this case, called \"Abington School District v. Schempp\", the Court considered whether school officials could read aloud or have students read aloud Bible passages for devotional purposes which \"was followed by a standing recitation of the Lord's Prayer, together with the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag by the class in unison\". The Court ruled against the state, but avoided saying anything similar to the highly controversial dicta Justice Douglas had previous written.\n\nThe decision did specifically mention the Pledge at several points. The Court theorized that the Pledge might be constitutional if either the words \"under God\" inserted in 1954 had, due to the passage of time, lost their religious meaning by 1963, or if one equated a personal public declaration of loyalty with the act of reading a document created by a historical figure—\"This general principle might also serve to insulate the various patriotic exercises and activities used in the public schools and elsewhere which, whatever may have been their origins, no longer have a religious purpose or meaning. The reference to divinity in the revised pledge of allegiance, for example, may merely recognize the historical fact that our Nation was believed to have been founded 'under God'. Thus reciting the pledge may be no more of a religious exercise than the reading aloud of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, which contains an allusion to the same historical fact.\"\n\nWith this reasoning the Supreme Court specifically categorized the Pledge as secular, contrasting it to the religious exercises under consideration. The Court held that if, as the states claimed, Bible reading and \"The Lord's Prayer\" were being used to achieve secular ends (\"fostering harmony and tolerance among the pupils\") than \"it would seem that less sensitive materials might equally well serve the same purpose. ... It has not been shown that readings from the speeches and messages of great Americans, for example, or from the documents of our heritage of liberty, daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, or even the observance of a moment of reverent silence at the opening of class, may not adequately serve the solely secular purposes of the devotional activities without jeopardizing either the religious liberties of any members of the community or the proper degree of separation between the spheres of religion and government. Such substitutes would, I think, be unsatisfactory or inadequate only to the extent that the present activities do in fact serve religious goals. While I do not question the judgment of experienced educators that the challenged practices may well achieve valuable secular ends, it seems to me that the State acts unconstitutionally if it either sets about to attain even indirectly religious ends by religious means, or if it uses religious means to serve secular ends where secular means would suffice.\"\n\nAs Justice Douglas' \"obiter dictum\" had included questioning the constitutionality of the fact that \"There is Bible-reading in the schools of the District of Columbia\" the controversy over the Court's rulings did not die out.\n\nOn June 17, 1963, the same day that the \"Schempp\" case was decided, A. L. Wirin, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit on behalf of Haswell Parker, a fifty-one-year-old high school history teacher. Parker, who \"said he did not belong to any church\", objected \"as a matter of personal conscience\" to the Los Angeles Board of Education's policy (instated in 1959) that made daily recitation of the pledge with the 1954 addition of the words \"under God\" mandatory.\n\nThis action was decried by both the media and politicians, such as Alan H. Newcomb of WBT-TC who was cited by Senator Sam Ervin, he stated \"almost before that opinion [\"Schempp\"] was understood by the people, the Civil Liberties Union brought suit ... We suggest that the history teacher study his history. The trend toward eradicating all reference to God from every official document and act in this country is not merely protecting a few tiny minorities from a fancied infringement of their rights. It goes far deeper than that. If carried to the ultimate conclusion, it would destroy the whole American philosophy of human liberty.\"\n\nThe constitutionality of the Pledge was not challenged in 1963 as the Los Angeles Board of Education \"advised the court it will not require Parker to lead the pledge of allegiance\". Parker and Wirin dropped the suit on October 4, 1963.\n\nTeachers or any other staff also cannot be forced to participate in the pledge. In the case of \"Lane v. Owens\", three teachers and six students sued the Colorado state government over a 2003 law requiring daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance by students and teachers. Granting the plaintiffs a temporary restraining order, U.S. District Judge Lewis Babcock said: \"It doesn't matter whether you're a teacher, a student, a citizen, an administrator, or anyone else, it is beyond the power of the authority of government to compel the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance\". Colorado subsequently (2004) amended the law to remove the requirement to recite the Pledge.\n\nIn early 2005, Dr. Michael Newdow brought a new lawsuit on behalf of himself and others. On September 14, 2005, U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled that it violated the Establishment Clause for public schools to lead their students in the Pledge of Allegiance to comply with California's requiring the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. The judge said he was bound by 2002 precedent of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision even though it had been vacated by the Supreme Court. Judge Karlton held that the words \"one nation under God\" violate the right to be \"free from a coercive requirement to affirm God\".\n\nOn November 30, 2005, the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, an organization claiming to defend religious rights for people of all faiths, appealed the case to the Ninth Circuit and filed a brief that declared, object to the ruling that the pledge violates any part of the Establishment Clause.\" Derek Gaubatz, Director of Litigation for the Becket Fund, said his group would appeal the decision \"if necessary to the Supreme Court to get that ruling reversed to secure the constitutionality of the pledge once and for all\".\n\nThe words \"under God\" were added to the Pledge on June 14, 1954 when then U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a bill into law. At the time, Eisenhower stated that \"From this day forward, the millions of our school children will daily proclaim in every city and town, every village and rural schoolhouse, the dedication of our Nation and our people to the Almighty.\"\n\nThe matter of the Pledge's constitutionality simmered for decades below the public eye. In 1992, the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decided the first challenge to the constitutionality of the words \"under God\", ruling in \"Sherman v. Community Consolidated School District 21\" that the use of the words \"under God\" in the Pledge did not violate the Establishment Clause. On June 26, 2002, in a case (\"Newdow v. United States Congress\") brought by an atheist father objecting to the Pledge being taught in his daughter's school, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled the addition of \"under God\" an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism.\n\nShortly after the ruling's release, Judge Alfred T. Goodwin, author of the opinion in the 2–1 ruling, signed an order staying its enforcement until the full Ninth Circuit court could decide whether to hear an appeal.\n\nThe day after the ruling, the Senate voted in favor of the Pledge as it stood. The House followed suit, accepting a similar resolution. The Senate vote was 99–0 (Senator Jesse Helms could not attend, but had been expected to vote \"yes\"); the House 416–3 with 11 abstaining. President George W. Bush and many other politicians spoke out in favor of the existing Pledge.\n\nThe stay on the ruling was lifted on February 28, 2003 when the full Ninth Circuit court of appeals decided not to take the case, letting the ruling stand. A second stay was granted, however, to give the school district time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If it had held, the court's ruling would have affected more than 9.6 million students in Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Guam.\n\nIn the months following the court's decision, Attorneys General from all 50 states filed papers asking the Supreme Court of the United States to review the decision, 49 of whom joined a legal brief sponsored by Oklahoma Attorney General Drew Edmondson and Idaho Attorney General Lawrence Wasden. California filed a separate brief, also urging the Supreme Court to hear the case.\n\nOn January 12, 2004, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal on March 24 of the same year. Justice Antonin Scalia recused himself from the case after he had criticized the Ninth Circuit judgment in the Newdow case.\nOn June 14, 2004, the Supreme Court rejected Newdow's claim by an 8–0 vote, stating that as a non-custodial parent, he did not have standing to act as his daughter's legal representative.\n\nIn August 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held 3–0 in Myers v. Loudoun County Public Schools that teacher-led recitations of the Pledge did not violate the Establishment Clause. The Plaintiff in that case, Edward Myers, decided not to appeal the case to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe points-of-view, compromises, and personal interests in this matter are often viewed as examples of a wider debate over the role of religion in U.S. government.\n\nSeveral dissenting Supreme Court Justices concluded that U.S. judges exceed their authority in decisions on issues of religion. Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia wrote, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist agreed, that \"the Court's position is the repressive one\" when the Supreme Court approved of the lower courts declaring a law unconstitutional because it mandated that teaching of \"evolution science\" be balanced by teaching of \"creation science.\" (\"Edwards v. Aguillard\",). Justice Scalia has also said that courts have gone too far to keep religion out of public schools and other forums, and that the Pledge of Allegiance question would be better decided by lawmakers than judges. \n\nThe Supreme Court has banned some expressions of \"God\" from public schools. For example, in 1962 the Supreme Court banned the teacher-led recitation of the invocation, \"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country.\" This objectionable \"Almighty God\" recitation was voluntary, of the same nature as the Pledge of Allegiance.\nIn the same 1962 case, the Court admitted that the \"God save this honorable court\" invocation uttered at the beginning of each Court session was a \"prayer.\" However, the Court also ruled that \"A religion is not established in the usual sense merely by letting those who choose to do so say the prayer that the public school teacher leads.\" Rather, the Court found fault with the teacher-led prayer because the State of New York had financed a religious exercise in requiring the teacher-led recitation of the prayer. Nevertheless, neither the parents nor the Court made the same assertion regarding the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nThe dissenting justice in the 2002 \"Under God\" ruling stated that the ruling conflicted with the Supreme Court's explicit stance that the phrase \"under God\" is merely a ceremonial reference to history and not an affirmation of religious faith. Opponents contend that this contradicts the 1954 House Report of the legislators who inserted the \"under God\" phrase into the Pledge, which stated that the words \"under God\" served to \"acknowledge the dependence of our people and our Government upon the moral directions of the Creator.\" 154 U.S.C.A.A.N 2339, 2340.\n\nThe plaintiff, Michael Newdow, an atheist, took issue with the phrase \"In God We Trust\" on the coins of American currency, believing that the phrase was a state-sponsored statement of religious faith—illegal under the separation of church and state. He argued that he had a right to raise his daughter \"without God being imposed into her life by her schoolteachers.\"\n\nSome of the judges in the 2002 ruling agreed that Newdow had a right to direct the religious education of his daughter. Newdow explained his view of 'freedom of religious exercise' by asking whether Christians would be glad if the atheists were in the majority and if the atheists inserted into the pledge of allegiance the phrase \"one nation under NO God.\" In an interview with Connie Chung, Newdow stated, \"The Constitution says the congress will make no laws respecting an establishment of religion which means that the Supreme Court says, and as you have said, nobody should be made to feel like an outsider. And I would only ask everyone of those people to ask themselves, if they had to say every morning when they pledged allegiance to the flag, that we were one nation under Sun Myung Moon, or one nation under David Koresh, or one nation under Jesus, or one nation under Mohammad, how would they feel?\" Thus Newdow claimed that the reference to God is meaningful, and hence the court should recognize, and correct, the resulting religious bias.\n\nFrancis Bellamy, the author of the Pledge, was a former Baptist minister who preached that Jesus was a socialist. He was allied ideologically with his cousin, Edward Bellamy, one of the most renowned socialists of the late 19th century. Strongly opposed to capitalism, Francis advocated income taxation, central banking, nationalized education, nationalization of industry, and other tenets of socialism. A primary objective of his was to replace the existing federalist view of the country (where states are sovereign) in the public's mind with a nationalist one that would open the way to creating a centralized government.\n\nWhen provided the opportunity to write a pledge to the American flag in a campaign to sell flags to public schools, Bellamy turned to the words and principles of socialism. Put simply, if American youth could to be taught \"loyalty to the State\", it would pave the way for the socialist utopia that was described in his famous socialist cousin Edward Bellamy's \"Looking Backward\". The central idea of \"one nation\" in the pledge was especially important for achieving his vision of the kind of consolidated, monopoly government necessary for a socialism to be adopted. Additionally, he considered adding the socialist bywords, \"liberty, fraternity and equality\", but knew that state superintendents of education on his committee were against equality for women and African Americans.\n\nAs Bellamy believed youth should be trained in devotion to the State, the public schools as a government institution were the perfect setting for planting the requisite fervent loyalty and patriotism. To promote the Pledge nationwide, a \"National Public School Celebration\" was held 1892 on Columbus Day. It was the first government sponsored propaganda event on behalf of the Pledge of Allegiance. It was a massive campaign that involved government schools and politicians throughout the country. Not only was the Pledge recited \"en masse\" for the first time at the behest of government, but public schools were promoted while private schools, especially parochial ones, were criticized.\n\nSome people generally oppose the pledge because they feel that the mandatory recital of what amounts to an oath, particularly by children, led by government employees in public schools, is a form of compulsory speech, amounting to indoctrination, that is the antithesis of the liberty the flag itself represents. Indeed, in \"Barnette\", Justices Black and Douglas wrote in a concurring opinion, \"Words uttered under coercion are proof of loyalty to nothing but self-interest. Love of country must spring from willing hearts and free minds, inspired by a fair administration of wise laws enacted by the people's elected representatives within the bounds of express constitutional prohibitions.\" Likewise, the majority opinion by Justice Robert Jackson, included one of the great statements in American constitutional law and history, stated: \"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\"\n\nSpecific criticisms of the pledge include:\n\nIn the 2006 Florida case \"Frazier v. Alexandre\", No. 05-81142 (S.D. Fla. May 31, 2006), \"A federal district court in Florida ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, even though the law allows students to opt out, because they can only do so with written parental permission and are still required to stand during the recitation. Cameron Frazier, a student at Boynton Beach High School, was removed from a class after he refused to follow his teacher's instructions to recite the Pledge or stand during recitation.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "7144661", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7144661", "title": "Cyanide &amp; Happiness", "text": "Cyanide &amp; Happiness\n\nCyanide & Happiness (C&H), also known as Cyanide and Happiness, is a webcomic written and illustrated by Rob DenBleyker, Kris Wilson, Dave McElfatrick and formerly Matt Melvin, published on their website explosm.net. It was created and started running daily on January 25, 2005. It has appeared on social networking sites such as Myspace, Quora, LiveJournal, and Facebook, where, in April 2006, it had generated more than a million visits per week. The comic's authors attribute its success to its often controversial nature, and the series is noted for its dark humor and sometimes surrealistic approach. \"Cyanide & Happiness\" characters were used in the television advertisements for Orange Mobile's Orange Wednesdays.\n\n\"Cyanide & Happiness\" began as a small series of comics drawn by Kris Wilson at the age of sixteen. Wilson was at home with strep throat and had doodled some stick figure comics. On his DeviantArt profile page, he notes that he \"created \"Cyanide & Happiness\" in 2004 because I can't help but draw stupid looking characters to spew out my stupid ideas.\" He showcased his comics on his Comicaze website, and then on Sticksuicide.com, \"a website devoted to animations and games graphically depicting the violent deaths of stick figures\", which was founded by Rob DenBleyker in 2004.\n\nMeanwhile, DenBleyker and Matt Melvin had been working on projects where they \"made bad stick figure death movies together after posting their stuff at Newgrounds back in around 1999 and 2000.\" The forum's webmasters, including DenBleyker, Melvin, and Dave McElfatrick (who joined Sticksuicide) liked the format of Wilson's comics. Melvin said, \"When we decided to branch off from just stick figure death movies and do something more with the site, we started Explosm and brought Kris on board.\" Wilson and the webmasters then collaborated on the comics, where each person would contribute content. One of the earliest \"Cyanide & Happiness\" comics, #15, was posted by Wilson on Explosm.net on January 26, 2005. A variant of the comic's title is first mentioned in #121, in which one character sells cotton candy, and explains that it is made of \"Cyanide & Happyness\" [sic], after which the other character replies: \"Happyness!?!? Hot damn! I'll take 4\".\n\nThe cartoonists started out in different locations: In 2006, DenBleyker was a college student at University of Texas at Dallas. Wilson lived in Fort Bridger, Wyoming, Melvin in San Diego, California, and McElfatrick in Belfast, Northern Ireland. They would also use Skype for occasional collaboration. Melvin said, \"We collaborate here and there on them, but the comics are most often individual efforts. The animated shorts, however, are big collaborative projects, often bringing in people from outside our little, core group.\" Although they started working on the project in 2004, the authors did not meet each other face-to-face until the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con.\n\nThe format of \"Cyanide & Happiness\" is typically a single page where the cartoonist would post his comic. The page can vary in length and number of panels. The drawings are done in Macromedia Flash. Although generally static, some of the comics have animated panels. Others break the fourth wall; for instance, in #375, one of the characters looks at the reader, and the other asks what he is looking at. He then looks out and says \"Holy shit! It's a person!\" In #445, the panel catches on fire and the characters inside panic. In #680, a character has fallen through a broken bottom border of the panel.\n\nWilson and DenBleyker have mentioned the traditional comic \"The Far Side\" by Gary Larson and the webcomic \"The Perry Bible Fellowship\" by Nicholas Gurewitch as influences for the comic. Wilson mentioned Don Hertzfeldt, Bill Hicks, \"White Ninja Comics\", Monty Python, and David Wong as influences. At a Davenport College panel, DenBleyker commented that he writes for up to ten hours a day and collaborates with friends, however, in April 2013, he tweeted to replace \"reading classic philosophy texts\" with \"sitting in my car crying\". McElfatrick was inspired by old English children's comics such as \"The Beano and The Dandy\". Melvin did not read comics as a kid, but enjoyed Larson's \"The Far Side\" and Matt Groening's \"Life in Hell\"; he preferred live-action sketch comedy shows such as \"The Kids in the Hall\", \"Monty Python\", \"Upright Citizens Brigade\", and \"Mr. Show\".\n\nThe cartoonists regularly make jokes on controversial topics including abortion, suicide, and AIDS. Their characters rarely have names and are usually only distinguishable by the colors of their shirts. The male characters almost always have no hair, which became a joke in itself in #642. Female characters are distinguishable by their long hair and chest size, often used to comedic effect. Jesus makes appearances, accompanied with religious puns. Some recurring characters have names, such as \"Obese Maurice\" and the epileptic superhero \"Seizure Man\". DenBleyker added that the stick figure style \"makes the characters seem very transient, as if they only exist for a given comic. 'Cyanide and Happiness' prides itself on having no characters or themes. If we ever bring up a character, we usually retire it after its share of original jokes has run out.\"\n\nOne of the cartoonists' strips would be featured on a single page for the day. Melvin says that they \"keep a schedule of sorts, but it's nothing completely set in stone.\" Wilson credits the comic's success to consistent output: \"There are plenty of funny people creating content, but they're not consistent or reliable. The Internet has ADD, and if you're not constantly giving them something new, you're going to lose them.\"\n\nOn occasion, the \"Cyanide & Happiness\" cartoonists have featured Depressing Comic Weeks, where they wrote depressing and/or upsetting comics. In an interview, Melvin said, \"we'd made comics that were funny because of how dark they were. But now DCW is just about making really sad comics with no punchline whatsoever.\" The December 30th episode of the Cyanide and Happiness Show featured the \"depressing episode\" - coinciding with the 8th depressing comic week at explosm.net.\n\n\"Cyanide & Happiness\" has featured Guest Weeks, where readers submit entries, and some would be featured as daily comics over the course of the week.\n\nOn October 14, 2007, Wilson announced a desire for every comic in their archive to be translated into other languages. In a subsequent post, he reported a \"phenomenal\" 1300 replies with offers to translate into over 20 different languages.\n\nIn 2010, author Dave McElfatrick, a Northern Ireland native, started a petition for a visa into the United States, in order to be with the other writers to produce more animated shorts. The petition garnered over 132,000 signatures in less than three weeks. On September 1, 2010, it was officially announced that Dave qualified for the visa that would allow him to enter the United States to work on more comics and animated shorts with Wilson, DenBleyker, and Melvin. On August 31, 2014, Matt Melvin announced that he was no longer part of Cyanide and Happiness.\n\nJohn Hargrave of zug.com said that \"Despite all this solo effort, the end product is coherent and strangely logical, as if the four creators were each viewing the peculiar world of C&H from a slightly different angle -- a world in which disembodied heads turn into seagulls, and Jesus is a designated driver.\"\n\nDenBleyker has mentioned that the comic's popularity grew from their sharing policy, \"which encourages readers to repost and re-blog comics, effectively allowing anyone to spread \"Cyanide and Happiness\" content.\" In January 2006, the comic was getting about 20,000 unique visitors a day, but \"we added a little box under each comic which allows people to post an Explosm-linked version of the comic, which brings a lot of traffic back to us. After we put that box up, the traffic started exploding.\" After a few days, the comic received about 300,000 unique visitors a day, which consisted of mostly traffic from MySpace and LiveJournal blog links.\n\nIn response to the question regarding controversial topics, DenBleyker said that the authors have not received a huge amount of serious negative feedback and do not intend to tone down the edginess of their comics. Melvin notes that some of the respondents have criticized them on one topic, but at the same time praised them for a different one.\n\nBooks are released by Explosm through It Books, a division of HarperCollins. The first two volumes each feature 120 of their favorite \"Cyanide & Happiness\" comics, and 30 previously unpublished comics. The third volume featured many \"Cyanide & Happiness\" comics from their Depressing Comic Weeks with 40 previously unpublished comics,\nwhile the fourth is another compilation of the artists' favorites.\n\nIn addition to creating \"Cyanide & Happiness\" comic strips, the cartoonists have done animations drawn in a similar stick figure style. As of July 2017, there have been three full seasons of \"The Cyanide and Happiness Show\" (for a total of 31 episodes), and shorter cartoons continue to be produced weekly (and sometimes more often than that). The animations are in Adobe Flash format and are typically voiced by the cartoonists. Chase Suddarth contributes occasionally to the shorts. DenBleyker made a series called \"Joe Zombie\", which lasted six episodes, and left fans to anticipate a seventh, where he stated \"will come out eventually\".\n\nExplosm has worked on other webcomics, animation shorts and projects. McElfatrick wrote \"Die Romantic - A Look At Aiden\", which scathingly critiques goth punk band Aiden. After leaving the \"Cyanide and Hapiness\" team in November 2014, Melvin started a new webcomic, titled \"The Last Nerds on Earth\".\n\nExplosm released a \"Cyanide & Happiness\" app for mobile devices in 2013. The free \"Lite\" version allows the user to access the last 30 days of the archive. The \"Cyanide and Happiness\" team offer a selection of merchandise, including T-shirts, toys, novelties, housewares, and school supplies. The Explosm website also sells signed prints.\n\nOn February 9, 2016, Explosm started a Kickstarter project for a \"Cyanide & Happiness\" card game titled \"Joking Hazard\", in which cards represent panels of a 3-panel comic and the players must attempt to form a humorous combination. The project's funding finished on March 10, 2016, with over $3.2 million USD in backings. \"Joking Hazard\" is currently the second most funded card game in Kickstarter history, after \"Exploding Kittens\".\n\nOn September 5, 2017, Explosm began another Kickstarter for a Cyanide and Happiness video game with a goal of $300,000, earning over $575,000. The game is described to borrow elements from games such as , and throughout backing players could pledge to put themselves in the game via different ways, such as a \"memorial wall\", a permanent school record, a grave stone or even become an actual NPC. The game is slated to be released near the end of 2018.\n"}
{"id": "35546010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35546010", "title": "Dominican Creole French", "text": "Dominican Creole French\n\nDominican Creole French is a French-based creole, which is the generally spoken language in Dominica. It is highly mutually intelligible with its much more widely spoken immediate neighbor, Antillean Creole, of which it might be considered a distinct variety.\n\nIt is a sub-variety of Antillean Creole, which is spoken in other islands of the Lesser Antilles and is very closely related to the varieties spoken in Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Lucia, Grenada and parts of Trinidad and Tobago. The intelligibility rate with speakers of other varieties of Antillean Creole is almost 100%. Its syntactic, grammatical and lexical features are virtually identical to that of Martinican Creole, though, like its Saint Lucian counterpart, it includes more English loanwords than the Martinican variety. People who speak Haitian Creole can also understand Dominican Creole French, even though there are a number of distinctive features; they are mutually intelligible.\n\nLike the other French-based creole languages in the Caribbean, Dominican French Creole is primarily French-derived vocabulary, with African and Carib influences to its syntax. In addition, many expressions reflect the presence of an English Creole and Spanish influences are also very much present in the language.\n\nIn 1635, the French seized Guadeloupe and Martinique and began establishing sugar colonies. Dominica, for its part, had not been colonized because all attempts to colonize it had failed. Before 1690, lumberjacks (English and French) had traveled to Dominica for its forest resources. Subsequently, French from Martinique and Guadeloupe and their slaves settled in Dominica by establishing small farms of coffee, cotton, wood, and tobacco. Creole thus develops among the slaves, Dominican Creole thus comes from the mixture of the Creoles from Guadeloupe and Martinique, and then it is enriched further with Amerindian and English words. From now on, the Creole would stay until the present. Despite the future transfer of the island to the English and the addition of English words, the Creole remains strongly French in Dominica and despite what is said, is his place in the center of the Dominicans culture. The underdevelopment of the road system in Dominica hindered for a long time the development of English, the official language of the country, in isolated villages, where Creole remained the only spoken language.\n\nWe must remember that Creole developed in the French slavery plantation environment. While Africans pronounced the French language the best they understood with their own accents, not all its consonants would be reproduced exactly the same. The \"R\" was realized as \"W\". Commonly, the Creole countries that have French as their official language no longer retain this characteristic; however, the islands sold to the English do retain this usage.\n\nPour la personne du singulier neutre \"I\" il est à noter également que contrairement à d'autres créoles antillais, l'utilisation de \"li\" en pronom personnel non-réfléchi est quasiment absente.\n\n1 234 = yon mil + dé san + twantkat\n\n30 153 = twant mil + san + senkantwa\n\n412 489 = (kat san douz)mil + kat san + katwèvennèf\n\n12 356 734 = (douz) milyon + (twa san+senkantsis)mil + sèt san+twantkat\n\nFirst = pwémyè\n\nSecond = dézyènm\n\nThird = twazyènm\n\nAll others are formed like this: Number + [yènm]\n\nThere are verbs well known for their frequent use in Creole. As Creole is made by the fusion of different languages and cultures, pronunciation is the basis of language training. The negative is formed by adding the \"pa\" in front of the verb whereas there are two exceptions (below).\n\n\nAll verbs in Creoles are built with predicates except for some exceptions that do not require the presence of \"ka\".\n\nDes exemples :\n\nWhen using the article, we add it after the name which differs from what we see in the French syntax. \"La\" follows nouns that end with a consonant or \"y\". When a name ends with a vowel, it is followed by \"a\" only.\nL’article indéfini a deux formes. Le masculin « yon » et la féminine « yonn » par exemple.\n\nLe pluriel de l'article se forme en ajoutant « sé + nom + la/a ». La même règle applique en mettant l’article défini après le nom.\nPosant les questions sont très facile an Kwéyòl. Vous pouvez articuler avec l'intonation de votre voix pour poser un question. Ex.

He began work on it in 1761 but only finished it in 1774. It was rejected by the Comédie-Française and published unperformed in 1775.\n\nThe action takes place at the court of medieval Castille. Don Pèdre (Peter of Castile) faces claims from his half brother Transtamare (Henry II of Castile) both for the throne and for the hand of Léonore de la Cerda. With better connections and the support of the Church, Transtamare defeats Don Pèdre with the help of French soldiers led by Bertrand du Guesclin. Transtamare murders Pèdre with his own hands and seizes the throne. Léonore chooses to die rather than endure marriage with him.\n\nVoltaire began working on the material for the play in 1761. As his campaigns against Church abuses gathered pace (under the slogan 'écrasez l’infâme’) he reworked it to place particular emphasis on the unhealthy influence of the religious authorities. Voltaire’s perspective on the characters was unusual; most previous writers had presented Transtamare as a hero and Don Pedro as his evil opponent; he reversed the usual roles.\n\nThe Comédie-Française declined to put on the play, and it was not taken up by any other theatre. This rejection was not particularly to do with the play's critical attitude towards the Church, but more to do with the unsatisfactory and inconsistent characterisation. When the play was published, Voltaire added a dedicatory letter to d'Alembert and a historical and critical discourse about the tragedy, as well as four short texts: \"Éloge historique de la raison\", \"De L'encyclopédie\", \"Dialoque de Pégase et du vieillard\" and \"La Tactique\".\n\n"}

The ballad tells how the Falstaffian knight, Moore of Moore Hall, obtains a bespoke suit of spiked Sheffield armour and delivers a fatal kick to the dragon's \"arse-gut,\" its only vulnerable spot - as the dragon explains with its dying breath. The topography of the ballad is accurate in its detail as regards Wharncliffe Crags and environs, but the story, and its burlesque humour, has been enjoyed in places far from the landscape from which it appears to derive and has been used to make a number of points unrelated to it.\n\nMore Hall is a 15th-century (or earlier) residence immediately below the gritstone edge of Wharncliffe Crags—Wharncliffe being formerly known in the local vernacular as Wantley—The dragon was reputed to reside in a den, and to fly across the valley to Allman (Dragon's) Well on the Waldershelf ridge above Deepcar.\n\nA lawsuit was taken out in 1573 by one George More of Sheffield on behalf of the Sheffield Burgery (the 'free men' of Sheffield) against the Lord of the manor of Sheffield, George Talbot, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, in respect of his appropriation of the proceeds of Sheffield 'waste' land, which hitherto had paid for Sheffield's poor, civic works and the parish church. [see \"The Records of the Sheffield Burgery\" by John Daniel Leader (1897); and \"Church and Manor: A Study in English Economic History\", by Sidney Oldall Addy (1913)]. This had long been the practice under an agreement in 1297 by one of Talbot's predecessors, one Thomas Furnival [see \"Sheffield (History and Guide)\" by David Fine (1991)], and had seemed secure after a successful petition some two decades previously to the newly enthroned Queen Mary with the full support of George Talbot's father (the previous—fifth—Earl of Shrewsbury, Francis Talbot) [see the ‘history’ section of the website of the Sheffield Church Burgesses Trust http://www.sheffieldchurchburgesses.org.uk/history-of-sheffield-church-burgesses-trust.htm].\n\nIn his \"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry\" Thomas Percy holds that the story of \"The Dragon of Wantley\" relates to a dispute over the alleged misappropriation of church tithes in Wharncliffe by Sir Francis Wortley who was opposed by a local lawyer named More. \n\nHenry Carey wrote the libretto to a burlesque opera called \"The Dragon of Wantley\" in 1737. The opera, with music composed by John Frederick Lampe, punctured the vacuous operatic conventions and pointed a satirical barb at Robert Walpole and his taxation policies. The opera was a huge success and its initial run was 69 performances in the first season; a number which exceeded even \"The Beggar's Opera\". The opera debuted at the Haymarket Theatre, where its coded attack on Walpole would have been clear, but its long run occurred after it moved to Covent Garden, which had a much greater capacity for staging. Part of its satire of opera was that it had all of the words sung, including the recitatives and da capo arias. The play itself is very brief on the page, as it relied extensively on absurd theatrics, dances, and other non-textual entertainments. \"The Musical Entertainer\" from 1739 contains engravings showing how the staging was performed *\n\nThe piece is at once a satire of the ridiculousness of operatic staging and an indirect satire of the government's tax policy. In Carey's play, Moore of Moorehall, \"a valiant knight, in love with Margery,\" is a drunk who pauses to deal with the dragon only between bouts of drinking and carousing with women. Margery offers herself as a human sacrifice to Moore to persuade him to take on the cause of battling the dragon, and she is opposed Mauxalinda, Moore's \"cast-off mistress,\" who has interest in him now that a rival has appeared.\n\nThe battle with the dragon takes place entirely offstage, and Moore only wounds the dragon (who is more reasonable than Moore in his dialogue) in its anus. The main action concerns the lavish dances and songs by the two sopranos and Moore.\n\nThe opera is now rarely performed. A fully staged production was performed by the West London amateur group, Isleworth Baroque, in the theatre at West Thames College and the University of Birmingham performed the opera as part of their Summer Festival in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts.\n\nA novel, \"The Dragon of Wantley\", was written by Owen Wister (best known as the author of \"The Virginian\") in 1892. Published by Lippincott Press, the story is a comic \"burlesque\" (in the author's words), concerning the \"true\" story of the Dragon. It is a romantic story set at Christmastime in the early 13th century. The book was a surprise success, going through four editions over the next ten years.\n\nThere is a representation of the dragon above More Hall on the opposite side of the valley to Wharncliffe Crags. The snaking stone wall culminating in a carved dragon's head can be found at the southern edge of Bitholmes Wood (Grid Ref:295 959). There is also a bas-relief frieze of a knight killing a dragon, said to be a representation of More and the Dragon of Wantley, in the entrance hall to Sheffield Town Hall.\n\nIn his Barsetshire novels Anthony Trollope names an inn and posting house in Barchester \"The Dragon of Wantley\". When it is first mentioned, in The Warden, this pub is owned by John Bold, a local doctor, who is pursuing a dispute with the church authorities over the alleged misapplication of ecclesiastical revenues. \n\nWorks cited\n\n - original text on Wikisource.\n"}

It involves dressing up, usually to impersonate someone or something, like an animal or character in a fairy tale. The type of clothes they dress up in often resembles who they are trying to be, either adults' clothing or special play clothes designed specifically for dress-up like feather boas and jewelry.\n\nComputer games in which users dress up characters have been published on the Internet.\n\nThis is a brief list of some of the things children play when they engage in dress-up:\n\nThe extension of playing dress up onto dolls made of paper can be traced back as far as the mid-1700s. They have enjoyed great popularity around the world, as they are relatively cheap to produce, yet still offer a rich, dress up experience. They had been published in books, in newspapers and in magazines. In the 20th century, the genre was dominated by dolls created by artist Tom Tierny.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1990s, webmasters began creating interactive virtual dress-up games in which a person could drag and drop clothes onto a paper doll-like image. One of the most notable early adaptors of virtual dress up technology were the Kisekae System Sets (KiSS), which were developed in Japan. These stand-alone games featured a manga-styled model and a small wardrobe. The next phenomenon was Dollz: small, pixel-art GIF images that were presented scattered on websites, and allowed users to be dragged onto the pixel dolls.\n\nBy 2007, dress up games had changed. With the introduction of Macromedia (later Adobe) Flash technology, the number of dress-up games creator dramatically increased. Flash offered a visual-based way for artists to learn simple programming, and put a powerful tool in the hands of doll enthusiasts. The number of games and websites grew, as companies found easy success in a market that was previously under-supplied. The genre continued expanding, yielding an over-supply of mass-produced dress up game websites. The saturation is reminiscent of the video game crash of 1983.\n\nIn the late 2010s, a few websites managed by dedicated dress up fans utilized Adobe Flash to create dress up games that also allow complete customization of the featured character, advancing the genre to \"doll makers\". These applications also featured extensive hairstyle and clothing choices, allowing for longer gameplay. The games pushed beyond the usual stereotypes of the genre, and expanded to more pop culture and fantasy themes.\n\n"}

A guild's banner or flag was considered a symbol of purity, and as such it was not allowed to touch the ground.\n\nThere are two major categories of flag throwing: classical and acrobatical. In classical flag throwing, the flag is turned left and right around the body in a standing posture. In acrobatical flag throwing, the thrower uses both hands to move the flag in a sitting, laying, or kneeling posture.\n\n"}
{"id": "324066", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=324066", "title": "Hopscotch", "text": "Hopscotch\n\nHopscotch is a children's game that can be played with several players or alone. Hopscotch is a popular playground game in which players toss a small object into numbered triangles or a pattern of rectangles outlined on the ground and then hop or jump through the spaces to retrieve the object.\n\nTo play hopscotch, a court is first laid out on the ground. Depending on the available surface, the court is either scratched out in the dirt or drawn with chalk on pavement. Courts may be permanently marked where playgrounds are commonly paved, as in elementary schools. Designs vary, but the court is usually composed of a series of linear squares interspersed with blocks of two lateral squares. Traditionally the court ends with a \"safe\" or \"home\" base in which the player may turn before completing the reverse trip. The home base may be a square, a rectangle, or a semicircle. The squares are then numbered in the sequence in which they are to be hopped.\n\nThe first player tosses a stone or marker also called a \"lucky\", onto the court. This object should land in the square without bouncing, sliding, or rolling out. It is typically a small flat stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm (in Ireland, it is usually played with an old shoe polish tin or flat stone, called a piggy). The marker must land completely within the square without touching the line. The player then hops through the course, skipping the square with the marker in it. Single squares must be hopped on one foot. For the first single square, either foot may be used. Side-by-side squares are straddled, with the left foot landing in the left square, and the right foot landing in the right square. Optional squares marked \"Safe\", \"Home\", or \"Rest\" are neutral squares, and may be hopped through in any manner without penalty. After hopping into \"Safe\", \"Home\", or \"Rest\", the player must then turn around and return through the course (square 9, then squares 8 and 7, next square 6, and so forth) on one or two legs depending on the square until reaching the square with the marker. The player stops in the square before the marker and reaches down to retrieve the marker and continue the course as stated, without touching a line or stepping into a square with another player's marker.\n\nUpon successfully completing the sequence, the player continues the turn by tossing the marker into square number two, and repeating the pattern.\n\nIf, while hopping through the court in either direction, the player steps on a line, misses a square, or loses balance, the turn ends. Players begin their turns where they last left off. The first player to complete one course for every numbered square on the court wins the game.\n\nAlthough the marker is most often picked up during the game, historically, in the boy's game, the marker was kicked sequentially back through the course on the return trip and then kicked out.\n\nIt is attested that an ancient form of hopscotch was played by Roman children, but the first recorded references to the game in the English-speaking world date to the late 17th century, usually under the name \"scotch-hop\" or \"scotch-hopper(s)\". A manuscript \"Book of Games\" compiled between 1635 and 1672 by Francis Willughby refers to 'Scotch Hopper‥. They play with a piece of tile or a little flat piece of lead, upon a boarded floor, or any area divided into oblong figures like boards'. In Poor Robin's Almanack for 1677, the game is referred to as \"Scotch-hoppers\". The entry states, \"The time when schoolboys should play at Scotch-hoppers.\" The 1707 edition of Poor Robin's Almanack includes the following phrase… \"Lawyers and Physicians have little to do this month, so they may (if they will) play at Scotch-hoppers.\" In 1828, Webster's \"An American Dictionary of the English language\" also referred to the game as 'Scotch-hopper' ... 'a play in which boys hop over scotches and lines in the ground.'\n\nSince the game was known and popular in the seventeenth century, it is logical to suppose it may have existed at least a few decades (or perhaps even many centuries) before its earliest literary reference; but no conclusive evidence has yet been presented to support this theory.\n\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the etymology of \"hopscotch\" is a formation from the words \"hoop\" and \"\", the latter in the sense of \"an incised line or scratch\". The journal of the British Archaeological Association, Volume 26 (dated March 9, 1870) states, \"The sport of Hop-Scotch or Scotch-Hoppers is called in Yorkshire 'Hop-Score,' and in Suffolk 'Scotch Hobbies or Hobby,' from the boy who gets on the player's back whilst hopping or 'hicking,' as it is there termed; and in Scotland it is known as 'Peevers, Peeverels, and Pabats.'\"\n\nThere are many other forms of hopscotch played across the globe. In India it is called Stapu, Nondi (Tamil) or Kith-Kith, in Spain and some Latin American countries, it's \"rayuela\", although it may also be known as \"golosa\" or \"charranca\". In Turkey, it is Seksek (the verb \"sek\" means to jump with one foot). In Russian it is known as \"классики\" (diminutive for the word meaning \"classes\"). In Poland, it is called \"klasy\", meaning \"classes\" (rectangular shape, with the use of no marker but with speaking names of various items of a given class, e.g. colours or flowers, while jumping on successive fields) or \"pajac\", meaning \"buffoon\" (human shape, with the use of a thrown marker, e.g. a piece of glass or stone). Swedes name the game \"hoppa hage\" (lit. \"jumping the garden\"), while in Norway it is called \"paradis\", or Paradise. In Italy the game is known as \"campana\" (meaning \"bell\"), or \"mondo\" (meaning \"world\"). In the Netherlands and Flanders, it is called \"Hinkelen\". In Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia it is called \"školica\", meaning \"little school\". In Malaysia the most popular variant is called \"tengteng\". In Mexico, it is called \"bebeleche (mamaleche)\" meaning \"drink milk\" or \"avioncito\" meaning \"little plane\" (\"probably because of the shape\"). In Cuba and in Puerto Rico it is called \"La Peregrina\" (meaning \"Pilgrim Girl\") and the squares represent the 9 rings the pilgrim traveler has to pass in order to reach Heaven from Purgatory according to Dante's Inferno. In Romania the game is called \"șotron\" and is widely played by children all over the country. In Brazil it is called \"amarelinha\". The name evolved from \"marelle\", the French name for the game, but was identified to the radical \"amarelo\" (yellow) and its diminutive in -inho/a. In Breton, the name is \"reg\" or \"delech\". The Albanian variant is called \"rrasavi\", which is composed of two words: \"rrasa\" (\"the flat stone\", an object used to play the game) and \"vi\" (\"line\", a reference to the lines that comprise the diagram of the course). In Philippines, hopscotch is called \"piko\" (pee-ko) and sometimes also called kiki (ki-ki). Its common court in the Philippines has six squares. In India, hopscotch is called \"thikrya\", because broken stones called 'thikrya' are slid across the grid as players hop to next squares. In South Korea, hopscotch is called \"sabancchigi\" (\"사방치기\", meaning \"Hitting the Four Cardinal Directions\") and is widely played across the nation.\n\nThe game's generic name in Persian is Laylay. The most common form of Laylay in Iran resembles the older Western types and uses six or more (always an even number) side-by-side squares successively (vertically) numbered. The player uses a peg or a flat stone that the player must kick to the next square as the player is hopping. If either the stone or a player's foot lands on a line, the player forfeits the game (or loses a turn). Although somewhat less common, the contemporary Western type is also played.\n\nIn the Glasgow area, the game is called \"beds\" or \"Peever(s)\". \"Peever\" is also the name of the object which is slid across the grid to land in a square. In the 1950s and 1960s in Glasgow, it was common for the peever to be a shoe polish tin filled with stones or dirt and screwed shut.\n\nA French variant of hopscotch is known as \"escargot\" (snail) or \"marelle ronde\" (round hopscotch). It is played on a spiral course. Players must hop on one foot to the center of the spiral and then reverse their path to back out again.\n\nIf the player reaches the center without stepping on a line or losing balance he or she marks one square with his or her initials, and from then on may place two feet in that square, while all other players must hop over it. The game ends when all squares are marked or no one can reach the center, and the winner is the player who \"owns\" the most squares.\n\nIn Germany, Austria, and Switzerland the game is called \"Himmel und Hölle\" (Heaven and Hell) although there are also some other names used, depending on the region. The square below \"1\" or the \"1\" itself are called \"Erde\" (Earth) while the second to last square is the \"Hölle\" (Hell) and the last one is \"Himmel\" (Heaven). The first player throws a small stone into the first square and then jumps to the square and must kick the stone to the next square and so on, however, neither the stone nor the player may stop in \"Hell\" so they try to skip that square.\n\nIn India, hopscotch is also called \"Kith-Kith\", \"Stapu\", in the Hindi-speaking areas, or \"Ekhaat Duhaat\" or \"Ekka Dukka\" in Bengal, \"Chirpi\" in Maharashtra, Kunte bille in Karnataka, Paandi in Tamil Nadu, and Tokkudu Billa in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. These games have similar principles in that players must hop on one foot and must throw the marker in the right square. The game is mostly common among girls in India, though some boys play too.\n\nHopscotch was/is called Potsy in New York City. (The name probably refers to the \"potsherd\" that was used as a marker.)\n\nIn Brazil, this game is called Amarelinha.\n\nIn Australia, hopscotch is played in stages. The first stage is played by hopping per the standard rules. Once this stage is complete, the player is promoted to the next stage called \"jumps\" where the player jumps into each square with two feet. The final stage is the most difficult stage called \"sizzles\", which is similar to jumps except the legs are crossed. The first player to complete all three stages wins. If a player touches a line, he is demoted to the start of his current stage. For younger players, \"helps\" can be used. These are lines typically extended at the sides between squares 2 and 3 so younger players can use these to get closer to throwing the \"tortoise \" into the required square.\n\nIs the name of the game, at least in Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Uruguay and Spain.\n\nChindro is the South Asian version of hopscotch.\n\nThe current \"Guinness Book of World Records\" holder for the fastest hopscotch game is Ashrita Furman, at 1 minute and 8 seconds.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "333003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=333003", "title": "Infotainment", "text": "Infotainment\n\nInfotainment (a portmanteau of \"information\" and \"entertainment\"), also called soft news, is a type of media, usually television, that provides a combination of information and entertainment. The term is usually used disapprovingly against more serious hard news. Many existing, self-described infotainment websites and social media apps provide a variety of functions and services.\n\nThe label \"infotainment\" is emblematic of concern and criticism that journalism is devolving from a medium which conveys serious information about issues affecting public interest, into a form of entertainment which happens to have fresh \"facts\" in the mix. The criteria by which reporters and editors judge news value—whether something is worth putting on the front page, the bottom of the hour, or is worth commenting on at all—are integral parts of this debate. Some blame the media for this perceived phenomenon, for failing to live up to ideals of civic journalistic responsibility, while others blame the commercial nature of many media organizations, the need for higher ratings, combined with a preference among the public for feel-good content and \"unimportant\" topics such as celebrity gossip or sports. In a critique of infotainment, Bonnie Anderson of \"News Flash\" cited a CNN lead story on February 2, 2004 following the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast on national television. The follow-up story was about a ricin chemical attack on then-U.S. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.\n\nA specialization process has also occurred, beginning with the rise of mass market special-interest magazines, moving into broadcast with the advent of cable television, and continuing into new media such as the Internet and satellite radio. An increasing number of media outlets are available to the public which exclusively focus on single topics such as current events, home improvement, history, movies, women and Christianity. Consumers have a broad choice whether they receive a general feed of the most \"important\" information of the day or a highly customized presentation of a single type of content. Highly customized content streams may not be considered newsworthy nor contain a neutral point of view. Some publications and channels have found a sizable audience in the \"niche\" of featuring hard news.\n\nControversy has continued over the size of the audience and whether outlets are diluting content with too much \"soft\" news. The distinction between journalists and anchors versus reporters are \"human interest\", personality, or celebrity news story pieces. \"Soft\" news reporters and stories are typically directed by marketing share departments based on a demographic appeal and audience share. It is commonly accepted news anchors are also media personalities which may also be considered celebrities. Media outlets commonly use on-air personalities for their public appeal to promote the network's investments similar to the regular broadcast schedule including self-promotion and advertising. Critics might go so far as to view anchors as a weak link, representing the misplacement of both the credit and the accountability of a news journalism organization—hence adding to a perceived erosion of journalistic standards throughout the news business. (See yellow journalism.)\n\nMost infotainment television programs on networks and broadcast cable only contain general information on the subjects they cover and should not be considered to be formal learning or instruction. An example of a broadcast may include accusations of a celebrity or other individual committing a crime with no verifiable factual support or evidence of such claims. It can be said that many viewers and social critics disapprove of how media, particularly TV and cable, seem to hurtle from one event to another, often dwelling on trivial, celebrity-driven content As seen with the commodification celebrities and public figures/leaders, news media is more frequently commodifying and selling the stories of people’s lives for pure viewer reaction and entertainment as opposed to more focus being placed on real stories with informative meaning behind them.\n\nIn October 2010 at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear, American political satirist Jon Stewart made a metaphorical statement regarding the media today: \"The press can hold its magnifying glass up to our problems . . . illuminating issues heretofore unseen, or they can use that magnifying glass to light ants on fire and then perhaps host a week of shows on the sudden, unexpected, dangerous flaming ant epidemic.\" This statement referred to the news media's ability to focus in on the real problems of people, and transform them into what is known as infotainment, when this information is solely provided for the public's entertainment. Today's broadcasting of informative news is often diluted with stories of scandal, although this is no concern for media and news broadcasters because if you can keep enough viewers week after week focused on whatever is that next \"flaming ant epidemic\" (e.g., a congressman’s sexual indiscretions, conspiracy theories about the president's birth certificate and other examples related to politainment), you can boost audience ratings and sell ads at higher rates\n\nHistorically, the term \"infotainment\" was used to discredit woman journalists who were assigned soft news jobs. Soft news was expected to be consumed by only women, but eventually, thanks to the presence of more women in the news force and the changing media landscape, it became the norm of news media in general.\n\nSome define \"journalism\" only as reporting on \"serious\" subjects, where common journalistic standards are upheld by the reporter. Others believe that the larger \"news business\" encompasses everything from professional journalism to so-called \"soft news\" and \"infotainment\", and support activities such as marketing, advertising sales, finance and delivery. Nevertheless, a differentiation of the two concepts of \"hard news\" and \"soft news\" is controversial. Professional journalism is supposed to place more emphasis on research, fact-checking, and the public interest than its \"non-journalistic\" counterparts. Because the term \"news\" is quite broad, the terms \"hard\" and \"soft\" denote both a difference in respective standards for news value, as well as for standards of conduct, relative to the professional ideals of journalistic integrity.\n\nThe idea of hard news embodies two orthogonal concepts:\nThe logical opposite, soft news is sometimes referred to in a derogatory fashion as infotainment.\nDefining features catching the most criticism include:\n\nTimely events happen in less serious subjects—sporting matches, celebrity misadventures, movie releases, art exhibits, and so on.\n\nThere may also be serious reports which are not event-driven—coverage of important social, economic, legal, or technological trends— investigative reports which uncover ongoing corruption, pollution, or immorality— or discussion of unsettled political issues without any special reason. Anniversaries, holidays, the end of a year or season, or the end of the first 100 days of an administration, can make some stories time-sensitive, but provide more of an opportunity for reflection and analysis than any actual \"news\" to report.\n\nThe spectrum of \"seriousness\" and \"importance\" is not well-defined, and different media organizations make different tradeoffs. \"News you can use\", a common marketing phrase highlighting a specific genre of journalism, spans the gray area. Gardening tips and hobby \"news\" pretty clearly fall at the entertainment end. Warnings about imminent natural disasters or acute domestic security threats (such as air raids or terrorist attacks) are considered so important that broadcast media (even non-news channels) usually interrupt other programming to announce them. A medical story about a new treatment for breast cancer, or a report about local ground water pollution might fall in between. So might book reviews, or coverage of religion. On the other hand, people frequently find hobbies and entertainment to be worthwhile parts of their lives and so \"importance\" on a personal level is rather subjective.\n\nInfotainment is generally identified by its entertaining nature through the use of flashy graphics, fast-paced editing, music, and the use sensationalism or satire. Popular examples include \"Entertainment Tonight\", \"Hannity and Colmes\", \"The Daily Show\", and shows that would not be classified as news earlier, such as \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\".\n\nInfotainers are entertainers in infotainment media, such as news anchors or satirists who cross the line between journalism (quasi-journalism) and entertainment. Barbara Walters, was for many an infotainer icon. She pioneered the many techniques used in the Infotainment media today. Other notable examples in the U.S. media are Jon Stewart, Bill O’Reilly, Rachel Maddow and Geraldo Rivera among others.\n\nWhen Geraldo Rivera became the host of his own news-oriented talk show on CNBC, others within the NBC organization voiced their protest, including Tom Brokaw who was reported to have threatened to quit. Rivera had a notorious history as a \"sleaze reporter\" and daytime talk show host, where he and one or two others were representative of \"Tabloid talk shows\"; television seen to have little social value or redeeming intelligence, but still popular with viewers.\n\nThe broadcast of important or interesting events was originally meant simply to inform society of local or international events for their own safety and awareness. However, local news broadcasters are more regularly commodifying local events to provoke titillation and entertainment in viewers. Commodification is known as the process by which material objects are turned into marketable goods with monetary (exchange) value. Essential qualities of human beings and their products are converted into commodities, into things for buying and selling on the market, just as entertaining stories are sold to buy the attention of viewers.\n\nCommodity fetishism is the process through which commodities are emptied of the meaning of their production (the labour that produced them and the context in which they were produced) and filled instead with the abstract meaning (usually through advertising). At their worst, the media's appetite for telling and selling stories leads them not only to document tragedy, but also to misrepresent or exploit it As often seen in the news (with stories of extreme obesity or unusual deformities) present-day \"infotainment\" commodifies humans through their personal tragedies or scandals, providing entertainment and titillation to public viewers.\n\nThe topic of news media today being more commonly considered “infotainment” has increased with the growing popularity and use of social media applications. These popular social media outlets are what German theorist Jürgen Habermas would define as the \"public sphere\". According to Habermas, it defines a social space (which may be virtual) in which citizens come together to debate and discuss the present issues of their society. The term has been used more recently in the plural to refer to the multiple public spheres in which people debate contemporary issues. In the case of social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook, which were originally created for the purpose of connecting, re-connecting and sharing personal thoughts and information with public, they have now provided a new medium for the spread of \"infotainment\" and exploitation of public matters. There is no doubt that these social media websites are dominating, and what is so pressing about the matter is the fact that alongside cell phone technology, these ways of online communication are becoming prominent to the simple relaying of informative news. Of necessity, a commodity-based society produces such phantom objectivity, and in so doing it obscures its roots. The public society are relying more frequently on television news broadcasting and now social media outlets to obtain a mixture of information and entertainment updates which are known as \"infotainment.\"\n\nThe terms \"infotainment\" and \"infotainer\" were first used in September 1980 at the Joint Conference of Aslib, the Institute of Information Scientists and the Library Association in Sheffield, UK. The Infotainers were a group of British information scientists who put on comedy shows at their professional conferences between 1980 and 1990. In 1983, infotainment began to see more popular usage \nAround this time, infotainment gradually began to replace soft news with communications theorists.\n\nAn earlier, and slightly variant term, \"infortainment\" was coined in 1974 as the title of the 1974 convention of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS), the association of college radio stations in the United States. It took place on April 5–7, 1974, at the Statler Hilton Hotel, now the Hotel Pennsylvania. It was defined as the \"nexus between Information and Entertainment\".\n\n\n"}

This is a reference to a comment made by Maduro during the 2013 elections in Venezuela, when he said that the late Chávez had reincarnated in a little bird and talked to him to bless his candidacy. Maduro criticized his portrayal in the animation. He said that it was not an accurate representation of his face, his moustache, of his voice.\n\n"}

The society was founded in 1914 with the object of studying the History and Civilization of Palestine and of disseminating its knowledge.\n\nThe Israel Exploration Society plays a key role in archaeological research covering all periods, from prehistoric times to the Ottoman period. It coordinates much of the multi-institutional archaeological research carried out by both Israeli and foreign archaeological expeditions in Israel. Major activities undertaken by the IES include organizing excavations, enlisting financial support for archaeological projects, publishing excavation reports and liaison and cooperation with Israeli and foreign institutions in the field of publication and in a collective effort to promote the cause of archaeology.\n\nThe IES is a non-profit organization governed by an Executive Committee and a Council comprising representatives from all of the institutes of archaeology in the Israel and several major archaeological museums.\n\nThe Society’s activities were disrupted by the outbreak of World War I but resumed in 1920, when it became known as the Jewish Palestine Exploration Society. During the period of the British Mandate, it was responsible for the first archaeological excavations ever conducted by a Jewish organization in Palestine, at Hamat Tiberias, where Nahum Slouschz discovered a synagogue.Other digs were carried out at Absalom’s tomb, around Jerusalem's Old City walls, Ramat Rachel, Beit She'arim and Tel Bet Yerah.\n\nFollowing Israel’s War of Independence, the IES received the first excavation permit issued by the Israeli government allowing it to excavate at Tell Qasile. Since then, the IES has organised and sponsored some of the most important archaeological projects carried out in the country including Tel Hazor, Masada, the excavations in Jerusalem near the Temple Mount, in the Jewish Quarter, and at the City of David, the Judean Desert Expeditions, En-Gedi, Tel Arad, Lachish, Aphek, Jericho, Herodium, Yoqneam, Dor and Tel Megiddo.\n\nAnother facet of the IES’s activity is the dissemination of knowledge gained from the exploration of Israel to the general public in Israel and abroad. Fifty-nine archaeological conferences have been held for members of the IES. These annual gatherings include lectures by archaeologists and guided tours of recently discovered sites. Hebrew-speaking members receive the semi-annual \"Qadmoniot\", while the semi-annual \"Israel Exploration Journal\" caters for English readers. The \"Eretz Israel\" festschrift series publishes original archaeological, historical and geographical studies in Hebrew and English in honor of leading international scholars in these fields. Twenty-seven volumes have appeared to date.\n\nThe IES, in cooperation with other institutions, has held thirty annual meetings for the professional archaeological community in Israel. Two international congresses on Biblical archaeology were held in 1984 and 1990, attracting hundreds of participants from around the world. The proceedings of both have been published in two volumes entitled \"Biblical Archaeology Today\". In 1997 an international congress was held in Jerusalem marking 50 years since the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls. The proceedings appear in the volume \"The Dead Sea Scrolls Fifty Years after their Discovery\".\n\nPublications include \"The Ancient Pottery of Israel and Its Neighbors from the Neolithic through the Hellenistic Period\" prepared together with the Israel Antiquities Authority and the W.F. Albright Institute; and \"The New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land\", which appeared in four-volume Hebrew and English editions in 1993.\n\nIn 1989, the Israel Exploration Society was awarded the Israel Prize for its special contribution to society and the State of Israel. The citation of the judges’ committee notes: “It has been the principal and most effective institution for furthering knowledge of the archaeology and history of the country both at home and abroad since it was founded seventy-five years ago.”\n\n\n"}

The stories were initially printed in the city newspaper, \"The Manhattan Mercury\", during the centennial and later collected into a self-published book by Filinger, who created Kaw to be Kansas' answer to other heroes like Bunyan and Pecos Bill. Elmer Tomasch of the Kansas State University Art Department provided ink drawings to illustrate the stories and the book.\n\nFiilinger's stories related how Johnny Kaw created the Kansas landscape, geography and pioneer trails. Kaw was said to have dug the Kansas River Valley, planted wheat, invented sunflowers, and grown giant potatoes. Kaw even controlled the weather, lopping the funnels off tornadoes and wringing out the clouds to end droughts. His pets were the mascots for the two state universities: a wildcat and a jayhawk, who enjoyed a good fight. The Dust Bowl was said to be a result of their fights.\n\nFilinger's book was not republished after 1969, but Kansas author Jerri Garretson released a children's picture book about Johnny Kaw in 1997.

Initially Kaunos was a separate state; then it became a part of Caria and later still of Lycia.\n\nKaunos was an important sea port, the history of which is supposed to date back till the 10th century BC. Because of the formation of İztuzu Beach and the silting of the former Bay of Dalyan (from approx. 200 BC onwards), Kaunos is now located about 8 km from the coast. The city had two ports, the southern port at the southeast of \"Küçük Kale\" and the inner port at its northwest (the present \"Sülüklü Göl\", Lake of the Leeches). The southern port was used from the foundation of the city till roughly the end of the Hellenistic era, after which it became inaccessible due to its drying out. The inner or trade port could be closed by chains. The latter was used till the late days of Kaunos, but due to the silting of the delta and the ports, Kaunos had by then long lost its important function as a trade port. After Caria had been captured by Turkish tribes and the serious malaria epidemic of the 15th century AD, Kaunos was completely abandoned.\n\nIn 1966 Prof. Baki Öğün started the excavations of ancient Kaunos. These have been continued up to the present day, and are now supervised by Prof. Cengiz Işık.\n\nThe archeological research is not limited to Kaunos itself, but is also carried out in locations nearby e.g. near the Sultaniye Spa where there used to be a sanctuary devoted to the goddess Leto.\n\nAccording to mythology Kaunos was founded by King Kaunos, son of the Carian King Miletus and Kyane, and grandson of Apollo. Kaunos had a twin sister by the name of Byblis who developed a deep, unsisterly love for him. When she wrote her brother a love letter, telling him about her feelings, he decided to flee with some of his followers to settle elsewhere. His twin sister became mad with sorrow, started looking for him and tried to commit suicide. Mythology says that the Calbys river emerged from her tears.\n\nThe oldest find at the Kaunos archeological site is the neck of a Protogeometric amphora dating back to the 9th century BC, or even earlier. A statue found at the western gate of the city walls, pieces of imported Attic ceramics and the S-SE oriented city walls show habitation in the 6th century BC. However, none of the architectural finds at Kaunos itself dates back to earlier than the 4th century BC.\n\nKaunos is first referred to by Herodotus in his book Histories. He narrates that the Persian general Harpagus marches against the Lycians, Carians and Kaunians during the Persian invasion of 546 BCE. Herodotus writes that the Kaunians fiercely countered Harpagus' attacks but were ultimately defeated. Despite the fact that the Kaunians themselves said they originated from Crete, Herodotus doubted this. He thought it was far more likely that the Kaunians were the original inhabitants of the area because of the similarity between his own Carian language and that of the Kaunians. He added that there were, however, great differences between the lifestyles of the Kaunians and those of their neighbours, the Carians and Lycians. One of the most conspicuous differences being their social drinking behaviour. It was common practice that the villagers -men, women and children alike- had get-togethers over a good glass of wine.\n\nHerodotus mentions that Kaunos participated in the Ionian Revolt (499–494 BCE).\n\nSome important inscriptions in Carian language were found here, dating to c. 400 BC, including a bilingual inscription in Greek and Carian found in 1996. They helped to decipher the Carian alphabets.\n\nAfter Xerxes I was beaten in the Second Persian War and the Persians were gradually withdrawn from the western Anatolian coast, Kaunos joined the Delian League. Initially they only had to pay 1 talent of tax, an amount that was raised by factor 10 in 425 BC. This indicates that by then the city had developed into a thriving port, possibly due to increased agriculture and the demand for Kaunian export articles, such as salt, salted fish, slaves, pine resin and black mastic – the raw materials for tar used in boat building and repair – and dried figs. During the 5th and 4th centuries BC the city started to use the name Kaunos as an alternative for its ancient name Kbid, because of the increased Hellenistic influence. The myth about the foundation of the city probably dates back to this period.\n\nAfter the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC, Kaunos again came under Persian rule. During the period that Kaunos was annexed and added to the province of Caria by the Persian rulers, the city was drastically changed. This was particularly the case during the reign of the satrap Mausolos (377–353 BC). The city was enlarged, was modeled with terraces and walled over a huge area. The city gradually got a Greek character, with an agora and temples dedicated to Greek deities. Alexander the Great's 334 BC brought the city under the rule of the Macedonian empire.\n\nAfter Alexander's death, Kaunos, due to its strategic location, was disputed among the Diadochi, changing hands between the Antigonids, Ptolemies, and Seleucids.\n\nBecause of differences between the Hellenistic kingdoms, the Roman Republic was able to expand its influence in the area and annex a considerable number of Hellenistic kingdoms. In 189 BC the Roman senate put Kaunos under the jurisdiction of Rhodes. At that time it was known as the Rhodian Peraia.\n\nIn 167 BC this led to a revolt by Kaunos and a number of other cities in western Anatolia against Rhodes. As a result, Rome discharged Rhodes from its task. In 129 BC the Romans established the Province of Asia, which covered a large part of western Anatolia. Kaunos was near the edge of this province and was assigned to Lycia.\n\nIn 88 BC Mithridates invaded the province, trying to curb further expansion by the Romans. The Kaunians teamed up with him and killed all the Roman inhabitants of their city. After the peace of 85 BC they were punished for this action by the Romans, who again put Kaunos under Rhodian administration. During Roman rule Kaunos became a prospering sea port. The amphitheater of the city was enlarged and Roman baths and a palaestra were built. The agora fountain was renovated and new temples arose.\n\nKaunos was christianized at an early date and when the Roman Empire officially adopted the Christian faith, its name changed into Caunos-Hegia.\nFrom 625 AD onwards Kaunos was faced with attacks by Muslim Arabs and pirates. The 13th century brought invasions by Turkish tribes. Consequently, the old castle on the acropolis was fortified with walls, giving it a typical medieval appearance. In the 14th century the Turkish tribes had conquered part of Caria, which resulted in a dramatic decrease in sea trade.\n\nThe resulting economical slump caused many Kaunians to move elsewhere. In the 15th century the Turks captured the entire area north of Caria and Kaunos was hit by a malaria epidemic. This caused the city to be abandoned. The ancient city was badly devastated in an earthquake and gradually got covered with sand and a dense vegetation. The city was forgotten until the English archeologist Hoskyn found a law tablet, referring to the Council of Kaunos and the inhabitants of this city. Hoskyn visited the ruins in 1842 and brought the ancient city under the attention again.\n\nKaunos was christianized at an early date and when the Roman Empire officially adopted the Christian faith, its name changed into Caunos-Hegia.\n\nResidential Bishops are known beginning from the 4th century. Four bishops are mentioned by Lequien : \n\nThe \"Synecdemus\" of Hierocles and most \"Notitiae Episcopatuum\", as late as the 12th or 13th century, place it in Lycia, as a suffragan of Myra.\n\nThe see is included, under the Latinized form of its name, Caunus, among the Latin titular bishoprics recognized by the Catholic Church. since it was nominally restored (no later than 1911), as a suffragan of the Lycian Metropolitan of the capital's Archdiocese of Myra.\n\nIt vacant since 1972, having had the following incumbents, both of the fitting Episcopal (lowest) rank : \n\nKaunos is a site that is interesting for both its archeological and ecological importance.

{"id": "2341244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2341244", "title": "Killer ape theory", "text": "Killer ape theory\n\nThe killer ape theory or killer ape hypothesis is the theory that war and interpersonal aggression was the driving force behind human evolution. It was originated by Raymond Dart in the 1950s; later it was developed further in \"African Genesis\" by Robert Ardrey in 1961.\n\nAccording to the theory, the ancestors of humans were distinguished from other primate species by their greater aggressiveness and this aggression remains within humanity, which retains many murderous instincts.\n\nThe theory gained notoriety for suggesting that the urge to do violence was a fundamental part of human psychology. The hunting hypothesis is often associated with the theory, because of similarities and because Robert Ardrey has developed both.\n\nThe expression \"killer ape\" does not mean an outstanding aggressive kind of ape; in fact the term refers to anthropological analysis of human aggression. Accordingly, the killer ape is a notably belligerent species on which our instincts might be rooted, because this very ancestor could establish itself due to its special aggression.\n\nAs founder of this thesis, Raymond A. Dart (1893–1988) dealt with this issue in his professional article \"The predatory transition from ape to man\", 1953.\n\nDart refers to the Australian anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith (1871–1937), a specialist in anthropology.\n\nThe question is what exactly caused the evolutionary step from ape to human. Basically, there are three versions: the increase of brain size, the acquisition of speech, or upright posture. Smith excludes this last option; otherwise the traditional erect gibbon would be a possible ancestor of humans. For him, the most relevant differentiator was the bigger brain. It would have made the bipedal movement possible and would have accelerated the enlargement through common use of its hands, which are no longer needed for locomotion.\n\nUntil Raymond Dart found the Australopithecus africanus (1925a), this controversial problem could not be solved.\n\nThis approximately 2.5 million year old cranial bone, also known as “Taung Child”, was a first proof of bipedal apes. Robert Broom (1866–1951), primarily a Scottish physician, who spent his life as an archeologist in Australia since 1892, agreed to this statement, too. Five years later he decided to spend the rest of his life in South Africa. His excavations from 1946 pointed into the same direction, when he also discovered bones from the Australopithecus africanus.\n\nHowever, further examinations showed that, in these cases, the size of the brain was not to be equated with the evolution’s level. In fact, it is much more popular to connect the accomplishment of more and more complex movements directly with an evolutionary response, which caused the brain to grow.\n\nBoth Dart and Broom, as well as Charles Darwin (1809–1882), agreed that this new type of locomotion brought a remarkable advantage in comparison to other co-specifics, to rival animals or to the quarry.\n\nOsseous findings at a limestone cave located in Makapan, South-Africa, led to the question to what extent this advantage, in combination with a more and more improved skill using tools, affected the behavior of the apes.\n\nThese findings showed explicit cracks and fractures, which are likely to be done on purpose. Additionally, there were clubs, bludgeons and spears formed by the long limb bones or the horns of antelopes. This new special weapon leaves small punctured, round, and triangular holes in skulls, depending on how it was formed.\n\nThis new development in building weapons shows a clear increase concerning the aggression of the animals.\n\nDart carries that issue to extremes and equips this new type of ‘carnivorous and killing’ apes (“proto-men” in his own words) with weapons. Furthermore, he describes them as organized in a tribe, so they were able to hunt bigger animals. The ability of making fire and remarkable social skills prompt Dart to bring them more in line with humans.\n\nObservations from Sgt. H. B. Potter (Zululand, South Africa) show that this kind of development is still up to date as it is mentioned in \"The predatory transition from ape to man\" by Raymond Dart. He describes a pride of baboons that hunts antelopes. Indeed, he admits that this depends on seasonal circumstances, because nutrition was rare. Nevertheless, he proves explicit behavior.\n\nConcerning the eating habits from then until now, Dart argues that there has always been an ambition to eating meat: grubs and insects, bigger mammals and even human flesh (i.e. distinctive cannibalism) are the results.\n\nA deficit from “animal proteins” has to be compensated, so consuming meat is essential to survive.\n\nThe comment written by the editor of Dart’s article Dr. Alan H. Kelso shows how few scientists accepted the new ideas of Dart and Ardrey. Not only did Dart require a long time to publish his work, but also the epilogue contains notices like: “Professor Dart’s thesis that the South African apemen, at the stage they were found, were omnivorous, must be considered as proven. Of course, they were only the ancestors of the modern Bushmen and Negroes, and of \"nobody else\".”\n\nAnother obvious piece of evidence would be the rejection of Dart’s thesis by a scientific convention at Livingstone (Zambia, Southern Africa), which led Ardrey into writing his book \"African Genesis\". He felt himself forced to defend the opinion of his mentor.\n\nThe ethologist Konrad Lorenz also showed interest in similar ideas, in his book \"On Aggression\" (1963). In his introduction he describes rival butterfly fish defending their territory, leading him to raise the question of whether humans, too, tend to intraspecific conflict.\n\nThe Seville Statement on Violence, released under US auspices in 1986, rejected violence and in particular warfare as genetically determined.\n\nA 2008 article in \"Nature\" by Dan Jones stated that \"A growing number of psychologists, neuroscientists and anthropologists have accumulated evidence that understanding many aspects of antisocial behaviour, including violence and murder, requires the study of brains, genes and evolution, as well as the societies those factors have wrought.\" Evolutionary psychologists generally argue that violence is not done for its own sake but is a by-product of goals such as higher status or reproductive success. Some evolutionary psychologists argue that humans have specific mechanisms for specific forms of violence such as against stepchildren (the Cinderella effect). Chimpanzees have violence between groups which have similarities to raids and violence between human groups in non-state societies. Several studies have found that the death rates from inter-group violence are similar for human non-state societies and chimpanzees. On the other hand, intra-group violence is lower among humans living in small group societies than among chimpanzees. Humans may have a strong tendency to differ between ingroup and outgroup which affects altruistic and aggressive behavior. There is also evidence that both intra-group and inter-group violence were much more prevalent in the recent past and in tribal societies. This suggests that tendencies to use violence in order to achieve goals are affected by society. Reduced inequalities, more available resources, and reduced blood feuds due to better functioning justice systems may have contributed to declining intra-group violence.\n\nThe idea that man is naturally warlike has been refuted in for example the book \"War, Peace, and Human Nature\" (2013), edited by Douglas P. Fry.\n\nMovies such as \"Planet of the Apes\" (1968) show that this issue affected common people, too. In fact, it’s based on Pierre Boulle’s novel of the same title, but the content is almost similar to the topic.\n\nThis theory can be seen in the opening sequence of \"\", and also appears in the television show \"Sliders\", which made extensive use of the killer ape theory in storyline arcs involving the Kromaggs. (The names of \"Dart\" and \"Ardrey\" were combined by the professor Arturo character in the series into \"Drayer\" who purportedly came up with his world's \"killer ape theory\".)\n\n\n"}

It is decided that an interspecific marriage be formed between Aube, the daughter of the human nobleman Arcan, and Loup-de-Feu, the son of the Beast Lord Loup-de-Traille. Aube is not pleased with the arrangement, believing that the product of such a union would be a blasphemy. When the time comes to consummate the marriage, Aube's brother Saliat assassinates Loup-de-Feu, and escapes with his sister while the High Beasts declare the truce null. After the High Beasts indulge in a slaughter, Arcan is approached by Griffe-Tout, a lynx who offers to give him information on his daughter on the condition that he sacrifice a pound of his own flesh to him. He reveals that Saliat has been killed by the High Beasts, while Aube escaped to the Wood of Virgins, an area from only virgins can come out alive.\n\nYears later, the war between the two races has reached a stalemate, with neither side gaining advantage over the other. Though the humans are technologically superior, the High Beasts are physically stronger, more numerous, and have faster growth rates, thus allowing troops to be replenished quicker. In order to break the stalemate, the humans send an envoy, Hugo, to find the banished Lord Clam, who is a famed wolf killer. Under similar orders from his own superior officer, Loup-de-Traille reluctantly accepts to find his eldest and most skilled son, Loup-Gris whom he previously disowned for having married a fox. Loup-de-Traille discovers that his son now has two hybrid children, and refuses to involve himself in the war. Suspecting that his son's wife Lady Goupil has softened him, Loup-de-Traille leaves heavy hearted. Along the way, he finds a band of human bandits attacking a group of foxes. Loup-de-Traille intervenes, but is decapitated by the bandit leader. His body is found by Griffe-Tout and his band of lynxes, and is taken to his son, who decides to form an alliance of High and Low Beasts in order to defeat the human forces. Meanwhile, Hugo discovers a delirious human soldier covered in plant-like growths. Hugo takes him to a monastery, where it is discovered that he found Aube in the Wood of Virgins. The abbot of the monastery reveals himself to be the disgraced Arcan, who offers to aide in the war effort on condition that his daughter be found and returned to him.

{"id": "25873579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25873579", "title": "Matriname", "text": "Matriname\n\nA matrilineal surname or matriname is a family name inherited from one's mother, and maternal grandmother, etc. whose line of descent is called a matriline.\n\nThese existed even before patrinames, which are surnames inherited from one's father.\n\nAlthough the term \"maternal surname\" can be confused with \"matriname\", there is a difference in patrilineal cultures, where the \"maternal\" surname is the mother's patriname. In addition, in some cultures, women inherit a surname from their mother as well as from their father. In such patrilineal cultures, matrinames are able to co-exist with patrinames.\n\nFor example, where matrinames exist, they are passed from mother to child along with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Similarly, where patrinames exist, they are passed from father to son along with Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA). Within a patrilineal culture, if any group of women sharing mtDNA (from their common mother-line ancestor) was to choose a surname and then hand it down to successive generations, by definition, that surname would become a matrilineal surname or matriname within a patrilineal culture. The test of whether a particular surname is a matriname is to determine if it is being handed down from mother to daughter in a \"matriline\".\n\nThe usual lack of matrinames to hand down in patrilineal cultures makes \"traditional genealogy\" more difficult in the mother-line case than in the normal (father-line) case. After all, \"father-line\" surnames originated partly \"to identify\" individuals \"clearly\" and were adopted partly \"for administrative reasons\"; and these \"patrinames\" help in searching for facts and documentation from centuries ago. Patrinames are stable \"identity-surnames\", surnames which identify an individual, whether now or in the past or future; and matrinames similarly are \"identity-surnames\" for women.\n\nIn the 1979 \"Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women,\" or CEDAW, the UN officially adopted a provision, item (g) of CEDAW's Article 16, to the effect that women and men, and specifically wife and husband, shall have the same rights to choose a \"family name\", as well as a \"profession\" and an \"occupation\". These three rights are only a small part of the document's long list of rights related to gender equality meant to ensure women have equal opportunities to men. However, according to the article, the United States has not yet ratified this UN Convention or the multilateral treaty.\n\nIn non-discriminating states, women may eventually gain the same right to their own matriname as men have traditionally had (within father-line cultures) to their own patriname. And similarly, within mother-line or matrilineal cultures, men may gain the right to their own patriname. In other words, the \"handing down of both\" matrinames and patrinames would co-exist within each culture to avoid discriminating against either women or men. (Note that some cultures have \"no\" surnames but if a culture has surnames then in this regard a non-discriminating culture would be a both-lines [mother-line and father-line] or ambilineal culture.)\n\nThe actual use of a matriname would involve, first, invention or choice of a name by a group of women who share mtDNA (from their common matriline ancestor) and then using it in their daughters' birth records (or birth certificates).\n\nThis use of the mother's matriname would be parallel to and symmetric with the normal use of the father's patriname in each new son's birth record. Note well; this \"is\" the above-mentioned \"handing down of both\" the matriname and the patriname.\n\nIt should be mentioned that the \"patriname\" is normally a single surname, like Smith or Jones, normally not a double surname like Smith-Jones or Smith Jones. And, just as men normally do not change their patriname, so also women would normally not change their matriname. Thus, both identity-surnames should be equally stable over the generations.\n\nNote that one's birth surname is one's \"legal surname\", unless one changes the latter such as in some purely patrilineal cultures where women traditionally change to their husband's patriname at marriage, as described in Married and maiden names and in Name change.\n\nHere is a specific example to illustrate and summarize these concepts: the father and sons in a nuclear family have the very-familiar patriname \"Smith\" while the mother and daughters have the matriname \"Momline\" as their own (and thus equally stable) identity-surname.\n\nThe 4 double surname possibilities which combine a matriname with a patriname, in either order, and with or without a hyphen, and which thus provide the aforementioned \"gender symmetry\", are as follows: matriname patriname, matriname-patriname, patriname matriname, and patriname-matriname. The patrilineal surname or patriname that is received from the mother in patrilineal cultures does not qualify as a matriname, as stated in the preceding section.\n\n3 of the 4 possibilities enumerated above are used together in the example below. Such conventions of double surnames were proposed in \"The Seven Daughters of Eve\", and an English family with the matriname \"Phythian\" actually used one of them, as demonstrated and discussed in an online \"feature\" article.\n\nAs a hypothetical example of these double surnames, let the matrinames be \"Mamaname\" and \"Momline\" and the patrinames be \"Smith\" and \"Jones\". The mother, with birth double surname \"Momline-Jones\", and the father, with birth double surname \"Mamaname Smith\", both choose to retain their birth double surnames unchanged throughout their lives and agree in some wise to denominate all of their daughters and sons with the birth double surname \"Smith Momline\": The mother hands down her matriname and, symmetrically, the father hands down his patriname. All of their sons have the Y-DNA of and, accordingly, the patriname \"Smith\" of their patriline, while all of the daughters have both the mtDNA of and, accordingly, the matriname \"Momline\" of their matriline. (Note that most societies give all children of a family the same surname, as in this example.) Thus, each person has only one identity-surname, which in this example is either \"Momline\" or \"Smith\". The identity-surname of each is stable throughout life and always half of whatever double surname(s) he or she assumes throughout life, including at birth and marriage(s).\n\nThe family in this hypothetical example could choose to adopt a convention, given its 3 co-existing surnames \"Momline-Jones\", \"Mamaname Smith\", and \"Smith Momline\", of all members using only one family \"usage name\" in daily social life. Possible samples of this family's usage name might be any one of its 3 co-existing double surnames; one of its identity-surnames \"Momline\" or \"Smith\"; or an invented surname, e. g., \"Momith\", which combines \"Momline\" and \"Smith\". Single surname families could use such usage names also. There is some relevant discussion in this footnote. This family's 3 surnames, however, \"should\" be used in their respective members' personal legal documents, and could also be used otherwise such as in the respective members' personal profession/vocation.\n\nRather than keeping their own birth or legal surnames, the parents in this example might prefer \"at marriage\" to change their surnames to \"Smith Momline\", the same as their children-to-be, so that the members of their nuclear family would all share this one surname.\n\nOf course, one's own identity-surname (here, the matriname \"Momline\" or the patriname \"Smith\") would always be available as one's own usage name, such as in one's profession/vocation.\n\nThis double surname example should be compared with its single surname counterpart at the end of the preceding section.\n\nIn toto, the gender-symmetric single surnames presented in the preceding section have the advantage of being simpler and briefer, but if used alone, would give \"different\" surnames for members of the different genders in a nuclear family. In contrast, all of the children in a nuclear family would have the \"same double\" surname. Also, these double surnames would \"record\" on legal documents both the matriname and patriname, with \"both\" identity-surnames later aiding \"each\" gender in genealogy and other searches of historical records.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7803345", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7803345", "title": "Mental reservation", "text": "Mental reservation\n\nThe doctrine of mental reservation, or of mental equivocation, was a special branch of casuistry (case-based reasoning) developed in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and most often associated with the Jesuits.\n\nMental reservation is a form of deception which is not an outright lie. It was argued for in moral theology, and now in ethics, as a way to fulfill obligations both to tell the truth and to keep secrets from those not entitled to know them (for example, because of the seal of the confessional or other clauses of confidentiality). Mental reservation, however, is regarded as unjustifiable without grave reason for withholding the truth. This condition was necessary to preserve a general idea of truth in social relations.\n\nIn wide mental reservation, equivocations and amphibologies are used to imply an untruth that is not actually stated. In strict mental reservation, the speaker mentally adds some qualification to the words which they utter, and the words together with the mental qualification make a true assertion in accordance with fact.\n\nA frequently cited example of equivocation is a well-known incident from the life of Athanasius of Alexandria. When Julian the Apostate was seeking Athanasius's death, Athanasius fled Alexandria and was pursued up the Nile. Seeing the imperial officers were gaining on him, Athanasius took advantage of a bend in the river that hid his boat from its pursuers and ordered his boat turned around. When the two boats crossed paths, the Roman officers shouted out, asking if anyone had seen Athanasius. As instructed by Athanasius, his followers shouted back, \"Yes, he is not very far off.\" The pursuing boat hastily continued up the river, while Athanasius returned to Alexandria, where he remained in hiding until the end of the persecution.\n\nAnother anecdote often used to illustrate equivocation concerns Francis of Assisi. He once saw a man fleeing from a murderer. When the murderer then came upon Francis, he demanded to know if his quarry had passed that way. Francis answered, \"He did not pass this way,\" sliding his forefinger into the sleeve of his cassock, thus misleading the murderer and saving a life. A variant of this anecdote is cited by the canonist Martin de Azpilcueta to illustrate his doctrine of a mixed speech (\"oratoria mixta\") combining speech and gestural communication.\n\nThe Bible contains a good example of equivocation. Abraham was married to Sarah/Sarai, his half-sister by a different mother. Fearing that as he traveled people would covet his beautiful wife and as a result kill him to take her, he counselled her to agree with him when he would say that \"she is my sister.\" This happened on two occasions, first with the Pharaoh of Egypt, told in Genesis 12:11-13, and second, with a king called Abimelech in Gen 20:12.\n\nThe 16th-century Spanish theologian Martin de Azpilcueta (often called \"Navarrus\" because he was born in the Kingdom of Navarre) wrote at length about the doctrine of \"mentalis restrictio\" or mental reservation. Navarrus held that mental reservation involved truths \"expressed partly in speech and partly in the mind,\" relying upon the idea that God hears what is in one's mind while human beings hear only what one speaks. Therefore, the Christian's moral duty was to tell the truth to God. Reserving some of that truth from the ears of human hearers was moral if it served a greater good. This is the doctrine of strict mental reservation. A user of the doctrine could reply aloud \"I know not\" to a human interlocutor, and \"to tell you\" silently to God, and still be telling the truth (\"stricte mentalis\").\n\nTraditionally, the doctrine of mental reservation was intimately linked with the concept of equivocation, which allowed the speaker to employ double meanings of words to tell the \"literal\" truth while concealing a deeper meaning. Navarrus, however, went beyond this, giving the doctrine of mental reservation a far broader and more liberal interpretation than had anyone up to that time. Although some other Catholic theological thinkers and writers took up the argument in favor of strict mental reservation, the concept remained controversial within the Roman Catholic Church, which never officially endorsed or upheld the doctrine and eventually condemned it.\n\nThe linked doctrines of mental reservation and equivocation became notorious in England during the Elizabethan era and the Jacobean era, when Jesuits who had entered England to minister to the spiritual needs of Catholics were captured by the authorities. The Jesuits Robert Southwell (c. 1561–1595) (who was also a poet of note) and Henry Garnet (1555–1606) both wrote treatises on the topic, which was of far more than academic interest to them. Both risked their lives bringing the sacraments to recusant Catholics — and not only \"their\" lives, since sheltering a priest was a capital offence. In 1586, Margaret Clitherow had been pressed to death for refusing to enter a plea on the charge of harbouring two priests at York. When caught, tortured and interrogated, Southwell and Garnet practiced mental reservation not to save themselves — their deaths were a foregone conclusion — but to protect their fellow believers.\n\nSouthwell, who was arrested in 1592, was accused at his trial of having told a witness that even if she was forced by the authorities to swear under oath, it was permissible to lie to conceal the whereabouts of a priest. Southwell replied that that was not what he had said. He had said that \"to an oath were required justice, judgement and truth\", but the rest of his answer goes unrecorded because one of the judges angrily shouted him down. Convicted in 1595, Southwell was hanged, drawn and quartered. More famous in his own era was Henry Garnet, who wrote a defense of Southwell in 1598; Garnet was captured by the authorities in 1606 due to his alleged involvement in the Gunpowder Plot. Facing the same accusations as Southwell, his attempts to defend himself met with no better result: later that year Garnet was executed in the same fashion.\n\nThe Protestants considered these doctrines as mere justifications for lies. Catholic ethicists also voiced objections: the Jansenist \"Blaise Pascal...attacked the Jesuits in the seventeenth century for what he saw as their moral laxity.\" \"By 1679, the doctrine of strict mental reservation put forward by Navarrus had become such a scandal that Pope Innocent XI officially condemned it.\" Other casuists justifying mental reservation included Thomas Sanchez, who was criticized by Pascal in his \"Provincial Letters\" – although Sanchez added various restrictions (it should not be used in ordinary circumstances, when one is interrogated by competent magistrates, when a creed is requested, even for heretics, etc.), which were ignored by Pascal. Of the 26 theses condemned by Pope Innocent XI, several were in Sanchez's works (see op. mor. in præc. Decalogi, III, vi, n. 15). One of them stated:\n\nThis type of equivocation was famously mocked in the porter's speech in Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\", in which the porter directly alludes to the practice of deceiving under oath by means of equivocation.\n\nSee, for example Robert Southwell and Henry Garnet, author of \"A Treatise of Equivocation\" (published secretly c. 1595)—to whom, it is supposed, Shakespeare was specifically referring. Shakespeare made the reference to priests because the religious use of equivocation was well known in those periods of early modern England (e.g. under James VI/I) when it was a capital offence for a Roman Catholic priest to enter England. A Jesuit priest would equivocate in order to protect himself from the secular authorities without (in his eyes) committing the sin of lying. For example, he could use the ambiguity of the word \"a\" (meaning \"any\" or \"one\") to say \"I swear I am not a priest\", because he could have a particular priest in mind who he was not. That is, in his mind, he was saying \"I swear I am not one priest\" (e.g. \"I am not Father Brown\".)\n\nAccording to Malloch and Huntley (1966), this doctrine of permissible \"equivocation\" did not originate with the Jesuits. They cite a short treatise, \"\", that had been written by Martin Azpilcueta (also known as Doctor Navarrus), an Augustinian who was serving as a consultant to the Apostolic Penitentiary. It was published in Rome in 1584. The first Jesuit influence upon this doctrine was not until 1609, \"when Suarez rejected Azpilcueta's basic proof and supplied another\" (speaking of Francisco Suárez).\n\nFollowing Innocent XI's condemnation of strict mental reservation, equivocation (or wide mental reservation) was still considered orthodox, and was revived and defended by Alphonsus Liguori. The Jesuit Gabriel Daniel wrote in 1694 \"Entretiens de Cleanthe et d'Eudoxe sur les lettres provinciales\", a reply to Pascal's \"Provincial Letters\" in which he accused Pascal of lying, or even of having himself used mental reservation, by not mentioning all the restrictions imposed by Sanchez on the use of this form of deception.\n\nThis type of untruth was condemned by Kant in \"On a supposed 'right to lie’\". Kant was debating against Benjamin Constant, who had claimed, from a consequentialist stance opposed to Kant's categorical imperative, that:\nOn the other hand, Kant asserted, in the \"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\", that lying, or deception of any kind, would be forbidden under any interpretation and in any circumstance. In \"Groundwork\", Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty) because it would logically contradict the reliability of language. If it is universally acceptable to lie, then no one would believe anyone and all truths would be assumed to be lies (this last clause was accepted by casuists, hence the reasons for restrictions given to the cases where deception was authorized). The right to deceive could also not be claimed because it would deny the status of the person deceived as an end in himself. And the theft would be incompatible with a possible kingdom of ends. Therefore, Kant denied the right to lie or deceive for any reason, regardless of context or anticipated consequences. However, it was permissible to remain silent or say no more than needed (such as in the infamous example of a murderer asking to know where someone is).\n\nThe doctrines have also been criticized by Sissela Bok and by Paul Ekman, who defines lies by omission as the main form of lying – though larger and more complex moral and ethical issues of lying and truth-telling extend far beyond these specific doctrines. Ekman, however, does not consider cases of deception where \"it is improper to question\" the truth as real form of deceptions – this sort of case, where communication of truth is not to be expected and so deception is justified, was included by casuists.\n\nBill Clinton famously equivocated, during his trial during the Lewinsky scandal, \"It depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is.\"\n\nSocial psychologists have advanced cases where the actor is confronted with an avoidance-avoidance conflict, in which he both doesn't want to say the truth and doesn't want to make an outright lie; in such circumstances, equivocal statements are generally preferred. This type of equivocation has been defined as “nonstraightforward communication...ambiguous, contradictory, tangential, obscure or even evasive.” People typically equivocate when posed a question to which all of the possible replies have potentially negative consequences, yet a reply is still expected (the situational theory of communicative conflict).\n\nThe Irish Catholic Church allegedly misused the concept of mental reservation when dealing with situations relating to clerical child sexual abuse, by disregarding the restrictions placed on its employment by moral theologians and treating it as a method that \"allows clerics (to) mislead people...without being guilty of lying\", for example when dealing with the police, victims, civil authorities and media. In the Murphy Report into the Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin, Cardinal Desmond Connell describes it thus:\n\nCathleen Kaveny, writing in the Catholic magazine \"Commonweal\", notes that Henry Garnet in his treatise on the topic took pains to argue that no form of mental reservation was justified — and might even be a mortal sin — if it would run contrary to the requirements of faith, charity or justice. But according to the Murphy Report:\n\nKaveny concludes: \"The truths of faith are illuminated by the lives of the martyrs. Southwell and Garnet practiced mental reservation to save innocent victims while sacrificing themselves. The Irish prelates practiced mental reservation to save themselves while sacrificing innocent victims. And that difference makes all the difference.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "365038", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=365038", "title": "Negative and positive atheism", "text": "Negative and positive atheism\n\nNegative atheism, also called weak atheism and soft atheism, is any type of atheism where a person does not believe in the existence of any deities but does not explicitly assert that there are none. Positive atheism, also called strong atheism and hard atheism, is the form of atheism that additionally asserts that no deities exist.\n\nThe terms \"negative atheism\" and \"positive atheism\" were used by Antony Flew in 1976 and have appeared in George H. Smith's and Michael Martin's writings since 1990.\n\nBecause of flexibility in the term \"god\", it is possible that a person could be a positive/strong atheist in terms of certain conceptions of God, while remaining a negative/weak atheist in terms of others. For example, the God of classical theism is often considered to be a personal supreme being who is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent, caring about humans and human affairs. One might be a positive atheist for such a deity (see problem of evil), while being a negative atheist with respect to a deistic conception of God by rejecting belief in such a deity but not explicitly asserting it to be false.\n\nPositive and negative atheism are frequently used by the philosopher George H. Smith as synonyms of the less-well-known categories of implicit and explicit atheism, also relating to whether an individual holds a specific view that gods do not exist. \"\"Positive\" atheists explicitly assert that it is false that any deities exist. \"Negative\"\" atheists assert they do not believe any deities exist, but do not explicitly assert it is \"true\" that no deity exists. Those who do not believe any deities exist, but do not assert such non-belief, are included among \"implicit atheists\". Among \"implicit\" atheists are thus included the following: children and adults who have never heard of deities; people who have heard of deities but have never given the idea any considerable thought; and those agnostics who suspend belief about deities, but do not reject such belief. All \"implicit\" atheists are included in the \"negative/weak\" categorization.\n\nUnder the negative atheism classification, agnostics atheists. The validity of this categorization is disputed, however, and a few prominent atheists such as Richard Dawkins avoid it. In \"The God Delusion\", Dawkins describes people for whom the probability of the existence of God is between \"very high\" and \"very low\" as \"agnostic\" and reserves the term \"strong atheist\" for those who claim to know there is no God. He categorizes himself as a \"de facto atheist\" but \"not\" a \"strong atheist\" on this scale. Within negative atheism, philosopher Anthony Kenny further distinguishes between agnostics, who find the claim \"God exists\" uncertain, and theological noncognitivists, who consider all talk of gods to be meaningless.\n\nJacques Maritain used the negative/positive phrases as early as 1949, but with a different meaning and in the context of a strictly Catholic apologist.\n\nGoparaju Ramachandra Rao (1902–1975), better known by his nickname Gora, was an Indian social reformer, anti-caste activist, and atheist. He proposed a philosophy he called \"positive atheism\", which treated atheism as a way of life in his 1972 book, \"Positive Atheism\".\n\nSimilarly, the Atheist Community of Austin (ACA) uses the term \"positive atheism\" in the sense of putting a positive face to atheism and dispelling the false and negative image of atheism portrayed by religious people, especially in places of worship. \"Positive Atheism Magazine\" \"sees atheism as being a positive, healthy outlook -- much healthier than any theistic approach to life.\"\n\nAgnostics are not always merely implicit atheists. For instance, Philip Pullman, the English author of the \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy, which has atheism as a major theme, is an explicit atheist, but also describes himself as technically an agnostic.\n\n"}

Today's propaganda is characterised by psych-ops and disinformation, whereas a few decades ago it was dominated by posters and simple films.\n\nIn the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, psychological operations tactics were employed to demoralise the Taliban and to win the sympathies of the Afghan population. At least six EC-130E Commando Solo aircraft were used to jam local radio transmissions and transmit replacement propaganda messages. Leaflets were also dropped throughout Afghanistan, offering rewards for Osama bin Laden and other individuals, portraying Americans as friends of Afghanistan and emphasising various negative aspects of the Taliban. Another shows a picture of Mohammed Omar in a set of crosshairs with the words: \"We are watching.\"\n\nBoth the United States and Iraq employed propaganda during the Iraq War. The United States established campaigns towards the American people on the justifications of the war while using similar tactics to bring down Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq.\n\nThe Iraqi insurgency's plan was to gain as much support as possible by using violence as their propaganda tool. Inspired by the Vietcong's tactics, insurgents were using rapid movement to keep the coalition off-balance. By using low-technology strategies to convey their messages, they were able to gain support. Graffiti slogans were used on walls and houses praising the virtues of many group leaders while condemning the Iraqi government. Others used flyers, leaflets, articles and self-published newspapers and magazines to get the point across.\n\nInsurgents also produced CDs and DVDs and distributed them in communities that the Iraq and the US Government were trying to influence. The insurgents designed advertisements that cost a fraction of what the US was spending on their ads aimed at the same people in Iraq with much more success. In addition, a domestic Arabic language television station was established with the aim of informing the Iraqi public of alleged coalition propaganda efforts in the country.\n\nTo achieve their aim of a moderate, pro-western Iraq, US authorities were careful to avoid conflicts with Islamic culture that would produce passionate reactions from Iraqis, but differentiating between \"good\" and \"bad\" Islam has proved challenging for the US.\n\nThe US implemented black propaganda by creating false radio personalities that would disseminate pro-American information, but supposedly run by the supporters of Saddam Hussein. One radio station used was \"Radio Tikrit\". Another example of use of black propaganda is that the United States paid Iraqis to publish articles written by US troops in their newspapers under the idea that they are unbiased and real accounts; this was brought forth by \"The New York Times\" in 2005. The article stated that it was the Lincoln Group who had been hired by the US government to create the propaganda. However, their names were later cleared from any wrongdoing.\n\nThe US was more successful with the \"Voice of America\" campaign, which is an old Cold War tactic that exploited people's desire for information. While the information they gave out to the Iraqis was truthful, they were in a high degree of competition with the opposing forces after the censorship of the Iraqi media was lifted with the removal of Saddam from power.\n\nIn November 2005, the \"Chicago Tribune\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\" alleged that the United States military had manipulated news reported in Iraqi media in an effort to cast a favourable light on its actions while demoralising the insurgency. Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a military spokesman in Iraq, said the program is \"an important part of countering misinformation in the news by insurgents\", while a spokesman for former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said the allegations of manipulation were troubling if true. The Department of Defense confirmed the existence of the program.\n\nThe extent to which the US government used propaganda aimed at its own people is a matter of discussion. The book \"Selling Intervention & War,\" by Jon Western, argued that president Bush was \"selling the war\" to the public.\n\nPresident George W. Bush gave a talk at the Athena Performing Arts Centre, at Greece Athena Middle and High School, Tuesday, May 24, 2005, in Rochester, New York. About halfway through the event, Bush said: \"See, in my line of work, you got to keep repeating things over and over, and over again, for the truth to sink in, to kind of catapult the propaganda.\"\n\nPeople had their initial reactions to the War on Terror. While the United States' official stance was to remove Saddam Hussein's power in Iraq with allegations that his government held weapons of mass destruction or was related to Osama Bin Laden, over time the Iraq war as a whole has been seen in a negative light. Video and picture coverage in the news has shown images of torture and other PR disasters being done under the Iraqi Government.\n\nEvery year, a state-owned publishing house releases several cartoons (called \"geurim-chaek\" in North Korea), many of which are smuggled across the Chinese border and, sometimes, end up in university libraries in the United States. The books are designed to instill the \"Juche\" philosophy of Kim Il-sung (the \"father\" of North Korea)—radical self-reliance of the state. The plots mostly feature scheming capitalists from the United States and Japan who create dilemmas for naïve North Korean characters.\n\nDPRK textbooks claim that US missionaries came to the Korean Peninsula and committed barbarous acts against Korean children, including injecting dangerous liquids into the children and writing the word \"THIEF\" on the forehead of any child who stole an apple for missionary-owned orchards in Korea.\n\nDrug cartels have been engaged in propaganda and psychological campaigns to influence their rivals and those within their area of influence. They use banners and \"narcomantas\" to threaten their rivals. Some cartels hand out pamphlets and leaflets to conduct public relation campaigns. They have been able to control the information environment by threatening journalists, bloggers and others who speak out against them. They have elaborate recruitment strategies targeting young adults to join their cartel groups. They have successfully branded the word \"narco\", and the word has become part of Mexican culture. There is music, television shows, literature, beverages, food and architecture that all have been branded \"narco\".\n\nThe Shared values initiative was a public relations campaign that was intended to sell a \"new\" America to Muslims around the world by showing that American Muslims were living happily and freely, without persecution, in post-9/11 America. Funded by the United States Department of State, the campaign created a public relations front group known as Council of American Muslims for Understanding (CAMU). The campaign was divided in phases; the first of which consisted of five mini-documentaries for television, radio, and print with shared values messages for key Muslim countries.\n\nPropaganda is used by the Communist Party of China to sway public and international opinion in favour of its policies. Domestically, this includes censorship of proscribed views and an active cultivation of views that favour the government. Propaganda is considered central to the operation of the Chinese government. The term in general use in China, \"xuanchuan\" (宣傳 \"propaganda; publicity\") can have either a neutral connotation in official government contexts or a pejorative connotation in informal contexts. Some \"xuanchuan\" collocations usually refer to \"propaganda\" (e.g., \"xuānchuánzhàn\" 宣传战 \"propaganda war\"), others to \"publicity\" (\"xuānchuán méijiè\" 宣傳媒介 \"mass media; means of publicity\"), and still others are ambiguous (\"xuānchuányuán\" 宣传员 \"propagandist; publicist\").\n\nAspects of propaganda can be traced back to the earliest periods of Chinese history, but propaganda has been most effective in the twentieth century owing to mass media and an authoritarian government. China in the era of Mao Zedong is known for its constant use of mass campaigns to legitimise the state and the policies of leaders. It was the first Chinese government to successfully make use of modern mass propaganda techniques, adapting them to the needs of a country which had a largely rural and illiterate population. In poor developing countries, China spreads propaganda through methods such as opening Confucius Institutes, and providing training programs in China for foreign officials and students.\n\nPosters hanging everywhere often describe unity of the working class, farmers and soldiers under the leadership of the Communist Party of Vietnam and Ho Chi Minh. Residents and students have been studying ethics and ideology of Ho Chi Minh.\n"}
{"id": "657155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=657155", "title": "Popayán", "text": "Popayán\n\nPopayán () is the capital of the Colombian department of Cauca. It is located in southwestern Colombia between Colombia's Western Mountain Range and Central Mountain Range. It has a population of 258,653 people, an area of 512 km, is located 1760 meters above sea level, and has an average temperature of 18 °C.\nThis town is well-known for its colonial architecture and its contributions to Colombian cultural and political life. It is also known as the \"white city\" due to the color of most of the colonial buildings in the city center, where several churches are located, such as San Francisco, San José, Belén, Santo Domingo, San Agustín, and the Catedral Basílica Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, known locally as \"La Catedral\". The city's cathedral was home to the Crown of the Andes, a 16th-century Marianist devotional object featuring emeralds taken from the captured Inca Emperor Atahualpa. It was sold to finance local health care institutions.\n\nPopayán has been home to seventeen Colombian presidents, as well as noted poets, painters, and composers. The University of Cauca (est. 1827), one of Colombia's oldest and most distinguished institutions of higher education, is located here, so Popayán is also known as the \"University City.\" Nearby is Puracé National Natural Park. The nearest large city is Cali, in the Valle del Cauca Department, north of Cauca.\n\nMuch of the city's original splendor was destroyed on 31 March 1983, when an earthquake toppled many buildings. Though many were rebuilt and repaired, the heart of the city still has ruins and empty lots. In 2005, Popayán was declared by the UNESCO as the first city of gastronomy because of its variety and meaning to the intangible patrimony of Colombian culture. The culinary history of the Cauca Department was chosen because it maintains traditional food preparation methods which has been passed down orally for generations. In 2009 UNESCO also declared the Semana Santa processions during Easter Week a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Patrimony of Humanity.\n\nThe word Popayán comes from an indigenous language. There are different theories about the origin of this word, one claims it means: \"Po\": \"Two\"; \"pa\": \"reed\"; \"yan\": \"village\", or; \"Two villages with reed roofs\". Another theory says that the word Popayán comes from the name of the indigenous \"cacique\", called \"Payán\", who used to live around Eme Hill, nowadays known as Las Tres Cruces Hill. Yet another theory says that according to the historian Arcecio Aragón, the origin of the word Popayán is \"Pampayán\" and it comes from the Quechua language: \"pampa\" (valley) and \"yan\" (river), or in other words, the \"Valley of the river\", where river refers to the Cauca River.\n\nNo records exist of the pre-Hispanic history of the indigenous village of Popayán, but on 13 January 1537 the Spanish conquistador Sebastián de Belalcázar arrived in Popayán. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Popayán was administered by an appointed governor under the jurisdiction of the Royal Audience of Quito.\n\nPopayán was a very important town during the colonial period because of its location between Lima, Quito and Cartagena. Even after the discovery of the Pacific Ocean, Popayán remained a transfer point for gold and other riches going to Cartagena on their way to Spain. Popayán also served as a colonial mine, and produced various denominations of gold escudo coins and silver reales from 1760 through 1819; it continued producing coinage for the new Republic of Colombia after 1826. \nThe city is the home of an ancient pre-Hispanic pyramid known as El Morro del Tulcán, already abandoned when the first Spanish arrived. Analyses of dental samples have revealed that individuals buried there probably belonged to the upper class of their society.\n\nPopayán has been destroyed by several earthquakes. The most recent and destructive lasted eighteen seconds and occurred on 31 March 1983. The reconstruction of the colonial city took more than ten years and today it is still possible to see some lots that have not been rebuilt. The first earthquake seismic design code was established in Colombia as a consequence of this earthquake.\n\nPopayán's historic downtown is considered one of the most beautiful and best preserved in Colombia and Latin America. Popayán has preserved its colonial architecture for more than four centuries. The cobblestone streets were almost all paved in 1937; however, a few projects currently seek to recover the old city's original look.\n\nEl morro del tulcán is the main archaeological site of Popayán. It consists of a truncated pyramid built between 500 and 1600 A.C., a period known as late chiefdom societies. To commemorate the 400th anniversary of the city's founding, a monument was erected in 1937 in honor of city founder Sebastián de Belalcázar, with an equestrian statue by Spanish artist Victorio Macho.\n\nBetter known as the Paraninfo, this imposing mid-18th-century building was part of the Dominican order monastery until 1826. It was first built with a mud and straw roof, then reinforced over the years with rammed earth and tile. In 1827 Simón Bolivar declared it a property with historic heritage value, when it was already a two steps hose in front of the Santo Domingo plaza. The last great governor of Cauca, don Miguel de Arroyo Hurtado, made more renovations and reforms that gave it the most current look. When the building was given to the University of Cauca in the early twentieth century, several changes and additional extensions were made, which recovered all the original spaces. \nThis park was born at the same time as Popayán in 1537, when the track in grid generated around religious, governmental, and founders buildings. Initially it was a marketplace. In 1538 it was placed a trap in the center of the park, where Jorge Robledo and Álvaro Oyón were beheaded. This trap lasted until 1766 when it was replaced by a water faucet, until 1805 when a stone pile was put in its place, but it was removed too in 1910 after the inauguration of the monument to Sabio Caldas, a piece by the French sculptor , which has remained there since. A replica of it exists in the Plazoleta de las Nieves in Bogotá. Leafy trees were planted at this time. In May 2007 a proposal by architect Lorenzo Castro aimed to expand the pedestrian zone around the park, and in April 2009 the first phase of the work began.\n\nThe university gathers students from around the country. It was founded in 1827 by decree of General Francisco de Paula Santander. Its motto is \"Posteris Lumen Moriturus Edat\". Since the beginning of the twentieth century, the main headquarters have been in the Dominican Order cloister, one of the best examples of religious architecture in the city.\n\nCalled \"the nose of Popayán\" by Guillermo Valencia, the clock tower is a well-known symbol of the city. It was built next to the cathedral between 1673 and 1682 with 96,000 bricks. The clock, made in England, was placed in 1737. Its mechanism operated by the action of two lead weights which were changed by Antonio Nariño in the Colombia independence dispute in 1814, when metal was required to manufacture ammunition.\n\nAfter the earthquake of 1983, the clock was restored and put back in operation by the same English company that had manufactured it, but it has since stopped working.\n\nThis bridge connects the central and northern zones of the city. It was built in 1873 on arches of brick and masonry. The designs were prepared by the Italian friar Fray Serafin Barbetti and a German engineer whose mummified remains are preserved in the Archdiocesan Museum of Religious Art. The bridge crosses a fault between the city center and the El Callejón (now Bolivar) neighborhood which was previously extremely difficult to cross, requiring pedestrians to almost crawl on their knees. Accordingly, the new bridge was named \"Humilladero\". \nFor a long time this bridge was one of the main entrances to the city. The liberating armies crossed it to enter Popayán during the early stages of the struggle for Colombia independence. Its well-planned design and strong construction has allowed the bridge to remain intact through many earthquakes.\n\nThis country house was built in the 17th Century. On its grounds a battle was fought for the independence of Colombia on January 15, 1814.\n\nAccording to the architect, critic and historian Germain Téllez, the facade of this church is the best example of baroque style in Colombia. In its tower is a famous bell donated by Don Pedro Agustín de Valencia. This temple is remarkable because of its altar decorations and the proportions of its naves and apse. In San Francisco's square stands a monument to local hero Camilo Torres, whose replica is located in the square of the Colegio Mayor de San Bartolomé in Bogotá.\n\nLate Neogranadino Baroque work, designed by the Spanish architect Antonio Garcia. It has excellent examples of architectures, metal works, and furniture from Quito and Spain schools. His pulpit was designed in the first half of the nineteenth century by an illustrious son of the city, Francisco José de Caldas. Next to this church is the faculty of Law and Political and Social Sciences of the University of Cauca, also in colonial style.\n\nFray Jeronimo Escobar founded the convent of the Augustinians in the late seventeenth century, whose temple was destroyed in the earthquake in 1736. Then, it was reconstructed thanks to contributions from notable people of the city, but it was necessary to restore it again after the earthquake of 1983. In particular it stands out its altar carved in wood and covered in gold, its expository baroque made in silver and a beautiful image of the Lady of Sorrows.\n\nIt is the oldest church in the city and sometimes it served as \"Pro Tempore\" Cathedral. It dates from 1546 and contains a fine altar discovered after the earthquake of 1983. The principal attraction of this church is the street because its road is made of stones, like old roads in Popayán.\n\nOriginally it was a straw hut, but in 1609 it was opened a second cathedral of mud and masonry. The current construction was consecrated in 1906 by Archbishop Manuel Antonio Arboleda, who brings it a magnificent European pipe organ. Its style is the neoclassical, and much of the building was restored because of the earthquake of 1983, including the great dome of 40 meters high, whose restoration was made according to guidelines of the original structure designed by the local artist Adolfo Dueñas.\n\nIt was built in 1702 according to the architectural guidelines of the Jesuits in the American Baroque. It has put up with some changes, for example, the most recent occurred in 1983, when much of the facade which had been covered with paint and lime for at least two centuries, was left on view.\n\nIt is located on the hill of Belén, and from the chapel you can see a panoramic view of the city. To arrive to this church, it is necessary to pass through the “quingos\", a road of stone steps that allow a nice climb to one of the viewpoints of the city.\n\nSince 1717 this chapel is in charge of the image of Santo Ecce Homo, patron saint of the city. Next to the church there is a cross of quarry stone of 1789, which are attributed to many legends. The original church was completely replaced by a new structure after the earthquake of 1983.\n\nThis house displays a very interesting collection of colonial art and precious memories of the Mosquera family. This house is administrated by Universidad del Cauca.\nIt works in the house that belonged to the Mosquera Arboleda family, a recognized family in the history of Colombia, whose members occupied the highest positions of political power, ecclesiastical, military and diplomatic, simultaneously during much of the nineteenth century. The most important were: Joaquín Mosquera, Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, Manuel José Mosquera and Manuel Maria Mosquera. The father of them all, Jose Maria Mosquera y Figueroa, was considered by the Liberator Simón Bolívar as the only person he would choose as a second parent.\n\nThe old residence of the Arboleda family, was built in the eighteenth century based on plans of the priest Andres Perez Marcelino Arroyo, and it was acquired by the city in 1974 and renovated for its current use in 1979. Their collections are extraordinary examples of religious art, silverware, pictures of the so-called Quito School and paintings of the colonial period. Monstrances of the collection have such value that they are only exposed to the public for a few days during Easter.\n\nIt is located in a mansion on the Próceres street, and it is dedicated to the poet Guillermo Valencia, one of the most prominent members of Modernism in Spanish literature. Its numerous rooms are decorated with valuable works of art and artistic pieces, as well as a collection of hundred of selected books, diplomas, medals and awards that Master Valencia received for his distinguished political life and for its fine literary and poetic compositions. In the park located across the street it stands the statue of the poet, made by the Spanish sculptor Victorio Macho. It has too a family cemetery where the remains of several generations of Valencia are resting.\n\nThe museum depends on the University of Cauca. It offers an exhibition of animals, like insects, butterflies and birds native to the region, and a collection of pre-Columbian pottery.\n\nPopayán is widely known for the solemnity of its Holy Week processions, during which it commemorates the passion and death of Jesus Christ. Since roughly the mid-sixteenth century - documents in the historical archives of Popayán mention processions in the year 1558 - sacred processions have taken place each night from Tuesday until Holy Saturday, with ancient religious images paraded through Popayán's historical downtown streets. They are borne on wooden platforms by means of four projecting wooden \"bars\" at the front and four at the back. These bars rest on the shoulders of the “cargueros”, responsible for carrying the platforms.\n\nThese processions represent episodes from the Gospels, relating the Passion, crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ. Each representation is called a \"Paso\". Since the time of the conquest the pasos have been carried through the streets on the shoulders of the traditional 'cargueros' in a route shaped like a cross, which takes in the main churches and temples of the city. Since 2009 the Popayán Holy Week processions have been inscribed in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.\n\nDuring Holy Week, Popayán is also home to the Festival de Música Religiosa (Religious Music Festival), begun in the 1960s by Edmundo Mosquera Troya. This festival presents choirs, soloists and artists from around the world, specialists in sacred music. \nIt is also the tradition at this time of the year to hold art and craft fairs selling handicrafts and commercial products. One of the most important handicrafts samples is Manos de Oro, which displays the works of artists of Colombia.\n\nAmo Jesus Nazareno of Puelenje is a Catholic devotional image located in the church of Puelenje, part of the metropolitan area of Popayán, Colombia. Amo Jesus is the patron of the parish of Puelenje. The image is a polychrome baroque wooden sculpture of Jesus Christ carved in the eighteenth century in the style of the Quito school. The image is processed on the Wednesday as part of the expression of popular piety celebrated in Popayán during Holy Week (see above). A festival in honour of Amo Jesus as patron of the parish is celebrated with fireworks, processions, religious ceremonies and cultural events beginning on the 15th day before the last Sunday in August each year.\n\nPopayán celebrates these festivities at the beginning of the year, from January 5 to 13. These \"fiestas\" celebrate the spirit of racial diversity in the country, in the same way as the Carnival of Blacks and Whites, which takes place in the same week, in Pasto, which originally initiated in Popayán during the slavery period as a way of escaping the racial discrimination prevailing at the time.\n\nIt is said that among the original performers there were good music interpreters, excelling in playing the chirimía, that is made up of flutes (transverse cane), guacharacas, drums, castrueras and triángulos, making its appearance in the traditional celebrations of Popayán, especially at Christmas time and at the end of the year.\n\nOn the plateau of Popayán, groups of farmers play stringed instruments, composed of three guitars and maracas which have incorporated into their repertoire paseos, merengues, pasillos and boleros in vocal and instrumental form.\n\nPopayán has been declared a City of Gastronomy by UNESCO, in tribute to its significant tradition of regional cooking. Typical dishes of the city are a legacy of both Spanish and indigenous cultural interaction, integrating components of local origin with fruits brought from Spain.\n\nThe National Gastronomy Congress of Popayán has been held each September since 2003, and in 2005 was recognized by UNESCO as a cultural heritage event of the United Nations creative network. The Congress is organized by the Gastronomic Corporation of Popayán, which has presented seven events which have also featured the participation of various countries as special guests: Peru, Brazil, Spain, Chile, Mexico, Italy and France. Today, this congress is recognized as the second largest popular event in the Cauca Department. As it has an academic format, it is distinguished from other culinary events and is the only one to be listed nationally.\n\n\n\n\nChristmas Eve plate or dish is very special. Its content is the most complete of Colombia and consists of , rosquillas, manjar blanco, dulce cortado, natillas and fig syrups, among others.\n\nTraditional cinema is represented in the city by the Bolivar Cultural Center, which shows independent films. There is also a theater, the Royal Films multiplex in the Campanario Mall, which has four modern 3D digital cinema screens, and a new theater, Cine Colombia multiplex in the Terra plaza Mall (the newest in the city)\n\nIn addition there are several film clubs, many of them located within the University of Cauca. The Cineclub La Tuátara runs every Wednesday in the Comfacauca Institute of Technology auditorium (opened 2001), which has established itself as a cultural space for the city.\n\nA very important innovation is the program of the Radio Universidad del Cauca station 104.1 fm, 'Cinema Radio', on air Saturdays at noon, in which are created thematic cycles. They present news about cinema, 'the seventh art', and also discuss the history of film and audiovisual language. \nTalking about cinematographic production, there are some people who are working to strengthen the seventh art in the municipality.\n\n\nPopayan has one commercial airport, Guillermo León Valencia Airport, served by Avianca.\n\nPopayán has a humid but relatively mild tropical climate, more specifically a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: Am) that is close to being a subtropical highland climate, though unusually the driest months from June to August are opposite to when they would be expected, given that the city is actually north of the equator.\nPopayán is twinned with:\n\n1536-1936\n"}
{"id": "17247538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17247538", "title": "Principlism", "text": "Principlism\n\nPrinciplism is a system of ethics based on the four moral principles of:\n\n1. Autonomy—free-will or agency, \n\n2. Beneficence—do good, \n\n3. Nonmaleficence—do no harm, and \n\n4. Justice—social distribution of benefits and burdens.\n\nAdvocates for principlism argue that from the beginning of recorded history most moral decision-makers descriptively and prescriptively have used these four moral principles; that they are part of or compatible with most intellectual, religious, and cultural beliefs.\n\nPrinciplism was first formalized as a moral decision-making approach by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research in a document called the Belmont Report on April 18, 1979. The Commission came into existence on July 12, 1974 when the National Research Act (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law. After four years of monthly deliberations, the Commission met in February 1976 for four days at the Smithsonian Institution’s Belmont Conference Center which resulted in a statement of the basic ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice, for biomedical and behavioral research. The Commission recommended that the Belmont Report be adopted in its entirety as a statement of the Department’s policy for the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n\nThe Belmont Report’s cause of origin can be traced back to December 9, 1946 when the American Military Tribunal started criminal proceedings against 23 German physicians and administrators for war crimes and crimes against humanity. During the trials, the Nuremberg Code was drafted for the establishment of standards for judging individuals who conducted biomedical experiments on concentration camp prisoners. The Nuremberg Code in its final form was established in 1948 and was the first international document that advocated voluntary informed consent for participants of research on human subjects.\n\nPrinciplism is a moral approach based on judgments that are generally accepted by most intellectual, cultural and religious traditions. For example, the Belmont Report defines 3 key principles by which to judge the ethicality of biomedical and behavioral research. These principles are:\n\n1. Respect for persons—Autonomy,\n\n2. Beneficence—do good, and\n\n3. Justice—specifically distributive justice wherein those who bear the burdens of research also receive its benefits.\n\nPrinciplism has evolved into a practical approach for ethical decision-making that focuses on the common ground moral principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The practicality of this approach is that principlism can be derived from, is consistent with, or at the very least is not in conflict with a multitude of ethical, theological, and social approaches towards moral decision-making. This pluralistic approach is essential when making moral decisions institutionally, pedagogically, and in the community as pluralistic interdisciplinary groups by definition cannot agree on particular moral theories or their epistemic justifications. However, pluralistic interdisciplinary groups can and do agree on intersubjective principles. In the development of a principlistic moral framework it is not a necessary condition that the epistemic origins and justifications of these principles be established. Rather the sufficient condition is that most individuals and societies, would agree that both prescriptively and descriptively there is wide agreement with the existence and acceptance of the general values of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.\n\nOnce these principles have been established the practical activity then becomes that of specifying how the principles are to be used in specific situations and balancing the principles with the other competing moral principles. In using this approach, every moral decision will be dilemmatic in that the agent will be to some degree either morally right and morally wrong under a single principle, and/or there will be two or more competing moral principles and the agent will not be able to completely fulfill one or more moral principles without violating or competing with one or more other moral principles. Dilemmatic decision-making is not unusual when making pluralistic social decisions. The Bill of Rights in the United States Constitution perfectly exemplifies this process. A citizen’s freedom of speech, for example, does not allow someone to yell “FIRE” in a crowded theater when there is no fire as individual Constitutional Rights and Liberties are constrained by other individual rights and liberties and therefore they must be specified for specific situations and then balanced with the other inevitable competing principles. \n\nPrinciplism, presented as a formal criterion, is a description and prescription of moral decision-making with a deep and rich heritage that has yet to be formalized for pluralistic interdisciplinary groups. However, since most moral decision-making ultimately use this approach, in one form or another, moral decision making in pluralistic environments is possible as Principlism descriptively describes how people do in fact make moral decisions and prescriptively prescribes how people ought to act based on the intersubjective agreements of common morality. Instead of focusing on the epistemic differences of various philosophical and religious perspectives, Principlism focuses on the intersubjective agreements, and that is why it works so effectively in interdisciplinary pluralistic environments.\n\nPrinciplism could be modified by adding or subtracting certain component principles yet practically the four principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice are broad and comprehensive enough to sufficiently cover most cases and will provide the necessary output power for making interdisciplinary moral decisions.\n\nEven though pluralistic groups will in large part have shared universal values—Principlism, it is still clearly recognized that there is and will be incommensurable beliefs as to how the specification and balancing procedures found in the principlistic approach ought to be implemented. However, Principlism has the advantage over most other moral approaches in that Principlism emphasizes the shared interdisciplinary universal values or principles and uses them in a systematic and transparent fashion resulting in a greater shared understanding and/or compromise. Certainly, Principlism does not claim to be able to solve all moral dilemmas caused by conflicts of beliefs, yet Principlism, without a doubt, has tremendous output power for practicing interdisciplinary moral decision-making. \n\nPrinciplism is unified approach in that each moral principle seems to converge into each of the other three principles. For example, it can be argued that Principlism, as a comprehensive moral approach, is just another term for justice. To the extent that justice is socially valued because of how it effectively establishes autonomy, nonmaleficence, and beneficence, both personally and socially, it can be argued that Principlism only needs its fourth principle—justice, in order to fulfill its moral function. However, this argument can also be made with regards to each of the four principles as each principle seems to be able to include each of the other three principles. Personal autonomy results in the maximization of personal benefits—beneficence and the minimization of personal burdens—nonmaleficence within a legitimate social structure—justice. Likewise, nonmaleficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, beneficence, and justice and beneficence is maximized, by maximizing autonomy, nonmaleficence, and justice. \n\nThe fact that each of the four principles can be argued to be the supreme moral principle further validates the Principlistic approach towards moral decision-making. In other words, Principlism is a unified moral approach in which the addition of each principle strengthens the legitimacy of each of the other principles to the extent that each principle is specified and balanced using independent criteria and yet each principle still supports each of the other principles. \n\nScience illustrates the importance and necessity of such unification. For example, if several academically distinct fields converge on a unified position that would generally give more credence towards that position. On the other hand, if one academic discipline has a hypothesis that contradicts several or all of the other academic disciplines, then that would be reason either to reject that hypothesis or at least to give it some pause. One example of such unification would be the comparison of evolution vs. creationism. Evolution converges in several academic fields such as Biology, Microbiology, Astronomy, Cosmology, Geology, Paleontology, Oceanography, Pathology, Medicine, Anthropology, and more. Creationism, on the other hand, is based on the non-academic discipline of religious faith and is not supported by any of the empirical academic disciplines. As a result, creationism does not have the same academic stature as evolution and is therefore not considered as a plausible option by any of the empirical or rational academic disciplines. Therefore, other than creationism being a curious sociological, anthropological, or psychological phenomena of culture, religion, and/or belief, creationism has no place in academic empirical rational discourse. Of course academic sciences are by definition limited to empirical and rational discourses and some knowledge is clearly not of that category. For example, intersubjective experiences of sense data such as: sight, taste, smell, touch, hearing, and emotional states such as: love, and faith, are real and true experiences yet they elude rational and/or empirical quantification. However, since creationism claims to be an academic empirical conclusion, then it is legitimate to hold creationism to academic standards of universal academic consistency. \n\nPrinciplism validates itself with its universally recognized moral principles of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice. These principles are distinct moral attributes that converge and unifies moral decision-making even within pluralistic environments.\n\nThe goal in moral decision-making is ultimately to specify and balance each of the four principles recognizing that there is no set hierarchical order of principles in that one or more moral principle may override one or more other moral principles depending on the circumstances. Specifying is the narrowing down or making the broad moral principles relevant for a particular decision and balancing is the attempt to maximize, as much as possible, all of the contributing or competing moral principles.\n\nThe following is an approach that can be used towards applying Principlism to a particular case.\n\nDETERMINE THE RELEVANT PARTIES\nI. AUTONOMY\nII. NONMALEFICENCE\n\nIII. BENEFICENCE\nIV. JUSTICE \n\nBALANCING THE FOUR PRINCIPLES\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSummarize the specification and balancing within each of the four principles and then summarize the reasoning behind the balancing of the four principles and present the reasons why the chosen moral decision would have a higher probability of accomplishing the balancing end rather than some other decision.\n\nFor detailed discussion of Principlism please refer to the article by Jeffrey W. Bulger in \"Teaching Ethics\" Vol. 8, #1, Fall 2007, pp. 81–100, Published by Society for Ethics Across The Curriculum.

As a last ditch effort to secure his education, his parents enroll him in a private school called Yokai Academy, which he discovers is a boarding school for monsters. The school teaches monsters how to coexist with humans, including disguising as them, but any real humans found on campus are to be killed. Although he fears for his life, Tsukune befriends a beautiful vampire girl named Moka Akashiya, who enjoys his company and especially the taste of his blood. During a fight with a school bully, Tsukune accidentally removes the rosario around Moka's neck, and discovers that she transforms into a powerful vampire with a completely different personality.\n\nBecause of Moka, Tsukune decides to stay at Yokai. He befriends formerly antagonistic students, including a succubus Kurumu Kurono and a child prodigy witch Yukari Sendo. They join the school's Newspaper Club and wind up fighting a variety of students and teachers, who use their monstrous powers to bully or to control one or more of the members for their own selfish or destructive ends. On a club trip to the human world, they meet a witch, Ruby Tojo, who defends a field of sunflowers from being torn down by developers. They meet Mizore Shirayuki, a snow fairy student who becomes Tsukune's \"stalker\". A group of \"Monstrels\" harass the club, causing Moka to transfuse blood into Tsukune to the point where he turns into a ghoul. Ruby, having recovered from injuries, joins the school's staff as the Headmaster's assistant. An evil group called the Anti-Schoolers threaten to break down the barrier between the human and monster worlds. When Tsukune's cousin manages to sneak onto the school grounds, the club has a hard time keeping the monster school a secret. When the school is temporary closed because of damage, Tsukune returns home to the human world only to have Moka, Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore follow him and hide in his room.\n\nIn \"Rosario+Vampire: Season II\", Moka's younger sister Koko Shuzen enrolls. She, Ruby, and Mizore join the Newspaper Club. On an excursion to Mizore's homeland, they learn of a dangerous organization called Fairy Tale, which seeks to destroy the human world. The Newspaper Club visits the human world where they meet San Otonashi, a former club member, and run into trouble with adversaries from Fairy Tale's 7th Branch office. Chinese transfer student Fangfang Huang tries to recruit Tsukune to join his mafia family. When Moka spends a school day as her inner personality, she is unable to return to the seal, so the Newspaper Club heads to China to get her rosario fixed.\n\nAt Hong Kong, Tsukune and the gang learn the truth about Moka's identity: she was infused with First Ancestor blood by her mother Akasha Bloodriver, who sacrificed herself to protect them from Alucard, the original First Ancestor vampire. Moka's eldest sister Aqua infiltrates the Huang manor and captures Moka to bring to Fairy Tale, which suspects that Moka is the key to reviving Alucard. While his friends train their powers, Tsukune has his body altered by Tohofuhai to handle the upcoming challenges.\n\nTsukune and the gang infiltrate the Hanging Garden: a sky fortress that serves as Fairy Tale's headquarters. They face opposition from their leader and matriarch of the Shuzen family Gyokuro Shuzen, who sends the leaders of the Fairy Tale Branches after them for a series of fights. The group eventually reaches Moka, but must face her sisters Aqua and Kalua. Gyokuro snatches Moka's rosario in order to control Alucard. A character called the Masked King reveals himself to be a clone of Alucard's original vampire form. He reveals that he has manipulated both Fairy Tale and its opposition to determine whether the rosario could control him, and then merges with his monster self, who goes on a rampage in Tokyo.\n\nMoka is mortally wounded, but Tsukune revives her by removing all his holy locks and transforming himself into a First Ancestor vampire. They beat down Alucard, but he revives and reveals that he has hatched eggs in Japan's major cities. Tsukune's friends and allies, along with the two other Dark Lords, band together to fight Alucard and his clones. Tsukune puts Moka's rosario on Alucard, which awakens Akasha inside his monster body. Akasha tells Alucard to give up the fight, and they cast a self-disintegration spell. Now that the existence of monsters is known in the human world, coexistence is now even harder to achieve, however, Tsukune is confident that he and his friends can do it.\n\nIkeda drew inspiration from the monster manga series \"Kaibutsu-kun\" and has incorporated some references later into the first serialization of the \"Rosario+Vampire\" manga. In an interview at Lucca Comics 2012, Ikeda said he is a big fan of Tim Burton and was inspired by his works, including \"The Nightmare Before Christmas\", and particularly \"Edward Scissorhands\" because the monster has a sensitive soul. His first character design was Moka, a beautiful girl vampire with a crucifix around her neck; he then created the school of monsters and Tsukune afterwards. He credits the beautiful girls for the series' popularity and added the fighting elements. After the series ended in \"Monthly Shōnen Jump\" but was going to be featured in \"Jump Square\", he retitled the second series to give it a sense of renewal.\n\n\"Rosario + Vampire\" began serialization in the August 2004 issue of \"Monthly Shonen Jump\", and ended on the September 2007 issue. The first \"tankōbon\" was released in Japan by Shueisha on October 4, 2004 and sold ten volumes until October 4, 2007 under its \"Jump Comics\" imprint, spanning 39 chapters during its initial run.

Most of the voice actors from the CDs were carried on to the anime series.\n\nAn internet radio show promoting the anime entitled aired on Onsen between December 27, 2007 and March 27, 2008. Another radio show promoting the second anime called also aired on Onsen between October 23, 2008 and April 23, 2009. The shows are hosted by Misato Fukuen and Kimiko Koyama, the voices of Kurumu Kurono and Yukari Sendo, respectively. A CD for the first radio show was released by Sony Music Entertainment on August 6, 2008, and a CD for the second radio show was released on June 24, 2009.\n\nA novelization of \"Rosario + Vampire\" written by Fumihiko Shimo was released by Shueisha on April 4, 2008 under their \"Jump j-Books\" imprint.\n\nA visual novel entitled was developed by Capcom and was released on March 30, 2008 for the Nintendo DS. Another visual novel entitled was developed by Compile Heart and was released for the PlayStation 2 on July 23, 2009. The player assumes the role of Tsukune Aono in both games, and both games features new characters exclusive to the series.\n\nVolumes of the series commonly rank in listings of top selling manga in Japan.\n\nIn North America, the second volume of \"Rosario + Vampire\" was featured on BookScan's Top 20 Graphic Novels, ranking at #6 in August 2008 and #16 in September 2008, with the fifth volume ranking at #7 in February 2009. Season II Volume 8 reached number 5 on BookScan and was the top manga in April 2012 Season II Volume 11 ranked number 10, and Season II Volume 12 reached number 3.\n\nCarlo Santos of Anime News Network gave the first volume of \"Season II\" a C rating and the second volume a B- rating. When he gave volume 1 a C, he stated that \"you could do a lot worse\". He felt that \"Season II\" has all the things that made the series good, but the attempt to reboot the series for the new semester caused it to lack intense feeling, reintroducing all the characters and going against weak enemies once again. For the second volume, Santos was more pleased with the introduction of a major villain and the fanservice artwork in the lighter story, but lamented the lack of any visually threatening monster.\n\nMatthew Warner of Mania.com gave volumes 1 through 3 of \"Season II\" ratings between B+ and A-. In his review for volume 1, he felt the first part was a bit weak with \"predictable and bland stories,\" but remarked positively on the volume's cover art and artwork in general, especially the character artwork. For the second volume, he said it was better focusing on two stories and while noting the second story with Kokoa was weaker, it still delivers “quite a few solid laughs\" and helps develop her character. In his review for volume 3, he stated while it starts out slow, he really enjoyed the story with Mizore, specifically the character development and seeing the characters put aside their disagreements for a common goal: to save Mizore.\n\nLeroy Douresseaux of Comic Book Bin gave volumes of \"Season II\" an A- rating. He opined the emphases on sexual innuendo, comparing it to \"Strawberry 100%\", and that the series is like \"The Addams Family\" mixed with \"X-Men\": \"cool, creepy folks at a secret school where they can live and learn in a place free of the prejudice against them.\" In volume 11, he changed his overall view and deemed it solidly a battle manga.\n\nYALSA included \"Rosario + Vampire, Vol.1\" in its list of the 2013 Popular Paperbacks for Young Adults under the subcategory Boarding Schools to Summer Camps: Leaving home to find yourself.\n\n"}

Fiske defined the term as the \"delegation of the production of meanings and pleasures to [television's] viewers.\" Fiske discussed how rather than being passive couch potatoes that absorbed information in an unmediated way, viewers actually gave their own meanings to the shows they watched that often differed substantially from the meaning intended by the show's producer.\n\nSubsequently, this term was appropriated by the technical and legal community in the context of any re-working of cultural imagery by someone who is not the original author. Examples include fan fiction and slash fiction.\n\nLegal scholars are concerned that just as technology eases the process of cheaply making and distributing derivative works imbued with new cultural meanings available to wide public, copyright and right-to-publicity law is clamping down on and limiting these works, thus reducing their promulgation, and limiting semiotic democracy.\n\nProf. Terry Fisher of Harvard Law School has written about semiotic democracy in the context of the crisis facing the entertainment industry and in terms of the ability of people to use the Internet in creative new ways.\n\n\n"}

It was adopted in the reign of Empress Suiko. The emphasis of the document is not so much on the basic laws by which the state was to be governed, such as one may expect from a modern constitution, but rather it was a highly Buddhist and Confucian document that focused on the morals and virtues that were to be expected of government officials and the emperor's subjects to ensure a smooth running of the state, where the emperor was to be regarded as the highest authority. It is one of the earliest constitutions in history.\n\n\nThe degree to which the document matches the definition of a \"constitution\" is debated. While it introduces principles of governance much like the preamble of modern constitutions such as the United States Constitution, it lacks other elements commonly expected. As William Theodore de Bary writes, “Prince Shotoku's ‘constitution’, placed more emphasis on basic moral and spiritual values than on the detailed codification of laws and their enforcement\".\n\nThis constitution remained valid until Ritsuryō went into effect in the late seventh century. It is frequently argued that those aspects not contradicted by any subsequent legislation were still considered valid in 1890, and remain so today. Conservative commentator Kase Hideaki also argues that because it has never been explicitly abolished, it is still partially valid.\n\n"}
{"id": "53756415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53756415", "title": "Sexuality in the United States", "text": "Sexuality in the United States\n\nAttitudes towards sexuality in the United States has had an assorted approach depending on both the region in the country and the specific time period.\n\nThe United States during the early modern period has a reputation for sexual impermissiveness, partyly due to influence from the Puritans. During the Victorian era romance was increasingly viewed as a key component of sexuality. The 1960s are often viewed as the period wherein the US underwent a substantial change in perception of sexual norms, with a substantial increase in extramarital relations. One study of the interwar period suggests that prudish attitudes were more pronounced among women than among men with 47% in a poll describing pre-marital sex as wicked while only 28% of men said the same.\n\nSome scholars argue that American media is the most sexually suggestive in the world. According to this view, the sexual messages contained in film, television, and music are becoming more explicit in dialog, lyrics, and behavior. In addition, these messages may contain unrealistic, inaccurate, and misleading information. Some scholars argue that still developing teens may be particularly vulnerable to media effects. A 2001 report found that teens rank the media second only to school sex education programs as a leading source of information about sex, but a 2004 report found that \"the media far outranked parents or schools as the source of information about birth control.\"\n\nMedia often portray emotional side-effects of sexuality such as guilt, and disappointment, but less often physical risks such as pregnancy or STDs. One media analysis found that sex was usually between unmarried couples and examples of using condoms or other contraception were \"extremely rare.\" Many of programs or films do not depict consequence for sexual behavior. For example, only 10% programs that contain sexual scenes include any warnings to the potential risks or responsibilities of having sex such as sexually transmitted diseases or pregnancy. In television programing aimed at teens, more than 90% of episodes had at least one sexual reference in it with an average of 7.9 references per hour.\n\nHowever, government statistics suggest that since 1991, both teen sex and teen pregnancy have declined dramatically despite the media generally becoming increasingly sexually explicit. Some analysts have said that this points to an inclination among latter millenials and Generation Z to have hyposexual and desexualized tendencies.\n\nIn 2016, roughly 4.1% of American adults identified themselves as being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Roughly 99% of the adult U.S. population is allosexual (experiences sexual desires) while 1% is the opposite, asexual (experiences no sexual desires). One study has shown that there is no correlation between sexlessness and unhappiness, with sexually active and sexually inactive adult Americans showing roughly equal amounts of happiness. Vicenarian women are slightly more likely to engage in infidelity than vicenarian men at 11 to 10 per cent respectively.\n\nSexual relations are typically legal in the United States if there is no direct or unmediated exchange of money, if it is consensual, teleiophilic (between adults) and nonconsanguineous i.e. between people who are not related familially or by kinship. There are however exceptions, with for instance adult incestual relations being legal in states such as New jersey and Rhode island as of 2017. Also, the state of Nevada licenses several of its counties to operate brothels and permits sex workers to sell sex, and janes and johns to purchase sex. There may also be exceptions to age of consent laws in age gap laws, with some states permitting an ephebophilic relationship if the two persons are close in age.\n\nThe 21st century saw increasingly permissive attitudes towards homosexuality, however many laws continued to be heteronormative. One survey has found that millennials, on average, have sex less frequently than previous generations. This has led to some analysts ruminating on a moral panic wherein young adults of the 2010s decade are uninterested in sex. According to OKCupid, Portland, Oregon is the most promiscuous city in the United States. Some studies have shown that Americans in general have more prudistic and coitophobic attitudes to sex than Europeans. Numerical data from some dating services show that black women and Asian men are the least desired categories of people. Some data has shown that the most popular search terms on pornographic websites include fauxcestual themes such as \"step-mom\" and \"step-sister\", as well as \"teen\" and \"lesbian\".\n"}

She looks into some of the shop windows before spying what was a restaurant. She finds a can of chicken in the kitchen, but before she can open it, a man (Charles Bronson) wearing a worn uniform tunic walks in. She attacks him. The man knocks her out and begins to ravenously eat the chicken. The man notices a dove, which flies away.\n\nHe leaves the restaurant and goes to a newsstand. A copy of the newspaper reveals that the city was evacuated during the war. He returns to the kitchen and wakes the woman by dumping a pot of water on her face. He says there is no reason to fight anymore and that she can have the leftover chicken, but eventually realizes that she cannot understand English and departs. The woman is wary, but eats the chicken. She then follows him into a barber shop and watches as he shaves. He tosses a bar of soap to her, then a towel, which she uses to wash her dirty face. They wander down the street, coming to a movie theater. He stares at a poster for a wartime romance film and turns to smile at her. They find the skeletal remains of soldiers at the theater entrance and suddenly grab the rifles of the dead owners, simultaneously aiming at each other.\n\nAfter a tense moment, the man turns and walks away, slinging his weapon over his shoulder. The woman follows him, and the two walk along the city street. They stop in front of a store with a dress in the smashed display window and she mutters \"\"pryekrasnyy\" \"(прекрасный)\", the Russian word for \"beautiful\". He hands the dress to her and tells her to go and put it on. She enters the building, which turns out to be a recruiting office. As she prepares to change into the dress, she notices the jingoistic enlistment posters on the wall. She grabs her rifle, exits the office and angrily shoots at him twice, but misses. The man gets up, looks at her incredulously, and walks away. As night falls, she returns to the barber shop to sleep in the barber's chair, staring at the dress.\n\nThe next morning, the man has changed out of his uniform into a makeshift tuxedo and has found two jars of peaches. He sees the woman waiting, peeking at him from behind a truck in the street below. He yells at her to leave. She emerges from behind the truck wearing the dress. He tosses one of the jars to her and says \"pryekrasnyy\". She smiles, and they walk away together.\n\nAn abbreviated version of the music for this episode, composed by Nathan Van Cleave, served as the basis for the opening and closing music for the radio drama \"CBS Radio Mystery Theater\". The episode relies heavily on the music as there is very little dialogue throughout.\n\nThis episode was filmed on the backlot of Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California, which was falling apart due to mismanagement and disuse (the facilities were finally torn down in 1963). Very little set decoration was needed to create the illusion of an abandoned city. The interior bracing that holds up the facade is visible through the second story windows in the opening shots of the episode and the credits.\n\nThe sound for the \"blaster\" was taken from \"Forbidden Planet\", where \"Robbie the Robot\" exclaims that a Earthman's weapon was \"a simple blaster\".\n\n\n"}

Controversy has centered on cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE; commonly known as mad cow disease), and the use of ractopamine as an additive in feeds.\n\nThe conflict has sometimes been called the \"beef war\" in the media, similar to the UK–EU Beef war over BSE.\n\nThe discovery of a case of BSE in the United States in December 2003 caused the Council of Agriculture in Taiwan to ban the import of beef and lamb products from the United States. The ban was lifted in April 2005, and reapplied to beef in June 2005 when a second case of BSE was discovered. This ban was conditionally lifted in January 2006, with imports limited to deboned beef from cattle under 30 months old.\n\nIn October 2006, ractopamine was banned in Taiwan along with other beta-adrenergic agonists. In August 2007, the Department of Health announced that it was setting a limit on the level of residual ractopamine in meat products, effectively replacing the ban. This proved controversial, spurring protests from pig farmers in Taiwan, and the ban was retained.\n\nIn February 2012, the Central News Agency reported that large quantities of beef imported from the US were being rejected every month due to residual ractopamine having been detected during inspection.\n\nIn November 2009, limitations were relaxed to allow beef with bones still attached to be imported. The new rules also permitted the import of ground beef and internal organs, but it was intentionally made difficult or impossible through technical regulations. The change sparked a backlash in public opinion, and a bill was passed in the Legislative Yuan in January 2010 reinstating the ban on ground beef and internal organs.\n\nIn March 2012, the Taiwanese government announced that it was moving toward conditionally unbanning ractopamine. While the drug would be granted a maximum residual level for beef, it would remain banned for pork, and the ban on the import of internal organs of cattle would remain in place.\n\nOn 24 April 2012, United States authorities reported that a dairy cow in California was found to be suffering from BSE, the first known case in the country in 6 years. Three days later, on 27 April, legislators belonging to the opposition DPP, PFP and TSU in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan raised a motion to vote on a proposal to temporarily ban the import of all beef from the United States, to remove US beef from store shelves, and to seal cases awaiting inspection at customs. The motion was narrowly defeated 44–45 when Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-Pyng voted in opposition.\n\nOn 25 July 2012, the Legislative Yuan passed amendments to the Act Governing Food Sanitation, authorising government agencies to set safety standards for ractopamine. Following this development, food safety and nutrition exports from the Department of Health agreed on a maximum residual level of 10 ppb for ractopamine in beef on 31 July.\n\nThe United States government has made beef exports a key issue in bilateral trade with Taiwan. When the Taiwanese Legislative Yuan reinstated the ban on imports of ground beef and internal organs of cattle in January 2010, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) issued a statement saying that the action undermined Taiwan's credibility as a trading partner, and made future agreements on bilateral trade more difficult. On 27 June 2012, William Stanton, director of the Taipei office of the AIT, said that the issue had become \"the symbolic embodiment of Taiwan's protected markets\", noting on the same occasion that \"Taiwan must undertake very serious reform efforts\" if it wanted to sign a free trade agreement with the United States or become a member of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\n"}

Its artists included Ernst Fuchs, Rudolf Hausner and Arik Brauer among others. Several artists who would later work in visionary art trained under Fuchs, including Mati Klarwein, Robert Venosa, Philip Rubinov Jacobson and De Es Schwertberger.\n\nVisionary art often carries themes of spiritual, mystical or inner awareness. Despite this broad definition, there does seem to be emerging some definition to what constitutes the contemporary visionary art 'scene' and which artists can be considered especially influential. Symbolism, Cubism, Surrealism and Psychedelic art are also direct precursors to contemporary visionary art. Notable visionary artists count Hilma af Klint, Hieronymous Bosch, William Blake, Morris Graves (of the Pacific Northwest School of Visionary Art), Emil Bisttram, and Gustave Moreau amongst their antecedents.\n\nThe Vienna School of Fantastic Realism, which includes Ernst Fuchs and Arik Brauer, is also a strong influence on visionary culture. It may also be considered the European version, with the names being interchangeable.\n\nThe Society for the Art of Imagination, founded by Brigid Marlin serves as an important portal for visionary art events. More recently, a new wave of visionary artists collaborate to function as modern cooperatives involved in self-publishing and promotion of visionary artists through the internet and via festivals such as Burning Man and Boom Festival, and exhibition/ritual spaces such as Temple of Visions, Tribe 13, Psychedelic Dream Temple, Synergenesis and the Interdimensional Art Movement.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "34270831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34270831", "title": "Zeitgeist (film series)", "text": "Zeitgeist (film series)\n\nZeitgeist is a series of three documentary films released between 2007 and 2011 that present a number of conspiracy theories, as well as proposals for broad social and economic changes.\n\n\"Zeitgeist: The Movie\" is a 2007 film by Peter Joseph presenting a number of conspiracy theories. The film assembles archival footage, animations and narration. Released online on June 18, 2007, it soon received tens of millions of views on Google Video, YouTube, and Vimeo. According to Peter Joseph, the original \"Zeitgeist\" was not presented in a film format, but was a \"performance piece consisting of a vaudevillian, multimedia style event using recorded music, live instruments, and video\".\n\nThe film's introduction features animations, footage of war, explosions, and the September 11 attacks and audio quotes from Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche and George Carlin.\n\nPart I claims that the Christian religion is mainly derived from other religions, astronomical assertions, astrological myths, and other traditions. In furtherance of the Jesus myth hypothesis, this part disputes the historicity of Jesus, who, it claims, is a literary and astrological hybrid, nurtured by political forces and opportunists. Part I was influenced by the work of Acharya S.\n\nPart II alleges that the September 11 attacks were either orchestrated or allowed to happen by elements within the United States government in order to generate mass fear, justify the War on Terror, provide a pretext for the curtailment of civil liberties, and produce economic gain. It asserts that the U.S. government had advance knowledge of the attacks, that the military deliberately allowed the planes to reach their targets, and that World Trade Center buildings 1, 2, and 7 underwent a controlled demolition.\n\nPart III states that the Federal Reserve System is controlled by a small cabal of international bankers who conspire to create global calamities to enrich themselves. Three wars involving the United States during the twentieth century are highlighted as part of this alleged agenda, started by specifically engineered events, including the sinking of the RMS \"Lusitania\", the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the Gulf of Tonkin Incident. The film asserts that such wars serve to sustain conflict in general and force the U.S. government to borrow money, thereby increasing the profits of the international bankers. The film also claims that the Federal Income Tax is illegal.\nPart III also alleges a secret agreement to merge the United States, Canada and Mexico into a North American Union as a step toward the creation of a single world government. The film speculates that under such a government, every human could be implanted with an RFID chip to monitor individual activity and suppress dissent.\n\nThe first film received almost universal condemnation from the media, though it also \"attracted massive interest\" from the public.\n\nThe newspaper \"The Arizona Republic\" described \"Zeitgeist: The Movie\" as \"a bramble of conspiracy theories involving Sept. 11, the international monetary system, and Christianity\" saying also that the movie trailer states that \"there are people guiding your life and you don't even know it\".\n\nA review in \"The Irish Times\" wrote that \"these are surreal perversions of genuine issues and debates, and they tarnish all criticism of faith, the Bush administration, and globalization—there are more than enough factual injustices in this world to be going around without having to invent fictional ones\".\n\nIvor Tossell in \"The Globe and Mail\" cited it as an example of how modern conspiracy theories are promulgated, though he praised its effectiveness:\n\nThe film is an interesting object lesson on how conspiracy theories get to be so popular ... It's a driven, if uneven, piece of propaganda, a marvel of tight editing and fuzzy thinking. Its on-camera sources are mostly conspiracy theorists, co-mingled with selective eyewitness accounts, drawn from archival footage and often taken out of context. It derides the media as a pawn of the International Bankers, but produces media reports for credibility when convenient. The film ignores expert opinion, except the handful of experts who agree with it. And yet, it's compelling. It shamelessly ploughs forward, connecting dots with an earnest certainty that makes you want to give it an A for effort.\n\nFilipe Feio, reflecting upon the film's Internet popularity in \"Diário de Notícias\", stated that \"[f]iction or not, \"Zeitgeist: The Movie\" threatens to become the champion of conspiracy theories of today\".\n\nMichael Shermer, founder of the Skeptics Society, mentioned \"Zeitgeist\" in an article in \"Scientific American\" on skepticism in the age of mass media and the postmodern belief in the relativism of truth. He argues that this belief, coupled with a \"clicker culture of mass media,\" results in a multitude of various truth claims packaged in \"infotainment units\", in the form of films such as \"Zeitgeist\" and \"Loose Change\".\n\nJane Chapman, a film producer and reader in media studies at the University of Lincoln, called \"Zeitgeist\" \"a fast-paced assemblage of agitprop,\" an example of \"unethical film-making\". She accused Peter Joseph of \"implicit deception\" through the use of standard film-making propaganda techniques. While parts of the film are, she says, \"comically\" self-defeating, the nature of \"twisted evidence\" and use of Madrid bomb footage to imply it is of the London bombings amount to \"ethical abuse in sourcing\". She finishes her analysis with the comment: \"Thus, legitimate questions about what happened on 9/11, and about corruption in religious and financial organizations, are all undermined by the film's determined effort to maximize an emotional response at the expense of reasoned argument.\"\n\nAlex Jones, American radio host, conspiracy theorist and executive producer of \"Loose Change\", stated that film segments of \"Zeitgeist\" are taken directly from his documentary \"Terrorstorm\", and that he supports \"90 percent\" of the film.\n\n\"Skeptic\" magazine's Tim Callahan, criticizing the parts of the film on the origins of Christianity, wrote that \"some of what it asserts is true. Unfortunately, this material is liberally—and sloppily—mixed with material that is only partially true and much that is plainly and simply bogus.\"\n\nChris Forbes, Senior lecturer in Ancient History of Macquarie University and member of the Synod of the Diocese of Sydney, severely criticized Part I of the film, stating that it has no basis in serious scholarship or ancient sources, and that it relies on amateur sources that recycle frivolous ideas from one another, commenting that \"[i]t is extraordinary how many claims it makes which are simply not true\". Similar conclusions were reached by Dr. Mark Foreman of Liberty University.\n\nIn \"Tablet Magazine\", journalist Michelle Goldberg criticized \"Zeitgeist: The Movie\" as being \"steeped in far-right, isolationist, and covertly anti-Semitic conspiracy theories,\" claiming that the film borrowed from the work of Eustace Mullins, Lyndon LaRouche, and radio host Alex Jones, and that it portrays a cabal of international bankers purportedly ruling the world. In an interview with TheMarker, Joseph said that while the film does mention bankers it does not seek to blame any individual or group of individuals. He argued they are merely a product of a socioeconomic system in need of change.\n\nChip Berlet wrote that the 9/11 conspiracy theories \"are bait used to attract viewers from the 9/11 truth movement and others who embrace conspiracist thinking to the idiosyncratic antireligion views of the videographer and the world of right-wing antisemitic theories of a global banking conspiracy\".\n\nJay Kinney questioned the accuracy of its claims and the quality of its arguments, describing it as agitprop and propaganda. At times, according to Kinney, \"Zeitgeist engages in willful confusion by showing TV screen shots of network or cable news with voice-overs from unidentified people not associated with the news programs. If one weren't paying close attention, the effect would be to confer the status and authority of TV news upon the words being spoken. Even when quotes or sound bites are attributed to a source, there's no way to tell if they are quoted correctly or in context.\"\n\nIn June 2013, Peter Joseph directed the music video for \"God Is Dead?\" by Black Sabbath, using extensive imagery from \"Zeitgeist: The Movie\" and its sequels.\n\n\"Zeitgeist: Addendum\" is a 2008 film produced and directed by Peter Joseph, and is a sequel to the 2007 film, \"Zeitgeist: The Movie\". It premiered at the 5th Annual Artivist Film Festival in Los Angeles, California on October 2, 2008.\n\nThe film begins and ends with excerpts from a speech by Jiddu Krishnamurti. The remainder of the film is narrated by Peter Joseph and divided into four parts, which are prefaced by on-screen quotations from Krishnamurti, John Adams, Bernard Lietaer, and Thomas Paine, respectively.\n\n\"Part I\" covers the process of fractional-reserve banking as illustrated in , by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The film suggests that society is manipulated into economic slavery through debt-based monetary policies by requiring individuals to submit for employment in order to pay off their debt.\n\n\"Part II\" has an interview with John Perkins, author of \"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\", who says he was involved in the subjugation of Latin American economies by multinational corporations and the United States government, including involvement in the overthrow of Latin American heads-of-state. Perkins sees the US as a corporatocracy, in which maximization of profits is the first priority.\n\n\"Part III\" introduces futurist Jacque Fresco and The Venus Project and asserts a need to move away from current socioeconomic paradigms. Fresco states that capitalism perpetuates the conditions it claims to address, as problems are only solved if there is money to be made. The film looks at Fresco's proposal of a resource-based economy, which puts environmental friendliness, sustainability and abundance as fundamental societal goals. He goes on to discuss technology which he sees as the primary driver of human advancement, and he describes politics as being unable to solve any problems.\n\n\"Part IV\" suggests that the primary reason for what the film sees as society's social values (\"warfare, corruption, oppressive laws, social stratification, irrelevant superstitions, environmental destruction, and a despotic, socially indifferent, profit oriented ruling class\") is a collective ignorance of \"the emergent and symbiotic aspects of natural law\". The film advocates the following actions for achieving social change: boycotting of the most powerful banks in the Federal Reserve System, the major news networks, the military, energy corporations, all political systems; and joining, and supporting The Zeitgeist Movement.\n\n\"Zeitgeist: Addendum\" won the 2008 Artivist Film Festival's award for \"best feature\" (\"Artivist Spirit\" category).\n\nOriginally, the film was uploaded-released on Google Video. The current video posting on YouTube surpassed 5 million views by late 2013.\n\nAlan Feuer of \"The New York Times\" noted that while the first film was famous for alleging that the attacks of September 11 were an inside job, the second, \"was all but empty of such conspiratorial notions, directing its rhetoric and high production values toward posing a replacement for the evils of the banking system and a perilous economy of scarcity and debt\".\n\n\"Zeitgeist: Moving Forward\" is the third installment in Peter Joseph's \"Zeitgeist\" film series. The film premiered at the JACC Theater in Los Angeles on January 15, 2011 at the Artivist Film Festival, was released in theaters and online. As of November 2014, the film had over 23 million views on YouTube. The film is arranged in four parts, each containing interviews, narration and animated sequences.\n\nThe film begins with an animated sequence narrated by Jacque Fresco. He describes his adolescent life and his discontinuation of public education at the age of 14 and describes his early life influences.\n\nPart I: Human Nature\n\nHuman behavior and the nature vs. nurture debate is discussed, which Robert Sapolsky refers to as a \"false dichotomy.\" Disease, criminal activity, and addictions are also discussed. The overall conclusion of Part I is that social environment and cultural conditioning play a large part in shaping human behavior.\n\nPart II: Social Pathology\n\nJohn Locke and Adam Smith are discussed in regard to modern economics. The film critically questions the economic need for private property, money, and the inherent inequality between agents in the system. Also seen critically is the need for cyclical consumption in order to maintain market share, resulting in wasted resources and planned obsolescence. According to the movie, the current monetary system will result in default or hyperinflation at some future time.\n\nPart III: Project Earth\n\nAs with \"Zeitgeist: Addendum\", the film presents a \"resource-based economy\" as advocated by Jacque Fresco discussing how human civilization could start from a new beginning in relation to resource types, locations, quantities, to satisfy human demands; track the consumption and depletion of resources to regulate human demands and maintain the condition of the environment.\n\nPart IV: Rise\n\nThe current worldwide situation is described as disastrous. A case is presented that pollution, deforestation, climate change, overpopulation, and warfare are all created and perpetuated by the socioeconomic system. Various poverty statistics are shown that suggest a progressive worsening of world culture.\n\nThe final scene of the film shows a partial view of earth from space, followed by a sequence of superimposed statements; \"This is your world\", \"This is our world\", and \"The revolution is now\".\n\nList of Interviewees\n\"Zeitgeist: Moving Forward\" received \"Best Political Documentary\" in 2011 from the Action on Film International Film Festival.\n\nA \"The Socialist Standard\" review said the film's use of animation and humour gave it a \"well rounded feel\", though it criticized the \"shaky economic analysis\" in the second part of the film, saying \"Karl Marx had already undertaken a more scientific analysis\", adding, \"the analysis is at least on the right track\". Regarding transition to the new system proposed in the film, the reviewer noted \"there is no mention of how to get from here to there\".\n\nIn an article, in \"Tablet Magazine\", Michelle Goldberg described the film as \"silly enough that at times [she] suspected it was [a] sly satire about new-age techno-utopianism instead of an example of it\". She describes the 3 Zeitgeist movies as \"a series of 3 apocalyptic cult documentaries.\n\n\"Zeitgeist: The Movie\" (2007) started the chain of events leading to the formation of the Zeitgeist movement. The group advocates transition from the global money-based economic system to a post-scarcity economy or resource-based economy. \"VC Reporter's\" Shane Cohn summarized the movement's charter as: \"Our greatest social problems are the direct results of our economic system\". Joseph created a political movement that, according to \"The Daily Telegraph\", dismisses historic religious concepts as misleading and embraces a version of sustainable ecological concepts and scientific administration of society. The group describes the current socioeconomic system as structurally corrupt and inefficient in the use of resources. Michelle Goldberg described the Zeitgeist movement as \"the first Internet-based apocalyptic cult\".\n\n"}
